EDISON, SDG&amp;E MERGER IS OPPOSED BY PUC STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission's staff on Thursday recommended against 
Southern California Edison's proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, 
saying it would not produce long-term benefits for utility customers. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates charged in a report that, as 
structured, the merger would not guarantee lower rates for customers after 
1993. The report also said the merger would worsen Southern California's air 
quality and cause severe antitrust problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis shows that the benefits are smaller and less certain to 
materialize than the applicants have claimed," division Director Terry L. 
Murray said in the report issued in San Francisco. "DRA urges the commission to 
reject the merger unless the applicants amend their proposal to make it 
beneficial to California ratepayers." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's five commissioners will use the report -- along with thousands of 
documents generated by the utilities and dozens of other interested parties -- 
when they decide whether to approve the proposed $2.5-billion merger and create 
the nation's largest utility, with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the commission will hold public hearings on the merger throughout 
Southern California; it hopes to complete its review late this year. 
</P>
<P>
Merger opponents described the DRA report as one more important barrier between 
the utilities and a completed merger. 
</P>
<P>
"This report, coupled with (state Atty. Gen. John) Van de Kamp's decision to 
oppose the merger, constitutes a one-two knockout punch," said Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based 
consumer group that is opposing the merger that Edison proposed in 1988. "We'll 
never see this merger occur." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp on Wednesday said he would oppose the merger because it violates 
antitrust laws and would damage air quality in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor said the PUC staffers agreed with the city on the "key 
issues we have been arguing from day one. I think this is very, very 
significant, especially coming on the heels of the Attorney General getting 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the commissioners) overthrow (the recommendation), I mean I've got to 
tell you I don't understand, because everybody who looks at it -- except for 
the utilities -- says it's not a good deal," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
But the utilities were "basically encouraged by the tone of the DRA report," 
Edison spokesman Louis Phelps said. "They're basically saying that they have 
concerns, and we're saying that we think we can resolve those concerns." Phelps 
maintained that the merger would produce $1.7 billion in savings that would be 
passed along to customers in the form of lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly willing to open the door and talk with DRA," Bill Reed, 
SDG&amp;E's regulatory affairs manager, said. "I think, bottom line, that they 
have confirmed that there's a substantial level of benefits for our customers." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who last year suggested that the 
state needed to toughen regulations governing utility mergers, said Thursday 
that he is "not convinced that the guarantees for rate reductions were there. 
Without guarantees, they probably shouldn't be doing the merger." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC staff based its report on an "independent forecast" that tracked the 
utilities' claim that a merger would produce significant savings for utility 
customers by reducing operating, labor and fuel costs. The forecast suggested 
that customers would be better off without a merger because it could "result in 
slightly higher rates in the long-run." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC report also noted that while Edison and SDG&amp;E had guaranteed rate 
savings through 1993, "there is no mechanism to ensure that ratepayers will 
receive one cent of the savings after 1993." Edison and SDG&amp;E have 
maintained that the bulk of the merger's savings would accrue in the long-term. 
</P>
<P>
On the complex question of antitrust issues, the report said that the merger 
would bolster Edison's ability to buy bulk power from other utilities but 
create long-term problems for a handful of small, municipally owned utilities 
in Southern California that import electrical power through Edison's impressive 
transmission grid. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we know so far about DRA's position on anti-competitive issues 
and access to the transmission system of the merged utilities . . . we believe 
these issues can be resolved," Edison's Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison "strongly disagrees" with the staff report's demand that Edison sell 
its unregulated Mission Energy subsidiary, which is generating an increasing 
percentage of Edison's net profit. The DRA and Edison have been feuding for 
more than a year over Edison's "self-dealings" with Mission, a wholly owned 
company that generates electrical power for sale to utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Larry O'Donnell, a businessman who formed a San Diego-based group that supports 
the proposed utility merger, described most of the PUC's conditions as 
"bridgeable." But O'Donnell said Edison is unlikely to sell Mission Energy. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell also cautioned that the report is not the commission's final word on 
the complex merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing to remember is that the DRA often stakes out a strong 
position which the commissioners often toss out," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Deputy City Atty. William Shaffran, who has long represented the city 
in utility matters, doubted that Thursday's seemingly negative report would 
dissuade Edison and SDG&amp;E from seeking to complete the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll just plow on," Shaffran said. "I wish I could foresee them quitting, 
but I just don't see that. They'll just keep on going and take their chances."

R. L. KELLEY, 93; FIRST PUBLISHED BLUE BOOK ON USED-CAR VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
R. Leslie (Les) Kelley, a minister's son who as a car dealer in 1926 began 
publishing a Blue Book that has since become the bible of the used-car business 
in terms of establishing automobile market value, died Wednesday at his home in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time owner of the Kelley Kar Co. and Les Kelley Ford -- once the 
largest Ford dealership in the world -- was 93 and had been ill for some time, 
a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Arkansas, the son of a Methodist minister, Kelley moved to Los Angeles 
as a youth and attended USC before opening his first used-car dealership in 
1918. That was the forerunner of his car company and eventually his Ford 
dealership, which at one time had 625 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley closed the dealership in 1962 and retired. At that time, his Kelley Blue 
Book was in use by 95% of the automotive trade, banks, financial institutions 
and courts of law in the West in establishing the value of cars. 
</P>
<P>
The company in recent years has expanded and now publishes subscriptions to 
valuations of both new and used cars and motorcycles as well as recreation 
vehicles. Kelley Blue Book remains a family enterprise and today is operated by 
Les Kelley's brother, S. H. Kelley, a nephew, Robert Kelley, and a grandnephew, 
Michael Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
Les Kelley was a philanthropist and funded a family health center and clinic at 
Santa Monica Hospital and contributed to the restoration of the Hollywood sign, 
which he could see from his home. A golf tournament at the Bel-Air Country Club 
where he was a longtime member has been named for him. 
</P>
<P>
With him when he died was his wife, IngLis. His other survivors include an 
additional brother, two daughters, a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service will be held Monday at 12:30 at Wee Kirk o'-the Heather 
Chapel, Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Glendale.

ONLY IN L.A. / STEVE HARVEY

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two readers with inquiring minds, Harry Bradley and Robert Jeffers, phoned 
separately to ask why, in these energy-conscious times, the Department of Water 
and Power building downtown is lit up like a Christmas tree at night. 
</P>
<P>
'Cause . . . it's party time! 
</P>
<P>
The DWP is throwing a birthday bash for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ed Freudenburg explained that the lights-are-on-but-nobody's-home 
arrangement is in effect between dusk and 11 p.m. "in honor of the 25th 
anniversary of the building," which opened in June, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP, still smarting from city Controller Rick Tuttle's criticism of two 
department lunches totaling $1,800 last year, pointed out that the lighting 
costs only "about $90" per day. (Or about $15,000 for the six-month 
celebration.) 
</P>
<P>
Freudenburg also said that the lighting consists only of florescent tubing 
around the outside of each floor, which gives the impression that the 15-layer 
birthday building is more brightly lit than it is. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's a real surprise party, especially for rate-payers. 
</P>
<P>
You often hear about youthful hackers tapping into complex computer systems. 
But USC freshman Tim Needham used an old-fashioned method the other day to 
prove there was something faulty with the new, sophisticated security system at 
his campus housing facility. 
</P>
<P>
He kicked the door in. 
</P>
<P>
That is, the inside door. First, he had to open the locked outside door. He 
accomplished that by jerking the door "a couple of times." And Needham isn't 
built like a USC football player. 
</P>
<P>
His feat, which was witnessed by the Daily Trojan's Michael Utley as well as by 
an officer of the private security firm that installed the device, set off 
fears about the system, which is scheduled to be placed in more than 50 
buildings on or near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Ward, head of USC's campus police, said that he believes the faulty 
setup was confined to one entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"The outside door was broken and there was some warping on the inside one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As proof that the system works elsewhere, he said that there have since been 
two separate cases of students trying unsuccessfully to kick in other doors. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the security company should put them on the payroll as system-testers. 
</P>
<P>
Just when Santa Monica's leaders were no doubt ready to declare "When Veronica 
Plays Her Harmonica Down on the Pier at Santa Monica" as the city's official 
song, they found a forgotten 1960s tune about the amusement zone. 
</P>
<P>
It's "Santa Monica Pier," recorded by Noel Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
The stirring lyrics include: 
</P>
<P>
I took you down to the pier, dear. 
</P>
<P>
 It was such a fine idea-r. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and chips and the beer, dear, 
</P>
<P>
 Down on Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 While Harrison also croons about "the music of the merry-go-round," there 
isn't a single mention of Veronica's musical instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Pier Song 1, Dan Shapiro thinks it would have become a perennial 
holiday tune (like Jose Feliciano's "Feliz Navidad") if only the title had been 
extended to read: 
</P>
<P>
"When Veronica Plays Her Harmonica Down on the Pier at Santa Monica on 
Hanukkah."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MANHATTAN BEACH ACTS TO CURB STREET NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach City Council is moving to control noise by reducing the 
hours during which construction may be done and restricting the use of leaf 
blowers in residential areas. The council may also hire a consultant to revise 
the city noise ordinance, which officials say contains standards that are 
difficult to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing this week residents complained of being awakened by leaf 
blowers and of eating breakfast to the sound of hammers and saws. 
</P>
<P>
The council called for an ordinance limiting construction to between 7 a.m. and 
6 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. Saturdays, and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sundays 
and holidays. The use of leaf blowers in residential areas would be limited to 
hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
A vote is expected Feb. 20.

FATHER, SON HELD IN 5 KILLINGS FIGHT EXTRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father and son facing murder and kidnaping charges in the ritualistic slaying 
of a five-member Ohio family refused Thursday to comply with a governor's 
warrant authorizing their return to the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a reputed cult leader, and his 
19-year-old son, Damon, now have 10 days to file a petition for a writ of 
habeas corpus challenging the order. 
</P>
<P>
But that deadline can be extended should the defense need more time to review 
the information in the case, said John Hewicker, a San Diego County deputy 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The Lundgrens, who have been jailed in San Diego since their arrest last month 
in National City, were dressed in blue prison uniforms and remained silent 
throughout the 15-minute hearing before Municipal Judge William Woodward. 
</P>
<P>
Hewicker said the case will now go to Superior Court, where a judge will decide 
either to deny the petition or grant the writ. 
</P>
<P>
"If the court denies the petition, we could have agents out here to pick them 
up within three weeks," Hewicker said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that if the Superior Court grants a hearing on the writ, it 
could take up to six weeks before the two could be forced to return to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
But Hewicker said that even if the writ if denied, the case can still be 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hewicker said he does not foresee any problem in eventually returning 
the pair to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, his wife, Alice, 38, and their son were arrested on fugitive 
allegations outside a National City motel following a nationwide manhunt for 13 
members of a cult indicted in the Ohio slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Lundgren waived extradition and was returned to Ohio, where she has 
pleaded innocent to charges of complicity to aggravated murder, conspiracy and 
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren and his son are charged with aggravated murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Lundgren faces the death sentence if convicted of charges stemming 
from the slayings of Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl and their three daughters, 
Hewicker said. 
</P>
<P>
The family's bodies were found in early January buried under a barn on a farm 
in Kirtland, Ohio. Lundgren and his followers had lived on the rented farm 
until leaving last April, when authorities believe the family was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Reputed cult members Kathryn Johnson, 36, and Daniel David Kraft, 25, who were 
arrested in eastern San Diego County, are scheduled to be in court today for a 
hearing regarding the status of their extradition proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
They are also fighting extradition and remain jailed without bail in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Eight other cult members face charges in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Lundgren formerly was a lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints before being defrocked in January, 1988, for 
radical teachings, according to church officials. 
</P>
<P>
He later formed the sect, persuading some former church members to follow him.

BEEN BURGLARIZED? POLICE LOOT JUST MIGHT INTEREST YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance police are looking for Bill West, Tracy, D. B. J. and others whose 
homes have been burglarized in the last two years in cities throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
West's name was found inscribed on a 1962 class ring from USC. Tracy is missing 
a charm bracelet and D. B. J. a gold pocket watch. The items are part of a huge 
cache of stolen merchandise collecting dust at the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
All of the items, which have an estimated value of $50,000, will be displayed 
today from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Torrance police headquarters, 3300 Civic Center 
Drive, in an attempt to return the loot to the rightful owners. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they recovered the items after arresting John Wesley Milligan, 27, 
last month on burglary charges. Milligan, dressed in a blue suit and tie, was 
spotted climbing into a window of a Torrance home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Milligan's home in Carson uncovered thousands of dollars' worth of 
property that police say was taken from residences throughout Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan, who has pleaded guilty to two burglary charges, is in the custody of 
the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, police said. Four additional burglary 
charges against him are being filed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Property has already been returned to victims in Rancho Palos Verdes, Long 
Beach, Huntington Beach and Torrance. But the police still have a Yamaha 
keyboard, a gold-colored locket with the initials EML on one side, a pair of 
pewter Indian scout statuettes and other valuables. 
</P>
<P>
At the public viewing today, police said they will ask those claiming the 
merchandise to describe their missing items and show police reports documenting 
a burglary at their home. Items that are not claimed may be sold at the next 
police auction. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll screen people before they see the stuff so that they don't come up and 
just say, 'Yes, that's mine,' " Sgt. Ronald Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are confident that the owner of one item is sure to show up if the 
message gets out. 
</P>
<P>
"The strangest thing we have is a three-quarter-length hooded coat made of 
skunk fur," Detective Pete Velis said. "It has to be the ugliest thing I've 
ever seen in my life. It's one of a kind."

Sixty-six miners were feared dead in an explosion and fire in an underground 
coal pit, and angry workers blamed poor safety precautions for one of Turkey's 
worst mining disasters. Officials at the Yeniceltek lignite mine said they have 
given up hope of rescuing alive 58 miners trapped 1,050 feet below the surface 
after a methane gas explosion and fire. Eight bodies were brought from the 
mine.

A 20-year-old man was found guilty of second-degree murder in the December, 
1988, freeway shooting death of a man driving home from an anniversary dinner 
party. 
</P>
<P>
An Alameda County Superior Court jury deliberated for 1 1/2 days before 
convicting Darryl Poole, who sat quietly with his head down as the verdict was 
read. Poole faces a possible sentence of 18 years to life in prison. Lawrence 
Ellingsen, 53, and his wife were returning to their home in Newark after 
celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary in San Francisco when the shooting 
occurred along Interstate 880. Ellingsen, a computer analyst, died instantly 
from a bullet that entered the rear window and struck him in the head.

SCHOOL OFFICIALS AT OPEN HEARING REFUSE TO EXPEL 4 BLACKS; 
</P>
<P>
DISCIPLINE: SUPPORTERS SAY THE STUDENTS, WHO WERE ACCUSED OF ROBBERY, ARE

Over administrators' objections, trustees in the Antelope Valley Union High 
School District refused to expel four black basketball players accused of 
attempted robbery in a case that also exposed the growing racial tensions in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
After an emotional three-hour hearing, held in public at the request of the 
students' parents, the board early Thursday voted 5 to 0 to allow the four 
teen-agers to return to Antelope Valley High School. Supt. Kenneth Brummel had 
urged they not be allowed to return to the school this semester. 
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced a lesson has been learned. Heaven help you if that lesson 
hasn't been learned," said board member Jarold Wright, addressing the four 
students at the end of what school officials called the first expulsion hearing 
in their memory held in public. "If you ever appear before this board again, 
you've had it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The students and their parents joined with classmates, some black and some 
white, and other supporters from the black community to demand leniency. They 
said the four were victims of a racial backlash against blacks by whites who 
believe that blacks are responsible for growing gang violence in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to address ourselves to what caused this to escalate to the point 
where it became a black-white, a gang thing," said Jewel Junior, the mother of 
one of the youths. She and the others said school officials and Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies overreacted, mistakenly thinking the four were gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The only black member of the school board, President Larry Rucker, sided with 
the crowd. "Some of it is racism, no question about it," Rucker said. He said 
black students are being disciplined more stiffly than others and warned "this 
valley is going to have one heck of a time" unless that changes. 
</P>
<P>
But school and sheriff's officials denied that a double standard exists for 
black students. And fellow board member Steve Landaker later angrily denounced 
Rucker's remarks as garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't buy it," Landaker said of the racism charges. 
</P>
<P>
The episode began the afternoon of Dec. 14 when the four black students 
surrounded a car of four white students in the school parking lot. One of the 
black students allegedly placed a gun to the head of one of the passengers and 
demanded money. The black student said he was only wearing a black glove and 
pointed his finger at the white student's temple. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured and no money was taken. But the four black students were 
arrested the next day after school officials learned of the incident. The four 
were charged with attempted armed robbery. A Juvenile Court judge last month 
rejected that charge but sustained misdemeanor assault charges against them. 
They face sentencing Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the school board Wednesday night, the four teen-agers, all 
reserves on the high school's varsity basketball team, acknowledged their role 
in the incident. But they insisted they meant it only as a joke and claimed 
that the white students in the car understood they were just joking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this case has been escalated to a higher level than it should have 
been," said Kevin Junior, 17, who admitted seeking money from the student in 
the car. "I admit it, now that I think about it, that it was a bad joke. Look 
where it got us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior and the other three players -- Martine Stokes, 17, Herbert Sellers, 17, 
and Joseph Montgomery, 16 -- spent five days in custody in Juvenile Hall after 
their arrest. All four have been suspended from school since Dec. 15, but were 
given permission to return Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The four will not return to the basketball team this season, however, because 
they are academically ineligible.

NO GIMMIES ON THIS GOLF COURSE

The burglary detectives quietly shadowed the suspicious truck as it made its 
way slowly through a Van Nuys commercial and residential area. The truck made a 
U-turn, cut its lights and finally pulled over. Two men in black rubber diving 
suits got out with a knapsack and disappeared into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
For the detectives, suspicion turned to excitement. It was 3 a.m. and they 
believed they had stumbled onto a caper in progress. The two dark figures came 
back with a full knapsack and dumped it in the back of the truck in the 5700 
block of Valjean Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Backup officers were called. The truck was stopped. Flashlight beams dipped 
into the back. There was the booty, too much to even count: more than 1,000 
wet, slightly used and allegedly stolen golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
The scene of the crime: the pond along the fourth fairway at Van Nuys Golf 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so disappointed," Los Angeles Police Detective Richard Weaver said. 
"We thought we really had something a little more serious going on. It was just 
golf balls." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Hefley, 24, of Pomona and Scott McQueen, 25, of La Mesa were arrested on 
suspicion of theft. A third man in the truck was questioned but released 
because he did not take part in the midnight swim. 
</P>
<P>
The golf balls rightfully belong to the course, police said. Course starter 
Jack Parrett said employees periodically harvest the pond and sell the balls 
for as much as $1.25 each. "If you take several hundred, you are talking about 
a lot of money," Parrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver said the suspects told investigators that they had earned extra money 
for five years by moonlight diving at golf courses throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
The balls were seized as evidence. Hefley and McQueen remained in jail late 
Thursday in lieu of $250 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
"They are still sitting there in their wet suits," Weaver said.

LOYOLA FACULTY OKS RECOGNITION OF GAY GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Faculty Senate of Loyola Marymount University narrowly voted by secret 
ballot Thursday to recommend that University President James N. Loughran 
officially recognize an organization for gay and lesbian students, which is 
seeking formal club status at the Jesuit-operated Catholic campus. 
</P>
<P>
By a 9-8 vote, the senate, an advisory group of 22 faculty members representing 
each of the university's four colleges, voted to urge Loughran to recognize the 
Alliance of Gays and Lesbians, a newly formed group that has been meeting 
off-campus, said Linda Bannister, a member of the English department who 
co-sponsored the resolution. Five members of the senate were absent. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister and co-sponsor Jeffrey Siker, an assistant professor of theology, 
argued that the club should be granted recognition "because it deals with the 
issue of human rights and (the university's) commitment to free and open 
exchange of ideas," Bannister said. 
</P>
<P>
Siker called the discussion at the faculty meeting "congenial, even collegial. 
. . . Some members were concerned of even appearing to be discriminating 
against gay students at a liberal arts school." 
</P>
<P>
However, Siker said, other faculty members argued that approving such a group 
would go against the university's principles and philosophy as a Catholic 
university. 
</P>
<P>
A support group for gay law students, the Lesbian and Gay Student Union, was 
formed in the mid-1970s at Loyola Law School. Donald P. Merrifield, then 
university president, approved the group, saying it advocated human rights but 
did not promote a gay life style. 
</P>
<P>
Siker said some faculty members said it would not be fair to set a different 
standard for the university's undergraduate students. 
</P>
<P>
The group seeking recognition includes about a dozen students, who began 
holding support meetings in the spring of 1989 in an off-campus apartment, said 
senior James Munselle, who is president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Munselle has retained attorney Gloria Allred, who sent a letter to Loughran on 
Wednesday urging him to recognize the group. 
</P>
<P>
Campus policy for starting a new club requires the approval of the student 
affairs committee, which voted 9 to 2 last December to grant the club formal 
recognition. The group also has drafted a constitution, as required, which 
describes its goals as providing support for gays and lesbians on campus, 
promoting awareness and sensitivity to the gay community, and supporting human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount's student senate voted 12 to 4 last week to approve a 
resolution urging Loughran to approve the club. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision, however, is up to Loughran. University spokeswoman Leah 
Chester-Davis said Thursday that the president had yet to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
If the group is granted recognition, it would gain the right to hold meetings 
on campus, to advertise events and speakers in the campus newsletter, and would 
be eligible for funding through the controller's office, according to policies 
outlined in the Loyola Marymount student handbook.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old man who admitted killing his mistress was sentenced Thursday to 
26 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Filomeno Huerta, 24, was convicted of murder Jan. 11 in the Sept. 5, 1989, 
slaying of Silvia Flores, 23, also from Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge William Kennedy also fined Huerta $200. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Probation Department, Huerta said he killed the woman 
because "anger overcame me." He denied planning to kill Flores earlier. 
</P>
<P>
She was stabbed and had her head smashed against a concrete block. Her badly 
decomposed body was found Sept. 16 in a drainage ditch off San Pasqual Road 
near the San Diego Wild Animal Park. 
</P>
<P>
Huerta said he believed that Flores had told his wife about their affair, 
causing his wife to go back to Mexico.

MAJOR AIDS-RELATED STUDY LAUNCHED IN S.D.; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: RESEARCH AT NEW HILLCREST FACILITY WILL FOCUS ON THE EFFECT HIV VIRUS 
HAS ON 410 SUBJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego's Medical Center, the U.S. Navy and the Veteran's Administration 
on Thursday unveiled a unique, federally funded facility that researchers will 
use to determine how the virus that causes AIDS affects the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
A wide-ranging team of medical researchers, including virologists, 
neurologists, psychologists and psychiatrists, will study the impact that human 
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, has on the nervous systems of 290 HIV-positive 
volunteers from the Navy and Marine Corps and 120 HIV-positive civilians who 
live in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "basic biological responses," researchers will study the impact 
that important "life events" have on the subjects, Dr. J. Hampton Atkinson, 
co-director of the HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center in Hillcrest said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The five-year study, funded by a $19.5-million grant from the National 
Institutes of Mental Health, is designed to determine if HIV-positive 
individuals can delay neurological impairment such as loss of memory. 
</P>
<P>
The study will help determine if "healthy coping mechanisms and social support 
groups . . . (can slow) the rate of progression from infection with HIV, to 
symptoms of HIV, to full-blown AIDS," Atkinson said. "We'd like to identify if 
people who cope poorly are more likely to become sicker faster, or develop 
central nervous system problems." 
</P>
<P>
"If some brain impairment begins at a relatively early stage, and treatments 
can be commenced that will delay it, we want to know about it," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has been pressing for a neurological impact study since the mid-1980s, 
when it became apparent that the Armed Forces would one day have a relatively 
large number of HIV-infected people. The Navy hopes to learn when HIV-positive 
individuals should be withdrawn from jobs that "could endanger themselves or 
others," said Capt. James Chandler, chairman of the psychiatry department at 
the Naval Hospital in Balboa Park. "There is a direct military implication," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy personnel who test positive for HIV are typically reassigned to bases near 
large Navy hospitals in Balboa Park and three other U.S. locations that conduct 
HIV screening. After evaluation, some naval personnel are "reassigned to 
limited duty," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Many members of that HIV-infected population have remained in San Diego on 
active duty or after accepting medical discharges, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's strong involvement in the research program is important, Chandler 
said, because the Armed Forces have been testing personnel for HIV since 1984. 
That testing program has generated a "unique population for whom the timing of 
(HIV) infection is fairly well established," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Because that population's infection dates are fairly well documented, 
researchers can more accurately track HIV's impact on the nervous system, 
Chandler said. It is difficult to determine when most people were infected with 
HIV, so the Navy population is "an important resource," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
During coming years, researchers will use a wide array of tests to learn what 
occurs to volunteers' nervous systems. Researchers will use high-tech Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging devices to gain detailed images of volunteers' brains. They 
will also will draw samples of the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord, 
and chart how fast nerves conduct electrical impulses. 
</P>
<P>
Because some volunteers will die before the five-year study ends, participants 
are being asked to agree to a "special autopsy . . . (that will) carefully 
examine the brain and other tissues" to better understand HIV's impact on 
infected individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The study is still seeking participants. Interested volunteers can call 
543-5000.

WEEKENDER: BLACK HISTORY MONTH EVENTS PAY TRIBUTE TO THE IMPACT OF BLACKS IN 
AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It started as a 10-ton block of sand on the concourse of Hawthorne Plaza. But 
every day, faces out of black history emerge at the hands of sand sculptor Todd 
Vander Pluym and his crew. 
</P>
<P>
With passers-by watching Tuesday, the faces of Shirley Chisholm, the first 
black woman to serve in the U.S. Congress, and musician Stevie Wonder appeared. 
Before the work is completed next week, six more figures from black history -- 
from 19th Century underground railroad "conductor" Harriet Tubman to medical 
pioneer Dr. Charles Drew and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- 
will have taken shape. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Magiliaccio, marketing director of the Hawthorne mall, said that 65% of 
his shoppers are black, and the mall wanted to do "something special" for Black 
History Month during February. "This is our interpretation of history," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mall is not alone in paying tribute during the month to the black impact on 
America. Cities, schools and libraries are joining in, and local events include 
free dance and musical performances, community festivals, an essay contest, 
storytelling, poetry, a program honoring black students, and discussions about 
black athletes and black activism and politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is to bring forth individuals who have made significant 
contributions . . . and to elevate the self-esteem of young blacks," said Kai 
Parker, who first organized Gardena's annual Black History Month celebration 
nine years ago primarily for students. "We teach them their history so they can 
produce their dreams," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Among Gardena's events this year is the city's first African-American Cultural 
Fair on Feb. 24 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Rowley Park Community Center, 13220 
Van Ness Ave. Attractions will include arts and crafts, food, storytelling, and 
booths providing books on African and black culture and information about 
getting into college and fighting illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Dominguez Hills, philosophy professor and African-American History 
Month chairman Rudy Vanterpool said events will emphasize "contributions made 
by African-Americans, from medicine to sports to education, art and politics. 
The idea is to capture the imagination and interest of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
In daylong programs Wednesday and Thursday, the university -- 1000 E. Victoria 
St., Carson -- will spotlight high school academic excellence and will present 
talks and workshops on blacks and athletics. Among speakers will be tennis star 
Arthur Ashe and sports critic Richard Lapchick . Public lectures will be given 
Wednesday at 2 p.m. by Lapchick, who will speak on the politics of sports, and 
Ashe, who will speak at 4 p.m. on the social impact of black athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gardena, the university also will stage an open-air festival March 3 from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. with entertainment, food, art, a book fair, children's events 
and information on community health services. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the centerpiece sand sculpture, Hawthorne Plaza -- at Hawthorne 
and El Segundo boulevards -- has on tap: 
</P>
<P>
* We Tell Stories, Saturday, noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. The storytelling troupe 
will present tales out of black literature, inviting children from the audience 
to participate. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
* All That Dance Co. in "Dance Against Drugs," Saturday, 3 p.m., Ken Nakaota 
Community Center, 1700 W. 162nd St. The show by a young cast combines dance and 
narration and, as Parker put it, "says to young people, drugs do kill." 
</P>
<P>
* "A Salute to Broadway" by the Blackwell International Academy of Performing 
Arts, Feb. 17, 6 p.m., the Nakaota center. Highlights from six musicals will be

<P>
Although the month's events focus on black culture and history, organizers say 
they want to attract the whole community. Said Vanterpool of Dominguez Hills: 
"We're trying to create an atmosphere for appreciating and understanding each 
other and opening up a possibility for dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena's Parker said she wants the celebration to bridge the gaps between 
people of different cultures, saying: "We can live together if we can 
understand and respect one another and our differences." Gerald Faris

MAN ADMITS SLAYING DURING DRUG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old Sylmar man pleaded guilty Thursday to a murder that originally 
was blamed on a house painter who said he was a good Samaritan driving the 
victim to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Cunningham pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree murder for killing 
Walter Bickly Hackman, 23, of Palm Desert during a drug deal gone sour on April 
21, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig R. Richman, Cunningham sold cocaine in 
Pacoima and fatally shot Hackman after Hackman decided to buy drugs from 
another dealer. Hackman drove his van several hundred yards from the shooting 
and collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Vaughn Grant, a 39-year-old house painter from San Fernando, was arrested on 
suspicion of murder after being pulled over while driving Hackman's van, which 
carrying the dying victim. Police had stopped the car because it matched a 
description given by a witness. 
</P>
<P>
When he was arrested, Grant told authorities that, while he was walking home, 
he happened to see the van with Hackman slumped over in the driver's seat. 
Realizing that Hackman needed emergency medical treatment, he got in the van 
and began driving Hackman to a hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities found no evidence to tie Grant to the murder, and did not charge 
him with it, but said they believed he was trying to steal the van and the 
victim's money. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with grand theft, Grant pleaded no contest a month later. He said in a 
subsequent interview that he entered the plea because authorities told him they 
would release him from jail if he did. He was given a six-month suspended 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Grant was sentenced on June 1, detectives conducting further 
investigation said they had found evidence that Cunningham was the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Richman said Thursday that the district attorney's office has no plans to 
reopen Grant's case because prosecutors still believe that even though he was 
not involved in the shooting, he was attempting to steal the dying man's truck 
and money. 
</P>
<P>
Officers who halted the van and ordered Grant out said that he dropped a bloody 
$50 bill, which they said he had taken from Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
Grant denied that he meant to steal anything. He never had any bloody money, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham was arrested the day after Grant was sentenced. He originally was 
charged with first-degree murder with the special circumstance that the killing 
occurred during a robbery, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison 
without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they offered Cunningham a plea agreement -- under which he 
will be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison -- because it would be too 
difficult to prove special circumstances.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RECALL SOUGHT OF 2 ON SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small group of residents began a recall effort against two Inglewood school 
board members Thursday, accusing them of not serving the community well at a 
time of "major crisis" in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The recall targets are Larry Aubry, the school board president, and Thomasina 
Reed, who was elected last June. 
</P>
<P>
Both Aubry and Reed were accused of "faltering leadership, lack of direction, 
poor comprehension of major issues (and) inadequate response to board members, 
communiques and concerns." 
</P>
<P>
The four residents who signed an intention-to-recall form were Emmanuel Gary 
Jr., a parent who ran against Reed last year; Mildred McNair, a former school 
board candidate whose son graduated from Inglewood schools; Charles Coronado, 
an Inglewood businessman with a grandson attending Hudnall Elementary School, 
and Tiburcio Maldonado, a parent who has criticized the district for its 
handling of Latino children. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte Bell, a Los Angeles resident who has a son at Inglewood's Crozier 
Junior High School, is another organizer of the recall effort. The form was 
delivered Thursday to the county registrar-recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
Reed questioned whether the recall effort would succeed and said, "If they want 
to come forward with some specific complaints, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Aubry declined to comment because he had not been formally notified of the 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
The two board members have a week to file an answer to the accusations before 
petitions can be circulated. To force an election, recall proponents would have 
to gather signatures from about 30% of the registered voters in the school 
district.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Voter Registration 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 254 to 166, the House agreed to debate a bill expanding voter 
registration under a restrictive rule that limits amendments from the floor. 
The bill (HR 2190) addresses the problem of plummeting citizen turnout on 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify more potential voters, it enables eligible Americans to 
automatically register when they obtain a driver's license, provides for 
registration desks at many government and private facilities and permits mail 
registration. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and GOP sponsors thought they had secured bipartisan support of a 
debating rule limiting Republicans to a single amendment embodying all changes 
they would make in the legislation. Such limited rules are used when sponsors 
fear an onslaught of amendments will kill their measure. 
</P>
<P>
But the unity dissolved when President Bush raised last-minute objections to 
the bill, prompting GOP leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) to oppose the rule. 
Angry Democrats then questioned whether House Republicans, the minority party, 
are sincere in calling for more bipartisanship in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Al Swift (D-Wash.) complained that Michel had acted to "unilaterally 
and single-handedly trash that agreement" on a debating rule. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) said: "This rule itself is an 
anti-voters' rights rule" as it relates to House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to debate the voter registration bill under a 
restrictive rule.

SACRAMENTO'S BIG GUNS ON TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like individuals, few institutions ever get the chance to redeem their 
mistakes. Fewer still avail themselves of the opportunity in as decisive and 
admirable a manner as the California state Senate did Thursday, when it 
reconsidered and passed a critical piece of gun-control legislation it had 
rejected just a few short months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, AB 497, already has passed the Assembly and now must return there, so 
that the chamber's members can concur in a handful of minor technical 
amendments made on the Senate floor. None of these changes in any way diminish 
the measure's central proposals. The current 15-day waiting period between the 
purchase of a handgun and its delivery will extend to sales of rifles and 
shotguns. That interval allows the state's Department of Justice to determine 
whether the buyer is a person prohibited from owning a firearm. These include 
individuals found mentally infirm under law, convicted felons, those found 
guilty of specified violent misdemeanors within the previous 10 years and 
people forbidden to possess a weapon as a condition of probation. 
</P>
<P>
When they become law, these provisions -- along with the legal ban on the sale 
of military-style assault weapons, which went into effect last month -- will 
put California firmly in the forefront of the national movement toward the 
rational regulation of firearms. This is because the singular characteristic of 
both pieces of legislation is a respect for public safety and the interests of 
law-abiding sportsmen and hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the credit for this belongs to Democratic Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly 
of Sacramento, AB 497's author, and to Los Angeles Democrat David A. Roberti, 
the Senate President Pro Tempore. Their unswerving pursuit of the public's 
interest in this matter should not soon be forgotten. Nor should the courage of 
four Republican Senators -- Ed Davis of Valencia, William A. Craven of 
Oceanside, Newton R. Russell of Glendale and Becky Morgan of Los Altos Hills -- 
who broke with the gun lobby and supported AB 497 as a question of conscience. 
No doubt the Assembly will wish to act quickly and send the bill to Gov. George 
Deukmejian for his signature.

CATALINA GOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Catalina Conservancy should be commended for its recent efforts to reduce 
the feral goat population on Santa Catalina Island. Despite the fact that this 
program is long overdue, it is no less welcome. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of overpopulation, feral mammals, including pigs, bison, deer, 
and the goats, have turned most of Santa Catalina into a lunar landscape. It is 
obvious to anyone flying over the Channel Islands that Santa Catalina is easily 
the most ecologically degraded of the entire group. The inevitable result of 
passive management of such mammal populations in the absence of natural 
predators is the extinction of the native species of plants and animals and, 
ultimately, the agonizing starvation of the feral mammals themselves. 
</P>
<P>
I am hopeful that the Conservancy's recent goat removal program is the 
precursor of organized efforts to eliminate all exotic mammals from Santa 
Catalina. Perhaps it finally signals recognition by the Conservancy of its 
moral obligation to restore the ecological integrity of this special island.

U.S. DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial is absolutely right. We must use oil more efficiently. One way 
of achieving this is to replace the direct burning of oil with the use of 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
This can be done in industry, transportation and even home heating. It has been 
demonstrated that the high efficiency of many electrical processes more than 
compensates for the energy losses encountered in generating and delivering 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, using electricity means that we are not dependent on a single 
fuel. If foreign oil becomes unavailable we still have an abundant supply of 
electricity that can be generated with domestic coal and nuclear energy. 
Another plus is that nuclear and coal generating plants don't compete with home 
heating for fuel oil.

COLOMBIAN JET CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crash of the Avianca Boeing 707 flight on Jan. 25 killing 73 people appears 
to have been the result of semantic miscommunication. The pilot of the aircraft 
asked for "priority" landing in speaking with ground controllers. 
</P>
<P>
He said he "was low on fuel"; that "we think we may need priority." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Aviation Administration in Washington, D.C., "the 
world 'priority' has no particular meaning in air traffic control" (Part A, 
Jan. 30). The spokesman added that "if there is an emergency, you use the word 
'emergency.' " Any messages such as "fuel emergency" or "minimum fuel" by the 
Avianca pilot would have triggered an emergency response by the controllers. 
</P>
<P>
Similar accidents could be avoided in the future if all airlines and the 
National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. included a short course in general 
semantics (the meaning of words, signs and symbols and their effect on human 
behavior) when training pilots and controllers in air traffic communication 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
With the ever-increasing amount of world air travel and the concomitant 
cockpit/tower chatter, it is vital that the brief time allowed for 
communication be precise for both parties.

The Wyoming woman must have hit bottom -- or some narrow ledge over that abyss 
-- when she walked out of her home on Jan. 2 and checked into a motel in 
Laramie. Just last fall, 29-year-old Diane Pfannenstiel had lost custody of her 
two children, one 4 years old, the other 6 months old. Her family was what the 
social workers genteelly call "dysfunctional." 
</P>
<P>
She was pregnant again. Four days earlier, she had returned from an 
alcohol-rehabilitation program. Now she had left home with little more than the 
bruises on her back, her neck, her arms -- the ones that came, she says, from 
her husband when he choked and beat her. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, this woman had enough of a survival instinct left to call SAFE, a 
project for battered women. The people there brought her to the police station 
to have her bruises photographed, to have her husband charged with abuse, and 
then brought her to the hospital to be treated. 
</P>
<P>
In the normal course of such sad and seamy stories, this might have been the 
turning point of one woman's long, slow, uncertain climb up from the ledge. But 
something happened to Pfannenstiel at the hospital. She was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In police custody, Diane Pfannenstiel was tested for alcohol, jailed and then 
charged with the crime of drinking while pregnant. She was prosecuted for 
felony child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
So her name is added to the roll call -- not a very distinguished list but a 
growing one -- of some three dozen pregnant women who have become the targets 
of the latest fad of copycat criminal prosecutions. It has become trendy to 
arrest pregnant women for endangering their fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, Jennifer Johnson was convicted of delivering a controlled substance 
to a minor, her fetus. In Illinois, Melanie Green was charged with manslaughter 
for the death of a baby connected to her alleged cocaine use. And in South 
Carolina, perhaps a dozen women have been arrested after the hospitals they 
went to for maternity care tested them for cocaine and turned them in to the 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Behind most of these cases are prosecutors who assume the mantle of protector 
of the fetus, who try to separate the "innocent" unborn from its "guilty" 
bearer. Indeed this mantle has become a popular costume in an era when we know 
and worry more about life in the womb and how it can be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine babies, fetal alcohol syndrome, smoking and sudden infant death 
syndrome -- all these have entered the daily journalism of pregnancy dangers. 
The knowledge of tragic and permanent damage before birth has infected most 
pregnant women with trimesters full of fantasies. Today, it isn't just 
prosecutors who look accusingly, judgmentally at a pregnant woman strung out, 
or one with a drink or a cigarette in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
But this lineup of pregnant women, this police action, threatens to turn 
pregnancy back into a special class again. This time a special class of 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
A 29-year-old woman is not barred from drinking in Wyoming. Diane Pfannenstiel 
was prosecuted solely because she was pregnant. It isn't an idle ride on the 
slippery slope to ask whether women might also be arrested for disobeying other 
health commandments. As her lawyer, Mary Elizabeth Galvan, asked: "If I am 
pregnant, can the state regulate my life? What if I am smoking? What if I am 
living with a man who smokes?" 
</P>
<P>
There is something even more pernicious behind this wave of arrests: a 
not-so-subtle shift of focus. Americans no longer feel as confident in our 
collective ability or willingness to help others. We hear little lately about 
the state's obligation to provide care; little about the pregnant women who 
can't afford proper care. 
</P>
<P>
Communities that are slow and stingy with support may be quick to prosecute. In 
South Carolina, one of the very hospitals testing and turning in pregnant 
cocaine addicts has no facilities for treating them. In retreat from principles 
of communal responsibility, we are trying to force individual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Diane Pfannenstiel was dismissed last week -- but only because 
the prosecutor failed to prove she'd hurt the fetus. If it's born damaged, she 
could still be liable. And if she is convicted of this felony charge, would the 
newborn end up in foster care? What would happen next? Where is the quick fix 
for mother or child? 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the urge to prosecute there is a belief that the addicted woman is 
failing willfully, selfishly, to take care of her fetus. The sadder reality is 
that an addicted woman has failed to take care of herself as well as her womb. 
That is a lesson she won't learn in jail.

UCLA SHOWS IT CAN WIN IN ARIZONA;

<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MARTIN IN CONTROL AS BRUINS JUMP TO EARLY LEAD OVER ARIZONA 
STATE AND SCORE 80-72 VICTORY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just 12 months ago that UCLA rode confidently into the desert, only to 
be ambushed twice in three days. 
</P>
<P>
Swept by Arizona State and Arizona on a two-game trip, the Bruins were shot 
right out of the Pacific 10 Conference race. 
</P>
<P>
It won't happen this year. 
</P>
<P>
A more cautious band of Bruins made sure of that Thursday night by overpowering 
Arizona State, 80-72, in front of 10,994 -- the largest crowd in seven years to 
watch the rejuvenated Sun Devils play an opponent other than Arizona in the 
University Activity Center. 
</P>
<P>
Only mildly challenged after opening a 14-point lead in the first nine minutes, 
the Bruins (16-4 overall, 9-2 in the Pac-10) remained a game behind conference 
leader Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
The next stop is Tucson, where Saturday on national television the Bruins will 
take aim at the Wildcats' 43-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"By us winning this game, we'll go into Arizona with a lot more confidence," 
point guard Darrick Martin said. "We really want to break that streak over 
there. I think it would be right for us to do it because Sean Elliott broke 
that record against us last year." 
</P>
<P>
In UCLA's 102-64 loss at Arizona last February, Elliott surpassed former Bruin 
Lew Alcindor as the Pac-10's all-time leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins faced nobody of that caliber against ASU, but ASU forward Alex 
Austin, who burned the Bruins for 31 points last month, drew as much defensive 
attention. Gerald Madkins and Mitchell Butler harassed him into six-for-20 
shooting and limited him to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Austin missed all nine of his three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a statement defensively," Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State (12-9, 5-7) made only 42.9% of its shots. Austin's brother, 
Isaac, had 20 points and 14 rebounds for the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UCLA made 52.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean had 23 points and 10 rebounds for the Bruins, Tracy Murray scored 
17 points, Trevor Wilson had 15 points and nine rebounds and Martin, 
orchestrating from the point, had 17 points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
"Darrick Martin played a strong game, controlling the action and the tempo," 
Harrick said. "He got us some layups, found guys open." 
</P>
<P>
He has done so quite regularly in the last three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrick: "Since the Stanford game, he's just said, 'Hey, this is my team. 
I'm going to direct it. No one can yell at me. No one can take me out of the 
game -- (not) players, coaches, officials. I'm going to do what I know I can 
do. I'm going to get MacLean and Wilson and Murray the ball. I'm going to step 
up and run the fast break with great proficiency.' " 
</P>
<P>
Martin, asked to fill the void left by the graduation last spring of Pooh 
Richardson, wasn't always so forceful, but he's learning. 
</P>
<P>
"With each game, I'm getting more and more comfortable," he said. "I think the 
most important thing is, I have the respect of my teammates. If I have that, it 
makes stepping forward that much easier." 
</P>
<P>
And if Martin steps forward, UCLA is that much better. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA rolled to a 22-8 lead, making 10 of its first 16 shots while Arizona State 
missed 10 of its first 13. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to come in here and make a statement and show everybody that we're a 
good team and that we can win on the road," Harrick said of the Bruins, who 
lost three of the previous four times they ventured outside of Westwood. "Now 
we've got to go and prove it again." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Frank McIntyre, supervisor of basketball officials for the Pac-10, reviewed 
videotape this week of the UCLA-USC game Feb. 1 and said of Harold Miner's 
phantom three-point basket: "I don't know how in God's name we missed it. I 
don't know if it was just a moment where they, I don't know, blacked out or 
something." With 3:11 left in a game won by USC, 76-75, officials incorrectly 
gave USC's Miner three points for a shot that should have counted for two. 
McIntyre phoned UCLA Coach Jim Harrick this week and apologized for the error. 
"It was a bad miss on our part," McIntyre said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USIU'S KEVIN BRADSHAW, THE NATION'S NO. 3 SCORER, HAS 
SETTLED IN AFTER REDISCOVERING HIS DESIRE TO COMPETE.

<P>
Kevin Bradshaw was a high school basketball star in Florida. He is now U.S. 
International's leading scorer, No. 3 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradshaw did not make the transition easily. The way was littered with 
decisions, both good and bad: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He accepted a basketball scholarship to a small Florida college. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He married his pregnant girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He dropped out of college and joined the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- His daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was divorced. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Bradshaw has plugged away, trying to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
It was a stuffy summer day in Florida. Kevin Bradshaw, fresh on leave from the 
Navy, drove the 10 miles to where his ex-wife lived, outside of Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
It's a moment that has stayed with him. He remembers the creak of the car door 
as he stepped onto the driveway. The aroma that wafted from inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
And he remembers his first look at his daughter, Jiana Cherall, who was now 
nearly a year old. 
</P>
<P>
"That first time was the most painful," Bradshaw said. "I didn't want to get 
upset. I would have said things that wouldn't have helped, but I would have 
said them anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw had had a year to ponder it. It had been that long since he left his 
basketball scholarship at Bethune-Cookman in Daytona Beach to marry his 
pregnant girlfriend and join the Navy to support his new family. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim, his wife had decided she didn't want to come to San Diego, 
where Bradshaw was stationed, leading to their divorce. And his child had been 
born. 
</P>
<P>
So much had happened, so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw was Florida high school player of the year his senior season at 
Buchholz High in Gainesville. He averaged a school-record 30.2 points per game. 
He still holds school career records for points (1,693) and rebounds (584) and 
season records for points (946), field goals in a game (19) and shooting 
percentage in a game (90.4, 19 of 21). 
</P>
<P>
But then came the ill-fated decision to attend Bethune-Cookman. A child and a 
quick marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball, which had been his trademark, was set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's trying again. He left the Navy last year and is playing his junior 
year at U.S. International. The three years away haven't had any apparent 
negative effects: Bradshaw's 31-point average for the 9-13 Gulls is third best 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
He has also adapted to the academic life, finishing his first semester with a 
2.9 grade point average in physical education. Bradshaw decided during his Navy 
hitch that he wanted to make it back to school. And if basketball was what got 
him there, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"For once, I was working, and when you're working, you realize how important a 
degree is," Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
USIU was the first school to show an interest in him. After meeting with Coach 
Gary Zarecky, Bradshaw decided USIU was the place for him, too, and he put his 
name on a letter of intent during the early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit it off," Bradshaw said. "(Zarecky) was straightforward. It's amazing 
what happens when you're surrounded by good people." 
</P>
<P>
And so Bradshaw continues his uneven odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult enough to earn a basketball scholarship out of high school, 
considering the thousands of kids who may have the talent but never make it to 
college. But it's harder still to make it, drop out and return. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw, who will turn 24 Monday, is attacking the basket and the classroom 
with a maturity gained through his experience. He kept his game sharp by 
playing on the All-Navy team and was named All-Armed Forces last year, joining 
future NBA player David Robinson. He is well on his way to setting several 
school records, including scoring and free throw shooting. He is one of the 
best in the country at the line, making 173 of 202 (.856). 
</P>
<P>
Basketball was the furthest thing from Bradshaw's mind when he joined the Navy 
in 1986. After joining, he left it completely for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play anymore," Bradshaw said. "I stayed away for a year. I thought 
'20 years, I'll get my retirement, get fat and have kids.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Earl McKinney, who was stationed with Bradshaw aboard the U.S.S. McKee in 
San Diego, slowly got Bradshaw back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He never knew I was a star in high school," Bradshaw said. "He said 'You don't 
look like you can play.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Bradshaw finally relented, they headed over to the 32nd Street Gym. 
Bradshaw handled the ball, pounding it to the floor and feeling it snap back in 
his palm. And then he took his first shot in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed," Bradshaw said. "It was a brick." 
</P>
<P>
He missed the basket but rediscovered the urge to play. Once again, basketball 
was to become an important part of Kevin Bradshaw's life. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw developed his game in elementary school like most do, on local courts 
against neighborhood kids. 
</P>
<P>
One was Vernon Maxwell, with whom Bradshaw would develop a close relationship 
when both went on to star at Buchholz. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, a year older, went on to play with the University of Florida and the 
NBA's San Antonio Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw was recruited by Florida, Florida State, Auburn and Georgia, but he 
shied away. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the atmosphere of the big schools," Bradshaw said. "I went to a 
class, and it was an auditorium with students." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people figured Bradshaw was a shoo-in to attend Florida, in his 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"Gainesville is small," Bradshaw said. "It has just three high schools. The 
University of Florida is Gainesville. I don't know what was said behind closed 
doors . . . everyone thought I was going to Florida." 
</P>
<P>
When other schools backed off, it became apparent to Bradshaw that if he was 
going to go big-time, it would be at Florida. But he says he had seen and heard 
too many negative things about Coach Norm Sloan's program. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep down inside, I still don't think I should have gone to Florida," Bradshaw 
said. "I haven't seen any black athletes come out of Florida saying they were 
happy there. Or who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a lot of bad things, but people will talk. But it's another thing to 
see the players not happy and they're stuck." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw decided instead on Bethune-Cookman, a small Division I school where 
his freshman-sophomore high school coach was an assistant. It didn't take long 
to realize he had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just awful," Bradshaw said. "They just weren't big on basketball. It 
was just one way to get money into the program. I wasn't happy from day one. 
But I thought I should try and stick out, give it my best." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw played there for two years and was named All-Mid-East Athletic 
Conference after averaging 19 points and 5.4 rebounds his sophomore year. But 
it wasn't working out. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing or another," Bradshaw said. "Slowly, I started to fade away." 
</P>
<P>
What hurt perhaps most was that Bradshaw, once known throughout Gainesville, 
was slipping into obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be hanging with Vernon, and people would ask me what I was doing, where I 
was playing," Bradshaw said. "I mean, I was only an hour and half away." 
</P>
<P>
The pressure began to mount as his grades slipped. He knew Bethune-Cookman was 
not for him, but he wasn't sure what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Then he found out that his girlfriend was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw left school and went home to try and figure things out. After talking 
to his parents, Bradshaw decided the right thing to do was get married and join 
the service so he could support a family. 
</P>
<P>
He chose the Navy because he didn't have a car and went to the recruiting 
office closest to home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was strange," Bradshaw said. "Whenever I thought of the service, I thought 
of the Army, Air Force or Marines. . . . The Navy recruiting office was in a 
mall about a half-mile from my parent's home." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw got married the day before he was to leave for basic training in San 
Diego. The plan was for his wife to join him a few weeks later. She never 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Other people had a big say in what happened," Bradshaw said. "I just felt I 
should be with my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"It upset me because she knew why I joined the Navy. I thought it was the right 
thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw joined the Navy in March of 1986, and was divorced and a father by 
August. Now he had to adjust both to the service and life without the reason he 
had joined in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
All Bradshaw wanted to do was forget about what had happened . . . and forget 
about basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurt," Bradshaw said. "I'd pretty much thrown basketball to the side. I 
just wanted to concentrate on the Navy. It was hard at first. Coming from 
school and going into the Navy. It was like party time in school, (compared to 
the Navy) where somebody was telling you what to do, when to do it and how to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw slowly adjusted. He now says joining up was the best decision he ever 
made. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always taught to try to do everything that is right and do what I 
believe in," Bradshaw said. "If you're not happy, you don't do the right 
things. I think if I hadn't joined the Navy, I'd be somewhere doing bad 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bradshaw's life is improving, but he's still feeling the effects of that 
day outside Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
It was more than a year before Bradshaw got his first leave. He went to his 
parents, then drove to his ex-wife's parents' house to see his Jiana Cherall. 
It was an unannounced visit. 
</P>
<P>
"Opening the car door, walking up the steps, it was like everything was in slow 
motion," Bradshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
There's a big difference between knowing you're a father and feeling what it is 
like to be one. Bradshaw says he wasn't entirely ready for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up his daughter. And did not want to let go. 
</P>
<P>
"Having my kid taken away," Bradshaw said. "I was thinking, 'This is my first 
kid and now I am going to have to leave her.' (My ex-wife) was under the 
impression I was just going to show up, look at the kid and take off." 
</P>
<P>
Bradshaw soon started court proceedings to get partial custody. It was decided 
that the child should be exposed to both sides of the family, and she now 
spends every other weekend with Bradshaw's parents. 
</P>
<P>
He talks to his daughter on the phone often and visits her during the summer. 
But Bradshaw avoids the old hangouts when he's home. 
</P>
<P>
For all he knows, a few people in Gainesville might still be wondering whatever 
happened to Kevin Bradshaw. By now, they might not even recognize his name 
among the nation's scoring leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'd like them to know," Bradshaw said. "A lot of people gave up on 
me."

SDSU ATHLETICS IS ACCUSED OF DISCRIMINATION; 
</P>
<P>
TITLE IX: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION INVESTIGATING CHARGES THAT WOMEN DO NOT 
RECEIVE EQUITABLE TREATMENT. 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Department of Education is investigating a complaint against San Diego 
State University that alleges sex discrimination in the athletic department, 
Athletic Director Fred Miller said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the school was asked last week by federal officials to provide 
financial and other information in connection with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he was confident the department would be found to be in compliance 
with federal regulations but added that the probe concerned him. "It's like the 
IRS; they say they're here to help you, but you get nervous," he said by phone 
from Florida, where he is vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the complaint alleges that the department is violating federal 
Title IX regulations, which prohibit sex discrimination in programs at 
educational institutions that receive federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
Several others familiar with the complaint, all of whom requested that their 
names not be used, said the alleged violations include disparities in practice 
facilities, locker rooms, equipment, transportation, coaching contracts and the 
general treatment of female athletes and their coaches. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being conducted by the Department of Education's Office 
for Civil Rights, out of its regional office in San Francisco. John Palomino, 
regional director, confirmed that a complaint was filed about two months ago 
but said federal rules prevented him from providing details until the 
investigation was complete. He said it likely will be several months before a 
report is issued. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has said several times in interviews during his four-year tenure that he 
was concerned about the department meeting Title IX requirements. But he said 
the complaint was not necessary and the investigation could delay efforts to 
improve conditions by taking up staff time that might be better spent directly 
working to correct the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the complaint said it was triggered last fall by a dispute 
between two women's teams, volleyball and basketball, over practice time in 
Peterson Gymnasium, both teams' home for competition. 
</P>
<P>
The volleyball team, which had been using the gym for daily two-hour afternoon 
practices since late August, was told to leave when the basketball team began 
practices on Oct. 15, the sources said. The volleyball team was forced to split 
practice time between the Women's Gym on campus and an off-campus recreational 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the volleyball team was in the final six weeks of its season and 
contending for an NCAA playoff spot; sources said the team was upset at having 
to move off its home floor at such a crucial time. The team ended up losing to 
eventual champion Cal State Long Beach in the first-round of the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was a men's sport, do you think they would have kicked them off their 
home floor in the middle of the season for a sport (women's basketball) that 
wasn't even in season?" one source said. "They would have found a way to get 
them the gym." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Peterson Gym was divided by a net, and the women's basketball and 
volleyball teams shared it for two hours before men's basketball practice 
began. But this season, Beth Burns, the new women's basketball coach, was 
promised use of the entire floor, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the dispute over practice time might have triggered the complaint, 
other concerns are long-standing, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"They knew this was coming," said one. "They brought it on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the department has been working to meet the needs of female 
athletes and their coaches despite tight times financially, and limited and 
antiquated facilities. As an example of the improvement made in women's sports, 
Miller cited the addition of soccer last fall. But the program offers no 
scholarships and shares its coach, Chuck Clegg, with the men's program. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that about 25% of the school's intercollegiate athletes are women 
and that the eight women's programs receive a comparable share of the 
department's $4.8-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Department budget problems have been exacerbated by an accumulated deficit of 
$518,000, and facility shortcomings compounded by the fact that intercollegiate 
athletics must share Peterson Gym with the physical education department and 
other campus events. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew when we arrived here four years ago that the infrastructure was not 
there," Miller said. "In order to have a financially successful athletic 
program, we had to get football and (men's) basketball in shape. Everything 
else will follow in an orderly fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said a new Peterson Gym locker room for women is nearing completion and 
that a new locker room for female coaches is among improvements planned for the 
physical education building adjacent to Peterson Gym. The athletic department 
is in the process of taking over space vacated when the physical education 
department moved to recently renovated space in the Women's Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said many facility problems would be solved when a planned $34-million 
arena and recreational sports facility is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Construction on the complex is scheduled to begin in the fall, and competition 
is expected for the 1992-93 school year. But the project could be delayed by a 
petition filed in San Diego Superior Court in October by a neighborhood 
association concerned about traffic and parking problems events at the arena 
might cause. 
</P>
<P>
Those who support the complaint say they hope it will force SDSU to address 
Title IX deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Finances, finances, it's always finances, but finances never seem to affect 
the men's sports," one source said. "If nothing else, maybe this audit will 
mean that the time frame for these changes will be mandated."

<P>
AMERICA'S CUP: IN FINAL DAY OF TWO-YEAR COURTROOM BATTLE, NEW ZEALAND FACES 
TOUGHEST QUESTIONS. SOME OBSERVERS SAY SAN DIEGO YACHT CLUB HAS ADVANTAGE IF 
PROCEEDINGS ARE INDICATOR.

<P>
New Zealand's America's Cup legal team fielded a barrage of sharp queries from 
New York's highest court Thursday, while rival San Diego slid smoothly through 
the final court session of a two-year battle for yachting's grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
The one-sided questions from the seven-judge state Court of Appeals left some 
observers predicting the panel would send the Cup winging back to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"From the tenor of the questioning," said Jonathan Harvey, an attorney who 
joined the full house attending Thursday's proceedings, "I would say the court 
was not pleased to have this case before it and would probably leave (a lower 
court ruling backing San Diego) alone." 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand millionaire Michael Fay brought the case to its final level here, 
claiming a one-sided Cup victory by San Diego's ultralight catamaran over his 
huge, 132-foot monohull in September 1988 violated Cup standards of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
Fay left hurriedly after the hour-long hearing, while his attorney, Robert 
Fiske, turned questions aside testily, saying: "We're not going to reargue the 
case on the courthouse steps." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, lawyers for the other side basked in the sun and reflected on their 
day in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the court asked the right questions," said former U.S. District 
Judge Harold Tyler, who represented the San Diego Yacht Club. "It's very good 
from our point of view. . . . The tough questions had to be put to (New 
Zealand)." 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, New Zealand argued that the 139-year-old Cup competition 
always had been contested between relatively evenly matched boats, and it was 
San Diego's obligation in 1988 to produce a fair match for Fay's huge, 
challenging monohull. 
</P>
<P>
The catamaran Dennis Conner sailed to easy victory "violated the concept of a 
fair match," Fiske said, by giving New Zealand no chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
But one judge after another challenged whether "fairness" was required under a 
literal reading of the century-old Deed of Gift that regulates the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had different types (of boats) before," said Judge Vito Titone. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you find 'monohull' in the language of the Deed?" demanded Chief 
Judge Sol Wachtler. 
</P>
<P>
"Did the catamaran violate any of the Deed of Gift dimensions?" asked Judge 
Judith S. Kaye. When Fiske said no, she asked how, if both boats fell within 
the required dimensions, "We can say one is illegal?" 
</P>
<P>
Tyler had a far easier time with the judges, answering far fewer questions 
during his 20-minute oration. 
</P>
<P>
Wachtler asked lightheartedly if the 1988 match wasn't between "a Ferrari and a 
New York city bus," but the only tough line of questions came from Judge 
Stewart F. Hancock Jr. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested the San Diego Yacht Club had a double duty as Cup defender both to 
oversee a fair competition and to try to successfully defend the Cup, which he 
said could put the club in a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler responded: "Yes, but what did my client do to specifically violate the 
Deed?" He argued that since the Deed requires a defender to both manage the 
races and to compete, San Diego had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
If Fay's camp took any solace from the proceedings, it would be in the fact the 
court accepted an amicus brief from 15 high-profile former Cup competitors, 
including Ted Turner, supporting Fay's "fairness" contention. It turned down a 
rival brief from veteran sailing-rules experts in support of San Diego on 
grounds the document was filed too late. 
</P>
<P>
A final ruling is expected within two to three months. If it goes San Diego's 
way, race organizers there said Thursday they would schedule an international 
Cup regatta for up to 20 competitors in May 1992. 
</P>
<P>
If the court awards the prize to New Zealand, Fay's spokesmen said a regatta 
could be organized at about the same time in Auckland. The event is said to be 
worth $1.2 billion to the host city.

FLAT TROJANS GET FLATTENED BY ARIZONA; 
</P>
<P>
USC: RAVELING SAYS HIS PLAYERS DON'T HAVE HEADS IN THE GAME AS WILDCATS SHUT 
DOWN MINER AND BREEZE, 95-70.

<P>
After celebrating its win over UCLA for a week, USC's basketball team returned 
to its normal mode Thursday against Arizona. Just seven days after their 
biggest win of the season, the Trojans suffered their biggest loss. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 22 Wildcats crushed the Trojans, 95-70, before a sellout crowd of 
13,621 fans at McKale Center. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those nights when we just couldn't do anything right," USC 
Coach George Raveling said. "We just didn't seem to show a lot of spunk and 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"They played an excellent game, but we were a big contributor to it. It was a 
total breakdown tonight. I can't think of a game this year where we were as 
poor in all facets of the game as we were tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"It just looked like we had no interest in playing. It's like we were still 
celebrating a win a week ago that's history. I just don't have any way to 
explain why we played as poorly as we did. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a bad dream. We've just got to go to sleep and forget about it 
and get ready to beat Arizona State (Saturday) and get a split out of this road 
trip." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona used a box-and-one defense to shut down USC guard Harold Miner. 
Averaging 28 points in his last three games, the freshman was held to 13 points 
as he missed eight of 12 shots from the floor. Arizona guard Matt Muehlebach 
checked Miner with help from Wayne Womack and forward Jud Buechler. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's defense seemed to bother Miner. But Raveling suggested that Arizona's 
defense on Miner wasn't the key to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think shutting down Miner was a big factor at all," Raveling said. 
"Whoever turned the lights off in our head is the person we should talk to 
because we left our best piece of equipment back at the motel -- our heads. I 
should have sent the manager back to the motel at halftime to check the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"If we think that Miner's going to go through four years and people aren't 
going to get after him defensively, then we're naive," Raveling said. "I 
thought Harold showed great poise out there with the exception of a couple of 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd be foolish to suggest that they won because they shut Miner 
down. If he had gotten 26 tonight and we didn't play with any more gusto than 
we played with tonight, we would have still gotten beat by the same score. The 
only difference was that he would have had 26 points." 
</P>
<P>
While Arizona took away Miner, the Trojans' primary outside scoring threat, the 
Wildcats' front line also dominated USC's front line. 
</P>
<P>
Buechler scored 19 points and had 12 rebounds and five assists and forward 
Brian Williams added 18 points and 10 rebounds. Center Ed Stokes had 12 points 
and four rebounds as Arizona outrebounded USC, 41-23. Buechler, Williams and 
Stokes combined to hit 22 of 30 field goals. 
</P>
<P>
'Our big guys have really been playing well lately," Buechler said. "Brian 
Williams is really starting to click, and when we have big strong guys like 
that we can just go to them." 
</P>
<P>
USC forward Ronnie Coleman had only one rebound and 17 points, and center Chris 
Munk had no points and no rebounds in 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Having already lost guard Harvey Mason with a knee injury, Arizona lost guard 
Matt Othick, who sprained his left ankle with 4:16 remaining in the game. 
Othick had sprained his right ankle in practice Monday but he played anyway, 
starting in place of Mason. Othick had 12 points and five assists before he was 
carried off the court. 
</P>
<P>
Othick said he probably won't play in Saturday's game against UCLA, but Arizona 
trainer Steve Condon was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's real serious," Condon said. "We hope to have him back 
Saturday, but it's a day-to-day thing." 
</P>
<P>
This one was over early. 
</P>
<P>
USC opened a 5-0 lead, but Arizona outscored the Trojans, 16-2, over the next 
12 minutes to take command. USC was held scoreless for the first five minutes 
of Arizona's spurt. 
</P>
<P>
Leading at halftime, 41-31, Arizona outscored USC, 21-9, in the first 8 1/2 
minutes of the second half to put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Arizona guard Harvey Mason, who injured his right knee Tuesday, underwent 
surgery Wednesday. Although it was feared that Mason would be out the rest of 
the season, the injury wasn't as severe as was first thought and he may return 
in two weeks. He suffered torn cartilage and a partially torn ligament. Mason 
attended the game in street clothes. . . . Arizona is 15-4 overall and 9-3 in 
the Pac-10, while USC fell to 7-11 and 2-9. Arizona has won 43 consecutive home 
games.

No lead is a safe lead if you're a worrier like Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
After watching University of the Pacific trim his ninth-ranked Running Rebels' 
lead to 18 at halftime Thursday night, Tarkanian reinserted his starters to 
help widen the margin. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV responded with the first 10 points of the half and raced to a 116-76 Big 
West Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Barry Young scored a season-high 20 points to lead five UNLV players in 
double figures. 
</P>
<P>
All 12 Rebel players scored as Tarkanian substituted freely after his team 
opened a 25-point lead halfway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to rest the first group tonight, but a lot of times that 
backfires," Tarkanian said. "But I like to reward the second group in a 
situation like that." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV led by as many as 44 in the second half in improving to 18-4 overall, 11-1 
in the Big West. Pacific fell to 12-9, 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat was the worst suffered by the Tigers in conference play since they 
were beaten by 40 points by UNLV in 1984.

IRVINE TAKES NEW MEXICO STATE TO THE WIRE BEFORE FALLING

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were more wacky goings-on in UC Irvine's mixed-up season Thursday night 
at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
The woebegone Anteaters came to the Pan American Center trying to stop a 
14-game losing streak. New Mexico State, favored by 16 points and hoping to 
crack the top 25, was desperately trying to take Irvine seriously. 
</P>
<P>
All things considered, who would have figured a taut, 79-75 New Mexico State 
victory? 
</P>
<P>
Who would have known the Anteaters would make 21 of 26 free throws (80.8%), 
force the Aggies into 17 turnovers and rally from 17 points down late in the 
game? 
</P>
<P>
Irvine did all those things and nearly came away with one of the biggest upsets 
in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem New Mexico State had was trying to get up for a team that is 0-11 
(in conference play)," Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, New Mexico State led, 70-53, after Randy Brown made one of two free 
throws with 8 minutes 22 seconds left. The Aggies finally seemed to have shaken 
off the Anteaters, but they suddenly went flat. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman's bank shot a moment later got Irvine started on an 18-6 run. 
</P>
<P>
His three-pointer cut New Mexico State's lead to 76-68 with 3:30 left and 
Irvine kept its frantic comeback rolling. 
</P>
<P>
And when Herdman fed Rod Palmer for a three-pointer, the Anteaters had crawled 
to within 76-73 with 55 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Brown hit two free throws, but Herdman hit a short jumper with Brown draped all 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
William Benjamin then made one of two at the line for a 79-75 Aggie lead that 
held up, as Irvine missed four three-pointers in the final 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Just getting by with a victory wasn't what New Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy 
had in mind and he blasted his players' effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was a no-show tonight," McCarthy said. "We were fortunate to win 
tonight. I'm embarrassed. We ought to give our fans their money back." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Anteaters were feeling "encouraged," according to 
Palmer. "We were down by 17 and no one gave up. That's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
Added Herdman: "Right now, we know we're not in contention, so we come in and 
play hard and try to upset someone." 
</P>
<P>
Herdman played his best game of the season. Coming off the bench, Herdman had a 
season-high 22 points, making eight of 14 from the field, and had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy I'm playing again," said Herdman, who was benched for the 
University of the Pacific game Saturday for his chippy play. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up a costly technical foul shoving Fresno State's Pat Riddlesprigger 
in the Anteaters' 78-75 loss last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all looser now," Herdman said. "We're not going to worry about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer scored 13 points, Dylan Rigdon had 11 and Jeff Von Lutzow had 10 points 
to go with 10 rebounds for Irvine (2-19 overall, 0-12 in the Big West). 
</P>
<P>
Brown had 19 points before leaving with 14 seconds left with a bruised sternum. 
</P>
<P>
Chasing Herdman, who was lining up a three-pointer, Brown ran into a vicious 
pick from Ricky Butler. 
</P>
<P>
He left the court under his own power after spending several minutes being 
attended to by New Mexico State trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Hill added 14 for the Aggies (19-2, 10-1). 
</P>
<P>
"I like New Mexico State," Mulligan said. "I think they can beat UNLV. I'd love 
to see Neil win at Vegas. I think it would be good for the conference because 
no one gives the conference much credit." 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies play third-place UC Santa Barbara in Las Cruces Saturday, then play 
at Nevada Las Vegas Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Just so we keep getting better, then I'll be happy," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
They strung up Peter the Anteater, or at least a stuffed model of Irvine's 
mascot, in a pregame ceremony. Peter joined a 25-foot shark (representing 
Nevada Las Vegas), Cal State Fullerton's Tuffy Titan and the 49er from Cal 
State Long Beach, dangling from the rafters of the Pan American Center. . . . 
Irvine is off until it plays Cal State Long Beach Thursday at Long Beach. . . . 
A loss to the 49ers would tie the school record of 20 losses in a season, set 
in 1979-80, the year before Bill Mulligan became coach.

THE BULLDOGS, 73-65.

<P>
Selland Arena is a place that can make John Sneed puff extra hard on his 
pregame cigarette, an arena where teams who enter with plans to win often leave 
downtrodden. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State has fallen on hard times since Boyd Grant's last season as coach 
in 1986, but a measure of the Bulldogs' former dominance remains at home in 
Selland, where Cal State Fullerton suffered a 73-65 loss Thursday after going 
stone cold in the final 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans went without a basket for 6 minutes and 50 seconds, and scored only 
four more points after Agee Ward's two free throws gave Fullerton a four-point 
lead with 9:54 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were in pretty good shape, and then all of a sudden we went 
flat," said Sneed, whose team lost by 21 points here last year in his first 
season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ron Adams' teams have won only 42 games in his four seasons at Fresno 
State, and 34 of those victories have been in Selland. His hold on the job 
remains tenuous; the Bulldogs have won only nine of 20 games this season, and 
the victory over Fullerton was their first over an opponent ahead of them in 
the Big West Conference standings, in which they are eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (12-9 overall, 6-6 in conference play) beat Fresno State by eight 
points in Titan Gym last month in a game it once led by 25 points. But the 
Bulldogs were a tougher team in Selland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, they're much better at home than on the road," Sneed said. "Maybe 
the crowd gets them going. They play much more up-tempo at home too, and they 
attack the press more." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (9-11, 4-7) held a 32-30 lead at halftime behind the three-point 
shooting of Tod Bernard, who finished with 18 points and two three-pointers, 
and Dave Barnett, who scored 13, including three of three from three-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos scored 22 for Fullerton, Mark Hill added 18 and Ward scored 13, 
including nine of 11 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton pulled ahead by as many as six points with 13 minutes left. Ward, 
fouled by Chris Henderson, made two free throws, and then Hill made a technical 
free throw after Henderson was charged for excessive arguing. On the possession 
after the technical, Hill knocked down a three-pointer, and Fullerton led, 
57-51. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno came back, taking advantage of Fullerton's cold shooting and a spate of 
turnovers. The Titans finished with 18 turnovers, 10 in the second half, a high 
number for a game of this tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Fullerton's trouble was caused by Fresno's defense, which changed back 
and forth from zone to man. "Their spread zone took us completely out of our 
offense," Sneed said. "We'd call a timeout to adjust and they'd go back to 
man." 
</P>
<P>
The defense was unsettling, and it was by design. 
</P>
<P>
"The changing defenses really seemed to bother them," Adams said. "Fullerton is 
a veteran team, and you have to find a way to keep them off balance, a way to 
break the rhythm of their man offense." 
</P>
<P>
As Fresno State came back, Bernard tied the score, 61-61, with an off-balance 
jumper, and then Pat Riddlesprigger gave Fresno State the lead with a bucket 
off the fast break, sending the crowd of 9,733 into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton trailed by two with three minutes left, but played poorly down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
When Barnett hit a three-point shot with 1:34 left, the Bulldogs took a 
five-point lead, and Fullerton folded. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't make very many smart plays when it was within reach," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed would have preferred a timeout after the Bulldog three-pointer. Instead, 
several seconds later, Ward fouled Riddlesprigger on the dribble, and 
Riddlesprigger made both free throws for a seven-point lead with 56 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
With time under a minute, Fullerton failed to foul quickly, finally leaving 
Carlo Williams wide open for a dunk underneath that made the lead nine with 34 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
David Moody scored for Fullerton with 20 seconds left, and then Wilbert Hooker, 
fouled by the Titans' Van Anderson, made one of two free throws with 18 seconds 
left, making it 73-65. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Sneed was already leaning back in his chair, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hindsight now, but this was an important win we really needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After a victory over Utah State Saturday in Titan Gym, Sneed had reassessed the 
season with what was then eight games remaining, including a first-round Big 
West tournament game. Fullerton had 12 victories, and Sneed set the team's 
sights on finishing with 17, one more than last year's 16-13 team. 
</P>
<P>
In that scenario, the Titans felt they needed a split on this Fresno-Stockton 
road trip, which now puts the pressure on to beat Pacific Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Seventeen is still realistic, but now the next game is very important," Sneed 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's other remaining regular season games are against UC Santa Barbara, 
New Mexico State and Cal State Long Beach at home, followed by a game at UC 
Irvine, and the season-ender at home against Neveda Las Vegas March 3.

LEMIEUX BRACES HIMSELF FOR STRETCH RUN AT SCORING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The brace apparently is just what the doctor ordered for Mario Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
The high-scoring center extended his scoring streak to 44 games with his 43rd 
goal in the first period Thursday night at Pittsburgh, then went on to lead the 
Penguins to a 7-5 victory over the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux later added four assists as the Penguins scored five of the last six 
goals to come from two goals down to climb into a three-way tie for fourth 
place in the Patrick Division with the Capitals and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The scoring star has had back-to-back five-point games since donning the brace 
that protects his aching back. After the season he will have surgery, but for 
now, he's in pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's record of 51 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The streak began Oct. 31 against Gretzky and the Kings. Saturday night he'll 
get a chance to extend it to 45 against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, Philadelphia 5 -- The Islanders scored twice in the last 
five minutes of regulation at Philadelphia to get the Islanders the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the season, when they were struggling to get out of the cellar, the 
Islanders were losing games in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
After New York was outplayed for most of this one, Hubie McDonough scored to 
put the Islanders close and Doug Crossman sent it into overtime with only 77 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Healy of the Islanders had to stop seven shots in overtime to preserve 
the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Quebec 1 -- Shortly after the Bruins learned that Randy Burridge 
would be out six weeks with a knee injury, their newest player, Peter Douris, 
gave them a fast start at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Douris, brought up from the minors last weekend, scored 38 seconds after the 
opening faceoff to send the Nordiques on the way to their 10th consecutive 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have a 34-18-5 record, best in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, Detroit 6 -- Dirk Graham had a hat trick at Detroit and Steve Thomas 
had two goals to lead the Blackhawks to victory. 
</P>
<P>
In a wild second period, it seemed whenever the two teams weren't fighting, 
they were scoring. There were nine goals and 11 penalties. DAN HAFNER

CAL LUTHERAN ENTRUSTS FOOTBALL TEAM TO HARPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Lutheran fired one past national champion football coach but managed to 
replace him with another. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harper, coach of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's 1980 NCAA Division II 
championship team, was introduced Thursday as the replacement for Bob Shoup, 
whose 1971 NAIA title was the highlight of his 28-year tenure as Cal Lutheran 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
It became public in August that the 1989 season would be Shoup's last. Shoup's 
ensuing grievance did not complete official university channels until Jan. 23, 
but Harper said the controversy has not affected him. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't bother me," Harper said at a press conference. "My 
involvement has been very short." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Gillette, vice president for institutional advancement, said the 
university had no qualms about hiring a new coach even though there is a 
possibility that the former coach will continue to contest his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't, because the university, as far as the position of former coach, has 
gone through the process," Gillette said. "What happens from this point on, 
we'll have to deal with it when it occurs." 
</P>
<P>
Harper, 53, coached 14 seasons at San Luis Obispo. He coached Northern Arizona 
from 1982 to 1984, compiling a record of 12-20, but moved back to his native 
Southern California after several years in Flagstaff. A commercial real estate 
salesman, he has been in private business since being fired by Northern 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted to get out" of coaching, said Harper, who has a career record 
of 117-64-4. "I feel it's been a five-year search to find a situation that 
looked right to me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Harper was a finalist for the Cal State Northridge football job. 
</P>
<P>
"In my estimation (Cal Lutheran) is exactly the right place to be at this 
time," said Harper, who lives in Arcadia but said he will move closer to the 
school. "I feel fortunate that I was in a position when Cal Lutheran had a 
need, I had a need, and that our paths crossed." 
</P>
<P>
Harper's stocky build reflects his years as a UCLA lineman in the 1950s. At 
CLU, Harper also will be a lecturer in the physical education department. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said his teams have been pass- and run-oriented at different times in 
his career. All three of his Northern Arizona squads averaged more than 200 
yards passing per game, and his 1984 team topped out at 266.5 passing yards per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, noting that he had yet to evaluate his personnel, said, "It would be 
silly to try to force a scheme that would be inappropriate to the people."

EL CAMINO REAL WRESTLERS WIN 8TH TITLE IN ROW 
</P>

The lights dimmed in the San Fernando High gym, except for a single spotlight 
that hung just above the wrestling mat before Thursday night's match between El 
Camino Real and San Fernando highs. 
</P>
<P>
The match would determine the champion of the five-team Valley League, so the 
San Fernando cheerleaders lined the perimeter of the mat and a large and vocal 
crowd was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
But the atmosphere had changed from one resembling a festival to a rather 
funereal one when the lights came back on an hour later. That was all the time 
it took for defending City Section champion El Camino Real to emerge with a 
resounding 56-18 victory. 
</P>
<P>
With the win, El Camino Real (25-1 overall, 4-0 in league meets) wrapped up its 
eighth consecutive league title and its ninth in 10 years. San Fernando (2-10, 
2-2) fell into third behind Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real won 10 of the 13 matches, seven by pin and one on a technical 
pin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the best matches we had all season," El Camino Real Coach Milt 
Goffman said. "We've always had a couple sore spots somewhere this season, but 
tonight everybody wrestled well." 
</P>
<P>
Greg McMurray (119 pounds), Chris Kuhlen (126), Rich Jin (138), Roy Steinbock 
(145), Matt Rohan (175), Oren Auneri (195) and Cenaro Ramirez (heavyweight) all 
recorded pins for El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Tan (154) of San Fernando pinned Andy Hasson 3 minutes 20 seconds into his 
match to finish with a 4-0 league record. 
</P>
<P>
The match started badly for San Fernando when it forfeited the first match, in 
the 98-pound division. But the Tigers quickly took a 12-6 advantage on pins by 
Ozzy Ramirez (105) and Manuel Anaya (112). San Fernando never led again as El 
Camino Real won nine of the next 10 matches.

FISHING NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
SURFACE CATCHES HAVE COOLED OFF, BUT ROCK COD IS STILL HOT 
</P>

<P>
Winter weather conditions have slowed surface fishing, but rock cod action 
hasn't been affected. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay anglers have been bagging cod limits in 200 to 600 feet of water 
using three-pound weights. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach anglers Tom Murphy and Bob Tyler, who fish at least once a week on 
the Southern Cal from Long Beach Sportfishing, test their angling skills in 
friendly competition with each other. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy says that when he comes up with a heavy fish and is sure it will be the 
jackpot winner, Tyler brings up a bigger one. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler, laughing, says it is his strategy. He goes down with a five-hook ganion 
and leaves it on the bottom while he baits up another ganion. After cranking up 
his catch from the deep, rather than lose time, he detaches the whole ganion 
and puts on the extra baited one to go back down quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler fishes next to Murphy and wins four out of five jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kruse of Long Beach returned from a 16-day trip aboard the Polaris and 
won the jackpot with a 114-pound yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Dooley of Long Beach was also a long-range jackpot winner fishing aboard 
the Qualifier 105 when he landed a 154-pound, 7-ounce yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Pam Pena of Torrance, fishing aboard the Sea Spray while 
drifting at Twin Roads, caught the whopper of the week, a 31-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tyler of Long Beach, fishing at Catalina Island aboard the Southern Cal, 
won the jackpot with a 25-pound ling cod. 
</P>
<P>
Harry C. Wang of West Los Angeles caught an 18-pound yellowtail fishing at 
Catalina aboard the Outerlimits. 
</P>
<P>
Don Haynes of Lawndale, fishing from his boat Fisheret in Santa Monica Bay, 
caught a 10-pound, 4-ounce halibut.

ARREOLA RANKED 10TH FOR '89 IN 1,500 RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Darcy Arreola of Cal State Northridge finished 1989 ranked 10th in the nation 
in the 1,500 meters by Track &amp; Field News magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, who ran a personal best of 4 minutes 14.15 seconds to place second in 
last year's NCAA Division II championships, became the first Lady Matador to 
rank among the nation's top 10 since former Thousand Oaks High standout Marlene 
Harmon was ranked third in the heptathlon and eighth in the 100-meter low 
hurdles in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to her runner-up finish in the Division II meet, Arreola placed 
third in the Division I championships and seventh in The Athletics Congress 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Northridge triple-jumper Lolita Pile was not ranked in the 
magazine's top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Pile finished second in the Division II meet, and her personal best of 42 feet 
4 3/4 inches put her sixth on the national list. Her decision not to compete in 
either the Division I or TAC championships might have cost her a top-10 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham, formerly of Rio Mesa High, and Crissy Mills of Campbell Hall, 
also were among the top 30 on the national list. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham, now at UCLA, was tied for 22nd on the 100-meter (11.52 seconds) list 
and was 23rd in the 200 (23.49). Mills' best of 6 feet in the high jump tied 
her for 26th. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham won the 100 and 200 meters for the second year in a row in the state 
championships in June, and Mills won her second consecutive high jump title. 
</P>
<P>
Mills was favored to win an unprecedented third consecutive state title as a 
senior, but she won't compete this season because of torn knee ligaments 
suffered during a volleyball match in September.

CAL LUTHERAN BASEBALL PREVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
PITCHING, DEFENSE THE KEYS FOR KINGSMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With six position players and three starting pitchers returning from a team 
that went 31-16 and advanced to the NAIA District 3 playoffs last year, Cal 
Lutheran would appear to have another strong squad this season. 
</P>
<P>
But third-year Coach Rich Hill is approaching today's opener against visiting 
Whittier College with guarded optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strength will be our ability to score runs," Hill said. "Our pitching and 
defense is very untested right now and that's what wins ballgames. . . . Our 
pitching staff is all coming back, but they've been very inconsistent in winter 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran's schedule doesn't leave much room for error. The Kingsmen play 
three NCAA Division I teams and two Division II schools -- including Cal State 
Northridge on Sunday -- in their first 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, catcher Anthony Espitia and second baseman Henry Campos (both 
All-District 3 selections) have graduated, and shortstop Daren Cornell has 
moved on to the Milwaukee Brewers' organization, leaving a large void to fill 
in the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Brouelette, an all-district third baseman, will split time between his old 
position and first base this season, while fellow seniors Darnell Mitchell 
(center field), Leonard Matsumoto (catcher) and Devon Schutzler (first base) 
will also start. 
</P>
<P>
Junior outfielder Dan Weis is another returning starter, as is Dave Leonhardt, 
who played second base last year before a broken hand ended his season. 
</P>
<P>
Senior right-hander Mike Clark, who had an 8-2 record and a 2.15 earned-run 
average as an all-district pitcher last season, should anchor a staff that 
includes senior left-hander Kevin O'Neill, who was 5-2 with a 3.20 ERA in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Martinez, a senior right-hander, is expected to be the stopper out of the 
bullpen. He will be joined by sophomore Mike Rooney, a transfer from 
Northridge.

O'BYRNE HELPS WESTLAKE GRAB SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Junior guard Dani O'Byrne scored a career-high 32 points and had 10 rebounds to 
lead the Westlake High girls' basketball team to a 56-53 victory over visiting 
Channel Islands Thursday night in a battle for first place in the Marmonte 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors (21-3, 10-2) finished tied for first with Channel Islands (20-6, 
10-2). 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands won the other meeting between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake led by one point at halftime but took over in the third quarter, 
outscoring Channel Islands, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
But Channel Islands rallied behind forward Dani Brooks, who scored three 
three-point baskets. Virgie Juarez added another three-point basket to bring 
the Raiders to within 54-51 with 17 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were hurt by foul trouble. Sal Tauau, and starting guard Cee Cee 
Santiago both fouled out. Channel Islands' leading scorers, Candis Carper, and 
Tauau were both held to 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that we had to shut them down," O'Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are tough. Our team has never won a championship. We were 0-12 my 
freshman year, and there is just no feeling that can compare to this." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders led, 14-6, at the end of the first quarter, but the Warriors 
rallied to within one point at halftime behind the scoring of O'Byrne, who had 
a quick 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that if we were close at halftime, we could beat them," Westlake 
Coach Nancy Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Byrne sparked an 8-2 Westlake run to open the second half. But Juarez scored 
a three-point basket with five minutes remaining in the third quarter to tie 
the score, 30-30.

BISHOP'S GIRL SETS SOCCER SCORING MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sophomore striker Carmel Murphy of Bishop's School has set a girls' section 
soccer record for goals in a season with 55. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy scored two goals Wednesday in Bishop's 4-1 City Central League victory 
over Madison and two more Thursday in a 6-1 victory over Crawford. The previous 
record was 51, set by Laurie Tharp of Mission Bay in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"(Murphy's) fiercely competitive and just hates to lose," said Ren Marquette, 
Bishop's athletic director. "She's fast and has great skills." 
</P>
<P>
Bishops (18-0-2) was ranked seventh in the most recent section coaches' 
rankings.

The University of San Diego made 15 of 16 free throws down the stretch to win 
its third West Coast Athletic Conference road basketball game in four tries, 
73-65, over Gonzaga Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put USD (11-10, 6-3) over the .500 mark for the first time since 
early in the season and gave them sole possession of second in the WCC with 
idle Pepperdine (11-10, 5-3), which is at St. Mary's tonight. 
</P>
<P>
USD point guard Wayman Strickland (12 points) was six for seven from the line 
in the last nine minutes, and Pat Holbert, who scored a career-high 22 points, 
was four for four. 
</P>
<P>
Torero Coach Hank Egan also came up with his first victory at Gonzaga in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to get a win up here," Egan said. "I'm pleased about two things 
tonight. The first is that we won, and the second is I hear this is the last 
McPhee. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga senior Jim McPhee scored a game-high 29 points. His brother, Brice, 
tormented the Toreros before Jim came along. 
</P>
<P>
USD led, 33-25, at the half, but Gonzaga then used a 10-2 run to tie the score 
at 35. The Toreros scored the next five points, but Gonzaga tied it again at 
43. 
</P>
<P>
But the Toreros then went on a 8-2 run to make it 51-45 with 9:14 left and were 
never threatened after that. 
</P>
<P>
"We started playing well right before we went into conference, and right now 
we're getting a consistent performance game in and game out," Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
USD, which next travels to Portland for a game Saturday night, also received 17 
points and 10 rebounds from John Jerome. Holbert finished six for 12 from the 
field, eight of nine from the line and had eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros shot 43% (23 for 54) from the field and 74% (25 for 34) from the 
line. USD was outrebounded, 40-37, but had just 12 turnovers to Gonzaga's 15.

Colgate-Palmolive Co.: The consumer products maker reported that 1989 net 
income fell 12% from a year ago, to $280 million, on revenue of $5 billion, up 
6%. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, the New York company's profit fell to $62.5 million 
from $126.7 million, on revenue of $1.3 billion, up 6% from the 1988 period. 
The firm said 1988 full-year and fourth-quarter results included a gain from 
the sale of its Kendall health-care unit and a charge related to Hill's Pet 
Products. Excluding those, Colgate-Palmolive said, net income rose 19% for the 
year and 43% for the quarter.

Tenneco Inc.: The Houston-based company said 1989 net income was $584 million, 
down from $822 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The company noted that 1988 income reflected $823 million from discontinued 
operations, primarily profit on the sale of Tenneco Oil Co. Without the 
one-time gain, the company posted a $1-million loss from continuing operations 
in 1988. Revenue was $14.1 billion for 1989, compared to $13.2 billion for 
1988. The significant improvement in 1989 results was led by the strong 
performance in the farm and construction equipment business and improvements in 
natural gas pipeline operations, the company said.

New York Times Co.: The media concern lost $19 million in the fourth quarter, 
contrasted with earnings of $50 million in the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose 4% to $470 million. For 1989, net income jumped 59% from 1988 to a 
record $267 million, principally because of a $193-million gain on the sale of 
its cable television system. Revenue totaled $1.8 billion, up 4%. The results 
were attributed to regional economic weakness and previously disclosed charges 
involving its forest products investment, costs of voluntary staffing 
reductions at the Times, costs associated with its recent acquisitions of 
McCall's, Golf World (U.S.) and Sailing World magazines and a legal settlement 
with independent home delivery dealers.

The Fashion Industry Friends of AIDS Project Los Angeles have been scurrying 
around town begging and borrowing memorable movie costumes for their Feb. 23 
benefit, "Fashion in Film -- the Hollywood Years." As a result, Scarlett's 
barbecue dress, Jezebel's red satin ball gown, and Cleopatra's column of gold, 
circa 1960, will all be on the runway that night, as will other originals by 
Hollywood's legendary costumers -- Adrian, Edith Head and Jean Louis included. 
Unfortunately, some of the greats got away. Audrey Hepburn's Ascot gown from 
"My Fair Lady," stored in a plastic garbage bag in Baltimore, got pitched out 
with the trash, explains costumer Donfeld, a consultant on the show. All the 
more reason to see the treasures that have been unearthed intact. For ticket 
information, call (213) 962-1600, Ext. 286.

MADONNA SIGHTING: On a recent Friday night at Club Louie, Madonna joined the 
fashion crowd for a little dancing. Herb Ritts and Matthew Rolston were in 
attendance as she jumped on the banquettes to do her solo go-go number. Doffing 
her blouse to beat the heat she spent the rest of the evening wearing only her 
black bra and mini skirt. Escort Warren Beatty spent his time looking bored and 
jowly, sitting in the corner.

NEW FOR NECKS: The neck ornament for the new decade, joining the likes of peace 
signs, ankhs and gold chains, may very well be the "1990 World." It's the 
newest way to say "Have I shown the pictures of my grandchildren?" The sterling 
silver orb opens to reveal an accordion of photo frames. The necklace was 
conceived by Los Angeles jewelry designer Christina Solomon and comedian Jamie 
Monroe. Bob Hope and Aaron Spelling have bought them and Monroe says Cher is 
wearing one on her "Heart of Stone" album cover. They can be purchased by mere 
mortals for $90 at Bullock's.

Q: I will be getting married in March at a simple ceremony with only close 
friends and immediate family in attendance. As this will be a second wedding 
for me, I was thinking of wearing a suit. 
</P>
<P>
What do you recommend for someone 36, 5'6", Size 10? -- S.E. 
</P>
<P>
A: How about a lace jacket with a chiffon skirt, as illustrated here? This 
romantic suit is by Susan Lane, bridal gown designer and owner of Country 
Elegance, who suggests that you buy the jacket in ivory lace over rose-beige 
satin and the skirt in blush pink, a shade lighter than rose-beige. Lane says 
that blush pink is the No. 1 color for all wedding gowns sold at her shop, 
replacing white and antique ivory. She believes it's especially appropriate for 
what she calls encore brides. This suit, priced at $450, comes in Sizes 6-16 at 
Country Elegance, 7375 Greenbush Ave., North Hollywood, Calif. 91605.

Surfing's elite met at the movies over the weekend and, of course, the movie 
was about their favorite sport. "Surfers" is the $400,000 brainchild of Michael 
Tomson, the president of Gotcha Sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
His company and Surfer magazine sponsored the San Diego preview of the film, 
which will be in theaters in April. He got the idea while watching the "Rolling 
Stone -- 20 Years of Rock 'n' Roll" television special in 1987. The fashion 
look was generic this night. Surfers wore their usual ethnic threads and sea 
jewelry -- objects from the beach, tied to silk cords. Adventure-film makers 
dressed like Indiana Jones in plaid shirts and leather bomber jackets. Orange 
County hipsters wore jeans with stylish black blazers. The rowdy crowd, many of 
whom were surf-industry stars, hooted their way through some of Tomson's 
introductory remarks. Once the film started, however, the catcalls turned to 
cheers and, at the end, loud applause. It may be another Endless Summer after 
all. NEIL FEINEMAN

The big event was the fifth race at Santa Anita when Bill Shoemaker made "The 
Legend's Last Ride." A crowd of 64,573 well-wishers packed themselves into the 
stands, T-shirts pressing T-shirts at rail side. 
</P>
<P>
High above the sweaty masses in the elevated environs of the private Turf Club, 
the blue-bloods were gathering for Shoemaker's swan song. But they weren't 
sweating, not even in their suits and ties and full-length furs. They remained 
cool in their bespoke Oxxford suits and unruffled in their Chanel coat dresses. 
Even the turf tykes were turned out to a tee in suits, ties and suede shoes. It 
was such a nice looking crowd, so well dressed, so well mannered. Not a bead of 
perspiration was shed when Shoemaker lost his race. As the nether crowd roared, 
whistled and wiped their teary eyes, the bloods applauded politely and turned 
the pages of their racing forms to the sixth race. The sport of kings had lost 
a prince. Long live the sport of kings. GAILE ROBINSON

MORNING REPORT: JACKSON CHALLENGING ABDUL FOR NO. 1

Abdul vs. Jackson: the battle of dance-music divas is hotter than ever. Though 
Paula Abdul continues to lead both Billboard pop charts with her album, 
"Forever Your Girl" and her single, 'Opposites Attract," she's appears likely 
to surrender both No. 1 positions to rival Janet Jackson in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's "Escapade" single rocketed up six notches to No. 3 and could be No. 1 
next week. Her single is likely to propel her "Rhythm Nation" album into the 
top spot. But don't be surprised if Milli Vanilli's album, "Girl You Know it's 
True," (No. 2) sneaks back into No.1 in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
* Country singer Ricky Van Shelton, whose "RVS III" -- already a country chart 
hit -- is making a big splash on the pop album charts, jumping from No. 71 to 
No. 54. Maybe he's finally ready to challenge Randy Travis.

Idol Update: Rock star Billy Idol is scheduled for additional surgery Saturday 
to repair his right leg, severely broken in a Tuesday motorcycle accident in 
Hollywood, his publicist said. However, Chrysalis Records has said it will go 
ahead with the scheduled April 17 release of Idol's just completed "Charmed 
Life" album, with the single "Cradle of Love" to be issued April 10, though a 
planned 1990 concert tour is in doubt. Meanwhile, director Oliver Stone 
released a statement Thursday that he still wants Idol to co-star in his film 
biography of the late Jim Morrison, scheduled to begin shooting in early March, 
but may have to recast if Idol's recovery takes too long. BETH KLEID

Hearing on Hammer Museum Money Set: A Delaware judge has scheduled an April 4 
hearing on a proposed settlement of shareholder litigation against Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. that challenges the use of Occidental money to finance the 
Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center. The lawsuit involved is one of 
two pending shareholder actions that seek to block plans for the museum, which 
is under construction in Westwood.

In a second shareholder suit, New York investor Alan R. Kahn has opposed the 
settlement proposal. The California Public Employees Retirement System, the 
state's largest pension plan, is also petitioning to enter the case. Delaware 
Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett is expected to hear arguments at the hearing 
in Wilmington on the settlement proposal. BETH KLEID

Dupond to Head Paris Ballet: Rudolf Nureyev's stormy six-year stint at the 
Paris Opera Ballet ended Thursday when rising French star Patrick Dupond, 30, 
was named to succeed him as the troupe's new dance director. 
</P>
<P>
But a bitter dispute over the copyright and control of the ballets that 
Soviet-born Nureyev choreographed for the opera house is only just beginning, 
Pierre Berge, chairman of the Paris Opera, said. Nureyev was eased out as head 
of the Paris ballet last year, but he stayed on as chief choreographer while 
Berge searched for a successor. French Culture Minister Jack Lang said that 
Dupond's three-year contract stipulated at least 20 dance performances each 
season. BETH KLEID

BRAIDING STRANDS OF CHARM, CRUELTY IN DRAMATIC 'GYPSIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the singular world of Yugoslav director Emir Kusturica, brides float in the 
air, houses levitate and knives find their victims telekinetically. In the 
world of his Yugoslav Gypsies, brides are for stealing, friends for swindling, 
strangers for victimizing and children are to be bought and sold like bags of 
onions. 
</P>
<P>
Braid these strands together and you have "Time of the Gypsies" (at the AMC 
Century 14), a turbulent, mesmerizing contemporary melodrama about the undoing 
of innocence. Wildly ambitious, it's nearly as disorderly and spontaneous and 
irrepressible as its Gypsies themselves, and at times as manipulative. No 
matter; the sleight-of-hand holds, keeping us fascinated if not enchanted by 
the life and hard times of its ill-starred young hero. 
</P>
<P>
It's painful to watch naive young Perhan acquire a lifetime's worth of mistrust 
and venality in a few years. If you follow Kusturica's thesis, though, it's an 
unavoidable pattern. His film is bracketed front and back with wailing brides, 
one howling because her husband of less than 24 hours is paralytically drunk, 
the other screaming murderously because her husband of less than an hour has 
been stabbed to death. Cycles within cycles, Kusturica suggests, unalterable as 
the tides. The final cycle will be played out by a 4-year-old child at the very 
end of the film, leaving no doubt that this Gypsy mythology will keep repeating 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
At the opening, Kusturica, who co-wrote the screenplay with Gordan Mihic , 
drops us off inside the ramshackle house of a Gypsy grandmother, and we're not 
outside this eccentric society until two hours and 20 minutes later. It has the 
dislocation of "Through the Looking Glass." 
</P>
<P>
The house is Perhan's grandmother's, a healer, She's raised Perhan and his 
little sister Danira by her own honorable rules, which already sets them apart 
from 98% of their village. Perhan is an idealistic, hilariously ugly teen-ager 
who turns almost beautiful as we get to know him. 
</P>
<P>
He already has a sweetheart, Azra, who has inked his name under her breast and 
to whom he is pledged. But at least in his younger moments, it's possible that 
he's equally fond of his enormous turkey, his one constant companion. (Davor 
Dujmovic, who plays the range of Perhan's experience with such depths, is one 
of the exceptions in this largely nonprofessional cast. He has virtually grown 
up under Kusturica's lenses, since he played one of the two sons in the 
director's prize-winning "When Father Was Away on Business" four years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
When Ahmed, the richest man in their community, volunteers to pay for medical 
attention for Danira's crippled leg, brother and sister leave in his overloaded 
car, bound for the hospital. Unsurprisingly, this offer from a man gleaming 
with brilliantine and gold chains is not on the up-and-up. Brother and sister 
are separated and, although Perhan never stops looking for Danira, he drops 
with astonishing speed into a life of worldliness and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
It's an unbearably vicious world. Making sorties back and forth into Italy, 
Ahmed and his band keep a retinue of pregnant women and young children virtual 
slaves, turning them out on the streets each morning to beg and shaking them 
down every night. The leadership of the gang passes back and forth, more 
violently each time. (Bora Todorovic, the film and theater professional who 
plays Ahmed, does so with charm layering his cruelty.) 
</P>
<P>
But as he spins this morbid chapter, Kusturica's imagination lavishes the scene 
with dreams that might have wafted from South American magic realism, a 
literature he is steeped in. Bridal veils waft by significantly, a baby is 
delivered from a mother floating horizontally like a magician's assistant, even 
a gas pump seems like a magic totem. 
</P>
<P>
Perhan returns home only near the end of his odyssey, after his experiences 
have made him closed and cynical. In one of the film's most haunting moments, 
his grandmother asks why he won't believe the truth even when it's said by 
those closest to him. The answer is poignant, the crux of Gypsy credo: "Since I 
started lying myself, I don't believe anything." 
</P>
<P>
"Time of the Gypsies" (rated R for its violence, nudity and adult themes) is a 
sprawling, hallucinatory experience, with gleefully naturalistic performances 
by all its enormous cast. Since it's virtually impossible to pick out the few 
professionals involved, praise should be lavished on Kusturica or his Gypsies 
or both. Both seems only fair, with a particularly deep bow to Ljubica 
Adzovic's principled grandmother.

AN ODDBALL ODYSSEY IN 'HOMER AND EDDIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Andrei Konchalovsky's "Homer and Eddie" (at the Cineplex Odeon, Century 
City), a brain-damaged man and an escaped mental patient pair up on a 
cross-country jaunt. I suppose a great movie could be made from this premise. 
Given the right combination of talents, a great movie could probably be made 
from any premise. Not this time, though. The story is booby-trapped, and the 
film makers leave no trap untripped. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Belushi plays Homer, who was hit in the head with a baseball when he was a 
child. He lives alone in Arizona, where he works as a dishwasher, and hasn't 
seen his parents in 20 years. He sets out to visit them in Oregon. Eddie, 
played by Whoopi Goldberg, is on the run from a mental institution when she 
comes upon the hapless Homer. Together, they make their way in Eddie's junker 
across a symbolic American wasteland, stopping off periodically to accumulate 
life lessons. 
</P>
<P>
The main lesson they learn is tolerance for each other's differences. Isn't it 
about time to refresh this misfits-on-the-road genre? (Things have gone way 
downhill since "La Strada," from which this film lifts liberally.) How about a 
movie featuring two people thrown together by circumstance who grow to hate 
each other? The subject matter of "Homer and Eddie," which has been in the can 
for over a year, is so close to satire that you regret the decision to play it 
straight. Particularly since Belushi and Goldberg are more adept at comedy than 
all this cornball squishiness. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the squishiness so particularly repellent is that Eddie, aside from 
being a mental patient, also has an inoperable brain tumor. She has one month 
to live, and so apparently she feels justified in murdering whoever gets in her 
way. She pulls off several convenience-store killings in the R-rated "Homer and 
Eddie," and still the film makers try to palm her off as a poor soul. They 
carry "understanding" to lunatic extremes. When Eddie kills in order to get the 
money to pay for Homer's deflowering at a Nevada brothel, you know you're 
squarely in the hands of film makers every bit as nutty as their characters.

'LOOSE CANNONS' NEEDS LOTS OF TIGHTENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Loose Cannons" (citywide) is yet another mismatched buddy-buddy cop movie. 
Even though director-co-writer Bob Clark has a bright, genial style, there's a 
foredoomed feel about it all. Gene Hackman is the tough, irreverent old pro, 
Dan Aykroyd is his overly sensitive, on-the-edge partner and, once again, they 
battle their way through a screaming maze of psycho criminals, car-chases and 
wisecracks to find happiness. 
</P>
<P>
As a buddy couple, Hackman and Aykroyd are not bad. Hackman's shaggy realism 
rubs up nicely against Aykroyd's nervous artifice, and they get some nice, 
relaxed badinage together. But the movie is like another race at the dog track, 
with the script as the mechanical rabbit. The writers, Clark and the father-son 
team of Richard and Richard Christian Matheson, must feel people are tired of 
drug czars. Here, their villains are Nazis, and the Macguffin at first seems to 
be a porno movie involving Hitler. Since Dom DeLuise is also in the cast -- as 
Gutterman, an S&amp;M impresario -- you might imagine Mel Brooks lurking behind 
this somewhere. No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
The main gimmick is built around Aykroyd's virtuoso mimicry. His character, 
Ellis Fielding, suffers from a personality disorder that makes him break out, 
under stress, into multiple TV and movie star impressions -- as if Rich Little 
were playing "The Three Faces of Eve." At odd moments, Fielding becomes Popeye 
the Sailor, The Roadrunner, Dirty Harry, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and 
most of the casts of "The Wizard of Oz" and "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
The movie keeps dropping its own balls. Fielding is introduced as a Sherlock 
Holmes-style deductive whiz, a quality that never resurfaces for the rest of 
the movie. Instead, we get the "Odd Couple" with "Lethal Weapons." Prissy 
Fielding has just emerged from a Benedictine monastery with monk psychiatrists 
and he lives in a white-on-white apartment with tapes of beach sounds. Slob Mac 
has just had his apartment burned down and he lives in his station wagon, with 
his possessions, his cat and a leaky bag of cat litter. Instead of parking this 
mess somewhere, he goes on duty with his possessions strapped to the roof, even 
getting into high speed chases with them. 
</P>
<P>
So there we are: crazed Nazis fighting odd-couple cops, one of whom suffers 
from TV schizophrenia. The FBI gets into the tangle too, along with the Israeli 
Secret Service, led by Riva (Nancy Travis) a Cosmo cover-girl type in an partly 
unbuttoned blouse. 
</P>
<P>
There are moments when Aykroyd goes into one of his impressionist attacks, or 
when Hackman looks around him with one of his crinkled "Can you believe this?" 
grins and you realize how good they both can be. But, despite them, "Loose 
Cannons" (MPAA rated R, for violence and language) is a movie without ideas, 
armament without much ammunition. Like most Buddy-buddy cop movies it plays 
like Sisyphus and his rock; crashing back down the hill almost before you can 
roll it up.

'LOBSTER' LAUNCHES MIDNIGHT FILM POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With "Lobster Man From Mars," the Royal Theater, long noted for its 
distinguished programming, this weekend launches a new Saturday midnight-movie 
policy with a winner. 
</P>
<P>
Director Stanley Sheff and the late writer Bob Greenberg have lovingly sent up 
the tacky '50s sci-fi/horror drive-in flick with the help of a good cast that 
gets into the spirit of the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Mars is fast running out of air, and the hideous Lobster Man (S. 
D. Nemeth) is dispatched by the King of Mars (Bobby (Boris) Pickett of "Monster 
Mash" fame) to Earth to steal its air. (Never mind how he's supposed to manage 
it). In any event, the Lobster Man menaces a nice young couple (Deborah 
Foreman, Anthony Hickox), and Hickox's scientist uncle (ever-stalwart Patrick 
Macnee) gets into the act. So does a weird psychic, played by Billy Barty, and 
Tommy Sledge, who as a vintage private eye wrote his own dialogue, a veritable 
dictionary of dated, hard-boiled detective slang. (He even carries around his 
own taped film noir theme music.) Dr. Demento narrates the film. 
</P>
<P>
Making a virtue of the presumed necessity of a minuscule budget, Sheff and 
Greenberg have no end of fun with cheap special effects and familiar outdoor 
locales (e.g., Malibu Canyon, much used by Roger Corman). Carrying off such a 
picture is not as easy as it seems: A good parody of bad genre pictures 
requires more than a passing acquaintance with such films, which are already 
self-parodies. It is also a challenge to sustain and control such spoofery, and 
Sheff uses a film-within-a-film device that masks both budget limitations and 
allows him a breather from the tongue-in-cheek stuff. 
</P>
<P>
This framing story has a nerdy fledgling director (Dean Jacobson), who looks to 
be still in his teens, showing his magnum opus, "Lobster Man From Mars," to a 
slick Hollywood producer (Tony Curtis, in top form) in desperate need of a 
terrible picture to release for tax reasons. From time to time Sheff cuts to 
Curtis, who ad-libs a series of amusing reactions to the film. "Lobster Man 
From Mars" (rated PG) is an instance where cornball antics has required 
considerable sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Sheff has set off his film with the perfect curtain raiser, "Kimbar," which is 
Chapter 1 of an old serial so bad that Chapter 2 was never made! A hilariously 
tacky rip-off of Tarzan, it stars bodybuilder Steve Reeves as the loin-clothed 
King of the Jungle. To complete the program, Sheff has a couple of laughable 
vintage house trailers, one a severe admonition -- i.e., banishment for life -- 
against talking during the movie and the other the offer of a six-month pass to 
anyone who reports vandalism of theater seats.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: IT'S A NEW BUT FAMILIAR BISTRO GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man at the next table leans over. "Would you believe," he asks, "that I'm 
83 years old?" He gestures grandly around the room, taking in the high 
ceilings, the well-trained waiters, the woman at the next table in her sequined 
gown. 
</P>
<P>
"And I believe in living well. After all, you can't take your money with you. 
I'm so glad that they've finally opened this restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Bistro Garden at Coldwater, 12950 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, 
(818) 501-0202, may be a brand new restaurant, but it doesn't feel like one. It 
is as familiar as an old tuxedo. People walking into the room greet the maitre 
d' with affection, wave happily at friends as they walk to their tables, hardly 
bother to look at the menu. "Oh," says the man at the next table, "the food 
here is very good. Have the shrimp cocktail. They serve a great steak. Be sure 
to order a chocolate souffle for dessert." He himself orders a cognac and 
settles into his chair. "We used to have to go over the hill to eat," he muses, 
"and I'm so tired of driving." 
</P>
<P>
The man at the next table watches our salads arrive at the table. (The celery 
root is wonderful.) "You know," he says after a while, "before this we didn't 
have any restaurants over here. We got the Sportsman's Lodge, but that's just a 
place to get a sandwich. We got La Serre, but I go there for the Rotary and I'm 
sick of it. This, this is a restaurant."

STAGE BEAT: AN AMUSING TAKE ON FLAG BURNING BY THE ZETA COLLECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is it now? Burn a flag, go to jail? To some, that sounds reasonable. To 
others, that sounds like latent totalitarianism. It's also a little bit funny, 
as most things are when you think about them long enough. Mime artist William 
Fisher has thought about flag burning, and the result is an amusing piece, 
"Ready? Begin!," the better half of the Zeta Collective's "Half Life Bis" at 
the Zeta Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's man is a lonely figure buffeted by the winds of patriotism and gusts 
of blowhard rhetoric projected through the boom box of mass media. (Bush and 
Reagan are heard on the sometimes muddy sound track, and so is a 
gentle-sounding German voice -- Hitler's "Mein Kampf.") He is twisted, pulled, 
tugged and cajoled, and it's no surprise that he gives in to join the army. 
Besides being a fine display of corporeal mime influenced by Etienne Decroux 
and made doubly fine by Ellen Schimmel's music, "Ready? Begin!" tells a story 
with a comic accent and ends on a funny, chilling image. 
</P>
<P>
The startling aspect of the second piece, "Crowd Work" by Paul Jones, is seeing 
performer Fanny de Sousa appear as Jones' proper City of London man. It works 
because this corporate soldier is having a major problem with enlarging breasts 
-- tumescences, as he calls them. An apt term, because he's a clinical fellow 
who gives an account of his problems as if they were someone else's. 
</P>
<P>
But once the shock wears off, the piece itself becomes clinical (director 
Fisher pushes this approach by placing a transparent scrim between us and De 
Sousa). Jones' writing never gets below the fascinating surface, and De Sousa's 
success with the role is strictly technical -- the male behavior tics, for 
instance, are dead on. This is an anatomy of a body, not a person. 
</P>
<P>
 At 929 East 2nd St., on Saturdays, 8:30 p.m., through Feb. 24. Tickets: $10; 
(213) 617-8259. 
</P>
<P>
Scattershot 'Riding Club' at West Coast Ensemble 
</P>
<P>
Plays that try to please everyone usually end up pleasing no one. In Avner 
Garbi's production at West Coast Ensemble, Kerry Kennedy's "The Riding Club" 
wants to be, simultaneously, a light sitcom, a New Age meta-tale, a Southern 
comedy of manners and a feel-good morality story. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the route to dramatic success, unless you have a first-class 
imagination. Kennedy doesn't show it here, and her attempts at crowd-pleasing 
cancel out each other, all at the service of a pat moral: Life is here to be 
lived, so live it. She prods and manipulates her five female characters -- 
chummy in school, now atomized in their '30s -- so they fit the message. The 
puppet strings show. 
</P>
<P>
The terminally ill Addy (Cynthia Steele), for example, is too blatantly the 
symbol of human sacrifice as she leaves the hospital for a more spiritual 
death. Her pal Christmas (Jeanine Jackson) is too obviously the voice of 
flawed, likable Everywoman. Mary Louise (Nancy Boykin) is too stolidly the 
Bourgeois Wife -- even her human slips feel manipulated. Jan Sheldrick's Bobby 
Joe and Lisa Denke's Patty Lynn are too clearly puppets in Kennedy's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The actresses can't escape this aura of manipulation, though they're all good 
at playing types. Types, though, are for TV; Kennedy is a young playwright, and 
she needs to let her characters dictate their own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; 
until Feb. 25. Tickets: $12.50; (213) 871-1052.

<P>
Afro-American Musical at Inglewood Civic 
</P>
<P>
Poet Robert Bly has talked about the need for boys and men to develop relations 
with male mentors. The lack of them in African-American communities, for 
example, is a cause for the gang culture. Writer-director Cepheus Jaxon has 
this in mind with his musical history, "The African American," at Inglewood 
Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly man on the bus bench whips some young punks into shape by telling 
them the story of how African people, forced into slavery across the ocean, 
have been fighting their way to freedom ever since. It's a hackneyed narrative 
conceit on which to hang two acts worth of musical numbers. Some hang better 
than others. 
</P>
<P>
The African sections (especially the artful slave ship sequence), along with 
those in the city and during the Roaring '20s, crackle and buzz because of 
Jaxon's hugely energetic ensemble. In the singing and dancing departments, 
involvement rules over precision: The heat is on, while the pacing is cold. 
"The African American" is best as an entertaining history lesson for the young, 
so the chapters not in the show -- Marcus Garvey's pan-Africanism, civil rights 
battles in the '50s and Malcolm X, for example -- are glaring by their absence.

Send-Up of Male Paranoia at L.A. Art Theatre 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, Carl Miller's "The Feminists" looks like a speculative fiction 
playing off of every male sexist's nightmare: Feminist militants take over the 
country, ban recreational sex and force men into slavery or prison. 
</P>
<P>
The whole business, though, amounts to nothing more than a hopped-up, R-rated, 
ultra-tongue-in-cheek send-up in the tradition of "Saturday Night Live." You 
see, the narrator (a mock-stentorian Marcus Smythe) confesses to being the 
"author": We're to view "The Feminists" as the fantasy of a paranoid male mind. 
</P>
<P>
It's all fairly mindless, in fact. In Charles Randolph Wright's cast at Los 
Angeles Art Theatre, only Paul Satterfield's suitably blank super-hero and 
Eileen T'Kaye's cackling henchwoman have the nerve to play their roles to the 
needed extreme. Junk-food theater like this should work at least as a guilty 
pleasure. The only pleasing thing about "The Feminists" is that it's over in an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11305 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8:30 
p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; indefinitely. Tickets: $9.99; (818) 763-3101. 
</P>
<P>
Word-Tripping at Alliance's 'Jump Camp' 
</P>
<P>
Larry Blamire's "Jump Camp" exudes promise, from the setting -- a desert ghost 
town where an author and her agent are searching out a reclusive intellectual 
-- to character names indebted to Thomas Pynchon: Royd Vaugus, Axel Ten Eyck, 
Bathsheba Mae Dorn, Finney Stickes. 
</P>
<P>
At the Alliance Theatre under Dean Coleman's direction, though, the bad signs 
come early and often: The banter between Peter Fox's agent and Petrea 
Burchard's author is deep in sitcom land, and the couple's subsequent encounter 
with the town's citizens becomes Blamire's indulgent exercise in linguistic 
doodling. 
</P>
<P>
His plot turns (which we won't reveal) posit a reason for the dialogue spew, 
which nevertheless doesn't excuse it. "Jump Camp" devolves into an 
extraordinary imposition on the listener, since its pointless narrative 
contortions and word-tripping become a choke-hold on both our imagination and 
the cast's ability to enliven the absurdist goings-on. Choked, too, is 
Blamire's point -- that brilliant minds, left unchecked, can cause havoc. A 
good point for word-loving playwrights to keep in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3204 Magnolia Blvd., Burbank, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., until 
March 11. Tickets: $12; (818) 566-7935. 
</P>
<P>
A Strange 'Bird' at the Coronet 
</P>
<P>
The Coronet Theatre used to house distinguished plays. Now it houses something 
billed as a "theatography" titled "Bird of Passage." Never mind that it doesn't 
fly. We're talking crash and burn. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see if we have this right. Manju (Tom Ashworth) is the inventor of an 
"organic computer" named Interim. On the other hand, Manju denies that he's a 
scientist. He applies for a development grant to "The Council," a black-clad 
quintet of rulers (what they rule is unclear). They turn him down, his wife 
leaves him for Manju's buddy, and then the Council gets nasty. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a high school show mixing video, science fiction and ballet, on a 
budget, and you might get the idea. Interim is depicted in 
director-choreographer Zina Bethune's staging as four little ballerinas, 
dressed in leotards with glowing lights. 
</P>
<P>
Playing time is largely consumed with one derivative pas de deux after another. 
It's a painfully saving grace, since the cast can't muster one convincing line 
delivery. On the other hand, co-authors Linda Pace and Bethune can't muster a 
convincing line. The council chants, "Itemize! Categorize! Specify!" Manju 
visits his buddy and says, "I came to see you, 'cause I came to see you." 
Manju's wife tells him, "Interim may be the future, but I need you now." 
</P>
<P>
We don't need this. 
</P>
<P>
 At 366 N. La Cienega Blvd., tonight and Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 3:30 and 
7:30 p.m. Tickets: $18; (213) 659-2400.

Found Art Trio: Tom Hartman, Leonard Seagal and Daniel Wheeler are three local 
young sculptors who share a gift for making mundane found objects intriguing. 
Hartman is the stand-up comedian of the group. 
</P>
<P>
His jokey pieces reduce art and art making to self-parodying tools of the 
trade. He constructs a swirling spiral from red plastic screw anchors pounded 
into the wall or empty picture frames that are simply four carpenter's levels 
neatly interlocked. The craft is deft but the objects too quickly become a 
series of smart one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Seagal puts luggage on wheels and stacks gray rocks in it. There are metal 
forms held by cables that take a good-natured approach to the mysterious. 
Playfulness enlivens the pieces -- particularly "Pico Pica," a strange 
installation of three empty "shells" mounted in front of a stylized painting of 
a flaming wall. It would delight any hot-rod aficionado. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler's sculptures and installation prove the most involving. He uses old 
pails, whisk brushes, bent rods and wooden stools in a search for clues to the 
teetering experience of being human. The works have a quasi-religious quality. 
"Ecce Homo," a tormented and seductive installation, seems to marry a voting 
booth to a confessional. The smart, sensitive piece asks troubling questions 
about personal vulnerability and social responsibility. (Glenn Dash Gallery, 
962 N. La Brea Ave., to March 17.) SUVAN GEER

Lowlander in the Highlands: Born and schooled in the Netherlands, Rudi 
Verhoeven now lives and works in New Mexico. A first L.A. show includes a group 
of interesting and well appointed abstract constructions that pull together 
everything from lush paint to bits of paper-thin metal and sail cloth to make 
seductive, rough-hewn surfaces 
</P>
<P>
He inscribes all manner of dexterous calligraphic marks that start to look like 
arcane emblems with meanings we're not privy to. 
</P>
<P>
He is at his best when his graceful draftsmanship isn't overwhelmed by 
smoldering finishes. "In the Rift" features an upper and lower band of layered 
color, each robust swath of hue both obliterating and enhancing the one beneath 
it. Peeking through this are random, loosely painted patterns so sketchy that 
they resemble chair caning or wall paper seen through the drippy, vaporous haze 
of a moist shower door. In the middle register, rendered over a chalky white 
ground, Verhoeven paints an enormous lobed pod that suggests a giant spore, a 
weapon or a distant relative to the Goodyear blimp. (Tokoro Gallery, 320 N. 
Robertson Blvd. to Feb. 28.) MARLENA DONOHUE

NOSTALGIA OF YESTERYEAR RETURNS IN 'THE BRADYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Come with us now to the days of yesteryear as "The Brady Bunch" returns from 
sitcom limbo. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bradys" returns at 8 tonight with a two-hour movie (Channels 2 and 8) that 
will be followed in succeeding weeks by hourlong installments. 
</P>
<P>
It reunites all but one of the cast from the original 1969-74 series. 
</P>
<P>
And gee, don't they look good? But what's all this relevancy stuff? 
</P>
<P>
Jan (Eve Plumb) wants a baby, so she and husband Philip (Ron Kuhlman) spend 
their time leaping into bed. Peter (Christopher Knight) has just broken off his 
fourth engagement. Greg (Barry Williams) is an obstetrician married to his 
nurse (Caryn Richman). Little Cindy (Susan Olsen -- with the pigtails, 
remember?) is a rock 'n' roll deejay. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia, played by Leah Ayres (replacing Maureen McCormick from the original 
cast), has two kids and is married to out-of-work Wally (Jerry Hauser). They've 
all moved in with Mom and Dad. Mom (Florence Henderson) is now a successful 
real-estate agent and Dad (Robert Reed) is still a successful architect. And 
yes, Ann B. Davis is back as Alice, the housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
It's Bobby (Michael Lookinland) around whom the action revolves. About to 
triumph as a professional race car driver, he crashes and is paralyzed, perhaps 
for life. But he's got an old girlfriend (Martha Quinn) waiting in the wings if 
he can just swallow his pride. 
</P>
<P>
Don't worry, though. Relevancy may have been the intention, but director Bruce 
Bilson sticks to '70s-sitcom actions and reactions with a masterful disregard 
for dramatic context. 
</P>
<P>
He's aided and abetted by writers Sherwood Schwartz and Lloyd J. Schwartz, who 
go for nostalgia with the same simplistic dialogue and contrived, sweet 
situations we remember from the old days. LYNNE HEFFLEY

BREAKFAST: BERKELEY OR TRUCK-STOP STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choosing a breakfast place for out-of-town visitors isn't easy. You could try 
making a big impression at a first-class hotel, but that sort of generic luxury 
doesn't really convey the essence of Southern California living. Cafe Zinc and 
Belisle's do. Yet they couldn't possibly have less in common. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Zinc in Laguna Beach has no real competition that I know about. It's a 
Berkeley-style hangout, the closest thing to Alice Waters' Cafe Fanny in this 
part of the state, and almost European in its casualness. I'd eat there every 
morning if it was convenient. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tiny, free-standing building with a cramped, plant-filled outdoor patio. 
Local residents keep the place jammed, so be prepared to read the paper or feed 
the pigeons while you wait for a table. 
</P>
<P>
You stand in line until you get to the zinc-topped counter where you order some 
of the best muffins, fresh juices and breakfast treats this side of Shattuck 
Avenue in Berkeley. You can take your breakfast to one of the indoor tables 
where a Vivaldi concerto might accompany your meal, but I prefer the patio, 
really a short course in Laguna Beach life style. Athletic men in Shimano 
jerseys discuss the latest advances in bike-frame technology. Sharp-eyed women 
sketch with charcoal as they sip on lattes and mochas. You almost forget to 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a remarkable bowl of cappuccino, intensely flavored with foam dense 
enough to carve your initials in. Millet muffins, with tiny crunchy pearls of 
the grain providing New-Age texture, have a sweet, seductive aftertaste 
reminiscent of farmhouse corn bread. Wonderfully springy cranberry muffins 
burst with the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycle-touring crowd favors the complex carbos. Breakfast wheat with dried 
fruit and steamed milk is the austere path; a heady granola made from almonds, 
oats, sesame seed, orange rind and brown sugar is the indulgent one. For the 
more traditional, there are good poached or boiled farm eggs served with 
sourdough toast. For the European set there are frittatas -- Italian versions 
of quiche without the crust. I sampled one with asparagus, sun-dried tomato and 
red pepper. It tasted moist and fresh. 
</P>
<P>
All Cafe Zinc pastries are made on the premises, with the exception of the 
sugar-crusted cinnamon twists (which is uncharacteristically sweet for this 
crowd). Juices are always fresh. If you bicycle over, you may want to cool off 
with a Zinc cooler, a yogurt drink with crushed pineapple and crystallized 
ginger. It's a great refreshment. 
</P>
<P>
A world away from the Zinc is Belisle's in Garden Grove, one mile south of 
Disneyland. It's been around since 1955, and I'd say this restaurant, along 
with the food it serves, is ready to be bronzed and put into a museum. It's 
definitely the first place I'd take a visiting sumo wrestler, and I'm told that 
members of the Rams, Angels and Dodgers like to drop by whenever they are 
working the Big A. Good morning, y'all. 
</P>
<P>
You get the message as soon as you walk through the door. Eye-popping, frosted 
cinnamon rolls at least five times the normal size, and towering pies and cakes 
in glass cases make an immediate impression. I'll never forget watching a 
Swedish tourist, cinnamon roll held firmly in her two hands, staring at it in 
awe as if she had found the Holy Grail. She never did bite into it. 
</P>
<P>
Eating breakfast here is straight from a chapter of Gulliver's Travels. Food is 
served on giant platters that must weigh five pounds apiece. Beverages come in 
32-ounce glasses. The selection is mostly giant portions of American truck-stop 
fare: grits, biscuits, corn bread, and the usual egg and meat dishes. Does any 
of it taste good? Well, better than you might think. 
</P>
<P>
Pulpy fresh grapefruit juice, served in a boot-shaped glass, is cold and 
astringent. I like it better than the orange juice, which is also 
fresh-squeezed. Omelets (made with four eggs) are good, too, especially the 
Denver. And the breakfast meats -- thick country bacon, outsized sausage links, 
generous portions of ham -- cannot be faulted. Stray beyond that, however, and 
you are really pushing your luck. 
</P>
<P>
Something that may never take America by storm is Belisle's "southern-fried 
mush," which tastes vaguely like polenta. It comes in foot-long slabs, four to 
an order. 
</P>
<P>
Doughy biscuits taste of baking powder and little else. The house chicken-fried 
steak is an overcooked expanse of tenderized beef with a peel-off breading and 
some gluey cream gravy underneath. Hot cakes and waffles are huge and 
innocuous. Smear them with the cloying honey butter, or smother them with 
sorghum syrup sold in bottles by the door. Serious eaters will want to know 
about the 26-ounce steak included in the Texas breakfast. Unless you are a 
lineman or an anthropologist, I wouldn't recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Zinc is inexpensive. Coffees are 80 cents to $1.75. Pastries and muffins 
are $1.45. Egg dishes are $2.75 to $3.75. 
</P>
<P>
Belisle's is moderately priced, but the prices can be misleading because some 
of big-ticket items can feed an entire family. Breads are $1.45 to $6.25. 
Omelets are $9.95 to $14.45. Super breakfasts are $23.95. Beverages are 80 
cents to $1.75. Lunch and dinner are similarly priced.

These are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
La Palma Chicken Pie Shop and Restaurant, 928 N. Euclid Ave., Anaheim. (714) 
533-2021. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Bakery 
opens at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where you want to go for meat loaf, pan fried chicken and the other 
kinds of tried and true, roadside American fare that are creeping back onto the 
menus in more upscale establishments. The signature dish, chicken pie, is a 
buttery, 9 oz. disc crammed with shredded meat. At $1.95 it makes a great, 
affordable snack. Don't bypass the attached bakery, where the goodies include 
peach pie, burnt almond cake and a rich house cheesecake, and an excellent, 
springy chocolate cake is only three dollars. 
</P>
<P>
* Greek Cuisine, 13011 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 731-1179. Open Mondays 
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Sundays through Thursdays from 5 to 10, 
Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
Flamingo, 17185 Brookhurst, Fountain Valley. Open Tuesdays through Thursdays 11 
a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic eateries in mini-malls, Greek Cuisine in Tustin boasts exquisite taramo, 
creamed carp roe, fall-off-the-bone oregano chicken and a fine array of Greek 
specialties, while Flamingo in Fountain Valley is more terra incognita: seco 
norteno (piquant lamb stew in onion gravy), papas a la Huancaina (potatoes in a 
cheese sauce blanket), picarone (hot pumpkin fritters in blackstrap molasses). 
Both restaurants are casual and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
* Viva Italia, 303 Broadway, Laguna Beach. (714) 497-6220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
The VIVA in Viva Italia is an acronym for the first initials of brothers 
Vittorio, Ignacio, Vincenzo and Antonio Romeo, and the restaurant seems to have 
caught on as neatly. It's a somewhat cramped version of an Italian trattoria: 
terra cotta floor, tile kitchen, elbow-to-elbow seating. Food is simple and 
straightforward but erratic. Pastas and wood fired pizzas are the best bets. 
Beach crowd salads and ill-conceived main courses can be passed over. Service 
is snappy and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
* Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5 
to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is currently Orange County's only bona fide 
Cajun restaurant: The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. 
Indulge yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden 
flavors; oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and 
spicy tomato; and stuffed trout, pan fried in pure butter. Blackened items are 
a must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf. Dixieland music on tape furnishes 
the nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
* Hyang Chon, 12921 Fern St., Stanton. (714) 891-5166. Open daily from 10 a.m. 
to 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Eel, grilled short ribs and barbecued herring are just a few items on this 
Korean restaurant's exotic and varied menu. Pan cha, colorful side dishes, are 
especially good here, with such specialties as gae jang, raw marinated crab, 
and jap chae, glass noodle with meat and vegetable. Lunchtime prices are a 
steal. 
</P>
<P>
* Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9314. Open Mondays through 
Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular 
during the fifties and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes 
in credible versions of plain old American food-prime rib, pan fried chicken, 
turkey with all the trimmings-all churned out with dependable regularity. The 
menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice of 
Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the tapioca 
pudding you get for free. 
</P>
<P>
* The Hobbit, 2932 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 997-1972. Open for dinner 
Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Hobbit is a special occasion restaurant, serving prix fixe dinners that are 
elaborate without being pretentious. Book well in advance. You begin the 
evening in the restaurant's wine cellar, nibbling on Julia Child-like 
appetizers, sipping champagne and chatting with total strangers. Chef Mike 
Phillippi takes it all very seriously, preparing solid food that is 
well-balanced, though rarely brilliant. Entrees like beef Wellington and 
lobster Thermidor rotate weekly. Service is performed by smiling waitresses in 
print uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
* Ghandi, 3820-D Plaza Dr., South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. (714) 
556-7273. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandhi could be called new wave Indian: it roasts quail in its clay oven and 
pours Beaujolais nouveau as often as beer. Phlegmatic waiters in fancy tuxedoes 
perform service on the brass enclosed patio, a former pizzeria that looks more 
like Paris than Delhi. Appetizers like chicken tikka salad and the various 
tandoori dishes are refined and pleasant. Spicy dishes like lamb in spinach 
puree and curried eggplant are even better. Expensive. 
</P>
<P>
* Grappa, 2304 W. Ocean Front, Newport Beach. (714) 675-1930. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Grappa, housed in what used to be Zeppa, is yet another beachfront Italian 
restaurant in Newport. New owner Vincenzo Gentile hasn't changed the basic 
concept: The restaurant still resembles a Florentine villa, with a kitchen that 
churns out such favorites as great fried calamari, salads with lots of balsamic 
vinegar, and upscale pastas such as agnolotti and penne. Nodino alla griglia, 
an excellent veal chop grilled with aromatic herbs, is a standout. Desserts are 
intelligently underindulgent. 
</P>
<P>
* Places Afar, 25932 Muirlands Blvd., Mission Viejo. (714) 581-4200. Open daily 
except Tuesdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Calesa, 2106 Tustin Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 541-6585. Open daily except Sundays 
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is 
circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes 
alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup. 
Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics 
as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining" 
-- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental 
specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and 
cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos 
flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust. 
</P>
<P>
* Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin (714) 730-3442. Open 
Sundays through Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers and some 
mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait half an hour for institutional 
food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings, mountains of 
flour dredged onions deep fried until crispy, and the sappy sweet barbecue that 
kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible here, with 
fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed-to-order OJ. Portions are 
predictably generous and prices are modest. 
</P>
<P>
* Baci, 18478 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesdays 
through Sundays from 5:30 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker 
Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are 
touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu. 
Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone or some 
cold garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes such as fettuccine agnello, flat noodles 
with stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain 
the enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee. 
</P>
<P>
* Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. 
(714) 750-4321. Open Fridays through Tuesdays from 6 to 11 p.m. Call for lunch 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there 
can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is 
predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu 
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad, 
and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the 
mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is 
extensive and intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
* Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open 
Tuesdays through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 11, Sundays from 
5:30 to 11 only. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish, 
French, and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic. 
Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid 
array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and 
warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting 
main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort 
of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
* Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays 
through Thursdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 
8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays 
through Sundays from noon to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for 
adventurous inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on 
McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in 
Central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc, 
sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can 
experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef." 
The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go. 
</P>
<P>
* Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The early returns show Bagatta to have a healthy lead in the Newport Beach 
Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining 
scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen. 
Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio, 
latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular 
beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts such as zucotto and 
homemade spumoni are other-worldly. 
</P>
<P>
* Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is 
serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play 
no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di 
pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are 
delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo, 
turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese 
is the best you'll find anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
* Five Feet Too, in Fashion Island, 1145 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. 
(714) 640-5250. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The gentrification of Chinese cuisine reaches new heights of absurdity in this 
self-consciously chic restaurant, the second effort of owner chef Michael Kang. 
The restaurant is visually stunning but often comes up short in the taste 
department: Many dishes are precious and ill-conceived. The signature 
deep-fried catfish is excellent, and some imaginative dishes work well. Curried 
beef spring rolls are delightful. Kung pao three, with chicken, scallops and 
shrimp, is too. Desserts also are fine. Pity they don't serve humble pie. 
</P>
<P>
* The Towers, in the Surf and Sand Hotel, 155 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. 
(714) 497-4477. Open daily for breakfast and lunch and for dinner from 5:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a task to upstage the commanding sweep of the California coastline at the 
Towers, a Laguna Beach restaurant perched atop a beachfront hotel. New 
executive chef Jackson Kenworth tries his mightiest. He came from Citrus in Los 
Angeles, and he shows his mettle in a variety of dishes. Home-cured salmon is a 
delight, served in bite-sized nubs. Sea scallops in a Citrus-like potato 
risotto are sensational. Warm short rib terrine with vegetables in a mustard 
vinaigrette is as original as they come. 
</P>
<P>
* Capers, 34150 Coast Highway, Dana Point. (714) 661-3983. Open daily from 
11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Capers is a bright new seafood restaurant occupying the site of the former 
Dana Trader, and it has a beachy, casual air well suited to the location. The 
food isn't half bad when the kitchen plays it straight, but the kitchen tries 
too hard to be creative, often with disastrous results. There is a noble, 
garlicky Caesar, not for wimps, some fair broiled fish and several good shrimp 
dishes. Be wary of the ill-conceived attempts at nouvelle, especially anything 
with the horrid lime dipping sauce, coconut batter -- or capers, the 
restaurant's signature condiment. 
</P>
<P>
* Ten Hu, 315 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim. (714) 826-9910. Open Tuesdays through 
Thursdays and Sundays 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Hu doesn't compare with Chinese restaurants in Chinatown or the San Gabriel 
Valley, but that shouldn't put you off. Just remember that the steamed fish 
might be frozen. Winter melon soup with shredded chicken is a masterwork, and 
the Sichuan shrimps are particularly fine. It's primarily a seafood restaurant, 
but you may do just as well with the non-seafood items such as the Peking 
spareribs or the mouth-watering rice noodle dishes. Stay away from the 
retro-Chinese standbys such as chop suey and egg foo young. They're awful. 
</P>
<P>
* Salud, 17401 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-1194. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Salud, a new high-concept Mexican restaurant from Larry Cano, has an 
outlandish design that looks like a set Roger Corman might have used for a 
movie on Aztec discomania. All the trendy Mexican buttons are pushed: 
hand-shaken margaritas, '80s chiles, blue corn. Avoid the usual Meximush and 
head for the soups, grilled meats and desserts. Pozole verde is hominy and 
shredded chicken in broth, and it's great. So is Ibarra chocolate bread 
pudding, little cubes of fudge soaked bread in a tequila orange cream sauce. 
Prices are reasonable.

AT A BEACH UNDER SIEGE, RESIDENTS WAIT AND WORRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS and BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just after dawn Thursday, they began to gather. Some would stay for an hour or 
so; some stayed much of the day. They stood alone or in small clusters, engaged 
in quiet conversation or peering curiously at news crews. 
</P>
<P>
These were the residents of Huntington Beach, a city of 186,000 that grew up 
with precious oil wells in its back yards and now was facing the prospect of 
oil on its beach. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing they were powerless to stop it, they came to the shoreline anyway -- 
fearing what the 4 1/2-mile-wide, 2-mile-long patch of oil, still a couple of 
miles offshore, could do to this picture postcard day. 
</P>
<P>
By 5 p.m., long after much of the crowd had gone home, the fears finally began 
to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
What had been just a foul odor when the spill was first reported Wednesday 
turned into something palpable. The first oil -- a light brownish foam -- 
washed up on the shore north of the Huntington Beach Pier in the Huntington 
Bluffs area near Golden West Street and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays provided the first confirmation of the onshore 
arrival at a 6 p.m. press conference, describing the solution as having "a 
faint oily smell" and similar in appearance to the foam in a kitchen sink after 
washing a frying pan. 
</P>
<P>
A TV reporter, who went down to the waterline to assess the damage, yelled to 
his producer: "You can't see the damn stuff. This isn't like asphalt, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
But the light appearance of the first oil to wash ashore did not ease people's 
minds. "We're desecrating something very beautiful here," said Pat Hickey, 57, 
a Huntington Beach resident since 1968. "That ocean is beautiful and free, and 
now we're going to kill it." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, a sense of foreboding seemed to grip beach residents. 
Twenty-four hours before, they wondered whether the oil would reach the shore. 
Now there was no doubt. More answers would come with the light of dawn on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the nation came abruptly to Huntington Beach. By mid-morning, 
satellite dishes dotted the beach walkway near Pacific Coast Highway and 1st 
Street. Cable News Network and local and network television crews were 
broadcasting from the water's edge. Average citizens found themselves brushing 
elbows with state and local politicians who held press conferences, almost one 
after another. 
</P>
<P>
As the politicians talked, some of the crowd sat on blankets, but most stood. A 
few had binoculars. Some had home video cameras. But almost uniformly, they 
maintained an eerily constant gaze out to sea, waiting to see something they 
all said they hoped they wouldn't see. 
</P>
<P>
No one was allowed in the ocean, though the two- to four-foot waves made for a 
good surfing day. One 19-year-old man intent on surfing ignored several 
requests to get out of the water and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to keep people out of the water as a precaution," lifeguard 
Claude Panis said. "A lot of surfers are upset because they don't see any oil 
and we have good waves today." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more so than others, the lifeguards seemed to cherish the beauty of the 
coastline. "As a lifeguard, surfer and beach lover, I'm a little mad this 
happened," Panis said. "But it might be another thing the environmentalists can 
use as ammunition, so in a way, maybe it'll be a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
In the early afternoon, an airplane made a couple of passes carrying a banner 
that read: "Valdez Was Enough -- Please Keep America Clean." 
</P>
<P>
While many in the crowd were regular beach-goers, some made a special effort to 
see firsthand what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee Seward said her family watched news broadcasts of the spill and decided 
to do something to help. She took her three sons -- ages 12, 8 and 5 -- out of 
school so they could join the volunteer effort to find any birds that might 
have been caught in the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to show the kids how dangerous it is, that it kills the environment," 
Seward said. "I took them out of school because I feel this is a lesson in 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Guenther Franz and his wife were visiting California and said they came upon 
the beach somewhat by accident after taking a wrong turn while driving. But as 
they learned of the spill, it struck a responsive chord; the Franzes live on 
the shore of Lake Superior in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is accidents will happen, but what makes me suspicious is what are 
they doing in the future with these freighters?" Franz asked. "Why do we have 
to wait years to solve the problem?" 
</P>
<P>
Some in the crowd felt they were watching something potentially historic. Paul 
Englebright brought a home video camera to film the scene. But with little 
happening, he used most of his videotape on TV news crews or the crowd itself. 
And what if the oil actually were to wash on shore? "I have another roll of 
tape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But others said they came to help their hometown. "I think it's a sense of 
community," said Sharon Laraway, 42. "This is our home. Our children play here. 
We came down to help the wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
Noting the crowd's seemingly somber mood, she said, "I think there's a sense of 
sadness and outrage, especially since the Valdez trial is just beginning," a 
reference to the criminal trial in Alaska of Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph 
Hazelwood. 
</P>
<P>
The mood likely would have been more anxious had the onlookers been in closer 
touch with state wildlife officials two miles away. Using a lifeguard station 
at Pacific Coast Highway and Magnolia Street as a bird hospital, officials had 
collected about 25 birds by late Thursday afternoon, eight dead. 
</P>
<P>
The others were washed off with a mild dish soap and warmed up, the antidote to 
the oil that damages their ability to control their body temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife officials said that when volunteers began showing up before dawn, each 
was given a box and plastic gloves and sent off in search of injured birds. 
Officials expect to find many more birds in the days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the tip of the iceberg," lifeguard Lon Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
Although oil spills in California are always big news -- TV crews from San 
Diego and Phoenix were on hand -- the colorful history of Huntington Beach no 
doubt contributed to the media blitz. 
</P>
<P>
The city, popularized as the quintessential "Surf City" both in song and 
folklore, has served as the site for countless surfing competitions. Its nine 
miles of beaches and 85-year-old pier -- now scheduled to be razed and rebuilt 
-- helped shape the rest of the country's mythical view of California as the 
land of eternal sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
As the day wore on, the crowd began to dissipate like an early-morning fog. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Kahl, 30, a Huntington Beach contractor, was there all day with his 
4-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked if the vigil had been worthwhile. "Absolutely," Kahl said. "This 
beach is very important to me and my son. We want to be able to use it in 
future years."

MOSCOW DROPS ARMS PACT LINK TO 'STAR WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As both sides offered new ideas to speed arms control talks, the Soviet Union 
appeared Thursday to remove one of the last major obstacles to a U.S.-Soviet 
strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty by eliminating linkage between the 
treaty and the U.S. "Star Wars" program. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told visiting Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III that Moscow is willing to sign and implement a new Strategic 
Arms Reduction Talks (START) agreement to cut offensive weapons by about half 
without any declared linkage to how each side must conduct research work on 
defensive systems, according to a senior U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Moscow insisted that the START treaty could not be signed until the 
United States gave up its plan to develop a space-based anti-missile defense 
system, known as "Star Wars." Then, the Soviets edged away from that position 
step-by-step; now they have provided what the U.S. official termed "the 
important clarification on this longstanding question." 
</P>
<P>
However, Democrats in Congress may still insist on linking the offensive and 
defensive issues in their continuing effort to curtail the "Star Wars" program, 
another U.S. official said. But this official noted that, with or without such 
linkage, Congress would always have the power to enforce its policy on the 
program through the budgetary process. 
</P>
<P>
For its part in the joint attempt to complete new nuclear and conventional arms 
treaties by the end of the year, the U.S. side brought new proposals on how 
air-launched cruise missiles should be counted within the total of 6,000 
nuclear weapons to which both nations would be limited under a new START 
agreement. Essentially, the new U.S. proposal offers a compromise on such 
issues as missile range and bomber carrying capabilities, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander A. Bessmertnykh said the new U.S. 
position on the cruise missiles "could promote the solution to this problem." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. negotiators also provided new ideas on how to monitor spare and stored 
missiles that are not deployed -- and how to broadcast openly the in-flight 
data from a missile test so that the other side will be aware of the missile's 
various characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them an awful lot to chew on," another senior U.S. official said. The 
initial Soviet reaction was positive, he added, and detailed replies are 
expected before Baker's visit ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also said that the Soviet side will 
continue to call for new arms talks to limit naval forces, as well as for 
limits on sea-launched cruise missiles. The United States is opposed to both. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's team also presented President Bush's new proposal to cut U.S. and 
Soviet troops on the ground in Central Europe to 195,000 for each side, as well 
as new ideas on how to count aircraft and tanks for any agreement to reduce 
conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The same proposals were presented Thursday by North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization nations to the Warsaw Pact at the 23-nation conventional forces 
negotiations that are under way in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, NATO's new aircraft proposal lowered its previously proposed 
ceiling on ground attack aircraft from 5,700 to 4,700 for each alliance and 
would exclude "primary trainers" -- jet training aircraft -- while allowing an 
additional 500 air-to-air fighter interceptors above the ceiling, according to 
reports from Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
A senior NATO official in Brussels was quoted by the Associated Press as saying 
that the NATO side also agreed to narrow the definition of combat helicopters 
to resolve a difference with the East. 
</P>
<P>
The new NATO position on counting tanks seeks to distinguish between large, or 
"main" battle tanks, on the one hand, and light tanks and armored personnel 
carriers on the other, within the 20,000 tanks and 28,000 personnel carriers 
that both sides have agreed to set as ceilings in these categories. 
</P>
<P>
The new troop ceiling being proposed was first announced Jan. 31 by President 
Bush. It represented an 80,000-soldier reduction in the previously proposed 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has an estimated 565,000 troops stationed in Europe outside 
its borders, with well over 500,000 of them within the central zone. There are 
about 305,000 U.S. troops in Western Europe, with approximately 250,000 of 
those stationed in the area of application, according to Western estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact offered no reaction Thursday to the formal NATO presentation. 
The senior NATO official told the Associated Press that the West expects a 
response at a meeting next week of the two alliances in Ottawa. The "Open 
Skies" gathering there is officially being held to review a plan for unarmed 
reconnaissance flights over rival alliance territories, a proposal designed to 
reduce East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet side's apparent concession on anti-missile defenses Thursday was an 
advance on its position in September. Back then, according to U.S. officials, 
it was demanding that the START treaty include a provision specifically giving 
either signatory the right to withdraw from the treaty if, in its judgment, the 
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty was being violated. 
</P>
<P>
The demand was aimed at giving the Soviet Union leverage with which to curb 
"Star Wars." It could contend that any project being conducted in the program 
is a violation of the ABM agreement and threaten to withdraw from the START 
treaty unless it were stopped. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets now say they would still prefer such a clause, "but not as a 
precondition for signing and implementing the START agreement," the senior U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new Soviet position, each side will have the right to withdraw from 
the treaty if its "supreme national interests" are jeopardized -- a standard 
phrase in arms agreements -- but the START treaty will not be directly tied to 
the ABM treaty.

Winds kept a two-mile-long slick of Alaskan crude oil from washing ashore 
Thursday, raising hopes that the 300,000-gallon spill -- the worst in Southern 
California in two decades -- can be cleaned up before seriously damaging a 
prized wildlife sancutary and miles of prime Orange County shoreline, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been extremely lucky," said Peter Bontadelli, director of the state 
Department of Fish and Game. "The good weather and offshore breezes have saved 
us thus far. The oil has not hit the beaches." 
</P>
<P>
As scores of anxious environmentalists, local officials and state experts 
monitored its movement, the purplish slick -- about 2 miles long and 4 miles 
wide -- drifted several miles off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it was too large to encircle with a boom, so clean up efforts 
focused on scooping up the light crude from the damaged tanker, American 
Trader. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials had initially ruled out using chemical dispersants because of 
their toxic nature. But Thursday, the U.S. Coast Guard was seeking permission 
from the U.S Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Fish 
and Game to employ dispersants to break up the slick. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators zeroed in on one of the ship's anchors as the apparent cause of 
the 7,000-barrel spill late Wednesday afternoon in relatively shallow coastal 
waters. The 21-year-old tanker attempted to moor offshore when the portside 
anchor apparently punctured the single-hulled vessel, the ship's owner said. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of gallons of oil poured through a 3-foot gash before emergency teams 
halted the leak early Thursday. The tanker, in a routine maneuver, was 
preparing to unload its cargo of crude through underwater pipelines leading to 
a Santa Fe Springs refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The anchor theory was supported by Coast Guard officials. "It's very likely the 
anchor," said Chief Warrant Officer Dan Dewell. "Our investigators have have 
seen the damage to the anchor." Another Coast Guard officer said: "The anchor 
is now bent like a banana." 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the tanker, American Trading Transportation Co. of New York, deployed 
divers to asess the extent of damage to the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Commandant Paul A. Yost, Jr., who flew to the scene from Washington 
on Thursday, said there is a good chance that virtually all of the spilled oil 
will be removed before it can wash ashore if the weather holds. "I can't tell 
you what percentage will come ashore, but we hope none," Yost told reporters 
gathered near the historic Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
A stream of local and state politicans descended on Huntington Beach Thursday, 
staging a series of press conferences to voice support for clean up efforts and 
raise questions about oil drilling and tanker movement in Southern California 
coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this oil spill sends a strong message to Sacramento and Washington," 
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy said at a morning press conference on the beach 
overlooking the spill. "It was just pure dumb luck we didn't have a tragedy. We 
shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner said he would meet 
with President Bush to brief him on the incident, adding that the oil company 
and owners of the tanker expressed their "commitment to me" to help in cleaning 
up the oil. 
</P>
<P>
As the spill clean-up moved into its second day, protests from offshore oil 
drilling opponents grew. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental organization, said 
little comfort could be taken in the fact that the spill had remained offshore 
or that clean up operations were under way. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though the flow of oil has been stopped, the ability of the oil industry 
and the government to clean up the 300,000 gallons that were spilled into the 
Pacific Ocean is pathetic," the NRDC said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Edgerton, with the NRDC's Los Angeles office, said, "The spreading slick 
from the impaled American Trader presents an imminent threat to the 
ecologically important wetlands of Bolsa Chica, Anaheim Bay, and Upper Newport, 
some of the healthiest wetlands left in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the warnings, officials said that so far the environmental impact has 
been remarkably minimal from the spill, the worst since the catastrophic 1969 
Santa Barbara spill when 3.2 million gallons of crude fouled beaches for months 
and killed thousands of shore birds. 
</P>
<P>
"We got lucky, it could have been a lot worse," said biologist Victor Leipzig, 
executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, a grassroots environmental 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach officials, who declared a state of emergency and planned to 
meet Thursday night to map out clean up stratgies should the oil wash ashore, 
kept their fingers crossed that their shoreline would be spared major damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been dodging bullets for 24 hours," City Councilman Jim Silva said. 
"This is one of the most popular beaches in California. It would be a shame if 
we lost it." 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen oil-coated birds were rescued Thursday by volunteers and 
biologists, who set up a command post and wildlife treatment center on the sand 
south of the Huntington pier. In all, 25 oil-covered birds have reportedly been 
recovered, of which eight have died. 
</P>
<P>
Fear persisted, however, that the oil would wreck environmental havoc if and 
when it reaches shore. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly if the wind and currents shift and it starts moving in, we're going to 
have what we always said -- significant shoreline impacts," said Brian Baird, 
an oil spill expert with the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Fish and game chief Bontadelli said that if the oil hits the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, upper Newport Harbor and the mouth of the Santa Ana River it will 
take 2 1/2 years for the ecosystem to recover. The Bolsa Chica wetlands, the 
focus of intense battles between environmentalists and develoeprs, is home to 
dozens of bird species including the Light-footed Clapper Rails and Lest terns, 
both endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"The wetlands are the key to all marine life as well as shore birds and 
wintering water fowl," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Petroleum confirmed Thursday that the spilled oil was 
Alaskan North Slope oil, the same oil that bled from the Exxon Valdez last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
However, California's warmer climate may cause the oil to evaporate sooner than 
it did in Alaska's Prince William Sound, as well as appear lighter in color. 
</P>
<P>
"With warmer water temperatures, the (more volatile components of the oil) 
would (evaporate) quicker," said Charles Webster, BP's manager of crisis 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the persistence of what's left, it's probably not a great deal 
different (from Valdez) except it might remain more liquid than it would if it 
were in an extremely cold climate," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal emergency response team considered attempting to clean up the oil by 
using chemical dispersants or setting the oil slick on fire. But both options 
were ruled out after reviewing the scene, said Kathleen Shimmin of the EPA. 
Both ideas were abandoned because of health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too close to land," Shimmin said. "We would never consider using 
dispersement if mechanical cleanup is working, and in this case it's working . 
. . We'd use putting toxic chemicals into the environment and posing a 
potential hazard to the wildlife to clean up a spill as a last step." 
</P>
<P>
The use of chemical dispersants is controversial because they are toxic to 
marine life and because their effectiveness is uneven, according to the 
National Academy of Sciences. State fish and game officials said that if 
dispersants are used, it would like injury snails, halibut and other 
bottow-dwelling creatures. It could also fish larvae in the spill area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the trade off for not hitting sensitive coastal areas," said fish and 
game spokesman Curt Taucher. 
</P>
<P>
Ecological experts and environmentalists who visited the scene said the oil 
slick threatens to sicken or kill species all through the aquatic food chain -- 
from the microspic plankton that float in fresh water, through mussels and 
anchiovies and sardines, up to sea lions whose fur can be matted by the crude 
oil, leaving them vulnerable to the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Clean up efforts centered around several large skimming vessels that attempted 
to scoop up the oil. Booms were placed around the front of the tanker to 
contain spilled oil near the hole in the hull, but the size of the larger slick 
made the use of skimmers necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cause of the spill is still under investigation, the ship's owner 
said that alcohol tests performed on the tanker's skipper initially appear to 
be "negative." The results will not be complete, however, for at least two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Murphy, vice president of American Trading, said the company considers the 
tanker's skipper Robert La Ware "an able and experienced seaman." 
</P>
<P>
"He has been with our company 30 years and he's an extremely experienced master 
on the West Coast," Murphy told reporters. "He has put this ship and many 
others on moorings many, many times." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after dawn today, about 150 gawkers and volunteers gathered near the 
Huntington Beach pier to watch the idle tanker offshore and look for oil on the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lived in Huntington Beach all my life," said Sam Cracchiolo. "But never 
in a million years did I think this would happen here." 
</P>
<P>
Residents as far inland as two miles said they could smell the crude. Police 
dispatchers said they received several dozen calls from concerned residents. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Ted Lempert, chairman of the Assembly Select Committee on Spill 
Prevention, said that the American Trader's ruptured tanks contained about 
20,000 barrels of crude and about 6,000 barrels were lost. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of oil spilled from the American Trader is about 3% of what was 
spilled in the Exxon Valdez tragedy," Lempert said.

OIL SLICK REACHES SHORE AT NEWPORT, HUNTINGTON BEACH;

ENVIRONMENT: SHIFT IN WIND ENDS HOPE TO CONTAIN SPILL FROM TANKER, ALTHOUGH 
MOST REMAINS SEVERAL MILES FROM COAST. WILDLIFE SANCTUARY IS SPARED.

<P>
After drifting for more than a day off the Southern California coast, the first 
wave of 300,000 gallons of crude oil spilled by the disabled tanker American 
Trader began washing up along several miles of Orange County shoreline Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen who braved the advancing slick had to wipe the black goo from their 
lines, while spectators who ventured to the water's edge scooped up handfuls of 
the muck and struggled to clean their hands. And Newport Beach's mascot, 
Charlie the Sea Lion, swam through the muck near the Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards and city officials in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach reported 
that an oily brown foam began appearing along the surf line in both cities at 
about dusk, and continued washing ashore through the night. At first the oil 
appeared as droplets in the surf, but within hours the water's surface had 
turned to a thick, foamy concentration fouling at least half a mile of 
beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
But Coast Guard officials said the bulk of the slick remained several miles off 
Huntington Beach, where efforts continued to scoop up the Alaskan crude that 
spewed from the tanker on Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of optimistic predictions that favorable weather conditions might 
keep the slick at sea long enough to be cleaned up, a late-afternoon breeze 
foiled hopes of keeping the oil away from the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in winds, however, apparently spared a prized wildlife sanctuary any 
serious damage, authorities said. The Bolsa Chica wetlands, home to several 
endangered species of birds, was threatened for a time early Thursday as the 
oil slick drifted northeast from the leaking 800-foot tanker, which apparently 
struck its own anchor as it attempted to moor off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen oil-coated birds were picked up Thursday by volunteers and 
biologists, who set up a command post and wildlife treatment center on the sand 
south of the Huntington Beach Pier. So far, 25 oil-covered birds have 
reportedly been recovered, of which eight have died. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting the beaches is obviously a disaster for us -- oil up and down the 
beaches, the marinas, into the boats, just one thing after another," said 
Newport Beach City Councilman Clarence J. Turner. "The whole area is critical." 
</P>
<P>
As scores of anxious environmentalists, local officials and state experts 
monitored the worst spill in Southern California in two decades, the purplish 
slick -- about 2 miles long and 4 1/2 miles wide -- had drifted slowly most of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said it was too large to encircle with a boom, so cleanup efforts 
focused on scooping up the light crude from the damaged tanker. 
</P>

Federal officials had initially ruled out using chemical dispersants because of 
their toxic nature. But on Thursday, the Coast Guard was seeking permission 
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Fish 
and Game to employ dispersants to break up the slick. A decision is expected 
sometime today.

is now bent like a banana." 
</P>
<P>
Although the cause of the spill is still under investigation, the ship's owner 
said that alcohol tests performed Wednesday night on the tanker's captain, 
second mate and pilot -- administered by Coast Guard officials in the presence 
of Navy investigators -- appeared to be negative. The results of drug tests, 
however, will not be known for at least two days. 
</P>

some of the healthiest wetlands left in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
The National Ocean Industries Assn. issued a statement asserting that the spill 
should not be used as a reason to delay oil leasing off the California coast or 
any other state. 
</P>
<P>
The trade group said that since 1970, there have been only 10 oil spills in 
excess of 1,000 barrels on the outer continental shelf. None of those spills 
caused significant environmental damage, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"Critics of offshore energy development must not be allowed to confuse the 
facts in an effort to shut down one of the nation's safest sources of future 
energy supplies," the association said. 
</P>
<P>

been remarkably minimal in the worst oil spill since the catastrophic 1969

</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the chairman of a task force that studied the Valdez spill in 
Alaska warned state lawmakers that they cannot rely on a private company alone 
to clean up a spill as large as the one off Huntington Beach, and added that 
cleanup costs will skyrocket if much of the oil hits the sandy shore. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you've got it on the beach, even if you have a successful cleanup, you're 
going to incur a tremendous cost," said Walter B. Parker, chairman of the 
Alaska Oil Spill Commission.

Deliberations were apparently back on track in the assault trial of reputed 
Mafia boss John Gotti in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin had told bickering jurors to 
stop attacking one another and try to work together. Gotti, 49, reputed head of 
the Gambino crime family, is accused of ordering the wounding of John O'Connor, 
the business agent of Carpenters Union Local 608. The violence was allegedly 
ordered in retaliation for the trashing of a Gambino-owned restaurant built 
with non-union labor.

NORIEGA TOLD HE MUST FACE TRIAL IN U.S.

A federal judge Thursday rejected claims that Manuel A. Noriega should be 
transferred to a neutral country as a prisoner of war and ruled that he must 
stand trial in a U.S. civilian court on drug conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler that they will be 
ready to try the ousted Panamanian dictator by year's end. But defense lawyer 
Frank A. Rubino said that the trial could be delayed for up to two years 
because of the complexities involved in obtaining thousands of sensitive 
government files needed by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides estimated that the historic trial will last 10 months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler seemed exasperated by the time estimates. He shook his head at one 
point and said: "I'm just contemplating the length of time we're talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
But he vowed to do everything he could to move the proceedings along. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing in this case is that we not let it flounder," he said. 
"This case is too important to let it drift." 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler issued his ruling on jurisdiction two weeks after Rubino contended 
that the fallen general should be considered a prisoner of war because he 
surrendered to U.S. military authorities after the U.S. invasion of Panama on 
Dec. 20. Rubino said that Noriega should be transferred to a neutral country 
pending a trial there, in Panama or in the World Court at The Hague in the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Justice Department agreed to treat Noriega as a POW. But, under 
the 1949 Geneva Convention, POWs may be tried for ordinary crimes in a civilian 
court as long as soldiers of the host country would be considered criminals for 
the same offenses, department lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
"The Geneva Convention clearly authorizes a prosecution of this sort," Deputy 
Solicitor General William P. Bryson told Hoeveler Thursday, noting that Noriega 
was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida in February, 1988, on 
charges of taking millions of dollars in bribes to help Colombian drug gangs 
smuggle cocaine into the United States through Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler agreed with the Justice Department's reasoning, saying: "I don't find 
under the Geneva Convention that I must divest myself of jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, dressed in his khaki military uniform as he sat behind his lawyers, 
showed no emotion when Hoeveler's ruling was translated for him. Hoeveler 
acknowledged that his original March 5 trial date was unrealistic, but he did 
not set a new date. 
</P>
<P>
Government attorneys said that they were proceeding under terms of the 
Classified Information Procedures Act to examine "tens of thousands of 
documents" that may relate to Noriega's work as a secret informant for the CIA 
and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration over more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino has said that Noriega's defense against drug-trafficking charges may 
involve claims that U.S. intelligence agents condoned his links to notorious 
Colombian drug dealers as long as he supplied valuable information about their 
activities, and other matters, to the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said he hoped to rule within two to three weeks on requests by five 
co-defendants that they receive separate trials. Noriega's lawyers privately 
are encouraging the move in anticipation that the government will have to 
expose some of its key witnesses to cross-examination if earlier trials are 
held for his former associates. 
</P>
<P>
In another development Thursday, the British High Court ordered British banks 
to freeze accounts linked to Noriega. British investigators believe Noriega 
could be holding up to $845,000 in British banks. The Justice Department 
believes accounts controlled by Noriega in Europe total more than $10 million.

2 U.S. WOMEN PILOTS CAME UNDER HEAVY PANAMA FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
COMBAT: THE DISCLOSURE IS A NEW INDICATION OF THE EXTENT THAT WOMEN TOOK PART 
IN THE INVASION.

Two women helicopter pilots shuttling soldiers into combat during the early 
hours of the U.S. invasion of Panama came under gunfire so fierce that one of 
the choppers had to be grounded, Army officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of their performance under fire, the two have been recommended 
for the Air Medal with a "V" for valor. They would become the first women to 
receive the decoration with the valor designation. 
</P>
<P>
The account of the two pilots flying UH-60 "Blackhawk" helicopters through 
skies alight with tracer bullets provided a new indication of the degree to 
which women soldiers in Panama found themselves caught up in combat, from which 
they are barred by Army policy. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Army official emphasized that the women had been assigned to the 
shuttle mission over Panama City with the expectation that it would involve 
only normal aviation duties, but "it just so happened that they found 
themselves in a situation where there was gunfire." 
</P>
<P>
"At night, when you see the tracer bullets coming at you, you realize you could 
end up giving your life for your country," one of the women, Lt. Lisa 
Kutschera, told the Associated Press, which first reported the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Kutschera and Warrant Officer Debra Mann encountered the gunfire as they rushed 
paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division in the early morning of Dec. 20 
from their initial landing site at Torrijos International Airport to various 
objectives around Panama City, military sources said. 
</P>
<P>
After one such trip, Mann's helicopter was discovered to have been hit by 
several rounds and damaged so badly that it was grounded, the Army officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Mann told the AP that she and the rest of the crew had "heard the shots but 
didn't even know we had been hit." Their commander, Capt. Thomas Muir, who was 
shot in the head during one of the operations, said the women "took a 
tremendous amount of fire." 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers who were shuttled on the helicopter missions have described the 
gunfire they encountered while in the air as some of the heaviest they faced in 
Panama, with bullets flying from unexpected directions as Panamanian soldiers 
fought from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, paratroopers who were ferried toward the hilltop Panama Defense 
Forces garrison of Tinajitas said their helicopters were riddled with automatic 
weapons fire from surrounding bluffs as they approached the appointed landing 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be learned exactly which missions the two women participated in, 
and Army officials said they did not know whether the helicopters returned 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Debate about excluding women soldiers from combat missions has surfaced with 
new vehemence in the aftermath of the Panama invasion, which provided evidence 
that the distinction between combat and noncombat roles might be artificial in 
modern warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The issue gained attention after press accounts, later repeated by White House 
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, reported that Army Capt. Linda Bray led a force of 
30 military police in a three-hour gun battle with elements of the 
now-disbanded Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Army officials said later that the accounts were inflated and that the exchange 
of fire lasted only 10 minutes, causing no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of action seen by Bray and other Army women, Rep. Patricia 
Schroeder (D-Colo.), has called for legislation directing the Army to move 
toward permitting women to serve in all military jobs, including combat. 
</P>
<P>
An Army official said the two women helicopter pilots were nominated to receive 
the Air Medal for the "extraordinary manner in which they performed their 
duties as air crewmen," and have also been recommended for an additional "V" 
decoration for their valor. 
</P>
<P>
The men in the Ft. Ord-based unit also were recommended for medals, the two 
women told the AP. Final decisions about the medals are to be made by Army Lt. 
Gen. Carl W. Stiner, who acted as operational commander during the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
A third helicopter pilot, Warrant Officer Caryl Newberry, was also nominated to 
receive an Air Medal after she came under small arms fire while flying a 
helicopter on a logistics mission Dec. 21, an Army spokesman said.

U.S. FEARS TERRORIST ATTACK IN EUROPE ON IRAN ANNIVERSARY

The United States is deeply concerned about the possibility of a terrorist 
attack against Americans or U.S. installations in Europe to coincide with the 
upcoming 11th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the State 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy department spokesman Richard Boucher recalled that a threat advisory was 
issued last December, and he said that threat continues. 
</P>
<P>
The anniversary of Iran's revolution is this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher added that the United States has no specific information about any 
possible terrorist operation or its target. 
</P>
<P>
"If further credible or specific information on this threat develops, the 
department will issue additional alerts to travelers and other concerned 
parties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tehran government late Thursday rejected the State Department's warning as 
baseless. A press statement issued by Iran's U.N. mission also said that it has 
brought "this grave issue" to the attention of the U.N. secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic Republic of Iran categorically rejects the baseless allegation 
made by the U.S. State Department, and considers them (sic) vain attempts to 
discredit the Islamic revolution," it said. 
</P>
<P>
In his comments, Boucher added that the department is encouraging travelers to 
Europe to exercise caution but that Americans are not being urged to cancel 
plans they may have to visit the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
The statement issued last December said the concern was based partly on reports 
of movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the discovery of weapons 
shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in Spain and Africa.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson told hundreds of people in this impoverished black 
township Thursday that their struggle to win civil rights from the white-led 
government has inspired hope around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Touring Soweto on the second day of his 12-day visit to South Africa, the black 
U.S. civil rights leader walked down streets of ramshackle squatters' huts, 
stopped at a day-care center, visited the home of African National Congress 
leader Walter Sisulu and spoke to township teachers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Orlando Home and Creche, a day-care center, Jackson took preschool 
children on his knee and posed for pictures under a banner reading, "Welcome 
Baba Jesse Jackson. . . . We Love You Very, Very Much." 
</P>
<P>
"Baba" is a term of respect. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing speeches he made on the campaign trail during the 1988 presidential 
race, Jackson roared to youths gathered outside Sisulu's home: "Keep your head 
high! Keep hope alive!" 
</P>
<P>
Jackson listened as Sisulu led a crowd of 100 in singing the hymn "God Bless 
Africa," which black nationalists hope will become the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
"You've inspired hope around the world," Jackson declared. "It's so good to see 
you express your will to be free, and to see you determined to put hope in your 
heart and hope in your brains, and not dope in your veins."

REPORTED THREATS DELAY MANDELA RELEASE; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: THE GOVERNMENT SAYS WARNINGS HAVE COME FROM BOTH RADICAL BLACKS 
AND RIGHT-WING WHITES.

<P>
The government said Thursday that the security concerns holding up the release 
of jailed nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela include threats against his life 
from both radical left-wing blacks and right-wing whites. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him to get out of that prison and walk the streets of our country as a 
free man . . . and alive," said Adriaan Vlok, the government minister of law 
and order. He added that arrangements for Mandela's protection have not been 
completed, but will be made in consultation with the prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk said last week that Mandela's security and 
unspecified "personal circumstances" were the main things delaying the 
71-year-old African National Congress leader's release after more than 27 years 
in prison. However, anti-apartheid activists say the government may also be 
stalling while it studies reaction to De Klerk's reform package and considers 
meeting more of the ANC's conditions for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk and his Cabinet ministers are counting on Mandela to help them get 
negotiations with the black majority under way. Mandela has used his position 
from inside South Africa's prison system to play the role of facilitator for 
talks between the government and the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela is said to have made it clear to the government that the ANC will 
not sit at the table with De Klerk until he lifts the 3 1/2-year-old state of 
emergency and releases political prisoners. Fifteen activists, including 
Mandela, are serving life terms, and 2,500 are imprisoned for shorter terms for 
politically inspired crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Both the ANC and the government worry about Mandela's safety once he is freed. 
The government is considering round-the-clock police protection for Mandela, if 
he wants it, Vlok said. He added that allowing armed ANC members to protect 
Mandela is also being studied. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to specify the threats against Mandela. But Vlok said that 
threats from the right have increased in recent weeks and "most of their 
threats are centered around his release." Militant right-wing groups, who are 
few but well-armed, say Mandela is a terrorist whose freedom will incite 
violence among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Vlok said, police investigators have heard threats 
from black factions who are upset that Mandela has been playing the role of 
facilitator with the government. 
</P>
<P>
That is one of the reasons the government has advanced for maintaining its 
remaining emergency regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Vlok told Parliament on Thursday that the emergency is still needed because of 
the "extremely explosive political situation in the country at present." 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many irresponsible people who are only too eager to take 
advantage of existing problem areas in a reckless way," Vlok said. "The 
revolutionary climate is still unnaturally high." 
</P>
<P>
As Vlok spoke, police in the Johannesburg township of Alexandra used tear gas 
to disperse several thousand blacks protesting a tour by an English cricket 
team. The team is defying an international ban on sports contact with South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Police said eight journalists covering the clash were briefly detained when 
they refused to leave. De Klerk ended most restrictions on press coverage of 
unrest last Friday, but the police said they were acting under other emergency 
regulations that empower them to order anyone to leave any area. 
</P>
<P>
Police later used clubs to break up a smaller protest involving about a hundred 
people outside a Johannesburg building housing the British Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
But in Port Elizabeth, more than 50,000 blacks marched peacefully to a 
government education office and presented a petition calling for better 
facilities for black education and an end to segregated schools.

U.S. EXPECTS S. AFRICAN MOVES TO END SANCTIONS

The Bush Administration anticipates that South Africa will comply with the 
standards set by Congress for lifting U.S. economic sanctions by the end of 
this year, according to a senior U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who talked to a small group of reporters Wednesday on the 
understanding that he would not be identified by name, said it now seems clear 
that sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations played a role in 
the decision by South African President Frederik W. de Klerk last week to lift 
many restrictions on several long-banned black and anti-apartheid 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were enacted by Congress over the veto of President Ronald Reagan 
in 1986. At the time, Administration officials said they thought the sanctions 
would be counterproductive, diminishing U.S. influence in Pretoria without 
producing any change in the policy of the white minority-led government. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration official said De Klerk decided to seek greater 
cooperation with the black majority because he became convinced that the South 
African economy could prosper only with cooperation between the races. 
</P>
<P>
"This realization has been pushed along by international pressure, including 
American pressure," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the sanctions law, the President may lift the sanctions if 
South Africa releases all political prisoners and takes any three of these 
steps: 
</P>
<P>
* Repeals the state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
* Ends the ban on political groups, such as the African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
* Repeals the Group Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation. 
</P>
<P>
* Agrees to enter good faith negotiations with "truly representative members of 
the black community." 
</P>
<P>
The official said that De Klerk has complied with two of the standards -- 
repeal of the ban on political groups and agreement to negotiate. He said he 
expects South Africa to move soon, certainly by the end of the year, to free 
all political prisoners and end the state of emergency. He said the government 
has said it will go slower in repealing the Group Areas Act. 
</P>
<P>
Until the sanctions can be legally lifted, the official said, Washington hopes 
to show its support for De Klerk's reforms by increasing high-level diplomatic 
contacts. He said De Klerk has already been invited to visit the United States, 
although no dates have been set. And he said that a top Administration 
official, possibly Secretary of State James A. Baker III, might soon travel to 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The official said that Washington plans to apply steady pressure on both the 
South African government and the black leadership to proceed with negotiations 
over the future of the country. Both sides have agreed to meet, but they are 
still haggling over ground rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We will put pressure on both sides to negotiate," he said.

WORLD BANK OKS $30-MILLION QUAKE LOAN FOR CHINA; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN AID: A SECOND LOAN IS SHELVED. U.S. SAYS IT WOULD COME TOO SOON AFTER 
THE BEIJING MASSACRE.

The World Bank approved a $30-million earthquake relief loan to China on 
Thursday, the first loan it has made to that country since the Beijing massacre 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
But the organization's 22-member executive board postponed action on a second 
loan after the Bush Administration, facing criticism from Congress, complained 
that the bank was moving too rapidly to resume lending to China. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's action followed President Bush's decision in January to relax a 
seven-month-old U.S. freeze on such lending. Bush said the United States now 
will support loans for "human needs" such as earthquake relief, but will 
continue to oppose those for broader development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to that policy shift, World Bank President Barber B. Conable had 
scheduled two loans for consideration at the bank's executive board meeting: 
the quake aid and a companion $60-million loan intended to relieve poverty in 
rural Jiangxi province. 
</P>
<P>
While the board approved the earthquake-relief loan unanimously, it deferred 
action on the Jiangxi loan until Feb. 27 after representatives of the seven 
major industrial nations complained that the bank was lifting its freeze too 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is an international organization not required to follow U.S. 
policies, but officials acknowledged that Washington had orchestrated the 
lobbying campaign to persuade the bank to postpone action on the second loan. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is expected to be short-lived, but U.S. officials argued that it is 
important for symbolic reasons -- putting Beijing on notice that it is not yet 
off the hook for the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations at Tian 
An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials confirmed that the Treasury Department had lobbied "furiously" 
earlier this week to have the second loan postponed in an effort to "send a 
signal" to the World Bank's bureaucracy that Washington wants to move slowly in 
easing the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want them to look like they're opening the floodgates," one U.S. 
policy-maker said. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has been pressing for months to resume lending to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Washington has made its point, officials said, the United States will 
support the second loan when it comes up for consideration Feb. 27. 
Representatives of the six other major industrial nations -- Britain, France, 
Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada -- also are expected to go along. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has about $780-million in China loans pending, and about 
$7-billion worth of loan proposals for China in its pipeline. Thursday's action 
indicates that most will remain frozen for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's action came as the Administration continued to face a battering in 
Congress over its China policy, with lawmakers from both parties openly 
attacking the President's decision to send secret high-level missions to 
Beijing in July and December. 
</P>
<P>
At a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) 
called the trips by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and 
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft "one of the most misbegotten missions 
in contemporary American diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
And Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a conservative who traditionally supports the 
Administration on foreign policy issues, said the venture showed "tone-deafness 
toward the values and ideals this country stands for." 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has defended its policies, contending that Bush has been 
trying to steer a middle course that penalizes Beijing for the crackdown, yet 
maintains diplomatic contacts in hopes of retaining some influence with the 
Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleburger, appearing before the Foreign Affairs panel, argued that the only 
reason he and Scowcroft were sent to China was that the President wanted 
Chinese leaders to hear firsthand about his concern over human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
But many Democrats -- and some Republicans -- have refused to accept that 
explanation. Earlier this week, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) accused Bush of 
having contracted "clientitis" -- having become so close to China that he 
espouses Beijing's interests rather than those of America.

OIL SPILL DRAWS A FLOCK OF POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER

This foul glaze of crude oil sloshing over California's coastal waters 
threatens the birds, enrages the surfers, worries the beach dwellers, raises 
hell in the petroleum company board rooms . . . and, of course, sounds the call 
to action for California's election-minded politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Disasters always have a pull on politicos, even though such events can be risky 
propositions. Ridicule awaits those too eager to capitalize on someone else's 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not the case Thursday as officeholders lined up on the sands of 
Huntington Beach -- or via broadcast news hookups -- to decry this grim mix of 
oil and water on a sunny winter day. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps politicians seemed comfortable here at the scene because of 
California's bipartisan and seemingly hardening political consensus that the 
state is ill-protected from these kinds of crude disasters. Or maybe it was 
because oil spills, made by humans, are within the power of humans to control, 
if only with the right leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"This situation of the last 24 hours demonstrates conclusively that we have to 
do something, and we have to do it quickly," said candidate for governor John 
K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat and California's attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp stood in the sand with the tanker American Trader wallowing off in 
the hazy background with its frantic circle of tenders. A wooden State of 
California podium had been dragged onto the beach to add an official feel to 
the scene. But Van de Kamp followed political etiquette as to dressing down for 
disaster -- arriving in tennis shoes, gray slacks and a bright green cable-knit 
sweater, rather than a politician's suit and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Controller Gray Davis likewise stood at the podium wearing a sweater -- blue. 
</P>
<P>
Across the continent, Republican candidate for governor and U.S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson joined the Democrats in outrage via a pre-dawn television interview 
beamed home from Washington. He chose burgundy for his sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get the sweater memo," laughed Republican candidate for lieutenant 
governor John Seymour, a state senator from Anaheim. He showed up on the beach 
in coat and tie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wasn't all bad, though. Most of the media don't know me by sight. The 
fact that I had a tie on identified me -- they said, 'Hey, that guy has got to 
be a politician or somebody.' So I probably got more coverage this way." 
</P>
<P>
Leo T. McCarthy, the Democrat who is seeking a third term as lieutenant 
governor, showed up also in coat and tie. He was prepared to take off his 
jacket and go shirt-sleeved. "But I looked and I had a huge tear in my shirt, 
so I had to keep my coat on," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
The spill had barely begun before experts predicted that it would prod 
non-believers into action on new oil spill legislation in Congress and the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the more ambitious of the state's political leaders did not hesitate 
to size up its potential spillover into the 1990 California election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp figured spectators would feel as helpless as the oil slopping about 
at the mercy of the breezes. He offered them a way to take action -- by signing 
petitions to qualify his "Big Green" environmental initiative for the November 
ballot. Among other things, the ballot proposition would establish tanker 
safety standards and impose a new tax on oil to create a $500-million cleanup 
superfund. 
</P>
<P>
"You can do something," he said to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Like other politicians, he also knew that reporters, dozens of them, and their 
score of satellite TV trucks, helicopters, cameras and sound booms, would be 
anxious, to say the least, for deeds to record. 
</P>
<P>
Hold up those petitions for the cameras, they asked him. Here, let us shoot you 
gathering signatures. Please, general, move over closer to the water. There. 
Thanks. No one seemed to mind that the attorney general stood behind a podium 
where the official state seal of Controller Davis was emblazoned. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour took credit for action establishing a center to treat oil-soaked bird 
and sea lions. Wilson re-emphasized his independence from the Bush 
Administration and renewed a call for the President to prohibit offshore oil 
drilling. He also exhorted Congress to act on requiring double-hulled tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and McCarthy spoke as two members of the State Lands Commission, which 
has responsibility for California tidelands. They urged support for state 
Legislation to prepare California for an even larger spill. 
</P>
<P>
They practiced their "sound bites" along the way. "This spill is a wake-up call 
for California," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, Lady Luck has smiled on California," said Davis, referring to the 
fair winds that held the slick offshore. ". . . No one, however, should confuse 
good luck with good planning." 
</P>
<P>
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor Marian Bergeson, who represents 
the Orange County coast in the state Senate, joined the pilgrimage to the 
beach. She vowed to fight any further offshore oil drilling. She also sent a 
shot at rival Seymour for his votes in favor of coastal oil development. 
</P>
<P>
Local Reps. Dana Rohrabacher and C. Christopher Cox, joined by Rep. Mel Levine 
of Santa Monica, came as a delegation, arriving with a showy beachfront 
helicopter landing. 
</P>
<P>
Absent from the spill scene were two California politicians of note. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, Democratic candidate for governor and former mayor of San 
Francisco, thought it would be unseemly to traipse onto the sand. "She doesn't 
hold an office; it's a little difficult for her to claim a platform to speak," 
said aide Dee Dee Myers. "There is nothing worse than standing on the beach 
with your thumbs in your suspenders waiting for someone to ask you a question." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian also stayed away, but probably for different reasons. He 
is California's foremost political champion of coastal oil development. "He 
feels the situation is being capably managed," said Press Secretary Bob Gore.

CHALLENGE LIKELY TODAY ON FCC RACE-PREFERENCE PLAN

The Bush Administration plans a Supreme Court challenge today to the 
constitutionality of a Federal Communications Commission plan that gives 
preference to minorities and women in awarding broadcast licenses, it was 
learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration brief concerns one of two cases that involve FCC 
minority-preference plans. The two cases mark the justices' first look at the 
legality of affirmative-action plans since they struck down a Richmond 
set-aside plan for minority contractors last year. 
</P>
<P>
A brief in the second case, involving an FCC policy giving minority firms first 
chance to obtain the licenses of broadcasters who face revocation of their 
permits, is not due until next month, but the Administration also is expected 
to challenge the constitutionality of that plan, according to sources familiar 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had contended that Supreme Court review of the FCC cases was 
"not warranted at this time" because appeals courts have barely started to 
consider the application of the Richmond ruling to federally sponsored racial 
preference programs. 
</P>
<P>
However, the justices agreed in January to hear the cases, and civil rights 
groups have been waiting to learn the Administration's position. 
</P>
<P>
The case in which the brief is due today, Metro Broadcasting Inc. vs. FCC, 
concerns the FCC's denial of a license to Metro Broadcasting for a television 
station in Orlando, Fla., in favor of a competitor that received "enhancement 
credits" because it was owned by three Latinos. The federal appeals court here 
ruled that the FCC action was justified. 
</P>
<P>
The FCC adopted the preference policy in 1978 following a ruling by the federal 
appeals court here directing the commission to give "favorable consideration" 
to minority-owned applicants. When the FCC sought to reconsider its policy 
during the Reagan Administration, Congress enacted an appropriations rider that 
forbids any changes. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration brief is expected to argue that, although Congress has more 
leeway in adopting racial preference policies than do states or local 
governments, that power does not justify the FCC policy because it was adopted 
by the agency rather than Congress.

The man who slugged Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) during a television interview last 
October was found innocent by reason of insanity Thursday and ordered to 
undergo treatment for mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson ordered Michael Breen, 31, of Washington, to 
remain at an in-patient psychiatric hospital until he can prove in court that 
he does not pose a risk to others. 
</P>
<P>
Breen encountered the senator on Oct. 25 at an outdoor television interview, 
lunged at him from the side and landed a solid right to the jaw. Aside from 
redness and a few days of soreness, Glenn, a 68-year-old ex-Marine, was 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Philip Inglima acknowledged that Breen hit Glenn. The 
altercation was taped by a television camera and broadcast nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
According to the criminal complaint filed against him, Breen told police that 
he was trying to get the attention of Pope John Paul II and prevent a nuclear 
war. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, Breen had been detained by U.S. Capitol Police and the Secret 
Service after breaking through a police line and trying to reach out to Vice 
President Dan Quayle's motorcade, officials said.

BLACK MORTALITY GAP: CAUSES STILL ELUSIVE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: EQUAL INCOMES AND QUALITY MEDICAL CARE WOULD STILL LEAVE MINORITIES 
WITH A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF PREMATURE DEATHS, RESEARCHERS CONCLUDE. 
</P>

<P>
The high rate of premature deaths among black Americans is the result of so 
many different causes that even if high quality health care were equally 
available to whites and blacks and incomes were equal, 31% of the gap would 
remain, according to a study being published today. 
</P>
<P>
In a 13-year survey of some 8,806 black and white adults, researchers at the 
federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta found that just under one-third 
of the difference in death rates between the races -- which are 149% higher for 
blacks between the ages of 35-54 than whites -- can be attributed to the higher 
incidence of preventable risk factors such as high blood pressure, cholesterol 
level, weight, smoking, alcohol intake and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
If blacks and whites were equal in all these risk factors but not in income, 
the study found, 69% of the difference in mortality rate would remain. 
</P>
<P>
Differences in income, the study found, accounted for 38 of those 69 percentage 
points. In other words, if black and white samples were chosen from groups with 
equal incomes, that one factor would erase 38% of the mortality difference. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty, which afflicts blacks disproportionately, is known to limit access to 
health care and, the researchers noted, may contribute to a disease by imposing 
greater stress. 
</P>
<P>
A final 31% of the mortality difference could not be attributed to any known or 
measurable cause. Among such factors are presumed to be differences in 
environment, heredity and life style. 
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., appears to 
complicate the already difficult question of why the health of black Americans 
appears to be steadily deteriorating relative to whites. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1986 -- the last year for which figures are available -- black 
life expectancy declined for the second year in a row, falling to 69.4 years, 
5.4 year less than the average white life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
By giving broad weight to economic factors -- which it says account for 38% of 
the difference in black and white death rates -- and other unknown 
considerations, the study appears to suggest that only part of the solution to 
the mortality gap may lie within the power of the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
"Broader social and health system changes and research targeted at the causes 
of the mortality gap, coupled with increased efforts aimed at modifiable risk 
factors, may all be needed for egalitarian goals in health to be realized," the 
study stated. 
</P>
<P>
The study compared the health profiles and histories of 7,573 whites and 1,233 
blacks taken from health surveys conducted from 1971 to 1975 and then again 
from 1982 through 1984.

RULES FOR FOOD NUTRITION CLAIMS URGED; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE FDA SEEKS TO CURB THE INCREASING USE OF OFTEN UNJUSTIFIED MESSAGES 
PROMOTING THE VALUE OF PRODUCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has proposed a stringent set of rules 
governing the use of health claims on food labels and advertising, ending 
nearly six years of confusion over how companies may promote the health value 
of their products. 
</P>
<P>
By narrowing standards for what is permissible and strengthening the FDA's 
legal authority to act against misleading claims, the rules could curtail a 
trend in food marketing that has resulted in almost 40% of new products and a 
third of the $3.6 billion in food advertising over the last year featuring 
health-related messages. 
</P>
<P>
Most such messages are intended to make the consumer think that eating the 
product will reduce the risk of heart disease or cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which will be published next week in the Federal Register, 
were criticized by food industry officials, who said they would require health 
claims to meet an unrealistic standard of scientific proof and would hinder the 
ability of manufacturers to give consumers new information about nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
But several consumer activists and nutritionists, who have been fighting for a 
clarification of the federal position on health claims for food, welcomed the 
proposals, which they said make it easier for consumers to make intelligent 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
Federal policy on health claims has been in limbo since 1984, when Kellogg's 
placed a message on its All Bran cereal noting the scientific evidence linking 
a high fiber diet to a reduction in colon cancer. Although the move was in 
apparent defiance of a longstanding FDA rule prohibiting all health-related 
messages on food products, the agency did not act. 
</P>
<P>
Under mounting pressure from industry, the FDA abandoned its rule in 1987, 
moving to fairly liberal regulations that permitted a variety of health claims, 
provided they had some scientific support. 
</P>
<P>
But those rules made enforcement difficult and allowed what then-FDA 
Commissioner Frank E. Young last year referred to as "overly broad or otherwise 
unjustified" messages. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals represent a compromise between the two positions. In the spirit 
of the original agency position, all health messages are formally banned. Under 
that ban, however, the agency has six exemptions, which it says are so 
well-supported by evidence that agency action is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a high fiber cereal that contains a message stating that high 
fiber diets can reduce the risk of heart disease would be allowed. Other 
permissible links are those between fiber and the reduced risk of colon cancer, 
fat and cancer, fat and heart disease, sodium and hypertension, and calcium and 
reduced risk of osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for these exemptions, a company must first submit its proposed 
health message for agency review and must back its petition with "publicly 
available scientific evidence" that is supported by a "significant agreement" 
among qualified experts.

FELON CONVICTED OF ILLEGALLY POSSESSING GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A convicted felon suspected of selling guns to street gang members and drug 
dealers was found guilty in Los Angeles federal court Thursday of 10 counts of 
illegally possessing firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the trial tied Willie Edward Harris, 47, to the sale of a gun that 
was used in a drug-related murder in 1988, according to Inglewood police. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his conviction on the 10 charges of being a felon in possession of 
firearms, Harris was found guilty of possession of nearly 300 rounds of 
ammunition. Each of the 11 convictions carries a maximum prison sentence of up 
to 10 years. He was acquitted on three counts of illegally possessing firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony in the trial indicated that Harris, who had previously been convicted 
of three felonies involving firearms, used women acquaintances to legally 
purchase handguns which he in turn sold. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony indicated that Harris sold the weapons at weekend gun shows and to 
individuals who gave him money to obtain the firearms, according to Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Jeffrey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Police Detective Russ Enyeart told The Times that a pair of convicted 
armed robbers on parole used a gun traced to Harris in a drug-connected murder 
in Inglewood in May, 1988. Enyeart said that a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun used in the killing was traced to Jacqueline Anderson, who had bought 
it for Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Enyeart said Harris admitted selling the gun, but denied that he sold it to 
either of the men who subsequently pleaded guilty to the Inglewood murder. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is scheduled to be sentenced April 23 and is free on an unsecured 
$10,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
Federal firearms agents arrested Harris in December in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' firearms dealings have been a focus of interest of federal and local 
law enforcement officers for years. He was arrested May 5, 1985, by Pomona 
police for illegally selling a handgun at a gun show at the Los Angeles County 
Fairgrounds, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police found that Harris had been convicted of assault with a deadly 
weapon involving a pistol in 1978. He had also been convicted of lewd acts with 
a child under 14 in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police served a search warrant on Harris' home in Los Angeles and 
discovered two more handguns, a blackjack and a billy club. Harris subsequently 
pleaded no contest to three counts of a felon in possession of firearms and two 
counts of possession of illegal weapons, all felonies. He was placed on 
unsupervised probation. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Harris was under suspicion by federal authorities and Los 
Angeles police of selling weapons to street gang members and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Harris subsequently agreed to cooperate with federal authorities investigating 
another case involving guns being smuggled out of the country, authorities 
said. But Harris allegedly maintained his own gun trafficking operations even 
as he cooperated with authorities, according to federal agents.

POP STAR AND WRITER IN DISCORD OVER SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop singer-composer Stevie Wonder, accused in a lawsuit of stealing the song "I 
Just Called to Say I Love You," testified Thursday in federal court that he got 
the idea for the hit tune in 1976 while being driven to a hotel in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder, 39, who is in the Songwriters' Hall of Fame and has sold millions of 
records, said he created "enough of a working idea for a verse and a chorus" 
during the ride to make a recording of the song the same day -- but that he 
changed the tune over the years and did not record its final version until 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
In a $25-million copyright infringement lawsuit filed in Los Angeles, 
songwriter Lloyd Chiate claims that Wonder pilfered a song that Chiate had 
written in 1976 and converted it into the tune that won a Grammy Award and an 
Academy Award in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Chiate, 40, is a successful songwriter in his own right who has written for the 
Fifth Dimension, Billy Davis Jr., Marilyn McCoo, Eddie Money and Wonder 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder, the first witness called to the stand, said he had left his mother's 
home in the San Fernando Valley and was on his way to Hollywood when the song 
came to him. 
</P>
<P>
The blind singer, who was born Stevland Morris, acknowledged under oath that 
"various things changed throughout the years" on the song, as they frequently 
do when he is working on one. 
</P>
<P>
"I never completed the song," Wonder said, in response to questioning from 
Chiate's lawyer Herbert Dodell. "I never felt it was complete until I recorded 
it in 1984." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black-and-brown checked jacket and turtleneck sweater and with his 
hair tied in a ponytail, Wonder compared his song-writing process to the way a 
painter creates a painting. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dodell presented a different account in his opening statement 
Wednesday before U.S. District Judge David W. Williams. The case is being heard 
by a six-member jury. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said Chiate and a partner, Lee Garrett, composed a song called 
"Hello It's Me, I Just Called to Say" in 1976 that is "strikingly similar" to 
Wonder's hit. 
</P>
<P>
Dodell said that Garrett, an old friend of Wonder's who also is blind, played a 
tape of the song for Wonder in 1977 after Wonder stopped a depressed Garrett 
from committing suicide. Asked about the incident Thursday, Wonder said he 
"honestly" could not remember what was discussed that day. 
</P>
<P>
Chiate and Garrett registered a song called "I Just Called to Say" with 
Broadcast Music Inc. in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
They sued Wonder in 1985, but Garrett dropped out of the lawsuit a year later. 
Dodell said Garrett had made a deal with Wonder in which he gave him a license 
to use the song "I Just Called to Say" in return for money and musical 
equipment. Garrett is expected to testify for Wonder at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Dodell pressed Wonder on a letter that Wonder supposedly wrote to the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1984 using the name Stevland Morris. The 
letter states that Wonder wrote the song in 1984, making it eligible for an 
Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder denied writing the letter. He said it had been written by a lawyer who 
no longer represents him. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder is scheduled to resume his testimony today.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONTROVERSIAL CONTRACT FOR EX-RTD DIRECTOR 
CANCELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The controversial $99,500 consulting contract that had been used to hire former 
Rapid Transit District board member Jan Hall as a district lobbyist was 
canceled Thursday by the board. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-1 vote terminated the contract negotiated in January by RTD Executive 
Director Alan F. Pegg with CBC, a South Bay consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
The firm had hired Hall immediately after the contract was signed. She left the 
board to take the lobbyist's job. 
</P>
<P>
Pegg's unusual move, which RTD lawyers said was legal, sidestepped the 
district's revolving-door policy preventing directors from going to work for 
the district for a year after their term expires or they resign. The contract 
drew a storm of protest when news of it became public. 
</P>
<P>
After canceling the contract, the board adopted a more specific policy 
prohibiting hiring an ex-director directly or through a second-party contract.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN WOULD BREAK SCHOOL DISTRICT INTO 8 NEW 
ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Advocates of breaking up the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District said 
Thursday that it could be divided into eight separate districts along current 
administrative boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Wilcox, an aide to state Assemblywoman Marian LaFollette (R-Northridge), 
told a news conference at district offices in Van Nuys that each of the 
district's eight regions would have enough students and facilities to operate 
as an independent school district. 
</P>
<P>
Dividing the Los Angeles district by existing regions would create two 
districts in the Valley, as well as districts in the Harbor, 
Westside/Hollywood, downtown, Eastside, south and southeast areas. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox is executive director of an advisory committee LaFollette created to 
study breaking up the district, the nation's second largest.

SUIT AIMS AT TEENS' VANDALISM; 
</P>
<P>
GRAFFITI: PARENTS OF YOUTHS ACCUSED OF USING GLASS CUTTERS TO MARK WINDOWS AND 
MIRRORS AT A TORRANCE MALL COULD BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES. SEVEN BOYS ARE ACCUSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new rash of graffiti in the South Bay that cannot be scrubbed off, painted 
over or otherwise cleaned up has prompted a Torrance mall to file a lawsuit 
against the accused teen-age vandals, who allegedly used glass cutters to 
deface windows and mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the Del Amo Fashion Center filed a lawsuit last week in Torrance 
Superior Court that demands a total of $50,000 in damages from seven teen-age 
boys accused of scratching graffiti onto glass surfaces at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for The Torrance Co., which owns the shopping center, said he will try 
to collect damages from the boys' parents, invoking a portion of the state 
Civil Code that says parents can be held liable for their children's misdeeds. 
Each family could be liable for up to $10,000, said the company's lawyer, 
Daniel B. Diederich. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Del Amo is one of several South Bay malls that teen-agers have 
"tagged" -- or scrawled with their nicknames. The Galleria at South Bay in 
Redondo Beach and the Hawthorne Plaza Mall have also been hit by the vandals, 
who are not gang members, police and mall managers said. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of "tagging" has become more costly lately because the vandals 
have forsaken spray paint for glass cutters in an attempt to leave more 
permanent markings, said Ken Poole of The Torrance Co. 
</P>
<P>
"They are just telling their friends that they have been by," Poole said. "It's 
an expensive way to do that and we would certainly hope they would find a 
better way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The company has already spent more than $10,000 replacing some of the mall's 
exterior glass walls and interior mirrors, Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
A mall security guard caught one of the teen-agers in December as he was 
scratching his nickname on restroom mirrors at the mall's Aladdin Arcade, a 
popular hangout for young people, Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager identified several other youths who had been leaving their marks 
around the mall. One particularly prevalent mark was "D.I.S.," apparently 
standing for "Dissidents in Society," Torrance police said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven boys, ages 15 to 17, are named in the lawsuit. Three youths also face 
criminal charges filed by the Torrance Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges and increased patrols by mall security officers have 
nearly eliminated the vandalism, Poole said. Most of the damaged glass and 
mirrors have already been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Bishop, manager of Galleria at South Bay, said the Redondo Beach mall 
suffered about $2,000 in damage this winter to restroom mirrors. Bishop said 
the string of mirror scratchings ended when mall security officers increased 
patrols and confronted teen-age mall employees suspected of the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
The J. C. Penney department store at Hawthorne Plaza suffered repeated damage 
to its exterior glass walls last year, mall manager Bill Demarest said. But the 
problem ended when the store replaced several panes of glass with wood 
paneling. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop said the Del Amo mall's lawsuit should serve as an additional deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is out there now," Bishop said, "that if you are caught, not only 
will the individual be in trouble, but we'll go after the parents too."

SUSPECT IN L.A. DRIVE-BY SHOOTING IN 1988 KILLED IN LOUISIANA; 
</P>
<P>
GANGS: KILLINGS IN SHREVEPORT HAVE BEEN ON THE RISE. THE LATEST FATALITY IS 
SEEN AS ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT THE VIOLENCE MAY HAVE ITS ORIGINS IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA . 
</P>

<P>
The latest fatality in escalating gang violence in Shreveport, La., has been 
identified as a 24-year-old Los Angeles man who had been sought by police as a 
suspect in a 1988 drive-by murder in the South-Central Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, police said, the suspect, Larry Alonzo Winters, had been 
living in Shreveport under the name "Dante Ford," becoming one of the leaders 
of a Crips faction whose war with another gang is believed responsible for 
scores of drive-by shootings. Twelve people have been shot in the last week, 
five wounded in separate incidents on Monday alone. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, Shreveport police said, a man identified as Ford was shot 
through the heart by a 9-millimeter round fired from a passing Cadillac. A 
15-year-old boy, standing nearby in front of a gang hangout, was wounded in the 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Thursday that a fingerprint check and a records search through 
the Los Angeles police gang computer determined that the dead man was Winters 
-- a member of the 52nd Street Hoover Crips. 
</P>
<P>
Winters, police said, was the chief suspect in the 1988 Halloween night killing 
of a rival gang member and the wounding of four others in South-Central Los 
Angeles. "What goes around comes around," Los Angeles Police Detective Erin 
Brown said of Winters' death. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities theorized that Winters, an escapee from a California Juvenile 
Corrections facility, fled to Shreveport soon after the shooting in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For officials in Shreveport, it was additional evidence of the importation of 
gang problems from Southern California. Although gang members from Los Angeles 
have been occasionally found there over the last several years, authorities in 
the northern Louisiana oil city debated for a year or so whether groups calling 
themselves Bloods and Crips were offshoots of Los Angeles gangs or local youths 
imitating characters in the movie "Colors." 
</P>
<P>
Last March, however, four teen-agers were wounded in a drive-by shooting and, 
by the end of 1989, several drive-bys were being reported each week. In 
December, a 19-year-old man became the first fatality, shot down while leaving 
the local hangout of the Rolling 60s faction of the Crips. Police said the 
Hoover Crips -- of which Winters was a leader -- were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The drive-by incidents became more frequent last month -- seven reported in one 
three-day period. Also in January, $1 million worth of crack cocaine was 
discovered in a Federal Express packet sent from Los Angeles to Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the shootings have been over control of drug-selling areas, 
police said, most are for revenge, "tit-for-tat stuff," Shreveport Detective 
Don Ashley said. "They're been warring back and forth for some time, but it has 
escalated." 
</P>
<P>
"We always had known known him by his nickname, 'Bam,' " Ashley said of 
Winters. "People had been talking about him for a year." 
</P>
<P>
Police are on the alert for more shootings in the wake of his killing, Ashley 
said.

Sheriff's deputies are investigating allegations that a group of neo-Nazi 
"skinheads" in Temple City may have been responsible for burning a tiny wooden 
cross Thursday on the lawn of a neighboring black family. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer Stewart and his wife, Patricia, both RTD bus drivers, said their eldest 
child was leaving for school about 8:30 a.m. when he spotted the charred cross, 
about nine inches high, on their lawn. The cross appeared to be made of 
miniature toy Lincoln Logs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a peaceful person," Spencer Stewart, 41, said. "But I feel now that my 
home front is in danger." 
</P>
<P>
The family, which has lived in the predominantly Anglo community for about a 
year, told police that they had recently noticed several young men, who often 
wore swastikas and combat boots, living nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they went to the home on East Longden Avenue described by the 
Stewarts and found a set of the toy logs. The police confiscated several of the 
wooden pieces and took them to the sheriff's crime lab to determine whether 
they are of the same brand found on the Stewarts' lawn. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident, including the people living in that house, are under 
investigation," said Lt. Phil Bullington of the sheriff's Temple City 
substation. "But so far we haven't found anyone, including those people, who 
claim to have any knowledge of this." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, three men, all in their early 20s, identified themselves as 
"skinheads" to a reporter who visited the home where police confiscated the toy 
set. The men said they follow neo-Nazi ideology, but deny any involvement in 
the cross-burning. 
</P>
<P>
It was the county's first reported cross-burning of the year, according to 
officials for the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. In 1988, there 
were 267 hate crimes reported, including three cross-burnings. Last year's 
figures are not yet available, but the commission's executive director, Eugene 
Mornell, said the numbers will probably reflect an increase. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred one block away from the scene of what commission 
officials say was one of the most notorious hate crimes that occurred since the 
county began keeping records a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, 1980, during the celebration of Hanukkah, an arson fire swept 
through Temple Beth David in the 9600 block of East Longden Avenue, causing 
more than $100,000 in damage. Michael Steven Canale and Donald Nielson, both 
self-professed members of the American Nazi Party, later were convicted of 
setting the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City, a community of 30,000 people in the western San Gabriel Valley, 
has about 135 black residents. Of the 4,330 students in the Temple City Unified 
School District, 43 are black -- and three of those are the Stewarts' children. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, however, they said they had never felt any animosity. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my kids that these are people with sick minds," Patricia Stewart, 32, 
said. "Just pray for them when you say your prayers at night."

AT MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE, SEXISM PUTS TRADITIONAL GREEK HOUSES ON THE ROPES

MIDDLEBURY, Vt. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may be no more idyllic spot in all of higher education than Middlebury 
College. Students here boast, with little exaggeration, that they select their 
rooms based on whether they want to gaze upon the Green Mountains to the east 
or the Adirondacks in the west. 
</P>
<P>
Filled with majestic, Colonial buildings of white marble and pale gray 
limestone, the campus is quintessentially New England -- with the exception of 
its flashy sports facilities. The academically selective school has its own 
alpine ski slopes. A state-of-the-art indoor fitness center. An 18-hole golf 
course. And more. 
</P>
<P>
But despite post card-perfect scenes of "Club Midd" students merrily shredding 
the ski runs and skating pond, winter has not been entirely cool at Middlebury. 
According to administrators, faculty and students, the school is in the midst 
of a red-hot debate over the imminent demise of a 149-year-old tradition. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 13, the school's board of trustees ordered Middlebury's six 
fraternities to pledge women by the end of the year or cease existing at the 
college. (Middlebury has no sororities. They reportedly died out amid civil 
rights and Vietnam War protests of the '60s.) 
</P>
<P>
The decree that women be integrated into fraternities -- sparked by some 
misogynist high jinks at a Middlebury frat house in 1988 -- is considered a 
serious threat to the school's unique, somewhat laissez-faire social structure. 
</P>
<P>
It may also portend more trouble for fraternities nationwide. Most observers 
agree that the Greek system -- inspiration for such films as "Animal House" and 
"Revenge of the Nerds" -- has made a strong comeback from membership drop-offs 
of the late '60s and early '70s. But fraternities, in particular, continue to 
be plagued by allegations of racism, concern over alcohol and drug abuse, and 
increasingly, suggestions that they condone sexist behavior and perpetuate, if 
not promote, sexual stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Middlebury's mandate is just the latest development from New England, seedbed 
of a small but growing movement to sexually integrate fraternities or abolish 
them completely. Already, Greek letter societies have been outlawed at such 
respected Northeastern liberal arts colleges as Amherst and Williams in 
Massachusetts and Colby in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
But Middlebury appears to be spearheading a countertrend: an attempt to reform 
rather than eradicate its fraternities. Similar efforts are also under way at 
Maine's Bowdoin College, which has given fraternities until September, 1991, to 
pledge female members. At Connecticut's Wesleyan University, all-male 
organizations are being strongly encouraged to admit women but haven't been 
threatened with sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Some co-ed fraternities exist on West Coast campuses, but integrating 
single-sex groups hasn't been much of an issue here, reports Ken Taylor, 
director of residential and Greek life at the USC. "I'm not aware of 
discussions about it . . . ," says Taylor, "or of a serious intent on the part 
of any (West Coast) school to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Middlebury already has a progressive reputation with regard to 
Greek houses, and a precedent-setting history on integration issues. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1800, it was the nation's first institution of higher education to 
graduate a black student (1823). It was the first to award a black an honorary 
degree (1804). Back in the late 1940s, Middlebury fraternities challenged their 
national organizations and pledged both a black (Charles A. James, a former U.S 
ambassador to Niger) and a Jew (Felix Rohatyn, a nationally known New York 
financier). 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, Middlebury's Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter pledged Ron Brown, the black 
man who is now chairman of the Democratic National Committee. In so doing, the 
chapter lost its ties with its national organization and renamed itself Sigma 
Epsilon. 
</P>
<P>
The latest move by the trustees -- which has been called a "creative, 
innovative" solution by Middlebury president Olin Robison -- charts middle 
ground between two opposing campus views: * The recent majority report of a 
Middlebury task force on student social life, which recommended fraternities be 
totally abolished so that a contemporary social structure could be created 
without ancient Greek baggage. "As society has changed, fraternities have not, 
and therefore have become an anachronism," the report maintains. "A narrowly 
defined, fraternity-dominated social life on campus is incompatible with our 
vision of the future." 
</P>
<P>
* The students' decidedly pro-Greek wishes. Though only 14% of Middlebury's 
approximately 2,000 students are fraternity members, 68% of them favor keeping 
fraternities, according to a survey of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on the toga party that went too far. Though there have been other 
reports of sexist behavior at Middlebury, just about everybody at the school 
says the catalyst for the trustees' decision was the 1988 toga party hosted by 
Delta Upsilon. 
</P>
<P>
DU is the campus' reigning jock frat and includes among its members the 
captains of the football, hockey, basketball, baseball, golf, lacrosse and 
track teams. At the annual toga party, the torso of a female mannequin was hung 
from a balcony of the fraternity house. The dummy was splattered with red 
paint, resembling blood. And the mannequin was labeled with a phrase that 
suggested its availability for sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
Women attending the party remained despite the dummy's presence. Some say they 
didn't even notice it. But the college's admittedly small but vocal band of 
feminists did more than see it. They alerted television camera crews in 
Burlington, Vermont's largest city, 45 minutes to the north. Public 
embarrassment continued with national newspaper coverage. In addition, the 
feminists and others who were outraged staged a protest demonstration in which 
an estimated 50 people participated. 
</P>
<P>
DU members were barred from living in their house for a year, but continued to 
hold Thursday night meetings in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Some members are now back in their frat house but they are forbidden to have 
parties while still on probation. Like other Middlebury fraternities, DU has 
until the end of March to state its intention or non-intention to comply with 
the order to pledge women. DU president Jim Boyle, who is also the captain of 
Middlebury's football team, says the members still haven't decided on their 
official response to the trustees' decision. 
</P>
<P>
One might expect Boyle and his brothers to welcome the notion of female members 
with a hearty, "bring on the babes" attitude. But DU, as part of its reparation 
and service to the college, has sponsored numerous "gender-awareness" programs 
since the party incident. Boyle's words appear to be carefully chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"There certainly was an incidence of abuse on our campus," he acknowledges, 
sitting in a sparsely furnished, one-time party room at the DU house. 
</P>
<P>
"But we feel strongly that fraternities have been wrongly construed to be the 
cause of this (sexism)," Boyle continues. "You're just as likely to see sexist 
acts in residence halls as fraternities. We know a lot of things occur at the 
school and they're non-issues. When they occur in a fraternity, they're 
fraternity problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the mandate is the product of an incorrect equation: the feminist 
movement equals the civil rights movement and integration is the way to step 
forward. I think there are differences between men and women and that 
(single-sex organizations) should be an option. We feel it's completely natural 
and absolutely fine for one sex to want to live in a house together. . . . It 
will be extremely difficult to get the (DU international) to consider it 
(changing their constitution to admit women). Most nationals feel that the 
schools in the Northeast are out of step (in requiring that fraternities go 
co-ed)." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle's reference to the "extremely difficult" part is a comment on another 
portion of the Middlebury trustees' mandate -- that local houses not only 
pledge women members, but also get their nationals to approve the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees have given campus frat houses until Dec. 31 to persuade their 
respective national or international organizations to change their policies 
prohibiting women members. If the locals fail to get their 
national/international constitutions altered, they must drop their Greek 
letters and drop their ties with the parent associations. 
</P>
<P>
Many Greeks both on and off campus say that task is next to impossible. As any 
faithful alum will attest, fraternities and sororities are repositories of 
tradition rivaling churches, Elks Club lodges and the Boy Scouts. Changing 
constitutions and bylaws to sexually integrate a national fraternity -- one of 
the last sanctioned male bastions in the United States -- might be considered 
as probable as the Catholic church deciding to ordain women priests. 
</P>
<P>
Already, one national fraternity says it plans to disenfranchise its Middlebury 
local for having pledged two women. 
</P>
<P>
"Laws are laws," insists Donald Stohl, executive director at Kappa Delta Rho's 
national headquarters in Greensburg, Pa., referring to the fact that 
Middlebury's KDR chapter pledged two women in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"They violated the law which states that we are a single-sex organization. They 
didn't ask us. They just went ahead. Even though the school has taken this 
action, we have no choice. We're going to go ahead and sever relations." 
</P>
<P>
In one breath, Boyle says he would like to see the DU international office file 
a class-action suit against Middlebury on the grounds that the college is 
restricting students' freedom of association. Then, with less enthusiasm, he 
describes the most likely and immediate scenario: "We're going to consider the 
(trustees') proposal. I imagine we'll lobby the national to allow women to 
join. We don't feel it will radically alter the fraternity system." 
</P>
<P>
(Steven Gerber, executive director of DU international, says he cannot respond 
to the Middlebury mandate because he has yet to see anything in writing 
regarding its details. For the international fraternity to change its 
constitution, he adds, "we would have to go to our annual leadership conference 
in August, which is made up of undergraduates from all over. It would have to 
be a decision of all chapters." Other national headquarters' executives have 
also indicated they are still considering the Middlebury situation as well and 
have not yet arrived at a formal response.) 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, if Middlebury's fraternity members fail to satisfy the 
trustees' mandate, it appears they will have to abandon their houses as all but 
one are owned by the college. All but a few Middlebury students are required to 
live on campus and their annual $19,000 fees for tuition, room and board are 
the same whether they live in dorms or frat houses. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, since 1980 Middlebury students have been been allowed to join any 
fraternity on campus -- theoretically at least. The school's "open rush" rules 
permit that any individual of any race, creed, sex, looks, income, upbringing, 
weight, wardrobe or social circle can pledge the fraternity of his or her 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, this self-selection process has been largely a joke, working much 
like the traditional blackball system it was designed to replace. Students at 
Middlebury point out that they are sophisticated enough to read subtle (or 
blatant) signals and won't join an organization in which they know they are not 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, these students claim there are many incentives at Middlebury for 
not pledging. Non-Greeks are always welcome at fraternity parties, to which 
tickets are reportedly sold in a non-discriminatory fashion. And many 
independents here feel they have the best of both worlds. They can socialize at 
the frats but aren't required to be at parties (as members usually are). They 
don't have to work at the events or clean up after them the next day. And they 
don't have to pay dues. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of noise. And the houses smell like beer halls. I wouldn't want 
to live there," says Laura Rude, who, with Mimi Gottesfeld, nonetheless are the 
only current female members of a Middlebury fraternity. The two women, who 
enjoy being called "brothers," pledged Kappa Delta Rho in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
(Middlebury Sigma Epsilon president Lowrey Sullivan notes that in 1983 half of 
the members of his currently all-male fraternity were women, and there was a 
female president of the house in the late '70s.) 
</P>
<P>
Like many members of frat houses with not enough room for all their members, 
Rude and Gottesfeld live in co-ed dormitories. Both are law school-bound 
seniors and say they joined Kappa Delta Rho because of so many pals there, 
friends who assured them there were only two or three KDR brothers against 
their pledging in a fraternity of 45 members. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Middlebury fraternity that claims to have a thoroughly 
pro-women-members policy is previously integrated Sig Ep. Its members say they 
have sincerely encouraged women to join their ranks but haven't succeeded 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
And the other houses? None has an official policy yet. Some brothers are 
adamantly in favor of preserving the status quo and insist their all-male 
enclaves will continue -- underground if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Others say they prefer remaining all-male but will attempt to comply with the 
trustees' decision. And a few of the fraternity men claim to reluctantly favor 
the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Interfraternity Council President John DeMatte, for instance, says he is 
relieved by the trustees' compromise position, but doubts its effectiveness 
against sexism and alcohol abuse: "You have no idea how close we (fraternities) 
came to being abolished. Fraternities are the most picked-on organizations on 
the campus. Fraternities are not the root of sexism. Abolishing the 
fraternities or making them admit women would be like attacking a weed with a 
weed eater. Its roots still remain and it will continue to live." 
</P>
<P>
"I was walking on campus one night about a year ago with another woman when we 
passed a group of men, some of whom were wearing fraternity insignia," recalls 
Antonia de Vegh, co-president of Middlebury's Women's Union, a feminist 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"They yelled, 'OK, girls, grasp your ankles and bend over.' This is an attitude 
for which they had no remorse or embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
De Vegh is telling her story at the weekly meeting of campus feminists held in 
an upstairs room of the same building that houses the student cafeteria. Five 
women are in attendance and the meeting has become a group interview. 
</P>
<P>
Similar stories are repeated. Because of such incidents and others of a more 
subtle nature, the women all say that they and most other members of 
Middlebury's feminist network favor complete abolition of fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Not that these women attend many of their functions. Most of those at the 
meeting visited fraternity parties as freshmen but didn't care for the 
experience. De Vegh mainly remembers the event she attended as "boring -- 
everybody was pop-eyed drunk." 
</P>
<P>
"The trustees' decision in no way recognizes or addresses the racist, sexist 
and hetero-sexist history of the fraternity system," she claims. "It is a 
concession, but it's certainly not going to change the attitudes engendered at 
fraternities. I'm not saying that every member of a fraternity is a sexist, but 
if fraternities were abolished, the attitudes that exist there would no longer 
be institutionalized." 
</P>
<P>
Though she prefers getting rid of fraternities to reforming them, Lisa Van 
Buren, co-president of the Women's Union, says she understands why some people 
think forcing sexual integration is a step toward ending sexism: 
</P>
<P>
"If women lived there, the activities wouldn't all be male dominated. Most 
students at Middlebury support keeping the fraternities because they don't see 
a better alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its lavish sporting facilities, the school does not have a student 
union. Construction on a planned student facility has been repeatedly delayed, 
with groundbreaking scheduled to begin in the spring. Even Middlebury president 
Robison concedes that if collegiate social life is defined narrowly in terms of 
large weekend parties, there would be little social life at Middlebury if 
fraternities were not there to organize it. 
</P>
<P>
Rude and Gottesfeld, the women who have chosen not only to socialize at their 
favorite fraternity but also join it, say they haven't experienced sexism at 
Kappa Delta Rho. 
</P>
<P>
"Laura and I weren't setting out to prove anything," Gottesfeld insists. "It 
was a sincere gesture of friendship. I love that place. I love the people 
there. The women making the biggest hue and cry about this are the ones who 
never go (to fraternity parties). They're generalizing because they have little 
knowledge of the situation. It's not fair to the fraternities." 
</P>
<P>
Rude, who's been enclosing press clips about pledging KDR with law school 
applications as a way to set herself apart from the crowd, adds that even her 
experience as a pledge was non-sexist. 
</P>
<P>
"During pledging, you're on call, 24 hours a day for six weeks," she explains. 
"Brothers will call you at 2 in the morning saying, 'We're hungry. Go get us 
food.' We had to do their laundry. But everyone did. It wasn't like, 'You're a 
girl. Do this laundry.' There were a few things that were questionable: 
'Everybody get into your boxer shorts, run around and do this.' But they made 
allowances for us on that. There was nothing degrading to women. And now that 
I'm a brother, I have a pledge doing my laundry, too." 
</P>
<P>
Just about everybody at Middlebury has a fierce opinion about what to do with 
the Greeks. But one of the most measured views comes from a fraternity member 
who suspects the school would be better off without its fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, blond, legally blind senior Ad Hardin is a member of Sigma Epsilon, the 
fraternity noted for its many skiers, soccer players and "Dead Heads" (Grateful 
Dead fans). A senior in an independent scholar program on Latin American 
studies, Hardin is also the editor of The Middlebury Campus, the college's 
weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Middlebury is a small school that I don't think needs organizations like 
fraternities," he says. "Fraternities do promote sexism. When you get a bunch 
of guys by themselves, most of whom have been brought up to think it's OK to 
make sexist remarks and to view women as somewhat one-dimensional, that tends 
to feed on itself. It lets that attitude insulate itself from other elements 
that would challenge it." 
</P>
<P>
So how did a Greek who personally prefers wiping out Middlebury frats respond 
on his paper's editorial page? 
</P>
<P>
Hardin, who has been critical of other policies at Middlebury, termed the 
trustees' decision "productively conciliatory." And he wrote that although 
"some brothers would argue that the decision does effectively abolish 
fraternities, the fact is that a group of friends can still organize themselves 
around a residence." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hardin observed that the ruling is hardly a final, comprehensive 
blueprint for social life at Middlebury College. "It is more along the lines of 
a rough outline, with many blanks to be filled in." 
</P>
<P>
Blanks indeed. Right now, no one at Middlebury knows precisely how a fraternity 
will be judged to have complied with the trustees' wishes. Fifty percent women? 
As many as will pledge? A few to indicate sincerity and improvement? 
</P>
<P>
According to several Middlebury administrators, about the only thing that's 
agreed upon is that nobody wants to establish a quota system for female 
membership in fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Says Dean of the College Ann Craig Hanson, who spent much of the last year 
overseeing the task force on student social life, "Now the work really begins."

A LOOK AT HOW SOME HOUSES WENT CO-ED 
</P>

<P>
Although no one knows precisely how long members of the opposite sex have 
secretly resided at fraternity or sorority houses, some Greek-letter societies 
formally went co-ed back in the 1960s, says the organizer of a network of co-ed 
fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
"The first co-ed fraternity I know of was Pi Alpha Tau, founded in 1962 at the 
University of Chicago. It was called a 'fratority' and founded by Gaylord Cox, 
who had been a member of Theta Zsi," says Jeff Heofand, a senior at Bradley 
University in Peoria, Ill., who created Pi Delta Chi, a co-ed fraternity at 
Bradley, in 1987. Heofand is organizing an association for such groups. 
</P>
<P>
"From my research, I'm guessing there are about 400 local co-ed college 
fraternities in the United States. Most of them are not really affiliated with 
anyone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some fraternities affiliated with national organizations covertly have 
women members, adds Heofand. "I haven't researched it in the Western United 
States, but in the East it's very popular for (allegedly all-male) fraternities 
to have women members. They just don't tell their national organizations about 
it," he says, referring to the fact that most national constitutions and bylaws 
specifically forbid women members. 
</P>
<P>
But a few integrated local chapters do, in fact, tell their national 
organizations that they have female members and exceptions are sometimes made, 
Heofand says. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some national fraternities, such as Psi Upsilon, have changed 
their constitutions to accept women members. 
</P>
<P>
Says Jonathan J. Brant, executive director of the National Interfraternity 
Conference: "Last year we surveyed our member fraternities. There are 59 of 
them. Five of them responded that their constitutions were not gender-specific, 
and that their membership was open to (any) students in good standing. Three of 
those five indicated that they have one or more women on their official 
membership roles." BETH ANN KRIER

FOR THE OLDER WOMAN, A BRUSHUP ON MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE-MARIE TURK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Makeup artist Margaret Avery dips into a big tote bag and pulls out her most 
precious tools: brushes of all sizes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the first thing a woman should own. Of course, not everyone needs 31," 
she notes after a quick count of her collection. 
</P>
<P>
Avery gets her brushes in art supply stores (the average woman buys hers at a 
cosmetics counter), and they have been skillfully flicked over the skin and 
bones of Hollywood screen stars, top fashion models and even First Lady Barbara 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
It was Avery who emphasized Mrs. Bush's cheekbones, played up her lips and 
played down her foundation for a flattering Time magazine cover portrait in 
1989 that ran with the headline, "The Silver Fox." 
</P>
<P>
The New-York-based specialist believes in the less-is-more school of makeup, 
and she says she did for Barbara Bush what she would do for any "older women" 
(that means over 40). She kept the foundation very pale so it wouldn't look 
heavy. She applied a dark-brown cream blusher, rather than red, for a more 
natural look. And she accentuated the First Lady's cheekbones with a 
peach-colored blusher, applied in a stroke that went from nose to hairline. 
</P>
<P>
To play up Mrs. Bush's "beautifully shaped mouth," she used a honey-brown 
foundation to soften a raspberry-colored lipstick worn over it. 
</P>
<P>
Avery's own mouth is splashed with a vivid red lip color. It is a matte shade, 
which she prefers to anything frosted for herself (she is 38) and more mature 
women. She explains that "frosted colors on older women tend to make the skin 
look puffy and more wrinkled." 
</P>
<P>
For a makeover on Helen Wasylciw, an attractive gray-haired woman who prefers 
no makeup, Avery applied a light layer of foundation and worked mostly around 
the eyes, explaining, "Her eyes droop a bit at the outer corners. Anyone with 
that problem should never use dark eye shadow or extend the eye shadow beyond 
the edge of the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Avery finds the two biggest makeup mistakes made by older women are: "wearing 
too much and not learning how to blend it so it looks as if they have barely 
any on." She strongly recommends women of any age wear a moisturizer and a sun 
block under makeup. 
</P>
<P>
A fan of drugstore cosmetics, Avery used several for her makeovers, including 
Complex 15 moisturizer (for which she recently toured the United States, 
stopping briefly in Los Angeles) and Cover Girl mascara. But when she wants an 
instant pick-me-up, she treats herself to an expensive lipstick or eye shadow 
(Prescriptives is a favorite brand). Or a new compact. To have that ritzy 
little object in her handbag, she says, "is like wearing a gorgeous lacy bra."

LINING UP TO MASTER THE LAMBADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, Heckman is a Calabasas free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picture this: You're in a ballroom dance class, just finishing up a twirl 
through a fox trot and maybe a meringue or two. Across the floor is the most 
attractive person you've ever seen, and you'd love to wrap your arms. . . 
</P>
<P>
But, wait! The music starts and -- what's that? It's the Lambada, the sexy new 
body-to-body dance from Brazil. All right! What a way to get to know somebody. 
</P>
<P>
The jury may still be out on whether the Lambada is going to be a fleeting 
comet or a high-magnitude new star, but ballroom dancers and instructors have 
already reached a verdict. For them, it's the real stuff, the first couples 
dance in years that has brought students pouring into dance studios. 
</P>
<P>
The fascination with choreography that places dancers in tight, body-to-body 
contact has increased, if anything, since the dance arrived from Brazil last 
autumn after a detour through Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Lambada, as a highly visible media phenomenon, may indeed turn out to have 
little more than the Andy Warhol-prescribed 15 minutes of fame. But as a social 
dance, say the instructors, it's here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The impact on Southland classes in the last two months has been dramatic. Felix 
Chavez, perhaps the Southland's most visible Lambada instructor, just added his 
fourth weekly class on the Lambada, up from one last fall, at his Warner Dance 
Center West in Woodland Hills. One of the sessions -- on Wednesday nights -- is 
especially slanted toward beginning students. 
</P>
<P>
"If the response I'm seeing in my classes is any indication," said Chavez, 
"it's going to be around for quite a while. As a matter of fact, we're getting 
a lot of teachers coming in to learn it so they can teach their own private 
students. And that's always a sign that there's a lot of serious interest in a 
dance." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the potential embarrassment of taking a class that calls for 
immediate and intimate contact with strangers, Chavez laughed heartily. "Oh, 
I've got an easy answer for that. Some people hold back a bit. But I tell them, 
'Ladies, I promise you, you will not get pregnant.' They all laugh, and once a 
few of them get started they all get into it. 
</P>
<P>
"And when I get someone who's really nervous about dancing so close with a 
stranger, I say, 'Hey, it's a good way to get acquainted -- fast!' " 
</P>
<P>
On the East Coast, Kathy Blake, a New Hampshire-based teacher/performer who has 
released more than 50 instructional dance videos, including one on the Lambada, 
is equally enthusiastic. "I'm excited about it," she said. "We teachers love to 
see a dance craze come along that's fun and different. I think it's going to 
become very popular in the spring and into the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Blake used an amateur video of Lambada dancers, made by a producer who went to 
several German nightclubs to capture the moves, as the foundation for her 
interpretation of the dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is finding their own way to structure it," said Blake. "There really 
isn't any other way to do it, because there is no published dance syllabus from 
the Imperial Society of England, which is what we usually teach from." 
</P>
<P>
"Lambada is dance that came right out of the streets," she continued. "And I 
think that's why all of us teachers were so taken by surprise. But that's OK, 
because that's where all dance originates, anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
Chavez, a tall, elegant tango champion and expert in Latin dances, says he 
picked up the fundamentals of the Lambada "from a Brazilian from Bahia. But the 
original only has a very few variations, and you can't satisfy the American or 
the European public with a few variations. So we added little turns, little 
different pieces of character to the way we teach it. We wanted to keep the 
original Brazilian quality and add something to it." 
</P>
<P>
A recent Thursday night session at his Warner Dance Center West revealed how 
successful Chavez has been with his personalized version of the Lambada. The 
class included a wide mixture of students, ranging from young people in their 
teens and 20s to a vivacious 83-year-old named Belle Yuster. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a short skirt, black stockings and high heels, Yuster moved through 
the quick steps and swinging hip movements of the dance with the easy flare of 
a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a marvelous dance," she said, "and I love the freedom of it." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the sexy qualities of the Lambada -- the intertwined thighs and 
body-to-body movements? 
</P>
<P>
"Bah," scoffed Yuster. "I'm dancing with a man I go steady with. Doing the 
dance is no sexier than what happens when I sit on his lap. No difference. And 
with morals the way they are these days, who's going to ask questions? So if 
you enjoy it, you just dance. And I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Homemaker Toby Anne Schwartz, moving sensuously around the floor with a 
succession of partners, paused for a few moments to agree with Yuster. "I just 
don't think there's any way you can sit still once you hear those Lambada 
rhythms. And as far as the sexiness is concerned, once you get out on the 
floor, you quickly lose whatever shyness you might have about some of the dance 
movements." 
</P>
<P>
Businessman Arnold Kramer, enthusiastically taking his third Lambada class, 
added a third voice of agreement. "I love the sexy aspects of it," he said. 
"It's got much more style to it than 'Dirty Dancing' does, and it really brings 
out the sensuality in women. And that's great." 
</P>
<P>
The Lambada's overnight popularity in the United States has followed an 
enormous rage for the dance last summer in Europe. Epic Records' "Lambada," the 
first single release from Kaoma, the group that started the whole thing, sold 
more than 4 million copies in Europe alone -- an astounding figure. 
</P>
<P>
By August, Paris was filled with Lambada dance clubs and an almost assuredly 
apocryphal press release from Epic Records described a huge crowd of East 
Germans "doing the Lambada to welcome Mikhail Gorbachev on the occasion of his 
October visit." 
</P>
<P>
The dance itself traces to the northern provinces of Brazil. Its Caribbean 
influenced rhythms and African-like movements made it extremely popular in 
rural areas. In the 1930s, a Lambada-like dance was banned by Getulio Vargas, 
the country's then-dictator, for its lascivious qualities. 
</P>
<P>
It surfaced again in more contemporary form in the '60s and '70s. But its 
popularity never approached that of Brazil's omnipresent samba, and it wasn't 
until two French entrepreneurs took the dance back to Europe last summer that 
its international popularity began to rise like a comet. 
</P>
<P>
"What I find fascinating, as an instructor," said Kathy Blake, "and I've been 
doing Latin dances for 20 some years, is that the Lambada feels like a really 
new dance, with unique movements. They are not just rehashes. The swinging of 
the hips in relationship to the footwork is not exactly a merengue, not exactly 
a samba, not exactly like anything I've done before. And that's kind of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a new dance. It may have a little bit of this and a little bit of 
that, but in total it's not like anything I've done in all my years of 
dancing." 
</P>
<P>
While the sensuous movements of the Lambada have been its most highly 
publicized elements, perhaps its real significance is that it represents a 
return to couples dancing -- with a vengeance. Not since the hustle -- which in 
itself was not a particularly good example -- have dancers had the opportunity 
to dance with arms (and, in the case of the Lambada, legs) intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
"I see people feeling both ways about the dance," said dance instructor Craig 
Morris. "Some don't want to do it because it looks like sex on the dance floor; 
some want to do it for exactly the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
"But once they start learning the Lambada as a dance, they find out there's 
more to it. Best of all, it's dancing with a partner, which I think is really 
what dancing's all about." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of dances come in," continued Morris, "and as a dance instructor you 
have to learn them. Then, just about the point where you have them learned, 
they're out. But I don't think that's going to be true with the Lambada. It's 
fresh, it has a new, vigorous kind of feeling, and I think it's going to be 
around for quite a while."

WARRANT MEMBERS TO JAM AT CANOGA PARK AIDS BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Wednesday, Mancini's Restaurant in Canoga Park will be served with a 
warrant. Two Warrants, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
At least two members of the popular rock band Warrant are scheduled to play at 
a jam session on Valentine's Day. Money raised from the event will go to 
organizations representing patients with AIDS and other blood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to participate are the band's bassist, Jerry Dixon, and guitarist 
Erick Turner, fresh from their nationwide tour as the opening act for Motley 
Crue. Warrant, which will appear at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on Feb. 
20, has recorded chart hits such as "Heaven," and "Down Boys." Other Warrant 
members also may play at the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of Dixon and Turner has been confirmed by restaurant owner 
Dennis Mancini and Jay Nevens, vice president of George Mahoney &amp; 
Associates, the consulting firm coordinating the event. A band spokeswoman 
would neither confirm nor deny it. 
</P>
<P>
Nancee Lee, an AIDS therapist whose connections with Warrant helped set up the 
appearance, said the show will cost $15. Tickets for the show and dinner will 
be $40. Lee said organizers hope to attract 300 people and raise at least 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is life and death for the kids," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Lee said, the money will go toward the opening of the Bobbie 
Andelson Youth Home in the Wilshire District. The home will care for teen-agers 
with the AIDS virus, offering school, sports, art, music, and psychological 
support services. Because of their virus, the youngsters, many of whom are 
runaways, have been unable to find shelter. The building is ready to be 
occupied, Lee said, and it needs about $60,000 for operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Mancini said each night after 9 p.m., his restaurant becomes "Club M," a 
dance/rock 'n' roll venue featuring live bands. 
</P>
<P>
"That show," Mancini said, "is going to put my name out there. It's going to 
get my club known." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Warrant will play in a jam session with Doc Lawrence and the 
Tracer's, the headline group. Dinner will go from 7 to 9 p.m., with music from 
9 p.m. to 1 a.m. The jam session costs $15, with dinner, $40. For information, 
call (213) 445-5076.

PREVIEW: CLARINETIST'S PUBLIC VALENTINE TO 12 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valentine's Day is set aside for the woman in one's life -- or in the case of 
clarinetist William Powell, 12 of the women. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, chairman of the instrumental performance program at CalArts in 
Valencia, will give a concert Wednesday in which his Valentine's dozen figure 
prominently. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the women composed the pieces he and his musicians will perform. The 
other six are women who have influenced his life, and Powell is dedicating the 
performances to them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my mom and her five sisters, who helped put me through music school and 
did a lot of wonderful things for me," said Powell, an accomplished performer 
who has championed the clarinet for use in both traditional and contemporary 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked the pieces according to how I perceive them," he said. "The one for 
my mother is a premiere. It's the most romantic work in its instrumentation." 
</P>
<P>
Called "Quintet," the piece was written last year by Joelle Wallach, winner of 
several international competitions for composers. The work is for clarinet and 
string quartet. Wallach flew in from New York to help with rehearsals. She, and 
the other five composers, probably will be on hand for Wednesday's concert, 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell is known for his eclectic repertoire, so it no surprise that the 
Valentine's Day selections represent a wide range of music. "Shakti III," by 
Beverly Grigsby, uses a clarinet, tabla and a Fairlight III, a computer that 
plays music. "Shakti" in the Hindu religion is divine light. The piece is 
dedicated to an aunt of Powell's who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
Composer Grigsby is a professor at Cal State Northridge, where she founded the 
Computer Music Studio in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners unfamiliar with the experiments of modern composition will find 
something new in "Through the Lullaby," a piece by Sally Lamb for clarinet and 
piano. Powell said it "explores meter through gestural displacement and a 
humorous relationship between consonance and dissonance." 
</P>
<P>
Portions of "Ningana" have a decided show-biz air, he said. The work, by Jane 
Brockman, is for clarinet, electronics and tape. The name comes from a Maori 
word for "resting place." 
</P>
<P>
Other works on the program are "Nocturne" for solo clarinet, by Deborah 
Kavasch, and "Harlequin" for clarinet, viola, harp and percussion, by Kathleen 
St. John. 
</P>
<P>
Powell is a specialist in music by modern women composers. He performed at the 
International Congresses of Women in Music at USC in 1982, in Paris in 1984 and 
in Bremen, West Germany, in 1988. He said there are many talented women 
composers and he wants to be certain their music is heard. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally women have more difficulty getting performances of their work," he 
said. "For that reason, they sometimes give up composing." 
</P>
<P>
Although his Valentine's Day sentiments are decidedly romantic, Powell has an 
ulterior motive in his selection of material. He will perform some of the works 
in New York in March, which is Women's History Month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Valentine's Day Recital" featuring William Powell; 8 p.m Wednesday, Roy O. 
Disney Hall; CalArts, 24700 McBean Parkway, Valencia; $5 general, $2 students 
and senior citizens; for information telephone (818) 367-5507 or (805)

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: TWO S.D. EXHIBITS OF TRIBAL ART PROVE A 
PLEASANT CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEAH OLLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is pleasure, indeed, that greets the visitor of two current shows of art 
from tribal cultures, but it is an aesthetic pleasure not without its 
intellectual challenges. Our appreciation of such work has far outpaced our 
understanding of it, and all too often ritual and practical objects from other 
cultures stand in stark white exhibition spaces as if holding their breath, 
suspended in a falsely still, foreign world. 
</P>
<P>
A timeless beauty permeates both shows, "Blades of Beauty and Death: African 
Art Forged in Metal," at the Mesa College Art Gallery and "Ancestral Voices: 
Indonesian Tribal Art," at the Oneiros Gallery. The visual splendor of the work 
-- especially in the African show -- helps cut across the cultural and 
chronological barriers between our world and that of the tribal cultures 
represented, but contradictions and questions intrude upon the experience. 
</P>
<P>
As anthropologist and art historian Sally Price explains in her provocative new 
book, "Primitive Art in Civilized Places," work from tribal cultures is 
generally perceived as the product of a communal sensibility, wholly determined 
by tradition. Even in these two shows, however, the work's extraordinary 
variety of forms and techniques testifies to its makers' expressive intent. 
Why, if we regard this work as art, do we ignore the issue of individual 
authorship, an issue integral to our notion of artistic genius? And why do we 
gloss over the works' specific time and place of origin, as if these were 
peripheral to our experience of it? 
</P>
<P>
These questions haunt all such exhibitions of tribal art, however respectfully 
they are organized and installed. Their resolution depends not only on further 
scholarship, but on acknowledgment of the double standards and prejudices that 
temper our perception of tribal cultures. The western world's patronizing 
superiority trickles down into even the most well-intentioned of cultural 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Both shows speak of an engagement with life vastly different from our own, a 
sense of continuity between life and death, and acute attention to the rhythms 
and vagaries of the earth. In visual terms, the work speaks loudly and clearly, 
but as the tools and tales of a people, it needs translation. Didactic panels, 
descriptive labels, contextual photographs, even an educational video as Mesa 
included in a previous African show, all help mediate the vast distance between 
our worlds and give such displays a sense of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Blades of Beauty and Death" succeeds fairly well in this respect. A 
straightforward essay and detailed catalogue entries by Mesa professor Barbara 
Blackmun, who curated the show with Jacques Hautelet, set the stage for the 70 
objects on view, all of which belong to a private collector. Blades here are 
living things -- gestural, lyrical, delicate and refined. Whether coarsely 
hammered or finely polished and incised, they were all meant to confer 
authority and status upon their owner. 
</P>
<P>
The currency blades, the most austere of the four types of blades on view, have 
an impressive integrity of form, whether of imposing height or more modest 
scale. Non-functional, they were used in exchanges of value. 
</P>
<P>
The straight blades and curved swords, used for functional and ceremonial 
purposes, are exquisitely designed and crafted. Braided lines, patterned 
borders and meandering calligraphic markings appear on the surface of the iron 
blades and echo their varied shapes. Absolute geometry is less apparent than a 
system of lines and shapes that concedes to the organic world, often suggesting 
human and animal forms. Several straight blades and curved swords assume an 
anthropomorphic form, with a long blade for a body, and arms uplifted in a 
circle around a small knob of a head. The throwing knives, made to be flung so 
their blades rotate in a deadly whir, seem to fly even when standing still. 
They embody an untrammeled energy and a fluid grace. 
</P>
<P>
The continuity of tradition in tribal cultures is said to make the dating of 
objects very difficult. Work in both the Mesa and Oneiros shows has been dated, 
roughly, to the 19th and 20th Centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In "Ancestral Voices," work from the private collection of local dealer Mark A. 
Johnson spans a broad spectrum of Indonesian ritual and utilitarian objects, 
but includes no puppets used in traditional shadow plays. A carved ancestor 
figure, nearly life-sized, stands near the entrance to the gallery, as it would 
before a home, staring intensely but calmly from wide almond eyes and 
outstretching its arms in a gesture of welcoming and protection. Another, 
carved on a wooden tomb door, has a stark, spiritual power, its chest a simple 
slab, its arms doubling back and ending in square, unarticulated hands. 
</P>
<P>
More aggressive is a Hudoq mask from Borneo, which shoots a demonic stare from 
large red and black eyes. Points jut forward everywhere, from the nose, teeth 
and ears, giving this evil spirit used in funeral rites, or perhaps also in 
rice-sowing ceremonies, a threatening intensity. Tiny fetishes, remarkably 
vital for such small, static figures, and a selection of woven textiles and 
decorated containers are also included in the show. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Indonesian objects and the African blades derive from cultures in 
which the present and past, function and beauty, are seamlessly integrated. In 
exemplifying this union, the works feel vaguely soul-satisfying, for they 
introduce us to values that complement our own, values so absent from our 
coolly efficient society, in which a clean line is drawn between the order of 
life and the passion of art. Our artistic ancestors -- adherents of the British 
and American Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th Century, and members of 
the Bauhaus school in Germany in the '20s -- tried hard to erase that line, or 
at least to smudge it enough to allow for some overlap between objects of daily 
use and objects of beauty, but in the end, the products of their efforts 
ascended, ironically, to the status of luxury objects. 
</P>
<P>
Curators and viewers alike must be on guard to prevent this distorting 
phenomenon from inflicting itself on objects from tribal cultures, divesting 
them of their human history and rendering them precious, remote objects of 
beauty. While their remarkable forms deserve admiration, so too do the tales, 
spirits and lives they represent beg for release. 
</P>
<P>
"Blades of Beauty" continues at the Mesa College Art Gallery (7250 Mesa College 
Drive, D-104) through March 7. "Ancestral Voices," at the Oneiros Gallery (711 
Eighth Ave., Studio A), ends March 3.

REPORT SAID COUNTY, MOST CITIES HAD NO SPILL PLAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For residents of beach cities in Orange County, a massive oil spill was the 
realization of their worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, concern has mounted in these shoreline communities 
about the risk of an oil spill that would destroy marine life, force the 
closure of beaches and result in millions of lost tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been an ongoing concern," Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. 
Frank said in an interview Thursday. "That's why we've been so vigorous in 
opposing offshore oil drilling. This just goes to show you that no matter how 
much you try, it (a spill) happens." 
</P>
<P>
They had support for their fears. A 1989 study commissioned by a coalition of 
the county's coastal cities warned that the risk of a spill was high, based on 
a prediction by the Department of the Interior that there was a better than 99% 
chance that Orange County offshore oil development would result in a spill of 
greater than 1,000 gallons within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the report stated, "of the coastal cities in the county, only 
Huntington Beach has an oil spill contingency plan." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, 300,000 gallons of oil gushed from a damaged tanker mooring 
off Huntington Beach. A little more than 24 hours later, oil was washing onto 
the sand in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials foresaw the threat as early as 1979, when the city 
conducted a study that urged the development of a countywide contingency plan 
for a major disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Such plans will correct serious deficiencies that now exist in most 
communities," the 1979 report said. "Because virtually all containment and 
cleanup equipment is located in the Long Beach/Los Angeles Harbor, Orange 
County beaches are even more vulnerable to a large spill than those of Los 
Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a spill, primary responsibility for cleanup falls on the oil 
company and the Coast Guard. However, "a massive oil spill would exceed the 
current capacity of both the (oil) industry's cooperative and the Coast Guard 
to contain it," the 1979 report said. "In this event, local governments will be 
required to become involved in cleanup operations." 
</P>
<P>
The study also recommended that each city set up specific storage locations for 
onshore containment equipment, establish "control centers" to act as 
clearinghouses of information for local response personnel, and determine the 
location of the most environmentally sensitive areas within their community. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, no countywide or local plans exist for the de-foulment of birds," 
the 1979 report said. "It is therefore recommended that an animal cleaning 
center be established and stocked." 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old study also called for the state to establish a fund for cities 
that have environmentally sensitive areas. The money could be used for 
training, to purchase booms and other containment equipment and to cover 
planning costs. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, the county still was not properly prepared, the 1989 study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The later study was commissioned jointly by the cities of Huntington Beach, 
Laguna Beach, San Clemente, Newport Beach and the county to determine the risk 
of a spill if a new set of leases was awarded to oil companies for offshore 
drilling. At the time, the Department of the Interior was considering awarding 
about 1,300 leases off the coast between the Monterey-San Luis Obispo county 
line on the north and the Mexican border on the south. 
</P>
<P>
A Virginia-based consultant, Townsend Environmental, conducted the $200,000 
study on behalf of the beach cities and concluded that Orange County was in 
dire need of a preparedness plan, and that only Huntington Beach had an oil 
spill contingency plan. 
</P>
<P>
The study called for the county to identify environmentally sensitive areas, 
purchase equipment capable of tracking the path of a massive oil slick, station 
containment equipment so that response time is two hours or less, and conduct 
underwater surveys to establish tide patterns. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday night, when a hole was punctured in the hull of a tanker off 
Orange County's coast, none of those measures apparently had been enacted.

CLEANUP COST MAY RUN CLOSE TO $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cost of cleaning up Wednesday's nearly 300,000-gallon oil spill off 
Huntington Beach is expected to reach tens of millions of dollars, with the 
bulk to be paid by the owner of the damaged tanker and its insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup officials said it was much too early to determine what it will all 
cost. But Coast Guard experts said that, based on their experience with other 
spills, the cost would certainly be less than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based American Trading Transportation Co. will bear the burden of 
paying cleanup costs and defending lawsuits because it is the sole owner of the 
disabled tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"The ship's owner has accepted legal and financial responsibility for the 
spill," said Vivian Davis, a spokesman for British Petroleum, which hired 
American Trading to transport its oil from Alaska to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading issued a statement saying it had a $400-million insurance 
policy with a Norwegian firm to cover claims stemming from the accident. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum's liability is limited because its only connection to the 
spill was in chartering the American Trader to transport 23 million gallons of 
oil to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their different liabilities, both BP and American Trading sent crews to 
aid in the cleanup Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The financial liabilities surrounding the Huntington Beach spill differ greatly 
from those that accompanied the nation's largest oil spill last March at Prince 
William Sound in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Corp. owned the tanker that dumped 10.92 million gallons of oil into the 
sound, which devastated a chunk of Alaska's coastline and much of the marine 
life there. 
</P>
<P>
Because it owned the vessel, Exxon has had to assume many of the costs 
associated with cleaning up Alaska's shoreline. So far, the company has placed 
the bill -- for itself and others -- at $2 billion, not including any liability 
from the more than 150 lawsuits Exxon is facing. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of cleaning up the oil off Huntington Beach were hard to come by 
Wednesday because the operation is still in the early stages and any drastic 
change in weather conditions could cause the situation to worsen. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many variables," said David Stith, president of Underwater Technics, 
a Philadelphia-based marine salvage and pollution company. "I have handled 
spills that we have anticipated would only cost several million dollars and we 
exceeded that by a factor of 10." 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said, however, that it expects the final tally to be somewhere 
in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any history to support more than $100 million" on such a spill, 
said Ron Dixon, a senior program analyst for the Coast Guard in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading President Sanford V. Schmidt said he would be shocked if the 
bill was higher than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"God forbid," he said. "We haven't had a drop of oil come to the shore yet. If 
that costs hundreds of millions of dollars, I'm in the wrong business."

OIL SKIMMERS PLOW A SEA OF CONTAMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD and MARIA NEWMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like tractors tilling a vast field, a pair of skimmer boats plowing through the 
subdued waters off Huntington Beach on Thursday represented what officials 
believed was the best hope of conquering the American Trader oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
But the boats were painfully slow, moving at only about 2 m.p.h. with their oil 
suction booms deployed. And their oil collection capacity was limited to about 
1,200 barrels. They appeared as specks amid the miles-long spill from the 
breached oil tanker. 
</P>
<P>
The two large skimmer vessels, converted from crew boats that serve offshore 
oil drilling platforms, were being supplemented by two smaller skimmers. In 
addition, the Coast Guard reported that three other private oil skimming 
vessels and 15 Navy skimmers were en route. 
</P>
<P>
The boats formed the main vanguard in the war to fight the oil spill. The 
troops -- about 400 shovel-armed beach cleaners -- were awaiting their call. 
</P>
<P>
"Right here in this area we have some of the biggest assets . . . and cleanup 
effort equipment in the world," said Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard's 
commandant. "I've never seen an oil spill where you have this kind of response 
in less than 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Nature also was aiding in the effort. Mild weather and seas aided the sea 
skimmers, and the Coast Guard estimated that 30% of the oil would simply 
evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
To a large extent, the Coast Guard sat back and watched the action. Coast Guard 
officials said that while they were deeply involved in monitoring and strategy, 
they would only take charge if the oil company efforts prove inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Just what is considered adequate appeared to depend largely on the available 
resources. Some observers, such as city officials in Long Beach, said they 
believe there isn't enough cleanup equipment available to handle a major spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided if we had to handle a disaster the size of the (Exxon) Valdez, it 
couldn't be done with the amount of equipment on hand," said Long Beach 
Assistant City Manager John Shirey, who took part in city hearings on the issue 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The initial response to Wednesday's spill came within moments but fell woefully 
short, some officials said. A boat that routinely accompanies tankers to their 
moorings off Huntington Beach tried to boom off the ship, but Coast Guard 
officials said it did not have enough floating plastic skirt to encircle the 
American Trader and a trail of oil escaped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In about an hour after notification, the first cleanup boats of Clean Coastal 
Waters, a Long Beach-based oil spill service funded by major oil companies, 
arrived and started booming and skimming. 
</P>
<P>
At daybreak Thursday, a pair of oil-skimming vessels were trawling about five 
miles offshore. They had booms draped over either side that could hold the 
suction equipment. At their peak efficiency, they can each cut a 125-foot swath 
through the oil-covered sea, said Patrick Martin, a Clean Coastal Waters 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
While their oil storage capacity is limited, they can dump their loads into 
barges so they can stay on station. Besides Clean Coastal Waters, the Clean 
Seas cooperative in Santa Barbara was dispatching skimmer ships. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a smaller, twin-hulled skimmer boat and a team of beach cleaners 
from the private Chempro Environmental Services was hired. General Manager Guy 
Bubica said 60 or 70 workers were waiting for oil to wash up on the beaches. 
Another 300 or more could be pressed into service if needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bubica added that the company had so much boom awaiting use that it was still 
stacked in the company's storage yard.

2ND INSPECTION OF CLIFF EXTENDS ROAD CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The discovery Thursday of crevices "large enough to fit a man inside" in cliffs 
overlooking El Camino Real means that a stretch of the road will now be closed 
for weeks rather than days. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission on Thursday granted an emergency permit to repair 
the cliffs, where serious erosion was recently discovered between Avenida Pico 
and Camino Capistrano. City officials, who originally predicted that work could 
be finished and the highway reopened by the weekend, found the instability more 
serious than was first supposed, City Manager Michael W. Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to look at the bluff, it was alarming," Parness said. "Below, the 
rocks look flush, but on top you can see daylight between tons of rock and 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
City workers noticed the trouble on Sunday. Crews sent to remove rubble on the 
highway after weekend rains saw that the bluffs above looked unstable. 
</P>
<P>
An engineer hired by the city visited the site the next day and presented 
Parness with evidence that the cliffs were unsound. The city manager closed the 
mile-long stretch of highway at 7 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Closer inspection of the bluffs also found that they are riddled with rodent 
holes, City Engineer William Cameron are. 
</P>
<P>
The city plans to make the cliffs safe by breaking up the unstable chunks of 
rock and earth, some as large as 75 feet across, into smaller pieces, Cameron 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the bluffs were so unstable that engineers were reluctant to bring in 
heavy machinery, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration of the bluffs came quickly, with the rains coming after all 
the dry weather we've been having," Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is negotiating with several contractors to find one with the best 
equipment to do the job, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
The bluffs are part of a 250-acre section of undeveloped land owned by the Lusk 
Co. of Irvine, which is working with the city to stabilize the area. 
</P>
<P>
Cameron said he would "expect the city's finances to be impacted minimally." 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente police are stationed on both sides of the roadblock and are 
admitting only residents of a mobile home park located on the closed highway. 
</P>
<P>
The closure has snarled traffic at the Avenida Palizada and Avenida Pico exits 
of Interstate 5, as drivers seek alternate routes. In addition, drivers exiting 
Avenida Pico confront construction work being done on ramps, and a wait of up 
to 10 minutes at nearby traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of days, people have been coming in here steaming," said John 
Webright, manager of Aaron Brothers art supply store at 416 Avenida Pico. "It's 
pretty much congested all day." 
</P>
<P>
The closure was the latest in a series that have plagued the coastal community 
in recent years. The latest occurred in April, when 2,000 cubic yards of mud 
and rock tumbled onto the highway after a rain. Three cliff-top homes lost part 
of the their yards in the landslide.

DIANNE KLEIN: AN OIL-SOAKED BIRD IS A SORROWFUL SIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up the road, tourists, high school kids and the locals crowd around outraged 
environmentalists demanding accountability and change. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists rail against offshore oil drilling and greed. They point 
to the oil-slick sea beyond the Huntington Beach pier. Television cameras bear 
down. Microphones and sound booms reverberate with angry noise. 
</P>
<P>
Here inside a cluttered lifeguard storage garage about a mile away, it is 
quieter, but the smell of oil is so heavy you can taste it. 
</P>
<P>
Millicent Wood of the International Bird Rescue Research Center pulls a western 
grebe, its feathers dull with crude, from a cardboard box. 
</P>
<P>
The red of its eyes, terrified, cut like unblinking lasers. Its cry is sharp 
and loud, bone chilling in its pain. The bird urinates and tries to fight back, 
but Wood's hand has clamped firmly around its long, thin beak. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 gallons of oil spilled into the ocean off Huntington Beach from 
the hull of the American Trader, carrying British Petroleum crude oil. It was 
an accident. 
</P>
<P>
Here in the storage garage, though, one can see what carelessness really means. 
So far, 25 oil-drenched birds, alive and suffering, have arrived. Eight others 
were dead from the spill. 
</P>
<P>
These numbers, of course, will surely change. The estimates are that they will 
get worse. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, I am sure, people will begin to put this in perspective. They will say 
that the animal death toll at Huntington Beach is, comparatively, not bad. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 sea otters were killed in Valdez waters, more than 2,800 birds. The 
oil that blanketed Alaska's Prince William Sound congealed with the cold. In 
Surf City, evaporation from a warm sun may lessen the harm. 
</P>
<P>
But when I see these birds, all of this becomes an abstraction, only marginally 
meaningful to the sorrow at hand. The oil has clogged the aquatic lifeline. 
Here is only the most visible proof. 
</P>
<P>
When a bird is coated in oil, its feathers lose their ability to protect the 
creature from the cold. Its waterproofing protection is ruined. 
</P>
<P>
Birds such as the grebe, which dive for their food, find themselves unable to 
fly away. Those that are able to swim try desperately to hold their heads above 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Huntington Beach, human arrogance and bumbling has, once again, brought 
environmental tragedy close at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Fischer, an officer of the state Department of Fish and Game, reaches 
inside a cardboard box for another blackened grebe that a volunteer has found 
on the shore. The bird screams and tries to bite, which is a good sign. There 
is life worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
The bird is weighed and its temperature taken rectally, as one would do with a 
small child. Its leg is tagged and then Millicent Wood fills a syringe with 
Pedialyte, an electrolyte-rich solution for sick children, and places the thin 
rubber tubing down the bird's throat. It drinks. 
</P>
<P>
In a minute, the bird will join the others in a long plywood box, like a crude 
coffin, which is cushioned with crushed newspaper and draped with a white 
sheet. Here the birds rest and regain some of their body heat. 
</P>
<P>
The oil fumes will lessen with time. Perhaps some of the sea creatures will 
eat. People are to be kept away. In about 24 hours, after the birds have calmed 
down, they will be washed with a solution of water and Dawn detergent, the one 
that experience proves works best. 
</P>
<P>
This, now, is the procedure, grimly calm and assured. Wednesday night, before 
British Petroleum agreed to pay the Berkeley-based bird rescue center to take 
charge, volunteers scrubbed off the first six birds right away. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers have been quick to offer their help in Huntington Beach. Mothers and 
fathers have come with their children. People have taken off work. 
</P>
<P>
As I watch, one woman brings in a pigeon which she thinks has been damaged by 
the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Fischer looks at it, holding it in his hand, and determines that it is 
merely ill. Then he picks up a dead grebe, limp and slick, and shows the woman 
what she should look for. She nods, and leaves to find something else. 
</P>
<P>
Then one of the volunteers says that she has gotten a call from Shell Oil, 
offering a place to house more sick birds. Everyone laughs at that one, and 
soon they start imagining the public relations benefits the company would reap. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just see it," says one Fish and Game officer. " 'We care' the ads will 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Just before I leave the garage, I ask Jon Fischer how he keeps his anger in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'm angry," he says. "Aren't you? It's really upsetting to see this 
happen. . . . But maybe people will get upset enough to put some safety 
measures in place to protect our resources. If that happens, then it is 
possible that this, at least in some regard, could be a good thing."

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corinne Prado insisted that if she was going out to help savebirds from the 
Huntington Beach oil spill, her two children had to come along too, even if 
that meant they had to miss school Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"They can explain this to their classmates," she said. "I love birds, and I try 
to save the wildlife. They can learn from this." 
</P>
<P>
So Prado, 36, along with her children -- Kristine, 7, and Joshua, 10 -- drove 
from Los Angeles to the shore at the Huntington Beach Pier, where she joined 
about 100 volunteers who grabbed cardboard boxes, cloths and rags and searched 
for oil-drenched birds. The group included retirees, longtime residents, 
students, office workers, surfers and a salesman from Cal Worthington Ford. 
</P>
<P>
By late afternoon, more than two dozen oil-soaked birds had been found, at 
least eight of them dead. City and state officials worked at a state lifeguard 
headquarters to save the birds by cleaning them with liquid soap. 
</P>
<P>
Many more oil-soaked birds are expected to be found in the next few days, said 
Victor Leipzig, the executive director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy and a 
biology professor at Cypress College, who was coordinating the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the oil doesn't come to shore doesn't mean that we won't have 
oil out there," said Leipzig, who is also a Huntington Beach planning 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"There are big numbers (of birds) out there," he said. "February is a bad time 
for an oil spill. This is one time they're out there in much larger numbers." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the birds brought in have been gulls, cormorants, grebes and scoters, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers who found injured birds wrapped them in cloth to keep their body 
temperatures from dropping, Leipzig said. The birds were then taken to a state 
lifeguard station at Magnolia Street and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
There, area biologists and Department of Fish and Game experts tried to clean 
them with warm water and liquid soap, which takes several hours, Leipzig said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are saturated to a point where they lose body temperature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In radio reports, Huntington Beach officials asked that volunteers bring boxes, 
soap, towels and rags. By early afternoon, a bird rescue station, set up at a 
city lifeguard post just south of the pier, was surrounded by about two dozen 
boxes of rags, old T-shirts and towels. One Amway salesman donated several 
bottles of soap, and one person brought doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
By noon, city officials had received almost 2,000 calls from people offering 
help in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Mieras, 30, of Corona del Mar was among those who found an oil-soaked 
bird that showed signs of life. She had come to the beach after taking a day 
off from her job. 
</P>
<P>
"I care about the environment, and I care about the birds," said Mieras, a food 
broker. "This is more important than working, as far as I'm concerned. They can 
lose me for a day or so." 
</P>
<P>
Many volunteers said they came because they were upset that the spill was 
allowed to happen and because they felt the need to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't think of it as happenning in your own back yard," said Amy Roedl, 
37, of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Roedl decided to come out, even if that meant bringing along her 13-month-old 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I love birds, I really love birds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Jane Mayfield, 27, of Bellflower arrived at about 6 a.m. after a sleepless 
night, worried that something had to be done to save the birds and other 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Tilley, 61, of Cypress, a salesman who arrived at about 6:30 a.m., was 
disturbed by the gawkers who had come to the beach to catch a glimpse of the 
tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here is supposed to be so interested in ecology," he said, "and I'm 
watching people drop their damn plastic cups." 
</P>
<P>
Some longtime Huntington Beach residents said they considered it their civic 
duty to help in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our beach. We live here," said Judy Bailey, 40, a 19-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
David Thompson, 20, a student at Orange Coast College, pointed out that 
everyone depends on oil, so the blame of the spill must be shared. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody enjoys this beach," Thompson said. "Everybody has got to be 
responsible. Everybody is to blame."

<P>
CITY SEEKS TO LIMIT PEEP SHOW HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Another round in the battle between the city of Garden Grove and the operators 
of peep shows is scheduled for today as the city attempts to crack down on 
alleged lewd activity and other problems at A-Z Books. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the city will appear before Superior Court Judge John C. Wooley 
seeking to impose shorter operating hours on the adult bookstore and peep show 
business at 8192 Garden Grove Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The store is open 24 hours a day. According to City Atty. Stuart C. Scudder, 
the city will be seeking to limit the operating hours to between 8 a.m. and 8 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the apartment building behind the store have complained of 
customers littering, making noise and committing lewd acts, Scudder said. 
</P>
<P>
A police report prepared for the City Council said that undercover police 
officers were solicited for lewd acts 15 times between October, 1988, and July, 
1989. Also, a police officer has observed customers exposing themselves in 
arcade booths in the peep show portion of the business. 
</P>
<P>
"Were those acts all on the A-Z property, or just near it?" asked Roger 
Diamond, attorney for the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a world of difference there. I don't have any evidence that lewd acts 
are being committed on the property. If it's not on the property, that's 
somebody else's problem. And as for the noise, there's a bar just a short 
distance away that can account for some of the noise." 
</P>
<P>
The city is also trying to get A-Z to remove the curtains from the booths of 
its video arcade. While most of Garden Grove's seven adult bookstore and peep 
show operators have agreed to conform with the city's ban on doors in the video 
booths, A-Z Books replaced its doors with lacy curtains. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the City Council voted 5-0 to tighten up the 1983 ordinance 
governing doors and curtains so that the law reads "no partially or fully 
enclosed booths shall be maintained." Diamond said that the ordinance doesn't 
prohibit curtains. Moreover, he said, the store's curtains don't block the view 
of exit signs that the city ordinance requires customers to be able to see.

ANOTHER STEP TAKEN FOR CITY ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of a stretch of new condominiums, restaurants, theaters and shops 
that will make up the city's Main Pier redevelopment center, the city is 
setting aside a corner for art. 
</P>
<P>
With the City Council's approval this week of conceptual design plans, 
officials are on the way toward opening the Huntington Beach Art Center in the 
spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be in a renovated, 39-year-old international-industrial-style 
building on Main Street at Acacia Avenue. In June, 1988, the city paid $758,000 
for the building, which had been used as office space for Southern California 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong renovation is expected to cost an additional $750,000. The 
improvements will be funded by the newly formed Huntington Beach Arts Center 
Foundation, a nonprofit group, according to Naida Osline, the center's 
director. The foundation is raising money largely through grants and corporate 
and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the 11,000-square-foot center to include three galleries, a 
studio for workshops and classes, a multipurpose room that will feature 
performances, lectures, films and videos, and an art-related bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Osline said the center will exhibit paintings, sculptures and various 
mixed-media art forms. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give people a cultural context so it means something to people, not 
just something decorating the walls," she said. "We are going to try to involve 
people in ideas and issues." 
</P>
<P>
The city's only other art facilities are small galleries at Golden West College 
and the Huntington Beach Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
The new art center is the culmination of more than a decade of effort by the 
city's Allied Arts Board, a council advisory committee that identified the Main 
Street building in 1983. The idea took shape in 1986 when the city created a 
cultural affairs division of the Community Services Department, Osline said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will get their first chance to tour the future art center building, 
examine renovation plans and meet the center's coordinating staff at an open 
house scheduled for 5 to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. JOHN PENNER

$3.5-MILLION MALL RENOVATION PLANNED

<TEXT>
<P>
The city will sell $3.5 million worth of bonds to redevelop property at the 
west end of Fashion Square Mall. 
</P>
<P>
About $2.6 million will be used to acquire property, demolish buildings and 
construct a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder will go for interest, a reserve fund, selling costs and other 
expenses, City Manager Lee Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
The new stores that will be constructed as part of the redevelopment project 
are expected to generate about $53 million in annual sales tax revenue by the 
second year of operation, Risner said. The existing Bullock's store is expected 
to remain. 
</P>
<P>
The demolition is scheduled to start in March, and the construction project, 
which includes four major stores, is expected to begin in April. The mall, 
which is at Beach Boulevard and Imperial Highway, is scheduled to open Nov. 15.

CITY TO INSTALL TWO RADAR SPEED SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Signs that automatically display the speeds of passing drivers and the speed 
limit will be installed at two sites in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The movable radar signs, which are expected to be up for about six weeks, will 
be used in connection with police surveillance to decrease drivers' speeds. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council this week agreed to spend $14,000 for the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Irwin M. Fried said when he once passed such a sign, "the first 
thing I did was check my speed. The second thing I did was check the speed 
limit on the street. The third thing I did was check to see if there were any 
police cars around, and the fourth thing I did was I definitely slowed down." 
</P>
<P>
The council has not yet decided where the trailers will be placed.

CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM GIVEN OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE ESPY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has approved a curbside recycling program that will start this summer. 
Monthly garbage collection rates will increase from $7.53 to $9.99 to finance 
the $2.6-million program. 
</P>
<P>
The new rates will take effect July 1, with the recycling program scheduled to 
begin shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia residents will receive two 110-gallon trash containers, one for 
recyclable materials and the other for non-recyclables. Recyclables will be 
deposited in the green container and picked up twice a month. Non-recyclables 
in the black can will be picked up weekly. 
</P>
<P>
The recycling program, approved 4 to 1 by the City Council this week after 
seven months of review, was adopted in response to a recent state requirement 
that cities reduce garbage output by 25% before 1995 or risk fines of up to 
$10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something we've arrived at lightly, " said Councilwoman Barbara 
Downey. "A lot of serious thought went into finding a plan that would be best 
for citizens." 
</P>
<P>
However, Placentia resident Betty Mead told the City Council that the recycling 
program is unfair because households would no longer be able to haul their own 
trash to landfills instead of paying the monthly garbage fee. 
</P>
<P>
"People should not be forced to participate against their will," Mead said.

CHASE ENDS IN ARREST OF 3 AFTER LATEST JEWEL HEIST; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SANTA ANA ROBBERY FITS A PATTERN OF NEARLY 100 SIMILAR THEFTS IN THE 
WEST SINCE 1989. THE SUSPECTS MAY BE PART OF A LOS ANGELES COUNTY RING.

<P>
A freeway chase from Huntington Beach to Compton ended with the arrests of 
three men who allegedly robbed a department store jewelry counter at gunpoint, 
the latest in a series of Southland jewel heists, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
And although Orange County police were tight-lipped about investigations of two 
similar robberies in the last month, Los Angeles police said the incidents fit 
a pattern of nearly 100 similar thefts in the western United States since 1989 
that may stem from a criminal network in southwest Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem that's been going on for about 10 years in the Los Angeles 
area," said Lou Boozell, a longtime investigator with the Los Angeles Police 
Department's robbery and homicide bureau, who specializes in jewel thefts. "Now 
these people are hitting places in Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties, 
Northern California and other western states." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Virgil Kirkland Mahoney, 19, Jesse James Kirkland, 25, and 
Michael Taylor, 33, all of Los Angeles, were arrested Wednesday night at the 
Alondra Boulevard off-ramp of the Long Beach Freeway. Police said the car in 
which the men were riding crashed during a chase that reached speeds in excess 
of 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were being held in Orange County Jail on $50,000 bail each on 
charges of armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the suspects entered a Best Products Co. store on the 2800 block of 
Bristol Street in Santa Ana at 8:40 p.m., brandished a .38-caliber revolver and 
ordered employees not to move. 
</P>
<P>
After failed attempts at breaking into plexiglass jewelry cases, the men kicked 
in the backs of three cabinets and removed pieces set with precious gems, along 
with gold and silver jewelry, said Ed Medina, district loss prevention manager 
for Best Products Co. He did not know the value of the stolen merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The gun and an undisclosed amount of jewelry were found in the suspects' car, 
which had been reported stolen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach police began the chase at 9 p.m. on the San Diego Freeway near 
Beach Boulevard after an officer spotted a car traveling north that matched a 
description of the suspects' vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from Seal Beach and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
assisted in the arrest, and the suspects were turned over to Santa Ana police. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking to other agencies that have had similar robberies," said Santa 
Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. "It's not that often that the suspects 
are arrested in these cases, so it's a break for us." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Police Detective Don Shrum, however, was not as optimistic that the 
capture would help crack the growing number of jewelry store holdups. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne has had three such thefts in the last six weeks, Shrum said. Two 
nights ago, a Zales Jeweler in the Cerritos Mall was robbed in a similar 
fashion, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said, and others have occurred 
since November in Torrance and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, three men escaped last Friday afternoon with $450,000 in 
diamond jewelry from Black, Starr &amp; Frost jewelers in South Coast Plaza. 
Last month, two men were arrested for a robbery at another Best Products store 
in Huntington Beach, and in the last two years, more than a dozen jewel 
robberies were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"These people might have done this 25 times by the time they are caught," Shrum 
said, adding that Los Angeles County police agencies have file photographs of 
about 30 suspects arrested in jewel thefts, but that the charges against them 
are often dropped because witnesses are unable to positively identify the 
robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Boozell said operators of the alleged criminal network hire thieves off the 
streets in certain parts of Los Angeles. In most cases they hire men who wear 
nondescript clothing and drive stolen cars, he said. "It's like day workers who 
hang out waiting for somebody to come by and hire them to do landscaping or 
work construction," Boozell explained. "Except these people do robberies. Most 
don't know what job they are doing until 10 minutes before they do it." 
</P>
<P>
Agreed Shrum: "They're subcontractors who get paid for doing a job and 
delivering the take." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Detective Sgt. Ron Smith said authorities are investigating 
the possibility that the suspects in the South Coast Plaza incident could be 
the same as those in other robberies, or from the same ring of people.

CONDUCTOR SAYS ORCHESTRA RESCINDED JOB OFFER;

The conductor widely regarded as the front-runner for the job of music director 
for the Pacific Symphony said Thursday that the orchestra had offered him the 
job but withdrew the offer last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Foster, who conducts orchestras in Monte Carlo and Jerusalem, said 
talks with the Pacific began Dec. 23 but broke down over salary and his request 
for increased rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
"They offered me the job in December," Foster said from Los Angeles. "I had 
accepted. Negotiations went extremely far. Then the offer was dropped last 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Preston Stedman, head of the Pacific's search committee, would neither confirm 
nor deny Foster's account. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to comment on any statements that any candidates might make," 
Stedman said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said he had asked for a $150,000 salary for the orchestra's 1991-92 
season, which included conducting fees for concerts, an extra fee as music 
director and a travel allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Clark, the music director the orchestra is trying to replace, was paid 
$94,094 in 1989, his final year. Louis G. Spisto, the executive director who is 
now the top-paid employee of the orchestra, made $67,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them a total package," Foster said. "I was given to understand that the 
board regarded it as too exorbitant." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 48, said he had programmed the entire 1990-91 season for the 
organization in expectation that he would be hired. 
</P>
<P>
"I am brokenhearted," Foster said. "From the very beginning, I became extremely 
excited about the project. . . . But that is their right. It is their 
organization. I can't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has been auditioning guest conductors to replace Clark, who was 
forced out in February, 1988, after a bitter dispute with the board of 
directors over artistic direction and control of the orchestra he founded in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the pay issue, Foster said: "There was some distrust about my 
commitment to building the orchestra, that I am regarded as a European person 
and would not be sufficiently committed here." 
</P>
<P>
Foster lives in Monte Carlo, where he is in his last season as music director 
of the Orchestra Philharmonique de Monte Carlo. He said that while he will 
continue to keep his primary residence in Monte Carlo, he would be more than 
willing to commit himself to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Foster led the Pacific in September at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Last month, he conducted 
Mozart's "Le nozze di Figaro" for the Los Angeles Music Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to become music director of the Jerusalem Symphony in 1991; he 
is now music adviser to that orchestra. He said he did not expect that job to 
take him out of the running for the Pacific Symphony post. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said that conducting the Pacific is not a full-time job and that it is 
not uncommon for a music director to hold that position with more than one 
orchestra.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY BOARD VOTES 8TH SCHOOL CLOSURE 
</P>

<P>
About 200 parents watched in helpless outrage Thursday night as the Fountain 
Valley School District Board of Trustees voted to close the city's oldest 
elementary school because of low enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotionally charged meeting that lasted for two hours, about a dozen 
parents spoke against the proposed closure of Fountain Valley Elementary School 
-- and threatened legal action to keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, the board voted, 4-1, to close the school. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not let this die," parent Barbara Emerson said of the vote. "We will 
take it straight to court." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Stephen Einstein, who cast the dissenting vote, received a standing 
ovation from the audience when he told fellow board members that strong 
community opposition warrants re-evaluation of closure. 
</P>
<P>
"To hear parents attend every meeting with valid concerns over this matter made 
me think twice, and I believe the school should not be closed," he said. "But I 
do feel that each board member voted the way they felt best." 
</P>
<P>
The vote came after several months of heated debate between community members 
and officials of the school district, which has had a steady enrollment decline 
for the last 10 years. Seven schools have been closed in the area since 1979; 
many parents believe that one more is far too many. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel the board is listening to us or addressing our concerns," Cherie 
Dwhytie, a leader of the opposition group, said before Thursday night's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The group told board members that their concerns center on the lack of an 
environmental impact study by the district to determine what effect closing the 
eighth school in 10 years would have on the district. 
</P>
<P>
"They have not addressed how the increased traffic will affect our 
neighborhoods or our air," Dwhytie said. "Closing this school will overflow the 
other open schools, causing more traffic for them and forcing the cancellation 
of many programs for lack of space, not to mention what happens to people's 
home values when there isn't a neighborhood school." 
</P>
<P>
But board members say a school must be closed this year to compensate for the 
loss of money from the state because of dwindling enrollment. Fountain Valley 
Elementary School, with just 302 pupils, is the obvious choice, board members 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
The board's decision means that the school's pupils will be relocated to three 
other schools -- whichever one is one mile from their home or nearer, according 
to district officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to know what happens when the population begins to climb," said Carol 
Barnes, a member of the opposition group. "Our figures show that the birthrate 
is beginning to do just that. But will there be schools for them?"

ALL'S QUIET ON FRUIT FLY FRONT -- FOR THE MOMENT; 
</P>
<P>
MEDFLY: PROLIFIC PEST HASN'T BEEN SIGHTED FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT OFFICIALS SAY WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF IT YET. THE RETURN OF WARM WEATHER MAY BRING IT BACK 
IN FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks have passed since any Medflies have been trapped in Southern 
California, but officials battling the pest say this is not yet cause for great 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
The lull, they say, can be attributed to the colder weather, which slows the 
fly's activities, coupled with the results of aerial malathion spraying. This 
has allowed officials to begin turning their attention to the spring when, as 
past infestations have shown, the pest could return in full force with the 
advent of warm weather. 
</P>
<P>
So far in Orange County, Mediterranean fruit flies have turned up in Brea, 
Westminster and Garden Grove. The first Medfly was found Nov. 17 in a Brea 
guava tree, while the most recent sighting was Jan. 10 in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"The real test will come in the spring," Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of 
the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The state plans to counter the pest's expected spring offensive with increased 
malathion spraying, beginning in April. Millions of sterile Medflies, which 
have been in short supply, are expected to be shipped to the region in record 
numbers by May. 
</P>
<P>
And on the political front, a veritable swarm of state and county officials 
have already mounted a meet-the-people campaign to explain the eradication 
program and plead for more public cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Rice, a professor of entomology at UC Davis and a member of the 
science advisory panel overseeing the state's eradication program, said there 
is no way to tell how big a resurgence the flies will make and if the state has 
done enough to prepare for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, we're waiting for the other shoe to drop," Rice said. "We hope it 
will be a real soft tennis shoe, but maybe it will be a big, heavy boot." 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the slowdown in fly discoveries was expected. The cold weather 
extends the life cycle of the fly from about 30 days to as long as four months, 
meaning the pest breeds less and the population drops. But as the temperature 
goes up and fruit crops appear in spring and summer, conditions will again be 
good for the fly to breed prolifically. 
</P>
<P>
The first stage in the state's spring eradication program will be more 
intensive aerial spraying. Currently, infested areas are sprayed once every 21 
days. That will increase to once every 15 days in April, and then every seven 
days in June, Siddiqui said. 
</P>
<P>
By May, the state will also begin a far more ambitious plan to breed the Medfly 
out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
At best, the state has been able to get about 80 million sterile Medflies a 
week from a U.S. Department of Agriculture breeding facility in Hawaii. But two 
new facilities in that state are expected to begin shipping about 200 million 
flies a week by May, and the rate could go as high as 400 million by June, 
Siddiqui said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get 400 million we should pretty much be able to phase out aerial 
spraying, except in areas with new finds," he said. "Getting those flies is our 
top priority." 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the shipments of sterile flies are important to help blunt the 
growing political opposition to aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Garden Grove, Huntington Beach and Westminster filed suit against 
the state last month to stop the spraying campaign. State Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles) introduced two bills last month that would effectively stop the 
state's aerial campaign by banning repeated malathion spraying and requiring 
proof of the safety and effectiveness of the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
Cities from Brea to Duarte have passed resolutions demanding an end to aerial 
malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the opposition, state officials have pressed a public relations 
campaign. Last week, officials announced the creation of a malathion health 
advisory panel that will have the dual mission of advising the state on the 
possible health implications of the pesticide spraying and educating the public 
on its findings. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which could begin meeting this month, will be made up of Southern 
California health professionals, as well as local physicians, university 
specialists and poison control experts. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Siddiqui and other state officials will begin holding weekly 
briefings to keep the media informed of the eradication campaign's progress. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said the department also has launched a renewed effort to talk with 
local elected officials who, he conceded, were poorly informed by the 
department during the early, frantic days of the eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't doing it as methodically as we'd like," he said. "Now that we have 
stabilized the situation, we'll reestablish contact."

BASEBALL OWNERS TRYING TO SELL PLAN TO UNION FINDING NO REASON TO BUY 
</P>

<P>
A lockout of spring training camps by baseball's owners is designed to force 
the Major League Players Assn. to accept their revenue-sharing plan, but it 
figures to be the owners who will capitulate in this collective bargaining 
impasse. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in that capitulation could come during their meeting in Chicago 
today, with the owners possibly extending their Feb. 15 deadline for a 
revenue-sharing agreement and the closing of camps to late February or early 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Or, more likely, they could maintain the Feb. 15 deadline, leaving it to 
Commissioner Fay Vincent to intercede eventually, ordering the camps to be 
opened. Vincent, who met with management and union representatives Wednesday 
night, has said that it is not his style to issue an order amid a negotiating 
process, but he would not rule it out. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the owners -- unable to convince the players or public 
that they face financial jeopardy now or in the future -- eventually will have 
to accept the status quo for another three or four years, giving a joint 
committee that was formed during the negotiations Monday a chance to take a 
hard look at revenue sharing and come up with an acceptable format. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing in the current package acceptable to a union conditioned to 
ultimatums, and it is unlikely that a prolonged lockout would change that -- or 
starve the players, who have pooled their licensing money as a hedge against a 
stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a review of the elements that mitigate against an owner victory: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The current proposal would force the union to yield rights already won in 
collective bargaining. It would eliminate arbitration for players with six or 
fewer years of major league service, besides eliminating guaranteed and 
multiyear contracts for players in that category. It would also modify free 
agency by imposing a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The statistical scale by which the salaries of players in the zero to 
six-year category would be determined fails to consider defense, character and 
a wide variety of intangible contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By setting aside 48% of their gate and TV-radio income for salaries, the 
owners have offered only 39% of their total income and would have to go to 62% 
of the gate and TV-radio income to match what players in the NBA get through 
revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those substantial hurdles in the proposal, the general 
atmosphere weighs against the owners, and much of that is their own fault. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about the need for a radical change in the compensation system, but 
they send salaries skyrocketing, paying so much money up front that, to an 
extent, they have defeated themselves by removing the players' financial risk 
in event of a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about the damaging revenue disparity between teams in the big and 
small markets, but they can't define the disparity's depth. In addition, there 
has been no evidence that big-market teams such as the Dodgers, Angels, New 
York's Yankees and Mets and Chicago's White Sox and Cubs will dominate the 
pennant races. And, in fact, teams in the small markets remain among the most 
financially active, as illustrated by the Kansas City Royals' signing of free 
agents Mark Davis and Storm Davis; the Seattle Mariners signing of free agent 
Pete O'Brien, and the Minnesota Twins re-signing of Kent Hrbek for $14 million 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
They talk about financial peril, yet the industry has never been more popular 
or prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
The major leagues set an attendance record for the fifth consecutive year in 
1989, drawing more than 55 million. Industry revenue in 1988, the last full 
accounting, was more than $1.1 billion. Continued growth is assured through new 
TV contracts, increased licensing, the response to competitive parity, new 
stadiums in Toronto, Chicago and Baltimore and increased ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
It is now expected that all major league teams -- buoyed by the new TV 
contracts -- will be grossing a minimum of $40 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The reality of revenue sharing is that the owners are trying to sell a familiar 
story, hoping the players will help create a system that will protect the 
owners from their own greed and ego. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, it won't work. The union will simply not approve a proposal that 
would lower salaries and eliminate the market. 
</P>
<P>
The owners must know it. And they must know that a prolonged lockout would 
produce a further disrupting legal challenge by the union. The evidence points 
to capitulation. The question is when? 
</P>
<P>
The owners, in that regard, will try to do a better job of saving face than 
they have done saving on salaries.

STEINBRENNER SAYS HE DOESN'T BUY OWNERS' 'SMALL-MARKET' ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
While it is apparent that major league baseball's 26 club owners are united in 
their plan to announce a spring training lockout today, it is less clear how 
long they will continue to agree. 
</P>
<P>
George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York Yankees, said Thursday 
that although he supports the action to be implemented by the Player Relations 
Committee, he is annoyed by his fellow owners' arguments in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the other owners are looking for a cop-out, looking for an excuse," 
Steinbrenner said. "I'm tired of hearing about all these guys in small markets 
crying about how much the so-called rich teams are making. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, I'm in total support of the lockout plan, but don't look 
at me while you're crying about rising salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a look at the top 10 salaries these days, will you? Do you see any 
Yankees in there? Do you see any Mets, or Dodgers or Cubs? Except for (Mark) 
Langston (of the Angels), all of the big contracts belong to the smaller 
markets. So when I hear guys like (Ewing) Kauffman (of the Kansas City Royals) 
crying, I want to say, 'Give me a break.' 
</P>
<P>
"I hope someone at the meeting does speak up and starts crying about being in a 
small market and how unfair it is. I'll tell them exactly what's on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner is the first owner to criticize any aspect of the lockout plan 
that the PRC insists will be in place until the Major League Players Assn. 
agrees to a proposal for an overhaul of baseball's revenue and salary system. 
</P>
<P>
The necessity for a revenue-sharing program, according to Milwaukee Brewer 
owner Bud Selig, chairman of the PRC, is to prevent the small marketplaces from 
being at a disadvantage in the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
"I never believed, coming from a small market, that revenue sharing is a 
panacea," Selig said, "but the PRC has come up with an extremely skillful way 
of assuring competitive franchises in all sizes of markets." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, beginning this season, will receive $50 million a season for the 
next 10 years from their local TV package with the Madison Square Garden 
Network. They also have a lucrative radio contract, boosting the value of their 
local broadcasting revenue package to more than $60 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the teams in baseball's three-smallest markets -- Kansas City, 
Milwaukee and Minnesota -- each receive less than $5 million in local 
broadcasting revenue. Beginning in 1990, all major league clubs will receive 
$15.24 million per season from a four-year network television package. 
</P>
<P>
If the large markets are to have such an advantage, Steinbrenner asks, then why 
have the Yankees, Mets, Cubs, White Sox, Dodgers and Angels been to just four 
World Series among them since the 1979 season? 
</P>
<P>
"They all like to point to New York, Chicago and California," Steinbrenner 
said, "but I'm tired of it. They point to us because we're an easy target. We 
have the big TV contract, and that takes the heat off the culprits. They're 
blaming the Yankees, but Kansas City, San Francisco, Oakland and the Angels are 
the big culprits. These guys are crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"And go look at what (Giant General Manager) Al Rosen gave Will Clark for two 
years before Clark could be a free agent. That's stupid business. But then, he 
never was a bright businessman." 
</P>
<P>
Rosen formerly was a Yankee executive under Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels signed free-agent pitcher Langston to a five-year, $16-million 
contract on Dec. 1; the Giants signed Clark to a four-year, $15-million 
contract; the Athletics signed pitcher Dave Stewart to a two-year, $7-million 
contract extension in January; and the Royals signed free-agent reliever Mark 
Davis to a four-year, $13-million contract and free-agent starter Storm Davis 
to a three-year, $6-million contract in December. 
</P>
<P>
Said Royal General Manager John Schuerholz: "We have an owner who put up a lot 
of money out of his own pocket. Mr Steinbrenner confuses the issue. The fact of 
the matter is, it was not money generated by the club." 
</P>
<P>
Kauffman, who recently sold $700 million of Marion Laboratories stock in Kansas 
City, said: "The way I figured it, we were going to lose money anyway with a 
ballclub that wasn't going to be all that good. So I said, 'If we're going to 
lose money anyway, we might as well sign Davis and Davis. We'll be losing a 
paramount amount of money, but at least we'll have a winning team.' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it one bit, but the only way we're going to keep up with the New 
Yorks and L. A.'s is to spend a lot of money, and that's what we're being 
forced to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The only difference is that, while we're losing our shirts, they're making 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Said Jeff Smulyan, chairman of the board of the Seattle Mariners: "It's got to 
be a game for everybody. If there are cities that can't keep up, it no longer 
can be the national pastime. I don't think there's any great mystery about the 
large disparity of revenue in our game."

MIKE PENNER: LOGIC A LOSER IN ARBITRATION RULINGS

They are the only major league games likely to be played for some time, and the 
Angels are playing them the same way they usually handle the real thing. Win 
one, lose one. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitration season opened this week with Mike Port taking on his two most 
talented players, Wally Joyner and Devon White, behind closed doors. Through 
the blood, the sweat and the tears, Port emerged with a hard-fought 1-1 split, 
losing to the first baseman before bouncing back in a big way against the 
center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Just as easily, though, Port could have gone 0-2. Or 2-0. The hows and whys of 
the arbitration process, like the Jose Canseco Hotline, are things that may be 
never fully understood or explained. Next to the coin toss in football, 
baseball arbitration has to be the most imperfect science in all of sports. 
</P>
<P>
And the coin toss, at least, is governed by principles of gravity and physics. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitration rulings tend to just happen, out of thin air and thinner logic. 
</P>
<P>
How does Bo Jackson hit 32 home runs, drive in 105 runs, steal 26 bases and the 
1989 All-Star Game . . . and come out of arbitration earning $400,000 less than 
Lloyd Moseby? 
</P>
<P>
How does Joyner drop from .292 to .285 in batting average, from 85 to 79 in 
RBIs, from 176 to 167 in hits . . . and receive a raise of $830,000? 
</P>
<P>
How does White win a second Gold Glove, steal 44 bases, earn a spot on the 
American League All-Star team . . . and walk away with less pay than pitcher 
Zane Smith, who won one game in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
One game. Between Atlanta and Montreal last season, Smith went 1-13 in 17 
starts and 31 relief appearances. For that, Smith will be paid $660,000 in 1990 
-- or $80,000 more than White. 
</P>
<P>
If he ever wins two, the Expos will have to raise ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
From this view, timing is the all-important constant in arbitration. Bo went 
first and lost. Joyner went next and won. Then came White. Yep, another defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who thinks Joyner ought to be making $750,000 more than Bo this year, 
raise your hand. 
</P>
<P>
Not you, Wally. 
</P>
<P>
Bo should either get himself a new agent or a new ego. His arbitration figure 
was a cheeky $1,900,001, the extra dollar in place so Bo could claim to be 
better paid than Ruben Sierra. Sierra, of course, batted 50 points higher than 
Bo, drove in 14 more runs and had 90 fewer strikeouts. No player in the 
American League had a better season than Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
So, with Bo, pride went before practicality. Realizing that he had filed far 
too high, his employers in Kansas City came in low, at an even $1 million. Had 
Bo been willing to settle for the humble sum of $1.5 million, or even $1.6 
million, he probably wouldn't have left with a smaller salary than Ernie ($1.2 
million) Whitt. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bo had to hang on to his moonlight with the L.A. Raiders for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If Joyner had lost his arbitration hearing, he'd still have been earning 
$225,000 more than Bo. Wonder what might have happened if Joyner had been 
scheduled first. Or, if Andres Galarraga hadn't just signed a three-year 
contract that will pay him $1.7 million in 1990. Galarraga, Montreal's first 
baseman, batted .257 with 85 RBIs and 147 hits last season. Compare his numbers 
to Joyner's and, sure, Wally deserves the same ballpark figure. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, Joyner will make the same base salary in 1990 as San 
Francisco's Will Clark. Clark batted .333 with 23 home runs and 111 RBIs last 
season. He was MVP of the National League playoffs. Many are starting to call 
Clark the best player in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner is the best player in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Wally can't stop smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Wally's award retribution for past affronts, back pay due him after 
the shafts of 1987 and 1988. Without the leverage of arbitration, Joyner got 
beaten up and beaten down, beaten all around, following his first two 
outstanding seasons. 
</P>
<P>
As a rookie in 1986, Joyner hit .290 with 22 home runs and 100 RBIs, led the 
Angels to the AL West championship and was narrowly outpointed by Canseco for 
AL rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Angels told Joyner to take $165,000 and be happy with it. 
</P>
<P>
That season, Joyner had one of the greatest offensive seasons in Angel history 
-- .285, 34 home runs, 117 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels renewed him at $340,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Joyner finally gained arbitration eligibility. His salary jumped 
to $920,000. And this spring, Joyner finally took the Angels to arbitration. 
His salary nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
This is why arbitration has become a focal point of the present Basic Agreement 
bargaining mess. The owners want to kill arbitration. The players want more of 
it, slicing the eligibility requisite from three full major league seasons to 
two. 
</P>
<P>
With Joyner as the new case study, the players figure they'd be better off 
holding out until June than giving one inch on the arbitration issue. It can be 
exasperating; there are tales of arbitrators asking the definition of slugging 
percentages and save opportunities. It can be demoralizing; Gary Pettis once 
sat in on a losing session and took the obligatory slagging so personally, he 
sulked through all of spring training. But, from the players' standpoint, it 
sure beats the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Even as losers, Jackson and White received hefty pay hikes. Jackson went from 
$610,000 to $1 million, White from $320,000 to $580,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next up for the Angels: Kirk McCaskill, scheduled for Feb. 19 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Between then and now, McCaskill has to be hoping for a few more player defeats.

NEW TWIST: MALONE TO SKIP ALL-STAR GAME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Utah forward Karl Malone, after twisting his ankle with five minutes left in 
the Jazz' 94-74 victory over the Charlotte Hornets Thursday night, said he 
would not play in the All-Star game Sunday at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, who earlier threatened to boycott the game because the Lakers' A. C. 
Green was selected to start over him, remained in the game at Charlotte long 
after victory was clinched. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go down there with a sprained ankle," said Malone, who went to a 
hospital for X-rays 30 minutes after the game. "I'm not going down there and 
stand around the whole time. That doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Utah trainer Don Sparks said he would put a soft cast on the ankle and examine 
it again today. 
</P>
<P>
Malone did not have a good game against the Hornets, who lost their ninth in a 
row and 16th in their last 17. Malone played 36 minutes and had only 15 points, 
going six of 18 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz struggled early, but Thurl Bailey came off the bench to score 22 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 104, Milwaukee 101 -- With Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre leading a 
fourth-quarter surge at Milwaukee, the Pistons stretched their winning streak 
to nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas had 10 of his 23 points in the last 12 minutes, and Aguirre had 11 of 
his 15 in the same span. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 105, San Antonio 100 -- The Pacers, who struggled for the past month 
after a great start, ended the Spurs' 20-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting of Chuck Person and Reggie Miller enabled the Pacers to beat the 
Spurs for the eighth time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Person had 32 points on 13-of-19 shooting, and Miller had 28. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson had 21 points and eight rebounds for the Spurs, who are 22-2 at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 123, Chicago 98 -- The Nuggets, playing at home, held Michael Jordan to 
15 points, his lowest total of the season. Alex English, who engaged in a 
shouting match with Coach Doug Moe during an overtime loss to Indiana Tuesday 
night, led the Nuggets with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had only one basket in the second half and was only five of 18 from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 110, Houston 108 -- Moses Malone sank a 16-foot jump shot with two 
seconds left at Houston to end the Hawks' six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Malone had 21 points and 14 rebounds. Akeem Olajuwon had 27 points and 15 
rebounds for Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 101, Philadelphia 99 -- Reggie Theus made an 18-foot jump shot with one 
second left to lead the Magic at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic is 4-1 in games it has held opponents to less than 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 106, Miami 82 -- The Heat, playing without flu-stricken center Rony 
Seikaly, was no match for the Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Price scored 18 points for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
New York 122, Golden State 118 -- Mitch Richmond led a furious Warriors' rally 
that cut a 20-point deficit to four points with three minutes left, but they 
couldn't get any closer to the Knicks at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond had 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 90, Minnesota 77 -- Rolando Blackman scored 21 points at Dallas and the 
Mavericks pulled away in the second half. DAN HAFNER

HAYES, BING, MONROE IN HALL OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: NEIL JOHNSTON, A SCORING CHAMPION IN THE 1950S, IS ALSO SELECTED 
FOR MAY 15 INDUCTION.

<P>
Elvin Hayes, Dave Bing and Earl (The Pearl) Monroe were elected to the 
Basketball Hall of Fame on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also chosen was the late Neil Johnston, the Philadelphia Warriors' hook-shot 
artist who led the NBA in scoring for three consecutive seasons in the early 
1950s. All will be inducted on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who starred at the University of Houston in the late '60s and ended his 
16-year NBA career as the league's third-leading all-time scorer, said making 
the Hall of Fame is a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just unreal," Hayes said. "It's just like winning your first high school 
basketball championship or your first NBA championship. It's just one of those 
feelings. You work so hard and have your dreams and then it happens." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who played for the Rockets in San Diego and Houston, and the Bullets in 
Baltimore and Washington, was the NBA rookie of the year in 1969, when he led 
the league with 28.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 21 points and nearly 12.5 rebounds a game for his career and was 
named to 12 All-Star teams. He was the league's top rebounder in 1970 and 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, rookie of the year for Baltimore in 1967-68, averaged 18.8 points in 12 
seasons with the Bullets and New York Knicks, who he helped to the 1973 NBA 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Bing was rookie of the year in 1966-67 with the Detroit Pistons. He led the 
league in scoring, averaging 27 points a game the next season. He averaged 20 
points and nearly six assists during his 12-year career with Detroit, 
Washington and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
During eight seasons with Philadelphia, Johnston led the NBA in scoring in 
1952-53 and 1953-54 and in both scoring and rebounding in 1954-55. He was named 
to six All-Star teams before a knee injury ended his career in 1959.

MIKAN LOBBIES FOR NBA TO EXPAND TO ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're trying to get the attention of basketball people, you could do a lot 
worse than have George Mikan plead your case. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Basketball, as he became known during his Hall of Fame career, is 
negotiating to bring either an existing National Basketball Assn. team or a 
National Hockey League franchise to Anaheim, where a 20,000-seat, $85-million 
indoor sports arena is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent expansion by the NBA to 27 teams, Mikan said Thursday that 
he also is lobbying for a 28th team, to play in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Mikan, 65, played an integral role in bringing the expansion Minnesota 
Timberwolves to Minneapolis in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the former Minneapolis Laker center formed Major League Sports 
Franchises, Inc., to assist those interested in relocating or starting sports 
franchises. His efforts include an unsuccessful bid last fall to purchase the 
Winnipeg Jets and move them to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of cities have been contacting us, but our No. 1 priority is Anaheim," 
Mikan said. Mikan said his inquiries on behalf of an Orange County investors' 
group to purchase an existing basketball franchise have found the asking price 
-- which he declined to reveal -- to be high. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't seem to deter our people," Mikan said of the investors, whom 
he also declined to identify. "Our investors prefer not to go public yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This is all preliminary, but we have real big interests from the hockey area." 
</P>
<P>
Mikan also declined to identify the franchises with whom he is negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what happens in a town if they start speaking about leaving," he 
said. "They lose fan support." 
</P>
<P>
Mikan said competing efforts to lure NBA or NHL teams to a nearly identical 
arena proposed to be built in Santa Ana have complicated matters. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always a problem when there are a lot of suitors," he said.

SOUTH TORRANCE SUSPENDS COACH FOR PULLING TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Torrance High girls basketball Coach Gil Ramirez was suspended by the 
school Thursday for the rest of the season for violating the Southern Section 
sportsmanship rule. Ramirez pulled his team off the court at halftime Wednesday 
with his team trailing Inglewood Morningside, 102-24. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez's action prevented Morningside's 6-foot-5 senior center Lisa Leslie, 
who scored 101 points in the first half, from breaking the national record of 
105 points set by Cheryl Miller of Riverside Poly against Norte Vista in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance (3-17) completes the regular season this afternoon with an Ocean 
League game against visiting North Torrance. Assistant coach Ron Omoto will 
serve as coach, said South Torrance's principal, Dr. John Schmitt. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who met with Schmitt and his players at school Thursday, refused to 
comment on his decision to remove his team at halftime. South Torrance was down 
to four players because two of the team's seven players had fouled out in the 
first half and one could not play because of an injury, Schmitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked with the (Southern Section office) and we are forwarding an incident 
report," Schmitt said. "We are also forwarding a letter of concern for them to 
react to. We are well aware of the (sportsmanship) rule. I think it needs some 
interpretation in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Lopsided Ocean League victories are common for Morningside, the defending State 
Division I champions. Morningside Coach Frank Scott said that Wednesday's game 
was the first time he let the Monarchs (21-3) loose all season.

OC MARINES MAKE IT THEIR DUTY TO PLAY THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: WHEN SOLDIERS FROM EL TORO AND TUSTIN MILITARY BASES AREN'T WORKING 
OR 'FIGHTING COMMUNISM' AT SEA, THEY TAKE TO THE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
And you thought your favorite basketball coach had problems. Consider the 
difficulties Sgt. Maj. Chris Crawford, coach of the Marine Corps helicopter-air 
station team in Tustin, and Gunnery Sgt. James Palmer, coach of El Toro's 
Marine Corps air station team, have faced this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the season started in September, two Tustin starters were on duty at 
sea "fighting communism," as Crawford is fond of saying. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At a recent practice, Crawford's squad was forced into a half-court 
workout. The El Toro Marine women's team, which shares the one-court gym at El 
Toro with the El Toro and Tustin men's teams, also was practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because of duty assignments and work commitments, Palmer had only six 
players available for a game against the San Diego Marine Corps team in 
December. El Toro still won, 87-83. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Marine Corps basketball, where fielding a competitive team is a 
constant struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really frustrating," Palmer said. "But being Marines, we're used to 
making do with what we have." 
</P>
<P>
What they have is little time, but plenty of heart, the coaches said. "Most of 
the time the guys are going on guts, sheer guts," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (10-12) and Tustin (4-8), which play area community colleges and other 
military teams, are struggling this season. Such records can make a Marine 
basketball player's long day even longer. A typical day consists of work from 
7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Two or three times a week, one-hour practices are 
squeezed in after hours. 
</P>
<P>
Players and coaches said attempting to compete with colleges, given their 
limited time, is difficult. Games are played at night and on weekends, which 
can also be a strain on players with families. Why such dedication? 
</P>
<P>
"We love it," Crawford said. "We love the sport and we love the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cpl. Kevin Calhoun, a 23-year-old who plays on the El Toro team: "In the 
military, you go to work, do the same job every day, wear the same uniform. It 
(basketball) gets your mind off the military for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Staff Sgt. Rodney Sanders, a 30-year-old teammate of Calhoun's, enjoys showing 
the young guys a thing or two. "For a lot of us, this is the highest level 
we're able to see," said Sanders, who's from Detroit. "A lot of the guys act 
like they're prima donnas. I like to put something on them." 
</P>
<P>
Players on the two teams come in a variety of shapes, sizes and skill levels. 
Ages range from 17 to 30, and while most have high school experience, others 
did not begin playing competitively until they joined the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
However, Long Beach College Coach Bill Fraser, who has played several military 
teams during his 17 years at the school, said all share one trait: a passion 
for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They compete because they're competitors, not because anything is being held 
in front of them like a carrot, like a league championship," Fraser said. "They 
play because they like to play." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not to say, stressed Fraser, that the Marine teams are not talented. 
Indeed, several players stand out.

Fraser said El Toro's Calhoun, who scored 28 points against Long Beach Jan. 30, 
could compete at the community college level. The 6-foot-1 Calhoun, of Anaheim, 
is a quick player with a textbook left-handed jump shot. Although he has only 
one year of high school experience, he hopes to play college basketball when he 
leaves the military in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Darrin Bussell, a 24-year-old guard from Hopkinsville, Ky., "makes the 
team go," assistant coach Staff Sgt. Arthur Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's top player is Cpl. Jerome Marsh, a 21-year-old from Pittsburgh. At a 
practice last week, the 6-2 Marsh put on a dunking display that would make some 
college players envious. Marsh said he played two years at Waynesburg College, 
a Division II school in Pennsylvania, before "financial trouble" forced him to 
join the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said Marsh, like many other military players, is talented enough to 
play college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the talent," he said. "It's because of their grades, or maybe they 
just didn't have the opportunity to go to school. There's no doubt they have 
the ability." 
</P>
<P>
Still, military teams have trouble getting respect from community college 
opponents and fans, players said. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at us and say, 'That's just some little military team, they can't 
play ball,' " Marsh said. "That's just not true. We like to go in a gym, play 
hard and leave with some respect." 
</P>
<P>
The teams are entertaining to watch. Tustin has scored 100 points once and 97 
twice. El Toro has scored 100 points five times, including a 125-101 loss to 
Long Beach. But don't describe El Toro's offense as run-and-gun, said Palmer. 
His team runs to offset a lack of height. 
</P>
<P>
"Other teams look at us and smile because we're not very large," he said. "We 
get the job done. If a team isn't ready to run, they're going to be in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the losing records, now is an exciting time for the Marine teams. The 
West Coast Regional, one of three Marine regional tournaments, will be held 
Feb. 12-15 at the Marine Corps logistics base in Barstow. El Toro and Tustin 
will play six other squads for the right to call themselves the best Marine 
team west of Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's our Final Four," Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches are reluctant to predict their team's chances. No matter where 
Tustin finishes, Crawford said he will have no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be better with more practice time, but we're not bitter," he said. "We're 
just happy to be playing on this level at all. We're Marines. The duty comes 
first."

RHYTHM STILL HAS PLENTY TO PROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although Rhythm won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last year and was voted the 
champion 2-year-old colt by the Eclipse Awards electorate, he has more to prove 
than some of the horses that finished behind him in both the race and ballot 
box. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm was the shakiest of Eclipse winners, not polling the most total votes 
but finishing No. 1 in a bloc-voting system that was barely able to separate 
him from his other rivals, Grand Canyon and Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm's only stakes victory came in the Breeders' Cup, his fifth and final 
start as a 2-year-old. Grand Canyon, second by two lengths in the Breeders' 
Cup, wound up with stakes wins at Santa Anita, Churchill Downs and Hollywood 
Park and outpolled Rhythm and undefeated Summer Squall, the winner of four 
stakes who missed the Breeders' race because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne, you wuz robbed," Don Clippinger wrote recently in the The Thoroughbred 
Record, referring to Wayne Lukas, trainer of Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythm is trained by Shug McGaughey, who last year at this time had another 
2-year-old champion, Easy Goer, in his barn. That's the extent of the 
similarity, because in Easy Goer, McGaughey knew he had an exceptional colt, 
who had the misfortune to be foaled in the same year as Sunday Silence. The 
Eastern press raved about Easy Goer before he got to the Kentucky Derby, but 
the projections for Rhythm, both from turf writers and the trainer, are 
considerably more circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
Others are also apprehensive. For Rhythm's debut as a 3-year-old, in the 
seven-furlong Hutcheson Stakes on Saturday at Gulfstream Park, the track 
linemaker has installed him as a mild 5-2 favorite, even though the race will 
be run over the same surface on which the colt won in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Second choice in the 12-horse field is Housebuster at 3-1. Housebuster's 
stamina for the longer Triple Crown races is questionable, but he's dangerous 
at the Hutcheson distance, having already won a six-furlong stake at Gulfstream 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon is in training at Santa Anita and won't meet Rhythm again until 
Kentucky. Summer Squall also is in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Three of trainer Charlie Whittingham's seven Santa Anita Handicap winners -- 
Pretense, Ack Ack and Lord at War -- also won the San Antonio Handicap. 
Whittingham has the potential for another such double, running Ruhlmann and 
Payant on Sunday in the $300,000 San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann will be the high-weighted starter at 122 pounds and Payant has drawn 
117 pounds. Their running styles put Whittingham in a good position. Ruhlmann 
has early speed and Payant likes to come from well off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who carries 120 pounds, is also expected to start, along with 
Criminal Type, Complicate, Hollywood Reporter and Stylish Winner. 
</P>
<P>
A successful 1989 means talented mare Bayakoa must carry 127 pounds instead of 
118 in the Santa Margarita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Santa Margarita was seven stakes wins and one Eclipse Award ago for 
Bayakoa. Last year, Bayakoa was spotted seven pounds by Goodbye Halo, who 
finished second to her in the stake. This year, Bayakoa is the high weight and 
must give two pounds to Gorgeous and considerably more to any other horses in a 
small field. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa carried 126 pounds and Gorgeous 125 when both horses easily won Santa 
Margarita prep races at Santa Anita last weekend, and Ron McAnally, who trains 
Bayakoa, had hoped that the spread would be the same when they have their 
showdown a week from Sunday. Bayakoa is attempting to become the first 
back-to-back winner of the Santa Margarita since Tizna in 1974-75. 
</P>
<P>
California's 3-year-olds make another attempt to sort themselves out Saturday 
when six run in the San Vicente Breeders' Cup Stakes at Santa Anita. Entered in 
the seven-furlong race are Farma Way, Top Cash, Phantom X., Leading Laddie, 
Tarascon and Mister Frisky, who makes his American debut after winning 13 
consecutive races in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Ron Hansen's dual appeal for stays of an order banning him from Golden 
Gate Fields was denied on separate fronts Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Chavez, chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, allowed Golden 
Gate's ban of Hansen to remain in effect, at least until a hearing can be 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
And in Alameda County Superior Court, Hansen was denied a temporary restraining 
order at Golden Gate, with his hearing to be continued on Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports that Hansen might ride quarter horses at Bay Meadows this 
weekend, but he is not named on horses at Bay Meadows for tonight or Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The unfortunate part about Bill Shoemaker's last ride is that after the day -- 
and the race -- were specifically orchestrated for the convenience of ABC 
television, the network could squeeze in only about seven minutes on its "Wide 
World of Sports" program, which was dominated by boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Left on the cutting-room floor were several prepared pieces on Shoemaker's 
career. The telecast is just the umpteenth example of the historically 
difficult relationship racing has had with television. 
</P>
<P>
The night before Shoemaker's last ride, the 58-year-old jockey was honored at a 
charity dinner that included Bob Hope. Two of Hope's better lines: 
</P>
<P>
"People who play golf with Shoe are always worried that they're going to lose 
him in the hole." 
</P>
<P>
"When Shoe was born, he was so small that the doctor went to slap him and 
missed." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Eclipse Awards will be presented tonight at a dinner in Miami Beach, Fla. . 
. . Kent Desormeaux, who will pick up his statuette for best jockey, begins 
riding at Santa Anita next week. A week from Monday, Desormeaux will be riding 
in Saudi Arabia, where Steve Cauthen once made a celebrity appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Ferraro has been reappointed by Gov. Deukmejian to another four-year 
term on the California Horse Racing Board. A new board member is John La 
Follette, a San Fernando Valley attorney who starts a four-year term as a 
replacement for Ray Seeley. 
</P>
<P>
John Henry, who is eligible for the first time, is a cinch to be elected to 
racing's Hall of Fame. There is a good chance that his trainer, Ron McAnally, 
also could get elected, should he wind up on the ballot.

Debbie Fischer scored a school-record 49 points, broke the Southern Section 
records for career and season three-pointers and tied her single-game Southern 
Section record with 10 three-point baskets to lead Edison High School to a 
88-33 victory over Westminster in a Sunset League girls' basketball game 
Thursday at Edison.

Fischer's 10 three-pointers tied the record she set in December against Corona.

She also broke her school single-game record of 40 points.

"I guess somewhere somebody had 12 three-pointers in a game and it wasn't 
reported, so we wanted Debbie to have a chance (to be the undisputed 
record-holder)," Edison coach Philip Abraham said. "In third quarter, I said to 
my assistant coaches . . . let her go for it (12). I said to her, 'Debbie you 
have eight three pointers" because she didn't know."

"The third quarter was really great for me. After I hit two (three-pointers) I 
said, 'Give me the ball!' " Fischer said. ARA NAJARIANFountain Valley 51,

DISNEY ORDERS THEATERS TO DROP ON-SCREEN ADS; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE STUDIO SAYS IT WILL PULL ITS MOVIES FROM EXHIBITORS THAT 
FAIL TO COMPLY. THE BAN IS APPARENTLY A FIRST FOR THE INDUSTRY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Disney Co., in a get-tough move aimed at movie exhibitors, said it will 
stop showing its films in any theater that runs on-screen advertising with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The ban is apparently the first such move by a major movie studio. It includes 
advertising by newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, which for about 40 
years has run promotional spots on movie screens in exchange for discount rates 
on movie directory listings in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
On-screen advertising "is a turn-off. Audiences don't like it. They hate it," 
said Richard Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista distribution unit. 
</P>
<P>
On announcing the new policy Thursday at the ShoWest exhibitors' convention in 
Las Vegas, Cook was greeted with applause by some theater owners, but others 
responded angrily to what they saw as high-handed behavior by the studio. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't keep raising ticket prices to offset increasing costs. . . . This is 
a very serious problem," Allen Karp, president of Cineplex Odeon Corp., said of 
the Disney move. Cineplex, which is 49%-owned by MCA Inc., parent of Universal 
Pictures, is among the biggest theater chains that regularly use advertising. 
Karp said he was talking with Disney about a "mutually acceptable" way of 
meeting the studio's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney thinks it's swinging a pretty big bat right now," said another theater 
manager, who declined to be identified. He said he received a letter from 
Disney on Wednesday telling him not to bother bidding on "Pretty Woman," a 
Disney film set for distribution in March, if his chain wasn't prepared to 
comply with the advertising policy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest purveyors of on-screen advertising is New York-based 
Screenvision Cinema Network, which claims to have placed ads on about 6,000 of 
the nation's approximately 23,000 theater screens. Screenvision officers didn't 
return calls seeking comment on the Disney move. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by the desirable demographics of movie-going audiences, companies have 
turned to on-screen advertising for products such as Toyota and Mitsubishi 
automobiles, Kodak film and Dr Pepper soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has put a number on (the amount of such advertising). But it's gone way 
up. . . . The biggest category is automotive," said Marcy Magiera, a reporter 
for Advertising Age. 
</P>
<P>
Some movie executives have complained privately that the ads alienate 
audiences. But none has so far been willing to take a step similar to Disney's 
-- and risk seeing its films kept off some screens by exhibitors who want to 
continue advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Distribution executives from 20th Century Fox Film Corp. and Paramount Pictures 
didn't return calls seeking comment. Fred Mount, Universal Pictures' 
distribution head, said he wasn't aware of any company that planned to follow 
Disney's move immediately. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles exhibitor, who declined to be identified, said he believed that 
Disney could enforce the policy without much difficulty, particularly if a 
second major distributor followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the choice between a Chevy ad and a Disney movie, you're going to take 
the Disney movie," the exhibitor said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney angered some theater owners a year ago by going to a so-called 
per-capita system, under which it takes a fixed dollar amount for each ticket 
sold rather than a percentage of the box-office take. The system tends to 
discourage the sale of discount tickets in first-run movie houses but didn't 
apply to discount theaters that normally show a film after its first run is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount followed with a per-capita system that applies to discount theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to lose theaters," Disney's Cook insisted Thursday in 
discussing the new advertising policy. "We're trying to preserve the 
movie-going experience. Attendance has been almost level for 10 years, and this 
industry can ill afford any erosion." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Disney would ask theater owners with existing advertising contracts 
to make a "good faith" effort to have Disney films exempted from the 
agreements. But he said Disney would allow exhibitors to honor those contracts 
if no exemption could be obtained and would only expect compliance with the 
studio's no-advertising rule on renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Disney has said it will make exceptions for slide advertisements shown during 
intermission and for "approved" charitable ads. Asked whether advertising by 
The Times and other newspapers, such as the L.A. Weekly, would be included, 
Cook said: "It is. That is an advertisement. We're not splitting fine hairs 
here." 
</P>
<P>
A Times spokeswoman said: "Our arrangement is with the theater owners. We 
haven't been contacted by them, so there's not much to say." 
</P>
<P>
One individual familiar with the paper's ad agreements with exhibitors said the 
"economic burden (on theater owners) is going to be enormous" if they are 
forced to pay the paper's normal ad rates when advertising Disney films. 
</P>
<P>
Still, several exhibitors contacted at ShoWest said they favored the Disney 
policy. "Even if it costs us money, I'm for it," said Bruce Corwin, head of 
Metropolitan Theatres, a major Southern California chain. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin said he briefly experimented with advertising but dropped it from many 
of his theaters because of an audience backlash. "The response was so loud and 
so negative, it was clearly not appropriate for us. You have to go with the 
culture, and the culture said no commercials," Corwin said. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan continues to show ads in its Spanish-language theaters, because 
audiences in those theaters didn't object, Corwin added.

PFIZER LOWERS PRICE OF AIDS DRUG, WILL PROVIDE SOME FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Pfizer Inc., hoping to grab market share and skirt the controversy over the 
pricing of AIDS drugs that has dogged other companies, said Thursday that it 
will donate 6,000 bottles of its new antifungal agent fluconazole to AIDS and 
cancer treatment centers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer also announced that its price for the drug in the United States, where 
the drug received Food and Drug Administration approval last month, would be 
20% to 30% below the price in Europe. It will be available through normal 
distribution channels Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
New York's People With AIDS Health Group, which had been importing the drug 
from overseas for desperate patients, applauded Pfizer's gestures. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Derek Hodel, the group's director, said the $284 monthly price tag for a 
typical 200-milligram-a-day maintenance dose "is very expensive and will place 
the drug outside the reach of people without access to reimbursement programs." 
</P>
<P>
Company officials and spokesmen defended the price. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Jefferis, a senior vice president of the New York pharmaceutical 
concern, said it is rushing the donated drugs to 200 treatment centers this 
week "to ensure that patients in critical need will receive it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The drug, whose trade name is Diflucan, is approved to combat such AIDS 
complications as thrush, systemic candidiasis and cryptococcal meningitis. It 
can also be used in certain cancer and transplant patients who suffer from 
these conditions. 
</P>
<P>
For cryptococcal meningitis, the drug, which is usually taken in pill form, is 
expected to be a strong competitor to Bristol-Myers Squibb's amphotericin B. 
That drug, also known as Fungizone, must be administered intravenously and has 
side effects that can be so unpleasant that some people with AIDS derisively 
refer to it as "ampho-terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer, in a press release, said its drug offers economic benefits over 
amphotericin B because patients on the Pfizer product require fewer days in the 
hospital. Bristol-Myers Squibb wasn't immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The high prices of such AIDS drugs as Burroughs Wellcome's AZT and Lyphomed's 
pentamidine have sparked protests by AIDS activists and in congressional 
hearings. For the pharmaceutical industry, the scrutiny has raised the 
unwelcome specter of price controls. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, Pfizer is making an effort to placate the AIDS community," Hodel 
said.

CAROLINE HUNT'S SOURED INVESTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
WEALTH: ONE OF THE NATION'S RICHEST WOMEN HAS LOST A BUNDLE ON STOCK IN FIRST 
EXECUTIVE. NOW HER TRUST IS BIDDING FOR THE LOS ANGELES INSURANCE COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For much of her 66 years, Caroline Rose Hunt, one of the nation's wealthiest 
women, focused her attention on doing good works and raising five children. 
More often than not, she shunned the spotlight that was hers for the asking, 
merely by virtue of being one of the Hunt dynasty of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
It was only in the last decade, when she took an interest in the buying and 
promotion of luxury hotels -- including the Bel-Air Hotel in Los Angeles -- 
that her name began to appear not only in the society columns but also the 
business pages. 
</P>
<P>
Her name has again come to the fore recently with an offer by a unit of the 
Caroline Hunt Trust Estate to purchase controversial First Executive Corp., the 
Los Angeles-based life insurance concern best known for its huge junk bond 
holdings. The offer expired this week without a response from First Executive, 
but another offer is widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's stock plunged last month after the company announced that it 
would take a $515-million charge against earnings to account for the declining 
value of its junk bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said the bid by the Caroline Trust, as it is known, is an effort 
to bolster public confidence in the struggling company. (One condition of the 
offer was that First Executive's chairman, Fred Carr, would have to resign from 
the company.) Rosewood Financial Inc., one of five corporations within the 
trust, owns almost 10% of First Executive's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
While Caroline Hunt's name is on the trust, executives within Rosewood and 
outside analysts portray her role in setting investment strategy as almost 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not a part of making those decisions," said Charles Tusa, a senior vice 
president of Rosewood. 
</P>
<P>
Robert D. Zimmerman, who was in charge of the trust's hotel management branch 
for 10 years before leaving last year to form his own company, said, "She lets 
her companies run themselves with her people, including family members, in on 
the decision making." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Benteman of Wealth Monitors, a Kansas City, Mo., investment firm that 
tracks the portfolios of the nation's wealthiest people, said Hunt's style when 
it comes to the trust is to keep it at arm's distance. She is not even a member 
of the advisory board that runs it. Her presence is felt, though, by the fact 
that her children are involved in the trust's activities, particularly her 
oldest son, Stephen Sands. 
</P>
<P>
"She surrounds herself with good people," Benteman said. "They are the best 
that money can buy." 
</P>
<P>
But the trust may have "stubbed its toe" by investing so heavily in First 
Executive, Benteman said, and it now appeared to be trying to bail out the 
ailing company by making the purchase offer. (Rosewood originally invested 
about $103 million in First Executive stock, but at current prices the stake is 
worth only about $27.5 million.) 
</P>
<P>
On balance, though, it is difficult to argue with Caroline Hunt's policy of 
letting others manage her fortune, though the downturn in oil and Texas real 
estate is sure to have had a negative effect on the trust. 
</P>
<P>
She is regularly ranked as one of the wealthiest women in the nation. And while 
her brothers -- Nelson Bunker, William Herbert and Lamar -- retain only a 
fraction of what was one of the largest fortunes in the world before their 
adventures in attempting to corner the silver market a decade ago, Caroline 
Hunt remains a perennial entry on any list of America's richest people. Forbes 
magazine last year estimated her worth at $800 million, including the assets of 
the trust. 
</P>
<P>
The second daughter of famed wildcatter H. L. Hunt, she is known as the kind of 
woman who prunes her own trees, cooks her own dinner and enjoys finding a 
bargain when she is shopping for clothes. The author of a book of pumpkin 
recipes, she was once asked by the Dallas Morning News whom she most resembled. 
</P>
<P>
"People say Mary Martin. I say thank you," she replied. A graduate of Mary 
Baldwin College in Virginia, she married a Navy pilot, Lloyd Sands. While he 
was off in World War II, she worked first in her father's Dallas office, then 
as a sales clerk at the Neiman Marcus department store. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had five children before they divorced in 1973 and she married Buddy 
Schoellkopf, who came from a prominent Dallas family. They too were later 
divorced. 
</P>
<P>
The entry into the hotel business began in 1979, when her children bought a 
rundown mansion in Dallas and spent $20 million for a nine-story hotel building 
next to it. Today, the Mansion on Turtle Creek is considered one of Dallas' 
finest. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt had in the past left most of the dealings of the trust to others, but the 
hotel business seemed to attract her interest. The construction of the tony 
Remington Hotel in Houston, the purchase of the Bel-Air and the Hotel Hana-Maui 
in Hawaii followed over the next five years, as did the building of the 
Crescent Court Hotel near downtown Dallas. While the trust handled the 
purchases, Hunt lent her name to the projects as a representative of the trust. 
</P>
<P>
"Business activities and publicizing are two different things," said Tusa. 
"She's been a tremendous help in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the hotel investments of the trust have been pared back by more 
than half. Both the Bel-Air and the Hana-Maui hotels were sold last year for 
staggering profits, and the Remington was disposed of in 1985. There have been 
persistent rumors that the hotels were sold to give the trust a cash infusion 
because of losses in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the real estate market and oil, you have to put that together," 
said Zimmerman.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S.J. DIAMOND: ON-TIME LAW LIMITED IN ITS APPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As proposed legislation, California Senate Bill 101 got so much attention last 
year you'd think it cured cancer or unclogged courts. But it was much more 
humble: As of Jan. 1, utilities, cable companies and certain retailers must 
make deliveries or repair calls within four hours of a promised time or risk a 
small claims court judgment awarding their customer up to $500 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's impetus was the personal experience of state Sen. Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), who had sat in a new apartment waiting for furniture that didn't 
come. His experience was unusual only in that he didn't ask an employee to do 
his waiting for him, and that when he mutters, "there oughtta be a law," he can 
start making one. 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer's proposal -- originally applied to all retailers and allowing only a 
two-hour time period -- provoked a lot of discussion, more angry than 
technical. There were no statistics behind the bill (e.g., total wages lost 
annually statewide). It was all anecdotal material gleaned from "stacks of 
letters from constituents," Lockyer aide Patricia Wynne says. Lockyer's own 
favorite story involved a woman who waited 4 1/2 days for a cable TV serviceman 
after being promised each afternoon that he really would be there the next day. 
</P>
<P>
To these tales were added the unsolicited testimony of many Sacramento 
lobbyists, who appeared at hearings on the bill not to represent their 
employers, but to share their own experiences. "Everyone," says Wynne, "has at 
some point in their life been stuck waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the original bill were less anecdotal but no more analytic. The 
California Retailers Assn. in Sacramento said its members can already meet a 
four-hour time limit 96% to 98% of the time even though it hadn't actually 
surveyed them. Pacific Bell said, like other utilities, it was already 
well-regulated by the Public Utilities Commission and should be excluded 
(although there's no regulation covering the keeping of appointments, according 
to the PUC.) 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all three affected industries said that it's more often the 
consumer who doesn't show up and that aggrieved customers could simply take 
their business to another company. What's more, they argued, if they had to 
guarantee a time, they'd have to put on more personnel, and it would end up 
costing the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the new law is obviously to give consumers more than promises to 
rest on, but its applications seem very limited. Independent service people -- 
plumbers, electricians, painters -- aren't included at all. As for retailers, 
only the delivery of goods is affected, not services or repairs, and only if 
they have more than 25 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are allowed an out for delays "caused by unforeseen or unavoidable 
occurrences," if the company made a "diligent effort" to notify the consumer -- 
"conditions which may be difficult to prove or disprove," says Herschel Elkins, 
California assistant attorney general in charge of consumer protection. 
Furthermore, they could make things worse by "rushing through repairs to make 
their next appointment," Elkins says, or even refusing to make future 
appointments at all, saying they'll call when they can make it. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer's recourse under the law is also limited. He must take his case to 
small claims court, thereby losing more time yet, and can recover only for 
actual financial loss, including lost wages, up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently it's just not easy to regulate such mundane personal arrangements. 
Laws in other states that invite enforcement by government agencies may provide 
no swifter surer justice. Massachusetts, for example, broadly rules it unfair 
and deceptive to promise prompt delivery "where delivery is neither prompt nor 
expeditious," or to fail to deliver merchandise on the date set unless there 
were "circumstances beyond (one's) control." 
</P>
<P>
New York City, by contrast, has a narrow rule, covering only new, ready-made 
furniture and major appliances: If a delivery appointment isn't met and the 
consumer wasn't informed ahead of time in writing, he can cancel the order, get 
his money back and up to $100 in lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in New York, where the consumer affairs department wields the law 
"aggressively" because of the number of complaints (500-600 a year on furniture 
alone, most concerning non-delivery), only 60 consumers a year on average have 
collected money. And in Massachusetts, a consumer seeking damages for lost time 
still has to sue the business -- probably a rare occurrence given the 
relatively small amount of money involved, says Edgar Dworsky, spokesman for 
the state's executive office of consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Given a state or municipal law, an enforcing agency could take stronger action 
against an offending company, but only if multiple complaints indicate a 
pattern of practice. Even then, enforcement is a matter of priorities, and 
non-delivery of furniture is not a major crime. A legislature can "name a 
government agency to enforce a law," says Richard Elbrecht, head of legal 
services for California's consumer affairs department, "but unless they fund 
people to do it, it's not very effective. Better to let small claims court do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Even in small claims court, supposedly more Populist than higher courts, "most 
judges would not take it seriously without a statute," says Elkins. Nor, 
perhaps, would the general public. Such statutes have an "educative function," 
says Elbrecht, "with the practical effect of highlighting something -- that the 
consumer should treat this arrangement a little more seriously. It's a rallying 
cry to basic integrity in human relations." 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, the law, whatever its limits, "provides guidance to what are 
considered fair business practices," says Dworsky, "defining when enough is 
enough. Business will know that if they sidestep these rules, they may be 
subject to penalties, and it helps the consumer to argue if he can say, 'The 
law says . . . ' "

COPPOLA ORDERED TO PAY $4.8 MILLION ON '81 DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola, already in bankruptcy proceedings, was ordered 
Wednesday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to pay $4.8 million in interest 
on a long-disputed debt owed to Canadian financier Jack Singer. 
</P>
<P>
The court had earlier ordered Coppola to repay the original amount of the 
$3-million loan, which Singer had made to the filmmaker in 1981 to help finance 
a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chapman, an attorney for Singer, said he expects to ask the court for 
attorney's fees and litigation costs that could boost the total judgment to 
more than $8.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Coppola declined to comment on the ruling, and an attorney for 
the filmmaker didn't return calls. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola and one of his privately owned companies, Zoetrope Productions, last 
month filed in Santa Rosa, Calif., for protection from creditors under Chapter 
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to Chapman, the bankruptcy judge 
subsequently issued an order permitting the Los Angeles judge to proceed with 
the Singer case, which was filed in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, a Calgary-based real estate developer, had loaned Coppola $3 million to 
help finance "One From the Heart," a costly flop that Coppola directed while 
operating Hollywood General Studios in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood General filed for bankruptcy in 1983, and Singer later bought the 
property, which he currently operates as Hollywood Center Studio. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola is in Italy, filming "Godfather III" for Paramount Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said he expected the bankruptcy court to rule next month on whether 
Coppola, who has lost past appeals in the Los Angeles case, to pursue any 
further appeals.

Genentech Shareholders File Suit: Four Genentech Inc. shareholders have filed 
suit in Delaware Chancery Court to block the sale of a 60% stake in the firm to 
Roche Holding Co., according to Federal Filings Inc. The report said the 
holders contend that the sale of new shares to Roche would severely dilute the 
holdings of current holders. They also claim that the $2.1-billion deal is a 
change of control of the company, which obligates the Genentech board to 
conduct an auction. The South San Francisco-based biotechnology concern said it 
had not seen the suit.

PUC DIVISION URGES REJECTION OF EDISON, SDG&amp;E MERGER; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: THE UNIT SAID THE DEAL WOULD NOT GUARANTEE LOWER RATES AFTER 1993, 
WOULD INCREASE AIR-QUALITY WOES AND CAUSE ANTITRUST PROBLEMS.

<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission division that represents utility 
customers urged commissioners Thursday to reject Southern California Edison's 
proposed merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric because it would not produce 
long-term benefits for customers. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Thursday, the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates charged 
that, as structured, the merger would not guarantee lower rates for customers 
after 1993. The report also said the merger would worsen Southern California's 
air-quality problems and cause severe antitrust problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis shows that the benefits are smaller and less certain to 
materialize than the applicants have claimed," DRA Director Terry L. Murray 
said in the report issued Thursday in San Francisco. "DRA urges the commission 
to reject the merger unless the applicants amend their proposal to make it 
beneficial to California ratepayers." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC's five commissioners will use the report -- along with thousands of 
documents generated by the utilities and dozens of other interested parties -- 
when they make a final decision on whether to approve the merger and create the 
nation's largest utility, with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the PUC will gather public comments on the merger in public hearings 
throughout Southern California. The PUC hopes to complete its review late this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Merger opponents on Thursday described the DRA report as one more important 
barrier that stands between the utilities and a completed merger. 
</P>
<P>
"This report, coupled with (state Atty. Gen. John K.) Van de Kamp's decision to 
oppose the merger, constitutes a one-two knockout punch," said Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San Diego-based 
consumer group that is opposing the merger that Edison proposed in 1988. "We'll 
never see this merger occur." 
</P>
<P>
The utilities were "basically encouraged by the tone of the DRA report," Edison 
spokesman Louis Phelps said Thursday. "They're basically saying that they have 
concerns, and we're saying that we think we can resolve those concerns." Phelps 
maintained that the merger would produce $1.7 billion in savings that would be 
passed along to customers in the form of lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly willing to open the door and talk with DRA," Bill Reed, 
SDG&amp;E's regulatory affairs manager, said Thursday. "I think, bottom line, 
that they have confirmed that there's a substantial level of benefits for our 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), who last year suggested that the 
state needed to toughen up regulations governing utility mergers, said Thursday 
that he is "not convinced that the guarantees for rate reductions were there. 
Without guarantees, they probably shouldn't be doing the merger." 
</P>
<P>
The PUC staff based its report on an "independent forecast" that tracked the 
utilities' claim that a merger would produce significant savings for utility 
customers by reducing operating, labor and fuel costs. The DRA forecast 
suggested that customers would be better off if the merger did not occur 
because a combination could "result in slightly higher rates in the long-run." 
</P>
<P>
The DRA report also noted that while Edison and SDG&amp;E had guaranteed rate 
savings through 1993, "there is no mechanism to ensure that ratepayers will 
receive one cent of the savings after 1993." Edison and SDG&amp;E have 
maintained that the bulk of the merger's savings would accrue in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
On the complex question of antitrust issues, the DRA noted that the merger 
would bolster Edison's ability to buy bulk power from other utilities but 
create long-term problems for a handful of small, municipally owned utilities 
in Southern California that import electrical power through Edison's already 
impressive transmission grid. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on what we know so far about DRA's position on anti-competitive issues 
and access to the transmission system of the merged utilities . . . we believe 
these issues can be resolved," Edison's Phelps said. 
</P>
<P>
Larry O'Donnell, a businessman who formed a San Diego-based group that supports 
the proposed utility merger, described most of the DRA's conditions as 
"bridgeable." O'Donnell also cautioned that the DRA report is not the PUC's 
final word on the complex merger. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing to remember is that the DRA often stakes out a strong 
position which the commissioners often toss out," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Deputy City Atty. William Shaffran, who has long represented the city 
in utility matters, doubted that Thursday's seemingly negative report would 
dissuade Edison and SDG&amp;E from seeking to complete the merger.

PEOPLE: WINTERS IS NEW CHAIRMAN, CEO AT EVANS/LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Evans/Los Angeles is one of the oldest advertising agencies in Los 
Angeles -- with roots going back to 1928 -- it is hardly a household name. And 
it continues struggling to compile a decent client rooster. 
</P>
<P>
In a move to pick up new business and improve its creative product, the agency 
said, it has hired a new chief executive and chairman of its Los Angeles 
office: Jim Winters, 50, executive vice president and creative director of the 
San Diego firm Franklin &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The man who recruited him for the job, Tom Weinberg, 49, will remain president 
and chief operating officer of Evans/Los Angeles. Weinberg had been chief 
executive of the firm until he stepped down from that post six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a good nucleus at Evans," Winters said, "but it has not been a very 
dynamic agency." His job, he said, is to boost agency morale, improve the 
quality of its ads and attract new business to the Los Angeles office of Salt 
Lake City-based Evans Communications. "We can't succeed in getting new business 
until we're more successful with the clients we have," Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the agency lost client Kwikset Corp., a maker of residential 
locks, and several months ago it resigned the Hamburger Hamlet account less 
than a year after winning it. At Franklin &amp; Associates, Winters helped 
develop creative strategy for the current ad campaign for the San Diego Zoo. 
Among its most familiar print ads is one with pictures of the Zoo's new Tiger 
River exhibit under the headline, "An amazing thing happens when you put 
animals in a natural setting. They act natural." 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Winters was president and chief executive of Winters Franceschi 
&amp; Callahan, an agency he co-founded in Phoenix. The agency went out of 
business in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Weinberg, who will now take on more administrative duties, insisted 
that he plans to remain at the agency. "I felt we needed to do something to 
drive the agency ahead," he said. "We haven't been winning as much business as 
we feel we should." BRUCE HOROVITZ

1 MILLION APPAREL JOBS AT RISK -- REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than one million apparel and textile workers -- mainly women, minorities 
and immigrants -- will lose their jobs if government officials fail to reverse 
policies that are sabotaging the industries, a new report from the liberal 
Economic Policy Institute contends. 
</P>
<P>
The industries -- taken together, the second-largest manufacturing employer in 
Los Angeles County and one of the biggest nationally -- could be virtually 
wiped out in this country by 2000 if current trends continue, according to the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Rothstein, a Los Angeles research consultant who wrote the Economic 
Policy Institute study, said in an interview Thursday that the heaviest toll 
would be taken on "a part of the labor force for which there are no better 
alternatives." He said dislocated apparel and textile workers "can't easily be 
moved" into other types of jobs, largely because of their lack of job skills. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the industry's decline, the study calls for a variety of government 
initiatives, revisions in existing economic policies and tighter enforcement of 
import quotas. The study's sponsor, the Washington-based Economic Policy 
Institute, is a research group backed by organized labor and other interests. 
</P>
<P>
Some other analysts characterized the report as off-target or overblown. Edward 
Hudgins, deputy director of economic policy studies for the conservative 
Heritage Foundation, criticized it for relying on quotas, which he contends 
have backfired in the past for the textile and steel industries. 
</P>
<P>
Hudgins argued that quotas "keep inefficient workers and industries going in 
this country" and translate into higher prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a world flooded with cheap underwear, who cares if we make it or 
not?" Hudgins said. Hudgins quickly added that the U.S. apparel and textile 
industries should remain a significant factor, albeit a smaller one, in the 
economy for years to come because of improved technologies that will partly 
offset overseas competitors' cheaper labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Preistland, chief economist for the American Apparel Manufacturers Assn., 
said he agreed that the nation's apparel industry -- whose employment fell from 
1.26 million in 1980 to 1.09 million last year -- would continue to decline 
because of increased imports. He added, however, that even without government 
initiatives, many American women's apparel makers could continue to thrive by 
offering such advantages as quicker deliveries than foreign firms provide. 
</P>
<P>
The Economic Policy Institute's study argued that U.S. apparel and textile 
makers could exploit those advantages -- which it said also include greater 
labor productivity, proximity to designers and retailers, and manufacturing 
flexibility -- to maintain its strength. The report contended, however, that 
government officials have mistakenly conceded that the collapse of the 
industries is inevitable due to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the foreign firms' gains have come largely because of 
flawed U.S. policies. It cited foreign debt policies that have put pressure on 
Mexican workers' wages, thereby undercutting U.S. competitors with higher labor 
costs. The study also contended that apparel makers in the Caribbean can get 
more U.S. aid than domestic firms, in the form of engineering help, training 
programs and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
A continued decline in apparel and textiles, the study said, would ripple 
through many allied industries and lead to big increases in government spending 
on welfare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
To support the apparel and textile industries, the institute called for pushing 
for improved international labor standards that would raise foreign workers' 
wages. It also endorsed government programs that would promote cooperatives 
enabling small apparel contractors and subcontractors to pool their efforts and 
measures to bring together domestic buyers and sellers of apparel products. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it called on the government to encourage apparel exports and 
provide more credit to contractors' to help them cut their interest expenses. 
</P>
<P>
According to government figures, Los Angeles County last month had 87,900 jobs 
in apparel manufacturing and 12,100 in textile production.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: HIGH-TECH STOCKS REDISCOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just in time for Valentine's Day, investors' love-hate relationship with 
high-tech stocks is back in the I-can't-get-enough-of-you mode. 
</P>
<P>
While the broad market was plunging in January, many high-tech stocks were 
inching higher. And over the past two weeks, some of the tech stocks have 
turned red hot. Year-to-date, many are up 20% or more. And some smart money is 
betting we're just at the start of a major surge. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers have focused not so much on the giants of the computer business but 
on many of the smaller companies -- especially those that make specialized 
computer equipment, such as workstations, and those that supply key computer 
parts, such as disk drives. Some of the big gainers include Seagate Technology, 
Conner Peripherals and Sun Microsystems -- all California-based. 
</P>
<P>
What's happened in recent weeks, analysts say, is the realization by Wall 
Street that while the computer business is slowing with the economy, it isn't 
collapsing -- at least not for personal computers and other desktop equipment. 
Inventories appear to be under control, and many tech firms are far stronger 
financially than a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, at the first signs of weakness in the business, many investors 
assumed the worst and tech stocks were murdered. "Particularly in the personal 
computer business, there was so much negative stuff," says analyst Steven Ossad 
at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "Now, there's an acceptance that 
while (PC sales) annual growth isn't 25% to 35%, it's still in the 15%-plus 
category worldwide. And that's still pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
If investors overreacted last year, their nervousness was understandable. Many 
high-tech stocks rode a roller coaster in the 1980s as boom-bust cycles 
repeated. Plenty of companies alive at the start of the '80s don't exist now. 
Value Line Investment Survey notes that, of 24 computer equipment makers it 
followed at the start of the '80s, 11 no longer are in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, tech stocks are in some ways Wall Street's favorite horror story. But 
as in many horror stories, tech stocks left for dead often return as monster 
performers just as most investors turn their backs on the group. 
</P>
<P>
That's the case once again. The renewed interest in the stocks is partly 
attributable to a show-and-tell conference on tech stocks that Goldman, Sachs 
&amp; Co. hosted in New York this week. Analysts say that while little new 
information came out of the conference, big investors woke up to the reality 
that tech stocks are depressed, compared to the companies' healthy earnings 
prospects for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Seagate, which makes minicomputer and PC hard disk drives -- the devices that 
enable data to be stored and retrieved by a computer -- is a good example of 
what analysts consider an undervalued stock. It is expected to earn about $2 a 
share in the year ending June 30. So at $18.25 on Thursday, the stock is 
selling for just nine times earnings. In contrast, the average stock, as 
measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, sells for about 13 times 
estimated 1990 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst John Rossi of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in San Francisco thinks that 
shares of Seagate and several other disk drive makers, including Maxtor Corp., 
still have much further to rise. His optimism stems partly from the 
consolidation of the industry in the 1980s: As competitors have fallen away -- 
including the most recent casualty, MiniScribe Corp., last year -- the 
survivors are in better shape to make good money off the demand expected for 
more powerful computers in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi's main fear is that the Japanese will somehow figure out how to grab 
control of the hard disk drive market. Still, he notes, despite their efforts 
to make inroads in the 1980s, Japanese drive makers were able to raise their 
U.S. market share to just 15% by last year, from 5% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Among tech-stock fans, some picks now include: 
</P>
<P>
* Conner Peripherals. Also a disk drive maker, Conner is a major supplier to 
Compaq Computer and is "talking with a lot of other companies about the right 
kind of products" for the '90s, Ossad says. He estimates that Conner will earn 
$1.55 a share this year. At $15.25 on Thursday, that gives the stock a 
price/earnings ratio (P/E) of just under 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Autodesk. This firm makes software for computer-aided design and drafting. 
Richard Frucci, manager of the $100-million Putnam Information Sciences Trust 
mutual fund in Boston, doubled his holdings in Autodesk in January. He says the 
company has a "unique position selling their type of software for the desktop 
computer" market, which continues to boom. As earnings have soared since 1985 
($2.70 a share is estimated for 1990), the stock has risen to $44 from $4. 
</P>
<P>
For Technophobes, a Better Way: If the tech stock rally piques your interest, 
but you're terrified of ending up with a bankrupt, there's a way to lower your 
risk: Use mutual funds that specialize in tech stocks. There are 24 such funds, 
according to Lipper Analytical Services. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 months (through last week), the average tech-stock fund gained 
just 8.4%, compared to 9.6% for general stock funds, Lipper says. The tech 
group under-performed because investors shunned the stocks for much of last 
year. But if the group is indeed being rediscovered in 1990, the tech funds' 
performance should reflect that. And the funds lower your risk of being hurt by 
any one stock disaster, because they buy a diversified portfolio of issues. 
That also means you can't make the kind of money you could by getting lucky on 
a single stock. But in the volatile world of high-tech, one-company bets are 
strictly for investors with money to burn. 
</P>
<P>
Too Many Bears? Market pros are more bearish than at any time since June, 1982, 
the latest weekly survey by Investors Intelligence of Larchmont, N.Y., shows. 
And that has contrarians -- who believe the majority is always wrong -- 
wondering if stocks are ready to soar anew. 
</P>
<P>
The Investors Intelligence survey of 130 market analysts shows 57.3% now 
bearish. The last time it was higher was in June, 1982, at 57.6% -- just before 
the bull market began in August, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
But the survey's overseer, Michael Burke, admits that even if the majority is 
wrong again, it could be months before the market turns, and it could go lower 
in the interim. The high reading for bearishness was 60.9% in March, 1982 -- a 
full five months before the bear market ended. 
</P>

HIGH TECH IS HOT AGAIN

Opposition to Federated Department Store Inc.'s financing proposal collapsed 
Thursday night, clearing the way for a federal bankruptcy judge to allow the 
retailer to obtain a $400-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said he would review a proposed compromise between 
Federated and a committee representing unsecured creditors, who are mainly 
merchandise suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would see no impediment to my signing the order tomorrow morning," Aug said, 
which would allow Federated to draw on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The loan from a 90-bank syndicate headed by Citibank of New York would be in 
addition to a $1-billion financing package allowing Federated to sell credit 
card receipts to a subsidiary, Federated Credit Corp. The credit division 
wasn't among those that filed Jan. 15 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

FCC SLAPS RECORD $1.4-MILLION FINE ON NYNEX UNITS

The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday fined New York Telephone Co. 
and New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. a record $1.4 million for alleged 
improper dealings with an affiliated company and ordered them to refund about 
$35 million to customers. 
</P>
<P>
The fine against the two units of NYNEX Corp. was the maximum allowed under law 
and involved an alleged $118.5 million in overcharges made to New York 
Telephone and New England Telephone by Material Enterprises Co., an unregulated 
NYNEX affiliate that provides equipment and services to the two phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The action -- the largest federal penalty imposed on a telephone company -- was 
seen as a warning to the nation's regional Bell companies that the FCC is 
committed to regulating the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that the FCC cannot effectively regulate the giant phone firms, 
particularly if Congress bows to their requests that they be freed from federal 
rules barring them from the manufacturing, information services and 
long-distance businesses. 
</P>
<P>
FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the FCC's action demonstrates the commission's 
"capability and commitment to regulate even the largest" telephone companies.

FIRST EXECUTIVE LETS ROSEWOOD BID EXPIRE; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: THE LOS ANGELES FIRM'S SILENCE ON THE OFFER ANGERS MAJOR 
SHAREHOLDERS. ANOTHER BID IS EXPECTED SOON.

<P>
A conditional offer by Rosewood Financial to acquire the big Los Angeles-based 
life insurance holding company First Executive Corp. expired this week without 
any response from First Executive's board. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a response angered Rosewood officials as well as other major First 
Executive shareholders. Dallas-based Rosewood Financial, part of Rosewood 
Corp., the holding company for the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, is holding talks 
with its financial advisers and is widely expected to come forward soon with 
another firmer offer. 
</P>
<P>
Mark W. Hobbs, Rosewood Financial's president, confirmed that he planned to 
meet with advisers Thursday and today. An outside spokesman for Rosewood said: 
"We're looking at our options. I would hope we'd be back fairly soon with 
something." But neither Hobbs nor the spokesman would comment on what the next 
move may be. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood has said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that 
it had hired Chase Manhattan Bank to serve as financial adviser in connection 
with its offer. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Carr, chairman and chief executive of First Executive, confirmed in a 
telephone interview that "the board has not responded" to the Rosewood offer. 
But he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Rosewood, First Executive's second-largest shareholder, controls 9.95% of the 
company's stock. Its offer, made Jan. 26, was prompted by the collapse of First 
Executive's stock price since the company announced that it would report a net 
loss for 1989 because of heavy losses from its $8-billion investment in junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's stock tumbled to around $3 a share in the over-the-counter 
market after the company announced last month that it would take a $515-million 
charge against 1989 fourth-quarter earnings because of the drop in value of its 
portfolio of high-yield, high-risk bonds. The stock had been trading at more 
than $9 a share in late December, down from a high of more than $17 a share 
earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, which expired Wednesday, would have provided First Executive 
shareholders with $6 a share, or one share of stock in the post-merger company 
for each share of First Executive common. A main condition of the offer, 
however, was that Carr resign from the company and the board. 
</P>
<P>
Hobbs said he was angered that First Executive hadn't responded to the offer. 
"There are just certain common courtesies you give people, one of which is a 
response, even if its just 'go away,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Reed, a former U.S. undersecretary of Commerce who is also a major 
shareholder of First Executive, was even more blunt about the lack of a reply. 
Reed, long a dissident, said: "This management is totally non-responsive to 
shareholders." He said the lack of a response is an example of Carr and the 
other directors "not giving a damn about the shareholders who own the company 
and ignoring their needs." Reed said he recently lowered his stake in First 
executive to about 2.5% from 4%. 
</P>
<P>
After it was disclosed Thursday that the Rosewood offer had expired without a 
response, First Executive's stock closed at $3.25 a share, off 25 cents, in 
active trading of more than 1.2 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive recently released its largest shareholder, ICH Corp., from a 
standstill agreement, allowing that company to attempt to put together an 
all-cash offer for First Executive by July. It wasn't clear, however, whether 
ICH was making progress toward an offer. Steven B. Bing, an executive who acts 
as spokesman for the company, failed to return a call to his office Thursday. 
ICH, a Louisville, Ky., insurance holding company, controls just over 20% of 
First Executive's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's board members are understood to have discussed the Rosewood 
offer informally but not taken any action. A regularly scheduled board meeting 
is to take place Monday, but Carr declined to comment on whether any statement 
may be made about the expired offer.

TRAFFIC: TOUGH NEW STANDARDS MIGHT HAVE SLOWED CONSTRUCTION IN THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The folks over at the local builders' trade group and the Irvine Co. are 
breathing a little easier since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That's when months of intense lobbying in Sacramento got them a compromise on 
some tough new traffic standards that might have slowed construction in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, these standards might be called "Son of Measure A," the slow-growth 
measure that the real estate industry spent millions of dollars persuading the 
county's voters to kill two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new ones are attached to a state measure that would gradually increase the 
gas tax by 9 cents a gallon if the state's voters approve it in June. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, builders like anything that will get more roads built; new roads 
enhance the value of their land and ease the increased traffic their 
subdivisions, offices and shopping centers generate. 
</P>
<P>
And this tax would raise more than $18 billion over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But to get it, cities and counties must also swallow stringent new standards on 
traffic congestion. If they don't start making a dent in the traffic jams, they 
don't get all the new tax money they would be entitled to. Why hand out money, 
said supporters, if the cities don't use it to clean up their own messes? 
</P>
<P>
When the builders' trade association discovered that the tough traffic 
requirements had been slipped quietly into the tax package passed by the 
Legislature, they were dismayed. Their argument went like this: The traffic 
standards are impossible to meet in traffic-choked urban areas such as Orange 
County. So the places that need the money most might not get much of it, while 
rural counties where traffic is light would rake it in. 
</P>
<P>
The lobbying paid off. Meeting on Monday with the author of the standards, 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), the lobbyists got Katz to increase their 
options. 
</P>
<P>
If, for instance, a city can't hold down traffic congestion at an intersection, 
it will be allowed to do something to improve air quality instead. 
</P>
<P>
That kept the environmental groups that attended Monday's lengthy meeting 
happy. They had threatened to oppose the tax increase too if the traffic 
standards were softened. That might have shot the whole thing down because a 
single powerful interest group could sink the measure, political experts say, 
so iffy is its prospect of passage by the voters in June. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmentalists felt we left the traffic plan intact and the developers 
felt the whole thing was a little more workable," Katz said Thursday. "I still 
believe the old standards would work, and I still think that the people who 
caused the trouble with this were acting out of greed." 
</P>
<P>
The builders are studying the new requirements Katz proposed. They could come 
out with a statement shortly in favor of the tax increase, said members of the 
Building Industry Assn., the home builders' powerful trade group. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem about to reach a fair agreement," said Owen R. Waters, a senior staff 
vice president in charge of BIA's lobbying in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The new requirements are also being studied carefully at the trade 
association's Orange County chapter in Santa Ana. So far, they look agreeable, 
said Executive Director Christine Diemer Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Irvine Co., the county's largest landowner with more than 
60,000 acres, are still reading the new requirements too. The company also 
lobbied hard against the traffic measure, including trying to get some toll 
highways it is helping to build exempted from the regulations, according to 
Katz. 
</P>
<P>
The company says that's not so -- that it was only trying to make sure it 
wouldn't get penalized for helping alleviate the county's traffic mess. 
</P>
<P>
If, for instance, one of the off-ramps on the new toll highways dumped a lot of 
traffic onto a city street, the Irvine Co. says traffic would get worse at the 
intersection and the city would get less gas tax revenues, even though the toll 
highway improved traffic flow overall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, under the new regulations, if traffic flow gets worse at crowded 
intersections and there is not much that can be done, a city won't necessarily 
lose the money, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
It can require developers in the area to either widen a road or build a traffic 
signal elsewhere in the city, or make an improvement in air quality. 
</P>
<P>
That's if the measure passes. Some political experts are skeptical, saying a 
9-cent increase is too much for voters to swallow. Even a mere half-cent 
increase in the sales tax went down in flames last year in Orange County, which 
is notorious for the anti-tax sentiments of its voters. 
</P>
<P>
But the money from the gas tax, Katz said, is critical. The state, he said, 
needs $3.5 billion more than it has for a modest five-year road program.

MAZDA TO SELL FORD-BUILT EXPLORERS IN BID TO ENTER FUN-TRUCK MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
In a bid to capture a piece of the growing market for so-called fun trucks, 
Mazda Motor of America said Thursday that it will begin selling its version of 
Ford Motor Co.'s new Explorer sport-utility vehicle this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda's announcement marked the first time a Japanese auto maker will buy an 
American manufacturer's vehicles and then sell them under its name in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, U.S. car makers buy Japanese- or Korean-built cars for sale under 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
The deal underscored the global melding by auto makers as they forge 
partnerships to cut costs and remain competitive into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It also marked another association between Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. The two 
have been financial partners since 1979 when Ford bought 25% of Mazda. The two 
recently began collaboration on new vehicles. Mazda produces the chassis shared 
by the Mazda MX-6 and the Ford Probe and builds the Probe for Ford at its plant 
in Flat Rock, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's all-new Escort and Tracer subcompact cars, which will debut later this 
year, are heavily based on Mazda subcompacts already on sale. 
</P>
<P>
The new Mazda sports utility vehicle, to be called the Navajo, was shown 
Thursday at a preview for the Chicago Auto Show that starts a nine-day run 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The truck essentially is the same vehicle as the Ford Explorer that will go on 
sale this spring as a 1991 model to replace the Ford Bronco II. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Aikins, a spokesman for Mazda Motor of America, the auto maker's 
Irvine-based U.S. marketing and distribution company, said the Navajo's front 
end and interior will be different from the Explorer's, however. 
</P>
<P>
Aikins said the Navajo will sell in the $13,000-$18,000 price range -- about 
the same as Mazda's wildly successful two-seat convertible, the Miata. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company expects Navajo sales to hit only 15,000 to 18,000 units a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda decided to use a Ford-designed and built sports utility vehicle rather 
than developing its own, Aikins said, "because developing any kind of vehicle 
was quite expensive and Ford had a vehicle that was ready. We've been looking 
into a sport utility truck design for several years now." 
</P>
<P>
Auto industry analysts say that the fun-truck market for Jeep-like sports 
utility trucks and for small pickup trucks is about the only one that is doing 
well in the current depressed auto market. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles often are priced less than comparably equipped sedans and have a 
definite identity in a market that increasingly is offering consumers 
look-alike vehicles, said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, an 
advertising research firm in Los Angeles that specializes in automobile 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda is in particular need of a new truck model because its truck sales have 
been falling since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
One potential problem Mazda faces with the Navajo, several analysts said, is 
that it will market only a two-door version, while the Ford Explorer will come 
in both two-door and four-door models. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Japanese auto makers, both headquartered in Orange County, already 
sell two-door sports-utility vehicles in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Daihatsu America, headquartered in Los Alamitos, markets the Rocky, while 
American Suzuki Motor Corp. of Brea sells the Samurai and Sidekick models. 
</P>
<P>
The market for four-door sports utility vehicles is generally considered to be 
the healthiest. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and General Motors are introducing four-door trucks to compete with 
Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee and with import models like the Toyota 4Runner. 
</P>
<P>
But selling the Navajo allows Mazda to sidestep the 25% import tariff imposed 
on two-door trucks while putting the auto maker into a new market segment. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be a full-line marketer," said Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda 
Motor of America.

SOME SURPRISES IN WGA NOMINEES, SHUTOUTS; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: 'BAKER BOYS,' 'MY LEFT FOOT' ARE DARK-HORSE NOMINEES FOR WRITERS GUILD 
AWARDS; NON-UNION 'DO THE RIGHT THING,' 'DRUGSTORE COWBOY' WERE DISQUALIFIED.

The screenplays for "The Fabulous Baker Boys" and the independent Irish film 
"My Left Foot" were the only surprise nominees among the 10 announced Thursday 
for the 1989 Writers Guild of America awards. 
</P>
<P>
But there were surprises among those shut out from the list: Both "Do the Right 
Thing," Spike Lee's steamy look at the roots of an urban race riot, and 
"Drugstore Cowboy," a Bonnie-and-Clyde tale of a group of drug-addicted 
bandits, co-written by Dan Yost and director Gus Van Sant, were eliminated from 
the race because they were not union pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kloves, who wrote and directed "The Fabulous Baker Boys," was joined on 
the list of nominees for best original screenplay by Woody Allen ("Crimes and 
Misdemeanors"), Tom Schulman ("Dead Poets Society"), Steven Soderbergh ("sex, 
lies, and videotape") and Nora Ephron ("When Harry Met Sally"). 
</P>
<P>
Shane Connaughton and Jim Sheridan, co-authors of "My Left Foot," were 
nominated for best adapted screenplays along with Phil Alden Robinson, who 
adapted "Field of Dreams" from W. T. Kinsella's novel "Shoeless Joe"; Oliver 
Stone and Ron Kovic, who adapted "Born on the Fourth of July" from Kovic's 
autobiography; Alfred Uhry, who adapted "Driving Miss Daisy" from his own play, 
and Kevin Jarre, who adapted "Glory" from a pair of books on the Civil War, as 
well as Robert Gould Shaw's letters. 
</P>
<P>
"My Left Foot" was adapted by Connaughton and Sheridan, who also directed the 
film, from the autobiography of the severely disabled Irish painter Christy 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an extraordinarily rich year for screenplays," said director/writer 
Ron Shelton, who won the guild's award last year for his original "Bull Durham" 
script. Shelton, who announced the nominees at the guild Thursday morning, 
added that he had had a tough time whittling his own choices down to 10. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the first time that critically acclaimed films were left out of 
the WGA competition because the companies that produced them were not guild 
signatories. "The Dead" and "Crossing Delancey" were shut out for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
"So, let that be a lesson (to non-union productions)," said WGA President 
George Kirgo. Although "Do the Right Thing" was released by Universal Pictures, 
which is obligated to make only union films, it was produced independently and 
picked up for distribution by the studio. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual round of nominations last week, the Directors Guild of America 
also overlooked Lee, who wrote, directed and starred in the controversial and 
critically acclaimed "Do the Right Thing." 
</P>
<P>
However, both "Do the Right Thing" and "Drugstore Cowboy" were eligible for 
that race because the directors guild does not have a prohibition against 
nominating directors from non-union movies. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugstore Cowboy" had been selected as best picture of the year by the 
National Society of Film Critics. The Los Angeles film critics tapped "Do the 
Right Thing" as the year's best film. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Mazursky, who co-wrote "Enemies, A Love Story," adapted from Isaac 
Bashevis Singer's novel about four Holocaust survivors in post-war New York, 
was also shut out on both DGA and WGA ballots. 
</P>
<P>
But in a year where few groups have been able to agree on candidates for best 
achievements, the WGA nominations covered those made by their colleagues in the 
Directors Guild. The screenplays for the films of all five DGA nominees -- 
Woody Allen, Peter Weir, Oliver Stone, Phil Alden Robinson and Rob Reiner -- 
were nominated by the WGA. And three of the DGA nominees -- Allen, Stone and 
Robinson -- personally received nominations from both groups.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: 'CHOCOLATE' GOES TOO SOON FOR YOUNG 
S.D. AUDIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Teri Solomon Mitze doesn't like it when people refer to young audiences as the 
audiences of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I see them as audiences of the present," said the founder and producer of the 
Milwaukee-based Great American Children's Theatre Company. "They are our 
audience. They are sitting in our seats now." 
</P>
<P>
And they are filling up those seats in Symphony Hall, where "Charlie and the 
Chocolate Factory," opened Wednesday and will end its sold-out run today at 
9:45 and 11:45 a.m. The story of the little boy who wins a tour of Willy 
Wonka's chocolate factory travels to Los Angeles Feb. 12-15 at the Pantages 
Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen youthful critics caught outside Symphony Hall were uniformly 
enthusiastic about the hour-long show they had just seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so awesome," said John Franklin, a 7-year-old student at Rincon 
Elementary in Escondido. "I loved it. I want to see it again." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it too," said his classmate, 7-year-old Byron Perry. "I want to marry 
it." 
</P>
<P>
It has been a successful tour for Mitze, who sold out the San Diego tickets in 
October, just a week after she announced the tour. She sells out in most 
cities, she said. In fact, if you can't catch the show here, the only place you 
might have luck is in Kansas City, Mo., the one place where she has yet to sell 
more than half of a house. 
</P>
<P>
Mitze had no answer for why San Diego doesn't have a professional children's 
theater company other than the emerging Del Mar Theatre Ensemble, which is now 
seeking to fill that vacuum. (The Del Mar Theatre Ensemble's next show is 
"Telling Wilde Tales," a series of Oscar Wilde fairy tales that it will present 
March 3-April 8 at the Del Mar Plaza.) 
</P>
<P>
Nationally recognized children's theater companies exist in only about a dozen 
states, she said in a coffee shop across the street from Symphony Hall. And 
that marks a great increase from the handful that existed 15 years ago when she 
founded the company, which features adults. 
</P>
<P>
One could imagine a natural partnership between adult theaters and children's 
theaters such as the one that exists with Theatreworks USA in New York, which 
presented "The Secret Garden" during the day at the Promenade Theatre, the 
Off-Broadway venue that featured "The Cocktail Hour" sometimes less than an 
hour after Theatreworks USA dismantled its set. 
</P>
<P>
"The Secret Garden" journeys to the Mandeville Auditorium at UC San Diego April 
20. 
</P>
<P>
But such partnerships aren't simple, Mitze said. Many directors of adult 
theaters aren't interested, artistically, in children's programming. And 
financially, producing professional children's theater is as expensive as 
presenting any other kind of theater. The annual budget for her Equity company 
is $1.2 million. She depends on ticket sales for 95% of that budget and she 
sets ticket prices at a mere $1.75-$4.75 so that the shows will be accessible 
to all children. She has to play to large audiences to keep in the black, and 
she does; she has sold 16,000 tickets in San Diego alone and when she is home, 
works out of the 1,400-seat Pabst Theatre in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
She has had two major deficit battles that almost closed her theater over the 
years, one for about $40,000 and the other for about $70,000. One of her 
reasons for touring -- which she started doing last year -- was to amortize the 
cost of her shows. She is now seeking National Endowment for the Arts funding 
to provide a financial cushion. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep thinking that a grant of $100,000 would put us on easy street," she 
said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
While Mitze, 39, doesn't have children of her own, she has the highest respect 
for her audience, whose respect she very much wants to keep. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to be subtle for these children who have seen 'Star Wars' and 
every trick available. We have to show them honest performances. We get the 
kids who can't afford the ticket and the kids in wheelchairs and the kids from 
Beverly Hills, and they are all challenging us to show them a good time. And 
what I'm trying to do is give them an experience that gives them something to 
ponder." 
</P>
<P>
During her tour of Southern California Mitze has been doing some pondering of 
her own. She is considering starting a branch of the Great American Children's 
Theatre Company in Los Angeles and possibly in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Her more immediate plans, however, involve returning here next year, possibly 
with an adaptation of "The Wind in the Willows" that she commissioned, and 
staying for a week-long run. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Casting has been set for Mark Lee's "Rebel Armies Deep Into 
Chad," to be presented at Old Globe Theatre March 3-April 15: Richard Kneeland, 
Jim Phipps, Rose Weaver and Cheryl Francis Harrington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Bowery Theatre will present "Forecast," a futuristic parable by Elizabeth 
Wray beginning Feb. 20 at the Kingston Playhouse, along with the monologue 
"Coyotes," by San Diego State University professor Mack Owen. The double bill 
will run Tuesdays and Wednesdays for four weeks through March 14, concurrently 
with "Teibele and her Demon," which runs Thursdays-Sundays. Erin Kelly, who 
stars in "Teibele" will also star in "Coyotes." . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Oscar?," a new play by local playwright Mark Melden, opens at the 
Progressive Stage Company this week and continues through March 1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The world premiere of "Some of These Days," a story about the golden years of 
singer Sophie Tucker, has been selling out and has been extended through April 
7 at the 60-seat Little Fox Theater at La Casa Del Zorro desert resort. Written 
by Gayle Dunne-Davis and directed by D. Larry Steckling, the show runs at 8:30 
p.m. Fridays and 7 and 9:30 p.m. Saturdays. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Diversionary Theatre has a new space (the Golden Hill Center at 23rd Street and 
Broadway), a new show ("Untold Decades," opening Feb. 23) and a new number 
(232-2333). . . . 
</P>
<P>
You only need a few minutes to try out for "A Few Hours in Hell," a 
co-production of NeitherWorld Productions and the Progressive Stage Company, 
holding open auditions noon Saturday and Sunday at the Progressive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Terrence McNally, whose last work here was "Up in Saratoga" at the Old Globe, 
has written "Andre's Mother," a teleplay for American Playhouse about the 
mother and the lover a young AIDS victim leaves behind. The show airs on 
KPBS-TV on March 14 at 10:30 p.m. and repeats March 18 at 1 p.m.

AFI WRITERS WORKSHOP SEEKING MINORITY SCRIPTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Film Institute Alumni Assn. Writers Workshop is seeking script 
submissions from minority screenwriters in Los Angeles for its newly 
established Ethnic Minority Screenwriters Development Program. 
</P>
<P>
Five winners will be chosen to receive a $500 scholarship and a personal 
critique of their work from an industry expert. 
</P>

BLUE GROSBEAK 
</P>
<P>
(Guiraca caerulea Linnaeus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: The male Blue Grosbeak is deep blue and is similar to the Indigo 
Bunting, although it is larger, has wide chestnut wing bars and a heavy, large 
</P>
<P>
bill. Females are dull brown above and buffy below, with wing bars and large 
bills, similar to the male. 
</P>
<P>
Juveniles resemble the female. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Somewhat common, Blue Grosbeaks are found in low, overgrown fields, 
streamsides, along woodland edges and brushy road- sides. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Includes, snails, grain and, occasionally, fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: No display pattern is documented, although it has a habit of 
twitching and spreading its tail. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually built in low trees or vine tangles. It is made of twigs, small 
roots and inner bark strippings and lined with grass, dried leaves, paper, 
hair, vine tendrils and small roots. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Pale bluish white, unmarked. Slightly less than an inch long. 
</P>
<P>
Song: Song is a series of rich rising and falling warbles. Call is a loud, 
explosive "chink." 
</P>
<P>
Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 
962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society 
volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis. 
</P>

A bar, restaurant or store is not automatically authorized to sell alcohol, but 
instead must obtain a license from the state of California. The following lists 
the number of licenses currently issued for each city in Orange County, by the 
most to the fewest licenses per 1,000 residents. On-site refers to bars, 
restaurants and other places where alcohol can be consumed on the premises, 
while off-site is for grocery stores, liquor stores and other places where you 
can buy liquor but not consume it there.

SINGLE LIFE: SOME IDEAS FOR MELTING YOUR VALENTINE'S HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Once upon a time -- about AD 269 -- in a small village outside Rome, lived a 
man named Valentine who was imprisoned for refusing to worship on a lawfully 
appointed day. Children who were fond of Valentine tossed messages of love 
between the bars of his cell window. Later, his goodness recognized, he was 
sainted. 
</P>
<P>
Is this how St. Valentine's Day came to be? 
</P>
<P>
No one can prove it, but florists agree that Feb. 14 is their busiest day of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
And now, perhaps because of that sainted prisoner who received those first 
declarations of love, every woman in America feels slighted when a gift of 
candy or flowers -- or at the very least a card -- fails to arrive in 
mid-February. Thanks to Valentine, every absent-minded man will reap the 
discomfiting ire of The Forgotten Woman. 
</P>
<P>
If the relationship is new, he might think about sending a Valentine but then 
second-guess himself, thinking it presumptuous. 
</P>
<P>
This is a wrong assumption. 
</P>
<P>
Every woman loves being remembered on Valentine's Day -- whether she's crazy 
about you or not. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming you are fond of her, the next question is: how fond? Do you slip her a 
card, send flowers, or invest in jewelry? Be creative. Women have unique "buy 
me/surprise me" genes. Select one of these ideas and you are sure to score 
points with her. 
</P>
<P>
Escort her on a romantic flight over the city. Ron Tye, a Huntington Beach 
pilot and flight instructor who operates from the Long Beach Flying Club, will 
take you and your sweetheart for a champagne coastal flight over Orange County 
in a twin-engine airplane for $130 an hour. (714) 969-8864. 
</P>
<P>
Touch down to a surprise dinner for two catered by Tina Taitt, owner of A Taste 
of Class. A popular request is for Salmon Wellington, which she decribes as 
"fresh salmon filled with a stuffing made of artichoke bottoms, wrapped in 
pastry and baked. We top it with a Madiera sauce." Champagne rice pilaf is one 
of the side dishes she serves with the gourmet treat. Chocolate lovers may wish 
to crown the evening with her thick -- and very rich -- chocolate torte a deux. 
About $200. (714) 841-5662. 
</P>
<P>
Put a little magic into your evening, courtesy of Daryl. His specialty is 
improvisational hocus-pocus: "Give me a name and any date -- a birthday, an 
anniversary, the day you met -- and I'll design a special magic act for the two 
of you." The Anaheim-based sleight-of-hand artist, who has received a number of 
awards from the Magic Castle in Hollywood, can magically produce the ring if 
you're thinking about popping the question. The cost is $350 for a 30-minute 
show. (714) 533-7887. 
</P>
<P>
You may not be able to give her the moon, but you can give her the stars. For 
$110, Giovanna will forecast the year for individuals and couples. The 
Irvine-based licensed astrologer (one of only five licensed astrologers in 
Orange County) has 25 years of experience that she claims enables her to 
accurately predict trends. She insists that "knowing the right time to start 
projects or begin a life together as a couple is critical to its success." 
(714) 551-2514. 
</P>
<P>
Immortalize her. Charles F. Queenan, a former newspaper reporter and veteran 
free-lance writer, puts life stories on paper for posterity. Whether your life 
is epic or soap opera material, the author and historian will record it all and 
present a bound copy to you for about $40 per hour. (714) 979-4517. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers, imported Belgian chocolates, champagne and caviar may be what it takes 
to melt your lover's heart. If so, sisters Linda Sugino and Elaine Miyagishima, 
owners of Bell Tower Florist in El Toro, will deliver a gourmet basket designed 
especially for your sweetheart, complete with champagne glasses for $100 and 
up. (714) 768-6788. 
</P>
<P>
For those who think big, a larger-than-life balloon sculpture by Peggy Martin, 
owner of Impressions Party Design might be just the ticket. The El Toro-based 
artist and full-service party planner insists that she loves challenges -- "the 
more unusual the better." She creates air-filled and helium sculptures that 
last up to three weeks. The most common request, she says,is for an eight-foot 
white dove ($200) and a walk-through Valentine heart ($265). (714) 770-2376. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, whether you are a prince or a pauper, the most cherished gifts are 
the ones that money cannot buy: your time, affection, appreciation and respect. 
And a steamy love letter wouldn't hurt.

STYLE: MONOGRAMS PUT WARDROBES IN STITCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Lori Springer likes to see her name in print, or rather, in stitches. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach resident puts in a steady flow of orders to South Coast 
Monograms in Santa Ana to embroider her or her family's name on towels, 
turtlenecks, sweat shirts, sweaters and tennis outfits. 
</P>
<P>
Her relatives in Georgia and Wisconsin routinely receive gifts from the 
Springers neatly monogrammed with their names or initials. Springer has 
monogrammed her sister-in-law's tennis outfits, sweat suits for nieces and 
nephews, polo shirts for her husband, bibs for her 9-month-old twins and terry 
robes for practically everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole family loves monogramming," Springer says. "It personalizes the gift 
and dresses up the outfit. It does a lot for a bib or sweat shirt." 
</P>
<P>
The Springers are not alone in their mania for monogramming. 
</P>
<P>
While monogramming might be more common on the East Coast, where tastes lean 
more toward the traditional, in Orange County local monogrammers say there's a 
steadily growing demand for having one's initials emblazoned all over one's 
wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done everything from horse blankets to underwear," says Kandi Doyle, 
owner of A Custom Stitch in Fountain Valley. "People feel monogramming makes 
the item look more expensive and more elegant." 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of manufacturer's crests on ready-to-wear T-shirts and blouses 
has helped spark renewed interest in monogramming. 
</P>
<P>
"Why have someone else's initials on something when you can have your own?" 
asks Darlene Perreault, owner of Darlene the Monogrammer shop in San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my clients say they won't wear a shirt before I monogram it. It's a 
nice, clean look." 
</P>
<P>
Monogramming is to clothes what personalized license plates are to cars: 
Another way to stand out from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Many businessmen have taken to adding a personal touch to their corporate 
uniforms by discreetly monogramming their dress shirts with small initials on 
the cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a classy touch," says Marta Colmenares, who owns South Coast Monograms 
with her husband, Robert. Nordstrom, one of the shop's biggest clients, sends 
shirts over in bundles to be personally monogrammed for its customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some men even ask for white thread on a white shirt. You really can't see it, 
but they like it," Marta Colmenares says. 
</P>
<P>
A few customers have brought in a dozen shirts at a time for monogramming. One 
man wanted his initials stitched all over his shirt, on the collar, cuffs and 
the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked me if there was any other place on the shirt I could think for him to 
put it," Robert Colmenares says. "He wanted it everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Monograms aren't just for business. A woman spent $70 monogramming her entire 
devil costume for Halloween, right down to her red underwear. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to several walk-in monogramming shops, Orange County has at least a 
half-dozen monogrammers who work out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Most charge about $6 for a simple monogram, or higher for a more complex 
design. Fabric paint and press-on letters might be cheaper, but Perreault says 
her customers prefer embroidery because "it's a richer look." 
</P>
<P>
Monogrammers find that they can start their own business for relatively little 
money. Their greatest expense is the computerized monogramming machine, which 
looks like an oversize copy machine with a sewing machine on top, and can cost 
$15,000 to $20,000 used, and $40,000 or more new. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go into this as a hobby," says Perreault, who opened her 
monogramming shop four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
While they do need to know how to thread a needle, monogrammers need not be 
experts with a sewing machine. 
</P>
<P>
Kandi Doyle started A Custom Stitch out of her Fountain Valley home five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two children, and I was looking for something I could do in my home to 
bring in some extra income. Then I saw one of these monogramming computers and 
decided, 'I can punch buttons with the best of them.' I don't sew, but I can 
operate a computer." 
</P>
<P>
Monogrammers insert microcassette tapes into their machines that can produce a 
variety of stitches and designs, including bunnies, palm trees, sailboats, 
dolphins, hearts, flowers, or simple logos and artwork brought in by customers. 
</P>
<P>
The monogrammers determine the size of the design and placement of the letters 
by punching buttons on a keyboard. Then they stretch the fabric to be 
monogrammed tightly over a hoop and line it up under the needle. The machine 
does the rest, the needle flying back and forth in smooth satin stitches until 
the design is finished. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the work is computerized, a monogrammer needs to have an eye for 
color and space. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be part computer technician and part seamstress, with an artistic 
flair," Perreault says. "It helps if you have a picture in your head of what it 
might look like." 
</P>
<P>
She monograms VIP bathrobes for the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, jackets and 
polo shirts for Joan Irvine Smith's ranch, the Oaks, and satin jackets for its 
horseback riders. 
</P>
<P>
A horse lover who favors western apparel, Perreault also uses her machine to 
applique horses and fringe on sweat shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"I have these creative juices I have to release," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Monogramming has practical uses, too. Parents have their children's school 
clothes and sportswear monogrammed so they don't lose their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Many adults want their finer garments monogrammed to discourage theft and avoid 
mix-ups in the coat room. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a lot of names inside the lining of fur coats," Colmenares says. 
"Nobody wants to get furs mixed up."

A LAND DIVIDED: THE ARMENIA/AZERBAIJAN CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
CHAPTER 1: THE SPARK; 
</P>
<P>
LONG NIGHTS OF TERROR IN A BEAUTIFULLY RUGGED LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander Gulanerian watched in horror as a gang of young thugs dragged two 
Armenian men out of a nearby apartment building, bound them together in the 
street below his second-floor flat and casually set them on fire. 
</P>
<P>
He could hardly believe it was real -- until he heard the same mob break into 
his own building and clamber up the stairs. For him. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nowhere to go," he said days later from the safety of a hospital bed in 
Yerevan, the Armenian capital. "There was no time. We were there, waiting." He 
paused, shutting his painfully blackened eyes against the equally painful 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
The gang kicked in his door, he said, and without uttering a word started 
slashing his neck and feet with knives and broken bottles. Some also pummeled 
him with pipes, he said. Then they threw him out the window into the street. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing human in their faces, just brutality," Gulanerian, 42, 
recalled of his attackers. "There were about 40 of them, I think, all 
Azerbaijanis. They were maybe 16 years old, but already they have lost any 
trace of humanity in their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
When he regained consciousness, Gulanerian lay naked amid the corpses in a 
hospital morgue in Baku. He said he stayed there, unattended, for two days 
before shuffling out on his bloodied feet. Soviet soldiers took him to a ferry 
evacuating Armenians across the Caspian Sea to Krasnovodsk, in Soviet Central 
Asia, and then flown to Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
For all his trauma, emotional as well as physical, Gulanerian could in fact be 
looked on as fortunate -- if only because, having been swept up in the bloody 
Baku pogrom, he somehow survived. 
</P>
<P>
In four long nights of unspeakable terror and brutality, at least 72 of his 
fellow ethnic Armenians did not survive. They were rousted from their homes by 
lawless thugs, tortured and killed in an orgy of violence that brought two 
independent Soviet republics to the brink of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
The persecution unleashed Jan. 13 was neither the beginning nor the end of the 
frequently violent rivalry between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Indeed, it was not 
even the beginning of the most recent round of ethnic hatred in that ancient 
hillside oil port along the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Roving bands of angry, impoverished and embittered young Muslim Azerbaijani 
refugees had been swaggering around the steep and narrow streets of Baku for 
several days before the real brutality began, forcing Christian Armenian 
families out of their comfortable flats and moving in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But, perhaps inevitably, one of the illegal evictions went tragically wrong. 
One Armenian family finally refused to leave their apartment when the knock 
came at the door. In this case, the Azerbaijanis insisted, and words were 
exchanged. A scuffle broke out. An ax was produced. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, one Azerbaijani was dead and another was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, news of the confrontation spread to one of the massive rallies 
organized by the Azerbaijani Popular Front. Speakers who had spent weeks 
railing against the unfairness of Soviet rule now excitedly urged Azerbaijanis 
to avenge their dead brother. 
</P>
<P>
The brutality unleashed stunned the world. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs of Azerbaijani youths tore through Baku, savagely sacking Armenian 
apartments, raping women, and beating and killing men. Agitated by a long 
series of anti-Armenian speeches and leaflets and apparently aided by lists of 
Armenian families and their addresses, the mobs moved with surprising speed and 
ferocity. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness reports might have appeared unbelievable if there had not been so 
many of them, each confirming the others. They told of seeing Armenians thrown 
to their deaths from high-rise apartment buildings, of watching others tied 
together, soaked in gasoline and burned alive. Some Armenians were beaten with 
iron bars or hacked with knives; others were simply dragged to the street and 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
"They are beasts. They were killing, they were killing, they were burning. Oh, 
it is just to horrible to remember," said former Baku resident Lucia Vanian, 
75, after she was safely removed to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen murders here of the cruelest sort," a veteran Soviet journalist 
said after witnessing the initial violence. "Men, women and children, the young 
and the old alike, were attacked and often killed because they were Armenians. 
That alone -- to be Armenian in Azerbaijan -- was a virtual sentence of death." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the attacks were as petty as they were brutal: One old woman, for 
example, said her assailants took her false teeth before beating her and 
turning her out of her house in her nightclothes. 
</P>
<P>
Sofia Babakhanian recalled that she and her husband were watching television 
when a dozen Azerbaijanis burst into her apartment, brandishing knives and 
clubs and cursing all Armenians. After shoving her husband's head through a 
window, they put a knife to the 68-year-old woman's throat and tried to rape 
her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she said, the intruders settled for beating the elderly couple, 
smashing their furniture to kindling and leaving them to die on their living 
room floor. Two days later, the police came and took them out of Baku, where 
they were born and had spent their whole lives. 
</P>
<P>
For all such tales of barbarism, there were also tales of compassion. A number 
of Armenians were saved from death, if not homelessness, by sympathetic 
Azerbaijani neighbors who hid them from the mobs and helped them to reach one 
of the planes or boats that were ferrying Armenians to safety. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, at least 13,000 Armenians left the city in a mass evacuation, many 
of them after having been badly beaten and stripped of their homes and 
possessions. The Soviet Ministry of the Interior said 139 Azerbaijanis have 
been arrested for the violence. 
</P>
<P>
But the bloodshed in Baku -- and in the beautifully rugged, violently contested 
lands nearby -- was only beginning.

<P>
THE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Religious bigotry and ethnic hatred are at the top of the list of issues 
separating the two peoples. The Armenians -- mainly Christian for centuries -- 
see the Turkic-speaking Muslim Azerbaijanis as relatives of the Turks they hold 
responsible for a series of Armenian massacres, including the 1915 genocide in 
which more than 1 million Armenians were killed. For the Azerbaijanis, Islam is 
a central part of their national identity, and they regard the Armenians 
profession of Christianity as an assertion of unwarranted superiority. 
</P>
<P>
* Much of the conflict has also centered on the future of the Armenian enclave 
of Nagorno-Karabakh, inside the Soviet Socialist Republic of Azerbaijan, which 
wants to be part of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia. Although 
Nagorno-Karabakh does not border on Armenia, Armenians contend that this should 
not be an obstacle to the enclave's territorial transfer, noting that the 
Azerbaijani region of Nakhichevan -- sandwiched between Armenia and Iran -- 
lies more than 18 miles from the nearest Azerbaijani border. However, since the 
current strife erupted in February, 1988, the Kremlin has ruled out any 
redrawing of borders on the grounds that breaking the links forged between the 
rest of Nagorno-Karabakh and the rest of Azerbaijan would cause grave economic 
damage. Other factors, among them nationalism, contribute to the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The Spark 
</P>
<P>
* A rally in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku by tens of thousands of people 
demanding independence from the Soviet Union, gave way to anti-Armenian 
rioting. Armenians in the city were dragged from their homes, beaten and 
sometimes killed by roving gangs of Azerbaijanis. Thousands of Armenians in 
fear for their lives, fled to Armenia and Moscow. Rival militias made up of 
Armenians and Azerbaijanis took to the streets after capturing arms from Soviet 
military posts. Scores of people were killed in the first few days of fighting. 
The Soviet national government imposed a state of emergency in parts of 
Azerbaijan and dispatched about 10,000 peacekeeping troops from various 
branches of the military, the Interior Ministry and the KGB or secret police.

The initial orgy of violence in Baku quickly spread throughout both Azerbaijan 
and Armenia. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported new atrocities in 
the Azerbaijani capital -- including two Armenian men being burned to death 
just 20 yards from a police station -- and the Soviet government declared the 
first of many states of emergency in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration had little effect on rabid combatants bent on blood feud. Even 
as the state of emergency was being announced, agitated bands of Azerbaijani 
and Armenian men were breaking into police offices, military barracks and 
warehouses, searching for and seizing an impressive cache of weapons for their 
budding ethnic warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Irregular militias in both Armenia and Azerbaijan were swiftly formed and 
equipped with some of the best weapons in the Soviet arsenal -- late-model 
Kalashnikov assault rifles, medium and heavy machine guns, rockets, missile 
launchers, armored vehicles, even helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Armenia immediately deployed some of its volunteer troops to defend Armenian 
villages along the Azerbaijan border and in Nagorno-Karabakh, while others were 
being prepared for a 250-mile helicopter ride to protect Armenian civilians 
still in Baku. Azerbaijan, meanwhile, dispatched guerrillas to attack Armenians 
both in Nagorno-Karabakh and in the Khanlar and Shaumyan regions to the north 
of the disputed enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Ill-equipped and out-manned Interior Ministry defense forces were no match for 
the advancing ethnic armies; indeed, the conventional Soviet forces often found 
themselves forced to call in large numbers of airborne troops just to fight 
their way out through the swarming irregulars. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, the Azerbaijanis moved to sever all rail lines that pass 
through their territory into Armenia, thereby denying Armenia 85% of its food, 
fuel and building supplies. Fully 224 operational trains were bottled up, and 
another 109 trains were unable to move for lack of locomotives. Within days, 
fuel shortages begin to curtail cooking, heating and public transport in 
Yerevan. 
</P>
<P>
Ferries continued to evacuate Armenians from Baku at the rate of several 
thousand each day. Between occasional spasms of violence, the city appeared 
eerily calm, according to witnesses reached by telephone from Moscow. Outside 
observers were barred from the city, where it was said that 1,000 apartments 
had been sacked -- including some belonging to Soviet Army officers -- and 
their owners, if they were unlucky enough to be at home, were beaten or killed. 
</P>
<P>
Yerevan, on the other hand, bristled with activity. The Armenian capital looked 
like a city at war. Streets in the center of city were blocked off to all 
traffic except buses and trucks moving men and supplies to what many in the 
city now call "the front." Men in crisp new army fatigues keep order among the 
milling throngs of curious, slogan-shouting bystanders. Others, less grandly 
outfitted, dutifully loaded trucks or filed onto buses with their rifles and 
their bedrolls. 
</P>
<P>
These volunteers were boys still in their teens, puffed-up college students, 
rough-bearded men down from the mountains and a few real soldiers who had 
deserted the Soviet Army to defend their homeland. Some had modern automatic 
weapons, others made do with scrounged hunting rifles -- a few carried antique 
muzzle-loading muskets. Some had only their knives and their courage. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian nationalist Karabakh Committee stoked the flames of Armenian pride 
in a rally of 300,000 people jammed into the square in front of the opera 
house. Bring us clothes, people were asked; bring us food and medicine for 
those fighting "the Turks." But most important of all, speaker after speaker 
said, bring us your guns and your sons. 
</P>
<P>
Those appeals were aided greatly when, on Tuesday, Jan. 16, Yerevan started to 
receive the first of the wounded survivors of the pogrom in Baku. Their 
firsthand tales of the violence fueled the war tensions. Coincidentally or not, 
Armenians raided 16 more police stations, army posts and other government 
weapons caches that day, the Soviet Interior Ministry reported. 
</P>
<P>
With industry and commerce crippled by the rail blockade, many Armenians simply 
stayed home and listened to the radio or watched television for news of 
Azerbaijan. The news was not good. As combatants from both republics poured 
into the contested central region of Azerbaijan, fierce fire fights involving 
sometimes hundreds of men broke out. Small localized fighting that had dragged 
on uneventfully for months were suddenly flashing into full-scale battles in 
which armored vehicles dodged anti-tank rockets and heavy machine guns blasted 
away at helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
It took a good map or a great memory to keep track of the erupting battle 
zones: throughout Nagorno-Karabakh; along the Armenian borders with Azerbaijan 
and its allied autonomous region, Nakhichevan; and especially in the 
aggressively contested Khanlar and Shaumyan districts, where Azerbaijanis had 
laid siege to several Armenian villages. Strategically important hilltops and 
ridges were fought over for hours, in anticipation of a protracted mountain 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities scrambled to head off full-scale civil war by arresting 
26,000 people -- fully a fifth of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh -- and 
seizing 3,000 weapons. But the value of such actions was not immediately 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops landing in Azerbaijan found roads effectively blockaded with 
trucks and buses filled with civilians; when the soldiers tried to vault the 
roadblocks by air to avoid bloody confrontations, their helicopters came under 
heavy fire from stolen anti-aircraft guns. Snipers also harassed Soviet troops 
at regular intervals. 
</P>
<P>
In one illustrative case, a squad of eight Soviet troops that had been 
dispatched to defend the Armenian village of Manashit were overrun with heavy 
casualties by Azerbaijani guerrillas. Squad leader Capt. Viktor Spiridonov 
later said from a Yerevan hospital that the Azerbaijanis were not the rustic 
"bandits" his soldiers had expected, but were a well-organized, heavily armed 
partisan force. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Azerbaijani guerrillas took the fight to the front doors of 
both Armenians and the Soviet government. In one raid, they opened fire on 
Armenian villages within 20 miles of Yerevan killing six Armenian farmers. 
Meanwhile, Azerbaijanis laid siege to Soviet government buildings in Baku and 
several other cities, demonstrating against central government authority and 
Communist Party legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev eventually abandoned all hope of finding 
a political solution to what he believed to be essentially a political problem, 
and he put the Soviet Army on "full war footing." But the army's inability to 
immediately halt Azerbaijani aggression led to potentially devastating 
political problems -- Azerbaijan and Armenia both threatened to secede from the 
Soviet Union. Azerbaijan did so apparently with the idea that it had the 
military capability to repulse any Soviet attempt to keep it in the fold, while 
Armenia said it had no option but secession if the Soviets could not protect 
its people. 
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not support us in our struggle -- if it does not 
protect us from this terror and anger -- then it is very possible that the 
movement will take power into our own hands," warned Hambartsum Galstyan, a 
leader of the Karabakh Committee. "We fully accept responsibility for what we 
are doing, but we have no way out." 
</P>
<P>
Considering their sad fate over the centuries at the hands of Persian, Greek, 
Roman, Mongol, Russian and Turkish invaders, most Armenians -- upon learning 
about the Baku atrocities and subsequent attacks -- undoubtedly did believe 
they had no way out but to stand and fight for themselves.

ARMENIA'S ENEMIES NOT FORGOTTEN IN GLENDALE

<P>
Edna Petrosyan is only 6 years old, but she knows all about Armenia's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happening in Azerbaijan?" her father asks one recent evening, as the 
family chats over coffee and cookies with a friend in their Glendale apartment, 
just five weeks after the Petrosyans arrived from Soviet Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
Edna is tongue-tied. Her eyes dart back and forth from her parent's faces to 
the front door. The child of an Armenian neighbor upstairs is having a birthday 
party, and Edna wants to go. 
</P>
<P>
The mother brings Edna close to her lap, puts an arm around her shoulder and 
softly asks in Armenian: "What's that number you write down whenever I draw a 
cross?" Edna mumbles: "1915," the year hundreds of thousands of Armenians died 
at the hands of the Turks, victims of ethnic persecution. 
</P>
<P>
"Now recite that poem I taught you," Tello Petrosyan instructs her daughter. 
The child steps out of her mother's embrace, raises her head, puts her hands in 
her pockets and, with a face grave beyond her years, begins: 
</P>
<P>
"It's better that I be a dog or a cat, than a Turkish Barbarian . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The poem promises that "when the Armenian wind blows, it will not leave a 
single Turk standing in Armenian land." 
</P>
<P>
Edna's father asks again about the Azerbaijanis. She says: "They are killing 
Armenians again, they are torturing them." 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, she looks to her father, Souren Petrosyan, 33, and finds 
approval in his smiling brown eyes. "You may go now," he says, and Edna races 
up the stairs to join the party. 
</P>
<P>
It's a strange, bittersweet moment, perhaps impossible for non-Armenians to 
understand. But for the members of one of history's most tormented yet 
resilient races, the child's dark recital is a reaffirmation of its collective 
will to survive. 
</P>
<P>
To the Petrosyans, the pogroms in Azerbaijan -- in which dozens were recently 
killed -- and the devastating Armenian earthquake of December, 1988, are but 
the latest sad chapters of their people's past. 
</P>
<P>
That past, they believe, for good or for bad will mark Edna for the rest of her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
This is why, perhaps, while immigrants from all over the world try to blend 
into mainstream America, the approximately 400,000 Armenians in the United 
States make up one of the country's most close-knit ethnic communities. More 
than 80% of them live in Southern California. Upon arriving here, most settle 
in East Hollywood or Glendale, where many work, attend school, go to church and 
conduct business without ever speaking a word of English. 
</P>
<P>
About 35,000 Soviet Armenians have arrived in the United States since Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev relaxed immigration policies three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority had previously come to Armenia from Middle Eastern counties 
-- only to be disillusioned by the Soviet system -- before being allowed to 
come to the United States. The reason so few Armenians born and raised under 
Soviet domination leave is that they don't have relatives living abroad to 
sponsor them, immigration experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The Petrosyans, for example, moved from Iran to Armenia in 1975, as two young 
high school graduates with the patriotic aspiration of repopulating their 
homeland. A year later, they met at a Yerevan wedding, and seven months later 
they celebrated their own. 
</P>
<P>
"In Iran, we kept our language and our culture, and we dreamed of going to 
Armenia," said Souren Petrosyan, relishing the thought. "But we had no idea 
what the Soviet government was like." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Souren Petrosyan's family is here, and Tello Petrosyan is planning to 
bring hers to America as soon as she can. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Tello Petrosyan recalled, her brother was shot to death by 
Soviet soldiers as he tried to cross the Iranian border to attend their 
father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the turning point" that made them leave Armenia, she said gravely. 
Looking into her dark eyes, Souren Petrosyan makes a promise, one often heard 
throughout the Armenian Diaspora: "We will return to our country when Armenia 
is free." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's reforms, he said, have done little to change his mind. "For things 
to change," he said, "it's not a matter of Gorbachev listening to our questions 
-- he has to answer them, too" -- territorial questions, such as Armenia's 
claim to Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan; questions of 
economic freedom for Armenia, of cultural freedom for Armenians in Azerbaijan, 
of self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian community as a whole is widely successful in ventures ranging from 
politics to academia to real estate development. The newcomers, however, face 
an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
Souren Petrosyan faces the prospect of months of unemployment as he waits for 
an opening in an English class for Armenians at a local adult school. 
</P>
<P>
In Armenia, he had been a relatively well paid heavy equipment mechanic. Now he 
has to live off welfare, "sitting around with my arms folded," he snarls, until 
he learns the language. He seems unclear about his future, not too interested 
in what kind of job he lands. Edna will start public school soon, and her 
mother is worried. Recently, the mother and daughter signed up at the Glendale 
school district's "Welcome Center," where some four to six recently arrived 
Armenian families sign up their children for classes every day. 
</P>
<P>
Tello Petrosyan wishes they could afford a private Armenian school, where 
children are taught the language and the history of their people. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my children to grow up Armenian," said Tello Petrosyan, 27, with 
staunch determination. "That's the most important thing in the world for me."

As quickly as the new Communist leaders took office in Azerbaijan, they turned 
around and offered to share their power with the Azerbaijan Popular Front -- 
that is, those elements of the nationalist shadow government that had not been 
seized and jailed by Soviet authorities during the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 Azerbaijanis suspected of belonging to the front had been jailed to 
that point, crimping the group's effectiveness but not stopping it from 
pursuing a nettlesome harassment campaign against the government and the troops 
propping it up. 
</P>
<P>
"The Popular Front will be offered something, something substantial," a 
well-placed party source said. "It will not be as much as they want but . . . 
more than they could hope to win" by making good their threat to launch a 
prolonged guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to see peace there," the party official said. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, however, party-sanctioned peace in Baku was scuttled by political war 
in Moscow -- a messily public argument over the need to have sent troops into 
Baku and, by implication, the wisdom of relying on the Azerbaijani Popular 
Front as a political partner. 
</P>
<P>
While the new Azerbaijan Communist Party wooed the Azerbaijan Popular Front, 
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov publicly accused the rebel group of 
plotting to seize power with 40,000 militiamen on the day the Soviet army burst 
into Baku and put down the lingering unrest there at the cost of 83 lives by 
official count. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a slip of my tongue -- I mean power," Yazov told the Soviet 
government newspaper Izvestia in Baku, where he directed the weeklong operation 
to quell violence in the city. "They were preparing to seize it and were so 
sure of their success that . . . 24 hours before troops were introduced into 
Baku, they announced (their own) state of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
Yazov's inflammatory charges were countered by the release of a telegram sent 
to Gorbachev from two army colonels in Baku immediately before troops swept 
through the city. The officers -- identified as A. Savalyov, chairman of the 
officers' assembly in Baku, and A. Rusakov, head of the political section at 
the Baku Military Academy -- warned against military intervention. It did not 
mention the mobilization of rebel fighters or an imminent seizure of power by 
force. 
</P>
<P>
"The Popular Front controls the situation in the city," Savalyov and Rusakov 
said in the wire, according to an account in the newspaper Komsomolskaya 
Pravda. "We consider that the use of armed force would lead not merely to the 
isolation of servicemen but to a complete disruption in relations (with the 
local population), that it would threaten the security of their families and 
that it would trigger a growth in anti-Russian feeling." 
</P>
<P>
The argument even spread to the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, 13 members of 
which asked to debate the issue in an emergency session of the Supreme Soviet, 
the national legislature. 
</P>
<P>
While the central Soviet government fumbled, an independent nationalist group, 
the Latvian People's Front, brought the warring Armenians and Azerbaijanis to 
the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
The peace process actually began Jan. 25, when guns fell silent on the 
Armenia-Nakhichevan border with the signing of a cease-fire agreement between 
the Armenian All-National Movement and the Nakhichevan Popular Front -- 
significantly, independent nationalist organizations with real control over 
combatants. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes for a wider peace came a day later, when the Latvian People's Front 
announced that the Azerbaijani Popular Front, which controlled a larger area 
and a greater guerrilla force, also agreed to try to reach a similar agreement 
with the Armenian All-National Movement. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, pointedly, were scheduled in the Latvian capital of Riga -- itself 
the site of a significant nationalist and secessionist movement -- and 
effectively excluded the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Equally pointedly, the negotiations will not touch on the future of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, even though that Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan has been 
the focus of bitter and bloody warring between the two ethnic groups for the 
last two years -- indeed, to lesser extents, for the last 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the two groups agreed to limit their discussions to disengaging their 
paramilitary forces, easing tensions to avoid further clashes, exchanging 
hostages, resettling refugees and other humanitarian concerns.

Daniel M. Kearney, head of the Cabinet-level board overseeing the rescue of the 
nation's thrifts, resigned today, a board spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Kearney was brought in to head the Resolution Trust Corp. oversight board four 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The $164-billion bailout effort has been slow in getting off the ground and has 
been under heavy congressional criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The oversight board sets policy and direction for the government's effort to 
close hundreds of failed thrifts and dispose of billions of dollars of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Kearney was named chief executive of the oversight board Oct. 3. A prominent 
Wall Street real estate finance expert, he had served in the Nixon and Ford 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Kearney and other members of the board, including Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, have 
come under fire from the House Banking Committee, which is concerned with the 
slow pace of the thrift bailout.

VOLUNTEERS FIND BEACHES NOT AS FOULED AS FEARED

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the early scenes on television Thursday night, Marcelo Beleber expected to 
find ugly clumps of crude, black-tarred animals and general desecration of his 
favorite roller-skating beaches. 
</P>
<P>
What the 18-year-old Huntington Beach man actually found this morning when he 
hit the Newport shoreline with absorbent pads was by comparison a relief: a 
faint trail of black along the shore where perhaps less than a hundred gallons 
of oil had struck early the night before. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so bad," Beleber said with a smile as he worked on a spot of black 
just south of the Newport Pier, coming across occasional clumps of black goo. 
"They must have done a good job cleaning it up last night. I was expecting a 
lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
On one of the oddest beach days ever, hundreds of cleanup workers, volunteers, 
curiosity seekers, reporters and camera crews -- and even a few would-be 
entrepreneurs giving away promotional cleaning supplies -- swarmed the sands 
around the pier to see what the southern tip of this week's 300,000-gallon oil 
spill had left on their beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Most seemed relieved by what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
Beach-goers agreed that any marring of the coastline was a tragedy -- both 
environmentally and psychologically in a community that holds its beaches 
sacred; but, many said as they surveyed the scene, it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
The oil was visible in a jagged, faint swath of black, a few feet wide, that 
paralleled the shore. A few foamy oil bubbles remained from the night before. 
And the light smell of petroleum hit the air -- barely distinguishable, a few 
remarked, from the normal beach aromas of brine, fish and doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
Their observations jibed with reports from environmental officials who said 
that the impact of the oil hitting both Huntington and Newport beaches appeared 
relatively minor, and that the most sensitive coastal areas -- such as Bolsa 
Chica wetlands and wildlife reserve -- had not been affected so far. 
</P>
<P>
But even amid the relief that marked the sunny morning, there was anger. Around 
noon, word began to spread through the waves of cleanup volunteers about the 
unthinkable: they were not wanted there. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup coordinators with British Petroleum, which leased the ill-fated 
American Trader, told volunteers they were worried that people along the shore 
were exposing themselves to risk because they were not properly trained or 
outfitted for the venture. 
</P>
<P>
The official cleanup crews, some of whom said they were paid $12 an hour, wore 
bright yellow slickers, gloves and boots, and had reportedly been told just how

'60S ROCKER DEL SHANNON AN APPARENT SUICIDE VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Rock singer Del Shannon, who topped music charts in 1961 with the song 
"Runaway," was found dead Thursday, an apparent suicide, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, 55, was found about 11:25 p.m. by his wife, Bonnie, in the den of his 
home in the affluent Santa Clarita Valley enclave of Sand Canyon. The singer 
died from a gunshot wound to the head that appeared to be self-inflicted, said 
Deputy Bill Linnemeyer of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
A .22-caliber rifle lay by Shannon's side, Linnemeyer said. He said no suicide 
note was found. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's homicide detectives were investigating Shannon's death this morning, 
and an autopsy was planned. 
</P>
<P>
Before adopting the stage name Del Shannon, the singer was known as Charles 
Weeden Westover. With his falsetto voice, Shannon became a major star on the 
American rock scene prior to the British rock 'n' roll band invasion of the 
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, who was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., began his music career by singing 
in clubs in his home state after his discharge from the Army in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
His first hit came in 1961, with the gold record "Runaway." The song topped 
music charts for four weeks in 1961. It was his biggest hit. 
</P>
<P>
Although he never duplicated that success, Shannon hit the charts with "Do You 
Want to Dance," "Keep Searchin'," and "Hey Little Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Other songs included "Hats Off to Larry," "Little Town Flirt" and "Handy Man." 
He also composed the 1965 hit "I Go to Pieces" for the English duo Peter and 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Shannon attempted an unsuccessful comeback with the album "Drop Down 
and Get Me." It was the old Shannon people wanted to hear, and the singer 
worked throughout the 1980s singing his hits from two decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"He was somebody who still had a lot of talent and a lot to contribute, but 
apparently couldn't find an outlet for it," Jay Rose, a disc jockey for KODJ, 
an oldies radio station in Los Angeles, told United Press International.

GORBACHEV SEEKS MUTUAL CUTTING OF EUROPEAN FORCES

<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev proposed today that the United States and 
the Soviet Union each cut back to 195,000 troops in Europe, excluding Soviet 
territory, Tass press agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposal, made in talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, 
accepted figures offered by President Bush last month but apparently refused to 
accept that an extra 30,000 U.S. troops could be stationed outside central 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush proposed that each superpower should retain 195,000 men in central Europe 
but that the United States could keep 30,000 more in Britain, Italy, Greece and 
Turkey without a matching Soviet deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal was formally made Thursday at the Vienna talks between NATO and 
the Warsaw Pact on reducing non-nuclear forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying that if the 195,000 figure was unacceptable, 
the Soviet Union proposed a ceiling of 225,000 troops apiece in Europe, 
excluding Soviet territory. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposals appeared to indicate that Moscow is not ready to accept 
that the United States should keep more troops in Western Europe than the 
Soviet Union has in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has about 575,000 troops in Eastern Europe, and the United 
States has about 305,000 in Western Europe, according to Western figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Tass report came after Gorbachev and Baker met for nearly four hours on the 
third day of the secretary's visit. 
</P>
<P>
Baker saw Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze before and after his 
meetings with Gorbachev. U.S. officials said their focus was on arms control, 
which experts from the two sides tried to advance during the day at their own 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the "discussion of the disarmament problem is proceeding very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev spoke on a wide range of other issues before going into his meeting 
with Baker today, including his own future as head of the Communist Party now 
that the Central Committee has decided to revoke the party's monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how the action would affect him, Gorbachev said, "I would not think 
anything particular happened to me. What we wanted to achieve at this plenum we 
did achieve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the changes began when he attained power five years ago and "once we 
have solidified this phase we will move further." 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly would be wrong for the West and everyone to believe we began 
these changes only in the last few days," he said. "They have been under way 
since 1985." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev gave a guarded answer when asked if he would run for president on the 
Communist Party ticket if the country implements a new, stronger office chosen 
by a contested election. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's wait and see," he told reporters.

IKE'S GRANDCHILD MARRIES SOVIET SCIENTIST; 
</P>
<P>
RELATIONS: ONE RUSSIAN GUEST SAID THE WEDDING OF SUSAN EISENHOWER AND ROALD 
SAGDEYEV SYMBOLIZES THAT AMERICANS AND RUSSIANS CAN GET TOGETHER.

<P>
It was a union filled with symbolism -- the granddaughter of a former U.S. 
President marrying a prominent Soviet scientist with a traditional ceremony and 
a reception that reeked of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time today to cut an enormous wedding cake, Susan Eisenhower 
and Roald Sagdeyev did what any couple would do. They smiled and kissed and 
then blushed in front of about 100 smiling American and Soviet guests. 
</P>
<P>
The couple married during a 40-minute ceremony inside a ballroom converted to a 
chapel at the home of the U.S. ambassador. The reception was held inside a 
large blue-and-white room filled with marble columns, glittery chandeliers and 
avant-garde paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The guests nibbled crab and two colors of caviar and sipped champagne. It was a 
presentation of the finest wares capitalism has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold war is over," said Yuri Ossipiam, a guest who is the vice chairman of 
the Soviet Academy of Sciences. "The wedding symbolizes that Americans and 
Russians can have a normal relationship in state and personally speaking." 
</P>
<P>
Tass press agency -- which ordinarily does not cover weddings or personal 
events -- expressed a similar sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were not for the high position of the bride and groom, which has turned 
their love story into a real sensation, there would have been nothing unusual 
in forming one more Soviet-American family union," the agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower, 38, is the granddaughter of former U.S. President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Sagdeyev, 57, is a radical member of the Soviet Parliament and a rocket 
scientist who has pushed for joint U.S.-Soviet ventures to the planet Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower has been married twice before and has three children, ages eight to 
17. Sagdeyev is divorced and has two grown children. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1988, Sagdeyev directed one of the country's most respected 
organizations, the Institute of Space Research, which is part of the Soviet 
Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
The two met at a U.S.-Soviet conference in the United States about two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
As they mingled among their famous guests, including Soviet Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, it was hardly imaginable that one came from a 
country once referred to by former President Ronald Reagan as the "Evil 
Empire." 
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy," said Eisenhower during the reception, as she walked down a 
long marble staircase with a bouquet of white irises cradled in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
The couple first exchanged vows earlier in the day in a typical Soviet civil 
ceremony at a wedding palace. The ceremony was much more sober than the one 
held before a Protestant minister at the American ambassador's home. 
</P>
<P>
During that ceremony, Eisenhower walked down the aisle in a white wool suit 
with gold trim while Sagdeyev waited at the altar. A choir sang traditional 
music.

BONN DENIES EXPECTING COLLAPSE OF ECONOMY IN EAST GERMANY

<P>
West Germany, pushing for monetary union and political unification with East 
Germany, stirred up an embarrassing row today over its partner's economic 
health. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started when a senior Bonn official raised the prospect of an 
imminent East German economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting on anonymity, he told reporters: "There are signs that, in only a few 
days, East Germany could become insolvent." 
</P>
<P>
It was this prospect, he said, that prompted West Germany on Wednesday to 
suggest immediate talks with East Germany on a plan to introduce the 
Deutschmark in the East to shore up its economy. 
</P>
<P>
But official spokesmen for West Germany and for the East German government, led 
by Hans Modrow, quickly denied that Bonn believed an East German economic 
collapse was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Said East Berlin government spokesman Wolfgang Mayer: "As long as the Modrow 
government is in power, East Germany will not become unable to meet its payment 
(obligations)."

Taiwan legislators kicked, punched and screamed their way into a new session 
today as the opposition stepped up demands for the resignation of aging 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition legislators fought with delegates appointed to represent overseas 
Chinese communities, attempting to keep them from attending a swearing-in 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony began while the legislators were still screaming and fighting. 
</P>
<P>
An aide to one of the overseas Chinese representatives yelled at protesters: 
"If I were in America now, I'd take my gun and shoot all of you." 
</P>
<P>
During the singing of the national anthem, opposition member Wu Yung-hsiung 
leaped onto the podium and started screaming abuse at the overseas Chinese 
delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Even after he was dragged down, Wu, wearing a bright orange costume festooned 
with slogans, continued to scream as legislators raised their arms to be sworn 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Only 101 members of the legislature were selected on Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
The majority -- 162 -- represent the seats they were first elected to in China 
before the ruling Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan from the Communist victory 
on the mainland in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 29 representatives are appointed to represent overseas Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Chaos was also the dominant theme during registration for the National 
Assembly, a separate body which next month elects Taiwan's president and vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition politicians forcibly tried to keep the members -- in their 80s and 
90s -- who dominate the assembly from signing in, pushing at least one old man 
to the ground and grabbing pens from members' hands. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't touch me; my health is bad," one old assemblyman screamed. "If I die you 
must answer for my murder." 
</P>
<P>
Some relatives escorting the assemblymen pleaded with protesters to leave the 
old people alone. "They have high blood pressure; you can't do this to them," 
one woman said. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition politicians were unmoved. 
</P>
<P>
"We want all the people to see how ridiculous our National Assembly is," said 
Hung Chi-chang, an opposition legislator.

Israel and Czechoslovakia today renewed diplomatic relations, rectifying what 
Prague's foreign minister called the "nonsense" of rupturing ties in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we have taken the first step (toward) very good and very friendly 
relations," Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said after signing the 
agreement with his Czechoslovak counterpart, Jiri Dienstbier. 
</P>
<P>
Dienstbier and Arens voiced hope that the resumption of ties would lead to 
trade and increased cooperation between Israel and Czechoslovakia, which was 
one of Israel's strongest supporters when it was founded in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Arens paid tribute to Prague's supplies of weapons and training of air force 
pilots then, noting that "Czechoslovakia was one of the few nations that lent 
important assistance to Israel in its hour of need during the war of 
independence in 1948."

<P>
James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, said today that New Zealand "is free of, and has adequate defenses 
against, honey bee diseases and parasites and undesirable species of honey 
bees, so our import restrictions can now be removed." 
</P>
<P>
However, Glosser said the proposed rule change would allow only non-stop 
shipments from New Zealand to ensure the health of bees and semen entering the

Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., one of the world's largest advertising agencies, 
pleaded guilty today to making $130,000 in illegal payments in its efforts to 
win the contract for the Jamaican tourism account. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based company was fined $500,000 for conspiring to violate the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making payments to a Jamaican businessman, 
Arnold Foote Jr., who in turn made payments to Eric Anthony Abrahams, the 
former minister of tourism in Jamaica, said U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley A. Twardy. 
</P>
<P>
The government alleged that Young &amp; Rubicam made the payments in order to 
win and retain the lucrative Jamaican tourism account, for which it produced 
the award-winning "Come Back to Jamaica" campaign in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The government, citing "exculpatory evidence recently turned over to the 
government," dropped charges against two Young &amp; Rubicam executives, 
executive vice president Arthur R. Klein and former account supervisor Thomas 
Spangenberg. 
</P>
<P>
A third Young &amp; Rubicam worker, Steven M. McKenna, faces federal perjury

AUSTRALIA'S BOND CORP. LOSES COURT BATTLE

Entrepreneur Alan Bond's embattled flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. lost a 
major battle today when it failed to persuade a court to lift its prized 
Australian breweries out of receivership. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Barry Beach ruled in Victoria's Supreme Court after a monthlong case 
that Bond Brewing Holdings should remain under control of a court-appointed 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Bond Corp., caught up in a morass of legal action and burdened with $4.9 
billion in debt, said it will appeal the decision as soon as possible. Its key 
Australian breweries, including Fourex and Swan, said they will apply for a 
stay of the ruling pending an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Lucas, a Bond Corp. director, said before the judgment that the 
receivership order, obtained by a bank syndicate led by National Australia 
Bank, could have a domino effect and lead to the collapse of the rest of the 
media and property empire. 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled that the syndicate, owed $530 million by Bond Brewing, was 
entirely justified in seeking the receivership order, which was granted Dec. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bond Brewing deliberately tried to keep people with any knowledge of 
the Bond group's affairs away from court, and said he found it extraordinary 
that Bond Brewing had excluded relevant material from the case. 
</P>
<P>
The company's U.S. breweries, including Wisconsin's G. Heileman Brewing Co., 
were not included in the receivership order. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Bond Media, which is 51% owned by Bond Corp., won a 
reprieve from immediate repayment of a $275-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
The bank syndicate agreed not to take further action to recover the money until 
March 28. National Australia took Bond Media to court last week to demand 
immediate repayment.

ARREST ORDER ISSUED FOR CRAZY EDDIE IN STOCK PROFITS CASE

A federal judge issued an arrest warrant today for Eddie Antar, telling 
marshals to "spare no expense" to locate the founder of the Crazy Eddie chain 
so that he can explain his refusal to hand over $52 million in alleged illegal 
stock profits. 
</P>
<P>
"I have given this man seven, 14, I believe 16, days to comply with this 
court's order to repatriate the money and to turn it over to a 
trustee-receiver," U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan said, finding Antar in 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I ask you to spare no expense. I want this man found." 
</P>
<P>
Antar's lawyers produced an affidavit signed Tuesday, in which he asserted his 
Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying against himself. But the judge said 
the privilege could only be taken in person. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in a paper chase here. We're in a human chase," Politan said.

TRYING TO GET OSCAR'S ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Batman" grossed more than $250 million in America and almost as much in other 
nations, while "Driving Miss Daisy" has barely cracked the $25-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Warner Bros. is spending about as much on an Academy Award campaign for 
"Daisy" and its stars, Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, as on "Batman" and its 
headliners, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
Warner's is not alone. From "Glory" to "Born on the Fourth of July," most of 
the movies expected to get Oscar nominations Wednesday are fairly recent 
releases whose box office takes do not rival such record-setting early- and 
mid-1989 successes as "Batman," "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" or "Honey, 
I Shrunk the Kids." 
</P>
<P>
So what does it take to get a nomination? Obviously, box office appeal is not 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
"We use our heads to determine what we think will please the Academy members," 
said Rob Friedman, president of Warner Bros.' worldwide advertising and 
publicity wing. Friedman's department decides which of the studio's pictures 
get a big push. 
</P>
<P>
"You generally know what the critics have said, and you make an educated 
guess," he said. "It's like handicapping." 
</P>
<P>
Other elements are also at work. One show business insider noted that Warner's 
is pushing "Daisy" and Paramount is hyping "Born on the Fourth" for Oscars 
because the films the two companies released last summer are just about played 
out. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Batman' and 'The Last Crusade' each made over $200 million," he said. "No 
one who wants to see either one of them has not already seen them. So all the 
juice has been squeezed out of those apples. 
</P>
<P>
"Even one nomination for a picture like 'Daisy' will lure a hell of a lot more 
people into the theaters. But a nomination wouldn't do a thing for 'Batman.' " 
</P>
<P>
So the movie industry trade papers were filled with full-color, double-truck 
ads for movies like "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Born on the Fourth of July" from 
Christmas until early February, when Academy members had to send in their 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oscars' top executive thinks the campaigns make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ad campaigns matter only in a very peripheral sense," said Bruce 
Davis, executive director of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
"They may remind our members of what is eligible. . . . But their real purpose 
may be to help with morale within a studio and with keeping some talent happy 
as the studio looks toward its next project."

A Valentine's Day concert by LaToya Jackson has been canceled because her 
presence would violate the values of Malaysian culture, the Culture and Tourism 
Ministry said today. 
</P>
<P>
The department secretary, Mukhtar Abdullah, said Jackson, who posed nude in 
Playboy magazine last year, did not meet some of the conditions imposed by the 
government on foreign artists performing in Malaysia. He did not say what these 
conditions were. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised the promoter, Genesis Promotions, went ahead through 
newspapers and television ads without getting the ministry's approval.

Harrison Ford, Chevy Chase and Sean Connery are here at the annual convention 
of theater owners, but the people at Proctor Cos. swear the biggest star around 
is Proctor's new nacho cheese dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of a theater's profits are generated at the concession stand, and 
many of the 3,000 executives gathered for the National Assn. of Theater Owners 
ShoWest trade meeting are seeking every opportunity to squeeze the snack bar 
for a few more dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Given that motivation, Hollywood superstars, previews of upcoming attractions 
and endless cocktail parties take a back seat to such inventions as the $450 
Hot Topper, which Proctor says can squirt out melted nacho cheese, fudge or 
butter without mess and little waste. 
</P>
<P>
And what food innovation will you see soon at a theater near you? Perhaps iced 
cappuccino, which comes in three flavors -- chocolate, amaretto and classic -- 
and will sell for about $1.50.

Spike Lee, creator of "Do the Right Thing," says he's the only filmmaker 
criticized for not showing drugs in his movies. 
</P>
<P>
Critics complained that his 1989 film dealing with race relations in New York 
City was unrealistic because the streets were clean and the characters weren't 
shown using drugs, Lee told an audience at the University of Rochester on 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs are not the unique domain of black people," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
He said black people have to make their own movies to be in control of their 
own image. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks know a lot about the white world, because we're a minority living in 
it," he said. "But whites don't know anything about black culture. What blacks 
does Steven Spielberg know? Quincy Jones? Michael Jackson? Maybe Prince? They 
aren't regular black people. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood is a closed community and they're out of touch."

The Legislature passed a resolution Wednesday commending the country music 
stars for their success and for their charitable work.

The four band members appeared on the House floor to accept the award, and lead 
singer Joe Bonsall thanked the House members. He said the band loved the state 
and "always felt like we should give a little back."

The resolution cited the band's two platinum and nine gold albums and praised

William Reid, founder of the band The Jesus and Mary Chain, said mum's the word 
on stage -- unless he's singing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you make a record, you don't introduce the songs. . . . It would break 
the spell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing on stage is kind of magical, and when people stand up there and start 
saying things, it breaks the spell. 
</P>
<P>
"If I go see a group, I want to see them playing as hard and as good as they 
can. I want the music to be one intense, long flow. I don't want people to talk 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
Reid said he has broken his rule of on-stage silence only one time in five 
years -- and that was because he was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
"I was abusing them. I was insulting them," he said. "The next day I was 
embarrassed. I regretted it."

President Bush presented the fourth annual Flo Hyman award today to Chris

country with great sportsmanship and dignity." 
</P>
<P>
"We will all miss you on the professional tennis circuit. 
</P>
<P>
(Tennis rivals) Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver may not miss you," Bush 
said, drawing laughter from a gathering of standout female athletes. "But we 
will." 
</P>
<P>
The Flo Hyman award for courage and dedication is named for the Olympic 
volleyball star who died in 1986. It is sponsored by the Women's Sports 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Evert, 35, retired from professional tennis last year after winning 18 Grand 
Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris, you long represented not just the game of tennis but your country with 
great sportsmanship and dignity," Bush said. "You are a role model for our

BASEBALL OWNERS AFFIRM PLAN FOR LOCKOUT AT SPRING TRAINING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball owners today reiterated their plan for a spring training lockout but 
seemed to soften their hard-line stance. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in our strategy," Milwaukee owner Bud Selig said. "But 
there is going to be another meeting with the players on Monday, and this is 
going to be a day-by-day negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Camps are scheduled to open Thursday. Clubs have been told by the owners not to 
start spring training unless an agreement is reached with players on a new 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Selig, chairman of the owners' Player Relations Committee, tried to avoid the 
word "lockout." When pressed, he said, "nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck O'Connor, management's chief negotiator, said, "The clubs are not free to 
go to camp on Feb. 15." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent, who attended the two-hour meeting with owners, said 
he hoped something could be accomplished in next week's bargaining sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm eager to find a resolution to this problem. I am trying, in a way I hope 
is relevant, to be useful," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the efforts will be very intensive to reach an agreement 
in the nearest possible time frame. Will that happen? I have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., was 
about to enter a meeting with players in Phoenix when owners announced their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so unnecessary," said Fehr, who met with 50 players in Los Angeles on 
Thursday night. "This is a lockout in an industry that just signed a 
billion-and-a-half dollar television contract. It's going to be very difficult 
to generate any kind of sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a demand by the owners to tie player salaries to the amount of 
money the teams make. Such an arrangement would in effect cap salaries. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the owners want to make performance on the playing field a 
determining factor in how much players are paid in their first six years in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Selig said the owners endorsed the strategy that the negotiating committee has 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously if on Feb. 15 there is no agreement, the camps won't be opened," he 
said. "We're going to take each day and each week as it comes and get this 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The players are seeking an increase in the minimum salary from $68,000 to 
$125,000 and oppose any proposals that would put a lid on how high salaries can 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
Some star players have reached stratospheric salary levels, with several 
receiving contracts worth more than $3 million a year in recent months, led by 
Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to lock the spring training gates was the second such move by the 
owners since 1976 when a 22-day stoppage occurred. That was halted on orders 
from then-Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, and the regular season opened on schedule.

Kristi Yamaguchi, who goes for her second pairs title tonight with partner Rudi 
Galindo, is seeking to become the first woman in 50 years to win both a U.S. 
pairs and singles crown in the same U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Yamaguchi was third behind Jill Trenary and Tonya Harding after Thursday's 
women's original program. Trenary kept her lead -- barely -- despite falling 
during her required double-axel jump in the women's original program because 
she had won the compulsories Wednesday. Saturday's long program counts for 50% 
of the scoring.

Guitarist Brennan Totten, who toured for a few years with Jonathan Richman's 
Modern Lovers, can recall an occasion when he was pulled over by a state 
trooper while driving the band through Texas. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a routine traffic citation wound up with the officer giving them 
the third degree, having been discomfited by the sight of Richman, star of the 
international stage and recording world, perched barefoot and birdlike on the 
rear seat, all-but heedless of the police presence as he shoveled down a quart 
of Haagen-Dazs with an unnerving abandon. 
</P>
<P>
Richman really likes to eat. Driving to Orange County from his Northern 
California home, he will pick up a Harris Ranch pie and eat it by the handful, 
along with yogurt, Cornnuts, malteds and the standard road food cornucopia. At 
2 a.m. in a coffee shop, he'll have the chili, the banana pancakes and the 
onion rings. 
</P>
<P>
His current "Jonathan Richman" album contains a bit of oratory that addresses 
this subject, "I Eat With Gusto, Damn! You Bet." And therein lies one of the 
constants of Richman's work: He sings about the things he has a passion for. 
</P>
<P>
That he -- given his caloric intake -- doesn't possess the approximate bulk of 
a water bed says something about the nature of Richman's passions: He tends to 
do most things with gusto, so energetically tackling every moment that one 
suspects he even slumbers with a taxing enthusiasm. If a phone conversation 
with him sounds just a bit disjointed, it's probably because he's 
simultaneously flipping on his backyard trampoline. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, when he was a self-described "brooding Angst-ridden adolescent," 
Richman recorded "The Modern Lovers," an album sufficiently dark and uptight to 
influence the Sex Pistols and a host of other glum chums, and to be regarded 
more recently by Rolling Stone magazine as No. 52 in its list of the "100 Best 
Albums of the Last 20 Years." 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, though, Richman's songs instead have evoked a world that's 
loose and limber, where, when "your friends are dancing on the lawn, no one 
acts like something's wrong"; where love and romance win out over fear; and 
where one can be snared passionately by the life reaching out from Van Gogh 
paintings, a sleeping wife, old corner stores, a hot summer night, or even 
discarded chewing gum wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
One of the 38-year-old's present enthusiasms is surf music; a desire to play 
some twang-oriented bills led to his shows with "King of the Surf Guitar" Dick 
Dale tonight at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and Saturday at Bogart's 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Orange County two weeks ago, Richman claimed: "The fixation with surf 
guitar isn't recent. It's something people were comparing my guitar style to 
even when I was starting out. It's part of my guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
"The new fixation is wanting to be part of the Southern California music scene 
because I'm lonely up there in Northern Cal right now. The closest music scene 
I can think of to what I'm doing is surf music, at least of the music that's 
still being played now in California." 
</P>
<P>
Richman won't be particularly more surf-bent at these shows than he's ever been 
-- indeed, he's recently taken to accompanying himself with only a 
nylon-stringed classical guitar. But he sees several connections between the 
two types of music. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, there's a strong love of nature in both styles -- it's 
physical. And second, there's also a kind of dreaminess in surf music that is 
also in mine. The way they describe a scene with guitars, I tend to describe it 
more with words, but with both you're supposed to feel it rather than 
understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"Another reason why I like playing with surf acts is both styles are party 
music, as far as I'm concerned. I don't want it to be a concert. I want it to 
be like a party, which to me is where you feel loose enough to dance, without 
anybody making a big deal out of it, and where you have a lot of fun. I think 
once rock 'n' roll got taken seriously, it ruined everything." 
</P>
<P>
Although Richman rhapsodizes about the surf scene and wanting to take part in 
the sort of 12-act rock-and-roll cavalcades that rumbled through the states in 
the '50s, he insists he's not living in the past but rather hoping for a future 
when our pop culture may get back that early warmth and innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be part of something new," he said. "I've been lonely for stuff 
before, but now is the time when I sense something different could happen. And 
I also think that these '80s were lonely enough where I just want to reach out 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"That's also why I'm doing my country record (due out on Rounder later this 
year). I want to be a part of there being more communication between different 
kinds of musicians." (Victor Borge is Richman's favorite stage performer. He 
also has a warm regard for the early Iggy Pop.) 
</P>
<P>
And what makes him think the '90s can be different from the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even have a clue. I just want it to be. I'm ready for the '90s. I 
didn't like the '80s. It was just so distant. Great things happened to me 
personally in the '80s, but overall it was just a decade where more people 
drove by, and less where they got out of the car and shook hands." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of his harsher critics seem to presume that Richman gets his 
hopeful view of the world from the Care Bears, he is distressingly well-read on 
the sorry ecological, political and cultural state of things. But he chooses to 
think some good eventually may come from our overstressed times. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," he said, "I think L.A. may be one of the first cities to get a 
really terrific public transportation system because the pollution is getting 
so bad, I think it's going to push it in that good direction. And overall, I 
think when things get isolated so much, like they did in the '80s, people will 
get tired of it and want to get closer." 
</P>
<P>
While the song "Closer" on the "Jonathan Richman" album is about his wife, 
Gail, closer also describes Richman's professional direction. The ideal 
performance to him is one where the audience shows "lots of emotion: I want to 
see lots of gnashing of teeth and beating on chests, weeping and wailing. I 
want to see crying and dancing in the streets." 
</P>
<P>
To that end he employs the nylon-string guitar and performs solo because the 
nakedness of thesound makes for a more intimate show -- "I was pretty 
spontaneous anyway with a band; now I'm unstoppable." He thinks volume has its 
place in teen-age music but likens his over-amped contemporaries to "seeing 
your dad at the intersection revving the engine of his sports car. It's 
embarrassing." In a bio sent to fans last year, he described high-volume as 
"not a necessity but a hindrance to communication and intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
He's not one to go for technological blockades on his records either. Most of 
the "Jonathan Richman" album was first-take material, with only his stamping 
feet accompanying his guitar and vocals on several tracks. (Two instrumentals, 
"Blue Moon" and "Sleepwalk," feature longtime bass associate Curly Keranen and 
the late Ron Wilson, creator of what is undoubtedly the world's most copied 
drum solo, the original "Wipeout.") 
</P>
<P>
The record not only contains mistakes, but also has a song extolling them, "A 
Mistake Today for Me." There is the French-language "Que Reste-T-ll de Nos 
Amours?" from French balladeer Charles Trenet, while "Fender Stratocaster" 
paints a rocking, shimmering impressionistic vision of that O.C.-born electric 
guitar: 
</P>
<P>
 Like the wind in your hair when the top is down, 
</P>
<P>
 Like taillights headed for another town, 
</P>
<P>
 Fender Stratocaster, there's something about that sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I started playing music when I was 17, I wanted to be a painter," 
Richman recalls. "Then I realized I could make stuff happen right in front of 
people, not just do it at home and have them see it later. Once I saw that, I 
said, 'Whooa! That's what I want to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's still the case. "I promised myself then that I'd quit if it ever became 
work instead of fun. It would really take some searching to find something I'd 
enjoy nearly as much as this." 
</P>
