<TEXT>
<P>
Antonetta Ferraro, 84, mother of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine 
Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
"I always said I had two role models in life," said Geraldine Ferraro, the 
Democratic nominee for vice president in 1984. "One was Eleanor Roosevelt and 
one was Antonetta Ferraro. She worked all her life. She worked in sweatshops 
when they were really sweatshops. She learned a trade at 13 that put me through 
law school." Geraldine Ferraro's father died in 1943. In New York City on Feb. 
2 of emphysema and cancer.

ALLEN BARKE; LED FORD'S BRITISH SUBSIDIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allen Barke, 86, who rose from a car factory timekeeper to be chief executive 
of the British subsidiary of the U.S. auto maker Ford. In 1932, Barke 
hitchhiked 180 miles to Dagenham in East London, where Ford's huge complex was 
under construction. 
</P>
<P>
He asked at the factory gates of Briggs motor bodies -- then the supplier of 
most of Ford's auto bodies in Britain -- for any job they had. He was hired as 
a timekeeper and rose through the company. In 1953, when Ford's British 
subsidiary took over Briggs, Barke was given the job of merging the companies. 
He became director of Ford's product division in 1959 at a time when the 
company's plants were being increasingly hit by wildcat strikes. But in 1965, 
Barke contracted hepatitis, and poor health soon forced him to resign. In 
London on Jan. 29.

LORD MACLEAN; CHAMBERLAIN TO QUEEN ELIZABETH II

<TEXT>
<P>
Lord Maclean, the former chief official of Queen Elizabeth II's household and 
organizer of the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles, has died, his family announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Maclean was 73 when he died Thursday at Hampton Court Palace, a former royal 
residence in London, where he had been chief steward since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement gave no cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
The Scottish baron became lord chamberlain in 1971. Before he retired in 1984, 
he had established a reputation as a perfectionist in royal ceremonies while 
overseeing the queen's household. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son, and Lady Diana Spencer 
in St. Paul's Cathedral was a highlight of his term. 
</P>
<P>
Maclean's first ceremonial assignment as lord chamberlain was the 1972 funeral 
of the Duke of Windsor, who as King Edward VIII had abdicated the throne in 
1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
Royalty watchers noted with approval that Maclean did not bow when he said 
farewell to the duke's widow as she left. 
</P>
<P>
Maclean also organized the silver wedding celebration of Queen Elizabeth II and 
her husband, Prince Philip, that year.

GUN NUTS HAVE A REAL POINT; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTITUTION: THE CLIMATE MAY NOW BE RUNNING IN FAVOR OF MORE RESTRICTIONS, 
INCLUDING A BAN ON HANDGUNS. BUT THERE'S STILL THE SECOND AMENDMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KINSLEY, Michael Kinsley writes the TRB column for The New Republic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around the world, national theologies are crumbling: communism, apartheid and, 
here in America, the worship of guns -- to foreigners, the single craziest 
thing about us. 
</P>
<P>
Do you sense an outbreak of sanity about gun control? I do. There was retired 
Chief Justice Warren Burger preaching sacrilege on the cover of Parade magazine 
a couple of weeks ago. A Time Magazine/Cable News Network poll reports that 87% 
of gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handgun 
purchases; three-quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and 
handguns, and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there is the Second Amendment to the Constitution: "A well 
regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right 
of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." 
</P>
<P>
Most right thinkers take comfort in that funny stuff about the militia. Since 
the amendment's stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it 
creates no individual right to own a gun. That reasoning is good enough for the 
ACLU. But would civil-libertarians be so stinting about an amendment they felt 
more fond of? Say, the First? 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the First Amendment's free-speech guarantee was pretty clearly 
to protect political discourse. But liberals reject the notion that free speech 
is therefore limited to political topics, even broadly defined. True, that 
purpose is not inscribed in the amendment itself. But why leap to the 
conclusion that a broadly worded constitutional freedom ("the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms") is narrowly limited by its stated purpose, 
unless you're trying to explain it away? A colleague says that if liberals 
interpreted the Second Amendment the way they interpret the rest of the Bill of 
Rights, there would be law professors arguing that gun ownership is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
The most thorough parsing of the Second Amendment is a 1983 article in the 
Michigan Law Review by Don Kates, a gun enthusiast. Kates expends most energy 
demonstrating that at the time of the Bill of Rights, all able-bodied men were 
considered to be part of the "militia" and were expected to defend the state if 
necessary. I'm not sure this is as clinching an argument as Kates seems to 
think. The fact that once upon a time everyone was a member of the militia 
doesn't prove that everyone still has a right to a gun even after the 
composition of the militia has changed. 
</P>
<P>
But Kates has other bullets in his belt. The phrase "right of the people" 
appears four other times in the Bill of Rights (including the First Amendment). 
In all these other cases, everyone agrees that it creates a right for 
individual citizens, not just some collective right of states as a whole. Kates 
also marshals impressive historical evidence that the Second Amendment, like 
other Bill of Rights protections, was intended to incorporate English common 
law rights of the time, which pretty clearly included the right to keep a gun 
in your home for reasons having nothing to do with the militia. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a good reply to Kates's fusillade, the controllers haven't made it. 
Of course the existence of an individual right to own guns doesn't mean that it 
is absolute. What are the limits? In the Supreme Court's one 20th-Century 
treatment of the Second Amendment, it held somewhat ambiguously in 1939 that 
sawed-off shotguns aren't necessarily protected by the Constitution without 
proof that they are the kind of weapon a militia might have used. 
</P>
<P>
Working from that decision and the common law, Kates says the amendment's 
protection should be limited to weapons "in common use among law-abiding 
people," useful for law enforcement or personal defense, and lineally descended 
from weapons known to the Framers. (No nuclear bombs.) He adds that they must 
be light enough for an ordinary person to carry ("bear"), and even that they 
can't be especially "dangerous or unusual." He says that the amendment places 
no limit on mandatory registration or laws against concealed weapons in public. 
</P>
<P>
This list seems quite reasonable and moderate, though where it all comes from 
is not clear. In suggesting, for example, that it would be fine to ban 
automatic rifles but not semi-automatics, Kates is slicing the constitutional 
salami pretty thin. But in what I suspect was the main purpose of his exercise 
-- establishing that a flat ban on handguns would be hard to justify under the 
Constitution -- Kates builds a distressingly good case. 
</P>
<P>
The downside of having a Bill of Rights is that the protection of individual 
rights usually entails social costs. This is as true of the Second Amendment as 
it is of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth. The downside of having those 
rights inscribed in a Constitution, protected from the whims of majority rule, 
is that they can't be re-defined as life changes. It would be remarkable indeed 
if none of the Bill of Rights became less sensible and more burdensome with 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Talking and writing are as central to American democracy as they ever were; 
shooting just isn't. Gun nuts are unconvincing (at least to me) in their 
attempts to argue that the individual right to bear arms is still as vital to 
freedom as it was in 1792. But the right is still there.

FUTURE SHOCK GETS OUT OF HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the amazing world events currently unfolding were a prize fight, the referee 
would probably stop it. History is throwing too much at us right now. Even the 
resilient Mikhail Gorbachev sometimes seems to reel from it all. People feel as 
if they're on the ropes, hoping that the bell will ring to bring each new round 
of action to a merciful end. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that German reunification may not be far off, and might even occur 
this year. Had anyone three months ago predicted a marriage of East and West 
Germany any time in the foreseeable future, he'd have been thought at best a 
hopeless German romantic. And now several Eastern European countries have 
either outlawed or declawed the Communist Party and Mother Russia has voted to 
deny the party its monopoly grip on power. What's next? Anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy to be a visionary these days. Meteorology seems a safer 
profession than political prognostication. It's true that the Albanian 
Communist Party is still hanging tough and Fidel Castro is still a true 
believer in communism and Catholics and Protestants are still killing each 
other in Northern Ireland. Some things, it seems, never change. But after what 
seems like centuries in a South African prison, Nelson Mandela is likely to be 
getting out soon, the armies of Europe aren't sure who the enemy is anymore and 
Tokyo, once the staunchest U.S. ally, is beginning to worry many Americans at 
least as much as Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
All change is inherently threatening, and a lot of change is very hard to take. 
Worse yet, hopes are so high about demilitarization in Europe and an end to the 
Cold War that there will be a tremendous collective emotional letdown if events 
reverse themselves and the world goes back to square one -- or returns to 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
But probably there's little we can do about any of this. Consider the debate 
now going on in Washington and Moscow as to whether to support German unity or 
to stick with the tried-and-true: a divided Germany that, after all, has helped 
keep the peace in Europe for 45 years. How much control do the superpowers 
really have over reunification? The truth is that history keeps on happening 
whether we like it or not. And apparently it's not going to slow down for 
anyone. It can put even superpowers in their place.

ROBBING THEM OF HOUSE AND HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 1,000 poor, elderly widows have lost their modest homes in 
South-Central Los Angeles recently to unscrupulous salesmen using a cynical 
scam. But a lawyers' group and a black church are working to put a stop to it, 
and they deserve considerable praise for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The scam works this way: Predators billing themselves as home-improvement 
salesmen go door-to-door in black neighborhoods. They target old women who live 
in homes purchased decades ago. The old houses -- which may have cost as little 
as $7,000 -- are worth 10 times that now, sometimes more, but need repairs. 
</P>
<P>
A new roof, a heating system, new carpeting or the like are tempting. The widow 
agrees and signs up for what she believes are small monthly payments. But there 
is trouble in the fine print. The papers -- actually a loan contract and 
mortgage -- require a large balloon payment at the end of one year, sometimes 
as much as $25,000. When the owner can't come up with the money, she loses her 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Bet Tzedek Legal Services -- a nonprofit law firm started 
originally to help elderly Jewish women -- have so far managed to save a dozen 
houses. But stopping foreclosure is difficult after the papers have been 
signed. So now they are trying to get the word out to elderly people in the 
community to be wary beforehand. And the lawyers have formed a Home Equity Task 
Force at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church to train volunteers to 
sound a warning: Don't sign anything without legal advice and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, the brainchild of Julius Butler, who belongs to the law firm 
and to the church, is contacting other congregations to spread the word. Los 
Angeles City Councilmen Bob Farrell, Gil Lindsay and Nate Holden have been 
asked to pitch in. The task force is also letting people know that help is 
available from the Los Angeles Department of Consumer Affairs. A telephone call 
to (213) 974-1452 can start the process of saving a home, if the owner is 
willing to complain. 
</P>
<P>
Too many elderly women have lost their houses to this scam already. A few may 
get restitution if either the city attorney or district attorney can 
successfully prosecute the salesmen and loan companies involved, but in many 
cases widows still lose their treasured homes. Here's hoping the Home Equity 
Task Force can put a stop to this scurrilous scam.

SOMETIMES WE HAVE SILLY TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is the picture in all of its Norman Rockwell glow: the sidewalk hot-dog 
stand, the earnest scrawl of the sign announcing a sale for the benefit of 
buying new school playground equipment. And there, standing next to the 
cowlicked, freckle-faced boy selling hot dogs, is the tax man, scooping up his 
percentage of the change. What's wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong is that this picture bears a remarkable likeness to what really 
happens under a foolish California tax law. The State Board of Equalization 
ruled recently that school organizations that sell food products as a means of 
raising money must pay sales tax. The ruling comes during a time when dwindling 
public resources have forced many extracurricular school activities, 
particularly athletics, to rely increasingly on fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey High in Monterey found itself in that position, with an athletic 
department budget that had dwindled from $12,000 in the late 1970s to less than 
$5,000 last year. But when the wrestling coach and team sold batches of fried 
calamari at the Monterey County Fair to augment the sports budget, they got 
slapped with a $1,000 tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
The automatic exemptions once enjoyed by school organizations were lost in the 
mid-1980s when the Legislature named many specific organizations, such as the 
Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and 4-H Clubs, as exempt. Other school organizations 
unknowingly lost their exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Equalization plans another hearing next month on the Monterey High 
case. In the meantime, Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-Castro Valley) is preparing 
needed legislation to clarify the muddled law. Current law could make a school 
organization's sales-tax status depend on whether the food sold was hot or 
cold, or whether it was sold at a county fair or a playground. 
</P>
<P>
School organizations trying to raise money for civic or charitable endeavors 
shouldn't have to split hairs -- or hot dog buns -- over taxes.

In response to "White-Knuckle Commuting" (Part A, Jan. 28), I commend you for 
printing the article to make the public more aware of how vulnerable 
motorcycles actually are on roads. It was also informative on the various 
statistics from several studies concerning helmet use and the need for rider 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The problem I have with the majority of Los Angeles publications is that they 
rarely look at the benefits of motorcycles: 
</P>
<P>
* They reduce traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
* Following the San Francisco earthquake, motorcycles were the only motorized 
vehicles that could move about freely, thus offering the only quick mode of 
ground transport. 
</P>
<P>
* They conserve a tremendous amount of fuel, thus saving resources for future 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
* They pollute far less of our air than any other form of motorized transport. 
</P>
<P>
* They provide tremendous time savings to the motorcycle commuter. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons I commute on a motorcycle are I save time and I enjoy riding.

THE GOOD LIFE IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are disappointed that David Farrell in his article, "Town That Tells Time on 
a Rolex" (Part A, Jan. 28), did not delve a little further into the reasons for 
the Beverly Hills teachers' strike in a community described as "a symbol of the 
finest in life, of quality and social refinement." 
</P>
<P>
Your readers might have been interested to know that two years ago the 
residents were asked to vote on a minimal parcel tax to maintain the 
educational standards and programs for the children and competitive teacher 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The measure requiring a two-thirds majority failed to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The $600,000 pledged by parents has to date only totaled $200,000. Each 
teacher, aide and classified employee will receive a 1% payment from the money 
this year. Class size has risen in the elementary and middle schools. Many 
teachers are struggling with 27 and 28 students in a room. We find it difficult 
to believe that this number is 10 fewer than similar classrooms in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to understand why a community which has a minimum welfare system, no 
hospital, let alone a museum, concert hall or sports arena, cannot afford to 
support its own school system about which it is so proud. 
</P>
<P>
A condominium owner may call the town a "fairyland" but unless she and the rest 
of the residents of Beverly Hills vote for the new parcel tax planned for the 
June 5 ballot, the present schoolchildren and future generations may have to 
come down to Earth and face the reality of a severely curtailed school system 
and its consequences.

If the shipyard at Long Beach were to be closed, it would be a strategic error. 
It will be the Navy and the Defense Department, not the many people who work 
there, that will suffer a tremendous loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has not lost money, but rather saved funds that would otherwise have 
been spent unnecessarily. Being the only naval shipyard on the West Coast, the 
Long Beach shipyard is of key importance to the Navy. If the shipyard were to 
be closed, the Navy would be forced to send its ships to civilian yards, thus 
adding to the cost of the upkeep of our Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Before conducting such rash actions as the shipyard closure, Secretary Cheney 
and Congress must carefully analyze the probable consequences that may result.

Why does this debate about a mandatory helmet law exist? Answer: the insurance 
industry (who else?). If the insurance people would get their act together and 
triple the medical premiums for those motorcyclists who choose not to wear a 
helmet (to reflect the much higher costs of an accident), I'm sure the cyclists 
would decide having the wind in your hair isn't that important after all.

ETHNIC CONFLICT IN EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I disagree with the observation by McManus. McManus states that nationalism is 
dangerous. On the contrary, I feel it is the healthiest omen experienced by not 
only the East Bloc countries but specifically the Soviet Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalism has always existed there in spite of the Russians' insistence on 
developing the robotic "Soviet Man" -- devoid of a heritage, history, culture, 
etc. This plot did not work as we can see. The underlying nationalism is being 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
I spent the last 1 1/2 years in the Soviet Union's non-Russian republics and 
what I saw and heard was truly positive. The people are full of hope -- maybe 
for the first time in 70 years. All their energies are being applied to 
throwing off the Russians once and for all -- and these were not the Baltic 
republics either.

Zbigniew Brzezinski may be perilously correct in declaring that ". . . the 
national and ethnic animosities in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union . . . 
could result in . . . geopolitical anarchy." Which is why we should be wary of 
naming Mikhail Gorbachev savior before the facts are all in. 
</P>
<P>
It could be that the turmoil his reforms are causing within the Communist world 
will result in civil war within the Soviet Union and -- who knows? -- nuclear 
war with others. When there are too many fingers on too many buttons . . .

I think that it is very difficult for Americans to comprehend the idea of 
nationalism. Our population is so diverse that the prevalent philosophy is one 
of un-nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
But when we look at events in other countries, there is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the attempt to "Sovietize" the population within the Soviet 
Union did not work. To understand why this was a failure, one has to thoroughly 
understand the individual histories of the 14 non-Russian countries -- not the 
Russian versions of these histories. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of the Soviet Union did not solve the territorial problems by 
examining the roots of these conflicts and offering solutions; imposition of 
the Soviet system was like placing a Band-Aid over a wound which needed more 
sophisticated treatment. 
</P>
<P>
With some loosening of this oppressive system, the smoldering fires of 
nationalism flared up once again. The "ghosts in the attic" are not dangerous 
ghosts. Nationalism is actually a very healthy state and people should be 
masters on their own territories. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the comments made by Alexiev, nationalism has always been on the 
forefront. It did not re-emerge suddenly with glasnost and perestroika.

The shameful story is a continuing record of waste by the previous 
Administration.

<P>
Imagine buying 52,000 of an item that the military uses a whole 4 a year! 
Meanwhile, this Administration has cut back on school lunches. Burbank High 
School, sorely in need of renovation for many years, lacks the money to do it. 
This list could go on and on. This disgraceful situation is just one of the 
many indignities suffered by the poor and the middle class these last few 
years. And yet the people who perpetrate these stupidities seem to escape, 
often to an affluent life. Where is the justice?

CSUN ENDS SLIDE WITH VICTORY OVER DOMINGUEZ HILLS 
</P>

<P>
After losing four consecutive games, the Cal State Northridge men's basketball 
team dodged a bullet to defeat Cal State Dominguez Hills, 56-52, in a 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game at Toro Gymnasium on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 52-51, with 1 minute 3 seconds to play, Northridge extended its 
advantage to three points on a pair of Kris Brodowski free throws. 
</P>
<P>
But the Matadors missed the front end of four consecutive one-and-one 
opportunities down the stretch to keep the Toros in the game. 
</P>
<P>
With 40 seconds left and Northridge leading, 54-51, Andre Henry missed a free 
throw. With 28 seconds to play, it was Derrick Gathers' turn, and, seven 
seconds later, Kendell McDaniels missed. 
</P>
<P>
After Raymond Bennett hit one of two free throws for the Toros, Gathers missed 
another foul shot with 10 seconds remaining, but McDaniels was there for the 
rebound and he fed Brodowski for the final basket. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very big win for us," said Brodowski, who scored 12 points and made 
eight of eight free throws. "We had played hard against Cal State L. A., but 
lost both games" 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels had a game-high 15 points for Northridge (10-12, 5-4 in conference 
play); Bennett scored 15 for Dominguez Hills (8-14, 4-5). 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 46-43, with 8:02 left, Northridge went on a 6-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniels started the rally with a 14-foot jump shot, and, after two missed 
shots on consecutive possessions, Gathers scored on a layup off a fast break, 
and McDaniels followed with a steal and a two-handed dunk. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in four games, Northridge shot better than 50% from the 
field (10 of 18) in the first half, but trailed, 24-23, at halftime as Robert 
Barksdale hit an 18-foot jump shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors took a 21-16 lead on Brodowski's basket with four minutes left in 
the half, but Dominguez Hills went on an 8-2 spurt before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Washington scored the first six points of the run and Barksdale capped 
it off with his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Washington scored 10 points (four of five from the field) in the first half and 
Bennett had five. 
</P>
<P>
Seven players scored for Northridge, led by McDaniels with seven.

CSUN LOSES HOME OPENER, 6-3

Tony Mortensen left a scholarship behind when he transferred from Division I 
power Fresno State to Cal State Stanislaus for his final season of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislaus, which moved from the Division III to the Division II level this 
season, does not award athletic grants. 
</P>
<P>
But Mortensen was happy to pay his own way. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to spend my senior year somewhere I would enjoy playing," Mortensen 
said. "It's turned out well so far." 
</P>
<P>
In his first start for Stanislaus -- and his first appearance since undergoing 
knee surgery in the spring of 1988 -- Mortensen pitched a complete game in the 
Warriors' 6-3 win over Northridge on Friday at Matador Field. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander from Rexburg, Ida., scattered six hits and struck out seven as 
Stanislaus shook off Thursday's 13-2 season-opening drubbing by Cal State Los 
Angeles and spoiled the Matadors' (2-3) home opener. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislaus collected 17 hits off starter Vale Lopez (1-1), who pitched 6 2/3 
innings, and reliever Todd Denhart. Shortstop Rich Ortega led the Warrior 
offense with three hits, including a fifth-inning triple that scored two runs 
and a solo home run in the ninth that sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Stanislaus took a 1-0 lead in the second on Tim Kassel's homer, but the 
Matadors came back with two runs in the third on a run-scoring double by Denny 
Vigo and a run-scoring single by Eric Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, however, regained the lead with a three-run fifth. Brad Roznovsky 
keyed the rally with a fly ball to left that Craig Clayton misplayed into a 
run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
"(That play) probably ended up being the difference," Northridge Coach Bill 
Kernen said.

CLEVELAND ALL BUSINESS IN 99-71 BLOWOUT

For the first time in anyone's memory, there was no chanting by the Cleveland 
High basketball team as it stormed from the locker room Friday, poised to take 
on Granada Hills in a game that would decide the North Valley League title. 
Subdued, or even intense, doesn't quite describe it. 
</P>
<P>
"A business-like attitude," said forward Brandon Martin, describing the tenor. 
"At Granada Hills, we were acting crazy in the hallway. Our minds weren't on 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Their minds have been on nothing else since. Two weeks ago, the Highlanders 
upset Cleveland, and reminders were everywhere Friday at Cleveland -- including 
one taped to the back of Eddie Hill's high-tops. 
</P>
<P>
"(Teammate) Kayheed Murray started the shoe thing," said Hill, who guaranteed 
that Cleveland would not fall in the rematch. "His said 'Terror Dome.' " 
</P>
<P>
And Hill's? The left shoe read "Revenge." Scrawled on the right, the final 
score from the first game, "88-82." 
</P>
<P>
And retribution it was, with the Cavaliers stomping Granada Hills, 99-71, to 
win their second consecutive North Valley title. The defeat snapped a 
seven-game winning streak by the Highlanders (17-8, 8-2 in league play), who 
entered the game ranked No. 1 in the Valley by The Times. Cleveland, ranked No. 
2, is 19-5, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
How soon did it end? Not when Cleveland stalked onto the floor for warm-ups, 
but it wasn't much later. Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson said that he felt it 
slipping away "in the second quarter." 
</P>
<P>
It might have started earlier. Cleveland trailed, 9-7, in the first quarter 
when Hill, who had been fouled while shooting by Osiris Nalls, wheeled and gave 
Nalls an earful -- earning a technical. "It was nothing, just the heat of the 
battle," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, heated to be sure. By the time the free throws were in the book, Granada 
Hills led, 10-9. Cleveland then went on a 49-27 tear to conclude the half. "I 
didn't do it purposely," Hill said. "But I guess it did give us a little 
boost." 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Collins, who relieved Hill, made two baskets and Martin -- who finished 
with 20 points on nine-of-14 shooting -- tossed in two more for a 23-20 lead 
after one quarter. The Cavaliers rolled up 35 points in the second quarter -- 
eight players scored -- to take a 58-37 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Five Cleveland players reached double figures: Hill (16), Pat McCook (13), 
Bobby McRae (11 points, 10 rebounds) and Murray (12). In the first three 
quarters, Cleveland made 31 of 57 field-goal attempts (54.4%) to 19 of 55 
(34.5%) for Granada Hills. Only Adrian Sellers, who scored 15 of his 19 points 
in the first half, and Jermoine Brantley (17 points) kept the Highlanders in 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they that good usually? I don't know how often they play that well," said 
Johnson, who smiled and added the following, an observation that area fans have 
come to know too well the past few years: "The thing is, they have the 
potential to do that every time. They're that good."

SAN FERNANDO CLINCHES TITLE IN WEST VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rightly or not, El Camino Real High felt it had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando, which wasn't supposed to falter, had plenty to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat us bad the first time and they're awfully good," said El Camino Real 
Coach Mike McNulty, explaining his team's carefree attitude Friday afternoon 
before the West Valley League finale between two playoff-bound teams. The 
Tigers had pounded the Conquistadores by 20 points in their first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But the winner of the game at San Fernando on Friday would be league champ and 
would take the better seeding into the playoffs next week. So whom to take? 
</P>
<P>
The favorite, of course: San Fernando (17-7, 7-3) emerged with a 67-61 win to 
give Coach Dick Crowell his second league title in three years and secure a 
date with Marshall in the first round of the playoffs. El Camino Real (9-10, 
6-4) finished in second place and will face East Valley League champion Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Simple? Not really. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando used its decided height and weight advantages inside -- Russell 
Baldwin (team-high 17 points) and 6-foot-8, 250-pound Lance Whitaker (16 
points) -- to hammer out a cushy 57-42 lead with 40 seconds remaining in the 
third quarter. Then a funny thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
Conquistadore guard Todd Orlando (game-high 20 points) drilled five three-point 
shots in the second half, the Tigers played as if sedated, and suddenly the 
scoreboard read 61-59, San Fernando, with just 3 minutes 55 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real effectively used substitutes Al Chow and Danny Costa and starter 
Brent Goldberg during its magical 14-2 run in the fourth quarter. Then it shot 
itself in the foot, however, by missing four consecutive free throws.

Palmdale (15-10, 7-3 in league play), which clinched a tie for second place 
with Canyon, spent the game in the paint, capitalizing on the Antelopes' lack 
of depth. 
</P>
<P>
Three players -- center Chris DeGlopper (16 points, seven rebounds), forward 
Jason Grimes (14 points, 11 rebounds) and guard John Johnson (10 points, 10 
rebounds) -- penetrated Antelope Valley's defense effectively. 
</P>
<P>
With forward Jabbar Briggs ruled academically ineligible earlier this week and 
four reserves who served nearly a season-long suspension from school for an 
on-campus incident in December now academically ineligible as well, the 
Antelopes (20-5, 8-2) were short on horsepower to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the problem, center John Pletsch scored no points and fouled out in 
the fourth quarter. Guard B. J. Petersen did not score until sinking a 
three-point shot in the final minute. And only four players scored. 
</P>
<P>
Left to carry the load for the Antelopes were forward Chris Walters, who scored 
15 points, and guard Bobby Paiz, who scored a game-high 17 points, including 
five three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
A rather ominous season-ending performance, Antelope Valley Coach Skip Adams 
conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really sure, but we gotta do something," Adams said. "But I'm going to 
try and not get overly concerned because we had a bad shooting night." 
</P>
<P>
The Antelopes made only 17 of 54 (31.2%) shots from the field and missed their 
first seven before Walters made a driving layup with 2:30 to play in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Palmdale led, 10-0, and never trailed thereafter. The Antelopes 
made just two of 13 shots in the first quarter and only seven of 26 in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, who made two three-pointers, did not score in the fourth quarter. 
Johnson, who proudly announced that the win was his first over Antelope Valley 
in his three-year career, shadowed Walters effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talks about how great Chris Walters is," Johnson said. "I feel I did 
a pretty good job." VINCE KOWALICK

Thousand Oaks 65, Newbury Park 58 -- Thousand Oaks' Chris Loll hit two 
three-point shots and Tony Siegel made a third to pace a 21-7 run in the 
pivotal second quarter of a Marmonte League finale. The win, and Westake's loss 
to Channel Islands, forced a three-way tie for third place among the Lancers

FACES . . . : EMOTIONAL RESCUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend of David Carlson's died, unexpectedly, on her 34th birthday. "I was so 
grief stricken, I went home and started to write," the composer recalls. "It 
was an emotional necessity." Two weeks later, he had finished "Rhapsodies." 
</P>
<P>
"In that sense, it is a Requiem. Only, it doesn't sound like one," says 
Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson, who grew up in Altadena, was trained at CalArts, and has lived in San 
Francisco for 13 years, returns to his roots this week, when the San Francisco 
Symphony, on tour with its music director, Herbert Blomstedt, plays 
"Rhapsodies" at three of its five Southern California performances. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, Monday 
night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Music Center, and Thursday in 
Santa Barbara, "Rhapsodies" will be the first of Carlson's works to be heard 
publicly in the area where he grew up. But he is no late-bloomer; at 37, he has 
been writing music for the best part of three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I was 10, I had a real interest in becoming a composer, and had 
bought the paper, even though I hadn't developed the skills. 
</P>
<P>
"As a teen-ager, I wrote gigantic, 30-minute piano sonatas in the style of 
Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev." It took him a long time to find his own voice, 
Carlson confesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Around 1979, after having tried many different approaches, my own style began 
to emerge, in my cello concerto. Looking back, I see that was a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson was still relatively unknown when a friend took a tape of one of 
Carlson's works to Charles Wuorinen, new-music adviser to the San Francisco 
Symphony. Wuorinen subsequently programmed "Rhapsodies" on the orchestra's New 
and Unusual series. Since then, the 14-minute work has reached a number of 
symphonic venues around the country. DANIEL CARIAGA

HELMS' LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parachini's article creates a misimpression by suggesting that Sen. Helms 
supported me for NEA general counsel in order to extend his influence over the 
NEA. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Helms' Nov. 24, 1989 letter indicated that on the advice of a trusted 
friend he had reason to believe I would make an excellent general counsel, and 
it suggested that the NEA chairman meet with me and make his own assessment. 
</P>
<P>
This mild and indirect support of my candidacy can hardly qualify as the 
exercise of undue influence over the NEA. Furthermore, the letter had no 
bearing on obtaining an interview with NEA Chairman Frohnmayer, since I had an 
interview with him on Nov. 6, i.e. before the letter was received. 
</P>
<P>
It should also be noted that my candidacy was supported by Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy. I am grateful for the support of both Sen. Helms and Sen. Kennedy that 
hopefully indicated to the chairman that I had the ability to work effectively 
with persons of radically different political persuasions.

It was great to read that someone in the media could see through Geraldo 
Rivera's continuing witch hunt regarding the McMartin trial. Could you sense 
where the show was headed when Rivera started off with: "What went wrong with 
the McMartin trial?" 
</P>
<P>
Nothing went wrong with the McMartin trial, except for the judge not demanding 
that the jurors keep their mouths shut afterward.

(TA'YER) OPENS HIGHWAYS FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH ZIMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The multicultural performance collective, (Ta'yer), opened Highways' 
2-month-long Sex, God &amp; Politics Performance Festival on Thursday evening 
with a program called "Love and Revenge." Composed of artists whose levels of 
competence vary widely, the event seesaws between the naive and the 
sophisticated, with honors for charm and talent going to Betty Gonzales Nash 
and Luis Alfaro. 
</P>
<P>
Nash, a fiery actress/dancer, co-wrote and performed with Alfaro a funny, 
touching exploration of how gender and role expectations interfere with genuine 
expressions of love. Both begin the piece in identical gorgeously pleated, 
black-and-red costumes, later shed to reveal a black lace dress on Alfaro and 
toreador drag on Nash. Titled "Relationships," the writing of the piece lacks 
specificity, but the performances are remarkable in their complexity and range. 
</P>
<P>
The yoke between sex and politics was firmly established decades ago in the 
revolutions of the '60s. Thus Mary Ann Tamaki's preachy, treacle-sweet "What 
Time Is It?" proved an anachronistic embarrassment. She distributes sprays of 
flowers to audience members, urging them to become the "we generation," as a 
home movie of downtown street life flickers on the wall behind her. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran guitarist Luis Lopez plays and sings Latin American love songs for 
"a time of war" in his appealing fusion style. Colombian architect/writer 
Fernando D. Castro offers "Mark's Poem," a baffling exercise about sex, drugs 
and violence in a gay Latino community. Here, too, Alfaro's sequinned presence 
is a treat, though his role is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
The program, to be repeated tonight and Thursday, Friday and Saturday, closes 
with "Valentine Confessions," aggressively amateur, by ensemble members.

BEALE ST. PORTRAIT WITHOUT THE MUSIC IN 'ALL NIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"All Day and All Night," airing Sunday at 11 p.m. on KCET Channel 28, is just 
about half the show it should be -- literally. Presented under the auspices of 
the Center for Southern Folklore, this 30-minute cross-section of Beale Street 
in Memphis could have made an absorbing one-hour program, with more music to 
flesh out the already ample and richly anecdotal talk. 
</P>
<P>
The central point of interest is the life style of musicians who lived in 
Memphis in the first half of this century. According to the interlocutors who 
reminisce about Beale Street, this was the throbbing counterpart of Basin 
Street in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
B. B. King, who from 1950 to 1953 had his own series on the pioneer 
black-oriented radio station WDIA in Memphis, sings a couple of numbers but is 
presented primarily as the main speaker, recalling with wry humor the days 
when, unemployed and broke, he would win a $1 prize in a local amateur night 
show. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Dwight (Gatemouth) Moore recalls affectionately his youthful 
blues-singing days. Rufus Thomas, a few years Moore's junior and one of his 
most ardent disciples, speaks eloquently: "If you were black for one Saturday 
night and went to Beale Street, you'd never want to be white again." 
</P>
<P>
The camaraderie and creative spirit that pervaded Beale Street in those days is 
no doubt colored by the warming flow of nostalgia, yet much of it seems real 
and convincing. If only there had been more than those brief minutes of actual 
performance, the value of "All Day and All Night" would have been as compelling 
as the impact of the conversation. LEONARD FEATHER

'MIRACLE LANDING': A DOCU THAT COULD USE MORE DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first crack in the ceiling of the passenger liner comes 30 minutes into 
"Miracle Landing" (Sunday at 9 p.m., Channels 2 and 8). Nothing remotely 
gripping happens up to that point. It's a long time to wait. But to paraphrase 
a famous actress, fasten your seat belts -- it's going to be a bumpy ride. 
</P>
<P>
Another TV movie wrenched from a true-life story, "Miracle Landing" is the saga 
of the Hawaiian airliner that lost a 20-foot section of its fuselage on an 
inter-island hop two years ago. Since we know that the plane landed safely and 
that no one was blown through the gaping hole in the roof of the plane, there's 
no suspense -- unless you like watching a lot of decompression and people's 
hair getting blown around in the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
The ordeal of the crew and the 94 passengers on that unforgettable flight, 
which finally skidded onto a landing strip in Maui like an open-air 
convertible, is not necessarily the stuff of a good action picture. It's up to 
the film makers to keep us interested. They don't. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with Wayne Rogers' dull but resolute pilot, there's little 
characterization developed in Garner Simmons' formula teleplay. Here's a case 
where doses of docudrama license would have improved the production. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, while the wind machine works overtime, the special effects fail to 
visually exploit that big jagged, cutaway section ripped out of the plane. One 
wind-blown head after another doesn't make a movie. 
</P>
<P>
But heroism, as it unfolded in the actual incident, abounds in the case of a 
flight attendant (nicely played by Ana-Alicia) who rises to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
For aviation buffs, the flight procedures in the cabin as the plane is 
splitting apart from "metal fatigue" were shot with the guidance of the real 
crew (notably pilot Bob Schornstheimer). Dick Lowry directed. RAY LOYND

As Alaska crude oil continues to taint the beaches in Southern California this 
weekend, "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" tonight offers a re-creation of 
that other oil spill -- the 11 million gallons dumped in Prince William Sound, 
Alaska by the Exxon Valdez last March. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS report (at 10 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8) comes while Joseph Hazelwood, 
the captain of the Valdez, is being tried in Anchorage on charges of reckless 
endangerment, criminal mischief and negligent discharge of oil. 
</P>
<P>
But the program focuses primarily on the failure of the state, the Coast Guard 
and the oil company to contain and clean up the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, "Elvis," ABC's new series that chronicles the early life of perhaps 
the world's most famous pop star, premieres in its regular time slot at 8:30 
p.m. Sunday (7)(3)(10)(42). 
</P>
<P>
"Blind Faith," based on Joe McGinniss' book about a husband suspected of 
arranging his wife's murder, begins Sunday at 9 p.m. (4)(36)(39). The two-part 
saga, starting Robert Urich and Joanna Kerns, concludes Tuesday at 9 p.m. STEVE

The Bush Administration has completed a drug summit agreement with three South 
American countries, committing the United States to economic and military aid 
to counteract the Latin nations' economic reliance on drugs, an official said. 
In addition to the $423-million anti-drug package President Bush is proposing 
for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, the Administration will pledge to help track 
illegal export of U.S.-produced firearms and crack down on drug-related 
chemical exports.

In a major step toward ending the 10-month strike by United Mine Workers of 
America against Pittston Coal, the National Labor Relations Board said it 
settled all outstanding charges in the sometimes violent contract dispute. 
Union President Richard Trumka said the action takes the union "one step 
closer" to voting on contract terms. It also sets up a showdown Monday in the 
coal fields of southwest Virginia, where a county judge must decide whether to 
set aside $64 million in fines levied against the union for civil disobedience 
during the strike.

Gov. George Deukmejian has asked the 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento 
to reconsider its January ruling that would give journalists and others access 
to the governor's daily appointment calendars. The request for a rehearing 
argues that the court erred last month when it granted a Los Angeles Times 
reporter access to documents listing the people that Deukmejian has met with on 
official business since he became governor in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Records Act generally requires officials to make 
documents available unless there is a strong public interest in not disclosing 
them. But Deukmejian contended that the calendars are covered by an exemption 
in the law that allows the governor to withhold his "correspondence" -- which 
he defined as "interchange of written communications." The Appellate Court 
disagreed, saying that the definition used by Deukmejian would allow him to 
withhold "virtually every written item in the governor's office."

Legislators raised $24.4 million last year for their reelection campaigns, 
marking the first time in memory the flow of money into lawmakers' war chests 
has slowed, California Common Cause reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The figure, culled from campaign reports submitted to the secretary of state, 
is 13% lower than in 1987, the last year in which there was no election. The 
1989 figure compares to $27.4 million in 1987, the all-time high for off-year 
fund-raising. Most campaign funds are raised during election years. Common 
Cause spokeswomen were reluctant to credit the decrease to Proposition 73, a 
1988 ballot measure that overhauled the state's campaign finance laws. Among 
other things, Proposition 73 set limits on contributions for the first time.

MISSILE SYSTEMS MAY FACE AX, NUNN WARNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. Sam Nunn, the leading Democratic voice on military issues, warned Friday 
that Congress may kill one or perhaps both of the nation's proposed mobile 
missile systems if President Bush does not significantly change his position in 
strategic arms talks with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Secretary of State James A. Baker III negotiated arms issues in Moscow, 
the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman asserted that Bush is "out of 
sync" with a drastically diminished threat from the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
In a breakfast session with Times editors and reporters, the Georgia senator 
urged that Bush propose abandoning the MX rail-mobile missile -- a major pillar 
of a modernized U.S. nuclear defense -- in exchange for having the Soviets 
scrap their similar SS-24 system. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Administration is pushing for mobile deployment of both the 
multiple-warhead MX and the single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn also predicted a substantial reduction in the production of the B-2 
Stealth bomber, projected to cost $68 billion if all 132 planes are produced as 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks buttressed growing Democratic criticism of Administration policy at 
a crucial new stage in superpower maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) accused Bush 
of "beating plowshares into swords," while Nunn's House counterpart, Rep. Les 
Aspin (D-Wis.), called on the President to allow his arms-control positions to 
conform to "the new reality." 
</P>
<P>
The attacks presage major battles in Congress this year over reshaping the 
nation's military and forging a new U.S.-Soviet relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn criticized a Bush trip this week in which the President viewed war games 
between U.S. and "Soviet" forces in Barstow, Calif., checked on "Star Wars" 
missile-defense research in Livermore, Calif., and took a look at Strategic Air 
Command operations in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
"This high-visibility-type trip to places where they're actually having war 
games -- with all the developments in Eastern Europe, with all the testimony 
we've had about reduced threat -- is just out of sync," he said. "It just 
doesn't fit in with world events." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the senator assailed the President's stance in talks with the Soviets 
on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe if President Bush does not change our present START position . . . 
then we're going to have deep, deep trouble on the strategic programs in the 
Congress this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn estimated that the MX and Midgetman programs have only a 50-50 chance of 
survival in the current situation -- especially with Congress looking to trim 
up to $15 billion from the Bush Administration's $303.3-billion defense request 
for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
However, the senator said, he will take steps to try to avoid such a drastic 
outcome. If Bush fails to make changes soon, Nunn will press Congress to 
legislate a new START position on its own, which would at least temporarily 
preserve both the MX and Midgetman. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the best way to do business," he conceded. "When people say 
Congress shouldn't be legislating arms control, I generally agree with that." 
</P>
<P>
What if Bush continues to stand firm on START and Nunn is unable to push his 
own proposal through Congress? Then, Nunn predicted, both the $6-billion MX and 
$30-billion Midgetman programs could be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know which one will get killed or whether possibly both of them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Nunn's START plan, the United States would trade away the MX and develop 
the Midgetman -- a course believed to be privately supported by Bush's national 
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. However, Scowcroft is in an uphill fight 
with Defense and State department officials on that issue, Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The senator suggested that the State Department is pressuring Bush to stick 
with his START position so that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
can sign an agreement at a summit meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
"If it takes us six more months to negotiate START, my goodness, with all the 
world events, the two leaders have plenty to talk about without START," Nunn 
declared. "Let's get a good agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said he wants Bush to propose to the Soviets that both sides agree to 
scrap all land-based missiles armed with multiple warheads within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
As a first step, the Soviets would dispense with their rail-mobile SS-24s and 
the United States would drop plans to take its MXs out of silos and put them on 
rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the United States would gradually replace the MXs it has in silos with 
single-warhead Midgetman missiles. Later, the United States could transfer the 
Midgetman onto trucks if its submarine-launched missiles ran into problems. 
Meanwhile, the Soviets could continue deploying their truck-mounted, 
single-warhead SS-25. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn argued that his plan would be more stabilizing than Bush's, reducing the 
vulnerability of each side's missiles and, therefore, lessening the temptation 
to launch a preemptive strike. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush adopted the Nunn plan, the senator predicted that "Congress would go 
along with some kind of contingency funding of the MX rail mobile until the 
Soviets agreed to make the trade" on the SS-24. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Nunn added, he would favor granting all $2.8 billion that Bush 
requested for the MX in fiscal 1991. "Then I would have a private conversation 
with him and say, 'Mr. President, tell them over in the Pentagon not to spend 
it very quickly.' Then we make a deal" with the Soviets, disposing of both the 
MX and SS-24. "Then you've got a concept that makes sense," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Major reductions in land-based missiles, the senator added, would increase the 
need for the radar-evading, deep-penetrating B-2 bomber developed by Northrop 
Corp. in California. But while Nunn said he still strongly supports the 
program, he predicted that production would be limited to "substantially less" 
than the 132 projected. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about indications that Rep. Aspin would support funding only 17 more B-2s 
beyond the 13 in the pipeline, Nunn said: "That's pretty low from my point of 
view. . . . It depends on their cost. . . . If the B-2 is going to be funded by 
the Congress, the Air Force is going to have to get the price tag down." 
</P>
<P>
Proposed START rules for counting nuclear warheads favor bombers, he noted, so 
the question is what kind of bomber force the United States will have. He said 
the existing B-1, which he opposed, needs expensive refurbishing to improve its 
performance. Also, production lines for tankers to refuel the B-1 would have to 
be restarted if the B-2 is canceled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to get a lot less capable B-1 than you would have B-2 at about 
the same cost," Nunn argued. 
</P>
<P>
The senator supported Bush's latest proposal for reducing U.S. and Soviet troop 
levels in Europe. That called for each side to come down to 195,000 in Central 
Europe, with the United States permitted to keep an additional 30,000 in other 
parts of the continent.

MOORING MASTER TELLS REGRET, DENIES BLAME

John Keon, the mooring master who supervised the ill-fated berthing of the 
American Trader off Huntington Beach, said Friday night that he feels badly 
about the oil spill but that he is not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives are tied to the sea," said Keon, 41, in his first interview since 
the accident. "We care just as much about the birds and the fish and everything 
else, the pollution, as anybody. I see those people on the beach and I hope 
they know that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any accident or incident on my record, and after this 
investigation is done that will be the same," Keon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously something happened out there. There's a ship with at least one hole 
in it and a pollution incident. Beyond that I can't say any more." 
</P>
<P>
Keon spoke at his home after returning for the first time since the Wednesday 
afternoon oil spill. He said he had been awake, talking to Coast Guard 
officials since the accident. 
</P>
<P>
He said crew members at first were baffled by the oil leak. "They knew on the 
ship that there was oil on the water. They saw it and smelled it. But nobody 
knew what caused it for a few hours until the divers went down and discovered a 
hole." 
</P>
<P>
The tanker's 12-ton anchor had gashed a hole in the hull during a routine 
mooring maneuver. Keon said he has guided between 75 and 100 moorings at the 
Huntington Beach terminal, and there was nothing different about the situation 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no low tide," Keon said, disputing official reports. "The tide was 
normal. There was nothing unusual about the conditions at all. All the moorings 
on the West Coast are virtually the same. There is nothing particularly 
difficult about this one." 
</P>
<P>
But Keon, speaking with his wife Karen and daughter Heather nearby, said he was 
under orders not to offer any more details. 
</P>
<P>
He said the environmental damage was upsetting to everyone aboard the ship. 
</P>
<P>
Keon, a burly man with sandy hair and full beard, looks the part of a seaman. 
He has worked on ships for 24 years since starting as an ordinary seaman. He 
has been a self-employed mooring master at Huntington Beach for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The American Trader's captain, A. R. (Robert) La Ware, was also on board at the 
time of the accident. But it is typical for an experienced local pilot to guide 
the berthing with help from a mooring launch on the water. 
</P>
<P>
Both Keon and La Ware were tested for drugs and alcohol after the accident. The 
alcohol results were negative and the drug tests are pending. A friend said 
Keon is a teetotaler. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 gallons of Alaskan crude oil poured from the tanker's hull and 
some of the crude has washed onto a 12-mile stretch of Orange County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker berthing process is laborious, often taking two to three hours. The 
large ship must be turned and nudged into position between a cluster of buoys 
that hold it in position. The ship is then connected to a pipeline that carries 
the crude oil to refineries onshore. 
</P>
<P>
Keon and his family have lived in the San Jacinto area for eight years. They 
own a tan, stucco house with a red-tile roof on Inglenook Avenue, a quiet 
cul-de-sac in an upscale subdivision. He and his wife grew up in the Garden 
Grove-Westminster area of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The mooring master praised the tanker crew's efforts to quickly contain the 
damage. "The vessel captain notified the Coast Guard and all the pertinent 
authorities right away," Keon said. "They were on the scene quickly. The 
response was excellent."

REAGAN AGREES TO VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY IN POINDEXTER TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>

WILL BE QUESTIONED UNDER OATH AS A DEFENSE WITNESS.

<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, forgoing his right to claim executive 
privilege, agreed Friday to testify on videotape as a defense witness in John 
M. Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan will be questioned under oath by Poindexter's lawyers and cross-examined 
by the Iran-Contra special counsel during the taping. Although Reagan 
previously provided information about the scandal that broke out during his 
second term, the videotaped testimony will be the closest he has come to the 
give-and-take of a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
In a four-page brief filed with U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, Reagan's 
lawyers said the use of videotape -- instead of live testimony in the courtroom 
-- would permit the former President to respond to questions without running 
the risk of inadvertently disclosing sensitive national secrets. If such 
secrets were mentioned, they would be deleted from the tape. 
</P>
<P>
The brief said Reagan "recognizes that the videotape deposition format will 
provide an appropriate mechanism for all parties, including the incumbent and 
former presidents, to protect sensitive, classified national security 
information and confidential deliberations." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's attorney, Theodore B. Olson, said the former President "will not 
assert executive privilege" with respect to the videotaped testimony. He added 
that Reagan would defer to President Bush and the Justice Department "with 
respect to issues of executive privilege concerning national security or 
foreign affairs that may arise during the taking of the videotaped deposition." 
</P>
<P>
Greene ruled earlier that either Reagan or Bush could claim executive 
privilege. Reagan has already claimed executive privilege to avoid turning over 
excerpts from his diaries; that issue remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief submitted late Friday, the Justice Department concurred somewhat 
reluctantly with Reagan's decision regarding the videotaping. 
</P>
<P>
"The current Administration . . . hereby also notifies the court that, like the 
former President, it waives that aspect of the executive privilege which would 
otherwise excuse President Reagan from submitting to such a deposition," the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the questions (Poindexter) proposes to ask former President Reagan fit 
squarely within the area protected by executive privilege," the department 
added. "They seek to inquire into foreign policy deliberations within the 
President's office. Accordingly, the privilege could be claimed as to these 
lines of inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
However, the department said it decided against invoking privilege at this 
point, although it reserved the right to do so during the taping if sensitive 
matters are raised. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan suggested that the taping be done next Friday in his office in Los 
Angeles. The Justice Department supported that date. After receiving the former 
President's brief, Greene issued a one-sentence order setting a hearing for 11 
a.m. Monday to approve the ground-rules for the session. 
</P>
<P>
"Former President Reagan recognizes that this court has a considerable 
responsibility to protect and preserve the rights of the defendant in this case 
as well as to be sensitive to the interests of the former President and the 
constitutional rights and duties of the presidency," Olson added. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier order, Greene said he would preside over the former President's 
testimony, ruling on objections raised by lawyers from either side. 
Specifically, the judge said he would consider claims of executive privilege or 
national security that might be raised as the taping goes along. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also limited Poindexter's lawyers to 154 specific questions which 
they submitted in advance. Although lawyers will be allowed to ask follow-up 
questions, they will not be permitted to introduce additional subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department said that seven of the 154 questions "delve into the 
nature of various communications between former President Reagan and foreign 
heads of state, which are, to our knowledge, still undisclosed and sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the department said that none of the questions, including the 
seven, "pose serious problems" as phrased by Poindexter's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"However, follow-up questions could lead into sensitive areas, including 
foreign relations matters, that are still protected . . . thus it is possible a 
specific follow-up question may raise an issue of privilege." 
</P>
<P>
Greene reserved the right to edit the tape to eliminate matters which should 
not be disclosed. The tape would be kept secret until it was played during 
Poindexter's trial, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to his agreement to give oral testimony, Reagan earlier this week 
invoked executive privilege in an effort to avoid turning over to Poindexter's 
lawyers more than 30 excerpts from his White House diaries. Greene has said he 
will hold a hearing to determine whether Reagan's claim of constitutionally 
guaranteed confidentiality outweighs Poindexter's need for evidence to defend 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser, is charged with five 
felony counts of obstructing Congress, making false statements and conspiracy. 
He apparently is seeking to show that he was acting with presidential approval, 
although Reagan has denied that. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan was interviewed by the Tower Commission, which first investigated secret 
arms sales to Iran and the diversion of some of the profits to the Contra 
rebels in Nicaragua. Later, Reagan supplied written answers to questions 
submitted by the Iran-Contra grand jury. Excerpts from Reagan's diaries were 
given to the congressional Iran-Contra committees, but the papers were never 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's two immediate predecessors -- Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter -- both 
provided videotaped testimony while in office. Ford testified as a defense 
witness in 1975 in the trial of Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme, who was convicted of 
trying to assassinate him. 
</P>
<P>
Carter gave taped testimony twice. Once he was a government witness in the 
perjury and gambling trial of a Georgia state senator. Later, he testified 
before a federal grand jury investigating allegations that fugitive financier 
Robert Vesco tried to bribe officials of the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although no President or former President has ever been forced to testify in 
open court against his will, the courts have held as far back as 1807 that a 
President has an obligation to provide evidence in trials.

SANDINISTAS FREE 1,190 IMPRISONED FOR POLITICS; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: SOME VIEW THE MOVE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS A 
PLOY TO WIN VOTES FOR ORTEGA.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weeks before national elections, the Sandinista government on Friday freed 
1,190 Contras, rebel collaborators and former National Guardsmen in a prison 
yard ceremony that officials said emptied Nicaraguan jails of all political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 39 National Guardsmen released were allegedly some of the most brutal 
officers from the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, who was deposed by a 
Sandinista-led insurrection in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials charged, for instance, that when Col. Isaias Cuadra served 
as director of the Tipitapa Penitentiary under Somoza, he tortured at least one 
prominent prisoner -- Sandinista Cmdr. Tomas Borge. Since the Sandinistas came 
to power, Borge has served as interior minister, overseeing the prisons, and 
Cuadra has spent 10 1/2 years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I have suffered a great deal during these years I have spent in prison," 
Cuadra, 56, said on his release. "I have come to understand human beings. I 
understand there are passions, there is pain and that anyone who is a Christian 
has to know how to forgive." 
</P>
<P>
But he denied having tortured anyone, although reports of torture under Somoza 
were common. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega, who also spent time in jail for being a Sandinista 
guerrilla, had announced the release last month as a gesture to reunite this 
country, which has been divided first by the Sandinista revolution and then by 
the U.S.-backed Contra war. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Central American peace accords signed by the region's five 
presidents, the Sandinistas are required to pardon and release political 
prisoners. But Ortega is seeking reelection Feb. 25 as the Sandinista National 
Liberation Front's candidate for peace and reconciliation, and the release is 
seen by many as a campaign maneuver to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. Franco Montealegre, head of prisons, read the release decree as the 
convicts stood in single file on the prison yard's concrete basketball courts. 
Diplomats, members of the media and international observers here to monitor the 
elections watched the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government must respond to this decree by stopping its support for 
warlike options and by giving determined support to the peace process," the 
decree stated. 
</P>
<P>
Four former Contra commanders who have come back to Nicaragua to observe the 
elections also attended the ceremony. When Montealegre greeted them during his 
introduction, the prisoners broke into applause. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Contras and guardsmen interviewed after receiving their release 
papers said they hope to move to the United States, where most of their 
relatives live. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing for me here," said former National Guard Capt. Orlando Hislop 
Mercado, 45. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista officials accuse Hislop of having raped and tortured Cmdr. Doris 
Tijerino during her imprisonment as a guerrilla. Now, Tijerino is head of the 
Sandinista police. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been accused of everything you can imagine. My release order says 
'atrocious assassination.' I heard on the radio the other day that I had raped 
a commander. I don't even know all they accuse me of, but . . . all the 
accusations are false," Hislop said. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the released former guardsmen was Maj. Jose Enrique Munguia Berrios. 
He allegedly led the patrol that killed Sandinista hero Carlos Fonseca in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought people who were armed just like me. I could have been killed just as 
easily as them," Munguia said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The number of political prisoners in Nicaragua has always been widely disputed 
and remained so Friday. Sandinista officials said that only common criminals 
and Sandinista soldiers accused of abuses remain in jail now.

MANDELA, 22 ACTIVISTS DISCUSS STRATEGY AT PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: HE TELLS VISITORS THAT HE IS READY TO BE FREED AND THAT HE HAS 
SET NO PRECONDITIONS.

<P>
Black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela and 22 leading anti-apartheid activists 
discussed political strategy in a 5 1/2-hour session in his prison home near 
here Friday, with participants quoting Mandela as saying he was optimistic that 
the problems facing South Africa can be resolved peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
But, in Johannesburg, a peaceful demonstration to celebrate President Frederik 
W. de Klerk's week-old steps to open up political expression was marred when 
police set upon activists departing the rally and beat some repeatedly with 
batons. 
</P>
<P>
The activists, dancing and singing liberation songs, were emerging from St. 
Mary's Anglican Church onto downtown streets following a lunchtime service 
beneath a church banner that read "Let justice roll down like waters." Police 
gave them two minutes to disperse and then moved in, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Mandela at Victor Verster prison farm reflected the unusual 
dialogue that the imprisoned leader is conducting with black leaders and the 
government behind prison walls. 
</P>
<P>
"He appears to be in total control" of his discussions with the government, 
said one of the delegates, Dullah Omar, a Mandela family lawyer and 
anti-apartheid leader. But, the delegates said, the date of his release remains 
in the hands of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has served more than 27 years of a life term for sabotage, told 
his visitors he stands ready to be released immediately and has set no 
preconditions. But Mandela added that in discussions with De Klerk and other 
government officials he has made it clear that his preconditions for 
negotiations with the white minority-led government remain the same as those of 
the African National Congress, the primary guerrilla group fighting Pretoria. 
Among those conditions is a complete lifting of the 3 1/2-year state of 
emergency and freedom for all prisoners convicted of politically motivated 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
And, Mandela said that once he is released he will "never obey any apartheid 
laws," according to Omar. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest delegation Mandela has yet received at the sprawling, 
three-bedroom home he occupies at the prison, and the visitors included most of 
the national leaders of the 2-million-member United Democratic Front 
anti-apartheid coalition, which is closely aligned with the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of the new era that De Klerk has opened in South Africa came on 
state-run television Friday night, when South Africans saw an unedited 
rebroadcast of ABC-TV's "Nightline" program featuring ANC foreign affairs chief 
Thabo Mbeki, South African Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, and moderate 
Zulu leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first opportunity for most South Africans, both white and black, to 
see and hear a leading ANC official since the organization was banned in 1960. 
De Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and about 60 other anti-apartheid groups 
last week and removed ANC leaders' names from the list of people who cannot be 
seen or quoted in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In the broadcast, which was shown in the United States on Thursday night, Botha 
acknowledged that the government should have begun talking with the ANC years 
ago. Mbeki said the ANC welcomes De Klerk's new reform initiatives but said the 
president has to take more steps before the ANC will call off its campaign to 
encourage international sanctions against Pretoria and enter into negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the ANC has refused to engage in any talks with the government, 
although Mandela has been acting as a facilitator between the two parties by 
setting out the ANC's stand in meetings with government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, De Klerk defended his reforms to Parliament on Friday, saying he is 
trying to create a climate in which black leaders will come to the table to 
discuss power-sharing in a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
He accused his right-wing opponents of trying to stir up racial animosity in 
the country. The pro-apartheid Conservative Party has criticized De Klerk, 
saying he is giving in to the 27 million black majority, and it has threatened 
boycotts and protest strikes to force him to call a new election before his 
5-year term expires. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his ruling National Party "talks renewal and courage, and they 
(the Conservatives) talk racism and aggression." 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives, who won 31% of the vote in last September's elections, "will 
plunge this country into a racial war," De Klerk told Parliament. But, he 
added, the government "will not allow anyone or any party to set fire to this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has said he wants to bring blacks into the national government within 
five years, but he opposes a one-man, one-vote system, which is the basic 
demand of all leading anti-apartheid groups. 
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Front on Friday gave Mandela a new policy document that 
conditionally supports negotiations with the government. But the UDF document 
also calls for multiracial elections for a constituent assembly to draw up a 
new constitution, an idea that De Klerk has rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The president's reform moves have been hampered in recent days as police have 
used force to disperse several peaceful protests. De Klerk has said he will 
permit peaceful protest if permission is obtained from the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid groups have welcomed his initiatives, including the lifting of 
restrictions on several hundred political activists and a partial rescinding of 
the state of emergency. But they are demanding more. 
</P>
<P>
During Friday's rally in Johannesburg, the Rev. Godfrey Henhood told about 
1,000 people packed into St. Mary's that "a major breakthrough has been 
achieved. But the struggle is not over. There is much to be done."

<P>
KASHMIR: FEARS PERSIST THAT WAR COULD ERUPT ON THE U.N.-MONITORED TRUCE LINE, A 
LONG-TIME INVASION ROUTE.

CHIKOTHI CHECKPOINT, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a cold drizzle soaks this mile-high mountain redoubt, Pakistan Army Maj. 
Mohammed Najeeb peers far across the steep rocky gorge through high-power 
binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
There, perched high above raging rapids and a bombed-out bridge, an Indian 
sentry can be seen peering back from his own blockhouse and bunker complex. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the crucial point," said Najeeb. "This is the old invasion route for 
Kashmir." 
</P>
<P>
For now, despite fears that a new Indo-Pakistan war could erupt, a tense 
military standoff continues on the U.N.-monitored cease-fire line that has 
divided the region, officially known as Jammu and Kashmir, since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of the region were integrated into India, over Pakistani protests, 
as the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The other third is under Pakistani 
control, administered as two dependencies: Azad Kashmir, which lies to the west 
of the Indian state, and the Northern Areas. 
</P>
<P>
Three times India and Pakistan have gone to war, and three times their armies 
have clashed on the old British road that twists and climbs through rugged 
snow-capped mountains and swirling clouds for 240 miles from Islamabad in 
Pakistan to Srinagar in India. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire cut the road in half here. Sometimes a U.N. observer with a 
white flag crosses the swaying wooden footbridge. Sometimes, too, shots ring 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Today, all is tranquil on the so-called "line of control" except for the 
whistling wind and the bitter emotions that have brought two enemies conceived 
in crisis back to the brink. 
</P>
<P>
"This line is like the Berlin Wall," said army Lt. Abdul Saleem, gazing at the 
river that marks the line below. "It divides families, father from son, mother 
from daughter." 
</P>
<P>
The divisions are especially deep now. In recent weeks, thousands of Indian 
army troops have flooded into Jammu and Kashmir to crush a popular uprising led 
by separatists and Muslim fundamentalists. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, have died. 
</P>
<P>
"They mishandled womenfolk," charged Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan, president of 
Azad Kashmir. "They shoot children. They shoot demonstrators. They search 
houses and look at the belongings." 
</P>
<P>
News of the uprising in India has fueled a war hysteria among fellow Muslims 
and fellow Kashmiris in Pakistani villages along the border. 
</P>
<P>
In Chikothi village, several miles back from the line, about 75 men gather in a 
muddy street to chant anti-Indian slogans. Black flags of protest wave from 
ramshackle storefronts. Graffiti extol the Kashmiri cause. 
</P>
<P>
"We had three wars with India, but Kashmir was not decided," said Shazulla 
Awan, a bearded businessman. "So now we want to force them to settle the 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
He nods as Makata Latif, a fellow shop owner, says he wants to lead his fellow 
villagers across the border to help the militants that Pakistan calls freedom 
fighters and India calls terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
"Our brothers are being killed across the border," Latif said. "If they kill 
me, it doesn't matter. I am happy to make the sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
"My children will fight as I fought in 1947 -- for Kashmir," agrees Mier Abdul 
Latif, 60. 
</P>
<P>
Indian guards killed at least one youth and wounded a dozen others when they 
tried to cross the border south of here at Sialkot on Monday. Here, Pakistani 
officials say, they will stop the protesters for their own safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't let them cross," said district officer Sardar Mohammed Rahim Khan. 
"We'll use force if we must. Because if they cross, they'll be killed." 
</P>
<P>
Religious fear and prejudice also inflame the dispute. Islamic Pakistan feels a 
special kinship with Indian Kashmir since about 65% of the Indian state's 
population is Muslim. It is India's only state with a Muslim majority. 
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir is our homeland," said Nazir Durrani, a government clerk in 
Muzzafarabad, capital of Azad Kashmir. "In India, the Hindus occupy it. When 
the Muslims try to free Kashmir, the Hindus fight us. But it is not a Hindu 
state. It is a Muslim state." 
</P>
<P>
"All of them want to join Pakistan," said Rahatullah Khan, chief secretary of 
Azad Kashmir. "Ethnically, culturally, religiously, they are the same people." 
</P>
<P>
It remains, however, an Indian state -- and it is likely to remain one. 
</P>
<P>
"How long can we stay united if we allow one religion to secede?" asked J. N. 
Dixit, the Indian ambassador in Islamabad. "We have Muslims, we have Hindus, 
Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians." 
</P>
<P>
Political and military leaders in both countries say they are trying to avoid 
war. U.N. observers say no troop movements or special preparations have been 
seen. Officers are taking scheduled holidays. 
</P>
<P>
So for now, people like Durrani, 29, must wait. His family was divided during 
the 1948 war. He has waited all his life to meet his own brother, who got left 
on the Indian side. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even seen him," said Durrani.

alliance to fall, the Soviet Union is cautiously setting about the tough job of 
defining a new relationship with its East European neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
It is a job admittedly complicated by what one strategist calls the 
"inevitable" feelings of alienation in proud countries coerced by the Kremlin 
for two generations, and also by the uncertainties of German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling in our relations with these countries is that we shouldn't be 
trying to take any initiatives right now," said Alexander D. Nekipelov, deputy 
director of Moscow's Institute of Economics of the World Socialist System. "We 
shouldn't try to press anything on them." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "We're in the process of changing our policy. We have 
changed a lot vis-a-vis our relations with Western countries. And little by 
little we are also changing our attitude to what we used to call the countries 
of the socialist community." 
</P>
<P>
"Without change in the Soviet Union, there could have been no changes in 
Eastern Europe," added political scientist Pyotr Gladkov, reflecting a widely 
held pride here in the role that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika 
reform program at home and "new thinking" abroad played in the regional 
revolution. "However," he added, "the time has come to stop theorizing and 
begin formulating a specific policy for the region." 
</P>
<P>
The reassessment now under way goes even to the fundamental question of whether 
Eastern Europe is still all that important to Moscow, said Andrei V. Kortunov, 
a section head at the Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"One opinion holds that we just don't need Eastern Europe any more," he said in 
an interview. "We should be rivals rather than partners, competitors in Western 
markets and in seeking Western credits." 
</P>
<P>
The extension of this view is that there's no need to change the old structures 
of Moscow's East Bloc relations; they can just be allowed to die a natural 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the case for the opposite 
position in an interview published here late last month. While some 
developments in the region are a "cause of concern to us," he said, "we respect 
the will of peoples who are pushing to the fore other political forces. . . . 
In any event, East European countries remain our neighbors, allies, and 
friends. We hope to continue the closest cooperation with them. Any other 
course would run counter to the interests of our peoples." 
</P>
<P>
This course demands not only the overhaul of such traditional institutions as 
the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) and the Warsaw Pact 
military alliance but may well call for the establishment of new structures as 
well. Some have suggested formation of an East European parliament, similar to 
the West European body in Strasbourg, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Like almost everything else here these days, the view from Moscow of 
developments in Eastern Europe and of the future of Soviet-East European 
relations is inextricably bound with domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
The link was obvious at this week's pivotal plenary meeting of the Communist 
Party Central Committee, which made the historic decision to surrender the 
party's constitutionally guaranteed "leading role" in Soviet society and move 
toward genuine political pluralism here. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, we would have had this," Nekipelov said of the decisions. 
"But I suppose (East European developments) made it sooner." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, conservatives in the party are turning the question "Who 
lost Eastern Europe?" into an issue to use against Gorbachev and his fellow 
reformers. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody, comrades, must answer for all the failures, for the events in 
Eastern Europe, about which no one here seems to want to speak," Vladislav G. 
Anufriev, second secretary of the party organization in the Soviet republic of 
Kazakhstan, told the plenum delegates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our buffer zone has been destroyed," he went on. "OK -- let them live as they 
want. But today they are already laying territorial claims on us; they want 
material compensation; they ransack our consulates; they desecrate the graves 
of our fallen soldiers and our holy places; they humiliate a great power. And 
we again sink hundreds of millions (of rubles) into these countries, depriving 
our own people, extend hospitality to all sorts of Mazowieckis" -- a reference 
to Poland's Solidarity prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki. 
</P>
<P>
Anufriev is not the only one angry about what are seen here as anti-Soviet 
outbursts in Poland, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere. The Soviet press reports the 
news every time a statue of Lenin is defaced or toppled somewhere in Eastern 
Europe. National television has shown film of Czechoslovak demonstrations 
against the continued Soviet troop presence there, focusing on anti-Soviet 
placards and banners. 
</P>
<P>
"Some developments we don't like and we even think some of them are objectively 
going against our perestroika" reform program, said Nekipelov, who worries that 
this only strengthens the hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Czechoslovak government demands that at least half of all Soviet 
troops be pulled out of the country by mid-May and the rest by year-end, 
Nekipelov added: "I even understand their motive -- they say they don't know 
what will happen to our perestroika, and they want to get this done fast." 
</P>
<P>
But Prague risks a miscalculation, the Soviet official warned: "They think that 
only they have public opinion and not the Soviet Union. But now it's not 
exactly this way." 
</P>
<P>
While anti-Soviet outbursts in Eastern Europe cannot be justified, Gladkov 
noted in a column for the latest issue of Moscow News, "we must understand our 
share of responsibility" for the damage wreaked on the economy, culture, and 
pride of the former satellites. 
</P>
<P>
"They dislike not us, but 'them' whom we ourselves dislike," he wrote, 
referring to the old-style Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Some years of alienation are inevitable after this unhappy marriage," said 
Kortunov. Nevertheless, he and other strategists argue that there are ample 
geographic, historic, economic, and political reasons that the long-term 
outlook for constructive Soviet-East European relations is good. 
</P>
<P>
Nekipelov said 10% of all consumer goods sold here come from Eastern Europe, a 
significant percentage by any standard and particularly so given the chronic 
shortages of such goods in the Soviet Union. Also, he noted, imports from 
Eastern Europe now account for one-fifth of the new capital equipment added to 
the country's industrial base each year. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Soviet Union is the primary supplier of fuel and raw 
materials to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Even more important," said Nekipelov, "is that a very significant part of 
their economies now oriented to the Soviet Union cannot be reoriented quickly 
to other countries, mainly because of the (low) quality of these goods." 
</P>
<P>
Even as the newly freed nations of Eastern Europe strengthen their economic and 
other ties to the West, the Soviet-led Comecon trading bloc will remain crucial 
to them "in the transitional stage," the political economist commented. "We 
need each other. But they need us more." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan I. Antonovich, vice chancellor in charge of research at the Communist 
Party Central Committee's Academy of Social Sciences, concurred. "I believe 
that with the new regimes, we could establish quite satisfactory economic 
relations, on which some satisfactory level of social trust can be 
established," he said. The "prognosis for relations on an equal level are 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Politically, Soviet strategists believe that their old allies will be anxious 
to retain good connections as a counterbalance to the rich and influential 
unified Germany that virtually all Europe now sees as both inevitable and 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
While Moscow has watched its old idea of an East European buffer zone crumble, 
it still has a strategic interest in seeing that whatever its politics, the 
region remains reasonably stable. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe even more important to reformers here is that Eastern Europe remain a 
credible model, a "window on the West," as one analyst here put it. In this 
view, while all but the most radical of those reformers see this country 
proceeding more slowly, and perhaps not as far, on the road of political 
transformation as its former satellites, those countries can still be useful in 
keeping the process here on track. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a hope that the example of Eastern Europe will push our leadership in 
the same direction," said Kortunov.

ROMANCE: IN A STORYBOOK ENDING, A CLOSE ADVISER TO GORBACHEV TAKES THE HAND OF 
FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT'S KIN.

<P>
Not long ago it would have been too preposterous an idea for any but the most 
far-fetched of romantic novels: The granddaughter of a former American 
President marrying a top Soviet space scientist and friend of the country's 
Communist Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
But the world has been turned on its head since then, and Friday, an idea too 
outlandish for fiction became fact. Susan Eisenhower, 38, granddaughter of the 
late Dwight D. Eisenhower, married Roald Z. Sagdeyev, 57, adviser to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and close friend of the late Nobel Peace 
laureate and physicist, Andrei D. Sakharov. 
</P>
<P>
Their union, everyone agreed, was both a measure of the political change in the 
world and a symbol of hope for its future. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Russian guests even showed up wearing an "I Like Ike" button, which 
mysteriously found its way here after one of Dwight Eisenhower's 1950s election 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
There were two ceremonies, a standard, five-minute civil procedure at a special 
Soviet "marriage palace" used for important weddings, followed by a short 
religious service at the elegant official residence of U.S. Ambassador Jack F. 
Matlock Jr.. The groom, according to one guest at the second ceremony, said his 
vows in Russian, the bride in English. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage happened to coincide with an important official visit to Moscow by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III. And it came just two days after a 
historic decision by the Soviet Communist Party leadership to move toward a 
multi-party system and an American-style presidency -- "convergence" by almost 
any standard. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who would normally have been Matlock's guest at the official Spaso House 
residence during his stay, deferred to the wedding and sought quarters 
elsewhere. He reportedly did not even make it to the reception because his 
talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Gorbachev went longer 
than expected. But Baker's wife, Susan, was there. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many joint Soviet-American projects, ranging from space to 
biotechnology, but today's 'project' is sui generis (unique)," wrote a 
correspondent for the official Tass news agency in his account of the union. 
Many other Soviet-American marriages have occurred, he added, but never 
involving people of such "high status." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the approximately 300 guests at the Spaso House reception were Soviet 
citizens. The media was barred except for a handful of photographers permitted 
inside for a five-minute "photo opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
A few clusters of ordinary Russians stood in a park across the street watching 
as a parade of official black Volga and Chaika automobiles sped up to the front 
gate and disgorged their well-dressed passengers. It was obvious by the large 
number and variety of fur coats on display that the animal rights movement has 
had little echo here in what American residents sometimes call "The Big Red 
Apple." 
</P>
<P>
"Good day, comrades!" said the jovial police guard at the mansion's entrance as 
he intercepted arriving guests. "Your invitations, please." 
</P>
<P>
A few of the guests were famous enough that he dispensed with the formality. 
"Of course you have an invitation," he remarked to one senior government 
official. Then, with a salute, a smile, and a wave toward the entrance, he 
invited: "Please!" 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Soviet guests brought gifts, some of them bound in cheap but scarce 
white wrapping paper, others carried in plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, whose face and voice are 
familiar to television viewers around the world, struggled up the icy driveway 
with his wife gripping his left arm and carrying a large basket of flowers in 
his right. 
</P>
<P>
Among other guests were Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, the Russian poet 
Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
The bride wore an off-white, two-piece suit. Her daughter by a former marriage 
was a flower girl. Sagdeyev also has two grown children from an earlier 
marriage, which ended in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
The couple met in Chautauqua, N.Y., three years ago at a conference on 
Soviet-American relations. According to the Tass account of the meeting: "At a 
reception, the Soviet academician, giving the lie to the widely held view of 
the Russians as square and reserved, mounted the stage and, applauded by his 
audience, sang 'When the Saints Go Marching In,' and then danced, and danced, 
and danced with Susan." 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower, one of four children of John Eisenhower, later helped transcribe 
and edit the English-language version of Sagdeyev's memoirs, which are soon to 
be published in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower has called the marriage an indication of how times are changing for 
the better. She has said the couple was anxious about the reaction when they 
notified Soviet and American authorities of their intention to wed, but that 
fortunately their relationship evolved at a time that this country was changing 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up, said the normally unromantic Tass, to a "sensational" love 
story.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III will make an unscheduled stop in Romania 
this weekend after his trip to Moscow, the government announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Romania since the 
December revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Dan 
Radulescu, spokesman for the governing National Salvation Front, said Baker 
would spend "a few hours" in Bucharest, probably Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Bulgaria, the state BTA news agency reported Friday that Baker 
will stop today in Sofia en route from Moscow to Romania. The one-paragraph 
dispatch offered no details beyond saying Baker would arrive in the afternoon. 
It will be the first visit to Bulgaria by a U.S. secretary of state.

259 SEATS IN NEW ROMANIA UNITY COUNCIL

The Council of National Unity, formed to run Romania until May 20 elections, 
met for the first time Friday and agreed to expand to 259 members to provide a 
broad base of interim government. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus to increase the membership from 180 came after more than four 
hours of debate at the former National Assembly building and was viewed as the 
first instance of democratic decision-making in Romanian government in more 
than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Interim President Ion Iliescu, who led the outgoing National Salvation Front's 
ruling council, presided over the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier decision to expand to 241 members was superseded to give even 
greater representation. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly building is being used for the first time since the uprising 
against Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and 
executed on Christmas Day. It also is the first time since the revolution that 
opposition groups have had a role in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In the original 180-seat council agreed on last week, party and non-party blocs 
were to get three seats each. The 90 seats were to be divided among 29 
political parties and the National Salvation Front, which considers itself a 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
In the expanded council agreed on Friday, 114 seats went to 38 parties; 27 
seats to nine organizations representing ethnic minorities; 3 seats will be 
filled by former political prisoners, and 114 seats go to promient Romanians 
from all walks of life who were part of the National Salvation Front.

PHASE-OUT PREDICTED FOR U.S. BASES AT CLARK AND SUBIC;

PHILIPPINES: MOST CONTENTIOUS NEGOTIATIONS YET LOOM LATER THIS MONTH. CONGRESS

<P>
U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt's voice was only fair but his meaning was clear 
when he shed his coat and picked up a guitar to sing the blues -- literally -- 
to several dozen diplomats and Philippine President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the base review blues," he warbled. "Blue as I can be." 
</P>
<P>
 The figures make me stagger; 
</P>
<P>
 The compensation is so high; 
</P>
<P>
 They're asking me for billions; 
</P>
<P>
 I think I'm gonna die. 
</P>
<P>
Platt's five-verse blues at a weekend Malacanang Palace luncheon last month for 
diplomats from 55 countries was no easy tune. The United States and the 
Philippines are facing the most contentious negotiations yet over the future of 
two of the largest and most strategic U.S. military bases overseas, Clark Air 
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. With preliminary talks expected this month, key 
officials in Washington and Manila now privately predict a 5- to 10-year U.S. 
phase-out from the bases. The new relationship would include more joint-use 
arrangements such as those common at American bases in NATO countries and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"We know the question is not if we leave," one U.S. official explained. "It's 
when and how." So for now, both sides are playing politics. 
</P>
<P>
In Manila, a growing number of influential clergy members, mainstream 
politicians and newspaper editorial writers have demanded that Washington 
either quit the bases or pay far more than the $481 million that President 
Ronald Reagan pledged in 1988. The current two-year leases expire in September, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism grew to a chorus after President Bush authorized American F-4 
Phantom fighter-bombers from Clark to pin down rebel planes on the ground at 
the height of the Dec. 1 coup attempt. Critics charge that Aquino is now 
beholden to Bush for helping save her government. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials concede that their negotiating position has been complicated 
because Congress so far has refused to appropriate the full $481 million in 
cash, investment guarantees, military assistance and other aid promised two 
years ago. That executive agreement committed the White House only to use its 
"best efforts" to get the money from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem is the U.S. government is not coming up with enough money, 
even what was promised," U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said. "We keep 
saying, 'Wait, we'll try.' But we can't even say we'll succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Huchel said no hard figures exist, but he estimates that Congress may renege on 
$40 million to $60 million of the total pledged. "The budget is tight," he 
said. "It's a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials do not disagree. Aquino said last month that the shortfall 
will be a "threshold question" when the negotiators meet. Meanwhile, she 
stressed the relaxation of tension between Washington and Moscow and pointedly 
pushed a University of the Philippines study on converting the bases to 
civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
On the American side, Ambassador Platt has said the U.S. government could 
remove its forces within a year but that it would be "disastrous" for the 
Philippine economy. In Washington, military officials have leaked documents 
proposing major cuts here and have suggested moving operations to Guam, Japan 
and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
Clark and Subic together have long been a political lightning rod. Although 
surveys indicate that most Filipinos support the bases, many educated Filipinos 
consider them a vestige of U.S. colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has long described Clark and Subic, both about 50 miles north of 
Manila, as the key to forward strategic deployment in the Pacific arena. Subic 
is home to the U.S. 7th Fleet and provides a key base for ship repair, 
training, hospitals and supplies. Clark is home to U.S. Air Force tactical 
fighter wings that cover the Philippines, Southeast Asia and part of the Indian 
Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 U.S. troops, military dependents and civilian employees are 
stationed at the two giant bases and at four smaller military facilities, 
including a mountain camp for rest and relaxation. 
</P>
<P>
Military strategists say the bases are crucial for guarding strategic sea 
lanes, including three narrow straits that provide access to oil and commerce 
from the Indian Ocean and the Middle East. With the Cold War apparently ending, 
the officials now downplay the long-trumpeted Soviet threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are we out here?" a Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, asked aloud 
during a recent tour of Subic. "We're not necessarily here to counter the 
Soviets. We're a trading nation. Someone cuts our trade, we die." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, supporters argue that the bases are key to the Philippine economy. 
The United States is the nation's second-largest employer, with about 79,000 
Filipinos on the payroll and about $500 million in annual salaries and 
compensation. All told, the embassy estimates that the bases directly and 
indirectly account for 7% of the Philippines' gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials also insist that the bases help provide security. One diplomat 
noted, for example, that only 44 of 248 ships in the Philippine navy and coast 
guard are seaworthy, and those 44 only barely so. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't and don't operate out of sight of land," he said. "This country is 
naked." 
</P>
<P>
Critics counter that the U.S. jets deployed in the December coup attempt were 
the first foreign force used here since World War II. "People's eyes were 
opened that these weapons could be used against the Philippine people, not just 
against foreign invaders," said Aquino's estranged vice president, Salvador H. 
Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, critics say, the bases are a "magnet" for nuclear attack, and their 
existence only fuels the 20-year-old Communist insurgency in these islands. 
They blame the bases, moreover, for the bars, prostitution, AIDS and other 
social ills that have proliferated nearby. 
</P>
<P>
And even some supporters of Washington say Aquino compromised her country 
during the coup. "It was demeaning," said Olangapo Mayor Richard Gordon, whose 
city depends on the Subic Bay facility. 
</P>
<P>
Converting the bases will not be easy or cheap. A University of the Philippines 
study last October proposed a variety of uses, from a new international airport 
to new housing settlements, but noted that "the actual feasibility of these 
transfers has yet to be studied." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are skeptical. At Subic, Mukri said the agreement would allow 
the Navy to remove "anything that is not tied down." 
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos would inherit "the piers, but not any of the equipment," he said. 
"Not the cranes, not the lights, not the generators, not the trucks. The 
floating drydocks are gonna float away." 
</P>
<P>
So for now, the political sparring continues. At the weekend lunch, Platt said 
he composed his "Base Review Blues" during the lengthy 1988 negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"The blues were invented by people who felt they were in trouble," he said, 
picking at his guitar. "This was no exception."

JACKSON KEEPS RIVALS, BACKERS GUESSING ON RACE FOR MAYOR; 
</P>
<P>

Jesse Jackson knows how to keep them guessing. 
</P>
<P>
During his first race for President in 1984, the former civil rights leader had 
Democrats fretting over whether he would support the standard-bearer, Walter F. 
Mondale. When he ran again in 1988, he kept everyone wondering for months what 
he wanted in return for his support of Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, Jackson is causing the same kind of consternation among the people of 
Washington, D.C., who want to know whether he is going to run for mayor now 
that incumbent Marion Barry has been sidelined by drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
The question -- Will Jesse run? -- has drawn so much attention in recent weeks 
that some of the other Democratic candidates for the mayor's job are publicly 
pleading for him to make up his mind. Among them is Sharon Pratt Dixon, who 
demanded that Jackson disclose his plans by 5 p.m. Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson, true to the pattern he has set over the years, refused to meet 
Dixon's deadline. Instead, he announced that he will be unable to make a 
decision until Barry makes his plans known after he returns later this month 
from Florida, where he is undergoing treatment for substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that, when the mayor returns in late February . . . his 
decision is going to be critical to the options for service in the city," 
Jackson said. " . . . This is a delicate and sensitive situation; we'll have to 
use all the time and thoughts and prayers necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's friends and advisers say he intends to keep his options open at least 
until he returns from a trip to South Africa later this month and, perhaps, 
until the election filing deadline next July 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't expect an announcement soon," said one adviser, who asked not to be 
identified. "One thing that's constant -- he doesn't make a decision until he 
has to." 
</P>
<P>
Aides say that Jackson often keeps people guessing to draw attention to the 
issues he cares about as well as to allow himself the maximum amount of 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, according to his advisers, Jackson gave little thought to 
running for mayor of the District of Columbia, even though many people assumed 
that he was preparing to do so when he moved his principal residence from 
Chicago to Washington last year. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson's options were dramatically altered on Jan. 18, when Barry was 
arrested for allegedly buying and smoking crack cocaine under FBI surveillance. 
The arrest opened up a critically important career choice for Jackson -- one 
that his friend and adviser Ann Lewis likens to the two diverging roads in 
Robert Frost's well-known poem, "The Road Not Taken." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an enormous decision for him," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Jackson maintains that he has very little interest in the job. In 
fact, his attitude toward the race has tended to be so skeptical that he 
recently convinced New York Times columnist and former editor A.M. Rosenthal in 
an interview that he would not run. 
</P>
<P>
As he did in talking to Rosenthal, Jackson frequently observes that "the 
mayor's office would substantially limit my ability for national and 
international service," and he notes that Congress has much more control than 
the mayor over the budget of the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jackson clearly has not ruled out running. Many people who have 
talked to him as recently as Rosenthal came away with the impression that he is 
still interested in succeeding Barry. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, his willingness to consider the race has fueled a draft-Jackson 
movement led by a number of former Barry supporters whose influence in the city 
might be diminished by the election of one of the five other persons who have 
already declared their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
Also seeking the mayor's job are Democrats Dixon, former vice president of the 
local power company; City Council President David A. Clarke; council members 
Charlene Drew Jarvis and John Ray, and Republican Maurice T. Turner, the former 
police chief. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Washington Post poll indicated that Jackson, even though he certainly 
would be portrayed by his opponents as a carpetbagger, could defeat any of 
these lesser-known contenders. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democrats, outsiders as well as residents of the District, argue that 
Jackson ought to run for mayor because his lack of experience in elected office 
has been a handicap in his quest for the presidency. In their view, it would 
disprove Barry's controversial statement in an interview with the Los Angeles 
Times that "Jesse don't want to run nothing but his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
One of the primary proponents of this view is Bert Lance, the Georgia banker 
who served as budget director in the Jimmy Carter Administration and has been a 
Jackson adviser since 1984. Lance said the mayor's job would give Jackson a 
"platform" for his views on issues of national as well as international 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Borosage, a close Jackson adviser, said this view is advocated 
primarily by white Democrats who would like Jackson to abandon his presidential 
ambitions, believing that his candidacy is making it difficult for their party 
to choose a nominee who is sufficiently conservative to win the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post poll suggests that blacks, who represent 70% of the voting 
population in the District, are more strongly opposed to a Jackson candidacy 
for mayor than are whites. The survey showed that 53% of blacks opposed it, 
compared to 44% of whites. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackson views the decision facing him as a more complex matter than simply 
running for mayor or continuing his quest for the presidency, according to his 
advisers. As he sees it, there is a third option open to him that most other 
people do not recognize -- running for senator from the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
At present, of course, the District of Columbia has no voting representation in 
Congress because it is not a state. And the standard wisdom is that Congress 
will never bestow statehood on the District because its politics are too 
liberal for even the majority congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
But, ever since Jackson moved to Washington, he has been campaigning tirelessly 
to win statehood for the city. According to his aides, he has been telling 
Democrats that he would bow out of the presidential race if the District were 
granted statehood. 
</P>
<P>
"Statehood would measurably affect my options," Jackson said recently. "A 
senator has much more mobility than a governor. The Senate would allow me to 
serve nationally and internationally and be accountable to a local community." 
</P>
<P>
According to Jackson's advisers, Congress might be persuaded to grant statehood 
to the District if it were paired with statehood for Puerto Rico, which would 
probably become a Republican state. Then neither party would gain an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Although many cynics have viewed his statehood campaign as a way for Jackson to 
ingratiate himself with the citizens of the District of Columbia in advance of 
running for mayor, Jackson adviser Lewis insists that Jackson sees it as a 
simple battle for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Whether his campaign for statehood ultimately succeeds, Borosage said, 
Jackson's supporters across the country are overwhelmingly opposed to his 
running for mayor in Washington and abandoning his nationwide drive to build a 
Rainbow Coalition of blacks, Latinos and working-class whites. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most significant factor weighing against a campaign for mayor 
is that Jackson is about to begin a nationally syndicated television talk show 
to be known as "Voices of America with Jesse Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said that Jackson views the show as "an incredible opportunity" to 
influence Americans and would be reluctant to give it up to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, although Jackson does not accept the argument that he needs 
practical experience in government, his advisers say that he sees the problems 
of the District -- drugs, crime, poor schools, racial polarization -- as a 
challenge he would like to tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community in trouble -- primarily an African-American country," 
Borosage said. "He can demonstrate that African-American leadership can turn 
the city around. He can do the heavy lifting on drugs and education."

BENNETT SCORES CAPITAL OFFICIALS' ANTI-DRUG EFFORTS AS LACKLUSTER

William J. Bennett, director of national drug control policy, on Friday accused 
District of Columbia officials of lackluster efforts in the war on drugs, and a 
Bennett aide said the city let $2.4 million in federal funds slip away. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why it's heresy when I say it," Bennett told the Senate Budget 
Committee. "Everybody in this town knows that this government is not fulfilling 
its responsibilities to its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came at a hearing in which Democrats on the Senate Budget 
Committee questioned Bennett about efforts to combat drugs in the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) sought to spotlight the rampant problem in this 
city, whose mayor, Marion Barry, is in a Florida alcohol and drug clinic after 
his arrest on a cocaine possession charge. An aide has said that Barry is being 
treated primarily for alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser reminded Bennett that when he became drug policy director a year ago, he 
promised to make Washington a test case in the fight against drugs that still 
can be bought on street corners "only blocks from this Capitol." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that action by federal officials "cannot take the place of local 
government, federal initiatives cannot replace local initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
District police estimate that more than 60% of the 438 murders recorded in the 
nation's capital last year were drug related. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser said District of Columbia officials have complained that they have not 
received the assistance from the federal government that was promised in the 
early days of the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce L. Carnes, director of planning, budget and administration under Bennett, 
told the panel that the federal government has made a commitment to provide 
more than $90 million of the $102 million that the district sought. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that despite repeated warnings, district officials allowed $2.4 
million in Defense Department funds for bolstering the National Guard as a 
drug-fighting tool to lapse through inaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every penny of that lapsed because the district did not draw down that 
money," Carnes told lawmakers. "I kept telling them, the clock is ticking. . . 
. You've got to draw down that money, or it's going to lapse. It lapsed."

HAZELWOOD ALLOWED TO SEEK COAST GUARD BLAME

A judge cleared the way Friday for Joseph Hazelwood's lawyers to blame U.S. 
Coast Guard negligence rather than the skipper for the nation's largest oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone decided to allow cross-examination of two 
Coast Guard traffic monitors on the role that the agency's Vessel Traffic 
System played in the grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez last March 24. 
</P>
<P>
After brief legal arguments, Judge Johnstone ruled that the monitors can be 
questioned about how closely they were watching radar and whether they had a 
duty to notify Hazelwood that his ship was approaching rocky Bligh Reef. 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnstone refused, for now, to admit as evidence a blood-alcohol test 
given to one of the monitors 13-to-15 hours after the disaster. The test showed 
that one monitor, Bruce Blandford, had a reading of 0.203 -- more than double 
the legal limit for drunk driving in Alaska. Blandford has said he had four 
drinks of bourbon and water on returning home after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would reconsider his ruling if Hazelwood's lawyer, Dick 
Madson, can prove the issue's relevance. Madson, who maintains that the monitor 
was drinking on duty, said he planned to call experts to say that the drinks 
consumed after work could not have produced such a high reading. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Johnstone refused to admit the results of a urine test showing 
that the second monitor, Gregory Taylor, tested positive for marijuana three 
days after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the testimony so far has focused on liquor consumption. The prosecution 
maintains that Hazelwood spent the hours immediately before his ship sailed 
drinking vodka with shipmates and that he was drunk when the tanker grounded. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker spilled almost 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil, 
blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline, killing thousands of animals and 
hundreds of thousands of birds. Exxon says it has spent about $2 billion so far 
in cleaning up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelwood, 43, is being tried on a felony charge of second-degree criminal 
mischief and also on misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent 
discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony is to resume Monday with Taylor and Blandford scheduled as witnesses.

LEVINE, DREIER FILL WAR CHESTS WITH $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two California congressmen, Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) and David Dreier (R-La 
Verne), possible candidates for the Senate in 1992, have amassed campaign war 
chests of nearly $1.5 million each -- making them the leading money-raisers in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1989, Levine had $1,485,734 in the bank and Dreier had 
$1,457,087, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. 
While Dreier has often been among the leading fund-raisers, it was the first 
time Levine's fund-raising has put him in the top ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Levine's fund-raising success during 1989 stemmed from a 
$400-per-person dinner he sponsored at the Beverly Hilton last June, which 
raised more than $600,000. Overall, he took in $823,252 last year -- the 
largest amount raised by any House member. 
</P>
<P>
Dreier raised $156,996 last year, most of it at a single fund-raiser in his 
home district. His campaign fund had already exceeded $1 million at the 
beginning of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Only three other House members had campaign treasuries with more than $1 
million at the end of 1989. They were Reps. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) with 
$1,393,258; Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) with $1,052,336 and Ronnie G. Flippo 
(D-Ga.) with $1,012,832. 
</P>
<P>
These funds far exceeded the norm. On average, House members maintained a 
balance of $236,174 in their campaign accounts during 1989, according to 
calculations made by an organization of consumer advocate Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, most of the California congressmen who have large campaign 
war chests are believed to be eyeing a race for the Senate in 1992, when the 
state may see both of its seats available. Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston is up 
for reelection in 1992, and the seat held by Republican Sen. Pete Wilson will 
also be open if Wilson succeeds in his bid for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson spent more than $16 million to be reelected in 1988, and more than that 
is likely to be spent in 1992 by each Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Californian with the third-biggest campaign fund -- $756,099 -- was Rep. 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), another potential Senate candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Both Matsui and Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) have indicated that they will 
challenge Cranston for the Democratic nomination in 1992. So far, however, 
Boxer has only $315,484 in her campaign fund -- putting her at a disadvantage 
to potential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), who also has indicated an interest in running 
for the Senate, had $504,558 in his campaign fund at the end of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Levine nor Dreier has publicly acknowledged being a candidate for the 
Senate, although their names are frequently mentioned by activists in their own 
parties. In interviews, Levine declined to discuss the subject. Dreier said he 
has no plans to seek a Senate seat, even though he is "honored and flattered 
that there are a great many people who have asked me to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Levine and Dreier are not expecting any serious opposition for reelection to 
the House in November. Traditionally, there are four reasons why incumbents 
with no real opposition maintain large campaign funds: to discourage potential 
challengers, to run for a higher office, to protect themselves if their 
districts are altered in reapportionment, or to supplement their pension. 
</P>
<P>
House members elected before 1980 can pocket excess campaign funds upon 
retirement. But neither Levine nor Dreier can keep the money on retirement 
because they were elected after 1980. 
</P>
<P>
They said their huge war chests were designed primarily as a hedge against 
reapportionment in 1992. Dreier noted that he was forced to run against another 
Republican incumbent in 1982 after the last reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
"I said then, 'Let's concentrate on trying to have some kind of fund-raising 
effort, in case that happens again in 1992,' " Dreier said. "I was a Boy Scout, 
and it taught me to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most Democrats, who depend heavily on political action committees, 
Levine raised only 13%, or $109,700, of his contributions from PACs during 
1989. Dreier raised $32,125 from PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Election Commission records show that during the 1988 election cycle, 
52 House members financed their reelection entirely with PAC money, 41 of them 
Democrats. And 254 House members raised half of the money they spent on 
reelection from PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Other Californians with substantial campaign accounts at the end of 1989 were 
Reps. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), $720,386; Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), $467,258; George Miller (D-Martinez), $464,268; Norman Y. Mineta 
(D-San Jose), $368,526, and Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), $313,300. 
</P>
<P>
Only two other House members raised nearly as much money as Levine in 1989. 
They were House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who took in 
$625,808, and Rep. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), who won a special election after 
raising $638,693. Thomas replaced Rep. Dick Cheney, who became secretary of 
defense.

HARRIS' APRIL 3 EXECUTION DATE SHOULD STAND, ATTORNEYS INSIST

<P>
Robert Alton Harris should die as scheduled on April 3 in the gas chamber at 
San Quentin, the state's lawyers said Friday, urging the California Supreme 
Court to reject Harris' latest appeal as nothing more than a collection of old 
and recycled claims. 
</P>
<P>
In a legal brief filled with remarkably blunt language, the state attorney 
general's office said that Harris, convicted of the 1978 murders of two 
teen-age San Diego boys, had long ago failed to offer anything new that would 
suggest he was not fairly tried and sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough is enough," Louis R. Hanoian, a deputy attorney general from San Diego, 
said in the brief. "It is time to execute the sentence long ago imposed and 
repeatedly upheld." 
</P>
<P>
The April 3 date, set earlier this week by a San Diego Superior Court judge, 
actually is Harris' fourth scheduled execution date, but his first in eight 
years. If he goes to the gas chamber, Harris would become the first person 
executed in California in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a broad challenge to Harris' 
death sentence last month, his San Diego lawyers filed a new appeal with the 
California Supreme Court, contending in part that it would be cruel and unusual 
punishment to kill Harris because he had changed for the better in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Responding Friday, the attorney general's office rejected that claim as "a 
final act of desperation" -- one the procedural rules did not allow. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoian was equally scornful of Harris' 10 other claims, including one that it 
would be cruel to kill Harris after making him endure Death Row for 11 years. 
Since Harris orchestrated the delay by repeatedly asking state and federal 
courts for mercy, that claim was "so preposterous as to leave one breathless," 
Hanoian said.

Pacific Lumber Co. yielded to public and legislative pressure Friday and 
temporarily withdrew its controversial plan to log ancient redwoods in the 
Headwaters Forest near Eureka, but only as long as its other harvest plans are 
not challenged by environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck in talks between Charles Hurwitz, whose Maxxam Corp. of Los 
Angeles owns Pacific Lumber, and three coastal lawmakers: Rep. Douglas H. Bosco 
(D-Occidental), state Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia) and 
Assemblyman Dan Hauser (D-Arcata). 
</P>
<P>
"Our company has entered into this agreement in good faith and it is now time 
for our adversaries to show the same good faith," said John Campbell, president 
of Pacific Lumber, which owns the 3,000-acre forest, the largest privately 
owned, contiguous parcel of old-growth redwoods left on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists were generally hostile to terms of the deal, 
particularly a clause releasing Pacific Lumber from the agreement if a number 
of its other harvest plans are denied, even on legal environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Department of Fish and Game that determined the negative impact 
these harvest plans would have on the environment," said Cecelia Lanman of the 
Environmental Protection and Information Center, a Humboldt County group that 
has led the fight to save the forest. "I don't know how these legislators could 
agree to have Fish and Game not enforce the law." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Lumber's plans to selectively harvest the forest have been sharply 
criticized for endangering wildlife. State Department of Fish and Game 
biologists have withheld their approval until the company finds a way to 
minimize the damage that logging will do to animals in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Bosco aide Bruce Taylor said the informal agreement does not tie the hands of 
state regulators or environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
The conditional clause, he said, does not give Pacific Lumber special 
privileges or stop anyone from enforcing state laws. It merely acknowledges the 
company's right to re-submit harvest plans for the Headwaters Forest if no 
other timber source is available. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also lets the Legislature hire an independent auditor to see if 
the recent doubling of Pacific Lumber's normal rate of harvest is damaging the 
long-term productivity of its forests. The company has denied accusations that 
it is dangerously over-cutting to pay off the high-interest "junk" bonds used 
by Maxxam to acquire Pacific Lumber in a hostile takeover four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the agreement) allows the dust to settle and tempers to cool off so people 
can consider these issues calmly," Taylor said, adding that he did not know if 
the agreement is written or oral. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was negotiated in secret with only Hurwitz and the legislators in 
attendance -- a sore point with environmentalists.

DEL SHANNON, 55; SONGWRITER AND POP STAR HAD STRING OF HITS IN '60S 
</P>

Del Shannon, whose melancholy hits of the early 1960s came to personify the 
decline of his later professional years, has been found dead in his Santa 
Clarita home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Bonnie, found the singer-songwriter's body late Thursday night, said 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom. 
</P>
<P>
The balladeer on such classic hits as "Runaway," "Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow 
the Sun)" and "Hats Off to Larry" was 55. 
</P>
<P>
A .22-caliber rifle was found next to Shannon's body in the den of his home, 
Hom said. He said the death was being investigated as a suicide, but the exact 
cause had not yet been determined pending an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
His longtime manager, Dan Bourgoise, said Shannon had been depressed lately 
about his new house, in which he felt disoriented, and that he also had been 
ill with the flu for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But he also said Shannon was nearing completion of a new album with Tom Petty, 
Jeff Lynn and Mike Campbell, a member of Petty's group, the Heartbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was rolling along quite nicely," Bourgoise said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shannon's performances had been limited over the last two decades, he 
remained a force in music as a producer and in England as a performer, where he 
had become a favorite about the time the Beatles were emerging. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few early rockers to write his own material, Shannon soared to fame 
with "Runaway" after it was recorded by Detroit's Big Top label in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he was working as Charles Westover -- his given name -- in a 
carpet store in Battle Creek, Mich., during the day and appearing regularly at 
the Hi Lo Club there at night. 
</P>
<P>
He took the name "Shannon" from a wrestler he had met. "Del" was a contraction 
of the Cadillac Coupe de Ville his carpet store boss owned. 
</P>
<P>
"Runaway" had originated during a jam session one night and he wrote lyrics to 
the song of unrequited love the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The record featured Shannon's poignant falsetto, lamenting, Wishing you were 
here by me, to end this misery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The words came to typify the Shannon oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
He walked alone, wrote a Times reporter who interviewed him last April. "In his 
songs he was deceived, falling apart, searching for a place to hide and looking 
over his shoulder for the stranger in town." 
</P>
<P>
Shannon followed "Runaway" (four weeks at the top of the 1961 charts) with 
"Hats Off to Larry," "So Long Baby," "Hey! Little Girl," "Little Town Flirt," 
"Handy Man," "Keep Searchin'," "Stranger in Town" and "Sea of Love." The last, 
in 1982, was his first song to appear on the charts since "Stranger" in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Shannon had been dueling with personal demons. 
</P>
<P>
He fell out of favor with record producers because he had sued a succession of 
managers over his share of royalties. After the legal battles, recording 
companies shied away from him for fear they would be sued, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd had this string of hits, but I couldn't record," he said last year. "I was 
so frustrated I'd go out and play golf in the snow." 
</P>
<P>
And he was getting drunk every day. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 20 I was drinking and when I was 30 I was drinking more and at 40 
way too much." 
</P>
<P>
He got sober in 1979, he said, and two years later met Petty, who produced the 
album that contained "Sea of Love," which held on to the 33rd spot in the pop 
charts for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, television producer Michael Mann had Shannon, who had three children 
from his first marriage, re-record "Runaway" with new lyrics for the series 
"Crime Story." It is also featured in the current hit film "Born on the Fourth 
of July." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he performed in England and locally at Disneyland, and he had 
been rumored to be in line to fill the vacancy left when Roy Orbison of the 
Traveling Wilburys died in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't seem bitter, even though he acknowledged that "you're forgotten by 
some people." 
</P>
<P>
"What I do now is easy," he said last year. "I get to travel over the world, 
work an hour a night and get paid well." 
</P>
<P>
But conversely, he told the Associated Press recently that "this business will 
eat you up. If it becomes your love and you don't have humans to love, I think 
you're in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the rocker's career, Times critic Robert Hilburn said Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"Del Shannon enjoyed his greatest success at a time in the early '60s when rock 
'n' roll seemed in danger of fading from the pop scene -- a time when most of 
the music's key early artists had lost momentum and the pop Establishment was 
actively in search of more polite sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"But Shannon's best records -- especially the dark, obsessive strains of 
'Runaway' and 'Stranger in Town' -- reflected a passion and craft that not only 
kept the spirit of rock alive until the Beatles arrived, but which continued to 
inspire new generations of musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Rock music writer Steve Hochman contributed to this obituary.

CHINATOWN: HOPING TO AVOID A DISPUTE, THE CHINESE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BANNED 
THE STATUE FROM TODAY'S PARADE. BUT MEMORIES OF TIAN AN MEN SQUARE PROMPT A 
PROTEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Eight months, 6,000 miles and a dramatic chapter of history removed from the 
student uprising it helped to inspire in Beijing, the Goddess of Democracy is 
in the middle of a controversy that is dividing the Chinese community in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that it would provoke dissent among local Chinese, the Chinese Chamber 
of Commerce banned a float featuring a six-foot replica of the statue from the 
Chinese New Year's parade it is sponsoring today in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the divisiveness the chamber said it had hoped to avoid has 
surfaced as pro-democracy supporters in Los Angeles react to the business 
organization's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Los Angeles chapter of the Federation for a Democratic China, 
which sought to enter the goddess float in the annual parade, are accusing the 
chamber of trying to erase from public memory the bloodshed that occurred last 
June in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
"It's now the Chinese Chamber of Commerce that is crushing the symbol," said 
David Ma of Arcadia, a board member of the Paris-based federation, formed last 
fall to promote democratic reform in China. He said his group will lead a 
protest decrying the chamber's decision at today's 3 p.m. parade. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber board member Irvin Lai defended his organization's stance by saying 
that his group is bound by its charter not to take sides on political issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber is a business organization," Lai said. "We do not take part in 
partisan politics. We do not wish to promote divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
The statue at the heart of the controversy is a replica of the one that Chinese 
troops bulldozed in Tian An Men Square last June after squelching pro-democracy 
protests there. It is smaller than a 23-foot replica erected in downtown Los 
Angeles last June and later moved to Chinatown, where it was destroyed by 
vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the chamber and the Federation for a Democratic China 
highlights a split in the Chinese community over whether the time has come to 
put the Beijing massacre in the past. 
</P>
<P>
After the chamber's 14-4 vote last week to deny the Goddess of Democracy entry 
to the parade, federation members immediately wrote a letter of protest to the 
chamber board. The letter accused chamber members of "betraying their 
consciences" and helping people to forget the bloodshed in China last summer. 
</P>
<P>
For years, cultural celebrations in the Chinese community have been used by 
some as opportunities to express political loyalties. In San Francisco's 
Chinatown, for example, merchants on one side of a street will fly flags of 
communist China on Oct. 1 -- China's national holiday -- while merchants on the 
other side will display flags recognizing the Taiwan government's national 
holiday on Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Lai said that in Los Angeles, the chamber has always rejected attempts by 
various groups to use its New Year's parade as a political forum. In the past, 
he said, the chamber has denied requests by groups who want to fly foreign 
flags on the floats. "We're strictly an American organization," Lai said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the Goddess of Democracy is political," Ma said. The statue, in 
his opinion, stands for human rights and is an American symbol. "She just 
symbolizes our system, our way of life, our values. What we want to display on 
the float is the symbol of Americans for two centuries." 
</P>
<P>
Ma said his group was willing to compromise by eliminating from its float the 
banners that would have referred to the Communist leadership's bloody crackdown 
in Tian An Men Square. But Chamber President Ken Chan said the chamber never 
received such a proposal from the federation. 
</P>
<P>
Chan said denials of float applications are routine, and that the federation's 
entry was not singled out. "They are not the only ones denied." 
</P>
<P>
He declined, however, to cite examples of other unsuccessful applicants to the 
parade, which the chamber has sponsored in Chinatown for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the Chinese community have also questioned whether business ties 
between the chamber and the Chinese government might have influenced the 
group's decision, but chamber board member Fred Hong noted that the chamber's 
150 to 200 members do business not only with China, but also with Taiwan and 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Ma said he respects the chamber's right to stay neutral, but he added that he 
believes Chinese-Americans should not be discouraged from speaking out for 
democracy in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Chinese community is divided," Ma said. "Let's face it. A lot of people 
have different opinions vis-a-vis democracy in China."

WORKERS REVERSE VOTE, REJECT UNION AT 10 CEMETERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an election sponsored by the Catholic Church and condemned as a "sham" by 
organized labor, workers at 10 Catholic cemeteries in the Los Angeles area 
voted overwhelmingly Friday against unionization, reversing a close pro-union 
vote a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's vote -- which may eventually be nullified by a lawsuit filed against 
the Archdiocese of Los Angeles by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers 
Union -- further embittered relations between organized labor and Archbishop 
Roger M. Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony announced last week that he was breaking off negotiations with the 
textile workers union, which assumed it had won bargaining rights on behalf of 
150 cemetery workers through November. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony called a new election after saying he had received petitions from scores 
of workers saying they no longer wanted union representation. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four voted in favor of maintaining unionization and 92 against in the 
Friday election. Twenty-five other workers deposited blank ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"From our viewpoint, the issue is settled," said Bill Rivera, archdiocese 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Mejia, manager of the union's California board, which refused the 
archdiocese's request to co-sponsor the second election, said she was not 
surprised by the results. She maintained that the church "controlled" the 
results by forbidding workers to talk about the issue, keeping union 
representatives off cemetery grounds and firing several pro-union workers 
during the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Cemetery workers began organizing in 1988, saying they wanted higher pay, 
better medical benefits and an end to oppressive treatment from supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The church agreed to hold an election in February, 1989, after the National 
Labor Relations Board declined to sponsor a vote, saying it did not have 
jurisdiction over religious organizations. After a campaign marked by frequent 
threats of violence between pro- and anti-union workers, the union narrowly won 
the election, 66 to 62. A three-member panel, with members approved by both 
sides, examined allegations of misconduct and concluded last November that the 
union had won fairly. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a labor contract between the union and the church did not begin 
until last month. Two weeks after they began, Mahony declared them over. He 
said the two sides had agreed that the union's representation would last for 
only a year, and that he considered the year over. 
</P>
<P>
In response, angry union leaders on Tuesday sued Mahony in Superior Court, 
saying the archdiocese is obligated to negotiate with them for a year that 
began with last November's arbitration panel decision, not last February's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Church spokesman Rivera said he believed Friday's anti-union vote came because 
the election was held without a long campaign and because of improvements in 
wages and working conditions. The union acknowledges that those changes 
resulted since the original organizing drive. 
</P>
<P>
Rivera said Mahony, in an effort to mend fences after the episode, plans to 
hold a "Mass of reconciliation" for workers and probably a subsequent Mass for 
organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony is scheduled to return this weekend from a weeklong visit with the 
archbishops of three Central American countries. 
</P>
<P>
Mejia said the only way Mahony can diminish the bitterness of labor leaders 
toward him "is possibly to say he was wrong."

EX-MORTICIAN CHARGED IN OLEANDER POISONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is believed to be the first murder prosecution in American history for 
oleander poisoning, authorities filed charges Friday against a former Pasadena 
funeral home worker accused of using the lethal plant's leaves to poison a 
rival mortician. 
</P>
<P>
David Wayne Sconce, 33, was charged with poisoning Timothy R. Waters, 24, a 
rival Burbank mortician, in 1985. The motive, according to Los Angeles County 
Assistant Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss, was to keep Waters from 
exposing activities at the Lamb Funeral Home where Sconce worked. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce is now serving a five-year prison term after pleading guilty last April 
to 21 criminal counts involving the mingling of human remains, the theft of 
body parts and the removal of gold teeth from cadavers at the funeral home. It 
was these activities that Giss alleges Sconce was trying to keep secret by 
poisoning Waters. 
</P>
<P>
Sconce's parents, Laurieanne Lamb Sconce and Jerry Sconce, are awaiting trial 
on charges of mingling remains and other charges connected with activities at 
the funeral home. The allegations amounted to the "worst scandal I've ever 
seen, or that I could ever imagine," California Cemetery Board Executive 
Officer John W. Gill said in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Lamb, an uncle of David Sconce who is now running the family mortuary, 
said he believes in his nephew's innocence. He said the murder charges, on top 
of the earlier accusations, have "devastated" the family. 
</P>
<P>
According to Giss, the case began in the 1970s when Laurieanne Lamb Sconce took 
over the operation of the 67-year-old Lamb Funeral Home. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, according to Giss, David Sconce took control of the Pasadena 
Crematorium in Altadena, a part of the family operation. He started a business 
called Coastal Cremations Inc., taking in bodies for cremation on behalf of 
other mortuaries throughout Southern California for as little as $55 each. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried to corner the market," said Joe Estephan, the funeral director of 
the Cremation Society of California. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Waters began operating the Alpha Society cremation service in 
Burbank, Giss said. In January, 1985, Giss said, Waters told a friend, Richard 
Gray, that the Lamb Funeral Home was doing multiple cremations -- packing more 
than one body into the ovens, making it impossible to be sure whose remains 
were delivered to survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Giss said Gray relayed the information about Waters to Sconce. Giss also said 
Waters was intending to turn Sconce in to state funeral regulators. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1985, Waters was beaten at his office, and Sconce was charged with 
assault. He pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Then in April, 1985, Waters died at his parents' home in Camarillo after 
becoming ill while baby-sitting for his sister in Malibu. The cause of death 
was originally listed as a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Fredrick Rieders, a Pennsylvania expert on oleander poisoning brought 
in by Los Angeles authorities, later said after an analysis of blood samples 
from Waters' body that oleander poisoning was the true cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
While one witness said that he saw Sconce slip an unknown substance into 
Waters' drink at a restaurant, prosecutors said they were uncertain how the 
alleged poisoning occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Deaths from oleander poisoning are rare, but a number have occurred over the 
years. Some cases are accidental, as in a California case several years ago 
when a woman died after brewing an oleander tea from what she thought were 
harmless leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Giss said he believes that this is the first time anyone has been prosecuted 
for using oleander as a murder weapon in the United States, although there had 
been at least one prosecution involving the use of oleander as a folk medicine.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL VOTES TO GIVE NIGHT STALKER REWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Friday to give $25,000 in 
rewards to 14 people instrumental in the 1985 capture of Richard Ramirez, who 
was convicted last year in the string of Night Stalker murders. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who faces a second murder trial in San Francisco, was convicted Sept. 
20 of 13 murders and has been sentenced to death for a series of crimes that 
terrorized Southern California in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
If Mayor Tom Bradley signs the measure, it will mark the last of more than 
$71,000 in rewards to be approved by local and state officials to citizens in 
both Northern and Southern California who helped authorities identify and 
arrest the self-avowed devil worshiper in August, 1985.

The two tourists, Susan Conradt and Arne Frischmuth, said they showed up at the 
Century City demonstration to get a firsthand look at an American political 
protest. They were arrested along with eight protesters who demonstrated 
outside the hotel while President Bush was inside speaking at a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
Conradt and Frischmuth declined to comment but six activists who met them in 
jail said at a press conference Friday that the couple merely wanted to watch 
the event.

BAR CROWD MELEE LEAVES 2 WOUNDED IN PASADENA 
</P>

In the midst of an altercation by patrons leaving Romeo's, a popular Pasadena 
club in the heart of Old Pasadena, a California Highway Patrol officer 
accidentally shot a police officer and a bouncer early Friday, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven people were arrested, five women and two men, on charges that included 
interfering with a police officer, assault with a deadly weapon and public 
intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses were at a loss to explain the melee, involving at least 20 
patrons of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all drunk, screaming back and forth," said bouncer Mark Underwood, 
whose co-worker, Devin Beasley, took a shotgun pellet in the side of his knee. 
"Who knows what it was about?" 
</P>
<P>
Underwood said the shotgun had discharged after the CHP officer had used the 
weapon as a cudgel on a man officers were trying to subdue. "I saw (the 
officer) had his finger on the trigger, so I started moving," Underwood said. 
"I got behind a Blazer that was parked there. My friend didn't quite make it." 
</P>
<P>
The CHP would not comment on specifics of the shooting, saying that it was 
under investigation by the department's shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded Pasadena police officer was in stable condition, and the bouncer 
was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants and workers in Old Pasadena, a colorfully remodeled district of 
restaurants, bars and clothing stores which developers sometimes tout as 
"Westwood East," said that the incident reveals a persistent underside to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the transformation of the Old Town, which was a Skid Row 10 years ago, 
"you can go a block in either direction and still get mugged," said Vincent 
Terzo, co-owner of a neighborhood bar on Colorado Boulevard next door to 
Romeo's. 
</P>
<P>
He and his sister, Jennine, said that the alley behind their bar, The 
Thirty-Fiver, was a frequent site for fistfights between departing patrons of 
Romeo's, a basement dance club with marble columns and neon strip lights. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost got hit myself recently," said Jennine Terzo. "Someone was taking a 
swing at somebody and they just missed me." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Sasaki, who works in a surfing shop on Fair Oaks Boulevard, said he 
avoided the alley. "A lot of things happen back there, a lot of fights," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pasadena police, the fight began in the alley and spread to an 
adjoining parking structure, where somebody fired a shot. Police subsequently 
retrieved a .357 Magnum with one spent round, said Lt. Greg Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena police arrived at the scene shortly after a passer-by had hailed a 
Highway Patrol radio car. Officers from both departments tried to break up the 
disturbance, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Sgt. Mike Brey said matters escalated when a man in the alley became "loud 
and boisterous," forcing officers to try to subdue him. The shotgun discharged 
during the scuffle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP would not identify the officer holding the shotgun. "We have to give 
the officer a chance to notify his family in the area of what happened," said 
Brey. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood said the unruly man was resisting arrest. "They were trying to get 
the guy down, but he didn't want to be handcuffed," Underwood said. "The CHP 
guy first hit him in the head with the butt of the shotgun, then he started 
swinging it with his finger on the trigger. It was very stupid."

RESCUED DOGS FACE AN UNCERTAIN FATE;

Josephine Forman never could say no to a mutt in distress. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Rosemead woman took them in by the dozens, even though it 
strained her modest Social Security income. 
</P>
<P>
She boarded the dogs at a nearby kennel, where she received a discount for 
grooming and feeding the dogs herself. 
</P>
<P>
But Forman died in December, and 26 of the mixed-breed dogs she saved from the 
streets are once again facing the pound. 
</P>
<P>
Before she died, she specified that the dogs should go to Artis Rose of San 
Diego, a longtime friend who shared her love of animals. Since Forman's death, 
Rose has made the 220-mile round trip to the kennel several times a week to 
groom and feed the dogs. She has paid half of this month's rent, but says she 
doesn't have the money to pay the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Warren, owner of the Astro/All Star Kennel in Rosemead, who had been 
charging Forman $500 a month instead of the regular $5 a day per dog, said he 
will turn the dogs over to animal regulation authorities soon. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I supposed to do with all these dogs?" Warren asked. "As long as she 
was here to clean the dogs and pay the rent, I was happy. . . . These dogs have 
to be cleaned . . . every day and I just can't do it by myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a mean person," Warren continued. "All I want is money to take care of 
these dogs or someone to take them away." 
</P>
<P>
At Temple City Animal Control, the nearest such facility, young, healthy dogs 
are kept for a week or so in the hope that someone will claim them, said 
supervisor Bill Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Older, sickly dogs are put to death immediately, he said. Forman's dogs average 
between 7 and 8 years old, but one is 16, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
When Forman was alive, she received assistance from Animal Alliance, which has 
offices in West Los Angeles and Woodland Hills, whenever she ran short of money 
for dog food. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many times when she would call us and she was hysterical because 
she had no money or food for the dogs, and we tried to help her as much as we 
could," said Leeta Anderson, founder of Animal Alliance, which is devoted to 
rescuing animals in need. "She really cared about these dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Rose has taken three of the dogs into her own home, and one of Forman's 
neighbors agreed to take six others. Twenty-six of Forman's dogs remain at the 
kennel. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a horrible situation," Anderson said. "The man (Warren) has a business 
to take care of. He can't just keep these dogs forever. On the other hand, we 
have these creatures that need to be taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is contacting other animal rescue organizations to mobilize help for 
the dogs. But she says the best solution would be for people to adopt the 
animals and "let them live out the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The people who knew Forman say the dogs were her entire life and it was her 
last wish to see them taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
"She really loved these dogs," Rose said. "She always had dogs, even when she 
lived in an apartment."

$135 MILLION IN SHAM PROFITS CITED AT LINCOLN S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan generated $135 million in sham profits 
through overpriced sales of land to "straw" buyers, an accounting expert 
testified Friday in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
About half of Lincoln's earnings between 1984 and its seizure by the government 
in 1989 came from the dubious sale of land in the Phoenix area, said Roger 
Johnson, a witness for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate proceeding in federal court in Los Angeles, the brokerage firm 
Drexel Burnham Lambert and its one-time junk bond guru Michael Milken were 
added as defendants in a class-action lawsuit against Lincoln Savings Chairman 
Charles H. Keating Jr. that claims investors lost $200 million investing in 
worthless securities sold by the thrift's parent. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Drexel Burnham nor Milken could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The investor suit charges that Milken knew that Lincoln's parent company -- 
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix -- was no longer able to issue debt 
through the traditional means of an underwritten public offering and instead 
chose to sell its debt illegally through its Lincoln branches in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham underwrote American Continental debt, and American Continental 
purchased junk bonds from Drexel Burnham. The suit said Milken aided American 
Continental and Lincoln in engaging in false commercial real estate and 
securities transactions. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Lincoln may ultimately cost the government $2 billion to 
liquidate or dismantle the institution, the costliest case in the massive wave 
of S&amp;L shutdowns. American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection last 
April 13, and Lincoln was seized by federal regulators the next day. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, American Continental is suing the federal government to overturn 
the seizure of Lincoln. Judge Stanley Sporkin is conducting a mini-trial 
dealing with some of the complex real estate and tax transactions. He is trying 
to determine whether American Continental should be entitled to a full trial on 
its complaint that regulators acted unfairly in seizing Lincoln in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who spent a full day on the stand for direct testimony and cross 
examination, said he was "shocked" by Lincoln's "contrived transactions" in the 
sale of land. The S&amp;L "ended up having more paper than cash" after its 
dealings with various companies, said Johnson, a partner with Kenneth Leventhal 
&amp; Co., an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
After examining 15 transactions for which Lincoln claimed $135 million, "I felt 
no profits should be booked," the accountant said. The buyers "did not have 
sufficient cash" in the properties purchased from Lincoln, he said. The buyer 
"has to have his own cash in the deal," and if the market goes bad, he will 
still be "motivated to complete the deal," according to the accountant. 
</P>
<P>
One of Lincoln's main land projects, the Hidden Valley ranch in an undeveloped 
section of Maricopa County west of Phoenix, is unlikely to be developed for the 
remainder of the century, Johnson testified. Lincoln bought the land at an 
average price of $3,000 an acre in 1985 and 1986, and began selling it at 
$16,000 an acre in 1987 and 1988, the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson described the complex transactions enabling Lincoln to record hefty 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, Lincoln had an appraisal on 1,000 acres of its Hidden Valley 
property saying the land was worth $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31, Lincoln sold the land to Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; 
Investment, or Westcon, for $14 million and recorded a profit of $11 million. 
Lincoln received a $3.5-million cash down payment and a note for $10.5 million 
from Westcon, a company that originally had a net worth of $30,000 and assets 
of $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
How could the buyer, Westcon, "service that type of debt?" Johnson wondered. 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, a day before the land sale to Westcon, Lincoln loaned $19 million 
in cash to E. C. Garcia Co., a Tucson development firm. E. C. Garcia, in turn, 
gave a $3.5-million loan to Westcon, providing the cash needed as down payment 
for buying the Hidden Valley land from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Westcon "was operating as a straw buyer . . . (with) none of their own cash 
involved," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, E. C. Garcia Co. assumed the $10.5-million note owed by Westcon 
to Lincoln. "I can find no evidence there was ever a payment by Westcon or 
Garcia on the $10.5-million note," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The accountant described another deal in which Lincoln sold $6 million worth of 
land to Hidden Valley Limited Partnership. The partnership "was basically a 
shell set up with $100 in capital," Johnson said, using funds transmitted 
through a series of transactions from American Continental.

TANKERS ARE CHEAPEST WAY TO SHIP OFFSHORE OIL -- STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As oil from a ruptured tanker laps at the beaches of Orange County, a final 
study released Friday supports Chevron Corp.'s argument that it would be 
cheaper to ship crude oil by tanker from its Point Arguello offshore project 
than by pipeline or other means. 
</P>
<P>
The study, completed by consultants Arthur D. Little Inc. for Santa Barbara 
County, concludes that it would cost $2.55 to $2.65 a barrel for tankers to 
carry oil to Los Angeles from the $2-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
Three drilling platforms were built off the Santa Barbara County coast and 
other aspects of the project were completed two years ago. But no oil has been 
produced, and regulators continue to wrangle over the transportation issue. 
</P>
<P>
Options other than using tankers -- including shipping the oil by various 
combinations of pipelines and rail routes -- could cost between $2.85 and $6.25 
per barrel according to the $400,000 study, which was commissioned by the 
county and paid for by Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Tanker opponents -- including environmental groups and pipeline operators -- 
argued that the study underestimated the costs of using tankers and 
overestimated the costs of pipeline shipment. 
</P>
<P>
Even if tankering is cheaper, Chevron "should bear some of the expense for 
being environmentally safer," said Carole Ann Cole, spokeswoman for Get Oil 
Out, a local group opposed to the use of tankers. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron was pleased with the findings. But spokesman G. Michael Marcy did not 
expect any quick decision on the company's request for a tanker permit -- 
particularly in the wake of the Orange County spill. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted as part of the county's process of reviewing a permit 
request by Chevron to tanker oil from the project, which is owned by a 
consortium of 18 oil companies. An earlier permit was revoked by the state 
Coastal Commission after protests from community groups.

CARNATION PULLS AD ACCOUNT FROM OGILVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carnation, one of the West Coast's largest packaged-goods companies, has 
decided to repackage its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The company said Friday that it will consolidate much of its advertising with 
several advertising agencies owned by the giant New York holding company, 
Interpublic Group. In Los Angeles, an account valued at $12 million to $15 
million will go from Ogilvy &amp; Mather to McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dailey &amp; Associates, the Los Angeles agency that also creates ads for 
several Carnation products, will not be affected by the changes -- at least for 
the time being. But advertising executives speculated Friday that this may be 
just the beginning to a major overhaul of Carnation's advertising nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to realign our advertising strategy to focus on fewer agencies," said 
Richard Curd, a Carnation spokesman. The company is following the lead of 
Nestle, which owns Carnation Co. "This in no way reflects dissatisfaction with 
Ogilvy's past performance," Curd said. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation is one of the few major packaged-goods companies headquartered on the 
West Cost. Because packaged-goods makers are often such large and visible 
advertisers, their accounts are coveted. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most familiar ads that Ogilvy has created for Carnation are for its 
Contadina Fresh Pasta and Fresh Sauces. Those commercials, which show the 
pasta's expiration date stamped on the package, say: Our days are numbered, but 
we wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's darned unfortunate to do a great job for a client and then have the 
larger corporate goals of the client get in the way," said Gerald McGee, 
general manager of Ogilvy's Los Angeles office, regarding the loss of the 
account it handled for about three years. "They want to consolidate, and we got 
stung by it." 
</P>
<P>
McGee, whose office recently won the coveted Paramount Pictures advertising 
business, said there will not be any layoffs resulting from the loss of the 
Carnation business. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the big winner is McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles, which will not only 
create ads for the pasta lines, but also for Grand Gourmet dog food, and for 
two lines of Carnation infant formula, Good Start and Good Nature. 
</P>
<P>
"We're absolutely thrilled," said Jim Surmanek, senior vice president at 
McCann. He said the agency will hire more staff once the extent of the new 
business is clearer.

jail system to civilian leadership is so "inaccurate and misleading" that its 
conclusions are questionable, Sheriff John Duffy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to grand jury Foreman J. Phil Franklin, Duffy complained that 
the report is replete with "errors, misinterpretation and misunderstanding" of 
how the county jail system functions. Duffy's letter describes the report as 
"superficial at best, inaccurate and misleading at worst . . . (with) no 
resolutions to the major problems affecting our jails." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy commended the grand jury for recognizing that the jail system's biggest 
problems are a lack of funds, an overworked force and a lack of space for 
inmates. However, "nowhere in the remainder of the report does the grand jury 
address these concerns . . . except to recommend the creation of a Department 
of Corrections under a civilian director." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely disappointed in the lack of the jury's depth of understanding of 
this important issue," Duffy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury report, released Tuesday, is based on a seven-month study of the 
jail system, which Duffy supervises, as well as interviews with officials in 
counties where jail inmates are supervised by a civilian-run department. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that a civilian system staffed by specially trained -- and 
lower-paid -- corrections officers would trim jail operating costs and reduce 
inmate tensions that often boil over into riots and escape attempts. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Leon Williams, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, said the 
report describes the jail system "as we understand the situation to be." 
Williams, who had not seen Duffy's letter, maintained that civilian control 
over the jails would "provide the efficiencies and economies . . . that the 
Board of Supervisors has the obligation to provide to taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not related to the sheriff's office or who the sheriff is," 
Williams said. "In my mind, it has to do with the efficiencies and economics 
that appear to be linked to a Department of Corrections." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's letter hits hard at the grand jury's suggestion that civilian-run jails 
staffed by corrections officers are cheaper and more effective to operate. The 
jury relied heavily on reviews of civilian departments in counties such as 
Santa Clara in the Bay Area, which has saved $6 million since it first hired 
correctional officers 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy maintained that the grand jury failed to recognize that Santa Clara 
County has a $78-million budget to care for 3,800 inmates at five facilities 
that are at 95% of capacity, whereas San Diego houses about 5,000 inmates in 11 
facilities that are at 173% of capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy took issue with the grand jury's contention that he has too many deputy 
sheriffs and not enough lower-paid corrections deputy officers working at the 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
"It is expected that by July, 1990, the percentage of corrections deputy 
sheriffs assigned to the jails will be about 40%" higher than it now is, he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy also questioned the wisdom of the grand jury's willingness to turn 
control of the jails over to a force consisting almost totally of lower-paid 
corrections deputy officers. The grand jury seems to be "interested only in 
cost savings resulting from paying the lowest wage possible and not sound 
operational planning based on demonstrated need, consideration of policy 
issues, liability concerns, facility security and other issues." 
</P>
<P>
He also questioned why the grand jury wants to put more professional 
corrections officers in San Diego's jails. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the grand jury is misinformed about the nature of the 
corrections officer's job," Duffy wrote. "Jails are not correctional 
institutions, and security officers who work in jails are not employed for 
correctional purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy questioned why the grand jury is pressing him to consider incorporating 
the practice of "direct supervision," in which jail personnel mingle with 
inmates rather than watching them from isolated booths. Direct supervision "is 
not a new concept and, in fact, is used to varying degrees in San Diego county 
jails," Duffy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Williams urged county supervisors to place an issue on the 
June ballot that would let county residents determine if San Diego should turn 
control of its rapidly growing jail population over to a Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, county staff members will present supervisors with the results of a 
study designed to determine whether a civilian department would be more 
cost-effective than the current system.

ROMANIA INTERIM COUNCIL VOTES TO EXPAND

<P>
The Council of National Unity, formed to give all registered political parties 
a say in governing Romania until the May elections, held its first meeting 
Friday and decided to expand itself by a third to 241 members. 
</P>
<P>
Interim President Ion Iliescu, who led organizational talks in the former 
National Assembly building, apparently will lead the council, but no formal 
vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly building is being used for the first time since the uprising 
against Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and 
executed with his wife, Elena, on Christmas Day. It also is the first time 
since the revolution that opposition groups have had a role in leadership. 
</P>
<P>
After heated debate on whether new organizations representing ethnic minorities 
should be admitted, the council voted to expand its size from 180 to 241. A 
statement issued later said some delegates wanted the new groups limited to 
observer status. 
</P>
<P>
As envisaged in the original 180-seat council, political parties and the 
non-party bloc each were to get 90 seats. 
</P>
<P>
In the expanded 241-seat Council agreed upon Friday, 105 seats will go to 35 
parties. Nine organizations representing ethnic minorities will get 27 seats, 
three will go to former political prisoners and 106 are assigned to prominent 
Romanians who were part of the National Salvation Front.

STUDY REJECTS BROWN FIELD AS NEW AIRPORT SITE; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: FOCUS SHIFTS TO MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION AS THE MOST PROMISING 
ALTERNATIVE. 
</P>

<P>
Brown Field could not be used as a major international airport because the 
nearby San Ysidro Mountains would dictate much steeper takeoffs and landings 
than normal, a new Sandag study obtained Friday by The Times concludes. 
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by the city of San Diego, evaluated the possibility of 
building a commercial airport at Brown Field. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, San Diego Assn. of Governments special projects director, who has 
been overseeing the search for a new international airport site, said Friday: 
"It is our consultants' conclusion that it is not feasible to use Brown Field 
as an airport." 
</P>
<P>
That finding, however, clearly provides an answer to the airport dilemma, 
according to Councilman Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the conclusion of every study over the last 20 years," Filner 
said. "And this one just validated it once again. We're back to where we 
started. . . . The only space available is Miramar (Naval Air Station). 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that's a real problem with the Navy, but I think we have to enter 
negotiations with the Navy at every level to get access to their facilities. 
The Navy has more than just Miramar . . . they have five sites in San Diego 
County. Surely, by looking at all those sites, somehow we can find some sort of 
a solution." 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials have repeatedly stated that they have no intention of leaving 
Miramar, and that it is unfeasible to share it with commercial aircraft. Mixing 
commercial and military operations would be dangerous, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Filner, however, said he is undeterred by the Navy's position. Meanwhile, he 
called for the immediate implementation of the San Diego Unified Port 
District's plans to make Lindbergh Field safer, yet capable of handling more 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that's not a great solution, but it will allow us to meet our needs 
for the next two decades, until we can find another site or until Miramar 
becomes available," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego spent more than $400,000 for the Brown Field report and a 
December, 1989, Sandag study that listed three sites -- Miramar, Miramar East 
(West Sycamore Canyon) and Otay Mesa -- as possible sites for an international 
airport if Lindbergh Field was close. 
</P>
<P>
The search for a new site and plans to augment Lindbergh Field have been 
debated for nearly two decades, yet no immediate solution is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Some City Council members have called for a "multiple airport" solution and 
hoped that the study would show that Brown Field could handle commercial 
aircraft and alleviate dangerous crowding at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
But the study ruled out such an option, eliminating yet another site for an 
international airport -- which nearly all local officials agree is critically 
needed. Local economists have stated that the lack of an adequate airport will 
severely limit the economic growth of the region. 
</P>
<P>
Filner's recommendation and the Sandag study's conclusion were not welcomed by 
Councilman Ron Roberts, who has opposed any plans to expand Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the conclusion, but I don't necessarily agree with it," said Paul 
Grasso, chief of staff for Roberts. "We've had other consultants tell us 
different, that they can develop an approach at Brown Field that's better than 
what's available at Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what Ron would like to do is find out what they're basing their 
conclusions on and ask them questions about their conclusion. I think Ron will 
have a lot of questions." 
</P>
<P>
The study states that "the terrain would require either much 
steeper-than-normal approach angles or much shorter-than-normal final 
approaches into the runways from the east." The mountains would also require 
"much steeper-than-normal departure climb gradients than would normally be 
acceptable to air carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating such a conclusion, County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, along with 
Supervisor Leon Williams, led the board earlier this week to approve a motion 
directing the county staff to work with Sandag and the Navy to find a way to 
use Miramar for commercial and military aviation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a situation now where there is no other option but to move Lindbergh 
Field to Miramar," Bilbray said. "There have been people who have been trying 
to figure a way to shove an airport into Brown Field. Right from the start, 
because of the mountains, I could have told you that that's like trying to 
stuff 10 pounds of wool into a 5-pound bag."

BROWN DROPS KIDNAP SUIT AGAINST PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ginger Brown, who was the prosecution's key witness in a criminal trial that 
ended with charges of kidnaping, false imprisonment and assault and battery 
against her parents, sister and others being dismissed, has dropped her own, 
$2.75-million civil lawsuit against them. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's dismissal was recorded Thursday in Superior Court, and word reached her 
parents and others Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted, for sure. I'm pleased beyond words," said Dorothy Brown who, 
with her husband, Earle, were said by attorneys to be the first parents in the 
country to be charged with the kidnaping and false imprisonment of an adult 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown filed her civil suit one day short of a year after she was taken 
from a parking lot in Encinitas to an Escondido home where, for five days in 
May, 1988, deprogrammer Cliff Daniels tried to persuade her to sever her 
allegiance to a small religious organization known as Great Among the Nations, 
which her parents believed was a cult. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney filed criminal charges against Earle and Dorothy Brown, 
both 58, of Santa Cruz; Holly Brown, 25, one of their other daughters; Daniels, 
35, of Los Angeles, and Hank Erler, 23, in whose mother's Escondido home the 
deprogramming effort occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Although Earle Brown admitted in courtroom testimony that he and others took 
Ginger Brown in a deprogramming effort, defense attorneys argued that the 
daughter had baited her parents to take her so she could later sue them for 
monetary damages. The filing of the civil lawsuit, the attorneys argued, lent 
credence to that theory. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Ginger Brown said she intended to drop the civil lawsuit 
against her parents and the others, but, to the trial's end, the civil action 
remained active -- a fact that was known to the Superior Court jury deciding 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted some of the defendants of some of the charges but was 
deadlocked on the most serious. Superior Court Judge David B. Moon Jr. then 
dismissed the case altogether, saying it never should have been brought to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the district attorney's office said Friday that no decision has 
yet been made on whether to appeal Moon's decision that the case cannot be 
refiled. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, on Thursday, Brown, now 24, signed the necessary 
document to dismiss her civil lawsuit. She could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But her mother said she was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how we could have physically, emotionally, financially or any 
other way have gone through another trial," Dorothy Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Brown's attorney in the civil action, Caryle Christianson, had removed 
herself from the case last month and declined comment on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys involved in the Browns' defense suggested Friday that 
Christianson dropped the case because she took it on contingency and saw little 
likelihood that the civil action would prevail, especially in the wake of the 
criminal charges being dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Saul Wright, Earle Brown's defense attorney, said he was "relieved but not 
surprised" by the dismissal. "It was a bad lawsuit from the beginning. I'm sure 
when they saw the reaction of our jury, they concluded it wouldn't be worth 
pursuing." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit named not only each of the five people who faced the criminal 
charges, but others including former members of Great Among the Nations who met 
with Ginger Brown during the deprogramming effort to try to get her to renounce 
her allegiance to the group, which claims to be a fundamental Christian Bible 
study group and television evangelism ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that the defendants were guilty of negligent supervision and 
intentional infliction of emotional distress.

HUNTER'S LAWYERS SEEK RETRIAL, WANT CASE MOVED OUT OF SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, who was convicted in December on federal charges of tax 
evasion, deserves a new trial because a jury found her guilty of a phantom tax 
law, and the judge who presided over her case improperly pressured the jury, 
her lawyers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In legal briefs filed with the San Diego federal court, Hunter's lawyers also 
asked that a new trial be moved to San Francisco. Hunter can't get a fair trial 
in San Diego because there's been so much publicity about her case, defense 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, convicted after an eight-month trial of four of 197 counts, is already 
set to face a second trial next month on the remaining 192 counts, primarily 
dealing with fraud and conspiracy charges stemming from her role as a top 
executive in the failed La Jolla investment firm J. David &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's lawyers contended Friday that she should be tried again on the four 
tax evasion charges because, after what is believed to be the longest criminal 
case in the history of the San Diego federal court, she was wrongly convicted 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Convicted on Dec. 11, Hunter, 51, a former Del Mar mayor, faces up to 20 years 
in prison. Immediately following her conviction, U.S. District Judge Earl B. 
Gilliam ordered Hunter to jail while she awaits her sentencing on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
The jury acquitted Hunter of one other tax charge but deadlocked on the 192 
counts stemming from her purported involvement in a Ponzi scheme run by the J. 
David firm from 1979 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors alleged that Hunter created false documents both to lure 
investors to J. David and then to lull them into staying put while the firm 
slid toward bankruptcy. Investors lost about $80 million in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The four tax counts involved thousands of dollars that Hunter received from her 
lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, but did not report on her 
personal income tax forms for the years 1980 to 1983. At trial, Hunter said 
Dominelli, now serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison for fraud and tax 
evasion, told her that she should not consider the money income to her and that 
he would be responsible for any tax on it. 
</P>
<P>
When the jury got the case, "one or two other jurors" told juror John Posey, 
44, of National City, that, even if the money from Dominelli was a gift, the 
law still was that she had to pay the tax on any amount over $10,000, defense 
lawyers said Friday in their briefs. 
</P>
<P>
That was not what Gilliam had told the jury the law was and, besides, it was 
not an accurate statement because no such law exists, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
However, because of what he was told, Posey switched his vote from not guilty 
to guilty on each of the four counts, he said in a sworn statement filed with 
the lawyers' briefs. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked, 11 to 1, in favor of conviction on the 192 fraud and 
conspiracy counts. Posey was the lone holdout. 
</P>
<P>
The panel originally was split over those counts, Posey said in his statement. 
After six days of deliberations, though, Gilliam told the panel that it "should 
have reached a verdict by now." 
</P>
<P>
Though the judge retracted that statement the next day, "the damage was done," 
Posey said. "I think that jurors who were looking for a way out of the 
deliberations then saw that the easiest way out was to side with the jurors who 
were voting guilty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time that Judge Gilliam retracted his statement, it was too late to 
stop this momentum," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Posey's remarks, defense attorneys said Gilliam's "unwarranted 
intervention had the disastrous effect of coercing a verdict." 
</P>
<P>
In asking that the second trial be moved to San Francisco, the lawyers said the 
public had been "literally bombarded on almost a daily basis with articles" 
about the first trial, from last March to last December. 
</P>
<P>
Because of press attention, "it is now impossible" for Hunter to get a fair 
trial in San Diego, the attorneys charged. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers told Gilliam before the first trial that it should be moved 
because of extensive publicity. He denied that request.

ALL 3 RAIL PLANS RECOMMENDED IN PLANNERS' REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: THE FINDINGS ARE INDICATIVE OF INTENSE LOBBYING FOR AND AGAINST THE 
PLANS. THE COUNTY WILL CHOOSE ONE OF THE OPTIONS, POSSIBLY AS SOON AS FEB. 28. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unwilling to choose from among three rival San Fernando Valley rail plans, mass 
transit planners on Friday gave their recommendation to all three, setting the 
stage for a decisive battle in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended plans are an extension of the Metro Rail subway from North 
Hollywood to the San Diego Freeway, a light-rail line in a shallow trench from 
North Hollywood to Warner Center and an elevated rail line along the Ventura 
Freeway from Universal City to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited report by professional rail planners now goes to the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is scheduled to choose one of 
the options, possibly as early as Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's staff recommendations show the effects of intensive lobbying 
in recent weeks by elected officials on behalf of two of the plans. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway elevated line and the Metro Rail extension, both of which have 
prominent advocates and well-organized opponents, have been altered in recent 
weeks to make them less expensive and easier to build. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-member commission, which is building a countywide network of rail lines, 
has given no clear signal on how it might vote on the competing plans. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the picture is the fact that in addition to the dueling Valley 
plans, the commission has pitted the Valley against two other areas for the 
next rail line, which planners say will be the last to be built locally in this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
In competition with the Valley are proposed light-rail lines from El Segundo to 
Marina del Rey and from downtown Los Angeles through northeast Los Angeles to 
Pasadena, both of which have strong political backing on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, county supervisors on Tuesday placed the three Valley rail 
alternatives recommended in the staff report Friday on the June 5 ballot, a 
move that could further complicate the route-selection process. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley proposal with the greatest support is the 5.6-mile extension of the 
downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro Rail subway to the San Diego Freeway along 
the Southern Pacific freight right-of-way that parallels Chandler and Victory 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
The route traverses numerous residential neighborhoods and has ignited fierce 
opposition from homeowner groups. 
</P>
<P>
However, the subway extension, proposed last May by state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, has brought together 
warring homeowners and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders gave up their drive for a line that would reach all the way to 
Warner Center. In exchange, many, but not all, homeowner leaders dropped their 
firm opposition to any line that intrudes in single-family areas. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said Friday that he remains "confident that it is the only plan that 
will work." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged having a hand in key changes in the subway plan that pruned 
$200 million from the $1.3-billion cost estimate the staff presented at public 
hearings in December. 
</P>
<P>
He said the cost savings were achieved by halting the line at the San Diego 
Freeway rather than Balboa Boulevard, moving the North Hollywood station from 
Chandler and Lankershim boulevards to Chandler and Tujunga Avenue and 
eliminating a proposed rail maintenance yard in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Commission sources said that while Robbins and other subway advocates were 
massaging their proposal in recent weeks, Supervisor Mike Antonovich also was 
reshaping his rival plan for an elevated monorail along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the supervisor, who contends that only a futuristic monorail system 
will lure motorists from their cars, have reduced the estimated cost of a 
16.5-mile line spanning the Valley by about $300 million from the $2.1-billion 
cost projected in December. 
</P>
<P>
County public works planners, acting at Antonovich's behest, recently secured 
an important concession from the state Department of Transportation that would 
allow pillars supporting an elevated line to be placed between on- and 
off-ramps and the freeway lanes, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
According to commission executive director Neil Peterson, that change in 
alignment reduces to 20 the number of houses to be demolished for a freeway 
rail line. Previous estimates ranged from 200 to 500 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the lowered cost estimate was acceptance by the commission 
staff of a proposal that parking lots could be built on the north side of the 
freeway with rail passengers walking under the freeway lanes to board trains. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans has insisted that the north shoulder of the freeway be left available 
for a possible upper deck, which is under study. 
</P>
<P>
The third alternative -- light rail in a shallow trench along the Southern 
Pacific right of way -- has been a staff favorite throughout the three-year 
study of Valley rail alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Such a light-rail system could be built from North Hollywood to Warner Center 
for $1.1 billion, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
While that plan initially enjoyed strong support among business groups, most 
such advocates abandoned it in favor of the Robbins-Braude subway plan. 
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Silver, a leader of the North Hollywood-based Eastern Sector Transit 
Coalition, said Friday that his group, which never endorsed the Robbins-Braude 
plan, was organizing to make a strong showing against both plans that use the 
Southern Pacific right of way. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect hundreds to attend to argue that neither plan is acceptable," he 
said. "We don't trust the commission. They will get the route established, then 
because of financial considerations the plan will be modified to surface rail." 
</P>
<P>
The staff report will first be aired at 9 a.m. Wednesday at a meeting in Los 
Angeles of the commission's five-member Transit Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is expected to make a recommendation to the full commission, 
which meets Feb. 28.

ROCKWELL OFFERS TOURS OF LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International is inviting residents of the San Fernando, Simi and 
Conejo valleys to tour its Santa Susana Field Laboratory on Feb. 17, company 
officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
Bus tours are scheduled for 8 a.m., 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., with each expected to 
last about 2 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Each tour will include a stop at a conference room for a question-and-answer 
session and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
The tours are restricted to non-employees 15 years of age and older, and 
admittance will be by reservation only. Those wishing to sign up for a tour can 
reserve one or two seats by calling (818) 710-2791 weekdays between 9 a.m. and 
4 p.m, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,668-acre field lab west of Chatsworth, run by Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
division, has been used for rocket testing and nuclear research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the company has come under heavy criticism from environmental 
and homeowner activists because of chemical and low-level radioactive 
contamination at the field laboratory. Company officials said the tour is part 
of its effort to persuade neighbors that the field lab poses no danger.

FESTIVITIES FALTER AS VISTA STEPS BACK TO THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was to have been a grand display of computerized convenience: North County 
residents can now avoid a long drive to San Diego and instead go to the Vista 
courthouse to get, by way of state-of-the-art technology, certified copies of 
birth, death and marriage certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Wowzers! A computer terminal is linked to the mother computer in San Diego -- 
where more than 1.5 million birth, death and marriage certificates are on 
computer file. And a state-of-the-art laser printer is set up in Vista, so the 
record can be officially reprinted in, say, three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor John MacDonald was there. So was County Recorder Vera Lyle and 
County Clerk Robert Zumwalt and a bunch of other high-ranking bureaucrats 
looking sharp in their dark-blue power suits. There was a county photographer, 
a ribbon to cut, even the first customer in line, wanting her son's birth 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk sat at the keyboard and typed in the appropriate code. The screen 
remained blank. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the next 40 minutes, the screen stayed that way, blank. Clerks punched 
in different letters and codes on the keyboard. Lyle, ribbon-cutting scissors 
still in hand, fidgeted with a cable. Someone else turned the machine off, and 
on, and off, and on again. 
</P>
<P>
Blank screen. 
</P>
<P>
Two high-ranking managers each got on separate telephones to computer 
technicians in San Diego. They talked about mainframes and host computers and 
how the whole system was "down." 
</P>
<P>
Lyle fidgeted some more with the cable. 
</P>
<P>
The customer was handed a piece of paper to fill out her request the 
old-fashioned way, just in case. "We can mail her the certificate in a day or 
so," a bureaucrat grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle fidgeted some more with the cable. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the computer screen came on. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, a courthouse electrician moseyed into the Superior 
Court clerk's office in Vista and saw all the commotion. He walked over to the 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked for 40 minutes," someone sighed to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Huh? 
</P>
<P>
"I had all the computers 'down' so I could work on the controllers," he said, 
speaking computer-talk. "I was doing something for the marshal's office. It was 
on the log, that the computers would be down." 
</P>
<P>
"But we had this big ceremony today!" a bureaucrat in a nice suit moaned. 
</P>
<P>
"No one told me," the computer tech said. 
</P>
<P>
Georginne Smith finally got her son's laser-printed birth certificate and 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle, the county recorder smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Annette Evans, the chief deputy county recorder, smiled. Last year countywide, 
she said, 83,000 copies of records were made -- and more than 20,000 will 
probably be made in Vista this year for people who don't want to drive to 
downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But call first and make sure the computers aren't down.

SCHOOLCHILDREN SHOW VOLUMINOUS APPETITE IN 7-WEEK BINGE ON BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Maybe Johnny can't read. But Dylan can. So can James and Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
So when the call went out in November, those three -- along with 800 or so of 
their Carpenter Avenue School mates -- were ready to put their skills to work. 
Their task: to read as much as they could in a seven-week "read-a-thon." 
</P>
<P>
Squeezing a quarter or two out of mom and dad for every book they read, the 
children at the Studio City school brought in more than $9,000. World Book, the 
encyclopedia publishers, chipped in $6,000, bringing the total to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
That money was used to buy more books: 17 new 22-volume sets of encyclopedias. 
Those new sets mean each of Carpenter's 27 classrooms has its own, something a 
World Book official said no other school in the nation can claim. 
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia company runs similar "read-a-thons" at schools across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
New encyclopedias may not be on every third-grader's top 10 list of nifty 
stuff, but at an awards ceremony Friday, the kids at Carpenter seemed to take 
pride in their sets. After all, they earned them. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an incredible thing that you've done," Claude Swonger, district manager 
for World Book, told the semicircle of schoolchildren who sat cross-legged on 
the blacktop. "You were the ones who put your noses between the pages and 
read." 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, the children said they found that reading was kind of fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I like stuff in space and in stars," said third-grader Boyd Cooper, whose 
friends call him B.J. "My favorite planet is Saturn. I like to read about 
Saturn." 
</P>
<P>
As far as the encyclopedias went, Cooper said he could use them to look up 
information about gems and coins, two things he's developed an interest in 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedias already have come in handy. Teacher Wendy Raksin said her 
class looked up the entry on Braille after a question came up during a story 
about how dogs help the blind. 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Sculley, 9, finished off 10 books in seven weeks. Among his favorites was 
a book detailing the process of milk production. You know, how milk is 
pasteurized and "homogized" after it comes out of the cow. 
</P>
<P>
His friend, 8-year-old James Duffey, said he read 16 books, most of them about 
whales. But his reading skill was not what James wanted the world to know about 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat parts of my shoe," he said, shoving a piece of white rubber into his 
mouth.

PALMDALE MAY TRY TO TURN VACANT PENNEY'S STORE INTO LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The old J.C. Penney building in downtown Palmdale, due to be vacated this fall 
when the store moves to a new regional mall, could be renovated into an 
expanded city library by early next year under a plan adopted this week by the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to open negotiations to buy or lease the 32-year-old 
building from its owner, a partnership headed by Reseda businessman Melvyn 
Starkman. The Penney's building would nearly triple the space of the city's now 
13-year-old library. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the city had been planning to renovate and expand the 
12,000-square-foot library at 700 E. Palmdale Blvd. to meet the demands of a 
growing population. But city officials recently dropped those plans after bids 
for the project came back in excess of $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
For that price, the Spanish-style library would have been expanded by only 
3,000 square feet. City officials have estimated that the cost of upgrading 
Penney's building, which has 31,000 square, at $775,000, not including purchase 
or lease costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about the prospect if we are able to follow through on this," said 
Linda Storsteen, Palmdale city librarian. She said the Penney building is large 
enough, just a few blocks from the current library in a central location and 
has ample parking. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, city officials acknowledged, they have yet to closely inspect the 
building, which is at 38548 Sierra Highway. Although it does have fire 
sprinklers, city officials said, the possibility of asbestos removal and 
structural upgrades could substantially increase the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Storsteen called it "the only building big enough in town to really service our 
needs." The librarian said she had been thinking of the building as a potential 
library well before the J.C. Penney Co. announced plans to move into the 
Antelope Valley Mall, which is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
The current library, near City Hall and the first building built by the city, 
would be converted to some other municipal use, Storsteen said.

Criminal charges will not be filed against a school bus driver who blacked out 
and crashed into a video store Wednesday, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wykowski, 39, told an officer that he had been treated for epileptic 
seizures about 10 years ago, CHP spokesman Jerry Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
Wykowski said his driver's license was suspended during the treatment period. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication on his medical records," Bohrer said. "If it had shown 
up, he wouldn't have qualified for driving school buses." 
</P>
<P>
Wykowski failed to mention his condition, and the application for a bus 
operator's certificate does not request such information, Bohrer said. However, 
a medical form asks employees if they have had epileptic seizures. 
</P>
<P>
When Wykowski's medical record was updated in August, he answered no to the 
epileptic seizure question, Bohrer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears he wasn't truthful," Bohrer said. "If he didn't tell the doctor, 
there's no way the doctor can know." 
</P>
<P>
Bohrer said the CHP has requested the suspension of Wykowski's bus driver 
certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Wykowski, who told investigators that he doesn't remember the crash, is 
undergoing tests at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where he is in 
stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
A driver for Mark IV Charter, Wykowski was transporting 11 children to 
Fairbanks Ranch Country Day School. The children suffered minor injuries.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER COUNCIL RACE DROPS TO 16 CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The field of candidates seeking three Lancaster City Council seats has narrowed 
from 18 to 16 after two would-be contenders failed to submit enough valid 
petition signatures to qualify for the April 10 ballot, a city official said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Carla Johnson said Mike Dansand, a 63-year-old retired engineer, and 
Barbara Kent, a 19-year-old restaurant employee, came up short of the 
requirement that candidates submit signatures of 20 people registered to vote 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Their failure to qualify still left 16 candidates, the most in years, seeking 
the three at-large council seats. Mayor Lynn Harrison and Councilman Els Groves 
did not seek reelection, leaving two vacant seats. Councilman Arnie Rodio filed 
to keep his seat for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the two would-be candidates were disqualified after a check showed 
Dansand with only 18 valid signatures and Kent with only 15. Each had 
signatures from people who were not registered to vote, who were not registered 
at their current address or who lived outside the city.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIRPORT PANEL LOOKS AT PALMDALE SOLAR PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners said he wants his 
panel to consider permitting development of a major solar power plant on vacant 
airport-owned land in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Airport commission President Jerry Epstein said he will propose that airport 
officials consider allowing the world's largest solar energy producer to use as 
many as "a few thousand" acres of the nearly 18,000 acres of airport land in 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The Westwood-based company, Luz International Ltd., made a presentation to 
airport officials last month asking for land on which to build a $1-billion 
solar energy plant in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
At that time Epstein and other airport officials said in interviews they 
doubted the plan would be approved. But Epstein later said The Times' report of 
the meeting, under the headline "Airport Officials Reject Major Solar Energy 
Plant on Palmdale Site," left the incorrect impression that the commission had 
made a final decision against it. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said he will ask the board to consider the plan at its Feb. 21 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles airport officials have been saving the land, most of which is 
vacant, for a long-planned regional airport. But Epstein said Los Angeles, 
which currently gets no solar power, also ought to consider opportunities to 
develop cleaner sources of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the technology. Why not use it," said Epstein, who also heads a 
city-county energy commission. Luz has proposed a city-financed facility that 
could provide 10% of Los Angeles' energy needs. The company already operates 
several solar plants in the Mojave Desert.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly two years, there are finally settlements of two lawsuits brought 
against Santa Ana over its policy of confiscating and discarding the personal 
property of homeless people who sleep in the city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
The city settled one of the cases by agreeing to pay 14 homeless people a total 
of $50,000. That should give them a financial stake big enough to find 
themselves a place to live. But the agreement in the other lawsuit is more 
far-reaching, because it establishes more humane policies for dealing with the 
possessions of those for whom a park bench still is home. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, the city will no longer conduct large-scale 
"maintenance" sweeps of city parks. Instead, crews will conduct routine 
cleanups that will allow the homeless to collect their belongings and move on. 
In addition, items that are confiscated will be kept at a storage facility at 
Eddy West Stadium near the Civic Center area, where many homeless spend nights 
after storing their belongings during the day. Previously, confiscated items 
were tossed out or stored at a place across town that made recovery difficult. 
This is a far better solution. 
</P>
<P>
As one property-law specialist observed of the city's confiscation policy, "one 
man's trash is another man's bedroll." When the city first launched its 
confiscation program, some of the homeless lost not only bedrolls but food or 
important paper work, such as discharges from the military service. Others lost 
photographs of loved ones. "The little things we own, we like to keep them," a 
homeless man said of the belongings confiscated from him. 
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 10,000 homeless people in Orange County. Many more of 
them gather in Santa Ana than in Orange County's other 28 cities, which has 
presented city officials with a problem. But taking the few possessions of 
those with little to begin with was a cruel way to deal with the situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
Goalkeeper Jim Gorsek may have been known as "The Road Warrior" during his MISL 
career with the Sockers, but he has found home more to his liking with the 
Kansas City Comets. 
</P>
<P>
Gorsek came up with four saves in the fourth quarter Friday night, including 
three in a furious final 90 seconds, as the Comets defeated the Sockers, 4-3, 
in front of 9,614 at Kemper Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Gorsek a 7-0 record at home this season, his first in Kansas 
City, as opposed to his road record of 0-8. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, facing the Sockers didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little more special beating San Diego because I played there for so 
long," said Gorsek, who is 2-3 against the Sockers this season. "But I don't 
try to do anything different against them." 
</P>
<P>
Gorsek was at his best in the final 1:28. He robbed Steve Zungul with a foot 
save at the near post and followed by blocking a drive by Branko Segota and 
deflecting Brian Quinn's rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"He stayed at the near post, and he guessed it right," said Zungul, who was 
playing in his first game since Dec. 10. "It hit him right on the toe. I tried 
to flick it over him, but he was there." 
</P>
<P>
Gorsek knew just where Zungul was when the shot was taken. 
</P>
<P>
"All I saw was the ball coming across," Gorsek said, "and as I turned my head I 
saw some blue shorts. I said, 'Oh no.' He hit, I hit it, it went over the top. 
Just a reaction save." 
</P>
<P>
The victory snapped a three-game losing streak for the Comets, who are 14-16, 
including 11-3 at Kemper Arena. The Sockers, who had won two consecutively, 
fell to 13-16, including a 3-11 road record. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they need "The Road Warrior" to return. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy played a good game," Socker Coach Ron Newman said. "When we were 
rotating goalkeepers, he always ended up with a road game. In those days, we 
were winning at home and on the road, so it didn't make any difference." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Sockers' current road problems, defender Kevin Crow said, "I think 
it takes hard work on the road. That's not real conducive to our team. The 
league is getting more and more physical, and there's more and more running 
involved. It's starting to hurt the teams that want to play more of a finesse 
style." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers never could get a handle on this game. After Rod Castro's 
power-play goal from Zungul 8:51 into the third period tied the score at 3-3, 
Kansas City's Dave Boncek scored his second goal of the game 13:31 into the 
period to win it. 
</P>
<P>
But most critical as far as the Sockers were concerned was a shot Crow put in 
his own goal to give Kansas City a 3-2 lead 5:23 into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City defender Kim Roentved, from deep in his own end, hit a long drive 
into the Sockers penalty area; the ball glazed off the head of forward Jan 
Goossens and ricocheted off the glass behind the goal. Crow intended to play it 
back to goalkeeper Victor Nogueria, but Nogueria had come off the line to 
contest Goossens, so Crow's pass trickled into the goal. Goossens was credited 
with the goal, his 23rd of the season and the 150th of his career with the 
Comets. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a culmination of mistakes," Crow said of the play. "Victor made a poor 
decision coming out, and I made a poor decision. I should have just blasted it 
and kicked it out, but I tried to play it off the boards to Victor's side and 
mis-hit it and hit the corner of the post, and it went in." 
</P>
<P>
Though the Sockers tied it on Castro's goal, they didn't play with much 
intensity after the fluke goal by Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Once Kansas City took its 4-3 lead going into the fourth quarter, the Sockers 
were in trouble. Kansas City is 11-0 in games in which they've led after three 
quarters; the Sockers are 1-11 in games in which they trailed after three. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought early on we looked good," Newman said, "but we can't stay with the 
running game because we haven't got runners to do that. All the time, Kansas 
City was running, playing deep balls and running off the deep ball, and that's 
the sort of game that's killing us this year. We couldn't stay with them." 
</P>
<P>
Also hurting the Sockers' cause was a sprained ankle suffered by defender Ralph 
Black in the first quarter. Black scored on the Sockers' first shot for a 1-0 
lead after 1:08. But 41 seconds later, he collided with Kansas City's Ted Eck 
near the Socker goal, had to be helped off the field and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Donald Cogsville took a regular shift in place of Black for the rest of 
the game. Black's status for Sunday's game at Cleveland is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had 16 players on the bench, one more than league rules allow, but 
Coach Ron Newman said goalkeeper Zoltan Toth was not dressed to play and was 
merely helping with the door to the bench.

EL TORO STAYS COOL DOWN STRETCH TO END CAPISTRANO VALLEY'S REIGN

<P>
El Toro High School kept its poise, made some key free throws down the stretch, 
and in the end, claimed its first victory over rival Capistrano Valley in five 
years Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until 13 seconds remained, when guard Kevin Martin made two free 
throws, that El Toro finally ended the jinx with a 78-73 victory over the South 
Coast League champions. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (17-8 overall, 8-2 in league) had beaten El Toro 10 
consecutive times in league play going back to the second round of the 1984-85 
season. For all practical purposes, the streak ended when Capistrano Valley's 
star player, Scott McCorkle, picked up his third personal foul with 4:07 
remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle was never effective after the foul, scoring only eight points in the 
second half after scoring 12 points in a little over a quarter and a half of 
play. Guard Chris Kostoff also wasn't much of a factor, scoring 17 points but 
getting only a pair of free throws in the decisive fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much McCorkle and Kostoff scored, but I've never seen them 
work so hard for their points," said Tim Travers, El Toro coach. "It's been a 
long time since we beat them. It seemed bad things always happen to us whenever 
we play them. 
</P>
<P>
"The games have been so close, so many times. This was a great lift for us 
going into the playoffs. We're 19-5 and this was a good send-off." 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (19-5, 7-3) made 10 of 14 free throws in the final quarter, hitting 
pivotal foul shots each time Capistrano Valley got close. Forward Rob Johnson 
and guard Tim Casarez each scored 20 points for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat will be costly for Capistrano Valley entering the Southern Section 
5-A division playoffs. Capistrano Valley had a lock on the third seed before 
the loss and now will likely be seeded fourth and placed in the same bracket 
with top-ranked Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the defeat would affect his team's seeding in postseason play, Mark 
Thornton, Capistrano Valley coach, said, "I would think so." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton had little to say about the loss. 
</P>
<P>
"They just played better than we did," Thornton said as he turned and walked 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 70, San Clemente 42 -- Mike Boucher had 14 points, Greg Amaya had 
12 and Chris Cook added 10 points to lead host Mission Viejo (18-6, 8-2). Jason 
Dunahee had 11 points for San Clemente (6-18, 0-10). 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills 48, Irvine 47 -- John Molle hit two free throws with just over a 
minute left to put visiting Irvine ahead, 47-45, but Keith Barnett was fouled 
and made the front of a one-and-one to pull within one. His second shot missed 
and the rebound went out of bounds of Irvine. Chris Swenson scored the winning 
basket after an offensive rebound of Barnett's shot with eight seconds left. 
Dana Hills is 16-9, 9-1 and Irvine is 11-15, 3-6.

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

KENNEDY MEETS THE CHALLENGE WITH VICTORY OVER PACIFICA

<P>
After losing its first Garden Grove League game of the season, Kennedy High 
School Coach John Mayberry issued a challenge to his players, telling them 
their "magic number was 13." 
</P>
<P>
And despite a slow start and making only 33% of their shots from the field 
Friday night at Kennedy, the Fighting Irish met Mayberry's challenge. They 
completed league play with their 13th victory, a 55-48 triumph over Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's victory, coupled with Rancho Alamitos' 78-64 victory over Bolsa 
Grande Friday, placed the teams in a tie for the Garden Grove League 
championship. Both teams finished with 13-1 records in league play, splitting 
their two games against each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the game tonight, I told the kids that if they don't win this one, the 
other 12 don't mean anything," Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy came out tight, making only four of 15 shots in the first quarter, and 
fell behind Pacifica 15-10 after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jim Barker's game-high 25 points, 13 in the first half, kept Kennedy 
close early. The Mariners built a 26-23 halftime lead, and Mayberry gave his 
team another challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them at halftime, 'It is your championship to win, "' Mayberry said, 
"'If you want it, go and get it. I have over 200 wins and six championships 
already.' But another one is always nice." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy responded by scoring 11 points in the first two minutes of the third 
quarter, and Pacifica never threatened again. 
</P>
<P>
Center Jermaine Galloway defended the inside with eight blocks, and Barker made 
six free throws in the final two minutes to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 84, La Quinta 64 -- Forward Mark Perry scored 22 points to pace 
host Garden Grove (10-13, 8-6). Forward Joe Squires added 21 points and center 
Bob Ioja had 19 for Garden Grove. Center Justin Sogoian led La Quinta (2-20, 
2-12) with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 78, Bolsa Grande 64 -- Paul Preuss scored 21 points to lead 
Rancho Alamitos, which rallied in the second half. Bolsa Grande led at the 
half, 34-33, but Rancho Alamitos outscored Bolsa Grande, 26-20, in the third 
quarter to take the lead. Rancho Alamitos ends the regular season 20-3, 13-1. 
Hinh Bui scored 25 points for Bolsa Grande (8-13, 6-8).

MISSED FREE THROWS IN FINAL SECONDS COST LOS ALAMITOS

<P>
It was only fitting that Los Alamitos center Robert Conlisk stood at the 
free-throw line with five seconds remaining and his team trailing Esperanza by 
one point Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-10 senior already had done everything and then some, scoring 28 
points and playing dominating defense, to give the sixth-ranked Griffins a 
chance to win the regular-season finale for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
But, with some fans stomping on the bleachers and others yelling in 
anticipation in the Esperanza gym, Conlisk missed the first of two shots. He 
then missed again, allowing Esperanza to win, 68-67, and denying his team an 
undefeated Empire League record. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to be calm," said Conlisk, a 60% free-throw shooter. "Some guys go up 
there shaking and you know they're going to miss. I just missed them. It's my 
fault. I'll take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (19-6 overall, 9-1 in league play) and Esperanza (8-2, 16-10) will 
continue into the Southern Section 5-A Division playoffs next week, but 
Esperanza will carry the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they were beatable," Esperanza forward Joe Foss said. "We didn't want 
them to go through undefeated, and we wanted to get some momentum for 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk's misses made a hero of Esperanza's Brett Evans, who converted two free 
throws with 16 seconds left to give the Aztecs the 68-67 lead. Just 10 seconds 
earlier, Los Alamitos guard Jason Cunningham had put his team ahead, 67-66, 
with two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza coach Mark Hill said his team's late strategy worked perfectly. "He 
(Conlisk) is unstoppable in the post," said Hill. "We told the guys to just 
foul him when he got the ball inside. He has trouble at the line." 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 68, Loara 66 -- Forward Jerome Facione hit a 10-foot jumpshot with 
one second remaining to give host El Dorado the victory over Loara (15-7, 4-6) 
and a spot in the playoffs. He finished with 16 points in the game. Guard Mike 
Brabach led El Dorado (14-10, 5-5) in scoring with 27 points. Loara guard Tes 
Whitlock led all scorers with 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 77, Katella 60 -- Forward Kevin Smith had a triple-double with 10 
points, 12 assists and 12 rebounds to pace host Cypress (9-15, 2-8) Friday. 
Forward Courtney Smith added 17 and guard Jared Rice scored 16 for Cypress. 
Katella dropped to 6-17 overall and 2-8 in league.

<TEXT>
<P>
Foothill High School had every reason to sleepwalk through its regular-season 
finale against Santa Ana Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights came into the half-empty gymnasium at Santa Ana as the proud owners 
of the Century League championship, having clinched the title last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill also was Orange County's ninth-ranked team and was riding a nine-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights could have turned in a forgetable performance in a meaningless 
game, but the they didn't, routing Santa Ana, 75-54. 
</P>
<P>
The victory pushed Foothill's record to 18-6 overall, 10-0 in Century League 
play. It was the first time in the school's history the Knights had gone 
undefeated in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"We went 13-1 in 1982-83," Foothill Coach Jim Reames said. "It's tough to go 
undefeated in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana had won the past four Century League titles. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Mark Wilkinson had 23 points, most on quick drives that led to layups and 
and short jump shots, to lead Foothill. Center Fred Amos added 17 and forward 
Nick Konopisos 15. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing pretty good basketball right now," Reames said. "The last few 
games, the margins have been 15 to 20 points. Hopefully, we'll get a good 
seeding, maybe one of the top four in the (Southern Section) 3-AA." 
</P>
<P>
Playoff pairings will be announced Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill led, 20-8, at the end of the first quarter and the game was never in 
doubt. By halftime, the Knights' lead grew to 38-17. 
</P>
<P>
Konopisos had nine points and Wilkinson six during the pivotal second quarter 
when Foothill outscored Santa Ana, 18-9. A 9-2 run by Foothill over the final 
4:18 of the half decided the game. 
</P>
<P>
With a victory out of reach, Santa Ana's smooth forward Chauncey Woolridge took 
the opportunity to show off his jump shot. And his drives to the basket. And 
his leaping ability. And his rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Even in defeat, it was an impressive display. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge had a game-high 25 points, missing only one of his eight shots from 
the field in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
A fade-away, eight-foot bank shot and a pretty, stop-and-go move that set up a 
fast-break layup were the most impressive of his 19 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge was the only scorer in double figures for the Saints (10-13, 5-5). 
</P>
<P>
In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
Canyon 51, El Modena 49 -- Abdi Barkhordar scored on a layin after a steal by 
Dan Bottiaux with about 40 seconds left to give Canyon a lead that held up at 
El Modena. Barkhordar had a game-high 18 points for Canyon (14-10, 7-3). Kevin 
Wilborn added 16 for Canyon. Jeff Leedom led El Modena (13-11, 5-5) with 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 58, Santa Ana Valley 55 -- Aaron Boone scored 17 points and Alex 
Vicario 11 to lead host Villa Park (3-17, 2-8) to its best league record since 
1984. George Alvarado had 26 points for Santa Ana Valley (4-16, 1-9).

Rog Middleton had a chance to tie the score for Chapman College in the final 
seconds Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time Middleton controlled a slightly errant pass, he was forced to 
take a 18-foot jump shot under pressure from three Cal State Los Angeles 
defenders. Middleton, who had been denied the ball most of the game, missed the 
shot and Chapman lost a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game, 53-51, at 
the Hutton Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive victory for Los Angeles (12-10, 5-4). Chapman 
(10-12, 2-7) has lost four in a row and six of its past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. took a two-point lead with 1 minutes 7 seconds to play and two 
seconds left on the 45-second clock when Mike Varos made a short jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Varos' shot saved the Golden Eagles from a second-half fade that allowed 
Chapman to rally after trailing, 29-20, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
A tightly packed zone defense kept the ball away from the Panthers' inside 
players, especially Middleton, who scored only five of his team-high 16 points 
in the first half. Chapman shot only 34.6% from the field in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 16 with 15:34 seconds remaining, Chapman began a fairly lethargic 
rally that cut the Golden Eagles' lead to 11 with eight minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
In the next six minutes, the Panthers went on a 14-3 run, which ended with a 
jump shot by Chris Martin to tie the score, 51-51. Martin scored 12 points, all 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
LaVarr Ball had 20 points and 11 rebounds for Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
In California Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Chapman 80, Cal State Los Angeles 77 -- Jennifer Uecke had 18 points, 10 
rebounds and eight blocked shots for host Chapman (17-6, 6-3). Julie King had 
12 points and Bethel Trice and Melissa Abraham each had 11 for Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College 94, Bethany Bible 81 -- Jeff Bickmore scored 19 to 
lead host SCC (18-70 to its ninth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton 6, Arizona 1 -- James Popoff (1-1) allowed five hits over 
seven innings for Cal State Fullerton (3-3) at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bunch hit a two-run home run, and Rich Gonzales, Tom Manley and Matt 
Hattabuagh had two hits each for Fullerton. Steve Gill, a junior transfer from 
Cypress College, had two hits for Arizona (4-6). 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona 4, UC Irvine 3 -- Jim Maguire singled in the winning run in the 
ninth for host Cal Poly Pomona (3-5). Fred Combs had two hits for Irvine (2-4). 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference men's swimming: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 89, UC Riverside 9 -- Ken Cooper won the 200-yard individual medley 
in 2 minutes 3.71 seconds and he won the 100 breaststroke (1:04.7) to lead host 
UC Irvine (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference women's swimming: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine 89, UC Riverside 9 -- Shannon Endsley won the 100 backstroke (1:06.3) 
and the 100 breaststroke (1:16.73) and Grace Moon won the 200 freestyle 
(2:02.5) and the 100 butterfly (1:04.45) for Irvine (4-8).

COLLEGE DREAM CAN BE HIGH SCHOOL NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
MOONLIGHTING: SOME COACHES WORRY THAT GOOD OFFICIALS WILL LEAVE THEM FOR THE 
COLLEGE GAME. OTHERS LAMENT THAT THESE REFEREES BRING THE COLLEGE GAME TO THE 
HIGH SCHOOLS.

<P>
Area high school basketball players aren't the only ones hoping to make the 
jump to the college level. So are high school referees. 
</P>
<P>
But they haven't just been hoping -- they've been doing it. In fact, so many 
have been making that move lately that the talent pool in the City Assn. has 
evaporated, City and Metro Conference coaches say. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey intended to rate high school referees, two coaches refused 
to list who they thought were the top overall officials. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? The coaches worry that they will abandon high school games for 
college. 
</P>
<P>
One City Harbor Coach who refused said, "Once they get better and know they 
are, they do less and less games and begin doing colleges." 
</P>
<P>
There are two main reasons for the migration. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 is money. 
</P>
<P>
Doing a high school doubleheader (girls followed by boys) pays $73, a lot of 
money, financially strapped high school coaches point out. 
</P>
<P>
But referees argue to the contrary. They counter that a single women's 
community college game pays $49, a community college men's game pays $55. A 
Division III women's game pays $60, a Division III men's game $70, a Division I 
women's game $160 and a Division I men's game at least $225. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason to go college is ego. Everyone knows college assignments are 
reserved for the best officials. Like any other professional, they strive to 
reach the top of their field. 
</P>
<P>
High school coaches are getting frustrated with the trend -- and not just 
because they're getting the younger, inexperienced referees at their games. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Peterson, coach at Kearny High, recently recognized a referee who had been 
skipping high school assignments and taking college jobs. Peterson decided to 
make his job a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to call ourselves the Hoyas," Peterson told the official. "You've 
done so many college games, I thought you'd know who the Hoyas were, not the 
Komets." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson has one major gripe with referees who work games at both levels. 
</P>
<P>
"They bring the college game into the high school gym," he said. "Not much is 
called around the basket, it's a much more physical game and the little guys 
suffer. And if you don't get to the free throw line, you're going to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Thompson of Madison says he has noticed the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you work college games as an official, you let more go," he said. "You 
let them play more." 
</P>
<P>
There is another criticism. One City Central coach, who asked for anonymity, 
said referees who work college games and then come back down to the high school 
level sometimes dog it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys who work a lot of college games I don't like to see doing 
high school because they don't think they have to work as hard," the coach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Referees contacted denied this is the case, saying they try to take the 
attitude that each game is as important as the last, no matter what level it is 
at. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest detriment, one coach said, comes in the playoffs, when many 
referees who stick to the colleges during the season come down to the high 
school level. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the guys who do the playoffs should have more experience with high 
school games," the coach said. "But they do college and then have enough games 
to qualify (for the playoffs). They're good officials, but the calls are 
different than the kids have seen all year." 
</P>
<P>
Again, referees counter this, saying a guideline is issued before the playoffs 
to ensure uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
How many high school level referees do college games? All 35 referees mentioned 
as Best Overall in the survey do. And two, Tom Wood and Casey Basalo, don't 
even take high school assignments any more.

NORTH COUNTY DRAWS FOUL CALL; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTE: SOUTH COUNTY COACHES SAY THEY DON'T LIKE THE TASTE OF THE HOME COOKING 
THEY GET FROM REFEREES IN THE NORTH.

<P>
In a survey designed to rate individual basketball referees, one surprising 
finding was that South County coaches were not pleased with North County 
officiating. 
</P>
<P>
Though coaches were not asked for opinions on the quality of City Assn. and 
North County Assn. officials, many Metro and City Conference coaches voiced 
discontent with the work of referees from the north. 
</P>
<P>
North County coaches, on the other hand, offered no opinions on the difference 
in work. 
</P>
<P>
Many South Bay and city coaches said they felt their teams got "homered" when 
they played a North County school. Others felt the North County Assn. simply 
called a game based on a different philosophy than the City Assn. Still others 
felt that North County referees don't have the talent that city referees 
possess. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Metro coach, "I dread having to have a North County official. They can 
be atrocious. I can see total lack of consistency. You really don't know what 
to expect with North County officials." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling appears to be widely shared: 
</P>
<P>
* "It's really a disaster for city schools to go up there because they don't 
let you play basketball," a City Central coach said. 
</P>
<P>
* "I think it's a ridiculous situation. It's a very poor setup. In my playoff 
experience, it's been detrimental," Chula Vista Coach Mike Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
* "I think the city is far superior to North County. There's just no 
comparison. The middle of the road official here would be in the top 10 in the 
North County," La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth said. 
</P>
<P>
* "If you play in the North County, you're going to get homered to death," said 
another City West coach. 
</P>
<P>
* "Those guys (North County referees) think they're gods. You can't talk to 
them or question them at all," said a City Central coach. 
</P>
<P>
* "North County is a different breed of officials," said Madison's Jim 
Thompson. "It's a whole different ballgame the way they call it. It's an 
equalizer. No matter how much better your team is, (North County officiating) 
is an equalizer. I want to go into a ballgame thinking we are going to win it 
or we are going to lose it, not that the official will take us out of it." 
</P>
<P>
* "If everyone's saying it, then there must be some truth to it, right?" said 
yet another City Central coach. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not necessarily. North County officials didn't tend to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any difference (between the two associations)," said Carl Goff, 
assignment secretary for the North County Assn. "We call tournaments together, 
and I don't notice a difference. I don't really know what they could be talking 
about." 
</P>
<P>
A City Central coach told a different story. He said the North County officials 
aren't necessarily homers, they just call a tighter game than what city teams 
are used to. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us, in the heat of a game, that we are getting homered," Thompson 
said. "But they do call a different game up there. They have different 
philosophies of what a charge is, what over the back is. North County officials 
call a game as if every team is a finesse team." 
</P>
<P>
A city official, Terry McIntire said there could be some truth to that 
observation because many city referees also call college games. When these 
referees do high school games, they are more inclined to allow a physical, 
college-style game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ackerman, the city assignment secretary, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego has a lot of college referees," he said. "And that has a lot to do 
with it. The North County might call a tighter game than the city, and that's 
just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches offered a solution -- have all referees in one association so they 
can attend the same meetings and discuss the same philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Ackerman said there has been some talk of doing just that but that it won't 
happen for at least two years because the current contracts between the San 
Diego Section and each association remain in effect the rest of this season and 
through the next. 
</P>
<P>
"They should all be from one association," Mar Vista Coach George Anderson 
said. "You go to the North County, and it's tough to win because they have 
their own officials. That's not what it's all about. It's the same game, right? 
The dimensions are the same. The height of the basket is the same. Why should 
the refs be any different? But they are."

CRAWFORD HIRES EX-CHARGER FAUCETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Faucette, who played nine games at inside linebacker for the Chargers in 
the 1987 and '88 seasons, has been named football coach of Crawford High, 
replacing Dan Armstrong, who accepted a position at Colton High in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Faucette, 26, played one game for the Chargers during the 1987 strike before 
being sidelined with a knee injury. After eight starts in 1988, his season was 
ended by a neck injury. He was released before training camp last season after 
failing the team physical. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Engle, Crawford's athletic director, said Faucette was selected from six 
candidates.

Angeles Corp.: The Los Angeles-based investment management firm reported a 
second-quarter net loss of $835,000, contrasted with a $777,000 profit a year 
ago. Revenue declined 7% to $9.4 million. The firm said that, as predicted, the 
loss was due primarily to heavy costs during the early stages of development 
and rent-up in Angeles' relatively new businesses of congregate-style housing 
for the independent elderly and factory-direct shopping malls.

"Build it, and they will come." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The voice to Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) in "Field of Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
The voice could just as well be referring to the lake at Carl Thornton Park, 
for since it was built five years ago, the birds -- hundreds of them -- have 
been coming. 
</P>
<P>
They fight, they squawk, they frolic, they beg for French fries. And the people 
who visit the park -- a popular spot for workers looking for a nature break 
during their lunch hour -- are more than willing to share their meals with the 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
The park, at 35 acres, is the second largest in Santa Ana (Centennial Park has 
100 acres), according to Allen Doby, executive director for the Santa Ana 
Recreation and Community Services Agency. The park's namesake was a longtime 
Santa Ana city manager, who served the city from 1952 to the mid-1960s. It 
first opened in 1979, but the three-acre lake -- the park's focal point -- was 
not built until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Doby said he had no idea how many birds call the lake home, but he does know 
the city hasn't contributed to the population. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never put any ducks there," Doby said. "The whole area of Santa Ana is a 
bird refuge, and when they spot water they land." 
</P>
<P>
He said the bird population increases in the winter, and the ducks and other 
birds have begun to breed in the park. However, he added, not all the birds are 
entirely welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to get rid of" the mud hens," Doby said. "They eat up the vegetation 
and really peck away at the grass." 
</P>
<P>
The city may not add to the bird population, but it does stock the lake twice a 
year with fresh-water fish, much to the delight of the children who cast their 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
The park also includes a jogging trail and two softball fields, available for 
rental. The city is installing lights for the field, and night softball should 
be available in six months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the park's lure will continue to be the lake and the birds. And for 
the people who feed the birds, Doby has some advice: "Don't be disappointed if 
they don't eat what you give them right away; they might be overfed." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by the number of people at the park throwing bread crumbs and French 
fries on any given day, he may have a point.

A benefit for the Saddleback Heart Institute of Saddleback Memorial Medical 
Center in Laguna Hills. "An Affair of the Heart" drew 245 guests at $100 each 
to the Ritz-Carlton hotel on Wednesday night, raising an estimated $30,000 in 
ticket sales and other donations. 
</P>
<P>
Doctored Menu 
</P>
<P>
After munching raw vegetables and fresh fruit at cocktail hour, guests headed 
into a pink-and-gray trimmed dining room for what might be the most healthful 
fund-raiser fare of the year. Make that any year. The hotel's executive chef, 
Christian Rassinoux, whipped up a four-course gourmet meal sans salt, butter 
and other evil ingredients now banned from chic cuisine. In their place were 
spices and oils and the leanest of cuisines: cream of curried mushroom soup, 
pear vinaigrette, grilled chicken breast with papaya pesto and peach timbale 
with apple cinnamon sauce. Amazingly, the meal clocked in at a mere 376 
calories. Happily, the chef's recipes were included in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiolingo 
</P>
<P>
Also in the program were the benefit's buzzwords: "heartfelt," "heartwarming" 
and "heart smart." Out in the cocktail hour crowd -- thick with cardiologists 
and other docs -- heart consciousness was high. Event chairwoman Bobbi Hawkins 
said she and her cardiologist husband and their three children "used to be a 
Twinkie-and-Pepsi family." Reformed now, the Hawkinses are a 
skinned-chicken-and-skim-milk brood. "The kids have not seen red meat in 
years," Hawkins said. James Ray, executive vice president of the hospital, said 
he was pleased to hear his teen-age daughters and their friends talking about 
food "the way adults talk about it," he said. "They were saying things like, 'I 
only eat red meat once a week,' and 'I eat a lot of chicken and fish.' I think 
it's great that they're already thinking like that." Unbending to the trend, 
Richard Ferreras, an internist, smiled when asked about his heart smarts. "For 
tonight," he said elliptically. His date, Melinda Francisco, was more direct. 
"He does not eat vegetables," she said, spearing a slice of red pepper with a 
fork. "I do."

Weird Buffet

When did it sound like a good idea to haul a dilatation catheter into the 
cocktail room and plunk it down on a white-clothed buffet table just a few feet 
from the fruits-and-vegetables spread? Whose idea was it to fill another table 
with colorful pictures of vein-encrusted hearts? What's next? Coronary balloons 
lofted over a dance floor? Pacemaker centerpieces?

STATE REOPENS INQUIRY INTO ROBBINS' USE OF MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FUNDS: THE TARZANA STATE SENATOR DENIES FINANCING A DEVELOPMENT NEAR 
MOORPARK WITH A LOAN FROM HIS POLITICAL TREASURY.

<P>
State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp has reopened an investigation into 
allegations that Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) illegally used campaign funds to 
finance a real estate development in Ventura County, it was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from Van de Kamp's office immediately moved to subpoena documents 
from Robbins concerning the property deal, Assistant Atty. Gen. N. Eugene Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The probe focuses on the development of Strathearn Ranch, a 3,850-acre parcel 
near Moorpark in which the lawmaker holds a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he was confident that the renewed investigation would find no 
impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
"There were never any campaign funds that went into the Ranch. Period," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp's office looked into Robbins' role in the Strathearn Ranch 
transaction two years ago as part of a broad investigation into more than 
$400,000 in loans that the lawmaker made from his political campaign treasury. 
Many of the loans went to campaign contributors and business associates of the 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
But in March, 1988, Van de Kamp announced that he had closed the investigation 
because there was no evidence that any of the loans were used for projects that 
would benefit Robbins. This would have been a violation of the state law 
barring the personal use of campaign funds -- a civil violation punishable by a 
fine of twice the amount spent improperly. At the time, Robbins insisted that 
the loans were made to others by his campaign committee as investments -- a 
practice that would be permitted under the state campaign law. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hill said on Friday that the attorney general's office reopened its 
investigation because of sworn statements signed by Robbins as part of a 
lawsuit filed in Los Angeles involving the Strathearn Ranch property. The 
documents, Hill said, indicate that one loan may have helped finance the 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Statements by Robbins "made under penalty of perjury in the private litigation 
contradict information he personally provided to this office," Hill said. "The 
purpose of reopening the investigation is to determine what the facts are." 
</P>
<P>
The court document was part of a countersuit filed by Robbins and Northlake 
Land Co. against one of his partners in the Strathearn Ranch property, Jerry 
Simms. 
</P>
<P>
But Robbins denied that his sworn statement contradicts what he told Van de 
Kamp's investigators two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They were given access to all the records when they did their investigation," 
he said. "If they want to look at them again, they can look at them again." 
</P>
<P>
The new investigation of Robbins adds to the woes facing the veteran lawmaker, 
who is also the subject of an ongoing federal investigation into Capitol 
political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
In that probe, a Senate aide who had become an FBI informant asked for Robbins' 
help in winning approval for special-interest legislation. The bill was 
actually part of an elaborate FBI sting. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins directed the aide, John Shahabian, to then-Sen. Joseph B. Montoya 
(D-Whittier) and suggested that a payment of $3,000 would be needed to win 
Montoya's support for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of the conversation with Robbins was played for the jury that recently 
convicted Montoya of seven counts of extortion, racketeering and money 
laundering. On the tape, Robbins refused Shahabian's offer of a payment, 
saying, "I don't need to be taken care of on every bill that comes through."

THE ENVIRONMENT: TV COMES DOWN TO EARTH; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: NBC'S 'HUNTER' TAKES ON TOXIC WASTE TONIGHT, ALF TAPES AN EARTH DAY 
SPOT, KCBS LAUNCHES A DAILY REPORT AND KTTV DECLARES ITSELF A 'MODEL' STATION.

"I'm already from another planet; I'm not anxious to leave another." 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday afternoon, as news reports rolled in about a 300,000-gallon oil 
spill off the coast in Orange County, Alf, the furry extraterrestrial from 
NBC's comedy series "Alf," was taping this public-service announcement, to be 
shown on the network on Earth Day, April 22. Alf was encouraging viewers to 
protect their environment -- before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 tonight, on NBC's "Hunter," the crime-fighting heroes take on a chemical 
company, investigating the head of the plant for murder after a child dies from 
breathing toxic gas created when cyanide waste is illegally dumped in a 
neighborhood sewer. 
</P>
<P>
These are just two examples of the many environmental messages that TV watchers 
will be seeing in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Like last December's "Prime Time to End Hunger" week, and last year's 
"designated driver" campaign to combat drunk driving, various ecology-minded 
organizations are pushing to make 1990 TV's year of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't speak for the TV industry, but there is definitely a feeling on my 
part, and the part of our writing staff, that people have to become more aware 
of their environment," said Fred Dryer, the executive producer and star of 
"Hunter." 
</P>
<P>
"You hear stories about toxic waste and dumping, and the half-life of these 
chemicals; it makes it difficult to comprehend how unconscionable some of these 
companies are," he continued. "They should be held accountable for it." 
</P>
<P>
While Dryer said that "Hunter" staffers had decided to do an environmental 
story on their own, new activist groups have sprung up to goad other Hollywood 
producers into action, joining with the continuing efforts of such 
organizations as Greenpeace, the National Resources Defense Council and the 
Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, a group of Hollywood heavyweights -- including producer Norman 
Lear, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and Robert Redford -- founded the 
Environmental Media Assn. in Culver City; also new to the scene are the Los 
Angeles-based Earth Communications Office and Ted Danson's American Oceans 
campaign. The groups organize fund-raisers and meet with studio chiefs and 
producers about getting more environmental information into their programs and 
feature films. 
</P>
<P>
Even without specific environmental plot lines, expect TV's characters to 
recycle their bottles, cans and plastic containers, to car-pool, to wear 
T-shirts featuring the logos of environmental organizations, to worry about 
global warming and deforestation and to demand paper bags instead of plastic at 
the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Spahn, president of the Environmental Media Assn., said that his group 
serves as a "clearinghouse for information" for producers, rather than trying 
to exert creative control. The group does, however, offer story suggestions in 
meetings with producers and has been asked to review some scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here as a resource," Spahn said. "Simple behavioral changes like 
recycling or energy conservation, what kind of bag you take at a supermarket, 
all those kinds of things are very easily depicted within the context of a 
show. . . . In this case, there is such a tremendous level of concern about the 
environment, people want to know what they can do. The industry is reflecting 
what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
1990 will host a long list of special ecology programming. On Earth Day, ABC 
will present a two-hour "Earth Day Special" featuring Quincy Jones, Bette 
Midler, Meryl Streep and Kevin Costner, among other stars. Cable's MTV will 
feature animated public-service announcements to appeal to young viewers; HBO 
and Turner Entertainment Network both plan movies with environmental themes. 
"Profit the Earth" will air April 16 as part of a programming campaign that PBS 
has dubbed "Year of the Environment." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, KCBS Channel 2 has launched a daily environmental spot, "Steve Rambo's 
Daily Planet," during its 5 p.m. newscast, and KTTV Channel 11 has declared 
itself "a model environmental station," altering its office operations to 
reflect a new dedication to the environment, as well as adding more 
environment-themed programs to its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
CBS may even introduce a prime-time series about environmental crusaders called 
"The Elite." Richard Chapman, co-executive producer of the two-hour pilot with 
Bill Dial, said that the intent is to focus not only on environmental crimes, 
but also on natural disasters brought about by misuse of environmental 
resources -- such as an avalanche in Switzerland triggered by deforestation, 
which leads to a group of train passengers being trapped beneath the snow in a 
tunnel, or the near-extinction of Indian tribes in the Brazilian rain forest as 
a result of a modern-day gold rush. 
</P>
<P>
"The media is saturated with these large, bewildering issues," Chapman said. 
"We have the charge of boiling it all down into human terms." 
</P>
<P>
David Simon, a producer of NBC's "My Two Dads," said that working with the 
Environmental Media Assn. has only solidified his own concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I have this theory that the '60s are here again," he said. "In the '60s, we 
were kids -- we were concerned, but there was nothing we could really do about 
it. But now we're in positions in government, and in the media, to do something 
about the things we care passionately about." 
</P>
<P>
Simon and other producers acknowledged that environmental themes may sometimes 
conflict with the goals of TV's advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
An upcoming "My Two Dads" episode, for example, deals with trying to kill a 
cockroach without using pesticides. "What if the sponsor were Raid?" Simon 
said. To avoid such potential conflicts, he explained, "You color all of your 
product references, you make indirect statements -- you have to protect where 
the buck is. This is a capitalist society." 
</P>
<P>
On "Hunter," too, said Dryer, "We don't name companies. Every major company has 
toxic waste problems; we're not asking people not to buy products because of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
At "thirtysomething," co-executive producer Marshall Herskovitz has a different 
concern. His ABC series called on the Environmental Media Assn. to help develop 
a story line this season involving a protest against the construction of an 
incinerator. Ironically, the incinerator episodes were also touted as part of 
the "Prime Time to End Hunger" campaign last December because they dealt with 
volunteerism. The show also ran an 800 number for cancer information on recent 
episodes about a character's bout with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, we're in danger of looking like the very thing that I've 
feared -- that we have some sort of pro-social agenda, that the show wants to 
change people's minds about things," Herskovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are basically going about our business, telling the stories we want to 
tell," he maintained. "But in the course of that, we've been able to help out 
certain very benign groups. It's not like we're trying to follow some trend."

PACIFIC SYMPHONY DROPPED OFFER, FOSTER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: CONDUCTOR TELLS OF BREAKDOWN IN NEGOTIATIONS OVER SALARY AND REHEARSAL 
TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The conductor widely regarded as the front-runner for the job of music director 
for the Pacific Symphony said Thursday the orchestra had offered him the job 
but withdrew the offer last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Foster, who conducts orchestras in Monte Carlo and Jerusalem as well 
as operas at the Los Angeles Music Center, said that his negotiations with the 
Pacific began Dec. 23 but broke down over salary and his request for increased 
rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
"They offered me the job in December," Foster said from Los Angeles, where he 
is preparing a revival of Verdi's "Falstaff." 
</P>
<P>
"I had accepted. Negotiations went extremely far. Then the offer was dropped 
last week." 
</P>
<P>
Preston Stedman, head of the Pacific's search committee, would neither confirm 
nor deny Foster's account. "We don't want to comment on any statements that any 
candidates might make," Stedman said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said that he asked for a $150,000 salary for the 1991-92 season, which 
included conducting fees for concerts, an extra fee as music director and a 
travel allowance. Keith Clark, the previous music director, was paid $94,094 in 
1989, his final year. Louis G. Spisto, the executive director who is currently 
the top-paid employee of the orchestra, earned $67,000 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them a total package," Foster said. "I was given to understand that the 
board regarded it as too exorbitant." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 48, said that he had programmed the entire 1990-91 season for the 
organization in the expectation that he would be hired. 
</P>
<P>
"I am brokenhearted," he added. "From the very beginning I became extremely 
excited about the project. . . . But that is their right. It is their 
organization. I can't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra has been auditioning guest conductors to replace Clark, who was 
forced out in February, 1988, after a bitter dispute with the board of 
directors over artistic direction and control of the orchestra he founded in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the salary issue, Foster said, "There was some distrust about my 
commitment to building the orchestra, that I am regarded as a European person 
and would not be sufficiently committed here." 
</P>
<P>
Foster lives in Monte Carlo, where he is in his last season as music director 
of the Orchestra Philharmonique. He said that while he would continue to keep 
his primary residence in Monte Carlo, he was more than willing to commit 
himself to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Foster led the Pacific in September at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Last month, he conducted 
Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro" for the Music Center Opera. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he plans to become music director of the Jerusalem Symphony in 
1991. He is currently music adviser to that orchestra. He did not expect that 
job to take him out of the running for the Pacific Symphony post. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said that conducting the Pacific is not a full-time job and that it is 
not uncommon for a music director to hold that position with more than one 
orchestra.

<P>
But for its modern, mass-media twist, the story is right out of Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
Their mother dead of cancer, three children cling fiercely to each other in the 
temporary care of a family friend. A year goes by, and finally word comes from 
the court: The oldest is to be shipped off to Texas to live with the troubled 
father who left the family years before. The younger two are adopted into a 
settled, middle-class life with a childless couple in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
There in Texas, LeeAnn Robinson chafes under life with a difficult father and 
longs for her brother and sister. She runs away at 16 and vows to find them. 
She eventually succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
But here's the twist. Robinson, who now lives in Westchester and makes her 
living selling Mary Kay Cosmetics, found her family through television. She 
searched them out through an appearance on the NBC program "Unsolved 
Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing there in the studio (after the program ran) and this guy came 
over and said, 'I have your sister on the phone,' " Robinson said in an 
interview. "I just started to cry. I cried for a week." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's reunion with sister Tami Bouchard and brother Jim Chapman was shown 
on Wednesday's regular broadcast of "Unsolved Mysteries." And their story will 
be featured again in "Unsolved Mysteries Third Anniversary Special Edition," 
which preempts "My Two Dads" and "Sister Kate" at 8 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Terry Dunn Meurer and John Cosgrove, "Unsolved Mysteries" boasts of 
solving 35 crimes, finding two missing heirs and reuniting 10 sets of loved 
ones. Hosted by actor Robert Stack, it is among the most popular programs on TV 
this season, finishing 10th last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Unsolved Mysteries" grew out of a series of three specials produced by 
Cosgrove and Meurer for NBC in 1986, called "Missing . . . Have You Seen This 
Person?" They broadened the concept and introduced "Unsolved Mysteries" on Jan. 
20, 1987, first as a succession of specials, then as a weekly series in the 
fall of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Like some newspaper tabloids, "Unsolved Mysteries" has a formula: "Almost every 
show has an unexplained death in it, and almost every show has a lost love 
story," Meurer said. "Then we'll mix and match in there a legend or a gold 
mine, or we'll put in one of our UFO stories." 
</P>
<P>
For viewers, such "reality" shows provide a voyeuristic satisfaction similar to 
that offered by once-popular programs such as "This is Your Life" and "Candid 
Camera." 
</P>
<P>
"Unsolved Mysteries" adds to that stew an element of interactivity -- now the 
viewer is the sleuth, watching the show for photographs or other clues that may 
lead to a discovery that a next-door neighbor is a criminal or a long-lost 
heiress. 
</P>
<P>
"People are fascinated by the idea that they might be living next door to one 
of these people, and might be able to help find them," said producer Meurer. 
</P>
<P>
And while some of the reality programs have been criticized as prurient and 
exploitative, those behind "Unsolved Mysteries" say they're doing a service for 
people. They say Sunday's anniversary show -- with its focus on the repaired 
lives and newly closed cases that have resulted from earlier programs -- is the 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic question, and we've all thought about it, is, 'Is it an intrusion 
into somebody's life?' " Stack said. "But all the people we've helped on the 
show have been very happy to have their mysteries solved." 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, a spot on "Unsolved Mysteries" comes as a result of a plea from 
a person who is looking desperately for someone, and approaches the show as a 
last resort, Muerer said. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian immigrant Carl Dentai, for example, went on the show after more than 
40 futile years in search of the American soldier who had befriended him and 
his family just after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
It was Christmastime, and Dentai and his family were living in a freight car on 
the outskirts of Linz, Austria. A knock on the car's big iron door produced 
Signal Corpsman Phillippe Pelletier, fresh from a British hospital and with an 
invitation to a holiday party the soldiers were throwing for the children of 
the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Pelletier befriended the family, coming often to the cramped train yard to play 
chess. But after Pelletier was transferred back home, the two men lost track of 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
"For 40 years I can't find him and then the show finds him in 40 minutes," said 
Dentai, who brought his family to the United States after the war and settled 
in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for him in newspaper ads since 1956. Then I saw the 'Unsolved 
Mysteries' show and sent a letter to NBC in New York." 
</P>
<P>
But to say that the program relies solely on fate to find its subject matter 
may be a little disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Unsolved Mysteries' advertised in the veterans newspaper, saying the show 
wanted soldiers who were looking for nurses who treated them in Vietnam," said 
vet James Meade, who was reunited with nurse Karen Nelson after an appearance 
on the program. "The ad said the person who wrote the best letter would get on 
the show." 
</P>
<P>
Meurer insisted that the incident was not typical. "That's the only ad we ever 
put in the paper," she said. "That was the researcher's idea." 
</P>
<P>
But if "Unsolved Mysteries" does produce its subjects as much as simply find 
them, perhaps that in itself is an analogy of what the show is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"We're balancing two needs here," said host Stack. "We're trying to produce 
theater and we're trying to do a public service."

FARRAKHAN APPEAL USES KORAN -- AND BIBLE; 
</P>

MINISTRY: THE MUSLIM LEADER TAILORED HIS RECENT SPEECHES FOR NON-NATION OF 
ISLAM FOLLOWERS. BUT HIS RACIAL DOCTRINES PUT OFF SOME IN HIS AUDIENCES.

<P>
When Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan thunders his message of pride, 
independence and equality for black America, he evokes the fiery tones and 
images of a revival preacher. 
</P>
<P>
And the Muslim minister's associates accent his religious role, referring to 
him as "the champion of the cause of redemption," and a man "backed with the 
might of almighty God." 
</P>
<P>
In two recent Los Angeles appearances, Farrakhan studded his talks with 
religious language and references to Allah, Jesus, Moses, Mohammed and Satan. 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral of Oliver Beasley, shot on Jan. 23 by a sheriff's deputy trainee 
during a scuffle in South-Central Los Angeles, Farrakhan eulogized the young 
black Muslim, who was reared as a Christian. Beasley was the "first martyr in 
the new dispensation of the rise of the Nation" of Islam, Farrakhan said. "It 
shall be recalled that not a Muslim died, but a Muslim-Christian. A 
Christian-Muslim. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"His tragedy becomes the beginning of our touching each other as Muslims and 
Christians -- Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals, Jehovah's Witnesses. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
And, continuing his cross-over appeal to Christians in the capacity crowd of 
16,000 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena last weekend, Farrakhan deftly drew from 
passages in the Bible and the Koran, speaking about "God's sacred gift of life" 
given to each individual. "God made Adam from black mud," he said, paraphrasing 
the Genesis account of Creation. "But . . . we are not animals, brothers and 
sisters; we have been raised in dignity." 
</P>
<P>
A theme Farrakhan weaved through much of his 90-minute message was taken from 
the New Testament Book of Revelation, Chapter 6, which describes the Four 
Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
The rider of the "pale horse," he observed, was "death; and hell followed close 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
"Death is riding the neighborhood," he added, interpreting the text to mean 
that wherever "Caucasians have gone . . . you brought death to the (black) 
people . . . and hell." 
</P>
<P>
But, despite Farrakhan's reputation for speaking long and loud on religion, 
most people didn't come out to hear him preach a religious message, judging 
from a sampling of interviews at the Sports Arena. Rather, people came because 
they thought Farrakhan could help stem the violence that has racked the city's 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to stop the killing," said Dr. Clarence Littlejohn, a Los Angeles 
pediatrician, referring to the theme of Farrakhan's speech. "If a little bit of 
religion will help that, that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
"Deep down," added Rosa Toulon, a member of the Baha'i faith who was visiting 
from Hawaii, "I think he's trying to bring people together rather than separate 
them. But he (Farrakhan) leans toward blacks being superior. Baha'is believe in 
being loving to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based Farrakhan leads a branch of Islam that was founded in Detroit 
in the 1930s, and he follows the black supremacy teachings of the late Elijah 
Muhammad. According to the Final Call, the Nation of Islam newspaper, 
Farrakhan's group believes that Allah (God) appeared in the person of Master W. 
Fard Muhammad in 1930, "the long-awaited 'messiah' of the Christians and the 
'mahdi' of the Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan has increasingly garnered support from black Christian clergy. He met 
privately with 70 of them in Los Angeles before his speech in the Sports Arena 
on the night of Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
And he gained a show of support from the orthodox Muslim organization, the 
Islamic Center of Southern California. The center gave $5,000 for Farrakhan's 
ministry at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But some black members of orthodox Islamic mosques in Los Angeles are cool 
toward Farrakhan's version of the world religion. 
</P>
<P>
Abdul Askia, 35, a Los Angeles youth worker, had been a follower of the Nation 
of Islam for 15 years but left recently. Farrakhan's teaching "is radical . . . 
and very selective in its presentation," Askia said, adding that, in his 
opinion, Farrakhan's doctrine of racial superiority inflames young blacks and 
sets the stage for their confrontation with law officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Being told that the black man is a god -- no wonder they are standing up," 
Askia said in an interview. "This is what the people are responding to. . . . 
There is Islam and there is 'Hislam,' . . . Farrakhan is doing his thing . . . 
claiming to be a Muslim and not living (it). Excluding Caucasians is not the 
Islamic way of life." 
</P>
<P>
Saddiq Saafir, the imam, or spiritual leader, of Ibaadillah Mosque on Jefferson 
Boulevard, said there are basic differences between Nation of Islam and 
orthodox Muslim doctrine, particularly in understanding the roles of Fard 
Muhammad and Elijah Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nation is based on some Koran, some Bible and the belief that Elijah 
Muhammad is a messenger of God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"God-consciousness," or taqwa in Islam, is not based on skin color, according 
to Saafir, who is an African-American. "But they (the Nation of Islam) see it 
as being so." 
</P>
<P>
"The differences are there, but we don't argue or discuss them," Saafir 
continued. "We have to live within the context of the Koran and the teachings 
of the Prophet Mohammed. . . . We cannot innovate, change or alter that 
content." 
</P>
<P>
At the Sports Arena, Farrakhan made no apology for his scriptural recitations, 
and the audience appeared familiar with the style of delivery and content of 
black preaching that Farrakhan emulated. 
</P>
<P>
"No man can be hip without a knowledge of the Scripture," he declared. "If we 
could read . . . the Bible and the Koran and understand what it says, we'd 
become wiser than the newscaster, because we'd know the news before it 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
And referring to a conversation in the Koran between Allah and the devil, 
Farrakhan challenged the rival Crips and Bloods gangs -- groups of each sat in 
separate sections in the arena -- to be "one family. . . . They are not natural 
enemies. . . . The enemy (Satan) has intervened between brothers." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a fourth of the audience responded at the end of Farrakhan's message 
when he invited people to raise their hands if "you want to unite with me and 
become part of the Nation of Islam . . . and 1 billion Muslims all over the 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
"Visit the local mosque," he said before launching into a lengthy prayer of 
dismissal in Arabic and English.

'ANGELS' HELP TEND AN URBAN OASIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE K. SCHENDEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The 10th Street Elementary School near downtown Los Angeles is surrounded by a 
neighborhood where drugs spread like weeds. 
</P>
<P>
But at the corner of 11th Street and Union Avenue is a fenced-in strip of land 
where third-graders learn there's more to their turf than drug trafficking and 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
The children in this oasis find a sense of security and someone to watch over 
them, like guardian angels. Actually, gardening angels. 
</P>
<P>
The Gardening Angels is a volunteer group initiated by UC Cooperative 
Extension's Common Ground, which targets areas in the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. The program's goal is to match volunteers who have home 
gardening experience with children who may be more apt to believe that 
vegetables grow on market shelves. 
</P>
<P>
The 10th Street third-graders work in a corner of the community garden near the 
school on land owned by the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
They spend one hour a week during the school year in the garden, marveling that 
the tiny seeds they bury in the ground will, in time and with a little care and 
water, sprout and grow into flowering plants or vegetables -- and maybe even 
provide food for their families' tables. 
</P>
<P>
Common Ground has been planting gardening programs in inner-city schools for 
about 12 years. The Gardening Angels idea took root recently because Common 
Ground hasn't been able to meet the demand from schools wanting gardens, nor 
provide follow-up assistance to those that have them. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume of requests (for help) is overwhelming," says Rachel Mabie, youth 
coordinator for Common Ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We can work with only five to 10 schools a year. With Gardening Angels, we 
hope to reach more. The goal for this year is 20 schools, maybe more, depending 
on how many volunteers we get." 
</P>
<P>
Gardening Angels not only help teachers and students plan gardens, but also 
work one-on-one with students, teaching them soil preparation, weeding, 
watering and harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
"When teachers try to do gardening all on their own," says Mabie, "it's just 
too chaotic with 30 kids. We want to make it more than just an extra recess." 
</P>
<P>
The children aren't the only ones who get something out of these vegetation 
collaborations, Mabie says. 
</P>
<P>
"Volunteers seem to find the experience very rewarding," she says. "Gardeners 
are a rare breed. They're enthusiastic about their hobby, and they share that 
excitement of planting a seed and watching it grow with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
How do you get 30 energetic third-graders excited about agriculture? It doesn't 
take much -- they seem more than happy to learn about gardening in plots that 
look a lot like big sandboxes. 
</P>
<P>
In the community garden on Union Street, 8- and 9-year-olds huddle near the 
edges of the plots to tend radishes, lettuce, carrots and other vegetables, in 
addition to fruit trees and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Gardening really reinforces a lot of things kids learn in the classroom," 
Mabie says. "Gardening Angels is geared toward that -- to use gardening as a 
tool in the curriculum." 
</P>
<P>
Mabie says teachers can use the gardening experience in teaching language and 
math -- such as measuring the planting spaces and making graphs that show plant 
growth, or figuring out how much lettuce it would take to feed their families. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kealy, a 22-year-old volunteer at the 10th Street garden who is joining 
the Peace Corps, says he's getting a lot of useful experience working with the 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a bit overanxious. They want to plant everything as soon as they get 
here," Kealy says, adding that children are well-suited for the challenge. 
"Gardening is kind of a natural thing for kids; they do well out here -- 
especially digging in the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Growing plants is new to some of the children, many of whom live in apartment 
buildings where there is little room for plants and trees, let alone a 
vegetable garden. "Sometimes they don't realize where fruits and vegetables 
come from," Kealy adds. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Rene Flores, egged on by his giggling buddies to talk about his 
gardening experience, said proudly: "Today I planted something round and red." 
</P>
<P>
A radish, his teacher clarified. 
</P>
<P>
Even if students don't always get the plant names right, they almost always get 
a feeling of accomplishment when the seeds they have planted sprout from the 
soil. Sometimes the effects are long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids tell me they went home and started a garden, or at the very least planted 
some seeds in a pot," Mabie says. 
</P>
<P>
Although Common Ground administers the Gardening Angels program, other groups 
that have contributed to its creation include L.A. Beautiful, the Los Angeles 
State and County Arboretum, University of California Master Gardeners and the 
Southern California Horticultural Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is a gardener's paradise," Mabie says. "There are so many gardeners here 
and so many children, I don't think it should be that difficult to match them 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers need to be gardeners first; next, they must enjoy working with 
children. The volunteers will receive two days of training in teaching and 
working with children, including those with disabilities, beginning Tuesday and 
Feb. 20 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years we've worked with a lot of handicapped children and they 
respond very well," Mabie says. "They often feel a real lack of self-esteem and 
a sense of inadequacy. When they plant a seed, watch it grow and harvest its 
fruit, it gives them a real feeling of satisfaction, like, 'I can succeed just 
like anybody else.' " 
</P>

ORCHIDS, OTHER EXOTIC FLOWERS ON SALE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Guffey is a Malibu-based free-lance garden writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 170 species of orchids and other exotics will be featured at the Los 
Angeles State and County Arboretum's Valentine plant sale in Arcadia today. 
</P>
<P>
The arboretum holds many plant sales throughout the year, but this is the only 
one to focus on orchids, many of which are just beginning their prime flowering 
season. The sale plants come from three sources: surplus arboretum stock, 
seedlings grown in the arboretum's glasshouses especially for this sale and 
commercial suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most plentiful will be cymbidiums, the best of all orchids for 
outside cultivation in Southern California. Moth orchids (Phalaenopsis) and 
lady slipper (Paphiopedilum) species will also be well represented at the sale, 
along with corsage orchids (Cattleyas). The frilly cattleyas, ranging from 
delicate white to golden orange and regal purple, are usually snapped up early 
in the sale by orchidists adding to their glasshouse collections. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many of the more unusual species will disappear soon after the gates 
open at 9 a.m. Get there early for the best selection. Most orchids are priced 
in the $5-to-$35 range, although a few exceptionally fine specimens may be 
priced as high as $150. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Ross, curator of orchids, reports that the arboretum is growing more and 
more exotic plants from seed to reduce wild-plant collecting, a serious 
horticultural problem today. He expects to have a large number of Stanhopea 
orchid species ready for the sale. Planted in hanging baskets, they bear waxy, 
fragrant blooms on scapes extending from the bottom of the basket. Stanhopeas 
can be grown outside in a protected area. 
</P>
<P>
 For cultivation indoors, Ross recommends moth orchids, currently among the 
trendiest of flowering house plants. In garden windows on the north side of the 
house, moth orchids thrive and bloom for four to six weeks, usually beginning 
in February. When the first bloom ends, Ross suggests breaking off the flower 
spike at the second node. This encourages a second set of blooms to appear 
about 90 days later. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the biggest complaint with orchids, Ross says, is lack of bloom. Why 
do they stop blooming? Almost always, the reason is insufficient light. Most 
orchids require a full day of filtered light. The glasshouse at the arboretum 
is covered with shade cloth during the hours when the sun is strongest. But at 
2 in the afternoon, the shade cloth rolls back and is not returned until 9 the 
next morning. 
</P>
<P>
This means the orchids receive full sun in the late afternoon and early 
morning. Of course, the light is refracted from the high glass overhead, but 
the orchids still are basking in a healthy dose of sunshine each day. 
</P>
<P>
Moth and lady slipper orchids require somewhat less light than do the cattleyas 
and cymbidiums. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to orchids, visitors to the Valentine plant sale will find exotic 
heliconias. These tropical blooms look like colorful lobster claws, and 
florists are beginning to rely upon them heavily for long-lasting, stunning 
arrangements. Other tropical plants available at the sale are aromatic gingers, 
pearl anthuriums, frangipani, jasmine "Pikake," and variegated hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
Although orchids and tropical plants are the primary focus of the Valentine 
sale, the arboretum also will sell an assortment of organic herbs (grown 
without chemical sprays). These include onion and garlic chives, golden thyme, 
lemon thyme, spearmint, applemint, peppermint, pineapple mint and pineapple 
sage. More herbs for the kitchen are marjoram, Green oregano, Italian oregano, 
Mexican oregano, rosemary, tricolor sage, sorrel and tarragon. These herbs are 
potted in 1- and 5-gallon containers, thus producing instant herb gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the Valentine plant sale will also find beautiful blooms and 
flowering trees on the arboretum grounds. Spring pansies, primroses and poppies 
are ablaze with color, and many of the magnolias, camellias and azaleas are 
beginning to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
But the most spectacular show at the entire arboretum at this time of the year 
is inside the tropical display greenhouse. Here the best of the blooming 
orchids and other flowering plants from all arboretum glasshouses are displayed 
against a backdrop of huge ferns, running brooks and tropical trees dripping 
with live moss. To see orchids at their best, don't miss the tropical 
greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Experts will be on hand to answer questions about how to grow exotic plants. 
The Valentine sale runs from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Ayres Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles State and County Arboretum is at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia. 
Admission to the sale is included in the arboretum entrance fee of $3 for 
adults; admission is $1.50 for senior citizens, students with ID and youths 13 
to 17. The fee for children 5 to 12 is 75 cents. Children under 5 are admitted 
free.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 254 to 166, the House agreed to debate a bill expanding voter 
registration under a restrictive rule that limits amendments from the floor. 
The bill (HR 2190) addresses the problem of plummeting citizen turnout on 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify more potential voters, it enables eligible Americans to register 
automatically when they obtain a driver's license, provides for registration 
desks at many government and private facilities and permits mail registration. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and GOP sponsors thought they had secured bipartisan support of a 
debating rule limiting Republicans to a single amendment embodying all changes 
they would make in the legislation. Such limited rules are used when sponsors 
fear that an onslaught of amendments will kill their measure. 
</P>
<P>
But the unity dissolved when President Bush raised last-minute objections to 
the bill, prompting GOP leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) to oppose the rule. 
Angry Democrats then questioned whether House Republicans, the minority party, 
are sincere in calling for more bipartisanship in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Al Swift (D-Wash.) complained that Michel had acted to "unilaterally 
and single-handedly trash that agreement" on a debating rule. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-N.Y.) said: "This rule itself is an 
anti-voters' rights rule" as it relates to House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to debate the voter registration bill under a 
restrictive rule.

LOCKOUT EMITS WINTRY CHILL; 
</P>
<P>
SPRING TRAINING: IT COULD MEAN ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR SOME SUN BELT TOWNS, 
BUSINESSES DEPENDENT ON CAMPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While white-shirted executives sit in stale meeting rooms and argue over 
methods to make ballplayers millionaires, the thoughts of a grocer in Dunedin, 
Fla., and a hotel operator in Mesa, Ariz., are elsewhere. They are more 
concerned with the economic impact of a spring training lockout that could keep 
them from realizing their economic dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Barring a late settlement, baseball's spring training camps will not open next 
week. And that translates to a loss of income for many businesses that bank on 
the six-week spring training period. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to recent published reports, however, Florida officials are not 
estimating a $300-million loss to the state's economy if there is a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
That figure represents the financial influx spring training added to the 
state's economy in 1987, according to a study. Officials agree there will be a 
financial impact, but are uncertain how bad it will be. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 major league teams, 18 train in Florida. Still, Floridians boast 
their state has more to offer tourists than spring baseball. They hope that 
revenue normally generated by spring training will be diverted into other 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 37 million visitors a year in Florida, and a good third of them come 
through in February and March," said Ron Safford, director of sports promotion 
for the state. 
</P>
<P>
"For the sports enthusiast, even though spring training may not occur, there is 
plenty down here to do and see, and it may actually open some eyes to the value 
of some of these other sports. We are trying to look on the bright side of 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Studies indicate that although 63% of Florida's tourists are influenced to 
visit the state because of spring training, only 7% of those who stay in hotels 
attend it. 
</P>
<P>
Snowbirds, as those who head to warmer climates in the winter months are called 
by Arizona and Florida residents, make reservations months in advance for 
extended stays during Florida's peak season of February and March. 
</P>
<P>
A good example of that is in Vero Beach, where the Dodgers train. The Chamber 
of Commerce says hotels report solid bookings through March, and reservations 
are not contingent on spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vero Beach, $20-25 million is generated each spring training," said J. B. 
Norton, executive vice president of the Vero Beach chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss to us if the Dodgers aren't here is about $5 million. The tourists 
are going to be here anyway. The major loss is going to be in the rentals of 
homes and condos by the Dodger players, at the restaurants and car rental 
agencies. Also, there are many people who live in the state who love the 
Dodgers and drive over for the day." 
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Grill in Vero Beach expects to lose 30 to 50 dinners a night without 
spring training. The restaurant says the loss of business will be primarily 
Dodger personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say, and I have nothing to back this up, but about 15% of our winter 
visitors come to Vero Beach specifically for spring training," Norton said. "We 
are a resort state, so people are going to be here anyway. The hotels were full 
in Port St. Lucie before the New York Mets moved there two years ago. And 
beginning the latter part of this month, it will be difficult to find a room." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger players who normally bring their families to Vero Beach might have a 
problem finding housing, should the lockout suddenly end. Dodgertown, the 
team's spring training facility, houses players only. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism, however, can't override reality for many Florida businesses. The 
Days Inn in Vero Beach estimates a loss of $12,000 without spring training. 
</P>
<P>
And in Dunedin, Fla., where the Toronto Blue Jays train, a new $2.5-million 
stadium will be ready March 2. But without the Blue Jays, the annual payment of 
$300,000 on the park will be tough for the city to make. Dunedin's population 
is 35,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not desperate, but it's not good," said Cecil Englebert, who was 
instrumental in bringing the Blue Jays to Dunedin. "The tourists are still 
going to be here, but they are going to spend money somewhere else in the state 
and not locally. At Disney World or someplace. But not from the local grocer." 
</P>
<P>
There is less reason for optimism in Arizona. The state's economy is suffering 
from a severe real estate slowdown and banking collapse. Property values have 
plunged, and foreclosures are widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona counts on spring training to generate nearly $160 million. Although 
studies show a relatively small group of tourists visit Florida specifically 
for spring training, baseball is the primary draw for tourists at most southern 
Arizona sites at this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven Arizona cities that play host to major league teams, only three 
are bona fide vacation resorts -- Scottsdale, Phoenix and Tucson. Rarely do 
people plan to vacation in Mesa, Yuma, Tempe or Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
But camp operators in at least two cities, Mesa and Tempe, have reportedly 
taken out lockout insurance policies with Lloyd's of London. And it is believed 
that Chandler and Scottsdale have also taken out policies, but camp operators 
would not confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the HoHoKam organization, which runs the Chicago Cubs' camp in 
Mesa, has bought a policy that would cover payments on a recent $400,000 
improvement of the stadium. They said that the policy also will cover basic 
operating expenses and be paid on a pro-rated basis during any lockout. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no insurance for the Mesa economy. Besides the Cubs, the Angels 
and Milwaukee Brewers stay in Mesa hotels. The Brewers play their games in 
nearby Chandler, and the Angels begin spring training in Mesa and then move 
their camp to Palm Springs in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
Studies indicate that the Cubs alone add $37.5 million to the Mesa economy, and 
the Angels generate another $15.5. Combined, the teams spend nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We count on March to get us through the rest of the year, so I would say it 
would be quite disastrous if there is no spring training," said Deidra Draper, 
general manager of the Mazona Motor Hotel, where the Cubs stay. 
</P>
<P>
"Tours from Chicago have already expressed concern in sending their deposits, 
and the first tour is not scheduled to arrive until March 3, so if they cancel 
72 hours in advance we will issue refunds. I would say we would lose about 
$150,000 if there is no spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Also hard hit will be Mesa's Boys and Girls Club, whose concession business at 
three parks accounted for $500,000, or half of its annual operating income last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
And many of Arizona's charities, which derive income from ballpark concessions 
and parking, would suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I have a vacation now," said Rick (the Peanut Man) Kaminski, who has 
worked as a vendor for the Boys and Girls Club for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We get 25 cents for each item we sell, so individually I will lose about 
$2,500 to $3,000 for the one-month period when the games are played." 
</P>
<P>
Cub announcers Steve Stone and Harry Caray are co-owners of restaurants in 
Mesa, about five minutes from the Cubs' ballpark, and in Scottsdale. Stone 
anticipates a major plunge in business in Mesa and a loss of about 25% in 
Scottsdale. 
</P>
<P>
"The hotels in Scottsdale are booked because people have to make their 
reservations in advance, regardless," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
"But if there is no spring training, will the people still come? They might. 
Will they go to the same haunts they would have gone to if the baseball players 
were here? I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Palm Springs, where the Angels spend the last two weeks of spring 
training, estimate the team generates about $3 million for the city. But Palm 
Springs officials look at spring training as merely one of many tourist 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Florida, Arizona and Palm Springs also stand to lose in a way that can't be 
measured in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Said Florida's Safford: "We know for a fact that folks in Boston, when they are 
snowbound in their apartment or they come home and have that warm cup of cocoa 
and sit down in front of the evening news, and they see film footage from 
Florida of their team -- people in short sleeves in Florida participating 
outdoors in warm weather -- they know that spring is coming. And in a month, 
their team is coming up with a new season, a clean record, a chance to win the 
pennant, they say, 'This is the year for us!' 
</P>
<P>
"That warm sense they get is the best public relations you can ever have for a 
state, and that will be somewhat lost if we don't have spring training. That's 
our major loss." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball lore has it that long ago, Dodger management, in an effort to 
determine the impact the team's presence had on Vero Beach, decided to conduct 
a study. 
</P>
<P>
They paid their ballplayers in $2 bills, then waited to see where the bills 
turned up. Soon, the story goes, every merchant in town had registers 
overflowing with $2 bills. 
</P>
<P>
That's not likely to happen this year.

<P>
Baseball's owners reaffirmed Friday that a lockout of spring training camps 
will begin Feb. 15, unless the Major League Players Assn. agrees to the concept 
of revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a news conference after the owners meeting, there seemed to be a 
dedicated attempt to avoid using the word lockout, a softening of both position 
and rhetoric, and the hint that key elements in the revenue-sharing proposal 
will be withdrawn or changed when collective-bargaining negotiations resume 
Monday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The owners' meeting had been portrayed by Charles O'Connor, general counsel of 
the owners' Player Relations Committee, as a deadline for deciding if there was 
enough time to open the camps by Feb. 15. But indicative of the conciliatory 
tone Friday was optimism expressed by O'Connor and others that a settlement by 
Monday or Tuesday would permit an opening as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and chairman of the PRC, said in the 
news conference that he felt clubs would be in position to open spring training 
within four or five days of an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Barring major changes in the revenue-sharing proposal, a Monday or Tuesday 
resolution seems doubtful. The union has said that the proposal is designed 
strictly to lower salaries and eliminate the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Friday if there will be changes in the proposal Monday, O'Connor said his 
staff will talk over the weekend and try to take new ideas to the table. He 
alluded to discussions in the owners' meeting and said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to come to a meeting of this type and not have been educated. 
You're bound to take some of that education back to the talks. Whether that's 
reflected (in a change) on page one of the proposal or page two, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday, we'll discuss where we are. If the opportunity presents itself, there 
could be a change in rhetoric, a change in discussion, a change in the 
proposal. I don't know if it will happen Monday, but it will happen at some 
point." 
</P>
<P>
It was speculated Friday that the pay-for-performance aspect, criticized by 
both owners and players, is almost certain to be withdrawn. That provision 
calls for salaries of players with zero to six years of major league service to 
be determined by a two-year statistical table that fails to account for 
defense, character and intangible contributions. It would also eliminate 
arbitration and both guaranteed and multiyear contracts for players in that 
category. 
</P>
<P>
The PRC has consistently said that pay for performance was only a suggested 
means of allocation. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor reiterated Friday that the key component for the clubs is knowing how 
much revenue to budget for salaries. Cost certainty, he calls it. The proposal 
calls for 48% of the clubs' gate and national TV income to go toward salaries. 
Even if that was raised to the 53% of total revenue that players in the NBA 
receive, there is some question if the union will accept revenue sharing, with 
its inherent restrictions on free agency and arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, has cited current prosperity and said 
the PRC has been unable or unwilling to demonstrate a current or future need 
for revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never premised this proposition on making every club profitable," 
O'Connor said Friday. "The industry is obviously healthy. Profitability is not 
our goal, nor are we debating large and small markets. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the history of the last 10 years, what we're trying to 
resolve is the question of what percentage of revenues are the players entitled 
to. We're not tied to any one part or detail of it, but we think that revenue 
sharing is the best way to put stability in the relationship." 
</P>
<P>
None of the spokesmen were willing to say how long the owners would pursue 
revenue sharing if the union continued to resist. Asked about the scheduled 
opening of the season on April 2, Commissioner Fay Vincent said a group of 
general managers was studying the question of how much spring training would be 
necessary to maintain that date. 
</P>
<P>
"My own guess is roughly three weeks," Vincent said, meaning he could go to 
mid-March before jeopardizing the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the public reaction to a spring lockout, Vincent said, "the 
public is as eager to have baseball as we are and the players are. This will 
not be something to celebrate. There are significant negative consequences. But 
I also don't think the public cares about strategy. I think the public wants 
baseball in accord with the baseball schedule." 
</P>
<P>
It is believed, in that regard, that Vincent ultimately will order the camps 
opened to preserve the start of the season. He reiterated, however, that he is 
not inclined to issue such an order while the parties are still at the table. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to find ways to be relevant and helpful, but I believe in the 
process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent brought union and management representatives together three times last 
week, and his behind-the-scenes involvement, sources said, contributed to the 
conciliatory tone Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although there had been media speculation that several clubs oppose a lockout, 
Selig insisted that Friday's meeting, which lasted only two hours, was 
"non-confrontational in every sense." 
</P>
<P>
Reading from a statement at the news conference, Selig said changes in strategy 
and bargaining position were not requested or made during the meeting, and that 
the ownership remained entirely supportive of the negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
Selig said there was no need for a vote since ownership had passed resolutions 
in July and December in support of PRC strategy, including a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Feb. 15 deadline put pressure on both sides, but "we're not in a 
position yet where we have to sit and wonder how many days of spring training 
are we going to have. The camps will not open on Feb. 15 if we don't have an 
agreement, but there's time to reach that agreement. We're going back to the 
table Monday and we'll be there every day." 
</P>
<P>
Technically, players are not required to be in spring training until Feb. 28. 
Players who report earlier do so on a voluntary basis. O'Connor said that given 
the time structure, he was hesitant to call it a lockout until late March or a 
date when the regular season was actually affected. 
</P>
<P>
He said that major league managers and coaches would not be permitted to join 
minor league workouts, but that injured players receiving treatment could 
continue to receive it at their home or spring training stadium. He said no 
decision had been reached as to the possibility of playing the exhibition 
schedule with minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
Most owners left for the airport while the news conference was in progress or 
later refused comment, saying members of the PRC would talk for them. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds: 
</P>
<P>
"There's still time for the camps to open, but if there's no agreement, we'll 
support the PRC. I'm sure they'll work out something that's best for baseball. 
We all care what the fans think, myself in particular." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr, meeting with players in Phoenix, said a Feb. 15 shutdown represented a 
lockout no matter what O'Connor or anyone else called it, and he reiterated 
that the absence of genuine bargaining by management is likely to result in a 
legal action by the union. 
</P>
<P>
Of the fans, he said, "I think it's going to be hard for an industry that just 
signed a $1.5-billion television contract to generate any sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOCKOUT ISSUES 
</P>
<P>
WHAT OWNERS WANT 
</P>
<P>
-Revenue sharing. Players would be guaranteed 48% of the money from ticket 
sales and broadcast contracts. 
</P>
<P>
-Pay-for-performance. Players with fewer than six years of major league service 
would be paid on one-year, nonguaranteed contracts according to statistical 
formulas. Each team would pay 1/26th of the total for these players. 
</P>
<P>
-Participation level. Teams going above predetermined payroll levels could not 
sign free agents from other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
WHAT PLAYERS WANT 
</P>
<P>
-Salary arbitration. Eligibility restored to players with between two and three 
years of service. 
</P>
<P>
-Rosters. Restored to 25 players. 
</P>
<P>
-Minimum salary. A raise from $68,000 to between $100,000 and $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
-Free agency. Players removed from 40-man roster and sent to minors on outright 
assignments would become free agents. Draft pick compensation for free agents 
would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
-Collusion. Automatic penalties for collusion. 
</P>
<P>
-Benefits. An increase tied to the new television contracts. 
</P>

DOUGLAS EXPECTED TO BE AN EASY PAYDAY FOR TYSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James (Buster) Douglas, who was two rounds away from a piece of the heavyweight 
championship three years ago, gets another chance Sunday (tonight), this time 
against Mike Tyson in the Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 29, a former junior college basketball player from Columbus, Ohio, is 
a huge underdog against Tyson, who most figure will make Douglas his 34th 
knockout victim. Tyson has won all 37 of his fights and Douglas has a 29-4-1 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson weighed in at 220 pounds. Douglas was 231 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was ahead on points against Tony Tucker, the International Boxing 
Federation's champion, at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1987 but faltered in the 10th 
round and was knocked out. He has won six in a row since, all by knockout. But 
at no time has he looked like a serious threat to Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
For Tyson, Douglas is the last obstacle to probably his biggest payday yet -- 
the Evander Holyfield showdown, June 18, in Atlantic City. Japanese promoter 
Akihiko Honda is paying Tyson about $6 million for his second Tokyo appearance. 
But Tyson could make anywhere from $22 million to $25 million against Holyfield 
in what is projected as possibly boxing's richest fight -- providing Tyson 
defeats Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Tyson will reduce the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance by more than $6 
million. While here he signed promotional contracts with Toyota and Minolta. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Tyson's first appearance since his 93-second knockout of Carl 
Williams last July 21 and his second Tokyo fight. In March of 1988, he knocked 
out Tony Tubbs in two rounds in the first sports event in Tokyo's domed 
stadium, known here as the Big Egg. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson is defending his title for the 10th time. Two of his last three victories 
haven't gone past Round 1. It is Japan's third heavyweight title fight. The 
first two, including George Foreman's one-rounder over Joe Roman in 1973, 
lasted a total of 7 minutes 34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
This fight is for two of Tyson's three championships. The IBF isn't recognized 
by the Japan Boxing Federation, so if Douglas should happen to pull a 
monumental upset, he would be the WBC and WBA champion, and Tyson would remain 
the IBF champion. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who will make about $2 million, according to Tyson's promoter, Don 
King, last fought on the undercard of Tyson-Williams, when he seemed listless 
and tentative in plodding to a 10th-round knockout over little-known Oliver 
McCall. 
</P>
<P>
Some thought Douglas had blown his title shot with that showing, but other 
events played out in his favor. Michael Dokes overpriced himself with King, 
demanding $3 million to fight Tyson. King signed Tyson instead to fight Razor 
Ruddock in Edmonton, Canada, last November, but that fight was postponed 
indefinitely when Tyson became ill. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Douglas was available for the Tokyo date King had promised 
Honda. After appearing on five Tyson undercards, Douglas steps up today to the 
main event. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Douglas says, he brings better physical and spiritual armament. 
</P>
<P>
"I just ran out of gas against Tucker," he said. "When it came time to suck it 
up in that fight, it just wasn't there. This time, I've trained as an athlete, 
not just as a boxer. I needed better conditioning and I got it. I'm in the best 
shape of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has had to overcome the death of his mother last month, which delayed 
by several days his departure to Japan. And several months ago, Douglas' wife 
left him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had personal problems, but I've used them to motivate me for this fight," 
he said. "I took the Lord Jesus into my life last July 22. Satan knows that, 
and he knows I'm a great guy, so he's always out there, coming hard after me." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, the son of 1950s middleweight and light-heavyweight Bill Douglas, is 
trained by an uncle, J. D. McCauley, and is managed by John Johnson, who was an 
assistant football coach under Woody Hayes at Ohio State in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson calls himself "a disciple of Jesus Christ and Woody Hayes." 
</P>
<P>
He insists that Douglas is prepared for the assignment at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Buster has taken some heat for his performance against McCall last summer," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"But (Don) King had told us we'd get a title shot before that fight, so we 
fought McCall conservatively. All we wanted Buster to do was win, and not get 
caught with anything." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was asked to comment after an angry Tyson had uttered an expletive 
before about 500 Japanese reporters at a news conference. He started to knock 
Tyson, then pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he's been a good heavyweight champion . . . for all the power he 
has to influence young people . . . well, let's just say I'd do things a little 
differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His game plan, he said, will be a mix of power and movement. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing is to hit with a lot of power, that's the main thing," he 
said. "And I'll show him some movement outside, but I want to go in on him, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
If Douglas goes in on Mike Tyson, the best guess is that the trend of short 
heavyweight title fights in Japan will continue. In other words, seldom will so 
many have paid so much to see so little. Honda is charging $1,035 for a 
ringside seat today, $635 more than he got for Tyson-Tubbs.

MILE, 1,500 MARKS FALL TO MELINTE

Romanian Doina Melinte smashed world indoor records in the women's 1,500 meters 
and the mile, but Britain's Peter Elliott fell just short in his attempt to 
break those marks in men's events Friday night in the Meadowlands Invitational 
track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
Melinte, 33, the 1984 Olympic gold medalist at 800 meters and the silver 
medalist in the 1,500, ran the second half of the mile almost by herself after 
Brit Lind-Peterson of Canada dropped out after setting the pace for about 800 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
Melinte, intent on earning the $100,000 that was being awarded to any runner 
breaking the world record in the mile, finished in 4 minutes 17.13 seconds. She 
was clocked in 4:00.27 for 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Melinte had held the mile record of 4:18.86, set in 1988 on the fast, 
10-laps-to-the-mile Meadowlands track. The previous record for the 1,500 was 
4:00.8, set by Mary Decker Slaney of the United States in 1980 at Madison 
Square Garden in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect to keep the money," Melinte said. "The best thing about (the 
Romanian) revolution is that now I can keep all the money." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, coming off a brilliant victory in the 1,500 meters at the Commonwealth 
Games in Auckland, New Zealand, last week, thought he had a shot at Eamonn 
Coghlan's indoor record of 3:49.78 and the $100,000 bonus that was on the line. 
But he couldn't maintain a fast early pace and finished in 3:52.02, breaking 
the British indoor record of 3:53.70 he set in finishing second to Ireland's 
Marcus O'Sullivan in the 1988 Meadowlands mile. 
</P>
<P>
Also, two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom won for the first time in the 
indoor track and field season, and double Olympic gold medalist Jackie 
Joyner-Kersee suffered her third consecutive loss, falling to LaVonna Martin in 
the women's 55 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-meter world record-holder Butch Reynolds was declared the winner of the 
600-yard race after first-place finisher Danny Harris was disqualified for 
knocking down Antonio McKay.

NEWSWIRE: ABC WILL HONOR CFA AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC Sports announced Friday that it will honor its agreement with the College 
Football Assn., beginning in 1991, minus Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
ABC declined to discuss what it will pay, but a source said the price for the 
five-year package was trimmed from $210 million to $175 million, or $7 million 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The price was reduced because Notre Dame pulled out of the CFA television 
package to make a deal of its own with NBC for its home games. 
</P>
<P>
ABC said: "The CFA has confirmed the participation of its entire membership in 
the ABC package, with the exception of Notre Dame, whose away games ABC has the 
option to carry. ABC will have the right to select home games of 63 member 
institutions." 
</P>
<P>
ESPN also reached an agreement with the CFA by picking up an extra year for 
only $15 million. ESPN had been close to a one-year extension for $30 million 
before Notre Dame bolted. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN originally had a four-year, $110-million agreement with the CFA. Now the 
cable network has five years for $125 million. LARRY STEWART

BOWMAN SUFFERS BACK SPASMS, TAKES A FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christopher Bowman, who calls himself Hans Brinker from hell, spent a night 
there Friday. He suffered back spasms before going onto the ice and then skated 
one of the poorest performances of his career to virtually eliminate himself 
from contention in the national figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, the defending champion and runner-up in the 1989 World Championships, 
fell once, failed to complete his required combination jumps and then almost 
fell again. 
</P>
<P>
Only the generosity of the judges, who scored him high for his presentation, 
enabled him to finish as high as fourth in the original program, which is where 
he remained in the overall standings entering Sunday's freestyle competition. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. David Howe, medical director for the championships, treated Bowman for the 
recurring back spasms both before and after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a treatable problem," Howe said, indicating that Bowman could compete 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for his title hopes is less optimistic. For Bowman, from Van 
Nuys, to win, catastrophe would have to strike the three skaters who are ahead 
of him. Considering their performances Friday night at the Salt Palace, that is 
highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Eldredge, an 18-year-old former world junior champion who is from South 
Chatham, Mass., but has trained in San Diego for the last two years, added a 
victory in the original program to one Thursday in the compulsory figures to 
take a commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
But a Salt Palace crowd of 8,479 gave its first standing ovation of the week to 
Paul Wylie, a 1988 Olympian and Harvard undergraduate, who finished second in 
the original program and improved from third to second in the overall 
standings. Mark Mitchell of Hamden, Conn., is third. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, 25, also received the first perfect 6.0 scores of the week, both for his 
stylish presentation. It was a significant improvement over last year, when he 
entered the championships as a co-favorite along with Bowman but finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned last year that nobody owes you a living in the sport," Wylie said. 
"You must go out there and make it happen every day. I trained ad nauseum, and 
it worked." 
</P>
<P>
This year, it was Bowman's turn to take the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It went through my head: 'The door is open; if you don't walk through it, 
you're dumber than anybody,' " Wylie said of his reaction when Bowman had his 
problems. "It didn't take any pressure off. I said, 'You've got to put yourself 
on the line and do it.' The short program is like the final putt. Everything is 
on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough sport. You hate to see somebody like Chris go down. He's a great 
skater. But, at the same time, that's part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has had three consecutive four-time men's champions, Charlie 
Tickner, Scott Hamilton and Brian Boitano. Bowman is not likely to add his name 
to that list. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes it strange," Wylie said. "Past nationals have always been more of a 
coronation." 
</P>
<P>
The king is injured; long live the king. Or perhaps it is more appropriate to 
call Bowman the chief. A flamboyant skater, he dressed Friday night in an 
American Indian costume, including a headband that, as one U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. official said, "makes him look like Tonto." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, 22, has received as much attention for his off-the-ice adventures as 
for his performances, but he has proved himself as one of the world's best 
skaters. If he does not finish among the top three here, however, the USFSA 
will have to decide whether to still send him to the World Championships next 
month in Halifax, Canada.

DANIELS EYES THE MARKETPLACE, AGREES TO CONTRACT FOR $600,000 
</P>

<P>
Kal Daniels, stung by lower salaries recently given to comparable players, 
settled his differences with the Dodgers and avoided arbitration Friday by 
agreeing to a one-year deal worth $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
In compromising between his request for $700,000 and the Dodgers' offer of 
$550,000, the outfielder was influenced by the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Cleveland outfielder Chris James, who has comparable experience 
and statistics, signed for $560,000. Earlier this week, Angel outfielder Devon 
White lost an arbitration decision and was awarded $580,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The White case was the real killer for us," said Lou Oppenheim, Daniels' 
agent. "White even has better numbers than Kal, and when a guy with better 
numbers signs for less money than you are asking, you are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"So actually, Kal is pleased. We feel good getting what we got." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who was traded to the Dodgers by Cincinnati July 18, played in 11 
games here because of a knee injury that required arthroscopic surgery. In 38 
at-bats, he hit .342 with two home runs and eight runs batted in. Daniels says 
he is running and is ready for spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, now will try to sign players with fewer 
than three years' experience. At the top of that list is pitcher Tim Belcher, 
who played for $225,000 last season but will be seeking nearly $1 million. BILL

BOXING: CHAMPION SEES LITTLE OF TOKYO BEFORE FACING DOUGLAS.

<P>
George Armstrong Custer stiffened, dropped his pistol and fell limply to the 
ground, a Sioux arrow in his back. 
</P>
<P>
The heavyweight boxing champion of the world smiled thinly as he watched the 
movie "Little Big Man." Sitting on the floor, he looked up at reporters who had 
come by. No questions were asked until the champion could see how the battle of 
the Little Big Horn came out. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," Mike Tyson said. "Wipeout. Well, Custer . . . Now, that guy had some 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson in Tokyo. This guy has problems, too. But lucky for him, he has to dodge 
only the spotlight, not arrows. 
</P>
<P>
He seems more intent on avoiding Japanese reporters than he does in beating 
James (Buster) Douglas, his opponent in the Tokyo Dome Sunday (tonight, PST). 
</P>
<P>
He's not cruising the Ginza. There is no basking in a spotlight that seems much 
more sharply focused on his squarish form here than anywhere else. He's not in 
the spotlight here, he's impaled on it. So, we find him where he is almost 
every mid-morning, in his hotel suite, sitting on the floor, a pile of video 
movies at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
He does his road work at 3 a.m. to avoid armies of Japanese camera crews on 
bicycles who shiver in the 30-degree cold, watching all exits of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them I run at 4 a.m.," Tyson said, grinning. "So I run at 3 a.m. I 
miss most of them, but not all of them." 
</P>
<P>
He and his sparring partners go to the Korakuen Gym to train, cars with dark 
windows pulling up at a rear entrance, so he can enter unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese newscasts have shown Tyson feeding polar bears at the Tokyo Zoo, Tyson 
congratulating participants in a wheelchair basketball game, Tyson at a martial 
arts studio . . . 
</P>
<P>
A week ago he said: "Ali loved this -- I hate it." 
</P>
<P>
To visitors in his suite now, he struggles to explain the balancing act he 
performs, with fame and the need for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gone out much," he said. "I like it quiet and peaceful. (Fame) can 
take a lot out of you. But it's nothing I can't handle. Some guys, they get 
famous and kill themselves, you know what I mean? I can handle it, but I don't 
have to like it. 
</P>
<P>
"But you know what? It can stop quick, man. If you're a great singer, all you 
got to do is sing a bad song. If you're a great actor, don't make a bad movie. 
And a fighter . . . a fighter can never lose." 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite subjects, boxing's history and his boxing film collection, 
came up. He spoke of Panama Al Brown, the 1930s bantamweight he admires. 
</P>
<P>
"A very interesting guy to watch," Tyson said. "He was tall and skinny. Most 
tall, skinny guys move around a lot. He was aggressive. He came after you." 
</P>
<P>
He admires the 1950s and '60s middleweights, and he mentioned Joey Giardello, 
Dick Tiger and Gene Fullmer. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of weeks before the (Carl) Williams fight (last July 21, in Atlantic 
City), I'm jumping rope in the gym and this old guy is looking at me. I saw him 
in the mirror. It was Giardello. I recognized him immediately. I said to him: 
'If I'd fought in the 1950s, how would I have done?' He told me I'd have done 
great, and it meant a lot, for him to say it." 
</P>
<P>
He was asked if the constant media attention might lead to an early retirement 
from boxing. "Well, not much longer," he said. "Maybe five years. Sometimes, 
you know what I mean, you get that feeling that you need to get away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Someone asked him about his friend, Darryl Strawberry, the New York Met 
outfielder who recently checked into a rehabilitation program. Tyson was 
annoyed by the subject of athletes and public announcements of drug and alcohol 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate that," he said. "A guy stands up and announces, 'Hey, I got a problem 
here.' Those kinds of problems . . . Show some character, man, you know what I 
mean? You solve those kinds of problems at home. Come on, it's character. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, a guy admits his problem to everyone, and then just because he's gone 
public with it, it's supposed to be all nice and shiny? Come on. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever see Beau Jack on films? Now there was character and courage. One time Cus 
(the late Cus D'Amato, who discovered Tyson) showed me a film of Beau Jack in a 
fight when he broke his leg. 
</P>
<P>
"He actually tried to move around by putting both hands on his broken leg and 
trying to move it. In another film, Beau Jack was taking a terrible beating and 
he absolutely wouldn't quit. Beau Jack wound up shining shoes in Miami, but Cus 
always tipped his cap to Beau Jack when he saw him. Cus was very big on 
character and courage, and so am I. 
</P>
<P>
"All the champions, starting with John L. Sullivan, even if you don't like 
them, you have to respect them." 
</P>
<P>
Strange, isn't it, that a champion who can talk for an hour about character 
can, a day later, show up 23 minutes late for a televised news conference and 
utter a four-letter expletive into a microphone? 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who is almost always pleasant and cordial in gatherings of small groups 
of reporters, is almost always sullen and antagonistic at news conferences. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it, all those stupid questions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he walked into a large room where about 500 Japanese reporters had been 
waiting, Tyson was scowling. 
</P>
<P>
His disposition didn't improve at his introduction, when the female translator 
announced: "Ladies and gentlemen, Iron Mike Tyson is entering the room at this 
very moment!" 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the questions from the Japanese reporters, one of which was: 
"Do you think you will win?" 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's answers to such questions were barely audible, one-syllable responses. 
He put on a headset and briefly listened to music. He tapped his fingers loudly 
and impatiently on the table. 
</P>
<P>
He became even more irritated when an English-speaking reporter rose to ask if 
the rumors that he was seeing a Tokyo psychologist were true. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not true," Tyson answered angrily, then launched into a confusing 
explanation of mental preparation for boxing and concluded by saying: "If you 
can't fight, you're . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The remark was sanitized by the translator, leaving the Japanese reporters 
wondering why the English-speaking reporters seemed shocked. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Television has a hospitality room here, where it shows all of its taped 
news coverage of Tyson's Tokyo activities. One tape shows Tyson running alone 
in the darkness, around the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The video is apparently shot by a cameraman on a bicycle. Tyson pretends not to 
notice. He finishes his run, enters the hotel, and walks through the empty 
lobby, toward the elevators. And the cameraman, walking now, is still dogging 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Tyson angrily whirls about and with both hands indicates that the 
cameraman should stop, turn off his lights, and go away. 
</P>
<P>
The camera lights are shut off and we see the champion walking on, into 
darkness.

Loyola Marymount wasted little time in making -- then correcting -- its first 
error of the season, on the cover of its baseball media guide. 
</P>
<P>
The original cover had a photograph of six gray-haired Loyola players, all of 
whom are in their senior year of eligibility, sitting in wheelchairs and 
leaning against walkers, over the caption, "The Senior League Comes to LMU." 
</P>
<P>
"It was intended as a takeoff on the new senior (professional) league in 
Florida," Loyola Coach Chris Smith said. "We wanted to do a takeoff on the fact 
that we had so many seniors." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, however, struck out in their execution. 
</P>
<P>
After about 200 guides had been distributed to program supporters and some 
members of the media, school administrators decided to change the theme of the 
cover -- at considerable expense. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to act prudently," Loyola Athletic Director Brian Quinn said. 
"Rather than risking offending anyone, we decided to pull it." 
</P>
<P>
The new cover has a photo of preseason All-American catcher Miah Bradbury and 
pitchers Steve Surico and Darryl Scott above the caption, "The Lions' 
Ever-Ready Battery." 
</P>
<P>
Paying dividends: Income from increased ticket sales, radio rights and a 
reported $500,000 paid by CBS to televise the championship game helped last 
season's College World Series turn a record profit of $423,249. 
</P>
<P>
And, although college baseball probably will never generate the million-dollar 
payouts schools receive for participating in football and basketball, the money 
is getting better for those that travel the road to Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach, for example, earned $37,426 for reaching the eight-team 
double-elimination tournament, where the 49ers were ousted after two games. 
</P>
<P>
Defending national champion Wichita State and Texas, the series' finalists, 
each received $62,376. Florida State and Louisiana State each earned $49,901. 
Arkansas and Miami each got $43,663, and North Carolina took home $37,426. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, Loyola and USC, who all played in regional tournaments, received 
$8,300 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Home sweet home: Cal State Long Beach was a team of vagabonds last season, 
practicing on Pony League fields and playing home games at Cerritos College and 
Blair Field while its campus facility was being overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach Dave Snow figured that the us-against-the-world attitude, 
which the situation fostered, helped motivate his team to the school's best 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are back on campus this season, and Snow is hoping the comforts of 
home won't dull their competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
The new 49er Field has an excellent playing surface and a seating capacity of 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Corey Johnson said seating capacity will be expanded to 2,500 
during the next few years. Lights, locker rooms and offices will also be added. 
</P>
<P>
Power play: Scott Sharts was sporting a black eye and a swollen nose that 
resulted from an encounter with a ground ball in practice, but he was feeling 
no pain last week after hitting a two-run home run in the eighth inning that 
helped Cal State Northridge defeat USC in the season opener for both teams, 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
Sharts, a 6-foot-4, 221-pound sophomore first baseman, transferred to 
Northridge from Miami last summer, intent on proving that he could still 
produce the power that generated a Southern Section-record 32 homers when he 
played at Simi Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Sharts played in 22 games for Miami, batting .222 with no homers 
and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"People know me as a hitter, and that's what I'm here for," Sharts said after 
the USC game. "I'm going to prove all those (Miami) guys wrong. By the end of 
the year, they're going to say, 'This guy can hit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Early start: Pepperdine and Loyola, which traditionally did not begin play in 
the West Coast Conference until March, opened their WCC schedules Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The WCC has switched from a 24- to a 36-game format that calls for a 
home-and-home series with each conference opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, the defending champion, is playing a three-game series against USF. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola is at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
USC and UCLA begin their Pacific 10 Southern Division schedules next Friday 
against Arizona State and Stanford, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Reinstated: Four Arkansas baseball players linked to a gambling investigation 
last fall have had their eligibility restored by the NCAA, but they will miss 
the first 16 games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Relief pitchers Phil Stidham and Mark Swope, both of whom were All-Southwest 
Conference in 1989; outfielder Haden Etheridge, and pitcher Gary Harris had 
been ruled ineligible by the school after their names appeared on betting slips 
found during a raid of a bookmaking operation last November in Fayetteville, 
Ark. 
</P>
<P>
The players will be allowed to practice with the team while their suspensions 
are in force. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas shared the Southwest Conference championship with Texas A&amp;M last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
College Baseball Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC center fielder John Jackson joined the Trojans this week after missing the 
first three games while attending NFL scouting combines. Jackson, a preseason 
All-American who was a record-setting wide receiver for the Trojan football 
team, led the Pac-10 Southern Division in batting last season. . . . USC 
outfielder Corey Aurand suffered a torn rotator cuff in practice three weeks 
ago and will miss the entire season. Aurand, a senior, will red-shirt.

VITALE: MIND-BLOWING, T.O.-ING, ON-THE-GO-ING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Last week was a fairly typical one for Dick Vitale, a guy who never met a 
modifier he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
Over to you, Dickie Baby. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, baby, better take a T.O. pronto to listen to this absolutely, amazingly 
brilliant inside info on the fantastic beauty of college basketball," Dickie 
Baby said. "It just blows my mind." 
</P>
<P>
All right, so Vitale didn't actually say that, but he could have. Tune in a 
college hoop game just about any night of the week, either on ABC or ESPN, and 
you're going to hear him say a whole lot of things about a whole lot of things. 
</P>
<P>
Tracked down at his home in Bradenton, Fla., Vitale took a brief T.O. -- 
timeout, to the uninitiated -- to review the state of the game and where he has 
been and will soon be discussing it. The travel schedule looked daunting, but 
not in Vitalian terms. 
</P>
<P>
Vitale began with a game on Sunday in Champaign, Ill., an ABC matchup between 
Indiana and Illinois. Monday night, Vitale put on a mike for ESPN in Evanston, 
Ill., for Purdue and Northwestern. Wednesday night, he was in Chapel Hill, 
N.C., for North Carolina State against North Carolina on ESPN. Then he went 
home to Bradenton. 
</P>
<P>
Vitale's weekend itinerary includes an Illinois-Michigan game for ABC Sunday in 
Ann Arbor, Mich., preceded by a speech today for the Washington Speakers Bureau 
in Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old 1962 Seton Hall graduate is developing quite a following for 
what he does on television. While Vitale may not be everybody's cup of java, 
well, remember, basketball is supposed to be fun, and Dickie Baby is humorous, 
if nothing else. Love him or loathe him, Vitale is having a ball. He explained 
his feelings in a typical Vitale stream-of-consciousness soliloquy. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely love what I am doing," Vitale said. "To get paid handsomely, sit 
at courtside, people mailing me T-shirts with my picture on it now, it was 
amazing, down in Iowa just recently, all the kids had face-masks on, made of 
Dick Vitale, go to Wisconsin, the Bleacher Creatures had my name spelled out on 
the front of the T-shirts they were wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Try to imagine how this makes Vitale feel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just blown my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that some might wonder if such a thing truly has occurred 
already, Vitale said he is thrilled to the gills to be living in the old U.S. 
of A. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people all the time, only in America could a guy who can't speak 
English make a living on TV, a guy who can't write a sentence have a book that 
makes the best-seller list. We've got the greatest country in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Vitale began his broadcasting career with ESPN in 1979 after he was fired in 
his second season of coaching the Detroit Pistons. A former high school 
basketball coach in East Rutherford, N.J., Vitale was later an assistant at 
Rutgers and the coach for four years at the University of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
But talking, not coaching, is Vitale's real love. Some samples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the NCAA tournament: "It's Russian roulette, the one-game shot. You 
don't have four out of seven, it's one game, baby, roll it, play it, bad day, 
pack the bags, go home." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Oregon State's Gary Payton: "I've always liked Rumeal Robinson as my 
point guard, but based on numbers and looking at the achievements of Payton, I 
have to say, 'Move over, Rumeal, baby. You've got to move over. It's got to be 
Gary Payton.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Loyola Marymount's Bo Kimble: "He's starting to send a message out he's 
for real. He can shoot the rock. He can stroke it, shoot it, just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Purdue Coach Gene Keady (also UCLA's Jim Harrick): "He's done an 
absolutely brilliant job." 
</P>
<P>
And so on. How long can this go on? Better figure for as long as the season 
lasts. And what kind of season is it, Dickie Baby? 
</P>
<P>
"Wild, zany, unpredictable -- you can't project who to project," Vitale said. 
"It just blows my mind." 
</P>
<P>
More Vitale: He doesn't believe that USC Coach George Raveling will leave at 
the end of the season to take the coaching job at Miami. Vitale said he thinks 
Raveling is determined to accomplish something positive at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been an amazing story for me, probably one of the biggest enigmas and 
mysteries that I see in college basketball over the last five years," Vitale 
said. "I thought it was Lock City for big-time basketball when George Raveling 
was named coach at USC. I thought that was a perfect marriage. I thought he was 
made to order for the whole scenario. 
</P>
<P>
"He just hasn't been able to get the break, the golden chance. Maybe, my 
feeling is, the win over UCLA, if they can build on that, that could be a 
stepping stone. I'm a believer in George. I think the guy is really a great 
salesman, a great communicator, a great motivator. And if they get O'Bannon . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
Vitale was referring to the highly regarded Ed O'Bannon of Artesia High. 
</P>
<P>
Geometry lesson: Wake Forest Coach Dave Odom employed a triangle-and-two 
defense in an attempt to take away the three-point shooting of Georgia Tech's 
Dennis Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets' Brian Oliver hit seven three-point shots in 10 attempts and 
scored 31 points in a 79-70 victory. Scott scored 17 points, despite a bruised 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"It backfired on us," Odom said. 
</P>
<P>
And the reaction of Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Cremins? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a pretty good gamble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Young and restless: Yes, Indiana Coach Bobby Knight has six blue-chip freshmen 
on his team. No, Knight isn't wait patiently for them to mature. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's all bull," Knight told Skip Myslenski of the Chicago Tribune. 
"Now, let me ask you a question. As long as you've been around sports, do you 
think that coaches as a group are as protective about their futures as any 
group you've been around? 
</P>
<P>
"See, I do. It's 'We're too young.' 'We're not big enough.' 'We're not deep 
enough.' There are more reasons why we aren't going to be good enough, but none 
of them to me are acceptable. We lost not because we were young, but because we 
didn't handle the ball well. You may say that's because we're young. I don't 
believe that. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose because you play badly, not because you're young, or not big or not 
deep. All those are excuses, not reasons."

OIL STAINS 12 MILES OF ORANGE COUNTY COAST; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: TANKER SPILL NOW THREATENS MAJOR WILDLIFE REFUGES. WINDS 
COMPLICATE CLEANUP EFFORTS AS SLICK MOVES AS FAR NORTH AS SEAL BEACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Driven by shore-bound winds, the slick from a 300,000-gallon oil spill reached 
miles of new beaches in Orange County on Friday, threatening major wildlife 
refuges and confounding cleanup crews working frantically to contain the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The brown and black goo was reported washing ashore as far north as Seal Beach, 
near the sensitive Bolsa Chica wetlands and a federal wildlife reserve at the 
Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. Both are prime nesting habitats for dozens of 
birds, including some of the state's largest concentrations of least terns and 
light-footed clapper rails, both endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst of it is here," said Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays after 
touring the coast by helicopter at dusk Friday. "When I was flying over the 
city between Beach Boulevard and the lifeguard headquarters, it looked black 
down on the beach as the stuff rolled in." 
</P>
<P>
Oil was reported washing ashore at various locations along a 12-mile stretch of 
coastline as portions of the widening slick broke away. Several fingers of the 
slick were within two miles of Long Beach Harbor, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor remained closed, but by late Friday the 18-square-mile slick had 
reversed its course, heading north toward the wetlands at Huntington Beach and 
Seal Beach where officials feared that protective booms might not contain the 
advancing oil. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers were used to build a sand dike at the Santa Ana River mouth near the 
Huntington Beach wetlands, and flushing channels that lead to the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, farther north, were sealed shut. Biologists warned that the oil could 
devastate wildlife in the nesting areas if any infiltrates the fragile coastal 
estuaries. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for damage and harm is enormous," said Victor Leipzig, executive 
director of the Bolsa Chica Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Experts also predicted that the spilled oil may also start emulsifying, thereby 
doubling in volume. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investigators revealed Friday that an anchor punctured the hull of 
the tanker American Trader at least twice as the 811-foot vessel positioned 
itself to connect with an oil pipeline in water so shallow that the ship could 
have struck the bottom. However, no oil leaked from the second gash in the 
tanker, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it (the ship) rode up over its anchor and punctured on it," 
Coast Guard Adm. J. William Kime told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said divers late Thursday found the second hole near the 
starboard bow of the U.S.-registered tanker. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, laden with millions of gallons of oil, attempted to position itself 
off Huntington Beach to unload its cargo of crude to send to a mainland 
refinery when one of its 12-ton anchors punctured the hull, exposing two of the 
oil-filled holds. 
</P>
<P>
Marine experts said Friday that a ship striking its own anchor is the mariner's 
equivalent of shooting oneself in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty embarrassing when you hit your own anchor," said George 
Oberholtzer, director of the National Spill Control School at Texas State 
University in Corpus Christi. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the American Trader, supervised by Coast Guard officials, were 
pumping out the remaining oil in the damaged holds Friday to prevent further 
spillage. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn Friday, professional cleanup crews in gloves and yellow slickers were 
scattered along a half-mile stretch of sand near Newport Pier. Many residents, 
angered at the tanker accident and the threat to local beaches, joined the 
effort, wading into the surf line and dabbing the fouled waters and sand with 
absorbent cloth pads. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, volunteers outnumbered paid workers, creating problems and 
prompting officials to issue a public plea to stay away from local strands, 
most of which were closed from Newport to Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very disturbing to see this and to experience it," said Patti Harris, a 
Costa Mesa resident. "I feel as though my personal environment has been 
violated. Now, maybe with all the (media) coverage, politicians will get off 
their duffs and protect us." 
</P>
<P>
In a lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court on Friday, two state 
sportfishing organizations blamed British Petroleum and tanker owner American 
Trading Transportation Co. for causing more than $1 billion in damage to 
wildlife and beach property. 
</P>
<P>
The Sportfishing Assn. of California and United Anglers of California alleged 
that the shipping company and British Petroleum were negligent and have held 
back resources in the cleanup effort to save money. The suit seeks an 
unspecified amount in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Lehman, a risk manager for British Petroleum, denied the allegations 
Friday night, contending that "both companies have committed substantial 
resources to clean up the oil spill." 
</P>
<P>
At least nine skimming vessels worked to recover the oil. But by late Friday 
only 7% -- about 500 barrels -- of the oil patch had been scooped up, and 
experts predicted that at some point, much of it would probably come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 60% of the slick was still drifting off the coast, and it would 
take days -- if not weeks -- to clean it up under the most ideal conditions -- 
if ocean waters stay relatively calm and winds light. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident is tragic," said John Turner, director of the U.S. Interior 
Department's division of wildlife services, who was at Huntington Beach State 
Park. "There's a considerable amount of spill out there. You don't ever become 
adequately prepared to clean up the area. Nobody could ever become adequately 
prepared to clean up real stuff. It's that hard." 
</P>
<P>
At least 49 birds were found fouled by oil and taken to a wildlife aid station 
as of Friday. A dozen or so of those have died, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
During a press tour Friday morning, about 30 oil-fouled seals were perched on 
some of the cylinders in the pipeline mooring area, which contained some of the 
thickest and most concentrated portions of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials said they have not determined who is responsible for the 
spill. But the investigation is continuing into the events surrounding the 
mooring of the 21-year-old tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Tanker crew members told investigators that the American Trader drifted back 
over the anchor, and the chain apparently wrapped around the bow, according to 
Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Alan Carver. As the crew raised the anchor to try another 
mooring, officials believe it struck the hull on the starboard side, leaving a 
three-foot gash and two other holes. 
</P>
<P>
Mooring a tanker for unloading is a two- to three-hour process that involves 
coaxing the ship into a 700-foot-wide, U-shaped cluster of seven buoys. During 
the operation, the ship typically cuts across the mouth of the "U," laying one 
anchor, then the other, before reversing its engines to swing the stern into 
the slot. 
</P>
<P>
A mooring master, the equivalent of a pilot, directs the procedure from the 
bridge of the tanker and is assisted by a mooring launch cruising the waters 
around the ship. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Keon, 41, of San Jacinto was the mooring master aboard the American 
Trader when the spill occurred. Coast Guard officials said that Keon and Capt. 
Robert La Ware tested negative for alcohol use and that results of drug tests 
are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Keon, who is self-employed, has worked as a pilot at the Huntington Beach 
mooring for five years. He has been a sailor for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you one thing, the guy wasn't drunk," said Bill Freese, who lives 
half a block from Keon. "I have never seen him with anything stronger than a 
cup of coffee. He is very dedicated, a real family man and a churchgoing guy." 
</P>
<P>
La Ware, who has worked for American Trading Transportation Co. for 30 years, 
is an experienced captain on the West Coast. Contacted at the ship Friday 
afternoon, La Ware declined to comment except to say, "I'm holding up just 
fine, thanks." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said Friday that the draft of the tanker was 42 to 47 feet below the 
water level. Its anchors are at least 10 feet long, and the ship was attempting 
to moor at low tide just before 5 p.m. Wednesday when the water depth was 
"50-plus feet," a Coast Guard official said. "It had the potential of being 
right on the bottom.' 
</P>
<P>
The water's depth around the mooring can range from 52 to 75 feet, depending on 
the swell and tide. Tidal charts indicate that the low tide was 1.3 feet below 
normal at 4:06 p.m. Wednesday, shortly before the spill. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum, operators of the vessel, said Friday that its crews had 
already gathered 800 trash bags full of oil-soaked cleanup pads from the beach. 
Spokesmen said they may ask volunteers to stop helping in the cleanup because 
of liability problems. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, federal and state officials ruled against the use of toxic 
chemical dispersants to break up the slick.

HOW THE ANCHOR HIT 
</P>
<P>
The American Trader was maneuvering into a sea berth off Huntington Beach to 
offload oil when it apparently smacked its anchor, ripping two holes in its 
hull, spilling 300,000 gallons of crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
1. Swells rocked ship in shallow water.

2. The vessel drifted over port anchor, wrapping the chain around its bow. As 
crew raised port anchor, officials believe it struck starboard side of hull, 
leaving three-foot gash and another hole. 
</P>
<P>
3. Some veteran pilots suspect the tanker struck the anchor as it rested on sea 
floor in shallow water.

WEAK E. GERMAN MARK DRAINS BLOOD BANKS

<P>
The earning power of the West German mark, largely blamed for East Germany's 
wave of emigration, is now draining its blood banks. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin's 28 hospitals were short 3,000 blood donations at the end of 
January because about 500 regular donors had begun selling their blood to 
hospitals in West Berlin for West German marks, the official news agency ADN 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The West German Red Cross paid $27 for each donation in West Berlin. In East 
Berlin, hospitals paid $29 in East German marks, but the East mark in reality 
is virtually worthless in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely very seductive (West German mark payments), but this blood is 
really needed in our own hospitals," ADN quoted Henn Roigas, senior medical 
officer for East Berlin's blood donation and transfusion institute, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's hospitals are also desperately short of qualified personnel such 
as nurses because of the continuing emigration, causing serious breakdowns in 
availability and quality of medical care.

SUSPECTED SWEATSHOPS ARE RAIDED;

<P>
Labor and welfare fraud inspectors swooped down on suspected garment sweatshops 
Friday, finding labels from half a dozen prominent clothing companies in three 
private homes, seizing unfinished garments and citing one shop for an alleged 
child-labor violation. 
</P>
<P>
One manufacturer said he was "incensed" to hear that his label had been found 
in a squalid back-yard shed, along with a cot and two sewing machines. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm crazed over this because they have absolute instructions that none of my 
merchandise ever goes into anything resembling a sweatshop," said Barry Forman, 
owner of D.K. Forman, whose clothing is sold in top department stores. 
</P>
<P>
The label, which reads "Deborah Barry for D.K. Forman, Proudly Made in U.S.A.," 
was found in the shed behind a home raided by authorities on a tip about 
illegal home sewing. 
</P>
<P>
It is a violation of state and federal law to sew women's garments in homes. 
But labor authorities say they have repeatedly found clothing brands sold in 
posh stores being sewn in Orange County homes, often by immigrant women -- and 
sometimes children -- earning less than the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the shed at the Santa Ana home, Catholic icons looked down on two sewing 
machines, a rumpled cot, fabric scrap, tangles of old thread and the labels. 
But the occupant insisted the sewing machines did not belong to her. 
</P>
<P>
Among the labels were Betty &amp; Sheila Garments, a Los Angeles-based junior 
sportswear and dress manufacturer; Contempo Casuals Inc. of Los Angeles, a 
retail chain owned by Neiman Marcus Group Inc., and Wet Seal Inc., an 
Irvine-based retail chain with 73 stores in California, Arizona and Nevada and 
sales of $79 million in fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Wet Seal Inc. President Ken Chilvers said retail chains such as his often 
contract to have private-label clothing made for them by other garment 
manufacturers and usually have no idea where their garments are sewn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to try to track it back and find out exactly who it was," 
Chilvers said. "We'll do what any responsible company would do, which is try to 
put a stop to it." 
</P>
<P>
Betty &amp; Sheila President Deborah Kattler said that she had "no idea" how 
her label made its way to the shed but that she would never be a party to any 
of her 10 or 15 contractors farming her goods out to be made elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something my company approves of, supports or encourages," Kattler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Contempo Casuals officials could not be reached for comment Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's raid was one of periodic spot checks jointly conducted by state labor 
inspectors and the welfare fraud unit of the Orange County district attorney's 
office. Fraud officials check that welfare recipients who are earning money on 
the side report their sewing income. Labor inspectors make sure garment workers 
are being paid properly, check for child-labor violations and crack down on 
home-sewing operations. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Labor Commissioner Craig Cubberly said that since 1987 he has 
levied $45,000 in fines on garment sweatshops for minimum wage, overtime and 
child-labor violations involving children ages 13 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers can also be fined if their sewing contractors are found 
underpaying workers or having clothing sewn at home -- but only after repeat 
offenses and if it can be shown that they knew of the labor violations. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, however, Cubberly and his colleague Jesse Atilano cited two Garden 
Grove sewing shops in an industrial complex off Euclid Street. Both were sewing 
dresses and jackets for the All That Jazz label owned by Chorus Line Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Fashion was fined $1,000 for inaccurate time records after Atilano 
noticed that nine of 10 workers' time cards had been punched at exactly 10:01 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical," Atilano said. "These gentlemen told me they have been here 
since 8 a.m. working." 
</P>
<P>
The owner, who identified herself as Ne Thi Tien, said the workers had simply 
forgotten to punch in. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, Fashion Quality was fined $100 after a 17-year-old worker was found 
behind the machines and $600 for six workers who had no time cards, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After a federal labor investigation last fall, Queens Fashions, another 
contractor in the same complex that was also sewing All That Jazz, agreed to 
repay workers for alleged minimum wage and overtime violations. But Queens 
Fashion had closed its doors Friday, and a new sewing shop had opened in the 
same spot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to kick their tail bones," said Chorus Line Inc. Controller Jim 
Hogan, when told of the latest fines. "We'll tell them to clean up their act or 
they're not going to get any more work from us." 
</P>
<P>
Hogan dismissed the argument, by its contractors and other sewing shop owners, 
that manufacturers pay them so little for each garment that they cannot 
possibly pay their workers the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't help it if they run an inefficient shop," Hogan said. "If they can't 
make money at the prices we pay them, then they should not accept the work. We 
are not trying to beat them out of any kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
Hogan said the company has 80 contractors in greater Los Angeles and that only 
the three in Orange County have been cited for labor violations. 
</P>
<P>
In two other home sweatshops Friday, officials confiscated batches of clothing 
that their owners later said were being sewn for the Bee Darlin' and Paris 
Sport Club labels. Those companies could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A small boy watched impassively as inspectors questioned his mother and counted 
scores of partially sewn dresses that had been stuffed in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
Though the kitchen wall behind her industrial sewing machine was gray with 
wear, and a special fluorescent light had been installed above her head, the 
woman, who receives welfare assistance, stuck to her denials. 
</P>
<P>
"She's saying she's only been sewing since yesterday, doesn't know who she's 
sewing for, and doesn't know who owns the clothes," Cubberly said in 
frustration. "And they haven't told her yet what she (will be paid). 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting the truth here, but that's nothing new."

Shoppers at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa were asked at random Friday for 
their thoughts on the disaster involving the tanker, the American Trader, and 
the spill of 300,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
GAIL L. NICORA 
</P>
<P>
37, of Santa Ana, a collection coordinator for a pharmaceutical company, says: 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to know why they had to unload that tanker when the swells were 
high. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
JANE C. SCHATTKE 
</P>
<P>
29, of Laguna Nigel, a chemist: 
</P>
<P>
"It's careless. . . . It's the consumers who pay in the end, and the 
environment as well."

<P>
MARIO J. CASSAR 
</P>
<P>
20, a diamond consultant and model from Huntington Beach: 
</P>

"There's a lot of wildlife gone already. And that's not fair. I think we should 
keep the ocean clean." 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES V. HICKEN 
</P>
<P>
54, a professional fund-raiser from Sacramento: 
</P>
<P>
"I think they ought to assess the heaviest fines they can. . . . (But) how do 
you levy a fine against such enormous wealth? It means nothing. I don't know 
what they can do. But they ought to do something." 
</P>
<P>
PHILIP CHAMPLIN 
</P>
<P>
50, a Superior Court judge in Napa: 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're probably going to have to start double-hulling ships. It just 
points out the vulnerability of the fleet. The potential of devastating the 
shoreline of a tourist area like this points out the need for greater 
precaution." 
</P>
<P>
SUSAN J. MIRSHAHZADEH 
</P>
<P>
37, a mother who lives in Anaheim: 
</P>
<P>
"It's disgusting. . . . I think it's disgusting in general with what they're 
doing with the ecological system of this planet. It's just another example. 
We're making the world uninhabitable." 
</P>
<P>
BOB W. NICORA 
</P>
<P>
50, of Santa Ana, who works in research in a pharmaceutical company: 
</P>
<P>
"It seems as if the oil companies haven't developed the contingency plans to 
make sure these spills don't happen. . . . And I think the government hasn't 
stepped in." 
</P>

JEFF B. THOMPSON 
</P>
<P>
25, of Huntington Beach, an account representative for a Seal Beach printing 
company he said has sent 25 employees to help with the cleanup:

"It's pretty horrible. But I think it's neat to see all the support the 
community is giving."

'HUMDINGER' TRAFFIC SNARL IS FORECAST

<TEXT>
<P>
Repair work that will temporarily shut down half of Del Obispo Street in the 
heart of town will create "a humdinger" of a traffic jam, Mayor Gary Hausdorfer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 37,000 vehicles a day cross the railroad tracks at Del Obispo just west 
of Camino Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
From Feb. 26 to March 2, the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. and 
the city will repair the railway crossings and the street leading up to them. 
Del Obispo will remain open, but only one lane each way. 
</P>
<P>
Three other intersections in the city and surrounding area also are scheduled 
for repair work: Oso Road, Feb. 25-26; La Zanja Street, March 4; and Avenida 
Aeropuerto, March 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who's a little bit late will be a lot late on those days if they travel 
this way," Hausdorfer said. "We suggest everyone make plans to use alternate 
routes." 
</P>
<P>
Signs and blinking lights will be placed on Del Obispo starting Thursday to 
warn motorists of the detour, said Bill Murphy, the city's public works 
director. 
</P>
<P>
The railroad will pay for replacing the tracks and crossing surfaces as part of 
a project to upgrade track throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
But the City Council this week allocated $90,000 for its share of the project, 
including traffic control, replacing and restriping streets and sidewalks, and 
public notification. LEN HALL

<P>
The people who live in Wilshire Square say their neighborhood is much like 
television's fictional town of Mayberry, home of Sheriff Andy Taylor, Opie and 
Aunt Bee. 
</P>
<P>
It is the kind of neighborhood where people know each other, socialize, bring 
chicken soup when someone is sick and share the fruit off their trees. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what a neighborhood is supposed to be like," said Ricki Older, an 
8-year resident and co-chairman of the Wilshire Square Neighborhood Assn. "If 
someone needs help changing a light bulb, you help. If they need a ride 
somewhere, you give them a ride. We've helped each other with everything from 
yard work to painting fences." 
</P>
<P>
The tree-lined neighborhood with period concrete lampposts is only blocks from 
downtown Santa Ana. Yet this is a place that has managed to change very little 
with time. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Square is 650 homes, most of which were built between the 1920 and 
1950, and now worth about $200,000. It is bordered by McFadden, Main, Edinger 
and Flower streets. The homes boast a diversity of custom designs and 
architectural styles ranging from Tudor revival to Spanish colonial. 
</P>
<P>
Houses are characterized by massive signature windows, breakfast rooms, garages 
separate from the houses and large yards with fruits trees bearing lemons, 
oranges, figs, plums and even persimmons. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these houses were probably custom-made for the original owner," said 
Marc LaFont, also co-president of the neighborhood association and an 11-year 
resident. "You have to be willing to stand out from the crowd if you live here 
because no two homes in this neighborhood are the same." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood association, one of 16 in Santa Ana, was formed in 1987 to 
help preserve the area's rich history and maintain the charm of the 
neighborhood, LaFont said. The group produces a newsletter every two months and 
has even commissioned Wilshire Square T-shirts and sweat shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly meetings and social events have given the neighbors a chance to become 
friends -- and to become somewhat of a political force at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors were vocal in their opposition to the proposed installation of 
nine oversize billboards in the city and collected more than 300 signatures on 
petitions protesting them. Due to intense public opposition, both advertising 
companies seeking to install the billboards abandoned their plans on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Residents Doug and Deborah Gillen just won a battle with City Hall and 
prevented city crews from trimming a 70-year-old cedar tree in front of their 
house. The Gillens will hire a professional trimmer to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors also have spoken out about density in Santa Ana, blocked a plan 
to remove a large number of trees that make up what LaFont calls the 
neighborhood's "urban forest" and have rid their neighborhood of graffiti with 
an aggressive program. 
</P>
<P>
Their efforts have not gone unnoticed. On Feb. 7, they were honored by the 
Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society. 
</P>
<P>
They also were awarded a certificate of appreciation last year by Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) for outstanding service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
Plans are under way for "Welcome to Wilshire Square" markers at four sites, 
with the city paying for their installation. 
</P>
<P>
"What's really special about living here is that it's a neat cross-section of 
people," said LaFont, who runs his own public relations company. "We have 
lawyers, teachers and architects. We run the gamut from millionaires to the 
little old lady living next door." GREG HERNANDEZ

JUDGE REFUSES TO CUT ADULT STORE'S HOURS

<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge on Friday refused to limit the operating 
hours of a 24-hour adult bookstore and video arcade that city officials say is 
a magnet for crime, noise and litter. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John C. Wooley denied the city's attempt to force A-Z Books on Garden 
Grove Boulevard to limit its hours to between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Wooley did grant City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart B. Scudder's request that lacy curtains placed in peep-show booth 
doorways -- allegedly in violation of a city ordinance -- be removed. The judge 
gave A-Z operator W. Randall Welty until 4 p.m. Friday to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for limiting the store's hours, Scudder said A-Z is responsible for 
lewd conduct, automobile noise, discarded condoms and other problems reported 
by area residents. 
</P>
<P>
Wooley said the city lacks the evidence to restrict the store's hours but that 
the curtains are in violation of one of his previous orders that doors be 
removed from the booths. 
</P>
<P>
A trial on alleged violations of the city's peep show ordinance is set for 
April 9. JAMES TORTOLANO

Most local residents do their shopping in Long Beach or elsewhere, according to 
a city staff report, and city officials are looking for ways to encourage the 
townfolk to spend more money here. 
</P>
<P>
Per capita sales tax revenues for Seal Beach rank 27th in Orange County, city 
officials said. Seal Beach per capita sales tax revenue is only $40, while the 
countywide average is $118. 
</P>
<P>
Sales tax revenues in the city in 1987 increased only 2.5%, compared to a 
statewide average of 7.2% and a countywide average of 8.8%, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not capturing our purchasing power," City Manager Bob Nelson said. "We 
know that the family income in the city is fairly high, because we have the 
highest average rental cost in the county. We know that people have to have a 
fairly high income to live here, and yet we have one of the lowest per capita 
sales tax revenue figures in the county." 
</P>
<P>
The city's largest provider of sales tax revenue is Rossmoor Shopping Center, 
which generated about 40% -- or approximately $400,000 -- of the total revenue. 
Nelson recommended improving the shopping center, which meets requirements for 
economic blight under Redevelopment Agency standards. 
</P>
<P>
Problems in the Main Street shopping area were also addressed in the study. 
Members of the city's Ad Hoc Retail Sales Committee said the two main problems 
in the area were a shortage of parking and an ineffective tenant mix. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the committee reported that the area's operating hours were incompatible 
with the shopping habits of residents. Most stores in the area are open from 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m. A street survey showed that many residents prefer to shop in the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that a number of the business on Main Street are being run as if they 
were hobbies. Often, the hours are very unpredictable," Nelson said. "If 
shoppers could know that the stores they wanted to visit would be open, they'd 
be more likely to shop in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The 80-page report, which took four months to complete, was reviewed this week 
by the City Council and the Ad Hoc Retail Sales Committee. MICHELLE NICOLOSI

A revised plan for a controversial 37-acre development along Santiago Creek 
will go back to the City Council without any recommendation from the Orange 
Planning Commission, which had opposed the original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett-Ehline Development Co. of Anaheim wants to build 160 houses, a 
seven-acre shopping center and a 3.5-acre greenbelt with walkways and bicycle 
paths on the Santiago Creek Golf Course property. 
</P>
<P>
The plan has drawn criticism from the Santiago Creek Homeowners Assn., which 
wants the golf course to remain. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Planning Commission recommended that the City Council deny 
Burnett-Ehline's plan, but the council referred the project back to the 
commission after the plan was modified. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the plan included the extension of La Veta Avenue from Tustin 
Street to Cambridge Avenue, which many residents said would create noise and 
traffic. The developer's plan replaces the La Veta extension with a greenbelt 
area and reduces the number of houses from 180 to 160. 
</P>
<P>
Planning commissioners said Monday that they did not have time to thoroughly 
review the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not really sure about a lot of details because the plan was put together 
hastily," said Joan Wolff, senior project planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to reconsider the project on Feb. 20. SHANNON

CHP OFFICER HURT AS CYCLE HITS A DOG

<P>
A California Highway Patrol officer was seriously injured Friday when his 
motorcycle struck the carcass of a dog and he was thrown to the shoulder of the 
Santa Ana Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Ruben C. Barajas, 35, sustained a concussion, major chest injuries and 
abrasions. His condition was upgraded late Friday afternoon from serious to 
stable at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, a hospital representative said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 8:40 a.m. just south of Newport Boulevard, shortly 
after Barajas signaled a motorist to pull over, CHP Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
As the driver maneuvered onto the freeway shoulder, his sedan obscured Barajas' 
view of the carcass of a dog lying near the solid white line that separates the 
shoulder from the right lane. The officer, who was following closely behind the 
car, was traveling about 35 m.p.h., Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have enough time to stop and lost control of the motorcycle," 
Johnson said. "The car (tires) straddled the dog, and he couldn't see it." 
</P>
<P>
Barajas -- dressed in the standard CHP uniform of a helmet, knee-high boots, 
wool pants, a shirt, thick gloves and a long-sleeved, padded nylon jacket -- 
was thrown onto the freeway shoulder. The motorcycle landed in the far right 
lane of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably trying to check his side-view mirrors when he was pulling 
over, to protect himself and to slow traffic, and wasn't paying attention to 
the roadway under the car ahead," said CHP Officer Lyle Whitten of the 
Westminster station. 
</P>
<P>
At CHP headquarters in Sacramento, which keeps records of all state accidents 
involving officers in the line of duty, there were no recent reports of a 
similar accident, spokesman Steve Kohler said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual," Kohler said. "We've had reports of motorcycle officers 
hitting mufflers, tires and even a ladder. But there is nothing about dead 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
Barajas was planning to cite the motorist for driving on the shoulder of the 
northbound Costa Mesa Freeway, but first followed the vehicle onto the 
southbound Santa Ana Freeway "for safety reasons," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified motorist stopped and offered aid to Barajas after the 
accident, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Barajas served nine years with the CHP at its western Los Angeles station and 
has been a motorcycle patrol officer for eight years. He came to the Santa Ana 
CHP station four months ago, Officer Keith Thornhill said. 
</P>
<P>
No information was available on Barajas' driving record with the CHP. In the 
last 13 years, the CHP's 400 motorcycle officers have had no fatalities, 
Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation is responsible for removing dead 
animals and other debris from state and interstate highways. Work crews from 
the department arrived shortly after the accident to remove the dead dog, 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident early Friday afternoon, a Santa Ana police motorcycle 
officer was slightly injured while riding to work from his Rancho Santa 
Margarita home. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports said the unidentified officer was cut off when a driver turned 
left in front of him at the intersection of Via Flores and Marguerite Parkway. 
He was treated and released at Saddleback Community Hospital.

UCI WELCOMES GAY-LESBIAN FESTIVAL BUT HOUSING STILL FOR MARRIEDS ONLY

With students in the background protesting what they call discrimination 
against homosexuals, organizers for the Gay and Lesbian Festival said Friday 
that UC Irvine officials have agreed to allow the controversial fair to be held 
on campus this year. 
</P>
<P>
Students continued to camp out for a third day in a shantytown of cardboard 
boxes and sheets of plastic to protest a university policy that bars unmarried 
and gay and lesbian couples from university housing for families. Fifty yards 
away, festival organizers announced plans to hold the fair and parade at UCI on 
Aug. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the student protesters charged that the university was being 
inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
"Gay and lesbian couples cannot get (university) housing, but we can have a 
parade here," said Michelle Richards, a sophomore English major who slept 
overnight on the rumpled blankets outside the administration building to 
support the protesters. "There seems to be an inherent contradiction." 
</P>
<P>
University spokeswoman Linda Granell said Orange County Cultural Pride, the 
group of volunteers that staged the gay festival last year in Santa Ana, was 
invited to hold the event at UCI by the campus Gay and Lesbian Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing makes it so these two issues are viewed together, but they're 
really completely separate," Granell said. "One is a legal issue and the other 
is a student activity." 
</P>
<P>
Granell said the Gay and Lesbian Festival is welcome at UCI. But she said 
university family housing, which is moderately priced, is available only to 
legally married couples. Unmarried gay and lesbian couples cannot live at the 
860-unit Verano Place apartments on campus, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The first Gay and Lesbian Festival encountered virulent opposition last 
September when it was held at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana. A tense 
shouting match between fundamentalist Christians, and gays and lesbians erupted 
into a fist-swinging fracas that ended with six people arrested, from both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalist Christians subsequently launched a recall effort against six of 
the seven City Council members for allowing the park to be used. Petition 
organizers have until mid-March to get a recall ballot, said City Councilman 
John Acosta, who publicly opposed the festival and thus is the only council 
member not targeted by the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will not be held in Santa Ana because a new city law bans large public 
events that charge entrance fees, said festival spokeswoman Janet Avery. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they believe the second festival will not generate as much 
controversy, in part because of the new location. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take us a few more annual events before we're allowed to go and do our 
thing" without bringing out counterdemonstrators, predicted Connie Long, 
president of Orange County Cultural Pride. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, which mobilized the 
Christian demonstration last year, would not say whether they would demonstrate 
at this year's event, according to Steve Sheldon, the son of the group's 
founder, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
Security at the festival will be tightened this year, Avery said. She declined 
to be specific, but said police drawn from many of the nine UC campuses will 
cover the event.

Two people entered not guilty pleas Friday to charges of murder and conspiracy 
in the September death of a Newport Beach man who was beaten with baseball bats 
and sticks wrapped with tape, then shot in what police described as a revenge 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 people have been charged with murder, assault or conspiracy in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Frank Anaya, 21, of San Pedro, pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy 
and assault charges. Heather Rene Rose, 21, of Newport Beach, pleaded not 
guilty to conspiracy and assault. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown ordered Anaya and Rose to 
stand trial May 30. 
</P>
<P>
John David Fahey, 21, was beaten and shot to death Sept. 30 in front of a 
restaurant at Balboa Boulevard and 28th Street. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Rose, Fahey's neighbor, had fought with Fahey's female 
roommate the day before the killing, according to police. Police said Rose 
asked a few friends over to her apartment. Police said Rose told her roommate 
to expect some "guys coming over to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
Fahey and his other roommate, Brent Claxton, were leaving their apartment to go 
to a liquor store when they were attacked by a group of people. Claxton managed 
to escape unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
Three suspects in the case have already pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy 
to commit assault with a deadly weapon. They are Roman M. Woolem, 20, of San 
Pedro; Larry Pena, 24, of Long Beach; and Robert Pimental Jr., 20, also of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Woolem was sentenced to three years in prison on Feb. 6. Pena will be sentenced 
March 5. Pimental was ordered to appear for his sentencing in September. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they expect the first trial in the case, that of Tito Huizar, 
19, and Reynoldo Zepeda, 21, to begin next week. Both are from Long Beach and 
face the same charges as Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Lujan, 29, of Carson, and Richard Kirk Nogawa, 21, a UC Irvine sophomore, 
are scheduled to stand trial April 4. Both also face charges of conspiracy to 
commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
A 17-year-old youth was also arrested in the case. He is still in custody, 
according to police.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District recently released its annual 
list of companies emitting the largest volume of two pollutants -- reactive 
hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen. This list covers emissions during 1988.

REACTIVE HYDROCARBONS

These are produced by incomplete combustion of gasoline, and from fumes from 
fuels, paints, and industrial and dry-cleaning solvents. They are a prime 
ingredient in formation of ozone, the invisible, lung-irritating gas that is 
the main component of smog.

Canyon High School's entire wrestling team reached the finals as the Comanches 
cruised to their 10th consecutive Century League championship Friday night at 
the Canyon gym. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal all year was to ten-peat as champs," Canyon Coach Gary Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
The Comanches won nine of the 13 weight classes and qualified all of its 
wrestlers for next week's Southern Section 4-A tournament at Fountain Valley. 
"I'm really proud of these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon won the title with 248 points. El Modena, which also qualified 13 for 
the Southern Section tournament, finished second with 162 points. Santa Ana 
(four qualifiers, 67 points) was third followed by Santa Ana Valley (one, 52), 
Foothill (three, 44) and Villa Park (three, 41). 
</P>
<P>
"I knew we had the championship won after El Modena lost its third match in the 
semifinal round," Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's Zach Cooper (191 pounds), Jason Mitchell (138), Matt Padgett (154) and 
Bubba Perry (heavyweight) won their matches on pins. El Modena's Dan Wells 
(105) also won by a pin. 
</P>
<P>
Padgett broke a Canyon record with 33 pins this season. The previous record was 
28 by Victor Hakopian, who was legally blind, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In the final, Padgett (35-6) led, 10-1, over El Modena's Greg Hahn before 
pinning him in 2 minutes, 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I gained the advantage early after throwing Hahn out of bounds twice, then 
whatever he did I countered against," Padgett said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's John Williams pulled the upset of the tournament with an 11-4 
victory over Canyon's David Cha at 126 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Cha) pinned me in our dual meet, but I practiced keeping my hips and head 
up to avoid the pin," Williams said.

TITAN BASKETBALL ASSISTANT STARR RESIGNS

<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Starr, a Cal State Fullerton assistant basketball coach, has resigned 
effective immediately, the school announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, 35, had been a part-time assistant at Nevada Las Vegas for four years 
and had lived in Las Vegas for 12 years before being named at Fullerton in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at Fullerton said Starr missed Las Vegas and has returned there to look 
for a job, possibly outside of coaching. 
</P>
<P>
Starr could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will make changes in its starting lineup against Pacific tonight in 
an attempt to inject more offense, Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Agee Ward, who started at forward early in the season, will replace Van 
Anderson, Sneed said. Anderson will back up Cedric Ceballos, Sneed said, in a 
move designed to provide Ceballos with some rest during games. Ceballos played 
every minute of two overtime games last week. ROBYN NORWOOD

OIL SPILL BLACKENS DAY FOR FISHING, WHALE BOATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although it is the height of the whale-watching season and the weather is 
superb, boats that take sightseers to sea to hail the gray behemoths on their 
southerly swim to Baja California will probably remain moored this weekend in 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
They are blocked from entering the ocean by the same booms that have been 
placed at the mouth of the harbor to keep the oil out. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing, whale-watching and excursion boats stranded inside Newport Harbor so 
far seem to be the only casualties that the local tourism industry has 
sustained from this week's major oil spill off Huntington Beach. Otherwise, the 
spill is having virtually no impact on beach tourism, part of the county's 
$5.5-billion-a-year tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the disaster has "completely shut down" Jim Watts' sportfishing 
and whale-watching business since Wednesday evening, when access from the 
harbor to the sea was closed off. Watts, owner of Newport Landing Sportfishing, 
said Friday that he is concerned about losing business on what promises to be a 
sunny weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We can survive losing a few days during the week. But we can't survive losing 
weekends," he said. "All we are doing is holding our breath and wondering how 
long it is going to last." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Black, president of Catalina Passenger Service -- the only Catalina Island 
excursion operation in Newport Harbor -- said the company's 500-passenger 
catamaran, the Catalina Flier, also is grounded. He figured that he had lost 
about $15,000 in business Thursday and Friday and would lose about $12,000 more 
if he had to remain closed today. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Orange County Harbor Patrol spokesman said it is likely that the 
oil-containment booms would remain in place over the weekend, because some oil 
had been spotted just outside the harbor's west jetty. 
</P>
<P>
While the boat concessions in Newport Harbor are suffering, it is business as 
usual at hotels along the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Baker, director of the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau, 
is hoping there will be a bright "flip side" to the oil spill disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The oil slick does not seem to be harming the city's tourism industry, she 
said, and in fact the national exposure could give it an unexpected boost. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the pictures on television and Huntington Beach has a beautiful 
shoreline," she said. "It is gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said she contacted the city's 18 hotels on Thursday to see if they had 
received any cancellations due to the spill. The hotels, she said, reported 
they were busier than usual trying to accommodate curious sightseers and an 
onslaught of news reporters from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Bone, executive director of the Robert Mayer Corp., said he expects the 
oil spill to be just a memory by the scheduled July opening of the Waterfront 
Hilton hotel that the company is building as the first stage of a $600-million 
oceanfront commercial development in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go to the beaches now and see a marginal sheen at the shoreline, but 
there is no depth to it," he said. "It is a serious spill. But it is not a 
disaster. We have every confidence that any oil that does hit the beaches will 
be rapidly cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
Hotel representatives in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach also were optimistic 
about their chances of escaping virtually unscathed from the oil spill, which 
they expected to be cleaned up from the beaches well before the summer tourist 
boom. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter, they said, most of their clientele consists of business 
travelers and local recreational travelers looking for a getaway that does not 
include the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Assuming that they get it (the oil) cleaned up in a timely fashion, I can't 
see that it will affect anybody in this area," said Greg Smith, marketing 
director for the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Dusing, marketing director for the Hyatt Newporter, a 410-room resort hotel 
in Newport Beach, said, "My understanding is that it should be under control in 
a week and that a month from now it should be to the point that no one will 
realize anything happened." 
</P>
<P>
Like many others in the hotel business, Dusing said he is grateful that the oil 
spill was not as huge as the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful it didn't happen in July and August," during the peak tourist 
season, he said. "Then it would have had an effect on us."

$135 MILLION IN SHAM PROFITS CITED AT LINCOLN S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan generated $135 million in sham profits through 
overpriced sales of land to "straw" buyers, an accounting expert testified 
Friday in U.S. District Court here. 
</P>
<P>
About half of Lincoln's earnings between 1984 and its seizure by the government 
in 1989 came from the dubious sale of land in the Phoenix area, said Roger 
Johnson, a witness for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Lincoln's parent, is suing the federal 
government to overturn the seizure of the Irvine-based S&amp;L. Judge Stanley 
Sporkin is conducting a mini-trial dealing with some of the complex real estate 
and tax transactions. He is trying to determine whether American Continental 
should be entitled to a full trial on its complaint that regulators acted 
unfairly in seizing Lincoln in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who spent a full day on the stand for direct testimony and cross 
examination, said he was "shocked" by Lincoln's "contrived transactions" in the 
sale of land. The S&amp;L "ended up having more paper than cash" after its 
dealings with various companies, said Johnson, a partner with Kenneth Leventhal 
&amp; Co., an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
After examining 15 transactions for which Lincoln claimed $135 million, "I felt 
no profits should be booked," the accountant said. The buyers "did not have 
sufficient cash" in the properties purchased from Lincoln, he said. The buyer 
"has to have his own cash in the deal," and if the market goes bad, he will 
still be "motivated to complete the deal," according to the accountant. 
</P>
<P>
One of Lincoln's main land projects, the Hidden Valley ranch in an undeveloped 
section of Maricopa County west of Phoenix, is unlikely to be developed for the 
remainder of the century, Johnson testified. Lincoln bought the land at an 
average price of $3,000 an acre in 1985 and 1986, and began selling it at 
$16,000 an acre in 1987 and 1988, the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson described the complex transactions enabling Lincoln to record hefty 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, Lincoln had an appraisal on 1,000 acres of its Hidden Valley 
property saying the land was worth $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
On March 31, Lincoln sold the land to Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; 
Investment, or Westcon, for $14 million and recorded a profit of $11 million. 
Lincoln received a $3.5-million cash down payment and a note for $10.5 million 
from Westcon, a company that originally had a net worth of $30,000 and assets 
of $87,000. 
</P>
<P>
How could the buyer, Westcon, "service that type of debt?" Johnson wondered. 
</P>
<P>
On March 30, a day before the land sale to Westcon, Lincoln loaned $19 million 
in cash to E. C. Garcia Co., a Tucson development firm. E. C. Garcia, in turn, 
gave a $3.5-million loan to Westcon, providing the cash needed as down payment 
for buying the Hidden Valley land from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Westcon "was operating as a straw buyer . . . (with) none of their own cash 
involved," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, E. C. Garcia Co. assumed the $10.5-million note owed by Westcon 
to Lincoln. "I can find no evidence there was ever a payment by Westcon or 
Garcia on the $10.5-million note," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The accountant described another deal in which Lincoln sold $6 million worth of 
land to Hidden Valley Limited Partnership. The partnership "was basically a 
shell set up with $100 in capital," Johnson said, using funds transmitted 
through a series of transactions from American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
In all the complex cases, Lincoln's financial records "showed the form, not the 
substance," of real sales, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was "manufacturing profits by giving its money away," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Lincoln may ultimately cost the government $2 billion to 
liquidate or dismantle the institution, the costliest case in the massive wave 
of S&amp;L shutdowns. American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection last 
April 13, and Lincoln was seized by federal regulators the next day.

ON THE WATERFRONT: MIDWINTER REGATTA STILL ON DESPITE SPILL 
</P>

<P>
Larry Lewis' contingency plans for the giant Midwinter sailing regatta this 
weekend off the Orange County coast included everything -- except an oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the largest sailing regatta in the country, Lewis thought he had 
developed a strategy to deal with every foreseeable problem -- from gale-force 
winds to pea soup fog. 
</P>
<P>
"I just did not think of an oil spill," says Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the spill, Lewis says the 61st Annual Midwinter Regatta, a series of 
races from San Diego to Ventura, will not be canceled. "We will be monitoring 
the oil spill just as we will be monitoring the weather," he says. "And we will 
be in contact with the Coast Guard and will see what they recommend." 
</P>
<P>
Any decision to cancel individual sailing events will not be made until the 
final hours before the racing begins this morning, Lewis says. The spill of 
about 300,000 gallons off Huntington Beach should have no effect on the races 
scheduled for inside Newport Harbor, Lewis points out. 
</P>
<P>
As for the outside races, Lewis says that racecourses can be selected in 
different parts of the ocean to avoid the oil spill area. "If you get that kind 
of oil on your vessel, you can't get it off," he says. "It's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 Orange County sailors are expected to compete in races inside and 
outside Newport Harbor and in Dana Point. Overall, the regatta is expected to 
draw 1,000 Southern California sailors -- ranging from kids in sabots to 
Olympic hopefuls in oceangoing yachts. The regatta is sponsored by the Southern 
California Yachting Assn., an organization of 87 yacht clubs. 
</P>
<P>
This year, five of the 21 Midwinter events will be held in Orange County. "The 
regatta is done at multiple sites," Lewis says. "So you have simultaneous races 
taking place from Ventura to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The regatta began in the Los Angeles area and, over the years, spread along the 
entire Southern California coast, growing in popularity and size until it 
became the largest regatta in the country, according to vice chairman Doug Wall 
of Newport Beach. "This year we even have an SCYA club -- the Arizona Yacht 
Club -- involved in Arizona," Wall says. "They'll be racing on a lake near the 
Phoenix area." 
</P>
<P>
Also this year for the first time in Orange County, the American Legion Yacht 
Club in Newport Beach will be offering sailboard competition, according to 
Wall. "This is the first sailboarding outside the San Diego area," Wall says. 
"The regatta runs the whole gamut of boats from sailboards, sabots, Lasers and 
Lidos to 75-footers. And sailors range in age from kids to senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sailor Graham Gibbons, 54, says his entire family has sailed the 
Midwinters, including his wife, mother, sister and stepson, Olympic hopeful 
Nick Scandone, 23, who started out in sabots as a child. 
</P>
<P>
How did an off-season sailing event become the largest regatta in the country? 
</P>
<P>
Doug Wall believes that the Midwinters grew because winter is the only time of 
year when you can get so many sailors from so many different Southern 
California ports together at one time. "The racing calendar is so crowded that 
winter is the best opportunity," he says. "There are too many events on the 
calendar during the summer. Besides, in Southern California we have an 
opportunity to sail and race all year round." 
</P>
<P>
But even in Southern California, winter sailing can present some unpleasant 
challenges -- especially when the weather turns bad. "I can remember some 
really cold, miserable sails," says Graham Gibbons. "Often it will be quite 
stormy. I like summer better because the wind is more predictable." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach sailor Jack Baillie, who figures that he has raced in about 40 of 
the 61 Midwinter Regattas, remembers one year when it was so windy he decided 
that it was too dangerous to race so he dropped out just before crossing the 
starting line. By the time the race was over, Baillie knew he had made the 
right decision. "Two of my friends lost their masts," he says, "and one boat 
went on the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
The weather -- rather than racing tactics -- is a frequent topic of discussion 
among Midwinter veterans such as Baillie. "A friend of mine told me once that 
the toughest part of the racing was paddling the hail off the decks," Baillie 
says. "Sometimes it can get really cold out there." 
</P>
<P>
For Gil Knudson, a veteran of 15 regattas, it is neither the cold nor the wind 
that he remembers best -- it is the fog. "Once in the early '60s we raced the 
whole thing in the fog," says Knudson, who runs a marine hardware manufacturing 
company in Costa Mesa. "You couldn't even see the marks." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such memorable weather problems -- and despite this week's oil spill -- 
Jack Baillie expects to be racing in this year's Midwinters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned at first," Baillie says. "I thought the races would be 
canceled (because of the spill). But it's just a yacht race." 
</P>
<P>
As for getting crude oil on the varnished hull of Newsboy, his classic 65-foot 
sailboat, he says: "It is hard to get (crude) oil off a boat, but it is even 
harder to get it off a bird." 
</P>
<P>
For information on whether or not any events are being canceled because of the 
oil spill, Doug Wall recommends calling the individual yacht clubs hosting each 
race. The first of today's racing begins at 10:50 a.m. at the Capistrano Bay 
Yacht Club in Dana Point. The second event, sponsored by the Newport Harbor 
Yacht Club and Lido Isle Yacht Club, begins at 11:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County races are sponsored by the American Legion Yacht Club, 
Bahia Corinthian Yacht Club and Balboa Yacht Club. All three events get under 
way today at 11:50 a.m. Activities continue through Sunday, when awards 
ceremonies will be held at all 21 regatta sites.

LOVE ME TENDER?

At a card shop in the Mission Viejo Mall, two women in their 20s stand giggling 
before a display of valentines. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep picking up all of the sex ones. These are the perverted cards down 
here," the blonde says. "Do you think I should give this one to Ted?" 
</P>
<P>
She flips open a card that reads, "The first time ever I saw your face, I 
thought, 'Oh well, maybe he's got a nice personality.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those playing Cupid this Valentine's Day should choose their cards with care. 
Valentines can reveal more about the sender than the intended target of such 
sharp arrows. 
</P>
<P>
"When you pick a valentine, does it express who you are? I think it does," says 
David Coombs, a marriage and family counselor in Tustin who conducts seminars 
on "The Essentials of a Successful Marriage" at Irvine Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"Valentines may make you more transparent than you think," Coombs says. 
</P>
<P>
Choose a funny valentine, and you might be standoffish, afraid of intimacy or 
commitment, he says. Choose a sarcastic valentine, and you may be venting 
hidden hostilities. Choose a sentimental card, and you are probably in touch 
with your emotions and more likely to risk rejection. 
</P>
<P>
"When people choose a valentine, they have a particular image of themselves 
they want to convey," says Bob Fulkerson, a clinical psychologist in private 
practice in Huntington Beach. "The cards can show how well they like themselves 
and their outlook on life." 
</P>
<P>
A humorous card might get a laugh, for instance, but beneath the surface the 
sender may be trying to boost his sagging self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"They're making fun at somebody else's expense," Fulkerson says. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to today's cards, antique valentines drip with tender sentiments. The 
frilly lace concoctions are a far cry from modern ones, and the differences 
illustrate the radical changes that have taken place in society. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine's Day actually began in the year 270 when a young Roman priest named 
Valentinus was sentenced to die by Emperor Claudius II for refusing to renounce 
his Christian beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Legend has it that while in jail, Valentinus helped restore the sight of his 
jailer's 11-year-old daughter. The day of his execution, Feb. 14, he plucked a 
heart-shaped leaf from a clump of violets outside his jail window and pierced 
it with a note for the girl, signing it "From Your Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the first paper valentine was made in 1415 by Charles, Duke 
of Orleans, while he was imprisoned in the Tower of London. The card can be 
seen in the British Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest cards were printed in black and white and sometimes painted by 
hand. In the 1800s, Winslow Homer and scores of famous artists moonlighted by 
painting valentines. During the golden age of lacy valentines -- 1840 through 
1860 -- cards were fashioned from delicate sheets of lace paper. Some featured 
exquisite patterns copied from lace tablecloths. A few had 14-karat gold or 
silver painted on their lace edges. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1850s, an American named Esther Howland began making elaborate 
valentines using the fancy lace paper her father imported to the U.S. from 
England. She set up an assembly line of girls who would cut, glue, paint and 
assemble the cards. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Howland's valentines, identified by a red H on the back, remain coveted 
items among collectors. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1900s, card companies were making valentines with intricate dye 
work, embossing and gilding. Many still think of the era's ornate 
Victorian-style floral cards as the epitome of sweet, old-fashioned valentines. 
</P>
<P>
Early valentines were very serious. Young men sent them to ladies to propose 
marriage. Wedding rings figure prominently on many antique valentines. Often, a 
suitor would spend the winter painting a romantic picture on a lacy sheet of 
paper and inscribing it with a verse. 
</P>
<P>
"He made the whole thing by hand and slipped it under her door in hopes she 
would say yes," says Evalene Pulati, president of the National Valentines 
Collectors Assn. in Santa Ana. "You didn't spend all winter working on a 
valentine for just anybody." 
</P>
<P>
She has a valentine from 1855 that a young man had decorated with two roses -- 
a red rose for love and a white rose for marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I have three from him. It took him about three years to get her," she says. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, men were less afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
"Oft as thy memory has traced each happy hour I've passed with thee, whate'er 
the time or where'er the place, oh think of me!" begs the suitor. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the shrewd marketing strategies of card companies, valentines are no 
longer sent just by men. In 1990, one can find valentines for live-in lovers, 
mothers and stepfathers, fathers and stepmothers, grandparents -- even 
mother-in-laws. As a result, Valentine's Day has become the second-largest 
holiday for exchanging cards, after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Valentines used to be exchanged between schoolchildren and lovers," Pulati 
says. "Now they're trying to capture every market." 
</P>
<P>
The caliber of today's acerbic cards has some people worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked into a Hallmark store to look at valentines, and I was astounded," 
says Dr. David Juroe, psychotherapist with the Yorba Park Medical Clinic in 
Orange. "There were very few cards that expressed deep sentiments." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of deep emotion, he found cards brimming with low-brow humor. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this may have to do with living in a day and age where people are 
much looser in regards to commitments and relationships," Juroe says. 
</P>
<P>
Too many have been exposed to divorce, the dark side of romance. Humorous cards 
reflect modern singles' fear of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real fear of intimacy," he says. "People don't want to express their 
true feelings," so they resort to humor. 
</P>
<P>
Many valentines have become downright crass. Jokes about kinky sex, PMS and 
dieting abound. 
</P>
<P>
A card aimed at women reads: 
</P>
<P>
"To my husband on Valentine's Day. I think you're the most handsome, sexy man 
in the entire world. And I'm not just saying that so you'll give me flowers. . 
. . I'd also like to go out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
There's a proliferation of lewd valentines, the kind that might be exchanged 
between members of the Bundy family on "Married, With Children." 
</P>
<P>
"For Valentine's Day, you know what you'd really look great in?" asks a woman 
on a card. "My bed." 
</P>
<P>
"People are seen not as people but as objects," Juroe says. "It's alarming. 
They don't trust anyone. Maybe it comes from growing up in a dysfunctional 
family. They may think they'll never be hurt or disappointed by acting aloof. 
They become emotionally cut off from others." 
</P>
<P>
Devoid of feeling, men and women start seeing each other as objects from which 
to extract sex or money. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we saying the only way we know how to express love is through sex? How 
sad," Coombs says. "Love is more than sex. Maybe we have a whole segment of the 
population who does not know how to be tender." 
</P>
<P>
One card pointed to the direction valentines might be heading in the 1990s: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like how Valentine's Day has been turned into a pagan-filled 
celebration filled with winged cherubs, overpriced chocolate and uninhibited 
sex," it read. "The winged cherubs have got to go."

JOSEPH N. BELL: DORNAN SHOWS ONLY HIMSELF IN PORTRAYAL OF PRO-CHOICE MALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since I'm deeply into self-awareness, I find it instructive and sometimes 
helpful to weigh what other people think of me. That's why I'm especially 
grateful to our soft-spoken Orange County Congressman Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove). Speaking the other day to an anti-abortion rally in 
Washington, D.C., he described in graphic detail a rather large group of people 
to whom, I fear, I belong. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dornan: "I tend to trivialize the men (in the pro-choice movement). 
They're either women trapped in men's bodies, like Alan Alda and Phil Donahue, 
or younger guys who are like camp followers looking for easy lays. Those males 
don't vote. And when they do, they're starry-eyed liberal Democrats who 
subscribe to Playboy." 
</P>
<P>
Well, now, since -- with a few cavils here and there, something the pro-lifers 
never concern themselves with -- I consider myself pro-choice, I have to accept 
the fact that Rep. Dornan is talking about me. If I were less self-assured, I 
suppose I could get defensive and perhaps a little hostile at this point. 
</P>
<P>
I could say something like: "I tend to avoid playing tennis or attending 
baseball games with the men in the pro-life movement. They're either frightened 
out of their wits by the prospect of a woman taking charge of her own body, or 
they're older guys whose heads have hardened sufficiently that a contrary idea 
or point-of-view couldn't be implanted with a hammer and chisel. They vote for 
single-issue candidates who support their prejudices and tend to subscribe to 
Reader's Digest, which they frequently have difficulty in reading." 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, I wouldn't do that because 1) I don't need to, and 2) I don't 
believe it. The anti-abortion people have a perfectly legitimate point of view 
with which I don't happen to agree. But that doesn't make them bad people, 
except when they act like storm troopers or sound off from what they consider a 
safe seat in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
However, being a pointy-headed liberal who wants eternally to be liked, I took 
Rep. Dornan's words to heart and measured them against what I know of myself to 
see how I could change -- short of switching to the other side -- so Dornan 
would like me better. And I found this exercise troubling because his 
description didn't seem to fit all that well. 
</P>
<P>
Taking it point by point, I'd like to put in a word for Alan Alda. I don't know 
Phil Donahue, but I do know Alda from my Hollywood beat writing days, and if 
Dornan is suggesting that Alda is effeminate, he's wrong, and if I were Alda, 
I'd be a little bit irritated at Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
But I suspect Alda (along with anyone who has ever studied Psychology I) 
recognizes that all men -- to varying degrees -- have women in them, and vice 
versa. We're all a mix of male and female qualities up and down the register, 
and the people who function best in this world are the people who recognize 
that and make the best they can out of both sides of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
And the people who function least well are those who are so frightened at this 
prospect that they compensate by mindless tough talk -- or by applying a 
necktie chokehold on those who don't agree with them, a tactic Dornan has 
apparently found to be persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
Now since, along with Donahue and Alda, I don't qualify as a "younger guy," 
then I don't have to ask if I'm a "camp follower looking for an easy lay." Two 
implications here bother me a little: first that Donahue and Alda and I are no 
longer interested in or of interest to the opposite sex, and, second, that the 
pro-choice women are ready to jump into bed instantly with any "younger" men 
who show support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think either assumption holds up very well. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of specific knowledge in the cases of Donahue and Alda and modesty on my 
part prevent me from exploring the first any further -- although I strongly 
challenge it. 
</P>
<P>
As for the second, Dornan offered no evidence of promiscuity on the part of 
pro-choice women, and my own observations and a quick survey I made of a 
half-dozen such women resulted in indignant denials followed by a high degree 
of hostility toward Dornan and some anatomical suggestions that he might find 
awkward. 
</P>
<P>
As for "those males" not voting, again Dornan offered no evidence to support 
his thesis. I haven't missed voting -- including elections on bond issues, 
vacuous referendums and obscure public officials -- for more decades than I 
care to remember. I will admit that I frequently, but not always, have voted 
for the more liberal candidate of position (which is sometimes hard to figure 
out in Orange County). Whether I was "starry-eyed" is doubtful since in about 
78% of the cases, I found nothing attractive about either candidate and was 
reduced to voting for the one least objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, I have never subscribed to Playboy, although I have read their 
front-of-the-book interviews as often as possible ever since President Jimmy 
Carter admitted in that space that he had been known to "lust" after women, an 
admission that might have made things easier for Richard Nixon a few years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Under close analysis, what all this seems to add up to is not very much. I was 
hoping it might tell me some helpful things about myself, but it would appear 
that the only person it really tells us very much about is Rep. Dornan. 
</P>
<P>
I hope his constituents are listening -- and that Alan Alda has a chance to get 
him by the necktie some day.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: PERFECTIONIST MONSTERS CAN SPOIL LIVES, ANALYST SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a clinical psychologist for the past 14 years, Steven J. Hendlin has seen 
countless self-help books come on the market -- popular books which, in his 
opinion, were overly simplified and promised far more than they could possibly 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach psychologist, who is in private practice in Irvine, had 
book-writing ambitions of his own. But, he felt, most publishers seemed to be 
interested only in self-help books that were poorly written and treated readers 
like 12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of what he now labels a "perfectionist tendency," Hendlin, who has 
written several dozen articles for professional journals, simply chose not to 
write a book at all. 
</P>
<P>
"My own perfectionist tendency made me want to have a book that would be a 
quality, high-level self-help book, and I was concerned with having it lumped 
in with the other books," he said. "So it was easy for me to put it off and 
continue to write professional articles." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Hendlin writes in his chapter on "the Plague of Perfectionism" in his 
recently published book, "The Discriminating Mind," that is "just one more 
example of how the Perfectionist Monster can rise out of the murk and mire to 
bite us on the ass . . . nothing very different from what we go through all the 
time in postponing tackling a project because we don't want to try if it can't 
be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Better, he thought, "to keep the book in the realm of Mental Perfection than 
bring it out into the cold, cruel, rejection-ridden world of publishers, 
editors and the greater public." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until he allowed it "to be OK to write 'just another popular 
psychology book' that didn't have to be perfect that I could go ahead and begin 
the project. I also needed to be willing to face the possible rejection of 
publishers who might not think my writing worthy of publication." 
</P>
<P>
The point, according to Hendlin, "is to use your discriminating mind to know 
when 'good enough is good enough' even if it isn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"Let go of whatever inflated ego feelings go with the need to perform perfectly 
and allow for your feelings of self-worth to stay in place even if you don't 
measure up to someone else who may do the same activity better than you." 
</P>
<P>
Published in England in October and now available in this country, "The 
Discriminating Mind: A Guide to Deepening Insight and Clarifying Outlook" 
(Unwin Hyman; $14.95), is aimed at professional mental health professionals and 
the lay public "who are interested in knowing themselves and the workings of 
their minds at deeper levels." 
</P>
<P>
Hendlin, 41, who has been studying Eastern philosophies and different forms of 
meditative practices for 20 years, has combined ideas from Western psychology 
and psychotherapy with Eastern spiritual concepts which, he says, can help us 
understand ourselves better. 
</P>
<P>
The book, which includes case histories from Hendlin's practice and offers 
practical exercises to guide readers to a greater familiarity with their 
thought processes, examines anger, fear, greed, envy and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
And what exactly is a "discriminating mind"? 
</P>
<P>
According to Hendlin, it is a mind that "combines high-level, rational 
discrimination with intuition and emotional balance." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, he said, is that a discriminating mind is something we all develop as 
we grow into adulthood -- yet "it is something we never develop to the highest 
degree." 
</P>
<P>
"I suggest one reason is we have so many conflicting 'inner voices' that it's 
very hard to get past this inner chatter to hear clearly what our individual 
voices are speaking for. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the themes of the book is we're always having to deal with this 
chattering mind and we don't really learn the skills of how to separate those 
voices -- to be able to hear what our needs are so, instead of being in 
conflict, the different voices are working harmoniously for the whole self." 
</P>
<P>
One powerful method for hearing those voices, Hendlin said, is a meditation 
that helps more clearly distinguish the individual voices and the subtle 
emotions that are associated with them. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I'd hope people get out of the book is to re-evaluate the importance 
of their own inner psychological world -- to realize that there is an amazing 
universe within and to begin to have respect for the methods with which one can 
work on oneself to learn about that inner world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Another main theme is how easy it is for us to delude ourselves as to our true 
motivations for doing things. We underestimate the power of our unconscious 
mind in our daily world. It is crucial for us to understand how much of our 
behavior is unconsciously motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Hendlin maintains that "much of our attention is aimed at the fascinating glitz 
and glitter of the outer world and we've become lopsided and disrespectful of 
really knowing our own minds and the power of the world within. We tend to not
