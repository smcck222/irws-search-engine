SENATORS HEAR GATES ASSAIL ASSAULT RIFLES

Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, urging Congress to ban the sale of 
semiautomatic assault weapons like the AK-47, Friday stormed Capitol Hill with 
an arsenal of tough talk, spraying his critics with blunt warnings about the 
dangers of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
During sometimes fiery testimony before a Senate panel considering a ban on 
such firearms, Gates, a staunch conservative, scolded Congress for not getting 
tough on the issue. He also clashed with a Republican senator who had 
reservations about the proposal and congratulated two liberals who favored it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is uncomfortable for me, because I'm differing with a lot of my friends 
in the National Rifle Assn.," Gates said. "But these weapons have got to go. 
Policemen all over America are united on this. It's time for some action." 
</P>
<P>
In blunt comments that appeared to stun some onlookers, Gates warned the Senate 
Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution that without new restrictions on the 
guns available to gangs and drug dealers, the LAPD might have to arm itself 
with semiautomatic or automatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Domestic Arms Race' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a domestic arms race in this country right now," Gates said. "Do you 
want us to be like Colombia where everybody has automatic weapons? Everybody 
gets shot down there." 
</P>
<P>
The chief also chided Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), a former Philadelphia 
district attorney, for suggesting that it would be easier to cut violent crime 
with tougher sentencing laws and more restrictions on plea bargaining than with 
gun control. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could get together on this, senator," Gates said. "I've heard some 
of the same things from members of the NRA and from some of the hate mail I've 
been getting in recent weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's hearing focused on legislation by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) that 
would ban the sale and importation of new semiautomatic weapons. Under the 
bill, existing assault weapons, which some gun-control groups estimate may 
number 500,000, would be subject to the same strict regulations that now cover 
machine guns. Machine gun purchasers must undergo a rigorous background check 
for arrests or convictions, and law enforcement authorities must certify that 
the weapon is not being purchased for illegal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, those wishing to buy semiautomatic weapons are simply required to 
present identification and fill out a form saying they are not a convicted 
felon, illegal alien or person with a background of mental instability. Federal 
law does not require a background check for prospective buyers, and only three 
states have waiting periods for persons wishing to buy assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who presided over the hearing, said it was prompted 
in large part by the shooting spree last month at a Stockton elementary school 
that killed five students and wounded 29 others. The gunman, Patrick Edward 
Purdy, used an AK-47 in the attack before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
"These weapons are designed for one purpose and one purpose only -- to kill as 
many human beings as possible," Simon said. "I have never seen a hunter with an 
AK-47. The whole point of this is to protect innocent people. This kind of bill 
is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Gates praised Simon and Metzenbaum for their efforts. But gun lobbyists 
complained that the bill is too broad and would prevent legitimate sportsmen 
and hunters from using semiautomatic weapons. They suggested that Congress 
instead pass tougher sentencing laws so people with lengthy criminal records 
would spend more time in jail and less on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunting is not the issue," said Neal Knox of the Firearms Coalition. "I resent 
anyone telling me what I need, as much as I resent anyone telling me what I may 
read. I am a law-abiding citizen who resents being treated as a criminal 
because I own and lawfully use firearms." 
</P>
<P>
The committee also heard from Lori Mackey, a teacher at Cleveland Elementary 
School in Stockton, the scene of the Jan. 17 shooting. In a steady voice, she 
described the horror of the attack and discussed the psychological trauma 
suffered by the young survivors. 
</P>
<P>
"Why aren't there laws to protect us from this madness?" she asked. "Does it 
always have to take a tragedy of this magnitude to get any action? Has there 
been enough suffering to warrant action now?" 
</P>
<P>
When the hearing was over, Gates lashed out at several Republicans in the 
California Assembly who he said were attacking him personally and were also 
trying to block state legislation banning the sale of such guns. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Gates said he was referring to Assemblyman Tom McClintock 
(R-Thousand Oaks), who has introduced a bill that would ban the sale of 
semiautomatic assault weapons to any person who has ever been convicted of a 
violent crime or drug-related offense.

LONG BUDGET BATTLE LIKELY OVER SPENDING PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
President Bush's new budget plan, by calling on Congress to share the blame in 
choosing where to make politically sensitive program cuts, promises to set off 
a long and difficult battle this year over federal spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Top Administration officials, going on the offensive a day after Bush outlined 
his budget plans, on Friday urged the Democrats who control Congress to join 
the White House in behind-the-scenes negotiations to decide which programs 
should be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize Congress may try and suggest it can't be done," White House Chief of 
Staff John H. Sununu said on a television interview program. "But I think we 
are ready to sit down, negotiate and work with whatever slight differences they 
might have on the budget." 
</P>
<P>
The differences, however, will not be slight. The Bush Administration is 
putting much of the budget-cutting onus on Congress by proposing a "flexible 
freeze" that would require lawmakers to pare roughly 7.2% from a variety of 
government programs that total $136 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Just to counteract the effect of inflation on those programs, lawmakers would 
need to find $9.8 billion in cuts, said Richard G. Darman, director of the 
White House's Office of Management and Budget. Those reductions would come on 
top of the $11.8 billion in specific savings that Bush proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a flexible freeze -- it's a flexible squeeze," said Rep. Leon E. 
Panetta (D-Monterey), chairman of the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) accused the White House 
of ducking hard questions by not identifying which programs it believes should 
be cut to provide the money for Bush's new domestic offerings. 
</P>
<P>
He also charged Bush with misleading the public about his "kinder and gentler" 
agenda for the government because some of his initiatives do not, according to 
the White House budget, have any new money behind them. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser pointed out that Bush, who wants to be known as the "education 
President," submitted a budget plan that "calls for spending $100 million less 
(on the Education Department) than the Reagan budget." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a thousand points of light," Sasser charged, "without the batteries." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush document, Sasser added, should be considered an "opening gambit" in a 
long series of discussions between the Administration and Capitol Hill on how 
to reduce the federal deficit and where available money should go. The 
Democratic budget leaders, seeking more specific information from the 
Administration before beginning serious negotiations, invited Darman for 
private talks Monday on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican member of the 
Senate Budget Committee, defended Bush's budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this is a good approach. There's more room for negotiation this 
way," Domenici said. But he distanced himself from some of Bush's proposals, 
questioning the demand to pare $5 billion from projected Medicare spending as 
well as Bush's planned one-year freeze on pensions of retired federal workers. 
"It won't be a cakewalk or a joy ride," Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
Darman stepped up his earlier warning to lawmakers that Bush is willing, if 
necessary, to accept the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law's automatic, 
across-the-board spending cuts rather than accede to a tax increase to bring 
the deficit down. "Yes, unequivocally," he replied to a reporter's question on 
the issue. "We should be prepared to take (the automatic cuts to reach a 
$100-billion deficit target) because that's the law." 
</P>
<P>
Darman also defended abandonment by the White House of the basic approach to 
the budget used over the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the White House first proposed specific reductions or increases in 
programs from a level known as "current services." This is the amount of money 
that would be required to keep a program running in the same fashion. This 
usually assumed an adjustment for inflation and, in certain cases, for 
accommodating an increase in the number of people eligible for a program, such 
as Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standard of Year Before 
</P>
<P>
Bush no longer will use that level as the starting point of the budget process. 
Rather, the White House plans to assume that most programs will be funded at 
exactly the same amount of money they received the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, under Bush's accounting language, keeping a domestic program even with 
inflation is an "increase" and failing to do so is not necessarily a "cut." 
</P>
<P>
"The system we've been using the past eight years doesn't work," Darman said. 
Lawmakers should first agree to cap at $136 billion the wide array of spending 
programs Bush left out of his specific budget recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the White House and Congress can "talk about which ones are we 
going to raise, which ones are we going to lower?" within that overall limit. 
"If we use the current services habit of mind," Darman said, "we won't solve 
this problem." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bush did not seem to apply this same principle to military spending. 
In his speech Thursday night, he took credit for imposing a "one-year freeze in 
the military budget," but his proposal actually allows Pentagon spending to 
rise with inflation that year. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, while the fine print in Bush's budget documents do make the 
necessary distinction, the White House is trying to define on its own terms 
what it means for a federal program to be cut or increased. 
</P>
<P>
"The budget claims to 'freeze' defense while 'increasing' education," stated a 
report prepared Friday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal 
watchdog group. "In fact, defense would get a full inflation adjustment, while 
education would not." 
</P>
<P>
The center also pointed out that Bush claimed to be expanding the Medicaid 
program to include more pregnant women and children. But because his plan does 
not allow any additional federal money to accomplish that goal, "the budget 
effectively proposes to expand Medicaid coverage and make states pay 100% of 
the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Bush "only talked about the good things last night," said Rep. Tony Coehlo 
(D-Merced), the third-ranking Democrat in the House. He "didn't tell us about 
the bad things."

MAJOR TOWER DISCREPANCY FOUND BY PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate panel weighing John Tower's nomination to be defense secretary has 
found a substantial discrepancy in Tower's descriptions of his business 
dealings with a British aircraft and weapons manufacturer, congressional 
sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Tower testified last week that he had represented British Aerospace Inc. only 
on civil aviation matters, not as a consultant on military systems. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a divorce deposition, taken in June, 1987, Tower stated that he had 
given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military 
programs and was paid $8,000 a month. Records show that the payments continued 
from June, 1986, until December, 1988. Also, he served on the board of 
directors of the company, the U.S. subsidiary of British Aerospace PLC. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns About Veracity 
</P>
<P>
The discrepancy, sources said, has prompted concerns about the veracity and 
completeness of Tower's testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
And it raises the question of whether Tower should have registered as a 
lobbyist for foreign interests under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tower's relationships with arms makers are central to reservations expressed by 
some senators about his nomination. Lawmakers from both parties have said they 
are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of 
interest hanging over Tower because of his employment by weapons firms, which 
brought him at least $760,000 in 2 1/2 years -- not including the more than 
$200,000 British Aerospace paid him. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a 
half-dozen U.S. defense firms that do business with the Pentagon. The addition 
of the British firm to the list would add another -- and the first 
foreign-based firm -- whose interests could pose a potential conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that 
Tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Tower aides said they had no comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
A lengthy FBI investigation into Tower's business dealings and his personal 
behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation. The FBI is 
looking into new charges about Tower's alleged drinking, womanizing and receipt 
of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for 
another 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 
24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military 
electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The allegation was raised by a witness in the FBI's massive Ill Wind probe into 
corruption in Pentagon weapons-buying. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that 
his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants 
employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central 
figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation. 
</P>
<P>
A Unisys spokesman said Friday that the company was conducting an internal 
inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current 
corporate employees. 
</P>
<P>
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and other committee members 
are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote 
against Tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The sworn deposition about Tower's business dealings was never filed in court 
because Tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife, Lilla Burt 
Cummings. But the document was obtained by the FBI as part of its background 
investigation of the nominee and is included in the committee's file on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tower's Testimony 
</P>
<P>
Tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed 
only by the American unit of British Aerospace and that he worked chiefly on 
selling the company's commercial jets to U.S. airlines. He said also that he 
advised the firm on U.S. trade legislation and gave opinions on currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
Tower told the committee that he could "recall no actions in connection with 
any defense activities" and did not include his income from British Aerospace 
among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In the divorce papers, however, Tower said that he went to work for British 
Aerospace Inc. on June 1, 1986, eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator 
in the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms reductions talks in Geneva. Around the same 
time, he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense 
firms, including Rockwell International Inc., Textron Inc., LTV Corp. and 
Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In the deposition, Tower said that Rockwell paid him $120,000 a year but said 
he was "underutilized" by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
He said he advised British Aerospace on its chances of selling its training 
jets, fighter planes and missile systems to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deposition Cites Weapons 
</P>
<P>
Among the British Aerospace products Tower tried to sell to U.S. military 
officials were the Tornado fighter, the Hawk trainer, the Rapier anti-aircraft 
missile and the Seawolf short-range air defense missile for ships, according to 
the deposition. 
</P>
<P>
He said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was 
"plugged in in this town" and "knows the defense business pretty well." He said 
that his contacts throughout government made him "marketable." 
</P>
<P>
The complex Foreign Agents Registration Act requires individuals working for or 
representing foreign entities in the United States to register with the Justice 
Department. No registration by Tower is on file, officials said. In related 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vice President Dan Quayle, talking to reporters on a flight to Florida, 
said that he had known Tower for eight years and "I have never seen him 
inebriated. I have never seen drinking be a factor in John Tower's life, other 
than a social glass of wine. . . . Those of us who know him, worked with him, 
can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem, it did not affect him 
when he was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry, he replied: "You 
have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense. Whether he will 
be a capable secretary of defense and do the job of being secretary of defense. 
Let's focus on the qualifications." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tower's doctor said Friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the 
former Texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism. Dr. R. D. 
Dignan, who performed surgery to remove a polyp from Tower's colon on Jan. 5, 
said that after the operation he advised Tower to limit his drinking to one or 
two glasses of wine with dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A longtime Bush political adviser said that Bush "knew what he was doing" 
when he named Tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination, despite 
the controversy. As for Tower, this adviser said: "He's one tough little s.o.b. 
and he's not going to back off."

BUSH PLEDGES ACTION TOWARD ACID RAIN PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
OTTAWA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, traveling to Canada for his first foreign visit since the 
inauguration, pledged Friday to negotiate a treaty limiting the emissions that 
cause acid rain, but he declined to set a timetable or specify the size of the 
reductions he has in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush's pledge remained vague, Canadian officials accepted it as a 
major step toward an agreement on acid rain that they have been seeking with 
the United States since 1979. The Reagan Administration's insistence on the 
need for further study before any action could be taken blocked discussions on 
such an accord for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so long ago that Canada was going it alone" on acid rain, an 
obviously pleased Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in a joint press 
conference after the two leaders met. Bush's statements, he said, "represent 
quite substantial progress." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contrast in Rhetoric 
</P>
<P>
While Bush has taken no action yet on the acid rain issue, his rhetoric has 
been enough of a contrast with Reagan's to guarantee him a friendly reception 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a temperature of 13 below zero when Bush arrived in mid-morning, small 
groups of people stood along the motorcade route to wave greetings, in contrast 
to the demonstrations that met Reagan on his last visit here. 
</P>
<P>
After an airport greeting complete with red carpet and an honor guard of 
red-coated Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Bush and a covey of top aides held 
two hours of meetings with Mulroney and his Cabinet in the government's 
official guest house, followed by a "working lunch" across the street at the 
prime minister's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Bush told reporters the visit "symbolizes the importance that we 
place on the relationship with Canada." 
</P>
<P>
Acid rain, he said, "has been a problem" in U.S.-Canadian relations -- one 
which he is "determined to move towards solution." 
</P>
<P>
Solving the problem, however, will require difficult political choices at home, 
as Secretary of State James A. Baker III conceded when he briefed reporters on 
the Bush-Mulroney talks and his own meetings with Canadian Foreign Minister Joe 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a difficult . . . political situation," Baker said, in 
determining "who's going to pay the price" for reducing the pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of acid rain clean-up, which is expected to be several billion 
dollars, "affects different regions of the United States in different ways," 
Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadians have asked the United States to reduce by more than half the 
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, the two main pollutants that 
form acids when combined with water in the atmosphere. Such reductions, which 
would involve increased use of smokestack "scrubbers" and other 
pollution-control devices, would be particularly costly to the Midwest, where 
coal-burning power plants and industrial burners emit large amounts of the 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Prevailing winds carry pollutants from Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and neighboring 
states east and north to New York, New England and Canada, where acidic rain 
and snowfalls have been widely blamed for damaging forests and poisoning lakes. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian officials estimate that U.S. emissions account for roughly 70% of 
their acid rain problems. And in the United States, emissions of sulfur and 
nitrogen oxides have been on the rise. Nitrogen oxides, in particular, have 
been increasing because they are a prime component of automobile exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
Progress in Congress on acid rain reduction has been stalled for several years 
because of opposition from Reagan Administration officials, the coal and 
utility industries and members of Congress from the Middle West. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said that he had talked with Clark about Central America and that 
Bush had spoken with Mulroney about that region, telling him that the 
Administration hopes the Western Hemisphere's nations can "all adopt . . . a 
policy that represented a diplomatic approach to the issue." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he implied that Clark had mentioned the possibility of Canada's 
participation in a proposed U.N. force to monitor the Central American peace 
process, if such a force is eventually raised. 
</P>
<P>
Baker seemed cool to the idea of a U.N. force. The United States would be 
concerned about any U.N. accord that would weaken pressure on the Nicaraguan 
government to improve human rights conditions domestically, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not substitute . . . any lesser standard" for the goals that have 
been agreed on by previous meetings of Central American presidents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Mulroney, who share a generally conservative ideology, clearly 
appeared to enjoy their meeting. Mulroney won a second term as prime minister 
shortly after Bush's victory last November in an election that turned into a 
referendum on the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement that both men support. 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders joked together during their joint press conference on the lawn 
of the prime minister's residence. At the end, Mulroney, speaking in both 
French and English, asked for a final question. Bush, picking up the cue, 
responded: "Mais oui, fine pour moi, it's colder than hell."

NORTH TRIAL SECRETS CURBS TWICE REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE DEPT. TO SEEK SUPREME COURT ORDER AFTER BEING REBUFFED

<P>
For the second time in two days, a panel of appellate court judges on Friday 
rebuffed efforts by the Justice Department to delay the trial of former White 
House aide Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers, however, will try to get an unusual weekend order from 
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to postpone the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said that Justice Department attorneys will file 
legal papers today asking Rehnquist to grant a stay in North's trial, which is 
scheduled to resume Monday, until the Supreme Court can review the department's 
arguments that tighter restrictions need to be imposed to prevent state secrets 
from being revealed in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh complained in a statement that U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell 
"unfortunately . . . has chosen not to follow the provisions" of the 1980 
Classified Information Procedures Act governing the handling of sensitive 
evidence at a trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Procedures of His Own' 
</P>
<P>
"Instead," said Thornburgh, "he has adopted procedures of his own which do not 
provide the needed assurances of protection to sensitive matters." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell has established broad categories for what may and may not be revealed in 
court but, out of concern for North's right to a fair trial, has shied away 
from allowing government security experts to screen every piece of evidence 
North wants to introduce. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh issued his statement after Justice Department officials had renewed 
their efforts in the U.S. Court of Appeals to stop resumption of the trial, 
contending in new papers that North's attorneys may reveal national security 
secrets in their opening statements to the jury Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials have not suggested what items they are referring 
to, but North has indicated he wants to apprise jurors of other foreign covert 
operations besides the Iran-Contra events in which he participated and which 
had presidential authorization. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell completed selecting a jury of nine women and three men Thursday but 
postponed swearing them in until all legal problems could be resolved. He told 
them to return Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys have argued in their two days of filings that 
Gesell must be ordered to screen in advance the disclosures of defense 
attorneys based on advice from government security analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate judges reiterated Friday that Thornburgh has no standing to try 
to alter Gesell's guidelines for use of the documents, but they noted that the 
attorney general has authority to withhold specific top-secret documents or 
other sensitive evidence if he deems that its disclosure would harm national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Such an extreme action could abort North's trial altogether. 
</P>
<P>
The judges agreed with contentions by Gesell and by independent counsel 
Lawrence E. Walsh that Thornburgh could not intervene in trial procedures 
because Walsh, and not the Justice Department, is in charge of prosecuting 
North under provisions of the Ethics in Government Act. That act sets up a 
court-appointed special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute present or 
former high government officials. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest filing, the Justice Department was critical of Walsh, who has 
publicly split with the department by endorsing guidelines established by 
Gesell. Walsh has declared that political appointees in the department have no 
right to intervene in his prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
The department charged in its brief that part of the current problem results 
from Walsh's "reluctance to insist that statutory requirements (of the 1980 
Classified Information Procedures Act) are followed and his apparent 
indifference to the national security consequences of the course now being 
pursued." 
</P>
<P>
Last month Thornburgh, who heads an inter-agency committee of security 
analysts, determined that sensitive government documents needed for North's 
trial on conspiracy and theft charges in the Iran-Contra scandal could not be 
provided without compromising U.S. secrets. As a result, Walsh and Gesell 
decided that those principal charges must be dismissed from the case, leaving 
North to stand trial on 12 lesser counts, including alleged destruction of 
documents and alleged false statements to Congress and a presidential board of 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
The latest government brief, signed by Assistant Atty. Gen. Edward S. G. Dennis 
Jr., who heads the department's criminal division, said it is urgent that 
North's trial be prevented from resuming until a higher court can weigh the 
department's arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless this court grants the government's motion for a stay, it is likely that 
on that date (Monday) highly sensitive items of classified information will be 
revealed by the defense in its opening statement, causing irreparable damage to 
both the national security and foreign affairs interests of the United States."

SIX OFFICERS SELECTED AS JURORS IN COURT-MARTIAL OF NAVY CAPTAIN

Six Navy captains, four of them from San Diego, were chosen Friday to sit as a 
jury in the court-martial of Capt. Alexander G. Balian, who is charged with 
dereliction of duty for failing to rescue Vietnamese refugees adrift last June 
in the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The six officers were chosen from a panel of eight after four hours of 
questioning. They were asked repeatedly by Balian's lawyer if they believe that 
commanding officers should be held accountable for the actions of their crews. 
</P>
<P>
Balian has said that crewmen of his ship, the amphibious transport Dubuque, 
gave him incorrect information about the condition of the refugees in the 
course of an encounter with their vessel. Balian gave the refugees food, water, 
maps and directions to the nearest land, but decided not to take them on board 
his ship. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees, who had been at sea for 18 days, drifted for another 19 days 
after the June 9 encounter with Balian's ship. Some said they resorted to 
cannibalism in order to survive. Of the 110 who left Vietnam on the junk, 52 
survived, rescued by Philippine fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
The captains selected for the court-martial said they believe strongly in the 
accountability of commanding officers but conceded there could be exceptions. 
All six said they felt that at times they had been unfairly second-guessed by 
superior officers. Several said they had rescued Vietnamese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Balian's lawyer, Dan Donato of San Diego, used his only peremptory challenge to 
excuse Capt. Michael E. Fitzgerald, commander of a logistics group in San 
Francisco, after lengthy questioning about his views on accountability. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgerald said at one point, "All the fiber of my career says the commanding 
officer is responsible for things in his command." 
</P>
<P>
The judge, Capt. James A. Freyer, turned down a defense request that Fitzgerald 
be dismissed for cause. Donato argued that Fitzgerald had already made up his 
mind about the case and could not give Balian a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly he felt the commanding officer is responsible for everything, no 
matter what," Donato said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy prosecutors used their peremptory challenge to excuse Capt. Larry J. 
Andrews, commander of a minesweeping unit in Seattle. Andrews said under 
questioning that he had heard from other commanding officers that the Dubuque 
was "particularly responsive to their needs." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Raymond H. Carlson, the chief prosecutor, offered no reason for the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Under court-martial procedure, prosecution and defense are both permitted just 
one peremptory challenge, which can be used to dismiss any potential member of 
the court without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
In Navy courts-martial, jurors are chosen from among military personnel with 
the same rank or higher than that of the defendant. The jury hears evidence and 
then makes a finding. If a guilty verdict is reached, the jury then issues a 
sentence of punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The judge rules on matters of military law during the trial and ensures that 
all court-martial procedures are carried out properly. 
</P>
<P>
The six officers selected are Capts. Robert L. Klein, of a surface ship 
readiness support group in San Diego; Lawrence B. Blumberg, commander of a 
destroyer squadron in San Diego; Carl A. Weegar, commander of a naval beach 
group in San Diego; Howard S. Stoddard, commander of an amphibious squadron in 
San Diego; William C. Fox, commander of fleet activities in Korea, and Ronald 
F. Walters, commander of a sealift command in Yokohama. 
</P>
<P>
They will begin hearing testimony Monday from about 30 witnesses who are 
expected to be called.

President Bush has decided to keep giving military aid to the Afghan rebels as 
long as the Soviets continue to support the Kabul government of President 
Najibullah, an Administration official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush considered the issue at a National Security Council meeting early Friday 
before he left for Ottawa to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy in Afghanistan remains one of positive symmetry," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States said last spring when the Soviet troop withdrawal accord was 
signed in Geneva that Washington would continue to supply the rebels as long as 
the Soviets supply the Kabul government.

JAPAN PLANS MODERATE RISE IN MILITARY SPENDING 
</P>

<P>
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told Parliament on Friday that Japan will 
formulate a new five-year defense plan beginning in 1991 that will call for a 
moderate increase in military spending despite "a new current" in international 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Takeshita had clarified Japan's intention to 
continue expanding defense spending after the present build-up ends. 
</P>
<P>
He provided no specific figures, but he said the new plan will call for a 
moderate build-up similar to that approved for the 1986-1990 program. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has earmarked 18.4 trillion yen ($147.2 billion) for defense in the 
present five-year period, a 12% increase over the previous plan. The fiscal 
1989 budget Takeshita has submitted to Parliament calls for 3.92 trillion yen 
($31.4 billion) for defense, a one-year increase of 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita said the new diplomatic stance by the Soviet Union, the expanding 
dialogue between Washington and Moscow, and movement toward normalization of 
Sino-Soviet relations have produced "a new current in the international 
situation," but he warned that "it would not do to be overly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing promises he made to President Bush during their meeting in Washington 
on Feb. 2, Takeshita said Japan plans to carry out "an activist foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
"Japan has greater responsibilities than ever before," he said, "not only in 
the economic field but across the entire spectrum of the international 
community." 
</P>
<P>
But he reaffirmed that Japan will not become a military giant. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a tour of Southeast Asian nations that Takeshita is reportedly 
planning for April and May, he indicated that he is thinking of traveling to 
regions seldom visited by Japanese leaders. He mentioned Latin America, the 
Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Africa as regions where he wants to 
"vigorously promote personal contacts" with national leaders "to broaden the 
geographical diversity of Japanese diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
He refrained, however, from making any suggestion that Japan is assuming 
leadership. He said "Japan's basic stance is that of striving for coordination 
with Western countries." With Japan-U.S. relations as "the cornerstone of 
Japanese foreign policy," he and Bush "reaffirmed that we will further promote 
policy coordination and joint undertakings," Takeshita added. 
</P>
<P>
The most specific diplomatic actions promised by Takeshita and Foreign Minister 
Sosuke Uno, in a separate speech, were increased aid to Afghan refugees, 
support for a U.N. observer team that will oversee the transition of Namibia to 
independence this year, and cooperation "within an international framework" to 
establish an independent, neutral Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita acknowledged that he faces political problems at home. He said a 
stock-trading scandal that has plagued his government since last summer has 
"broadened distrust of politics." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an extremely serious situation for Japan's parliamentary democracy," 
he said. "I must honestly accept harsh criticism, join hands with you and 
restore the people's trust in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Political reform, he said, will be his No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita said Japan will continue to restructure its economy to focus on 
growth spurred by domestic demand rather than by exports. He also said Japan 
must open its markets further. 
</P>
<P>
In view of widespread predictions by Japanese economists that the country's 
$90-billion-plus trade surplus will expand further this year, the speech was 
most notable for its once-over-lightly treatment of trade issues.

BAKER TO AIM FOR BETTER RELATIONS IN BONN VISIT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will arrive Sunday in Bonn in an effort 
to do something about what diplomats say is the rockiest period in U.S.-German 
relations since the conservative Helmut Kohl became chancellor in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Secretary Baker would be wise to pour oil on troubled waters," a 
Western diplomat observed. "The waters have certainly been rough lately." 
</P>
<P>
Another diplomat said Baker's visit would be an opportunity for damage-control 
in the all-important Bonn-Washington relations. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will find an undercurrent of anti-U.S. sentiment in the West German news 
media and public opinion, an undercurrent that surfaces only rarely. 
</P>
<P>
He will find a government that has been floundering in domestic and foreign 
issues alike, without firm direction, and a governing coalition that is often 
at odds with itself, incapable of lessening the strains in the Bonn-Washington 
alliance. These strains have become a matter of concern for other members of 
the larger Western Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern Over Sovereignty 
</P>
<P>
The German grievances are sometimes vague -- for example, a feeling that West 
Germany does not have full sovereignty so long as foreign troops from NATO, 
mostly U.S. troops, are based on German soil. 
</P>
<P>
Some West Germans have come to regard the U.S. troops as a kind of occupation 
force, a misapprehension rarely corrected by left-wing elements of the German 
press and politics. 
</P>
<P>
But some complaints are specific, involving massive troop maneuvers that damage 
the environment and low-flying jet fighters that present a noise nuisance and a 
safety problem, when they crash. The United States and other members of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization are dealing with these problems, but 
belatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Many Germans resent what they consider undue U.S. pressure on their government 
-- to modernize short-range nuclear weapons, for instance, and to enact laws 
banning the sale of certain chemicals to foreign customers. 
</P>
<P>
None of this has been helped by what many regard as the ham-handedness of Kohl 
and some of his close advisers. Virtually everyone agrees that Kohl mishandled 
the recent controversy over West German firms that supplied materials to what 
were said to be chemical weapons plants in Iraq and Libya. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grudging Admission 
</P>
<P>
Instead of investigating the charges, which had been made privately to Bonn by 
U.S. intelligence agencies, Kohl attempted to exonerate the firms publicly and 
complained about lack of evidence. Only later did he grudgingly admit that his 
own intelligence service had confirmed much of what the Americans had told him. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Kohl is being blamed for sharpening the fractious argument over 
modernizing short-range nuclear weapons, those with a range of under 300 miles. 
NATO decided to modernize as far back as 1983, yet Kohl has since allowed the 
issue to be dragged back into the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
NATO planners charged with upgrading U.S.-made Lance missiles fear that Kohl 
may try to duck the issue until after federal elections in December, 1990. 
Their fears appeared to come true Friday with a report in the Financial Times 
of London quoting Kohl as saying a decision on whether to modernize such 
missiles should be put off until 1991 or 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Kohl said in an interview that Lance missiles 
remain "sufficient and intact until 1995 . . . . The real decision over the 
production (of a successor) will be in 1991-1992." 
</P>
<P>
Such a delay would infuriate NATO officials, and Washington needs a firm 
decision in order to plan a successor to the Lance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outflanked by Genscher 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, a Christian Democrat, has allowed Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher, whose Free Democratic Party is part of the governing coalition, to 
outflank him internationally with suggestions that any modernization of the 
missiles be delayed until after an agreement at next month's conventional arms 
talks in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher has been much more supportive of the policies of Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev than most other Western leaders, including former 
President Ronald Reagan and President Bush. Some Americans officials use the 
term "Genscherism" to denote German unreliability in dealings with the East. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy here has been embarrassed by West German public opinion polls 
showing Gorbachev to be vastly more popular than U.S. leaders, and showing that 
West Germans believe there is a greater risk of war caused by the United States 
than by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has often lost sight of how deeply most West Germans, who live on 
the line between East and West, desire better relations with the Soviet Union 
and its satellites, especially East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This was put into words recently by Freimut Duve, a member of Parliament of the 
opposition Social Democratic party. He said: "I am very much a postwar child, 
and I am not anti-American. But I do get angry when people abroad try to tell 
us how to read Gorbachev. They can't judge what East-West disarmament means to 
us on the front line." 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Richard R. Burt has worked hard to nurse the 
Bonn-Washington relationship back to health. He describes recent rifts as part 
of West Germany's coming of age, and reflective of a deeper change in the roles 
of the two allies. 
</P>
<P>
The change, Burt says, means a larger and more assertive international role for 
West Germany, with attendant aches and pains in its relationship with the 
United States.

COURT WON'T HALT ABORTION ON N.Y. WOMAN IN COMA

New York's highest court refused Friday to hear an appeal by two anti-abortion 
activists seeking to block a man from having an abortion performed on his 
comatose and brain-damaged wife. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion opponents immediately filed a motion for a stay with U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, but he turned down their request late Friday. 
Marshall did not comment on his decision, a court spokesman said from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will finally be the end to this nightmare," Martin Klein said 
after the seven judges of the state Court of Appeals, without comment, declined 
to review a lower court's ruling making Klein his wife's guardian. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Klein, 32, is 17 weeks pregnant. She has been in a coma at North Shore 
University Hospital on Long Island since a Dec. 13 car accident. Klein, of 
Upper Brookville, said doctors told him an abortion might save her life. The 
couple have a 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors late Friday began preparing Nancy Klein for the abortion procedure, and 
the abortion opponents, John Short and John Broderick, said their lawyers would 
ask Justice Antonin Scalia to have the full court consider a stay of the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court in Brooklyn, 
calling Short and Broderick "absolute strangers," had ruled Thursday that they 
"have no place in the midst of this family tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Klein's parents support her husband's decision to seek an abortion, 
officials said.

<P>
To the cheers of pennant-waving supporters, Ron Brown won the Democratic 
national chairmanship Friday, becoming the first black to head a major 
political party. 
</P>
<P>
He promptly pledged to bring unity to Democrats and hard times to their 
Republican opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Elected by acclamation, Brown marched to the podium to the strains of "How High 
the Moon" and vowed not to permit his racial identity to overshadow his 
responsibilities as the party's leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The story of my chairmanship won't be about race; it will be about the races 
we win over the next four years," said Brown, 47, a Washington lawyer-lobbyist 
and former campaign aide to Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Significance 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Brown made a point of acknowledging the broader significance of 
his victory. "In choosing the first American of African descent to lead one of 
America's major political parties you have made history," he told the 403 
members of the Democratic National Committee here. "I know some people are 
wondering just what kind of history we've made. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not run for this position on the basis of race, but I will not run away 
from it. I am proud of who I am and I am proud of this party. Diversity is our 
strength, as it is America's strength." 
</P>
<P>
Brown lost no time in attacking the Republicans, deriding President Bush's 
proposals for carrying out his promise of a "kinder and gentler" nation and the 
plans of the new Republican chairman, Lee Atwater, to win the votes of blacks 
and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education, Health Needs 
</P>
<P>
Citing the efforts of various Democratic governors to meet education and health 
needs, Brown said: "For these leaders, 'kinder and gentler' doesn't come from 
some ghostwriter. it comes from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, after a year of questioning our party's patriotism, George Bush is 
promoting all our policies and Lee Atwater is pandering to all our 
constituencies." 
</P>
<P>
Confidently predicting gains for Democrats from the state level up to the White 
House, which they have not won since 1976, Brown urged party leaders to deal 
with two of the party's perceived weak spots -- crime and national security. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to say flat out: There is no one tougher than Democrats when it comes 
to protecting our children from drugs, when it comes to protecting our cities 
against crime and when it comes to protecting our nation against terrorism and 
aggression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When Brown first announced his candidacy last December to succeed outgoing 
Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., many in the party expressed consternation that his 
selection would alienate white middle-class voters, whom the party needs to 
recapture the presidency. Brown's foes said their major objection was not to 
his race but to his liberal background and his ties to the controversial 
Jackson, whom he served as convention manager in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But helped by an efficient campaign organization and the backing of the 
AFL-CIO, a potent influence in the party, Brown overwhelmed his four opponents. 
All of them withdrew before Friday's vote, allowing his supporters to turn the 
election into a unity demonstration, complete with buttons, banners, placards 
and enthusiastic oratory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party is blessed by virtue of his leadership," declared Willie 
Brown, Speaker of the California Assembly, in seconding Brown's nomination. 
Praise also came from Richard Wiener, head of the party state chairmen's 
association, who had been regarded as Brown's most formidable rival for the 
post. He called Brown "a leader, a unifier and a builder of our Democratic 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
Brown will serve a four-year term. His salary is a matter for negotiation with 
the national committee, but Kirk, party officials said, was paid in the same 
range as the $89,500 that goes to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The harmonious mood carried over into the election of other officers. A 
potentially bitter fight between blacks and the forces of organized labor for 
the new post of vice chairman for voter registration was averted when two black 
candidates, Little Rock Mayor Lottie Shackelford and New Orleans Mayor Sidney 
Barthelemy withdrew, allowing the election of Jack Otero, international vice 
president of the Transportation-Communications Union. 
</P>
<P>
In return, party sources said, labor gave its backing to Shackelford in a 
contest for one of the three other vice chairmanships. She was elected along 
with incumbent Lynn Cutler of Iowa and Carmen O. Perez, assistant chief deputy 
to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Farmer, who had been chief fund-raiser for the Michael S. Dukakis 
presidential campaign, was elected treasurer, and Dorothy Bush, who is not 
related to the President, was chosen as party secretary, a post she has held 
since 1944.

<TEXT>
<P>
City officials on Friday evicted the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
from a building where thousands of Central Americans apply for asylum each 
week, accusing the INS of not complying with the fire code and failing to clean 
up litter and human waste around the building. 
</P>
<P>
The fire marshal and police officers cleared the building, then locked the two 
main entrances and sealed a third with duct tape. A notice was put on the 
building saying that it is not safe for habitation. About 100 Central Americans 
and some INS employees stood outside the padlocked building as policemen turned 
away arriving immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The city was later granted a temporary restraining order forbidding the INS to 
reopen the center or any other facility in Harlingen "in such a manner as to 
constitute a nuisance and threat to public health and safety." 
</P>
<P>
On some nights, scores of Central Americans have slept outside the building to 
retain places in line for the next morning. Four portable toilets at the side 
of the building have been allowed to overflow, the lawsuit says, and the 
parking lot and nearby vacant lots are littered with trash and rotting food. 
</P>
<P>
The INS kept a fire exit at the center locked and had seating for 450 people in 
a building that, under the fire code, has a maximum occupancy of 196, the suit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The INS has not performed any health screening of the asylum refugees for 
communicable diseases, the lawsuit charged, and local health officials have 
reported an increase in hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials said they have been working to improve the center. The agency has 
resolved two of the three fire code violations brought to its attention and was 
reducing the seating capacity, INS attorney David Ayala said.

HIGH COURT REFUSES TO GIVE DOG ITS DAY IN 2-YEAR LEGAL STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court received another last-minute request Friday morning to stop 
an execution, but this one differed in an important respect: The plea was made 
on behalf of a dog. 
</P>
<P>
After brief consideration by the justices, the request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
Taz, a Malemute/Akita-type dog that was described as "husky and playful" by its 
Oregon attorney, had already lost rounds before a county board, two state 
courts in Oregon, a federal district judge in Portland and the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the dog's owner file appeals for two years? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Action Called Unfair 
</P>
<P>
"Because he loved his dog," said Kerry Rydberg, a Eugene lawyer who represent 
dog owner Shane Bowlin. "We also think this was unfair and unconstitutional. We 
think the evidence was not very strong, and we were not permitted to 
cross-examine the witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
According to the thick court record, Taz's troubles began on Jan. 23, 1987, 
when he was seized by Deschutes County officials for having "engaged in the 
killing, wounding or injuring of livestock." Specifically, he had been seen by 
a ranch owner "chewing on and biting a llama" along with two other dogs, 
including a pit bull. 
</P>
<P>
After two hearings before the county board, Taz was sentenced to "be killed in 
a humane manner on Feb. 18, 1987." But the county agreed to stay the execution 
while Bowlin appealed. 
</P>
<P>
In his petition to the high court, Bowlin contended that he had been "denied 
fundamental due process of law." The county ordinance under which Taz was 
convicted "violates the 14th Amendment" because it does not require a full 
adversarial hearing. Second, "plaintiffs were not permitted to confront and 
cross-examine the witnesses" who identified Taz as one of the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vicious Attack Cited 
</P>
<P>
County officials say they had ample evidence that all three dogs took part in 
the "vicious" attack. But Rydberg says Taz may have been mistaken for another 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 23 last year, U.S. Judge James M. Burns in Portland turned down the 
constitutional challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal courts used to be viewed as austere, even learned tribunals," Burns 
began. "Not any more. Thanks to the expansion of civil rights jurisprudence, 
this is now a 'doggie court.' Indeed, this case is an animal 'double-header' 
since it involves both dogs and llamas." 
</P>
<P>
But, in a 13-page opinion, Burns carefully considered and rejected the dog 
owner's legal contentions. He even added a footnote assuring dog owners that he 
meant "nothing derogatory" by his comments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stay Denied by Court 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the 9th Circuit Court denied a motion to stay the execution. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year court fight came to an end Friday afternoon. Minutes after the 
emergency petition was denied by Justice Antonin Scalia, Taz was "put to 
sleep," according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was a long shot. But we didn't want to give up without trying," 
Rydberg said.

CUCUMBER, PEPPER QUARANTINE LIFTED

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Agriculture says it has lifted its quarantine of ABC 
Brand cucumbers and red bell peppers after testing shipments throughout the 
state and finding no illegal pesticide levels. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors quarantined the produce after finding high levels of the pesticide 
methamidophos on cucumbers and red bell peppers during a routine inspection at 
Raley's Distribution Center in West Sacramento. The 53-store chain immediately 
removed the vegetables from its stores. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors, however, did not find illegal pesticide levels on produce tested at 
other wholesalers throughout the state, agriculture official Doug Okumura said.

INSURER APPEALS POLICY RENEWAL ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Travelers group of insurance companies Friday asked the California Supreme 
Court to overturn an order issued last week by state Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie requiring it to renew about 22,000 car insurance policies in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that four Travelers subsidiaries are seeking to withdraw from the auto 
insurance business in the state, Travelers Executive Vice President Thomas 
McAboy said the appeal contends that the company "has a basic constitutional 
right to cease doing private passenger automobile business in California," 
regardless of any provisions to the contrary in Proposition 103. During the 
appeal, Travelers has said it will renew all policies.

HOUSE CAREER ENDED BY ELIZABETH RAY SCANDAL; 
</P>

EX-REP. WAYNE L. HAYS OF OHIO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne L. Hays, once one of the most powerful and feared men in the House of 
Representatives but whose affair with his secretary a dozen years ago touched 
off a scandal that destroyed his career, died Friday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
The former Ohio Democrat died in the emergency room of Wheeling Hospital about 
noon PST, apparently of heart failure, nursing supervisor Linda Crook said. The 
Wheeling News Register said Hays had visited a heart specialist in Columbus, 
Ohio, on Thursday for tests. 
</P>
<P>
Hays' wife, Pat, was at his side when he died. 
</P>
<P>
Hays began his political career in 1939, when he was elected mayor of Flushing, 
a town of 1,200 in his native Belmont County in rural eastern Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He was elected to the House in 1948. When he quit under fire on Sept. 1, 1976, 
he was finishing his 14th two-year term in Congress and was chairman of the 
powerful House Administration Committee. He resigned to stop a House Ethics 
Committee investigation into his conduct with secretary Elizabeth Ray. Public 
hearings were to begin 2 1/2 weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Ray had been hired as a secretary but said she actually was paid to serve as 
Hays' mistress. She later admitted that she could not even type. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't type. I can't file. I can't even answer the phone," Ray, 33 at the 
time, told reporters. She had earned $14,000 a year for two years on Hays' 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Hays had remarried just six weeks before the Ray scandal broke. The previous 
year he had divorced his first wife of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's disclosures followed an incident in which Hays ordered Capitol Police to 
escort her out of his office. She said she had gone to his office to ask why 
she had not been invited to Hays' wedding when the rest of the staff had. 
</P>
<P>
Ray met with reporters for the Washington Post later that same day. "It's not 
that I care so much about (Hays) getting married," she said, "but it looks bad 
that I'm not invited. I was good enough to be his mistress for two years, but 
not good enough to be invited to his wedding." 
</P>
<P>
At first Hays denied, then acknowledged in a tearful speech before the House 
that he was having an affair with Ray. But he steadfastly denied her charges 
that she was kept on his payroll only to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
After his resignation, the Ethics Committee voted to end its three-month 
investigation of the scandal on grounds that Hays no longer was a congressman 
and no longer under the panel's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, which also investigated the matter, decided not to 
prosecute. Department attorneys said they lacked evidence corroborating Ray's 
account and her relationship with Hays. 
</P>
<P>
'I think he did it to save his family," Carl Albert, then Speaker of the House, 
told reporters after receiving Hays' resignation letter. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation, Hays said he was leaving Congress "with a heavy 
heart." Hays denounced Ray as a publicity seeker and railed at the Washington 
Post for "harassment." 
</P>
<P>
His physical and emotional health also was a factor. He had been hospitalized 
in June, 1976, after taking an overdose of sleeping pills.

After leaving office, Hays returned to his 300-acre Red Gate Farm in Belmont, 
where he bred Angus cattle and Tennessee walking horses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Hays made a comeback of sorts with his election to the Ohio House. 
There, he pushed bills aimed at curbing big utilities and promoting Ohio coal, 
but generally kept a low profile. One exception came during an incident in 
which he threatened to punch a television cameraman during a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
He was defeated in a reelection bid in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Hays became chairman of the Democratic Party in Belmont County 
and remained active in local party politics.

DOCTORS AT USN HOSPITAL REBEL OVER DEFICIENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In an unusual act of open rebellion, a group of doctors at the Long Beach Naval 
Hospital say they have ceased admitting seriously ill patients because of what 
they say are major and potentially hazardous inadequacies in equipment, 
services and personnel at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The six physicians, from the hospital's internal medicine department, detailed 
their concerns in a recent memo to their commanding officer that was made 
available to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"The internal medicine department has had to confront a steadily decreasing set 
of patient care resources," the doctors said in the memo. "Recently these 
deficiencies have progressed to the point where we feel that patients may be 
endangered." 
</P>
<P>
According to a recent internal audit of services, for instance, the facility 
cannot sufficiently handle the treatment of allergies, heart ailments, 
gynecological problems, childbirth or surgery to the hand, throat or blood 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Frustration 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Frederick L. Jones, head of the department and one of the memo's signers, 
said that the move was the culmination of long-simmering frustrations over the 
deficiencies, some of which were outlined in the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Another staff physician, who did not sign the memo and who spoke only on 
condition that his name not be used, said: "I feel scared that my patients are 
being taken care of in a system where the level of accountability and 
responsibility is very, very low. I think that (because of the lack of medical 
support), any patient I operate on is at higher risk of a negative outcome than 
a similar patient on the outside." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the facility -- the only naval hospital in Los Angeles County and 
one which is considered a full-service general acute-care facility -- deny that 
patients there receive less than adequate care. They also dispute the doctors' 
assertion that admissions have decreased in the last few months and 
characterize the memo simply as a particularly dramatic expression of the 
frustrations that most Navy doctors share. 
</P>
<P>
However, they acknowledge the chronic health care problems that beset most 
military hospitals. The military health care system has been in crisis for 
years. Ever since the end of the Vietnam War, military medical facilities 
throughout the country have been trying to balance the demands of ballooning 
patient loads with a dwindling supply of resources, while struggling to attract 
and retain experienced physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is more keenly aware of the problems facing Navy medicine than Navy 
medicine," said Pat Kelly, a Navy spokeswoman based in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Crisis 
</P>
<P>
But at the Long Beach Naval Hospital, some doctors say, the situation has 
become so acute that patients' lives are being endangered and doctors' spirits 
sorely tested. Many of their complaints are documented in the recent series of 
internal hospital memos. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, according to the Navy, the number of staff physicians at the site 
-- a 114-bed facility serving nearly 300,000 active duty military personnel, 
retirees and dependents -- has dwindled from 68 to 38, a 44% decline that has 
necessitated the curtailment of several major medical services. Although this 
is comparable to the experience of other area naval hospitals, officials say, 
the response has been especially pronounced at Long Beach. Staff morale, 
according to one experienced Navy physician, is at an all-time low -- "the 
worst I've ever seen any place." 
</P>
<P>
The memo dated Nov. 30 that was signed by the six internal medicine doctors 
outlines a number of hospital deficiencies. For example, the memo mentions the 
hospital's "shrunken" radiology department, which offers no in-house weekend 
service; a "poorly stocked pharmacy" lacking such rudimentary medications as 
Tylenol; basic supply shortages, "including alcohol wipes and IV (intravenous) 
solutions"; frequent "unavailability of crucial laboratory tests," and the 
longstanding absence of specialists capable of dealing with anything but 
routine ailments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shared Resources 
</P>
<P>
While doctors acknowledge that naval hospitals throughout the country suffer 
from similar shortages, the hospitals often share resources by trading patients 
in a sort of "mixing and matching" of services. But for patients in Los Angeles 
County, the doctors say, the closest full-service naval hospital outside Long 
Beach is 50 miles to the south at Camp Pendleton, raising the specter of 
wasting valuable time trying to transport seriously ill patients to hospitals 
capable of treating them. 
</P>
<P>
"Because such problems are so significant and widespread," the memo went on to 
say, "we no longer feel medically or ethically capable of caring for patients 
whose illness is not minor. For their own protection we therefore will no 
longer admit patients who may require intensive care to this hospital. 
Regrettably, we can see a time when no medicine patient could be admitted to 
this facility." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials deny that overall admissions have gone down since the memo 
was written, despite the doctors' assertions that they are carrying out their 
pledge. The officials add, however, that they have no way of gauging the 
relative seriousness of the illnesses suffered by those admitted now compared 
to those admitted in the past. 
</P>
<P>
And while acknowledging that major gaps exist in the services they can provide, 
the officials say that they routinely refer patients in need of unavailable 
medical services to better equipped military or civilian facilities, though 
apparently not often enough to satisfy the signers of the memo. 
</P>
<P>
"I would read (the memo) as saying that these doctors were being dramatic in 
trying to confront an issue that they thought was insurmountable when, in fact, 
it wasn't insurmountable had they gone through (proper channels), " Navy 
spokeswoman Kelly said. "Even the existence of this memo shows the concern that 
our providers have for their patients." 
</P>
<P>
While the document was initially treated as a "routine quality assurance memo" 
that raised no red flags, Kelly said, it was scrutinized more closely after 
inquiries by The Times. Since then, she said, a Navy inspector general has 
visited the site and determined that the deficits mentioned in the memo were 
temporary and did not affect patient care. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not the first time questions have been raised regarding the level 
of care offered at the Long Beach Naval Hospital, which was commissioned in 
1967. Three years ago, the hospital closed its emergency room after a Navy 
inspection report concluded that it lacked a department head and was staffed by 
physicians without significant emergency medicine experience. "The (quality 
review and risk-management) program in the emergency room is virtually 
non-existent," Navy inspectors reported in the 58-page document. 
</P>
<P>
The memos obtained by The Times also indicate a pattern of complaints by 
various physicians over the last two years. "Major problems remain: the lack of 
emergency and acute care (as well as) inexperience of the nursing and ancillary 
staff in support of the physicians," noted one department head in a 1987 memo. 
"Morale of the staff remains poor and retention is abysmal." 
</P>
<P>
A year later the same doctor, who is no longer at the hospital, complained in 
writing to his superiors that "the current crisis facing Navy medicine began 
with an arrogance that we could continue to do more with less. Our primary goal 
must be to realize that our resources are diminishing to a critical level and 
to continue to provide quality care some difficult decisions will have to be 
made." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Continue? 
</P>
<P>
Some of those decisions involve the question of how to continue operating 
without being able to offer some services ordinarily associated with a 
full-service acute-care hospital, which is how Navy officials describe the Long 
Beach facility. 
</P>
<P>
According to the hospital's recent internal audit -- a monthly inventory of 
medical services distributed Navywide -- the hospital lacks, among other 
things, a cardiologist, an allergist and an obstetrician/gynecologist. Services 
available only on a limited basis, meanwhile, include internal medicine, 
echo-cardiograms, treatment of ailments having do with the eyes or nervous 
system, the treatment of children and the taking of X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are reacting to the shortages in various ways. 
</P>
<P>
Some agonize over which patients to keep and which to refer elsewhere. Others, 
like the memo signers, say they are sending more and more to civilian 
facilities, even though visits to non-military hospitals by military personnel 
or dependents cost the government about $100 apiece, compared to the average 
$30 cost of visits to the Navy hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Still other physicians, many of whom have been complaining for at least a year 
about the growing necessity of turning away seriously ill patients, choose to 
leave the Navy completely and set up more lucrative private practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I trained for a long time to do a lot of different things and I couldn't do 
them there," said Dr. Richard Furman, echoing widely held sentiments 
constituting what the Navy acknowledges as a major problem. Frustrated by the 
deterioration of his skills through lack of use and concerned about the 
potentially hazardous effects should he ever be required to treat seriously ill 
patients, Furman left the Long Beach Naval Hospital last June to open a private 
practice in Suffolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't take on sick patients," he said. "You lose all your skills and 
I didn't train all this time to lose all my skills."

PAYOLA CHARGES AGAINST RECORD PROMOTER DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM K. KNOEDELSEDER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles on Friday threw out payola charges against a San 
Francisco-area record promoter and dealt at least a temporary setback to the 
Justice Department's much-publicized investigation into alleged illegal 
practices in the recording industry. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to a defense motion, U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer dismissed 
three misdemeanor payola counts against Ralph Tashjian of San Mateo on grounds 
that the grand jury indictment was not specific enough to allow the promoter to 
defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Distributions of Cocaine' 
</P>
<P>
Tashjian had been charged with "making regular undisclosed payments or 
distributions of cocaine to program directors so the records he was promoting 
would be added to radio station play lists," according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the judge's ruling, Tashjian's attorney, Anthony P. Brooklier, 
said: "The problem was, the government charged my client with multiple offenses 
over a long period of time without specifying the dates of those alleged 
offenses or the records involved. The judge ruled that the charges were too 
general and didn't adequately inform the defendant with what he was charged." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor in the case, Richard Stavin, a special attorney for the Los 
Angeles Organized Crime Strike Force, said the government will file a criminal 
information next week charging Tashjian with 200 individual counts of payola. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stavin, the dismissal was due to a "weakness in the payola 
statute," which addresses only specific incidents and "doesn't contemplate a 
scheme or ongoing course of action." 
</P>
<P>
"The judge suggested that Congress may want to revisit the language of the law, 
which we would urge also," Stavin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Evasion Counts 
</P>
<P>
Tashjian is set to stand trial, along with his wife, later this month on 
separate felony tax evasion charges stemming from the payola case. "But the 
crux of the government's case are the payola charges," Brooklier said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tashjians were indicted -- along with another record promoter and a former 
radio station manager -- in February, 1988, after a two-year investigation by 
the Internal Revenue Service under the direction of the Organized Crime Strike 
Force. Charges against the other defendants are pending. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the indictments at a press conference at the time, U.S. Atty. 
Robert C. Bonner called it the most significant payola case in 15 years.

TIME TO WORK OUT THE ANGLES; 
</P>
<P>
38 YEARS LATER, ARCHITECT STILL LABORS OVER HIS 'UNFINISHED SYMPHONY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 38 years, architect George Frank Ligar has been painstakingly building a 
dream house on the slope of a hill in the View Park section of Baldwin Hills. 
He may be finished in, oh, about two years. 
</P>
<P>
Ligar, who in the 1950s briefly won international recognition for his 
geometrically designed houses in the style of organic architecture that was 
pioneered by the late Frank Lloyd Wright, holds what is believed to be the 
longest-running building permit ever in Los Angeles County, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Now 70, Ligar still finds time to periodically work on the house he started in 
1951 and calls his "unfinished symphony." 
</P>
<P>
"Most houses are nothing more than coffins," he said. "You know what a coffin 
is -- it's a box. And that is what most houses look like -- boxes with holes 
for doors to go from room to room and holes for windows to look outside. There 
is no emotion or feeling behind it. I try to create something that has feeling, 
something with character, expression. It's not just so many square feet." 
</P>
<P>
The unfinished house, which is built to resemble an equilateral triangle and 
fashioned out of concrete and stone, is taking so long to build, he said, in 
large part because a mudslide three decades ago buried the project, causing him 
to lose his financing. "I had to start over from scratch," he said in his 
gentlemanly fashion. "I had to finish the house on my own, sort of pay as you 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the neighbors are so enthusiastic about Ligar's visionary house. Over 
the years, some have blamed him for maintaining an unsightly, even hazardous 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Vera Jo Smith, who has lived next to Ligar's property on Presidio Drive since 
1951, wonders why he has been allowed to stall development for so many years. 
"I don't see how he can get a permit to build a house and take 35 years to do 
it," she said. "It's an eyesore and I have complained many times, but nothing 
does any good." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the county lacked the authority to force Ligar to complete the house 
because there was nothing in the law setting time limits for builders. In 1971, 
the law was changed -- largely in response to complaints about Ligar's project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Code Revised 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors revised the building code to make it a misdemeanor if 
a project takes more than five years to complete and if it "detracts from the 
appearance of the neighborhood or reduces the value of property." Ligar's house 
was declared substandard by the county's Building Rehabilitation Board and the 
architect was ordered to complete the structure or demolish it. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tim D. Hansen, a deputy district attorney at the time, declined to 
take the matter to court. In a 1972 letter, Hansen wrote that "I could in no 
way envision Mr. Ligar's project as substandard." He added that he thought the 
property would probably be "extremely valuable when completed." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said recently that he recommended against prosecuting the case because 
he did not believe that it was the intent of the Board of Supervisors to use 
the law to tear down a man's life work. "That would have been a very hard 
decision to make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Wolfe, superintendent of building for the county Department of Public 
Works, said Ligar will be allowed to continue to work on the house under a 1955 
building permit (his second for the house) until the job is completed. Ligar 
estimates that may take another two years. 
</P>
<P>
The triangle pattern is repeated throughout the house. The roof, with its heavy 
redwood beams, reflects the triangular pattern. The mailbox is in the shape of 
a triangle, and even the sidewalk is laid out in triangles. 
</P>
<P>
The large rock walls give the house the appearance of a fortress, a look Ligar 
said is fitting on a street called Presidio. Ligar said he personally built the 
walls with more than 350 cubic yards of concrete and 360 tons of rock trucked 
in from Malibu beaches. 
</P>
<P>
He hired contractors to help put up 20 tons of reinforcing steel, he added. In 
hand-building the walls, Ligar was careful not to put rocks of the same color 
or size next to each other and to fill in the spaces with smaller rocks to give 
the wall a solid, natural appearance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it has taken so long, Ligar said he can't estimate how much he has 
spent on his labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the completed walls and roof, much of the 1,700-square-foot house 
remains open to the elements. The hole for a swimming pool is built into a 
slope above the house. There are plans to include a waterfall, and there is a 
concrete room designed as a 1950s-era bomb shelter. Inside, the living room is 
dominated by a large rock fireplace. Much of the rest of the house is 
unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
Ligar, who studied architecture at USC and now lives in Huntington Park with 
his mother, said his critics want to force him to abandon the home because they 
don't understand what he is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to bring things down to their level of understanding, and if they 
can't do that, then they reject it," said Ligar, who was born in Russia to 
Greek parents. 
</P>
<P>
The design, he said, is called "organic because it gives the appearance of 
being created by nature as if it grew out of the ground, rather than just being 
parked on it." 
</P>
<P>
The same concept was used in his design of a house completed in 1955 on Cantada 
Drive in the Hollywood Hills that became known as the "Beehive House" because 
of its domed, circular design. The house actually has 24 sides, each angled so 
slightly that it appears to be round. A free-standing round fireplace is at the 
center of the house. 
</P>
<P>
To Ligar, most contemporary architecture is big business, not art. "It is a 
business profession of pseudo-intellectualism and hush-hush, underhanded public 
relations work," he wrote some time ago. "True merit and expression of deep, 
creative feeling have no place. Architecture has lost no audience or glamour -- 
there is a plethora of both. All it has lost is architecture." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Wright, 59-year-old grandson of Frank Lloyd Wright, is familiar with 
Ligar's architectural practice, which he still maintains. "He was a great 
admirer of my grandfather," Wright said. "I saw his house when it was under 
construction in the late '60s. It was very much built in the style my 
grandfather called organic." 
</P>
<P>
And even though some View Park residents sneer at it, others have grown to 
appreciate the house over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"It adds something special to the community," Patricia Yeldell said. "People 
are always stopping to admire the wall. My husband is 41 years old and he 
remembers seeing (Ligar) building the house as he walked by on his way to high 
school. That was over 20 years ago."

TENANTS' ANGER FLARES AT HEARING ON PROPOSAL TO SELL JORDAN DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pandemonium reigned Friday night at a packed public hearing at the Jordan Downs 
housing project in Watts as angry residents, suspicious over a plan to sell the 
project to a private developer, heckled an attorney for the Los Angeles Housing 
Authority and shouted claims that housing officials were lying. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Burke, an attorney hired to explain to residents the plan to sell Jordan 
Downs to a private firm that would spend $14 million to repair the 700 
dilapidated and aging apartment units, was unable to complete her presentation. 
A heckler repeatedly interrupted her, shouting accusations of corruption among 
housing officials and refusing to turn the floor over to other tenants waiting 
to speak. 
</P>
<P>
The agitated woman was led out by friends and security guards just as a second 
heckler, who admitted he was not a resident of the project, commandeered the 
microphone and told the cheering crowd of about 600, "The Housing Authority's 
already got enough money (to fix Jordan Downs) so don't you believe them!" He 
was led away by security guards. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which tenants learned of this week, would allow a private developer 
to buy the 50-acre project, which houses 3,150 people, for $10 million to $20 
million. The firm would be required to undertake a massive modernization 
program at the dowdy 34-year-old project. 
</P>
<P>
But rumors dominated the raucous 1 1/2-hour meeting in the project's gym, as a 
group of about 20 tenant leaders and angry residents repeatedly accused the 
Housing Authority of having already asked the federal Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to allow the sale of the project or of having already sold 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Leila Gonzalez-Correa, the agency's executive director, assured residents that 
the project has not been sold and cannot be sold without approval of HUD, which 
will not receive a formal proposal from the Housing Authority until public 
hearings and negotiations with a tenant representative have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
Shouts came from the audience: "You have lied to us before!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter Demanded 
</P>
<P>
One group -- from among the 20 or so residents who did most of the shouting -- 
demanded a letter from Gonzalez-Correa assuring them that the project has not 
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most outspoken, Dorothy Tolliver, a longtime resident, claimed that 
Gonzalez-Correa has come before them in the past with plans for improvements 
that were never made. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the City Council gave Jordan Downs a loan for plumbing and 
electricity, and we want to know what happened to the money," she demanded to a 
roar of approval from the audience. "There's too many crooks -- that's what 
happened to the money." 
</P>
<P>
However, Burke pointed out that the $818,000 emergency loan from the City 
Council was not meant for replacement of the original plumbing and wiring at 
Jordan Downs, a repair job that will cost an estimated $3.2 million. The City 
Council loan was actually intended for repairing extensive damage to 42 
uninhabitable units and emergency repairs in 100 other units, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Clear 
</P>
<P>
Despite the display of anger by critics, it was not clear whether most of those 
at the meeting felt the same way. Even though people in the audience 
continually drowned out Burke with their complaints, less than one-third of the 
600 present raised their hands when a tenant leader went to the microphone and 
asked for a show of hands of those wanting to keep the Housing Authority as 
their landlord. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, several residents said during interviews that they have a 
"wait-and-see" attitude and believe that a private owner might be able to do a 
better job than the Housing Authority. 
</P>
<P>
Burke repeatedly assured residents that they would not be moved off the Jordan 
Downs site during renovation by a private developer but instead would be moved, 
in groups of 50 families at a time, into vacant apartments at Jordan Downs 
while their apartments are renovated with new wiring, plumbing, kitchens and 
bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leaky Toilets 
</P>
<P>
But several residents, who in recent years have seen only some exterior paint 
applied and replacement of leaky toilets, despite promises of greater 
improvements, made it clear that they do not trust the word of officials on any 
of the points discussed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Harris, who said she was angry over past promises of agency officials, 
asked what assurance she would have that the temporary apartment she moved into 
would be livable, and she challenged the ability of a private developer to 
revive Jordan Downs.

"Personally, I'd (be willing to) wait . . . for the regular Housing Authority

AL MARTINEZ: WISHES IN THE RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He had come out here from Philly, where it was 18 degrees, hoping for what he 
kept referring to as Your Famous Los Angeles Sunshine. What he got was snow in 
Malibu, sleet in Hollywood, rain in Santa Monica and a biting wind at the door 
of his downtown hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," he kept saying as I led him through what seemed like an 
end-of-the-world blizzard to the car where my wife waited. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really sorry about this," I said, feeling somehow guilty that he had come 
to L.A. looking for summer just as God was reminding us who was in charge. It 
wasn't the first time. When a friend came to town last month, an earthquake off 
the coast shook our house with such vigor that her gin and tonic sloshed around 
in its glass. 
</P>
<P>
"My goodness," she said, startled. Then she stared at me as though I were 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"Continental drift," I explained apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
She said "my goodness" again and was on edge the remainder of the evening, no 
doubt anticipating a final jolt, a last grand slosh of her booze and then a 
freeze-frame and fade out. I saw her lips move in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Our guest from Philly was named Richard. When we reached the car my wife said, 
"Welcome to Anchorage." 
</P>
<P>
"This is really unusual," I said, as though in Philly they had no idea of what 
the weather was normally like in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," Richard said. "The cities of eternal sunshine are going to hell. 
Riots in Miami and now snow in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
"This is so rare," my wife said, "we don't even know how to talk about it. I 
heard a newscaster say the snow was pouring down." 
</P>
<P>
We passed accidents caused by icy roads, necessitating delays on the Hollywood 
Freeway. I apologized for that too and honked my horn as though at my signal 
the traffic would part, the way the Red Sea parted for Moses. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is at a standstill," my wife said. "All we need now is for Kadafi to 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all because of the Arctic air," I explained feebly, wishing I hadn't said 
that. The man was a university professor with a degree in Euclidean geometry. 
He knew something about everything, including Arctic air. 
</P>
<P>
When we reached our restaurant the service was slow because a waitress was 
snowbound near Newhall. The place was packed and there was only one waitress 
working our section. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really sorry about this too," I said to Richard. 
</P>
<P>
"Like he said, it's the Arctic air," my wife added. "We ran into it in 
Milwaukee once." 
</P>
<P>
After dinner we braved the elements again for some late-night conversation at 
our home. I hadn't seen Richard since 1985. There was catching-up to do. 
</P>
<P>
As we drove up a rain-washed Topanga Canyon I said, "Can you believe they're 
still talking about a drought in California?" 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people, not enough water," my wife said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we ought to do is make everyone whose last names start with 'A' line up 
along the Ventura Freeway and ship them to Omaha." 
</P>
<P>
"Did I tell you I had cancer?" Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a feathery nonsequitur dropped lightly amid my witless humor. At first I 
wasn't even sure he had said it, so swiftly had the comment come and gone. I 
drove in silence as the windshield wipers swished the rain away. I didn't know 
what to say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK," he said, laughing slightly at my discomfiture. "They think they got 
it all." He leaned closer, attempting lightness. "They blame it on the Arctic 
air. That's why I came to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
I was still tongue-tied but my wife came to the rescue. "Hang on," she said. 
"Spring is just around the equinox." 
</P>
<P>
The cancer was discovered in a routine examination and it scared the hell out 
of Richard. Even when they told him the prognosis was good he was afraid they 
were wrong and had it triple-checked until he was satisfied. Then he decided to 
take some time off and travel. I've seen that kind of odyssey before. It was a 
quest for renewal. One reassesses on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as we talked, I realized Richard meant it when he said he loved the 
stormy mixture that was sweeping L.A. "Stop apologizing," he said. "When I was 
a kid we made wishes in the rain. This is perfect." 
</P>
<P>
He flew out yesterday morning, when the sun shone on the snowy peaks and 
rain-wet trees glistened in the vivid light. L.A. greeted the day looking like 
a woman in love, full of dreams and wild colors. I was glad Richard had come to 
visit this week. He saw us in a way that was rare and exhilarating. He was 
right. There was nothing to apologize for. It was a perfect time to make a 
wish.

The first weapon that anti-war activist Jerry Rubin wielded against a Venice 
store was a petition. 
</P>
<P>
When that didn't work, he resorted to a spray gun Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin and a handful of activists painted a "No" (slash) symbol across a 
12-foot-tall store sign on Ocean Front Walk that depicts a hooded man firing a 
handgun -- hand-cannon might be more accurate -- in the direction of 
sunbathers. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, director of the Alliance for Survival, believes the sign imparts a 
"violent message" in a community already plagued by violence, noting that it 
has since inspired others to pock the wall with real bullet holes. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the clothing store, Local Heroes, initially said the ad would be 
"toned down." When it wasn't, Rubin's brigade showed up, writing on the 
storefront, "Wanted -- Venice Artists for ideas on how to make (this( sign less 
violent." Store personnel blotted out the message Friday but declined comment 
to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who admitted that tampering with someone else's private property is 
"risky," said he still hopes that the sign will be modified, perhaps so that 
the figure is aiming a dove and an American Flag, instead of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Degradable garbage bags seem like a great concept. That's why City Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky had the city's General Services Department look into the claims 
by some companies that they had invented plastic bags that would (a) begin to 
disintegrate when exposed to sunlight and (b) finish the process when buried in 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the agency's tests found that the bags stopped degrading when buried. And 
if left above ground, they required 90 days of sunlight to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
As one General Services agent noted, there could be a problem finding somewhere 
to set thousands of bags of garbage outdoors for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
So, for now, degradable bags rank down there with such other failed 
technological experiments at City Hall as a talking trash can (1983), which 
contained a hidden speaker urging people not to litter, and battery-powered 
toilets (1987-1988), whose pop-out plastic covers scared people. 
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that one reason that Osco decided to resume the Sav-on name 
at its Southland drug stores is that its moniker sounds like the Spanish word 
asco, which means sickening. 
</P>
<P>
That might come as a surprise to some Anglos, as would a few other translations 
for melodious local names. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Restaurant Row is on ritzy Swamp Boulevard (La Cienega). Pacific 
Palisades is the home of the fashionable Street of Fleas (Las Pulgas). And La 
Canada Flintridge has its very own Vagrant Street (El Vago). 
</P>
<P>
In honor of, or perhaps in spite of, Valentine's Day, Family Planning Centers 
of Greater Los Angeles plan to distribute free condoms today at a booth on the 
Venice boardwalk. The fashion-conscious will be pleased to know that designer 
condoms are also available for a small charge.

ANOTHER WOMAN IN MERCEDES ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 37-year-old woman was robbed shortly after she pulled her Mercedes-Benz into 
her garage, adding to the growing list of "follow-home robberies" plaguing 
residents of affluent areas of the San Fernando Valley and West Los Angeles, 
police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Judy Sklar was confronted in the garage of her home on Benedict 
Canyon Drive south of Mulholland Drive by a robber who took her jewelry and 
cash at noon Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been assigned to a task force of Valley detectives investigating 
30 similar robberies or attempted robberies since mid-October in which drivers 
of expensive cars were followed home by armed robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Sklar was not injured and because of poor lighting in the garage, was unable to 
tell police if the robber was armed with a gun, as in the other cases. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the robberies have occurred in San Fernando Valley hillside areas from 
Sherman Oaks to Woodland Hills, with 12 in Encino. Nine have taken place in 
West Los Angeles. More than $300,000 in cash, jewelry and furs has been taken.

THINK THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS FRIGHTFUL? GUESS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your child's school was closed. Your car would not start. A carpet of snow 
blanketed your spring bulbs. Brrrr! This is one wicked winter we're having, 
right? Guess again. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the unusually frigid temperatures that have chilled Southern 
Californians during the last 10 days or so, meteorologists say that overall, 
the weather in the Southland this winter has been just plain average. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess with all the extremes of the past couple weeks, people forgot that the 
season has really been pretty mild," said meteorologist Dan Bowman of 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it's been cold lately. Snow -- the heaviest in 40 years -- piled as high 
as five feet in the mountains north of Los Angeles earlier this week, while a 
dusting turned parts of the San Fernando Valley into a slushy playground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Balmy 
</P>
<P>
But while the low temperature in downtown Los Angeles has averaged 10 degrees 
below normal for February, it hasn't beat any records. On Monday -- the 
chilliest day of the cold snap -- the downtown low of 34 degrees was almost 
balmy compared to the record low for that day of 28 degrees, set in 1883. 
</P>
<P>
And during November, December and January, the mercury hovered right around the 
historical monthly average in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"It just hasn't been a very remarkable winter," Bowman said, adding that a 
warming trend later this month could quickly balance the brisk temperatures 
that have announced February's debut. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been unusually wet, either. Despite the recent showers, rainfall for 
the year in Los Angeles is lagging about two inches behind the average of 9.16 
inches. Statewide, the precipitation has done little to ease fears that 
California is heading into a third consecutive year of drought. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lowest Maximum Temperature 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only wrinkle raising eyebrows in the meteorology community lately 
is that the high temperatures haven't been very high. In downtown Los Angeles, 
the temperature climbed to only 53 degrees Tuesday. Previously, the lowest 
maximum temperature for that day was 54 degrees, a record set in 1949. It 
happened again Wednesday, when the high of 51 displaced the old mark of 52 for 
that date recorded in 1895. 
</P>
<P>
The cloud cover is to blame for this phenomenon, Bowman said: "If there's 
surface heat, the clouds act like a blanket and trap heat in. But if the sun 
can't get through in the daytime, it just doesn't warm up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WINTER TEMPERATURES 
</P>
<P>
Although February temperatures have been 10 degrees below normal at Los Angeles 
International Airport, the winter was just plain average -- -- until the Arctic 
storm arrived.

ON ROAD AGAIN: SNOW-CLOSED I-5 REOPENS

Interstate 5 -- closed since Tuesday by snowdrifts up to 5 feet deep -- 
reopened Friday, clearing a path to most of the 4,500 motorists and residents 
stranded in the mountains north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans crews managed to scrape away enough snow to open four of the freeway's 
eight lanes at about 6 a.m., permitting the California Highway Patrol to escort 
vehicles through on the still-icy pavement at about 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m., the last flurries from the three-day storm had moved east, the sun 
was shining, all eight lanes were open, the pavement was largely dry and 
traffic was moving pretty much as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures pushed above freezing for much of the day in the Gorman and Lebec 
areas, and in downtown Los Angeles, the thermometer climbed to 64 degrees. 
Forecasters said weekend weather in the Los Angeles Basin should be sunny, with 
highs in the upper 50s to low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
With the improved weather, most of the residents and motorists along Interstate 
5, the state's principal north-south artery, were able to start moving about 
first thing in the morning Friday. But it took people in the isolated back 
country around Lebec, Gorman, Frazier Park and Holiday Valley a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Yates family, which had begun to get anxious Thursday as food and propane 
supplies started running low at their rural home in Holiday Valley, finally 
made it out Friday when a friend with a four-wheel-drive vehicle came to their 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
It was not an easy trip for the husband and wife and their two young sons, 
though. They had to wind about three miles through drifts up to 4 feet deep to 
the nearest paved road and then another 10 miles or so on icy pavement to 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cracker Barrel General Store in Frazier Park, about five miles up Mt. 
Pinos Road from the interstate, a dozen locals gathered for the first time 
since Tuesday to drink coffee and compare notes. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about the worst storm in more than a decade, the hard work digging 
out and the two days of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a lot more kids nine months from now," Harry Petretti said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Gelinas said that even though all of them had been stuck in their homes, 
that did not mean that neighbors were not watching out for one another. 
</P>
<P>
"We called on the phone to make sure that everyone was OK," she said. "That's 
the nice thing about a small community." 
</P>
<P>
Back beside Interstate 5 in Gorman, trucker Mark Williams watched dejectedly 
from a roadside service station Friday afternoon as other vehicles whizzed 
past. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had stopped to drop off his load of gasoline at the station late 
Tuesday night, "and by the time I got unloaded, I couldn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
Stuck for two days in the snow, he finally appeared to be on his way Friday 
morning when a bulldozer cleared a path in front of his truck. But when he 
stepped on the starter, he said, "the battery was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the warmer weather was a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's high temperature reading of 64 degrees in Los Angeles was only four 
degrees below the normal high for the date, but it was 24 degrees below the 
88-degree reading last year, a record for Feb. 10. The low temperature Friday 
was 51 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Beusterien, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., a Wichita-based firm 
that provides forecasts for The Times, said that today promises to be a "great 
day" in the Los Angeles Basin -- "some clouds but a lot of sunshine, with highs 
in the upper 50s to low 60s." 
</P>
<P>
It should be a little cooler on Sunday, with a few more clouds. By Monday, 
Beusterien said, a new storm system moving south along the coast "should park 
on Los Angeles and stay around for a few days," bringing general cloud cover 
and scattered showers on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

CONGREGATIONS' RESPONSE TO AIDS ACCENTED; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. VIDEO ENCOURAGES 'EDUCATION . . . ACROSS DENOMINATIONAL BOUNDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new documentary video designed to help churches and synagogues across the 
nation to respond to the challenges of the spread of AIDS has been produced in 
Los Angeles, where it was released Thursday at a premiere showing. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-minute video, "AIDS and the Church's Role," has broad ecumenical backing 
and tells the story of people and congregations facing the problems of 
ignorance, prejudice and fear surrounding acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
and the steps they have taken to meet them with faith, hope and love. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the film," said producer-director Keith Wintermute, "is to 
encourage education and response across denominational bounds. . . . The church 
needs and deserves to be involved in this work." 
</P>
<P>
The video was produced by CARD Inc., a private company that provides churches, 
schools and community organizations with films on AIDS, substance abuse and sex 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The film features support groups for AIDS patients at St. Thomas the Apostle 
Episcopal Church in West Hollywood, St. Athanasius and St. Paul Episcopal 
Church in the Echo Park area and Casa Nuestra Senora de Los Angeles, an AIDS 
hospice established by the six Roman Catholic hospitals of the Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overcoming Confusion 
</P>
<P>
People appearing in the film include Rabbi Allen Freehling, spiritual leader of 
a Reform Jewish congregation and founding chairman of the Los Angeles County 
Commission on AIDS; Tom Houston, former president of World Vision 
International, the Monrovia-based Christian relief organization; Dr. Joel 
Weisman, chairman of the board of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, 
and John Howlett, manager of public relations for the Los Angeles Opera and an 
AIDS patient. 
</P>
<P>
Freehling notes in the film that AIDS patients have often been referred to as 
"modern-day lepers." He speaks about overcoming the confusion, anxieties and 
stereotypes that he says all too often paralyze even well-meaning religious 
groups from ministering positively to those with the devastating virus. 
</P>
<P>
Freehling also took a crusading role in lobbying the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors to pass a law to ban discrimination against AIDS carriers. 
</P>
<P>
On a divided vote, the supervisors this week approved a wide-ranging measure 
that allows people to sue if they believe they have been discriminated against 
in businesses, schools or health facilities because they are infected -- or 
suspected of being infected -- with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
The video's producers are seeking to distribute it free of charge to 200,000 
congregations throughout the nation through a corporate sponsorship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Frightening Curiosity' 
</P>
<P>
The film points out that most medical experts agree that the immunodeficiency 
virus linked to the AIDS epidemic is not spread through casual contact. The 
script does not moralize about the ways AIDS is transmitted through promiscuous 
sex and contaminated needles used by intravenous drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, AIDS was "a frightening curiosity to most of us," Gene Webster, the 
video's narrator and a former editorial director for KABC-TV News, says in the 
film. Noting that an estimated 1.5 million individuals are infected and that 
every congregation of any size will be affected, Webster says the challenge is 
how churches and synagogues can show AIDS patients "love and compassion" rather 
than "lock them outside the church's walls. . . . That responsibility has often 
been overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jon Bruno, rector of St. Athanasius Church, said in an interview that 
his congregation's AIDS support group had helped the 270-member parish grow in 
size and commitment as "we focus on the issue and our diversity." Six members 
of the parish have died of AIDS in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Need My Love' 
</P>
<P>
"I've cried a lot more in the last three years than I've ever cried before in 
my life, because I've watched people waste away in my arms as I've held them. . 
. . They have become more than a pastoral experience for me, for they have 
become people who live and breathe and need my love," Bruno said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the AIDS video "will help the larger community because it 
demonstrates that family-oriented churches can take a stand and not be hurt in 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Wintermute said that CARD Inc., which stands for Community Alcohol 
Related Diseases and is based in Channel Islands Harbor near Oxnard, is selling 
"AIDS and the Church's Role" for $39.95 through mail orders. It is the 
organization's third video on AIDS.

ST. ANNE'S PARISHIONERS WON'T LET CHURCH DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COLUMBIA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Anne's Catholic Church, erected in 1856 by gold miners in this historic 
Mother Lode town, has been abandoned twice but refuses to die. 
</P>
<P>
The small, stately, red-brick edifice with a bell tower standing on a hill 
overlooking this old gold camp is said to be the oldest brick church in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
By 1910 the population of Columbia dwindled to but a few, and St. Anne's -- 
sorely neglected and in great disrepair -- was closed and boarded up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Stripped 
</P>
<P>
The remaining handful of parishioners stripped the church of its original 
valuables -- statues, a marble baptismal font made in Italy, the Stations of 
the Cross, the organ, pews and kneelers, the altar, prayer and song books -- 
and stored them in their homes for safe keeping. 
</P>
<P>
In time the front and back doors were ripped off by weather and vandals. Cows 
and horses, not worshipers, took shelter in the old church. 
</P>
<P>
A stark reminder of the past was the lichen-covered tombstone engraved with the 
names of 50 early members of St. Anne's dating back to the 1850s. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1920s, church officials decided to sell the church and move the 
remains and grave markers from St. Anne's to the Catholic cemetery in nearby 
Sonora. 
</P>
<P>
But San Francisco attorney William Solari and others whose families had 
established and been members of the gold miners' church had other ideas. The 
attorney's father, Pietro Solari, migrated from Italy to the gold camp with his 
wife, Rose, and operated a grocery store in Columbia. He died and was buried in 
the church cemetery in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Artifacts Returned 
</P>
<P>
William Solari and a group of Columbia residents, with the help of the Sons and 
Daughters of the Golden West, raised money, restored St. Anne's and brought the 
old red-brick church on the hill back to life. All the valuable artifacts in 
storage in private homes without exception were returned to the church. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, history repeated itself. St. Anne's was condemned again. Time had 
taken its toll and the structure was not earthquake-proof. 
</P>
<P>
Services were no longer being held in the church. Parishioners removed all the 
valuable artifacts including the pews and kneelers and stored them in their 
homes as their parents and grandparents had done 64 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Catholic Church authorities sold an historic church in Jamestown, not 
far from Columbia, and placed St. Anne's on the market for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rafael Solari and his brother, Jerome, an attorney -- both from San 
Francisco and sons of William Solari and grandsons of Pietro Solari -- and 
members of eight other Columbia families, who were parishioners of St. Anne's, 
formed SOS -- Save Our St. Anne's committee -- to once again come to the 
church's aid. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to raise enough money to make St. Anne's structurally safe and 
restore her to her original beauty," Angela Brown, 40, told church authorities. 
The Solari brothers contributed $10,000 to start a rescue fund. 
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 years, $90,000 has been raised for earthquake-proofing and 
restoration of St. Anne's. It has been a slow and steady process with Masses 
being said from time to time, and baptisms, weddings and funerals conducted in 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
There is a new roof. Steel beams have been installed to ensure the building's 
stability. Walls and ceilings have been strengthened and a new electrical 
system was installed. James Fallon's original altar paintings have been 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bell Rings Loud and Clear 
</P>
<P>
The church bell, cast in New York, shipped around the Horn to San Francisco and 
brought by wagon to Columbia in 1857, rings loud and clear once again for every 
church activity. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have Mass here every Sunday and fill the church if only there were a 
priest available. But there is a shortage of priests and this is a small 
parish," said Glenn Rouse, 77, a director of SOS with his wife, Marie. 
</P>
<P>
Mass is said in St. Anne's at least once a month by Father Michael Kelly of St. 
Patrick's Church in Sonora and by other visiting priests. 
</P>
<P>
And, the 133-year-old church on the hill overlooking Columbia continues to be a 
living, vibrant church, a tribute to the miners and their descendants who 
refuse to let St. Anne's die.

INVISIBLE WOMEN, BLIND MEN; 
</P>
<P>
BARBARA TUCHMAN WAS SEEN WHERE IT COUNTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE, Carolyn See has titled her next novel Making History. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If a man is a writer," Barbara Tuchman once said, "everybody tiptoes around 
past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female 
housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not 
professional.' " 
</P>
<P>
When she died Monday, Barbara W. Tuchman had won two Pulitzer Prizes and had, 
at the age of 77, yet another book, "The First Salute" on the best-seller 
lists. But Tuchman was still very much a part of the locked-door theory of 
education and knowledge. She didn't have a Ph.D. She had used that time slot in 
her early life to marry a nice man and produce three children. By this harmless 
(some might even say productive) activity, she had rendered herself invisible 
to the history Establishment. She worked steadily, did reams of research, wrote 
marvelously readable books, but the more she did, the more "they," the guys 
inside the ivy-covered walls, couldn't/wouldn't see her. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, it's nothing new. In 1928, beside herself with exasperation, Virginia 
Woolf lectured about the locked doors of the university system. She conjured up 
the fictional university of "Oxbridge," where women might hang around on the 
margins of things but still might not take a degree. She railed at male 
academics who thought they had it nailed; who thought they controlled the 
knowledge, the culture, of the time. So furious was she that she fell back on 
the time-honored female occupation of making fun of how those scholars looked: 
". . . Others, though not past middle age, seemed creased and crushed into 
shapes so singular that one was reminded of those giant crabs and crayfish who 
heave with difficulty across the sand of an aquarium." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Woolf went on to be a very famous novelist whose books are still in 
print, while few of those on the faculties of Oxford and Cambridge from that 
time (which remember, in those days, she was not allowed to attend), are 
remembered by anyone at all. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, a lowly British journalist named Brenda Maddox visited the 
preeminent James Joyce scholar, Richard Ellmann, in his Oxford digs, 
respectfully asking if he thought there might be material for a book on Nora 
Barnacle, Joyce's wife. Ellmann said no, Nora wasn't important, and besides, he 
was a Ph.D. and he'd already done a book. But Maddox went on, wrote her book 
(which won a passel of prizes) and incidentally uncovered a raft of Joyce 
letters that the great scholar had suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
Whew! Lucky for everybody that Brenda Maddox was locked out, not the owner of a 
Ph.D., to all intents and purposes invisible. Otherwise, somebody might have 
gotten embarrassed. Just as, when Barbara Tuchman wrote "March of Folly," 
taking as her subject the "wooden-headed" errors committed by men in leadership 
positions, all the way down through history from Troy to Vietnam, some men in 
current power might have taken offense (or God forbid!) even changed their 
ways, except that Tuchman was locked out, degreeless, still invisible, even 
with both her Pulitzer Prizes, her secure niche on the best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
None of this, by the way, is about men and women. It is about systems of "Us" 
and "Them." When I was a first-grader at St. Dominic's Elementary School, the 
nuns taught us that the whole world was divided into Catholics and 
non-Catholics. (That system, so convenient in the first grade, ceased to apply 
when our age hit double digits.) Armenians, historically beset upon from all 
sides, have evolved a system of Armenians ("Us") and "Odars" (everybody else). 
In public America, the system has narrowed down and narrowed down; our world 
has become a place of momentous conflict between Some Guys. For the working 
classes, it's the Rams and Raiders crashing into each other on Sunday 
afternoons, with multiple injuries, and winners and losers. (And "invisible" 
ladies: cheerleading if they're young, making Super Bowl buffets if they've 
already borne children.) For intellectuals, our world is pretty much described 
and defined to us by White Guys, usually from the American East. Some of them 
own toupees; some have earned Ph.D.s. They're very nice, by and large, until 
somebody tries to open their doors, get inside their system. Then they get a 
little peevish. (Who can blame them?) 
</P>
<P>
But outside these systems, this grid of knowledge-as-football -- of leadership 
as Super Bowl contest between "Us" and some "Evil Empire," all that sort of 
thing -- "invisible" people keep doing their own work and redefining the 
universe in ways that the system can't see. Maybe -- listen to this! -- maybe 
Barbara Tuchman wasn't invisible; maybe her fellow historians locked inside 
their university walls were blind as bats, dopey as crayfish heaving with 
difficulty across the sands of the cosmic aquarium, totally impervious to and 
unaware of the lovely, delicate Tuchman fish swimming in circles above all 
those crabby scholars. 
</P>
<P>
More and more "invisible" people keep coming into view these days. A whole 
Latino exhibit, for instance, down at the County Museum. Frank Romero, a 
Chicano Guy who's been drawing pictures of cars all his life, suddenly gets his 
cars inside, pinned up on Establishment walls. Gilbert Lujan hauls an 
honest-to-God real Chevy inside those hitherto almost always locked doors, and 
suddenly this Chevy is visible, even though Romero and Lujan didn't exactly 
make it by the academic route. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Partly, all this is written in bad faith, by a genuine Ph.D. who believed in 
the system and has an unreadable 535-page doctoral dissertation to prove it. 
But when I was in graduate school at UCLA in the '60s, a lot of bright Bruins 
and Trojans thought that they were going to change the world. Out there on the 
margin, making canapes and giving parties to further their husbands' promotions 
-- in between having a total of seven children -- two invisible faculty wives, 
having, as Tuchman once described her own condition, "no status whatsoever," 
wrote their first and second and third novels. Today, Diane Johnson is a 
MacArthur Prize winner; Alison Lurie has her Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the message is this: Wake up, Boys! Unlock those doors! Let's have a 
conversation or a dance instead of the same old intellectual football game. 
There's a bigger world out there than you know, something beyond your 
Establishment credentials. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that Barbara Tuchman missed out by never being quite accepted 
by the history Establishment. But other voices from the invisible world are 
whispering, shouting, calling out: It's the Establishment who missed out in not 
quite having accepted Barbara Tuchman.

DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAXES CREATED BY PROPOSITION 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rebuttals to your excellent editorial on Proposition 13 display an amazing 
logic. They seem to say that it is not fair, not consistent with our system, to 
tax everyone on the same value basis. The "fat cats" of Brentwood, Bel-Air, 
Palos Verdes, etc. believe it is their God-given right to sit on properties 
whose values appreciate at a far faster rate than the average, or of inflation 
in general, then, at their convenience, sell at huge profits having enjoyed the 
largess of taxes at a small fraction of their less fortunate neighbors over the 
years.

DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAXES CREATED BY PROPOSITION 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behold the ultimate irrationality. 
</P>
<P>
We own a one-half undivided interest in a 5-unit apartment house in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. County tax assessor in his wisdom and according to Proposition 13 
assessed our half interest at $162,500 and the other half interest at $66,440. 
This in 1982 when my wife's father deeded his half interest to my wife for a 
"no money consideration," the other half owner being another family member; the 
assessor declared that under Prop. 13 he had the "right" to reassess the half 
of the property that was transferred even though there was no "sale." 
</P>
<P>
The result: In 1988, owner A paid approximately $870 taxes on her half 
ownership; owner B paid approximately $2,030 tax on her half ownership. 
</P>
<P>
How does anyone justify this?

Some of your readers defended the passage of Prop. 13 by starting that prior to 
July 1, 1978, there was doubt whether citizens had the right or the privilege 
to own property. This means that Prop. 13 gave everybody the "right" to 
ownership. Of course, this happened because someone else is being forced to 
pick up their share of property taxes. I wonder what would happen if these 
people, who cried out so loudly that taxes were making it impossible to own 
their own houses, had to fork over their fair share of taxes instead of forcing 
the rest of us to carry part of their burden?

DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAXES CREATED BY PROPOSITION 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest the letters (Feb. 2) concerning Proposition 13. Frankly, I 
found both sides of the debate persuasive. On the one hand, it is unfair when 
two people living side by side in houses of the same value are paying 
drastically different taxes, based merely on when they bought their houses. On 
the other, if someone bought a house for $50,000 the fact that the house is now 
worth, on paper, $100,000 does not necessarily mean that the owner has the 
ability to pay a higher tax. 
</P>
<P>
I think there is a very equitable solution. Taxes on property should rise along 
with the property value. However, an owner of property can decide to pay only 
the portion of that tax which would have been applicable at the time the 
property was purchased, increased by a maximum of 1% per year. The balance of 
the assessed taxes would be deferred until such time as the property owner 
either realized a profit on the sale of the property or died (in the case of a 
home owned by a husband and wife, when both die), at which time the balance due 
would be assessed against that profit or against the estate. The owner could, 
if desired, pay a greater portion or all of the tax when due, and avoid this 
later payment. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of identical property will be liable for identical taxes, but no owner 
will be taxed out of property based upon a paper increase. Only when an owner 
actually sees the profit from increased value will that owner's fair share of 
taxes become due.

LIFE IN THE POORHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Letter writer Rod Britten (Jan. 30) is surely being facetious when he feels 
that "poorhouses" speak of a kinder, gentler age. 
</P>
<P>
The term "poorhouse" is a Scottish term. The English equivalent was "the work 
house." They evolved in England and Scotland in the 17th Century. They were run 
by local and district authorities, usually at the Parish Council level. It was 
intended that these "houses" would be used by orphans, paupers, and the aged 
and infirm. People were admitted only when they had no visible means of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
It was not free lodging. Everybody was expected to fulfill their work task -- 
usually, a filthy occupation such as sorting hemp or jute. In the unsanitary 
conditions without heat and adequate diet many paupers soon succumbed to the 
harsh conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, peasants would often prefer to perish in their hovels rather 
than submit to the attentions of the work houses. 
</P>
<P>
They were abandoned in England in about 1864 as more humane institutions were 
adopted to house the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Poorhouses -- a period of history that would have no place in modern-day 
America.

CONTROVERSY OVER GUN CONTROL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of course, I don't enjoy the perspective of Davis on the gun control issue, but 
it does appear to me those favoring control have offered compromise over and 
over again only to meet with adamant opposition from the gun lobby and its 
friends in national and local legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is the National Rifle Assn. has mounted effective campaigns at every 
level to block attempts to regulate plastic guns, Teflon-coated ammunition, 
Saturday night specials, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing anti-gun forces of "sitting like pigs in the middle of the road" is a 
cop out. The pun is intentional.

CONTROVERSY OVER GUN CONTROL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) says that he has heard "precious little" 
from those who would support him in stopping the spread of weapons of war ("To 
Ban Assault Weapons, Voices Must Be Heard," Op-Ed Page, Jan. 30). I am happy to 
add my voice to his. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see semiautomatic and automatic assault guns banned from sale 
to the public, and, if it could be accomplished, those guns already in the 
public's hands confiscated (with compensation). There is no legitimate reason 
why anyone should want or need such a gun. I commend the owner of Grant Boys in 
Costa Mesa who has added his voice by withdrawing these weapons from sale in 
his store. 
</P>
<P>
If Roos knows that poll after poll has shown that the vast majority of 
Californians supports the banning of these guns, why do his fellow legislators 
not know it? Or if they do know it, why do they not act as elected 
representatives and do what the vast majority of their constituents want?

MORNING BRIEFING: LASORDA HAS TALE FOR MOST EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Ferguson and the rest of the Dodger coaches were honored at a luncheon 
benefiting the Hollenbeck Youth Center Thursday, reminding some of a story 
Manager Tom Lasorda likes to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson was catching for the Dodgers during a game at Dodger Stadium, Mickey 
Hatcher was playing third base and there was a runner on third with two out. 
Normally, if a grounder is hit to third in that situation, the play is to first 
for the easy out. 
</P>
<P>
"A grounder was hit to Hatcher, and I'm getting ready to watch his throw to 
first," Lasorda said. "If you're the catcher on the play, you run down to first 
to back up the throw. 
</P>
<P>
"So where does Hatcher throw the ball? He throws home. And the amazing thing is 
Fergie is there to make the play. 
</P>
<P>
"Hatcher comes off the field and I say, 'What the hell are you doing throwing 
home with two outs,' and he says, 'I thought there was one out.' 
</P>
<P>
"Then I turn to Ferguson and say, 'Why weren't you running to first to back up 
the throw?' 
</P>
<P>
"And Fergie says to me, 'When you play with dummies you have to think dumb.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who holds the NBA All-Star records for most field goals attempted 
and most field goals made in a single game. (Answer to follow.) 
</P>
<P>
A network executive was somewhat taken aback the other day when Harold 
Rossfields Smith, who served four years for embezzling $21.3 million from Wells 
Fargo Bank, called to pitch Olympic middleweight Roy Jones Jr., whom he said he 
was promoting. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he obtained a promoter's license, Smith said: "My problem wasn't 
boxing, it was banking." 
</P>
<P>
From Bruce Keidan of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, on schools who have said they 
voted yes on Proposal 42 by accident: 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't there anyone who voted for Proposal 42 on purpose? Maybe you ought to 
have to score 700 or higher on the SAT to qualify as a delegate to the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. convention. Some of the delegates to this month's 
convention apparently could not spell cat if you gave them a three-letter head 
start." 
</P>
<P>
From Bob Smirzik of the Pittsburgh Press: "This is greed: About the same time 
his agent said no to a $2-million offer from the Boston Red Sox, pitcher Roger 
Clemens was charging $8.50 for an autograph in the Boston area. How much money 
to you need, Roger?" 
</P>
<P>
Talk about stretching for an angle. This comes from a CBS-TV press release: 
</P>
<P>
"Although George Washington and Abraham Lincoln weren't around when Dr. James 
Naismith invented the game of basketball in 1891, the former chief executives 
would undoubtedly have enjoyed watching two of the NBA's best teams battle on 
the day commemorating their births. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were alive and owned a television, they could do just that when 'The 
NBA on CBS' presents the Houston Rockets at the Cleveland Cavaliers, live on 
President's Day, Monday, Feb. 20." 
</P>
<P>
For the record: Pete Maravich did, indeed, score 66 points for LSU against 
Tulane on Feb. 10, 1969, and the score of the game was, indeed, 110-94, but it 
was Tulane that won, not LSU, as reported here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Rick Barry holds the record for most field goals attempted, 27 
in 1967, and Wilt Chamberlain and Michael Jordan share the record for most 
field goals made, 17. Chamberlain got the record in 1962 and Jordan tied it 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
William Sanders, on why he wants his son Barry to bypass his senior year at 
Oklahoma State: "If he's going to play 11 games next year, he might as well 
play 16 and make some money."

FOR THE RAIDERS, AN UNEASY PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER A TURBULENT SEASON, SHANAHAN, DAVIS TO TRY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year was a little tricky for marriages. There were the celebrated 
Tyson-Givens nuptials and, closer to home, there was a kind of domestic-strife 
dark horse, the troubled partnership of Al Davis and his new coach, Mike 
Shanahan, which rumbled throughout the Raider season. 
</P>
<P>
And just when you thought it might be safe to go back into the Raider front 
office, we get the sequel: 
</P>
<P>
A.D. and Mike, II: The Off-Season. 
</P>
<P>
There have been reported firings of two of Davis' favored assistant coaches; 
retentions of the same at Davis' order; actual firings of longtime Raider 
retainees Charlie Sumner and Willie Brown with Davis' permission; Sumner 
blasting Shanahan publicly; the subsequent firing of a "Shanahan assistant" -- 
receiver coach Nick Nicolau -- by Davis after Nicolau had asked several old 
Raider assistants why they were sticking around when they weren't wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Actual events pale, however, before the rumors that have swept through the 
front office: that Davis is trying to force Shanahan out; that Shanahan is 
trying to make Davis fire him; that Shanahan has been calling the University of 
Florida to inquire about the coaching job there; that Davis and Shanahan are 
locked in a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Are these straits dire, or what? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not that dire. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we have a power struggle?" says Shanahan, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got all the power. I've got all the struggle." 
</P>
<P>
"Seriously, we communicate every day. We talk about the decisions we have to 
make to improve this football team. No one's happy about a 7-9 season." 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to be happy, period. Of all the coaches involved, only Shanahan is 
talking at all. Davis said through a Raider official that he may be available 
later but that he will be tied down by the press of business until late this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Said one of his intimates: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get the feeling there's anything out of whack going on. For them, 
there's a lot of upheaval because they're not used to this. They've never had 
it before. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see those guys shaking. Al has always been loyal, they've always had a 
job. They see Charlie and Willie go, and they think they might get whacked 
next." 
</P>
<P>
It the situation seems to fall short of the worst imaginings of Raider 
underlings, it still suggests serious problems: a test of wills between the two 
principal Raiders; an indication that they are having trouble talking directly 
to each other, and worst of all for the organization, proof that the coaching 
staff was split and faces an uphill battle to come together. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, everything's peachy. 
</P>
<P>
BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE 
</P>
<P>
The problem centers on the proud Raider tradition, its philosophy of how to 
play the game . . . and the fact that for the first time, Davis went outside 
his organization for a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
He didn't think he had a suitable candidate on his own staff. Whether Tom 
Flores resigned, or was nudged out, or was told to fire some of his favorite 
assistants and preferred to leave himself, it seems clear that Davis wanted to 
shake things up, bring in some new blood and breathe new life into the Raider 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But just how much new life? 
</P>
<P>
Evidence suggests -- though Davis has strenuously denied it -- that he was 
leaning toward Dan Henning, the Redskin assistant who was just named San Diego 
Chargers coach by Steve Ortmayer, Davis' former aide. But apparently 
negotiations between them broke down late on a wide front of issues, including 
Henning's desire to change the offensive numbering system. Then Joe Bugel, the 
other Redskin assistant Davis liked, immediately took himself out of the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, at the end of a month-long selection process, Davis was left 
with two candidates: Shanahan, the Denver Broncos' offensive coordinator, and 
holdover Tom Walsh. Davis liked Walsh, a protege of Davis' own mentor, Sid 
Gillman, but not enough to make him head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Davis seemed to make a late try for another option, interviewing Jerry 
Rhome, a third Redskin assistant, who had just taken the offensive 
coordinator's job at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Then Davis announced the winner: Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
The two had agreed on what they wanted to do with the Raider system. Of course, 
their understanding seems to have been misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, according to a source close to him, thought that Shanahan had pledged to 
keep the essentials of Raider philosophy -- power running, long passing -- 
while updating the system . . . and then threw the whole system out. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan told his own intimates that he had only been asked to promise one 
thing: that he would take a look at everything before throwing anything out. He 
said he didn't, in fact, throw everything out, what with four Raider receivers 
averaging 17 yards or more a catch. 
</P>
<P>
There was another underlying message in the search process: It wasn't going to 
be easy to bring a coach in from the outside who would believe in Davis' system 
and accept his participation, as had Flores and John Madden. Davis had just 
spent a month scouring America and had wound up with a single viable entry. 
</P>
<P>
If problems arose with Shanahan, who else could he expect to find out there, 
and how? 
</P>
<P>
Problems arose, all right. 
</P>
<P>
THE OUTSIDERS 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 Raider assistants, Shanahan was allowed to hire three: Alex Gibbs, 
the highly rated Bronco offensive line coach; Nick Nicolau, another former 
Bronco, and Pete Rodriguez as special teams coach. If coaches often have 
coordinators imposed on them, as Buddy Ryan was on Mike Ditka by George Halas, 
they almost always do better than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, this was the Raiders, and everyone knows who the boss is. 
</P>
<P>
As one of them puts it: "You have to say the Pledge of Allegiance and the 
prayer, too. There's no separation of church and state on the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy to merge the staffs of bitter division rivals, and it's harder 
when one of the rivals is the Raiders, with their institutional posture of 
being hated, enjoying it and doing things in their own style -- the oft-cited 
Raider way. 
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions from the start that the Raider holdovers, used to a less 
structured, more relaxed regime, were rolling their eyes at the new order. 
There were Raider assistants who took months to start talking to their new 
brothers from Denver, who were referred to as "the Denver guys." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, meanwhile, was trying to do what he had promised everyone he would do -- 
keep his hands off, give his new coach some freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, once the season started and results weren't forthcoming, he kept his 
hands off in his way -- with much anguish and gnashing of teeth, private and 
otherwise. Obsessive, tormented and not keen on identifying himself with any 
kind of failure, Davis is less like Marlon Brando as the outlaw biker in "The 
Wild One," and more like Captain Ahab in "Moby Dick," imposing his demons on 
his crew. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, word spread far and wide that Davis was unhappy. In case the crew 
had missed it, Davis made it formal after the fifth game of the season, a 
blowout at home by the Cincinnati Bengals, after which he convened a late 
Sunday night meeting and threatened to fire two assistant coaches on the spot, 
one of them Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
Said Davis that night, in his peculiar Brooklyn-Dixie accent, according to a 
source: "This is mah . . . lahf they're . . . with." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, low-key and soft-spoken but a young man who thinks he knows his own 
way and intends to follow it, weathered the storm. The Raiders made a late run 
but fell apart down the stretch. Needing only to beat the Seahawks at home in 
the finale, the Raiders lost and missed the playoffs for the third straight 
season, a record dry spell for the team under Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment revealed the old splits. A source said that during the Seattle 
game, Nicolau and Art Shell, the Hall of Fame-bound Davis favorite, got into an 
argument on the sideline and continued it later that week, with Nicolau saying 
to Shell, "Al owns you." 
</P>
<P>
On this note, the off-season began. 
</P>
<P>
THE INSIDERS 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan says he told all the assistants that he would evaluate things, but 
they were all free to talk with other teams in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
This is something more than the usual postseason address, and there can be 
little doubt that Shanahan intended to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
Sumner said he thought over what Shanahan had said, wasn't sure what it meant, 
and went back in to ask about it. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh isn't saying what he was told, but even if Shanahan said no more, Walsh 
had reason to believe he was history. Walsh, the quarterback coach and the man 
on the other end of the headset, hadn't had a good working relationship with 
the new head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The story broke in the newspapers that Walsh and Joe Scannella, the running 
back coach, had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly it broke the other way. The firings of Sumner and Brown were announced 
. . . as the only ones. Walsh and Scannella were still on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh had reportedly called Davis to thank him for the opportunity, etc. Davis 
was reportedly surprised at the news and declared that Walsh and Scannella were 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, defensive line coach Earl Leggett resigned and went to work 
for the . . . Broncos? 
</P>
<P>
Right you are, Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
Leggett was a valued assistant, the man who had scouted, recommended and 
developed Howie Long, Bill Pickel, Sean Jones and Greg Townsend, all long shots 
from obscure programs, all of them selected after the first round of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Leggett, however, is thought to have been the other assistant Davis was 
threatening the night of the Cincinnati game. After that, there was pressure 
from upstairs to play a four-man line, even while some of the players were 
pleading with Sumner and Leggett to let them go to a three-man front on running 
downs. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after all the heads that were supposed to roll had rolled, Nicolau was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolau had asked Scannella and one or two other old Raiders why they were 
staying on when they weren't wanted. Davis had found out about it, been 
incensed and fired Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
No one else has been fired, but the year is still young. 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS ALL 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan's three-year contract supposedly had a clause that said that if he 
resigned, he couldn't work anywhere else, so he was trying to get himself 
fired. Shanahan was supposedly calling Florida weekly to see if Galen Hall 
would be fired. He wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan said that his contract has no such clause, and that he hasn't called 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who recommended Galen to Charley Pell (then the Florida coach)," 
Shanahan said. "I called up Galen to tell him I never talked to anybody. I just 
wanted him to know, I never have called." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was reported to be trying to force Shanahan out. 
</P>
<P>
Said a Davis intimate: "Al doesn't operate that way. Force him out? If Al had 
definitely made up his mind he'd made a mistake, he'd fire him. Al doesn't have 
to apologize for anything. 
</P>
<P>
"Al thinks Mike is an extremely bright guy, a guy with a lot of ability. He 
didn't do as well as Al thought he would do, but he thinks that maybe if they 
change some things, they'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
Does Davis, in the cold light of day, think he made a mistake hiring Shanahan? 
That one has gotten out and been published, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he considers it a mistake that he went outside his organization for 
the first time, because of the way the Raiders are structured," said another 
Davis confidant. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Raiders, everything was done according to their system. Player 
acquisition was done with a view to how they'd fit with the way the Raiders 
played. Al finds it disruptive that they're not philosophically together. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he thinks Shanahan is not a good football coach. I think Al 
probably blames himself for what happened as much as he blames anybody else. 
But he's willing to see what happens next season." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Davis and Shanahan might not have been as philosophically different as 
last season suggested. There were inexperienced quarterbacks who required a 
simplified game plan, and a late-arriving Bo Jackson and a re-simplification, 
etc. That's what they have this season for, to see which way it will go. 
</P>
<P>
What we're left with doesn't quite add up to everyone smiling for the team 
picture. If there was no more to do except finally get everyone on that same 
hallowed page football people always talk about, it would be work enough for a 
dozen off-seasons. But they are going to have to get it done in one. 
</P>
<P>
That's your Raider way.

When Luc Robitaille and Bernie Nicholls saw that John Tonelli was going to fire 
a long shot at the Washington Capitals' net early in the overtime, they both 
rushed in to help sweep up, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
They were both swinging, but it was Robitaille who finally brushed the puck 
past relief goalie Clint Malarchuk 1 minute 39 seconds into the overtime period 
to give the Kings a 7-6 victory -- their first victory on the road since just 
before Christmas. They had gone 0-5-3 since winning Dec. 23 at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time we won on the road," Robitaille said. "If we want to win in 
the playoffs, we're going to have to start winning on the road." 
</P>
<P>
While Robitaille was dancing on the toes of his skates in celebration, a groan 
went up from the 18,130 fans at the Capital Centre, who had their hopes set on 
a replay of the Kings' January visit, when they led, 4-2, but finished in a 4-4 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
That game crossed Robitaille's mind when the Kings were ahead, 4-1, in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself, 'Oh, I hope we're not going to do the same thing we did the 
last time,' " Robitaille said. "At 4-4, uh-oh. At 5-4 (after Robitaille's first 
goal put the Kings up at 3:55 of the third period), I thought we would win. 
But, after that, I didn't have time to think anymore. We just had to keep 
scoring more goals. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a lot of goals. All you can think is, hey, we have to get another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
During regulation, the Kings' six goals were scored by six players -- Nicholls, 
Tim Watters, Tonelli, Jay Miller, Robitaille and Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls scored after the puck bounced back from a block by Larry Murphy, 
answering the goal that Rod Langway had scored earlier, and the first period 
ended in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Watters scored on another close-in goal to put the Kings ahead, 2-1, early in 
the second period. Tonelli put a rebound over prone Washington goalie Pete 
Peeters at 4:07, and Miller followed up a shot by Ron Duguay just 18 seconds 
later to give the Kings their 4-1 lead and to chase Peeters back to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Bryan Murray said that he made the goalie change because 
Peeters had given up three quick goals, and four on 9 shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping that the change would make a difference, and it did," Murray 
said. "Our team was able to get back into the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals scored the next three in a row. Dave Christian scored from the 
right side on a pass that Kelly Miller pushed across from the left side. Geoff 
Courtnall pulled the Capitals within a goal in the last minute of the second 
period with a slap shot down the middle, and Mike Gartner tied it, 4-4, just 
2:05 into the third period. 
</P>
<P>
After Robitaille's goal made it 5-4, Courtnall's second tied it at 6:22. It was 
Courtnall skating in on Glenn Healy again when Watters ran him down and checked 
him -- into Healy. While the two were still in a heap, Steve Leach came into 
the picture, picking up the loose puck and putting it into the net to put the 
Capitals ahead, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky kept the Kings alive by taking a pass from Mike Allison behind the net 
and putting it into the left corner of the net with 11 1/2 minutes left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
As time ran out, Nicholls and Robitaille were attacking Malarchuk. One last 
shot in regulation bounced off Malarchuk's shoulder and then off his mask, 
according to the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way they would both come up empty in the overtime. As Nicholls put 
it: "Luc gets pretty hungry when the puck is down low like that. But it doesn't 
matter who scores the goal, as long as it goes in." 
</P>
<P>
Tonelli, who was pretty busy all night, had taken the puck away from Courtnall 
to set up his high-scoring teammates with the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny worked well tonight," Nicholls said. "The first shift, we had the 
coaches shaking their heads again, but we kept working and kept working. It's 
guys like Johnny Tonelli, who have those Stanley Cup rings, who are showing us 
what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille noted how hard Tonelli had worked and added: "If you see that and 
don't work hard, too, you feel kind of guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings (29-22-5) moved back ahead of Edmonton into second place in the 
Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
"Every team goes through a slump from time to time, and you just have to work 
your way out of it," Nicholls said. "I'm not saying we're out of it yet, but 
tonight was a good start." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
After the Kings' loss to the Boston Bruins on Thursday night, owner Bruce 
McNall again was asked about Coach Robbie Ftorek's status. McNall is still 
saying that despite the slump, and despite the "problems" to which players have 
obliquely referred, he wants to avoid a "revolving door of coaches" if at all 
possible. Asked if he felt convinced that Ftorek is the right coach for the 
Kings, McNall said: "No. Not necessarily. But I'm not necessarily sure that he 
isn't, either. I'm not a thousand percent sure of anything right now. I'm the 
same as the players and the coaches. I'm a little confused. I know there are 
problems, but I don't have any brilliant answers. We'll have to see how it 
plays out." McNall has issued no ultimatums and has set no time frame for 
deciding on whether Ftorek's contract will be extended beyond this season. But, 
when pressed, he said: "I will be mightily disappointed if we don't get out of 
the first round of the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Once again the Kings were outshot, but this time it was just by 28-26. They 
have been outshot in five of their last 24 games. Their 19 shots at Boston 
represented their lowest total of the season.

HILL ESCAPES SERIOUS INJURY IN ACCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
DRAGSTER TAKES TO THE AIR IN A SPECTACULAR CRASH AT POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eddie Hill survived what many Pomona drag racing old-timers say was the most 
spectacular accident in the 36-year history of the Fairgrounds strip Friday and 
former winner Connie Kalitta turned in the sport's second-fastest run in 
qualifying for the Chief Auto Parts Winternationals. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 52, a drag racing veteran from Wichita Falls, Tex., appeared headed for a 
near-record run in his bright yellow top-fuel dragster when it suddenly became 
airborne at about the 1,000-foot mark. The 27-foot 6-inch dragster climbed like 
an airplane taking off from Brackett Field, just across the street from the 
racing strip. 
</P>
<P>
The rear end, with Hill in the roll cage, soared straight up and the front end 
came down on its nose, pirouetting through the timing lights. The impact sent 
one wheel sailing 50 feet in the air as the crumpled dragster, pieces falling 
off, flopped over on its side. 
</P>
<P>
A brief fire erupted in the parachutes, which trailed along the ground, but 
quickly went out as the car slid to a stop up against the barrier in the wrong 
lane. Arley Langlo of Goleta, who was in the other lane, had to drive around 
Hill's car to avoid hitting it. Langlo's car sustained front end damage from 
broken pieces that were strewn across the strip. 
</P>
<P>
Before National Hot Rod Assn. Safety Safari personnel could reach Hill, he was 
unbuckling himself and crawling out of the cage. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened so sudden it was out of my hands," Hill said later from the San 
Dimas Hospital, where he was taken for observation. "Once I started crashing I 
covered my face with my hands and closed my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud the man upstairs let me do it again. I think he wants me to do it as 
much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, a former drag boat record- holder, once bounced across the water like a 
skipping pebble at more than 200 m.p.h., breaking seven bones and suffering 
multiple cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
This time he apparently escaped with little more than bruised knees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thankful that I landed right side up," he said. "Both my knees are dinged 
up. I tried to ball up like I learned in boat racing. You know, whatever sticks 
out goes in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I was obviously on a good pass and I don't think I was late lifting (off the 
gas pedal). It seemed to me like the car was already in the timing lights when 
it happened. What injuries I got were probably self-inflicted. My right knee 
hurts worse than my left. I know it'll be sore tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
NHRA officials said that the front end was so high in the air that it was the 
rear wheels that triggered the timing lights. 
</P>
<P>
The car, even though apparently damaged beyond repair, was still clocked at 
5.210 seconds and 236.15 m.p.h. That was 11th-quickest after two rounds of time 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
Drag racing old-timers, including Wally Parks, founder of the NHRA, could not 
recall a more frightening accident than Hill's. The most spectacular before 
were generally felt to be Larry Reyes' flip in the Hawaiian Dodge in 1969 at 
180 m.p.h., and Tommy Ivo's engine explosion at the finish line after a 
209-m.p.h. run in 1974 when his car ended up a rolling ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he expected to be back on the starting line today. 
</P>
<P>
"Get me another car," Hill told crew chief Fuzzy Carter as he was climbing into 
the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Several drivers, including 1987 Winston World champion Dick LaHaie and Darrell 
Gwynn, offered their backup cars to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Carter apparently decided to take Gwynn's chassis, but Hill will have to 
qualify it today if he hopes to get into Sunday's 16-car elimination. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's car, after it was swept up and placed on a truck bed, looked like a 
picked-over carcass. 
</P>
<P>
The frame was bent, the fuel tank was twisted, punctured and leaking fuel -- 
which apparently set the parachutes on fire -- all the wheels were damaged and 
there was a gaping hole where the left rear wheel had been ripped away. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, after the track had been cleared of the debris, Kalitta raced 
his '87 model top fueler through the lights at 288.46 m.p.h. The only faster 
run ever recorded was a 288.73 by Hill in the Gatornationals final last year at 
Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd had the old speed trap, I'd have had a 290 for sure," Kalitta said. 
"The NHRA made a study of the difference between this year and last year and 
figured speeds were about a mile and a half slower." 
</P>
<P>
The length of the speed trap, where top speeds are measured, was shortened by 
66 feet this year as a safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
Kalitta's car, built by Chuck Kurzawa of Detroit and powered by a Keith Black 
engine, gave indication of its performance last Thursday when it ran 286.25, at 
that time the Pomona track record. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do anything special, we just had everything working right," said 
Kalitta, who won the Winternationals in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"We've still got some work to do before Sunday, though. We're having trouble 
getting our ET (elapsed time) down where we want it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Kalitta's record speed, his ET of 5.105 seconds is only fourth behind 
defending NHRA champion Joe Amato, Dennis Forcelle and Gary Ormsby. 
</P>
<P>
Amato ran a Winternationals record 5.042 to take the No. 1 spot after two 
rounds. Two more rounds are scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunn, a former U.S. Nationals funny car champion from Ontario, set both 
speed and elapsed time records in his '88 Cutlass when he ran 279.85 m.p.h. in 
5.346 seconds. The old records were 276.24 m.p.h. by Scott Kalitta, Connie's 
son, and 5.395 seconds by Ed McCulloch of Hemet, both set last year. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn already held the track record of 280.72, set during the 1987 Winston World 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Bernstein, defending four-time national funny car champion, made it 
safely into the field with a conservative run of 5.623 seconds, but Don (Snake) 
Prudhomme, another four-time national champion, failed for the second time to 
post a quick time. The Granada Hills veteran, who holds the national record of 
5.305 seconds, has two more chances today. 
</P>
<P>
Don Beverley of Chester, Va., was a surprise leader in pro stock with a track 
record of 7.358 in his Cutlass. Nine-time pro stock champion Bob Glidden of 
Whiteland, Ind., was fourth at 7.364 in his Ford Probe.

USC MIGHT CONSIDER DROPPING BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC basketball has sunk to the absolute bottom, and no one seems to care. The 
fans, students and even the administration all apparently have long ago given 
up on the sport. Despite the dismal record this season, only the coach has 
questioned the coaching, and everyone seems content to let the team fade into 
oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
But the team's lack of success goes beyond coaching, poor talent and fan 
support. There has been something fundamentally wrong with the basketball 
program at USC for years. Maybe it's something as basic as not having a 
legitimate home arena, but if the school's attitude toward the sport is going 
to continue, USC should seriously consider dropping intercollegiate basketball 
and using the money elsewhere.

MEADOWLANDS INVITATIONAL TRACK MEET;

<P>
O'SULLIVAN WINS MILE, SETS 1,500 RECORD, TOO

Marcus O'Sullivan set a world indoor record in the men's 1,500 meters en route 
to winning the mile Friday night in the Meadowlands Invitational, while Said 
Aouita and Paula Ivan barely missed world records in scoring sensational 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan, who was chasing fellow Irishman Eamonn Coghlan's indoor mile record 
of 3:49.78 set on the Meadowlands track in 1983, was timed in 3:51.66, the 
fifth-fastest ever. 
</P>
<P>
But his 1,500-meter time of 3:35.6 broke the accepted world record of 3:36.03, 
set by Spain's Jose-Luis Gonzalez in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Aouita, who had said the men's 3,000-meter world record was soft, produced the 
second-fastest clocking ever, 7:39.71, falling short of the mark of 7:39.2, set 
by Emiel Puttemans of Belgium in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Aouita, who disdained a mile showdown with O'Sullivan in hopes of setting a 
3,000 record, had to withstand a furious finish by Steve Scott. Scott, the 
American indoor and outdoor mile record-holder, broke the U.S. record of 
7:41.57, finishing second in 7:39.94. 
</P>
<P>
The American record had been set last year on the fast 10-laps-to-the-mile 
Meadowlands track by Brian Abshire. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Falcon of Arkansas, who finished sixth in 7:46.42, broke the collegiate 
record of 7:48.1, set by Canadian Graeme Fell of San Diego State in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan, the Romanian who won the Olympic gold medal at 1,500 meters last year and 
the silver medal in the 3,000, took the women's mile in 4:18.99, the 
second-fastest ever, behind the 4:18.86 set by her compatriot, Doina Melinte, 
on this track last year. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who just missed equaling the world indoor best in her 
semifinal heat, overcame a slow start and won the women's 55-meter high 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner-Kersee, the 1988 Olympic champion in the women's long jump and the 
heptathlon, had set her goals this year on setting records in the indoor 
hurdles and the outdoor high hurdles and intermediate hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
She nearly got the mark in the preliminaries, clocking 7.38 seconds -- only .01 
of a second off the world best of 7.37 which she had run twice last week at New 
York. The 7.38 broke the meet record of 7.45 set by Joyner-Kersee in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But after the preliminary, she required treatment for an injured right 
quadriceps. In the final, she appeared to be tentative out of the blocks and 
had to work hard in winning in 7.40, holding off a strong bid by Kim McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, the 1984 Olympic bronze medalist in the 100-meter hurdles, finished 
second in 7.42. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gwen Torrence, a 1988 Olympic finalist in the women's 100-meter and 
200-meter dashes, streaked to her 48th consecutive indoor victory since 1986, 
including 24 finals, winning the women's 55-meter dash in 6.65. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Pierce, who worked in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino before quitting this 
week to devote full time to track, won the 55-meter hurdles in 7.04. Tonie 
Campbell, the Olympic bronze medalist finished second in 7.10, and his Olympic 
teammate, Arthur Blake, was third in 7.12. 
</P>
<P>
Another meet record was broken in the women's 800 as Melinte, the 1984 Olympic 
champion, swept past Joetta Clark with one lap remaining and won in 2:00.70. 
Clark , who set the meet record of 2:02.15 in 1987, finished second in 2:00.98. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Dixon led all the way in winning the women's 400 for the sixth time, 
equaling the most victories by any runner in this meet. Dixon, leading all the 
way, was timed in 53.51. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dial won the pole vault competition at 19-0 1/4. He then missed three times 
at an American-record 19-5 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
In two races featuring some old-timers, all past 40, Mike Boit of Kenya broke 
the world indoor Masters mile mark, clocking 4:15.48, and Lee Evans, the former 
world record-holder for 400 meters, broke the world Masters best at that 
distance, with a time of 51.60. 
</P>
<P>
Boit, 40, the 1972 Olympic bronze medalist at 800 meters, erased the week-old 
mark of 4:17.88, set by Ron Bell of Britain. In that race, Boit was suffering 
from the flu and had no kick, placing second to Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 41, easily broke the world Masters mark of 53.9, set by Thane Baker in 
1976.

SURFERS SHOULD CHALLENGE WAVES, NOT EACH OTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whose ocean is it? As an active surfer since 1957, I find it a shame that some 
surfers don't understand the value of enjoyment and camaraderie that surfers 
have shared since I began surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging the elements, not other surfers, has been an important part of my 
life. To have to fight your way into or out of the ocean is absurd. It is a 
lower form of animal thinking that brings out territorial rights. Richie 
Collins, as good as he may think he is, has a lot to learn about human rights 
and sharing.

THE NHL SHOULD WISE UP, REQUIRE HELMETS FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After watching the Kings' Ron Duguay smash his head on the ice in a recent 
game, I have to wonder when the Kings, the National Hockey League and players 
who don't wear helmets are going to wise up. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me it would be in everyone's best interest for the league or 
individual teams to make helmets mandatory.

AGASSI WENT TOO FAR WITH BAD BEHAVIOR IN DAVIS CUP MATCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reporting Andre Agassi's arrogance in the Davis Cup competition, Bill Dwyre 
did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
I was appalled when Agassi used a young ball boy to further his "playing to the 
crowd." To make matters worse, the announcers on TV joined the crowd in 
laughter at this youngster's expense as he made his way back to courtside with 
a very red face. 
</P>
<P>
If Agassi is the best we have to offer in the Davis Cup, then I suggest we drop 
out of the competition.

JORDAN HAS STATISTICS TO RANK WITH THE BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reference to a Feb. 4 letter about Michael Jordan's selection to Scott 
Ostler's all-time NBA team: Who in their right mind would not name him to their 
all-time team? 
</P>
<P>
Last season alone, Jordan was league MVP, defensive player of the year, MVP of 
the All-Star game, slam dunk champion and steals leader, and he also earned his 
second consecutive scoring title. He is also the only player to score 50-plus 
points in three consecutive playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
But you're right, he's just a flash in the pan.

HERSHISER'S DEMANDS TURN THESE FANS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I've lost all respect for the uppity Mr. Hershiser. His demand for a salary of 
more than $2 million a year for three years is bad enough, but he also wants 
the Dodgers to promise to pay him if a labor dispute suspends play during the 
1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers or some other club will give him what he demands, and he will be 
counting his blessings while laughing all the way to the bank.

WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY, SPORTS ARE FAIR GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Ostler's column (Feb. 2) was written in such a narrow-minded, cynical, 
(argumentative) way that I wonder . . . why did he wait so long to write it? I 
loved it. Maybe it will wake up that sports fan who thinks he or she knows what 
an athlete is worth. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to money for athletes, a Proposition 48 casualty becomes a genius 
of the financial world, able to coax an extra $200,000 a year from a real 
estate and investment tycoon. Of course, he gets help from a 400-client sports 
agent, but hey, who really cares about all that stuff? As long as they don't 
raise taxes to pay this guy, I can sleep at night and I'll watch the game 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But if I paid $10 for a ticket and was refunded $5 if the home team lost, I 
wonder who I would root for. I wonder if I would have Clipper season tickets. I 
wonder if the Clippers could offer season tickets.

Bill Elliott crashed and Dale Earnhardt spun out during the first day of 
practice for the Daytona 500 stock car race. Elliott, the NASCAR Winston Cup 
champion and a two-time race winner here, suffered a broken left wrist that 
will probably knock him out of action, and the incidents aroused fears that the 
new radial tires are not as safe as believed. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Estes, a spokesman for the Ford teams, said that Elliott told him the 
accident occurred when a tire blew with no warning. Earnhardt, a three-time 
Winston Cup champion, escaped injury when he hit the wall after a tire 
shredded. 
</P>
<P>
Goodyear is introducing its new stock car radial this week. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Schrader turned the fastest unofficial lap, 197.776 m.p.h. Elliott was next 
at 196.859. 
</P>
<P>
In qualifying for Sunday's ARCA 200-mile late model stock car race, Patty Moise 
of Jacksonville, Fla., became the first female driver to win a pole position at 
Daytona Friday when she qualified her Buick at a speed of 195.499 m.p.h., more 
than 2 m.p.h. faster than runner-up Tracy Leslie of Mt. Clemens, Mich., who did 
193.087 in his Pontiac.

A woman filed a complaint last month, accusing Uribe of drugging her beer at

<P>
ARIZONA, PACIFIC 10 STILL SEEKING SOME RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robyn Norwood 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pity poor Arizona. Last year's 35-3 season, replete with a No. 1 ranking and 
Final Four appearance, should have proven that the program is one of the 
nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Wildcats are back at the top of the polls, becoming the fourth team 
this season to be ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Respect? Not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson's Cliff Ellis, not wanting to put his name to any comments, had this to 
say about Arizona: "A person in the coaching profession whom I will not name 
was saying the other day that Arizona might be in the upper division (of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference), but you don't know how many wins and losses they 
might have. Duke won all its games out of league and beat some good people, but 
they're only 4-4 in conference." 
</P>
<P>
Duke, of course, was ranked No. 1 in the preseason, but dropped after losing 
consecutive ACC games to North Carolina, Wake Forest and N.C. State. The Blue 
Devils are 5-4 in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
And while Arizona is being maligned, the Wildcats' star, Sean Elliott, is 
fending off criticism of his ability. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to those who contend that he has some tough competition for player 
of the year, Elliott at least distinguished himself with a comment. 
</P>
<P>
"If those guys are better than me, then why aren't coaches comparing me to 
them?" Elliott asked reporters recently. "It's like that (car) commercial where 
the guy is saying, 'It's just like a BMW.' . . . Frankly, it's getting me a 
little (aggravated)." 
</P>
<P>
But the potshots go with being No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, whose only losses are to North Carolina and Stanford, can only hope to 
hang onto the ranking longer than Illinois and Oklahoma did. 
</P>
<P>
It will become apparent soon. The Wildcats meet the fifth-ranked Sooners 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more debated topics of the season is the quality of the Pacific 10. 
One camp contends that the league has emerged, and is moving toward the peak of 
a cycle. Others say that these teams wouldn't do so well in other leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Blake, the National Basketball Assn.'s director of scouting, as always, 
has an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a young league, and while it doesn't compare with the Big 10, the 
Atlantic Coast Conference or the Big East right now, these things can change 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Blake predicts three first-round draft choices for the Pac-10 in Elliott, 
Stanford's Todd Lichti and UCLA's Pooh Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott and Lichti are continuing to close in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's career 
scoring record, which he set when he was Lew Alcindor. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, coming off a season-low 10-point performance against Oregon, is 70 
points shy of Alcindor's conference record of 2,325 points. Lichti is 176 
behind Alcindor. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State Coach Ralph Miller's farewell tour isn't quite in the realm of the 
one given to Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Miller has received such gifts as a crystal clock and a sculpture, 
but as yet, no motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
For historical perspective, however, Miller's tour is tough to beat. 
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of his final game at Cal's Harmon Arena, Miller, 69, recalled 
his first visit to the cramped, dark facility, which was built in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a palace then," he said, recalling his 1937 visit. "I've changed my 
mind since." 
</P>
<P>
As he recalled his visit 52 years ago, Miller surveyed a youngish group of 
reporters and added, "None of you probably were alive then." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, none of them had been. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, neither was Cal Coach Lou Campanelli, who came into this world on 
Aug. 10, 1938. 
</P>
<P>
After Utah State Coach Kohn Smith made his well-publicized comments about his 
perceptions of Nevada Las Vegas players' life styles, the Las Vegas 
Review-Journal dutifully checked the validity of Smith's charge that Stacey 
Augmon stepped into a car Smith said he himself "couldn't afford." 
</P>
<P>
That would be a 1979 Oldsmobile with a new paint job, according to the 
Review-Journal's search of vehicle registration records. 
</P>
<P>
The nicest vehicle owned by a player was a 1985 Nissan 300 SX owned by David 
Butler, and purchased by his father. 
</P>
<P>
And the least ostentatious mode of transportation? George Ackles, who is 
6-foot-10, rides a moped. 
</P>
<P>
Add Las Vegas: Coach Jerry Tarkanian donned glasses in a game for the first 
time Monday night in a runaway victory over UC Santa Barbara, telling reporters 
he hoped the specs would help officials to perceive him as "more scholarly." 
</P>
<P>
Word was that as long as the Rebels are winning with them, the glasses would 
stay. UNLV promptly lost to Cal State Fullerton in overtime Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of his glasses will be learned Sunday when the Rebels play North 
Carolina State.

REBEL ROUSTERS MEET TONIGHT AT IRVINE

<P>
Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine, two teams that have upset Nevada Las Vegas 
in the past week, meet at 7:30 tonight at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton and Irvine are the only Big West Conference teams that have beaten 
UNLV this season. Irvine beat UNLV, 99-98, last Saturday night. Fullerton 
pulled a 93-92 overtime upset Thursday night on Wayne Williams' three-point 
shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (9-11, 6-5) won the first meeting with Fullerton this season, taking a 
77-73 victory Feb. 2, in a game in which center Ricky Butler scored a 
career-high 23 points. Since then, Butler has scored at least 20 points in two 
other Irvine victories. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, who have won three games in a row, will be trying to put 
together a four-game winning streak for the first time since January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (10-10, 5-6) has won two straight since the loss to Irvine, upsetting 
UC Santa Barbara and UNLV. The Titans' Cedric Ceballos, a 6-foot-7 forward, is 
leading the Big West in scoring, averaging 21.5 points a game. ROBYN NORWOOD

GOLF ROUNDUP;

CARTER LEADS, BUT 66 PLAYERS FAIL TO FINISH

Jim Carter shot a 66 moments before darkness halted play and took a two-stroke 
lead Friday in the rain-delayed and uncompleted second round of the $750,000 
Hawaiian Open at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
The start of play was delayed three hours by overnight rains that flooded 
portions of the Waialae Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six players did not finish. They marked their positions and were set to 
return at daylight this morning to complete second-round play. The third round 
is scheduled to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, seeking his first victory in a tour career that started in 1987, is at 
130, 14 under par. 
</P>
<P>
Of the non-finishers, Scott Simpson appeared to be in the best position. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson was 10 under par for the tournament with seven holes to go in 
second-round play. David Ogrin also was 10 under, but he had only three holes 
to play. Chip Beck was nine under with three to play. 
</P>
<P>
At the overnight break, Gene Sauers held second place at 132 after a 67. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hill, who turned 50 two weeks ago and is playing in his first tournament 
shot one-under-par 71 and weathered a challenge from Al Geiberger to hold on to 
a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the 50th PGA Seniors Championship at Palm 
Beach Gardens, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Hill birdied the first two holes and made par on 15 of the next 16 to finish 
with a 36-hole total of six-under 138 on the windy Champion course at PGA 
National. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger, who led by one shot after 11 holes, followed at 139 after posting a 
70 that featured four birdies and bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes that 
enabled Hill to regain the lead.

USC WOMEN TURN IT AROUND ON UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billie Moore, in her 12th season coaching the UCLA women's basketball team, can 
always be counted on to deliver the brutal truth. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this game probably set basketball back 10 years," she said in 
summing up USC's 90-75 victory over UCLA Friday night at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, UCLA played poorly and USC, while executing only slightly better, 
nevertheless blew away the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The revenge motive seemed to work for the Trojans, who well-remembered the 
Bruins' 76-62 victory at the Sports Arena last month. No one for USC wanted to 
see that happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone knew it," Karon Howell, USC's senior forward said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' guards -- young and skittish -- were the focus of the Trojan 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"That was their game plan," Moore said. "Attack our guards and see how they 
would handle it. They didn't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins committed 20 turnovers and were outrebounded, 49-38. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans led at the half, 48-33. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Linda Sharp was pleased with her team's defensive play, especially in 
contrast to the previous game against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a factor," she said. "We have two seniors here, playing their last time 
at UCLA. They have been on their younger teammates all week." 
</P>
<P>
One of those seniors, Cherie Nelson, was particularly effective. Nelson led all 
scorers with 33 points and had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
USC led by as many as 28 points. Although the Bruins made several small runs at 
the Trojans, they never brought the deficit into single digits. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't start playing our tempo until about 5 minutes to go," Moore 
said. "That's easy to do when you're 24 points down. There's no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Althea Ford had 16 points for UCLA and DeDe Mosman had 14 points, including two 
3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 8-12 overall and 4-6 in the Pacific 10 Conference. UCLA is 9-11 and 5-5.

CUTLASS REALITY FACING OLD PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When it rained for the Breeders' Cup last November at Churchill Downs, the 
owners of Cutlass Reality were stuck in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
Because Cutlass Reality wouldn't have otherwise been eligible, Howard Crash and 
Jim Hankoff paid a $360,000 supplementary fee so that their horse could run in 
the $3-million Classic. 
</P>
<P>
The up side to the investment was that Cutlass Reality could earn $1.35 million 
by winning the race, plus substantially increasing his value as a sire. 
</P>
<P>
The downside was that Cutlass Reality would have to finish at least second for 
his owners to show a profit, and the opposition was so strong that he was the 
fifth betting choice, behind Alysheba, Waquoit, Forty Niner and the entry of 
Seeking the Gold and Personal Flag. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality doesn't run well on off tracks, but if Crash and Hankoff had 
scratched him from the Breeders' Cup, they would have forfeited the $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality was in second place at the top of the stretch, but he quit 
running and wound up seventh, about eight lengths behind the winning Alysheba. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Crash, Hankoff and their trainer, Craig Lewis, may be stuck again, because 
they could be faced with another off track when Cutlass Reality makes his first 
start as a 7-year-old on Sunday in the $250,000 San Antonio Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
If Cutlass Reality doesn't run, the owners are out only their $200 nomination 
fee, but that would leave Lewis with the problem of getting his horse ready for 
the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on March 5 without the benefit of a prep 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Crash and Hankoff, who are investment bankers, have made plans to fly from New 
York for the race and on Friday Lewis acted as though they would have a race to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get a race in him, and I have no other options," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
In a 64-race career that has yielded $1.3 million in earnings, Cutlass Reality 
has won only two of 13 starts in the mud. His last off-track victory was at 
Aqueduct in 1986, long before he became a major stakes winner. 
</P>
<P>
"He prefers a fast track, but I really can't say that the track bothered him 
that much at Churchill Downs," Lewis said. "The caliber of horses that beat him 
was pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, Cutlass Reality was capable of beating that caliber. 
Horse-of-the-year Alysheba lost just twice all year, once to Bet Twice and once 
to Cutlass Reality, by 6 1/2 lengths in the Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 1 1/8-mile San Antonio is considered a traditional prep for the 
Big 'Cap, only two horses in the 1980s -- Bates Motel and Lord at War -- have 
won both stakes. Ten horses are entered Sunday, but some are questionable if 
the track remains muddy. Super Diamond is a sore-legged horse who usually only 
runs on fast surfaces, and Cherokee Colony was scratched from last Sunday's 
Strub Stakes because of an off track. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality, ridden as usual by Gary Stevens, has drawn the rail and will 
carry the most weight, 124 pounds. Outside him, in order, are: 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, with Laffit Pincay, 121 pounds; Frankly Perfect, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, 115; Cherokee Colony, Rafael Meza, 120; Crimson Slew, Alex Solis, 
111; Payant, Bill Shoemaker, 118; Stylish Winner, Corey Black, 112; Good Taste, 
Sandy Hawley, 113; Mark Chip, Russell Baze, 113; and Stalwars, Chris McCarron, 
115. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect and Payant are coupled in the betting, because Charlie 
Whittingham trains both horses and owns an interest in Payant. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Flying Continental, winner of last Wednesday's Santa Catalina, is scheduled to 
run next in the San Rafael on Feb. 26, said trainer Jay Robbins. Another of 
Robbins' stakes-winning 3-year-olds, Raise a Stanza, is headed for Golden Gate 
Fields and the Lafayette Invitational Handicap on March 11. . . . Bruho, 
injured while running second to Music Merci in last year's Del Mar Futurity, is 
back in training.

CANUCKS EDGE SABRES, END FOUR-GAME LOSING STREAK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Tanti had a goal and two assists as the Vancouver Canucks ended a 
four-game losing streak with a 5-4 victory over the Buffalo Sabres Friday at 
Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved the fourth-place Canucks four points ahead of the last-place 
Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Reinhart, Jim Benning, Trevor Linden and David Bruce also scored for 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
For the Sabres, who have lost four in a row, Rick Vaive had a goal and two 
assists. Pierre Turgeon, Phil Housley and Jeff Parker added the other Buffalo 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 1-0 in the first period, Vancouver scored a pair of power-play goals. 
Reinhart tipped in Petri Skriko's shot at 5:45, then had his shot tipped in by 
Tanti at 7:27. 
</P>
<P>
After Turgeon scored his 24th goal of the season on a power play at 15:49, 
Vancouver regained the lead when Benning scored on a 50-foot floater that 
eluded goaltender Darcy Wakaluk at 17:25. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, Vaive tied the game again when he beat Steve Weeks from 
the top of the right circle at 1:09. 
</P>
<P>
But Linden scored his 25th goal of the season on a rebound at 5:58, putting 
Vancouver ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Goaltender Alain Chevrier stopped 27 shots 
as the Blackhawks defeated the Islanders at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrier, who was traded to Chicago from Winnipeg on Jan. 19, has started all 
10 games since his arrival. The Blackhawks are 7-3 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks took a 1-0 lead on Steve Larmer's 32nd goal of the season in the 
first period, and Everett Sanipass made it 2-0 at 7:32 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders scored their only goal on Tomas Jonsson's 25-foot slap shot at 
12:27 of the third period. They pulled Kelly Hrudey in the final minute, but 
Troy Murray scored into an empty net with 29 seconds left.

The U.S. housing industry finished 1988 with an 8.4% decline in completion of 
privately owned units compared to the previous year, the Commerce Department 
reported. For December, completions were down 6.6% from the same month in 1987. 
The December completions were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,517,000 
units, up 5.9% from November but shy of the year's actual total of 1,528,000 
units, the department said. The December results included an annual rate of 
1,085,000 single-family units, up 4.5% from November. The completion rate for 
two- to four-family units jumped 35% to 58,000, while units for five or more 
families climbed 6.6% to 374,000. At the end of the month, the number of units 
under construction was estimated at an annual rate of 958,000, roughly flat 
with a month earlier. They included 605,000 single-family units, 42,000 two- to 
four-family units and 311,000 units for five or more families.

STOCK PRICES PLUNGE; DOW OFF 36.97; 
</P>
<P>
REKINDLED INFLATION FEARS, PROFIT TAKING HURT MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Renewed fears of higher interest rates and inflation -- along with a bout of 
profit taking -- sent the stock market reeling Friday in its biggest decline of 
the year and raised worries that the robust rally of 1989 may have run out of 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger-than-expected jump in producer prices, along with hikes in banks' 
prime lending rate, help push the Dow Jones industrial index down 36.97 points 
to close at 2,286.07. That was the Dow's largest single-day decline since Nov. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
The drop, representing a decline of 1.6%, was broadly felt among other issues, 
as declining issues outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange by more 
than 4 to 1. Big Board volume totaled 173.56 million shares, down from 224.22 
million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the drop was initially triggered by a government report released 
Friday morning suggesting that inflation is higher than earlier believed. The 
report by the Labor Department showed that producer prices -- involving 
finished goods at the manufacturer level -- jumped 1% in January. That was the 
sharpest rise since October, 1985, and at least twice economists' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The rise promptly raised fears that the Federal Reserve Board would continue to 
boost interest rates -- possibly including its all-important discount rate on 
loans to member banks -- in a bid to cool the inflation surge. Perhaps 
responding to that fear, several major banks on Friday raised their prime 
lending rate to 11% from 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds Sold Off 
</P>
<P>
"Many people think a discount rate boost is coming and with the prime rate 
boost, that added gas to the fire," said Norman Mains, director of research at 
the Los Angeles brokerage of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also responded to the new interest rate fears by selling off bonds, 
raising their yields, which will in turn add further upward pressure on 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said investors were disappointed by President Bush's speech to 
Congress on Thursday night, saying that it was short on specifics on how to cut 
the nation's bulging federal budget deficit. Lack of action on the deficit will 
fuel further upward pressure on interest rates, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said investors were ripe to cash in profits after the Dow had 
risen some 8.2% so far this year, through Tuesday. After hitting a post-crash 
high of 2,347.14 on Tuesday, the Dow has fallen 2.6%, including a drop of 20.17 
points on Thursday. For the week, the Dow lost 45.18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also may be pulling some money out of stocks and putting it into 
short-term bonds, which are yielding close to 9%. 
</P>
<P>
"When you can earn a risk-free 8.5% in Treasury bills, why break your back to 
try to get 12% in the market?" said Peter G. Eliades, publisher and editor of 
Stockmarket Cycles, a Los Angeles newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Light Volume Cited 
</P>
<P>
Analysts differed on whether the market would soon resume its upward advance, 
or whether more declines were ahead. But some bullish experts took heart in the 
fact that volume was relatively light. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a stampede to get out of everything," said Donna Hostetler, 
director of research at the Los Angeles brokerage of Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co. 
She noted that prices for smaller stocks did not fall quite as much as the blue 
chip Dow industrials. 
</P>
<P>
She also contended that stocks are still fairly valued by historical standards, 
noting that the price-earnings ratio (relation of stock prices to earnings per 
share) on the Dow was around 10, about half the levels before the October, 
1987, crash. Also, pension funds and other institutional investors are still 
holding high levels of cash, she said. 
</P>
<P>
With such factors, "it's hard to get terribly negative," Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
But other market watchers contended that the market may have seen its best days 
for awhile. While stocks may rebound somewhat next week, prices overall are 
overvalued, newsletter editor Eliades said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Dow as a whole is selling at about 2.3 times its book value 
(the net worth of all the companies in the index). The Dow has reached those 
levels only twice in the past 60 years, once in 1928-29 and again in 1986-87, 
both periods just preceding a crash, he contended. A ratio of 1.5 is more 
normal, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Market Decline 
</P>
<P>
"We are at or approaching a major top," Eliades said, adding that he had 
instructed his subscribers on Thursday to get out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
As far as the performance of individual NYSE issues Friday, 301 stocks rose, 
1,233 fell and 446 were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among blue chips included International Business Machines, down 53 3/4; 
General Electric, down 3/4 at 46 3/4; American Express, down 1 1/4 at 30, and 
Philip Morris, down 1 3/4 at 107 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
But Eastman Kodak, which has discussed cost-cutting plans, managed a 5/8 gain 
to 48 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Williams Cos. dropped 1 to 30 7/8. The company reported a $16.1-million loss 
for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
V Band climbed 1 7/8 to 10 1/4 in the over-the-counter market. Thomas Feil, the 
company's chairman, said he might consider an offer for the company's stock in 
public hands. 
</P>
<P>
As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded 
stocks, the market lost $31.94 billion, or 1.09% in value. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped 2.12 to 
164.01. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.90 to 337.26, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was down 4.04 at 292.02. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market skidded 4.02 to 
402.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at 
322.77, down 2.59. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed mixed in active trading Friday after a late 
rally propelled the Nikkei index to its sixth consecutive record high and 
seventh straight gain. The 225-share index rose 53.56 points to close at 
32,131.99. 
</P>
<P>
Prices fell sharply on the London Stock Exchange for the second consecutive day 
in what was described as a technical correction after the market's sharp surge 
of recent weeks. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 23.0 points at 
2,056.1.

BANK TO SHUT BRANCHES AT 170 K MART STORES; 
</P>
<P>
1ST NATIONWIDE FOCUSES ON ACQUISITION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major reversal of a much publicized move into K mart stores, First 
Nationwide Bank said Friday that it will cease offering banking services at 
convenience branches located in 170 outlets of the discount chain. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco savings bank, owned by nation's second-largest thrift holding 
company and a subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., is the latest major financial 
institution to withdraw banking services from a retail chain. Attempts by banks 
and other major retailers, notably Sears Roebuck, to provide one-stop shopping 
for financial services have been largely unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Sears Savings Bank closed all but one of its 41 branches located 
within Sears stores in California. That same year, Security Pacific Bank and J. 
C. Penney ended a pilot program offering loan and investment products at 
financial centers in J. C. Penney stores in San Francisco, Sacramento and 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide, which has been owned by Ford since 1985, said its 170 
branches in K mart stores -- 71 of them in California -- will be closed March 
10. Account holders will be notified this week, and their accounts will be 
transferred to nearby full-service offices of First Nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for First Nationwide said Friday that the K mart branches accounted 
for about $200 million in deposits of the thrift's total deposits of $71 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priorities Changed 
</P>
<P>
"Although we learned much about offering financial services in a retail 
environment, we have concluded that convenience branches in K marts don't fit 
the company's new strategic focus on its target markets and profitable 
operations," Robert E. Lackovic, First Nationwide chairman and chief executive, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"K mart has given us strong support and we have an excellent relationship, but 
the bank has found it necessary to change its priorities," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's holding company, First Nationwide Financial, has embarked on a 
massive acquisition program over the last year that has dramatically cut into 
its profit. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, it had a profit of $11.6 
million and reported that it owned assets worth $23.5 billion. The year before, 
profit for the nine-month period totaled $51.5 million, and assets were $16.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The change in strategy reflects new management under Ford ownership and an 
expansion program pegged to acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Acquisitions 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide's main priority will be to integrate into its existing 
operations the 150 S&amp;L branch offices it has bought during the last year. 
The result will be a network of about 330 conventional branches in 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
Among the S&amp;Ls it has bought are Columbia Savings and Mile High Savings in 
Denver; Pathway Financial and Uptown Savings, both in Chicago; Cardinal Federal 
in Cleveland; Lincoln Federal in Westfield, N.J., and Bloomfield Savings and 
First Dearborn Federal, both in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"The new strategy is to go to full-service banking in brick and mortar branches 
now that we have the resources of Ford and the new acquisitions," a First 
Nationwide Bank spokesman explained. 
</P>
<P>
First Nationwide, during the tenure of then-Chairman Anthony M. Frank, moved 
into K mart in 1984. Frank, who left in February, 1988, to become U.S. 
postmaster general, used the expansion into the retail outlets as an 
inexpensive and quick way to open branches. Banking services were offered at 
164-square-foot kiosks.

BOESKY TO HOLD OFF ON APPLYING FOR PAROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ivan F. Boesky, the imprisoned speculator at the center of Wall Street's 
insider trading scandal, will not apply for parole from his three-year term at 
a California prison when he becomes eligible next month, his lawyer said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the case, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, 
said lawyers are waiting to see whether high-yield bond financier Michael 
Milken of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is indicted in a case based on 
information supplied by Boesky before seeking early release. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is expected to be charged as a result of Drexel's plea deal, in which 
the securities firm agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts in addition to 
the financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky is eligible for parole from the minimum-security prison camp in Lompoc, 
Calif., on March 21, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. He went to prison 
last March 23. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington attorney Robert McCaw said Boesky has not applied for parole and 
does not plan to in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"He will seek a parole hearing at the point where his advisers think it is most 
likely he would get some kind of favorable consideration," McCaw said. "There 
has been no parole hearing date scheduled. There is nothing imminent." 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys believe an indictment of Milken would be further evidence of the 
value of Boesky's information in weeding out Wall Street corruption. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not on the Docket 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said there was "no chance" Boesky would be released by March on parole 
and "relatively little chance" he would be freed on a judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
Parole hearings at the 689-inmate prison, known as "Club Fed" because of 
facilities including tennis and boccie ball courts, are held every other month 
and Boesky is not on the March docket, Lompoc unit manager Jim Finley said. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Boesky's earliest possible non-parole 
release date based on good behavior is April 4, 1990.

Boesky, once Wall Street's best-known speculator in the stocks of potential 
takeover targets, now works on a prison cleanup crew, McCaw said. 
</P>
<P>
He is likely to be released early only if Manhattan federal judge Morris E. 
Lasker, who sentenced Boesky, rewards his cooperation with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Boesky's lawyers asked Lasker to reduce his sentence on grounds 
that information Boesky gave the government unearthed other fraud cases, 
including the mammoth investigation of Drexel that resulted in a record 
$650-million plea-bargain settlement in December.

FABERGE TO SELL COSMETICS UNITS TO UNILEVER; 
</P>
<P>
ARDEN, BRUT, AQUA NET AMONG FIRMS INCLUDED IN $1.55-BILLION DEAL 
</P>

<P>
Faberge Inc. said Friday that it has agreed to sell its beauty products and 
toiletries businesses -- which include the Elizabeth Arden, Brut and Aqua Net 
lines -- to international consumer products giant Unilever Group for $1.55 
billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is another in a long line of acquisitions in the cosmetics industry 
and one that would give Unilever, a British-Dutch company, a much greater 
presence in the United States. It also would boost the size of Unilever's 
personal products business by more than 25%. 
</P>
<P>
"Unilever has for years planned on becoming more important in the U.S.," said 
Suzanne Grayson, a cosmetics and toiletries industry consultant. "They have not 
been able to do it on their own. So, they have gone about buying companies." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Unilever acquired such well-known American brands as Prince 
Matchabelli fragrances and Vaseline when it bought Westport, Conn.-based 
Chesebrough-Pond's for $3.1 billion. Unilever, with worldwide sales of more 
than $30 billion, also makes such products as Lipton teas, Wisk detergent and 
Lifebuoy soaps. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said $1.55 billion is a high price for the cosmetics and toiletries 
divisions of Faberge, which is owned by New York financier Meshulam Riklis. 
When word of negotiations between the two parties leaked out last month, some 
industry analysts estimated that the divisions would fetch $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"They are are probably overpaying," said Grayson, "but it's going to be worth 
it in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doing 'Very, Very Well' 
</P>
<P>
Under Riklis' ownership, New York-based Faberge has become one of the world's 
largest cosmetics and beauty products companies. Elizabeth Arden, which was 
acquired in 1987, and Faberge reported combined sales of $800 million and 
operating profit of more than $100 million for the fiscal year ending last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been doing very, very well," said Paul Cohen, publisher of Beauty 
Age, a trade publication. "They also have increased the volume of spending on 
the brands, which has helped each one of the brands strengthen their position 
in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said Faberge's chairman, Daniel Manella, deserves much of the credit for 
boosting profitability and sales at Faberge. Manella, reached at his weekend 
home in Palm Beach, Fla., said he will continue working for the Riklis family, 
as he has for the past 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
Manella boosted profit at Faberge mostly by reducing costs, analysts said. 
After acquiring Elizabeth Arden, Faberge moved quickly to meld overlapping 
operations worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We consolidated factories, offices and warehouses all over the world, and we 
did it really quickly," said Manella, who added that Arden's operating profit 
more than doubled within a year after Faberge took over. 
</P>
<P>
Faberge products are divided into roughly two large categories: low-priced 
goods, such as Brut cologne and Aqua Net hair spray, sold primarily at mass 
merchandisers and supermarkets; and higher-priced Elizabeth Arden fine 
fragrances and cosmetics sold in department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Faberge will retain the McGregor Apparel Group, which includes clothing lines 
such as Botany 500, Wonderknit and Billy the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Building Image 
</P>
<P>
Manella said there never were any plans to sell Faberge but that the Unilever 
offer "was something that had to be explored. They are getting a bargain. The 
company will appreciate in value in by several hundred million." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best thing that has ever happened to Arden," said Grayson, 
maintaining that Unilever has the money needed to continue building the brand's 
sales and image. Arden has "not been able to get a younger image," she said. 
"It's a tough business and everybody in the industry is working hard and the 
competition is terrific." 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Unilever said: "The Faberge and Elizabeth Arden 
businesses provide an excellent fit with Unilever's existing personal products 
operations worldwide. Elizabeth Arden's portfolio of brands will provide 
Unilever with a global presence in the prestige segment of the skin care and 
color cosmetics markets." 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the acquisition is one of many in recent years that have 
reduced the number of players in the slow-growing and highly competitive U.S. 
cosmetics industry. In one of the biggest previous deals, Revlon purchased Max 
Factor in 1986 for $345 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The total industry is in the mature phase of the life cycle," said Cohen at 
Beauty Age. "It is normal for to go through a lot of consolidation."

<P>
When it is finished, sometime in 1990, Charles Fuller's "We: An American 
Adventure" will have been a massive undertaking: a collection of five, maybe 
six plays dealing with black life during and after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Fuller's first and second plays have made it to the stage. "Sally" and 
"Prince," running in rep at the Negro Ensemble Company's Theatre Four, are the 
launch-pad of this epic story. Parts 3 and 4 are promised next season and the 
rest next year. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many beginnings, "Sally" and "Prince" are slow, a bit confusing as they 
unravel, but ultimately a straightforward account of the first black regiment 
to fight with Union soldiers against the Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of these plays is the conflicted role of Prince Logan (Samuel 
L. Jackson), sergeant and head of this unit, a model soldier who eventually 
must choose whether to fall in with his men in their struggle for equal pay -- 
or allow them to be shot for insubordination when they refuse to fight because 
of the wage dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The danger here is oversimplification, and Fuller tries to avoid it -- not 
always successfully. We first meet Prince in "Sally," the tale of a Southern 
black widow (Michele Shay) with whom Prince falls in love and has an affair. He 
also develops an affection for Sally's spirited son Yocum (Alvin Alexis), a boy 
with more eagerness than savvy who joins the regiment and becomes Prince's 
personal protege. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Prince's difficult relations with his white superiors that captivates 
our attention and Fuller's attempt to make the white officers compassionate men 
trapped in an inflexible system. 
</P>
<P>
The white general (William Mooney) and his lieutenant (Larry Sharp) admire the 
black sergeant for his discipline and devotion to duty. They also know that 
paying black soldiers $7 a month instead of the $10 the white men get is 
unjust. But they are powerless to change it and run headlong into the disasters 
of living by the letter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
There's no point in divulging more of the plot, which actually promises to grow 
more interesting and complex as new plays develop (it seems that a third piece, 
"Jonquil," about the visionary blind mistress of one of the unit's soldiers, 
has already been written). 
</P>
<P>
The current productions don't live up to the unfamiliar and significant content 
of the plays. Charles McClennahan's raked, bare set and Arthur Reese's flat 
lighting give "Prince" and "Sally" a primitive, bare-bones look. Coupled with 
the softness and slow tempo of Douglas Turner Ward's direction, the stagings 
overall lack the urgency and real sense of action required. 
</P>
<P>
A final question: Is there a screenplay struggling to get out here? So far, 
"We" is a passionate but linear narrative with the potential of developing into 
a full-fledged saga, one that would end in 1900 or roughly where August 
Wilson's series of black family plays begins. Even were these Negro Ensemble 
productions more compelling (curiously, even Shay seems to hold back as Sally), 
it's hard not to wonder if "We: An American Adventure" wouldn't be more 
American and more adventurous as a big screen movie. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 Sheridan Square, meanwhile, no such danger exists. The Ridiculous 
Theatrical Company is having a resurrection that continues the legacy of 
founder Charles Ludlam (who died of AIDS at 44 in 1987) in the person of 
Ludlam's longtime companion, on and off stage, Everett Quinton. 
</P>
<P>
No chance of a movie here. 
</P>
<P>
Quinton gives us a new adaptation of Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two Cities" 
written and performed by him on the flimsiest of excuses. 
</P>
<P>
A baby is left at this contemporary transvestite performer's front door on the 
very night of his big break. In order to quiet the tot while he gets ready for 
his act, Quinton tries telling him stories. Fairy tales don't cut it. Dickens' 
tale of revolutionary exchanges and switched identities in a France ruled by 
the guillotine does. 
</P>
<P>
What are we to conclude? That today's babies love blood and gore as much as 
anyone? Unlikely. More likely it is that this labored event provides the 
Ridiculous with what it has always valued: a tentacled excuse for on-stage 
shenanigans (including a functional bathtub and microwave oven), with plenty of 
colorful characters for Quinton to impersonate (none with so much relish as the 
knitting Mme. Defarge) and a treasure trove of excuses for turning found 
objects into props (such as bird cages for a bustle and a bed for the 
Bastille). 
</P>
<P>
The narrative isn't always sustainable and some of the visual gags run thin, 
but this is the first new text at this theater since Ludlam's death, and a 
piece that, for all its shortcomings (including sheer length and some trashy or 
superfluous jokes) lives up to the ridiculous spirit of the Ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
At least we now know that this cockamamie tradition can have a life beyond its 
creator.

SUTHERLAND'S STAYING POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dame Joan Sutherland has climbed the sacrificial pyre as Bellini's Druid 
priestess Norma 126 times -- probably setting at least a modern record. 
</P>
<P>
Her appearances with Opera Pacific, beginning today at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, will mark immolations 127-130. Then she 
will fly off to Detroit to relight the pyre three times at Detroit's Michigan 
Opera Theatre, another company run by David DiChiera, Opera Pacific's general 
director. 
</P>
<P>
But the end of the sacrifices may be in sight. Sutherland, 62, has pegged 1991 
as her retirement date. 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty much so, I think," she said after a recent morning rehearsal in Costa 
Mesa. "I certainly have not accepted any further engagements for opera 
performances. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of young people around who are just dying to get out there, 
and I don't see why I should hold the slot any longer. I've had it for over 40 
years." 
</P>
<P>
But are any of them Sutherlands? 
</P>
<P>
"That remains to be seen," she said. "If they don't get the chance, then who 
knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland said that she has developed "a certain staying power" with all the 
years of singing. "But, of course, approaching the age that I am, it becomes a 
little more difficult to coordinate movement and voice," she said. "One sort of 
feels one's age sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some have remarked that time has taken its inevitable toll on the 
fabulous voice that led enthusiasts to dub her "La Stupenda." 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly sing parts of the Mad Scene in (Donizetti's) 'Lucia di Lammermoor' 
(transposed) down now," she said. "But certain other things are still in tune. 
It depends. The voice varies from day to day as much as it did when I was 
younger. . . . Some days you can manage things and some days you can't." 
</P>
<P>
She said that "Norma" also will be sung lower. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said I didn't like singing 'Norma' in the original high key, not 
so much because it was difficult vocally, but because I felt it didn't have the 
right sound. It didn't seem to have as much compassion as the lower key. I feel 
that the sound is more dolce, more round, it has more sympathy, the lower key 
has. So we always do it in the lower key." 
</P>
<P>
(According to a statement from conductor Richard Bonynge, Bellini himself 
transposed "Casta diva" and "Mira, o Norma" from G to F for Giuditta Pasta, the 
first Norma; it is this version, largely followed since, according to Bonynge, 
that Sutherland will sing.) 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people bother too much about transposing," Sutherland added. "If 
you can sing well in one key and it's difficult in the other, well, sing it in 
the key that's comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
What about the purists? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the purists don't have to sing, do they?" 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland has been delighting purists and the public since singing in the 
Franco Zeffirelli production of "Lucia" at Covent Garden in 1959. That 
appearance proved the turning point of her career and made her a bel-canto 
superstar virtually overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she attracted and helped further the careers of those who would go 
on to be major stars, including Luciano Pavarotti, Marilyn Horne and James 
Morris, and has sung with many other luminaries, including Montserrat Caballe, 
Carlo Bergonzi, Samuel Ramey, Sherrill Milnes, Nicolai Ghiaurov and Martti 
Talvela.. 
</P>
<P>
She may still be helping the careers of others. She arrives in Costa Mesa with 
a cast of virtual unknowns. Her Pollione is Cesar-Antonio Suarez; her Adalgisa 
is soprano Nova Thomas, a protege of Richard Bonynge, Sutherland's husband for 
34 years and her concert partner for the past four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Oroveso is Georgi Selezneev, a basso with the Bolshoi Theatre for the past 10 
years, who will be making his American debut in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think you'll find they're very worthy," she said about her Opera 
Pacific/Michigan Opera Theatre colleagues, adding that the casting was "a 
mutual agreement between David DiChiera and my husband." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland said she has worked with Thomas and Suarez before, singing the duet 
"Mira, o Norma" with Thomas at the Royal Theater in London in May, and leading 
the "Don Giovanni" cast in Vancouver, in 1977, in which Suarez sang Don 
Ottavio. 
</P>
<P>
(Suarez also sang opposite Beverly Sills in Bellini's "I Puritani" in an 
ill-fated debut in 1977 at the San Francisco Opera. He has apparently 
recovered; he made his debut in December at La Scala in Milan in Rossini's 
"Guillaume Tell.") 
</P>
<P>
Bonynge will conduct the "Norma" performances in Orange County and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
k. Working with Bonynge just makes things easier, she said. "It saves both of 
us a little bit of rehearsing because we know what each other is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland's vocal technique and artistry have rarely been questioned, but she 
has been plagued by criticism about her diction and acting. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in the high areas of voice, it's not very easy to get the consonants 
out," she responded. "But I think that the criticism has snowballed. I'm sure 
that somebody said it once, and everybody has picked it up. . . . I'm sure, 
because sometimes I hear other people singing the same repertoire and I'm 
damned if I know what they're singing, and I know the words, which is more, 
probably, than the critic does." 
</P>
<P>
As for the acting, Sutherland said: "It's a bit difficult, I find, with some of 
the bel-canto pieces, particularly because they are static. . . . You cannot go 
tearing around all over the stage. . . . I don't see what more you can do than 
try to color the voice with the meaning of what it is you're singing." 
</P>
<P>
So don't expect to see Sutherland march up the pyre in any offbeat stagings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand updating or changing locales of operas," she said. "This one is 
as it might have been performed in 1831, perhaps. But I can't bear the thought 
of a sort of punk 'Traviata' or a 'Rigoletto' a la Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland said that she has few regrets about her career. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a wonderful career. It outran anything I ever expected. I just had 
the urge to sing at Covent Garden possibly because I was warned off so much 
that I was just determined to try. Everybody said I was crazy. After all, there 
were a lot of singers around and why should they take me? And I said, if I 
don't go to London and find out, I'll never know, will I? So I went." 
</P>
<P>
The rest is history.

OSCAR, COME HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a sad commentary on today's society that art director Lyle Wheeler's five 
Oscars, including one that he was given for "Gone With the Wind," are to be 
sold ("The Diary of Lyle Wheeler's Oscars," by Daniel Cerone, Feb. 8). 
</P>
<P>
The yuppie couple who by chance came to possess the Oscars remind me of the 
characters in "Gone With the Wind" who tried to buy Tara out from under the 
impoverished O'Hara family. I'm sure that when Wheeler won the Oscar he had no 
idea that 50 years later life would be imitating art. 
</P>
<P>
The five statuettes should be returned to Wheeler immediately as a kindness to 
a man who is so much a part of Hollywood history.

Re "Raising Their Voices to Aid Armenian Orphans" by John Burman, Jan. 31: 
</P>
<P>
Show-biz types have recorded songs to benefit Armenia's earthquake victims, 
starving Ethiopians, American farm families, Bangladesh, AIDS patients and 
other causes. However, no one has written or recorded a song to help the 
victims of the greatest disaster the world has ever known, the Chernobyl 
nuclear accident. This unprecedented nuclear disaster, which will result in 
economic and agricultural harm for hundreds of years, has been swept under the 
rug. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the show-biz folk are selective about disaster support.

FACES . . .: TAKING THE LONG VIEW 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Shawnee Smith, who stars with John Candy in the recently released 
"Who's Harry Crumb?," says she strives to keep her career well rounded, and 
judging from the variety of roles and mediums in which this 19-year-old has 
already performed, she's doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
"A good combination of everything will do me just fine," said Smith, who says 
she is equally comfortable with comedic roles, as in "Harry Crumb," and with 
dramatic roles, as in the remake of the 1958 thriller, "The Blob," or in the 
Los Angeles stage production of "Hands of the Enemy," where she plays the 
daughter of a deaf mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have a nice mix," said Smith, recalling that her work as Meg 
Penny in "The Blob" required a lot of "physical" acting: "I was working with 
this piece of tape that was supposed to be this terrifying thing -- The Blob. 
That took a lot of focus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Smith called working with Candy (who also produced "Harry Crumb") 
"non-stop laughing -- my sides would ache when I was done working for the day." 
Smith plays Candy's tomboy sidekick, Nikki Downing, who, like Candy's 
character, is the black sheep of her family. "We come together and help each 
other feel good about ourselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So what's next for Smith, who began doing commercials at age 8, became the 
youngest actress ever to win the coveted Drama-Logue Critics Award for her role 
in the Los Angeles production of "To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday" in 1985, and 
was a regular on the television series "All is Forgiven" in 1986? 
</P>
<P>
Her dream role is "anything where I could work with one of the 'greats' " -- a

I was especially upset with Previn's motioning for the orchestra to rise before

FACES . . .: ANOTHER KIND OF GOSPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like Aretha Franklin, rock singer/composer Pierce Turner, who plays Wednesday 
at Club Lingerie, traces his music to the church. But Turner's roots aren't in 
Southern gospel but a Catholic cathedral of Wexford, Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I would literally get transported to heaven in church," enthuses Turner, 33, 
in a brogue still thick after 11 years of living in New York. "Being an Irish 
Catholic is culturally a major thing and has a major influence. Musically 
you're raised with Catholic Church music, which tends to be a lot of Bach and 
Mozart and Faure, Gregorian chants, a lot of stuff sung in Latin. That gives 
you a feel for a certain type of Romantic melody and Baroque style." 
</P>
<P>
The influence was emotional as well as musical. In several songs on his 
affecting yet playful new album, "The Sky and the Ground" (the follow-up to 
last year's Philip Glass-produced "It's Only a Long Way Across"), Turner 
expresses longing for the simplicity and grace promised by the shelter of the 
church of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost both my parents in the last two years and it was a very intense thing," 
he says, noting that the self-critical nature of his songs is also influenced 
by Irish writer Brendan Behan. "The whole thing seemed to be too much going on, 
and I wanted to be very simple again, be a plumber or something. The moment 
didn't last long really, but it was one of those things where I wished I had a 
more normal life. But my whole thing about songwriting is I take those fleeting 
glimpses and exaggerate them to the max." 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the new album, Turner uses the hymm "Faith for Our Fathers" to 
re-create the lost feeling of grace. 
</P>
<P>
"As a boy making my confirmation at age 12, I was one of 2,000 boy sopranos in 
church," he recalls. "We took off and flew around the world, with the incense 
burning and the bishop on the altar. It was heavy stuff." STEVE HOCHMAN

'THE FLY II' -- GET A SWATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That "The Fly II" (citywide) isn't called "Son of the Fly" typifies the 
earnestness with which this lame sequel to the 1986 smash attempts to set a 
serious tone. But it is "Son of the Fly" and just might have been more 
entertaining had its makers owned up to that. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the film becomes faintly silly in its dead-seriousness, then slides 
into tedium and triteness. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially a bare-bones replay of "The Fly," it more closely resembles 
countless other routine sci-fi horror pictures. So much dogged determination, 
plus considerable technical flourish, have gone into "The Fly II" that it can't 
be said to be truly terrible, merely ponderous and uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
If you saw the poignant and oddly poetic 1986 film, you'll recall that Dr. Seth 
Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) inadvertently mixed his molecules with those of a 
common housefly during an experiment in the transmission of matter. Now we're 
told that his girlfriend was pregnant and, as the sequel opens, she's giving 
birth at an industrial complex whose owner (Lee Richardson) holds the rights to 
Brundle's cursed device. The woman dies giving birth to a monstrous creature, 
but out of its entrails comes a perfectly formed baby boy. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the kid is exactly normal. He's incredibly brilliant, 
and his growth, carefully monitored, is so accelerated that by the time he's 5, 
he's played by the grown-up Eric Stoltz. And then there are those still-dormant 
"aberrant chromosomes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see what's coming; not helping matters is that there is nothing 
distinctive in the romance that develops between Stoltz and a young scientist 
at the lab (Daphne Zuniga). Richardson proves to be a stock megalomaniacal 
villain. Indeed, so much is so dull that the sheer nastiness of Richardson's 
bullying, dirty-minded head guard (Gary Chalk) livens things up in welcome -- 
albeit pointless -- relief. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fly II" (rated R for much repulsive gore, some sex) is a sleek production, 
featuring a portentous score and an elaborate sound design, but its makers had 
better be braced for unintended laughter.

NICE ACTING, MANGLED HISTORY IN 'YOUNG CHAPLIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Charlie Chaplin's comedy ever seemed a touch too self-consciously poignant 
to you, curl up with your children in front of "Young Charlie Chaplin," a 
three-part, British-made dramatization of his life before the age of 15, which 
begins tonight on "Wonderworks" (7 p.m. on Channels 28 and 50, 8 p.m. on 
Channel 15). But be prepared to rush to the history books to straighten out 
some gigantic poetic license. 
</P>
<P>
The beautifully acted drama contains enough domestic horrors to make Charles 
Dickens rub his hands in glee and to fuel a lifetime of pathos. But 
unaccountably, producer-writer Colin Shindler has played fast and loose with 
the facts in order to give Charlie's music hall singer-father (Ian McShane) a 
longer run and a stronger influence in his son's life. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Sr. wasn't around to see young Charlie or his older half-brother, Syd, 
into long pants, or to perform a little dance for them with his fork and two 
rolls at a swell restaurant. He was dead of drink at the age of 38, when 
Charlie was 5 years old, and actually out of the family's life when little 
Charlie was 1. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that any child today could suggest the young Charlie's talents: 
He literally took over the stage at the age of 5 when his mother faltered in 
her "Irish marching song" and so endeared himself to that rowdy music hall 
audience that they threw coins to him. Young Joe Geary, sturdy throughout, is 
best in the last of these three parts, where he must convince us of 14-year-old 
Charlie's maturity and experience as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
"Young Charlie Chaplin" succeeds best in Twiggy's lovely watercolor sketch of 
Hannah Chaplin, the boys' singer-mother, whose stage name was Lily Harley and 
who would haunt her son's films forever as the exquisite, idealized woman. 
Cockney Twiggy is superb at suggesting the gaiety, the strengths, the tenacity 
of this frail reed, who could not stand the strain of her husband's alcoholism 
and abandonment and was eventually institutionalized. Her moments in their 
basement flat when she creates little dramas from the boots and shoes of 
passers-by above are genuinely affecting, and her songs are lovely. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity, though, that the production settles for hackneyed music ("The Band 
Played On") when Twiggy could have done so much with the real English music 
hall songs of the time. You only have to remember Angela Lansbury, singing and 
pantomiming "Good Bye, Little Yellow Bird" in "The Picture of Dorian Gray," to 
see what wonders could have been. 
</P>
<P>
And, in this hundredth anniversary year of Chaplin's birth, wouldn't it do him 
more honor -- and be closer to the truth -- to allow for the existence of 
genius, inexplicable as that quality is? Instead, young Charlie learns routines 
by watching (bad) slapstick chases in the streets around him. 
</P>
<P>
With all these demurs, there is a delicacy to its performances and a 
willingness to deal with some of the bleaker elements of Chaplin's life and his 
time, that makes "Young Charlie Chaplin" an interesting effort. SHEILA BENSON

NBC'S CONNIE CHUNG MAY RETURN TO CBS

<P>
Less than a week after Diane Sawyer agreed to leave CBS News for ABC, there was 
speculation Friday that Connie Chung is considering leaving NBC to return to 
CBS News, possibly to join a revamped "West 57th." 
</P>
<P>
Chung, whose network career began with CBS in 1972 and who anchored at what now 
is KCBS-TV Channel 2 in Los Angeles from 1976 to 1983, has had discussions with 
CBS, but those were only "exploratory," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
The newswoman, who joined NBC in 1983 and is reportedly paid $900,000 annually, 
was reported on assignment in New Mexico and unavailable for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Chung, whose contract expires in May, reports for "NBC Nightly News" and 
anchors the Saturday edition of the network newscast. 
</P>
<P>
CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman declined to comment on whether his network is 
trying to lure Chung back. JAY SHARBUTT

PARKENING OFFERS SIMPLE GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps it was fitting that guitarist Christopher Parkening closed his recital 
at Ambassador Auditorium Thursday night with a satisfying arrangement of the 
Shaker hymn " 'Tis a Gift to Be Simple." 
</P>
<P>
Although the 12 short works, two suites and eight collaborations with guitarist 
David Brandon aptly demonstrated Parkening's non-aggressive style, mastery over 
a wide range of effects and a prodigiously controlled pianissimo and sul 
ponticello, there were few enterprising efforts. Reading throughout from scores 
placed on a nearby music stand, Parkening opted for works that were either very 
familiar or were simple enough not to require extra rehearsing. 
</P>
<P>
Moreno's "Suite Castillos de Espana" proceeded seamlessly, driving heroically 
to the final "Turegano," while Sor's Variations on a Theme by Mozart showcased 
an impressive array of ornate passages. But a lack of concentration and focus 
marred the performance of a transcription of a suite from Praetorius' 
"Terpsichore." 
</P>
<P>
Other works such as Tarrega's tremolo study "Recuerdos de la Alhambra," two 
preludes and an etude by Villa-Lobos and two short transcriptions of Albeniz 
piano pieces were all mastered with the right amount of control and expression. 
Three selections from Segovia's arrangements of the Bach Cello Suites were less 
convincing and at times even found Parkening struggling with accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Of the works performed with Brandon, the Prelude No. 4 from Mario 
Castelnuovo-Tedesco's "Les Guitares Bien Temperees" (1962) was the evening's 
best example of expressive, lush Romanticism, albeit performed routinely. An 
excessively easy transcription of Two Renaissance Dances From the "Fitzwilliam 
Virginal Book" also provided moments of interest.

Television's February ratings sweeps are always a favored time for movie buffs, 
and this weekend is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
The three networks will battle it out for viewers Sunday night with two new TV 
movies and one of the most popular theatrical releases of all time. NBC 
(4)(36)(39) will trot out reliable Raymond Burr at 9 p.m. in yet another 
installment of "Perry Mason," this one "The Case of the Lethal Lesson." CBS 
(2)(8) counters with Sharon Gless in "The Outside Woman," a true-life story of 
a woman who falls in love with a prison inmate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ABC (7)(3)(10)(42) will reap the benefits of Harrison Ford's 
swashbuckling shenanigans in "Raiders of the Lost Ark." 
</P>
<P>
KTLA Channel 5 will go with a movie lineup of sequels Sunday that includes "The 
Black Stallion Returns" at 6 p.m. and "Pyscho III" at 8 p.m. KHJ-TV Channel 9 
counters with "Under Fire," the 1983 film set in revolutionary Nicaragua that 
stars Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy, at 7 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And KCOP Channel 13 offers up the crown jewel of them all, "Casablanca," 
starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, at 8 p.m. Sunday. STEVE WEINSTEIN

GARDENING: TOMATOES THAT LET YOU GET A JUMP ON EARLY PLANTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam is an avid gardener and writer who resides in Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
April is the traditional month to plant tomatoes in Southland gardens -- 
certainly not February. 
</P>
<P>
However, if you have a gambling spirit, you may be able to enjoy an extremely 
early harvest of tomatoes if you set out the plants this month. Not any plants, 
mind you. Most tomato varieties simply will bide their time -- or worse -- when 
planted this early. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a tomato variety designed to produce early fruit in cool 
weather. It's called Early Girl, and plants are available in local nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
Each February, I plant several plants of Early Girl and with good luck, I have 
fruit by late April -- two months ahead of the normal harvest. 
</P>
<P>
The reason that Early Girl produces fruit so early is that it has the ability 
to set fruit at lower temperatures than most other tomato varieties. Most 
tomato plants won't set fruit if the nighttime temperature falls below 55 
degrees Fahrenheit. Early Girl will set fruit under considerably lower 
temperature conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Early Girl produces a medium-size, good-tasting tomato at a period of time when 
the only other tomatoes available are those bland, tasteless rocks from the 
supermarket. The fruit is produced on large, sprawling vines that require 
caging or staking. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, by planting in February you run the risk of losing the plants to an 
unseasonable frost. However, in many coastal areas of Southern California, a 
hard frost this late is unlikely. I've never lost a tomato plant to frost in 
February. Foothill and Inland Valley gardeners, some of whom experienced snow 
last week, should probably wait until March to try this early tomato variety. 
</P>
<P>
Early Girl has the same growing requirements as other tomato plants. Choose an 
area of the garden that receives at least seven hours of sun daily -- the more 
the better. Work generous quantities of organic material into the soil. If the 
soil tends to be alkaline, as much of the soil in the Southland is, peat moss 
is a valuable organic addition. When working the soil, add a vegetable 
fertilizer, following label instructions as to amount. Water the soil 
thoroughly and allow it to settle for two days before planting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recovery Time 
</P>
<P>
Transplant the young plants into the garden in late afternoon when they will 
have the cool of the evening to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Remove the plants from the container, leaving an equal amount of soil and root 
system on each plant. Planting holes should be 2 to 3 feet apart and should be 
deep, with the plants set at a deeper level than they were in the container. 
Remove the lower leaves along the stem and bury the plant to within 2 to 3 
inches of its topmost foliage. 
</P>
<P>
During the transplanting process, water the plants gently with a sprinkling 
can. For the first five days after transplanting, give the plants a light 
watering once a day. 
</P>
<P>
When young plants are established, water deeply on a weekly basis (tomatoes 
grown in containers need far more frequent watering). After the plants begin to 
set fruit, it will pay to sprinkle some vegetable fertilizer around them on a 
monthly basis. Always water thoroughly after fertilizing. 
</P>
<P>
Spreading black plastic mulch between plants eliminates weeding and speeds up 
growth. Always put drainage slits in the plastic so water can get through. 
Control those tomato worms by using Dipel, Attack or Thuricide, which are 
biological controls that are not harmful to beneficial insects. Spray every 10 
days and follow the label instructions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to early tomatoes, February presents an interesting month in the 
vegetable garden. It is the last practical month to plant the bare-root 
vegetables: artichokes, asparagus, rhubarb and horseradish. It is the best 
month of the year to plant all lettuce types, except head lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
There is a wide selection of strawberry plants in local nurseries this month. 
February is the best month to plant potatoes from seed potatoes in our area. 
Many gardeners are enjoying growing some of the more unusual potatoes such as 
Yellow Finn, Peruvian Blue and Yellow Fingerling, all of which have recently 
become available as seed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others to Plant 
</P>
<P>
Other vegetables to plant this month include beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, 
celery, endive, kale, kohlrabi, leeks, onions, parsnips, peas, radishes, 
salsify, spinach, Swiss chard and turnips. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, some nurseries will have pepper plants for sale this month. Avoid 
them. April is the earliest to successfully set out pepper plants. If planted 
now, they will simply sulk and experience almost no growth until the weather 
warms up. The growth of the plants will be greatly retarded and they will never 
reach their potential.

'HUG A RAIDER' BENEFIT MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK RORABACK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's "Hug a Raider Day" on Monday, and from all reports, the players lever as 
much grade-A gusto into the embrace as they do into a football game; maybe 
more, considering their 1988 record. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of a hug, plus an autographed photo, is $1, proceeds to the America Heart 
Assn., and association spokewoman Nann Miller virtually guarantees value. 
"They'll hug you as long as you want," says Miller, veteran of all seven 
previous fund-raisers. "You'll get your dollar's worth and then some." 
</P>
<P>
Raiders represented will be Stefon Adams, Vance Mueller, Jerry Robinson, John 
Gesek and Reggie McKenzie, while five Raiderettes will be on hand to 
accommodate those males not entirely enamored of hugging a football player. 
</P>
<P>
Raiderettes will be in uniform, Raiders in "full hugging gear, which generally 
means sweats," Miller says. "Football pads tend to hamper the maneuver. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Time is 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Place is the Garden Level of the Broadway Plaza, 
750 W. 7th St. (at Hope Street). 
</P>
<P>
"Try it, you'll like it," Miller says. "They really put a lot of, uh, Raider 
into it!" DICK RORABACK

DAY HIKE: CHEESEBORO CANYON: GET THERE BEFORE BULLDOZERS DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's the old California of the ranchos: oak-studded potreros, rolling foothills 
that glow amber in the dry months, emerald green in springtime. It's not hard 
to imagine vaqueros rounding up tough Mexican range cattle. 
</P>
<P>
But today, this last vestige of old California, a canyon called Cheeseboro, 
faces an uncertain future. Though partially protected by the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area, part of the canyon and much of the 
surrounding countryside may go the way of the ranchos; that is to say -- sold, 
subdivided and paved over. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and the Los Angeles County Department of 
Public Works are considering the construction of a four-lane boulevard in the 
lower reaches of Cheeseboro Canyon. A developer wants to build a suburb and a 
golf course on land bordering the park. If pro-development forces have their 
way, the last wildlife corridor connecting the Santa Monica Mountains to the 
open lands of the north will become part of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. If 
subdividers are successful, this little bit of parkland perched on the western 
rim of the San Fernando Valley will soon be an island facing the tidal wave of 
development sweeping the Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
When walking beneath a canopy of oak and sycamore in the bottom of Cheeseboro 
Canyon, it's possible to leave people and politics far behind and enjoy this 
Southern California of old. But ascending the canyon's north wall on the 
Modello Trail brings you to a confrontation with modernity -- the sight of 
bulldozers making molehills out of mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Cheeseboro Canyon -- for now -- is a pleasant walk, gentle enough for the whole 
family. Weekdays it's an especially tranquil locale. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to the trailhead: From the Ventura Freeway in Agoura, exit north on 
Chesebro Road. Loop inland very briefly on Palo Comado Canyon Road, then turn 
right on Chesebro Road, which leads to the National Park Service's gravel 
entrance road and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Note your return route, Modello Trail, snaking north up the wall of 
the canyon, but follow the fire road east into Cheeseboro Canyon. The fire road 
soon swings north and dips into the canyon. You'll pass a signed intersection 
with Canyon Overlook Trail, a less-than-thrilling side trail that leads to a 
knoll overlooking the Lost Hills landfill. 
</P>
<P>
After this junction, the main canyon trail, now known as Sulfur Springs Trail, 
winds through valley oak-dotted (Quercus lobata) grassland and coast live 
oak-lined (Quercus agrifolia) canyon. Watch for mule deer browsing in the 
meadows and a multitude of squirrels scurrying among the oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The old road crisscrosses an (usually) all-but-dry stream bed. About 3 miles 
from the trailhead, your nose will tell you that you've arrived at Sulfur 
Springs. You can turn around here or continue another 1 3/4 miles up a 
narrowing trail and canyon to an old sheep corral. 
</P>
<P>
Return the way you came on Sulfur Springs Trail to a junction three-fourths of 
a mile from the trailhead. Join signed Modello Trail, which ascends the west 
wall of the canyon. From the ridge top you can get a good view of Cheeseboro 
Canyon and can ponder the future of what is one of the finest remaining oak 
woodlands in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
At a signed junction, stay with Modello Trail, which loops around the head of a 
ravine, then descends to the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
A map highlighting the trails and natural features of Cheeseboro Canyon is 
available. For a copy, send a business-size, self-addressed stamped envelope 
to: Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, Attn: Cheeseboro Map,

This time there was no dramatic rally to lift Fullerton High School past the 
odds and the opposition in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fell behind Sunny Hills and stayed behind in a Freeway League boys' 
basketball game Friday night at Sunny Hills and lost, 56-52. 
</P>
<P>
The loss cost Fullerton a chance at winning the league title outright. Instead, 
Fullerton and Sunny Hills will share the league title with 9-1 records. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills (17-7 overall) won a coin flip Friday and will advance to the 
Southern Section 4-AA playoffs, which begin next week, as the league's No. 1 
representative. Fullerton (16-6) advances to the 4-A playoffs as the league's 
No. 2 team. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills took the lead early in the first quarter and never trailed 
thereafter. The Lancers clung to a five- to eight-point lead, but it hardly 
seemed safe, particularly in light of Fullerton's string of come-from-behind 
victories this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton rallied from a 21-point deficit to win Wednesday night over Sonora. A 
week ago, the Indians trailed La Habra by nine points with 2:28 left, but 
rallied to win. They've also rallied from 20, 11 and 14 and still won this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a stab at it again Friday, but fell short. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians trailed, 55-49, with less than a minute to play, and three-pointers 
by Rene Arias and Pete Bach brought them within, 55-52, with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fouled Sunny Hills guard Jon Beuerlein, but he made one of two free 
throws with 2 seconds left to ice the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bach had a game-high 26 points, but was the only Fullerton player to score in 
double figures. Beuerlein and Jeff White had 14 apiece and Marcus Hopkins 10 
for Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a great game," Sunny Hills Coach Steve White said. "That's the way 
these championship games should be played." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most of the game was played at a frenzied pace. There were three 
technical fouls called. The Fullerton mascot got the first one for running onto 
the court after Sunny Hills was preparing to inbound the ball after a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
The second was charged to the Sunny Hills bench, but credit goes to the 
Lancers' student section for throwing debris on the court. The third went to 
Fullerton Coach Chris Burton for arguing a call late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 81, Troy 62 -- David Stevens scored 20 points to lead the Highlanders 
(12-11, 6-4) at La Habra. John Lowe scored 23 points for Troy (6-16, 2-8). La 
Habra advances to the 4-A playoffs as the league's No. 3 team.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY TIES UP LEAGUE RACE WITH COMEBACK

<P>
Fountain Valley High School scored eight consecutive points in the final 2 
minutes of play to defeat Huntington Beach, 72-64, Friday and create a 
three-way tie for the Sunset League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Huntington Beach, Ocean View and Edison are the co-champions 
of the six-team league with 7-3 records. Edison will advance to the Southern 
Section 5-A playoffs as the league's No. 1 entry, followed by Huntington Beach 
(No. 2, 5-AA playoffs) and Ocean View (No. 3, 5-A). 
</P>
<P>
School administrators used a coin flip to determine the team's designations for 
the playoffs that begin Wednesday. Edison earned the top designation when Coach 
Jon Borchert was the odd man among the trio of coaches in a three-way coin 
flip. 
</P>
<P>
Then, another coin flip was used to determine the No. 2 and No. 3 bids. Jim 
Harris, Ocean View coach, called "heads" and Huntington Beach got the second 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
"We play two and a half months and then decide things by flipping a quarter," 
said Roy Miller, Huntington Beach coach. "At worst, I saw us losing the game, 
losing the flips and having to play Saddleback or Mater Dei on the round in the 
first round." 
</P>
<P>
Edison (14-12, 7-3) is guaranteed a home game in the first round.Ocean View 
(17-7, 7-3) is guaranteed a road game by losing the flip. Pairings will be 
announced Sunday at the Southern Section office in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Huntington Beach (12-11, 7-3) could have avoided the suspense by 
winning its season finale against Fountain Valley and claiming its first league 
title since 1985 outright. 
</P>
<P>
But Fountain Valley (18-6, 6-4) outplayed Huntington Beach in the second half 
and gained some much-needed momentum going into the playoffs after losing four 
of its last five games before beating the Oilers. Fountain Valley is expected 
to gain an at-large entry into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cook and Doug Weaver, the standout receivers on Fountain Valley's Division 
I championship football team, played big roles on the basketball court. Weaver 
made four three-point shots and finished with 16 points. Fountain Valley made 
seven three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Cook had 12 rebounds and scored nine points, including a breakaway layup with 
29 seconds remaining to push Fountain Valley ahead, 70-64. Center Mike Merli 
added 18 points in what Coach Dave Brown called his best game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good win in a big-time game," Brown said. "We've shown the ability 
to come back all year long and did it again tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach was cruising with a seven-point lead in the second quarter but 
the Oilers also had three starters with three fouls each. Fountain Valley 
trimmed the deficit to a point, 33-32, at halftime, and Merli gave the Barons 
their first lead to open the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to put them away in the first half, but they got back in it 
and that was the key to the game," Miller said. "We didn't contain their inside 
game, and they shot a lot better than the first time we played them." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jeff Long led Huntington Beach with 21 points and scored 14 of the 
Oilers' 31 points in the second half before fouling out. 
</P>
<P>
Edison 62, Westminster 36 -- Art Baird scored 14 points and Tom Tyler and Brian 
Murphy each added 10 points as Edison (14-12, 7-3) earned a share of the league 
championship.

EL DORADO WINS 14TH GAME IN ROW

<P>
There was plenty of incentive for El Dorado and Cypress high schools Friday 
night in their Empire League boys' basketball finale. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado, which already had clinched the league title, had an opportunity to 
close out the regular season with a 14-game winning streak and enter the 
Southern Section 3-A playoffs with a perfect league record. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress had a chance to avenge a defeat earlier in the season to El Dorado 
before heading into the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks remained perfect in league play, 60-57. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we're playing well," El Dorado Coach Wayne Carlson. El Dorado is 
20-4 overall, 10-0 in league play, the first El Dorado team to go undefeated in 
league competition. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress (11-13, 6-4) and Los Alamitos tied for second in league play. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if the Centurions might claim second place outright for nearly 
three quarters. They led, 19-18, lead on a Mark Johnson basket with 47 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter. Johnson led Cypress with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress built an eight-point lead, 45-37, in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions held leading scorer and rebounder Matt Luke and starting guard 
Mike Renaud to three points each in the second and third quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But they couldn't contain either in the final quarter, when the Hawks outscored 
Cypress, 16-7, to escape with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Renaud led the Hawks' balanced scoring attack with 15 points, including nine in 
the final 8 minutes. Luke finished with 12 points, 21 rebounds and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks trailed, 50-46, going into the final quarter, but Luke sank two free 
throws and tipped in a Jerome Facione miss with 7:17 left to get the Hawks to 
within a basket at 50-48. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 4 minutes Luke had three steals, the second of which led to a 
Renaud basket at 2:57 that tied the score at 54-54. Another Luke steal with 
1:36 remaining led to two Renaud free throws and El Dorado's first lead of the 
game since the first quarter at 56-54. 
</P>
<P>
One of Luke's biggest rebounds came after a miss with 50 seconds to go by Jared 
Rice, who had 19 points. Mike Bradach was fouled and sank both shots for a 
58-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Katella 64, Los Alamitos 56 -- Brian Yourstone scored 25 points to lead the 
Knights (7-15, 3-7) at Katella. The Knights outscored the Griffins, 19-11, in 
the fourth quarter to pull away for the victory. Mike Wilson scored 17 points 
and Robert Conlisk 14 for Los Alamitos (11-14, 6-4), which enters the 5-A 
playoffs.

OCEAN VIEW SHUTS DOWN PARKS AND MARINA

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ocean View High School boys' basketball team had a simple game plan Friday 
night against Marina: Stop 6-foot-10 center Cherokee Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks did just that, limiting Parks to only 14 points en route to an 
71-41 Sunset League victory in front of 2,000 at Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moves Ocean View (17-8 overall, 7-3 in league) into a first-place 
tie with Huntington Beach and Edison in the league standings. League coaches 
flipped a coin late Friday night to decide the three teams' seedings. Edison 
will be the top-seeded team, followed by Huntington Beach and Ocean View. 
Marina ends its season at 10-15, 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew if Parks got going he would be impossible to stop, " Ocean View Coach 
Jim Harris said. "Todd Norman did an outstanding job keeping him away from the 
basket tonight and that made a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View also used a effective full-court pressure defense that forced 23 
Marina turnovers, which led to several baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks opened a 41-23 halftime lead and increased it to 71-35 with less 
than five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Norman led all scorers with 19 points and 10 rebounds and teammate Mike Frohn 
added 17. Thi Nguyen had 11 points for Marina.

WOODBRIDGE UPSETS TRABUCO HILLS, 78-68

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior forward Joe Cohen scored 21 points to lead Woodbridge High School to a 
78-68 victory over Trabuco Hills Friday in a Pacific Coast League boys' 
basketball game at Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (17-6, 9-1) had clinched the league championship last week but 
missed a chance for an undefeated league season. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Shanklin came off the bench to score 17, and Tim Corkin had 11 for 
Woodbridge (9-11, 7-3), which tied for second with Laguna Hills. Woodbridge 
gets the second seed out of the league because it beat the league champion. 
Woodbridge was 30 of 43 from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
In other Pacific Coast League games: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 55, Costa Mesa 51 (OT) -- Dain Blanton scored 22 points, including 
four free throws in the final minute of overtime, to lead the Artists (10-12, 
4-6) at Costa Mesa. Tim Nguyen scored 25 points for Costa Mesa (3-17, 2-8). 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 82, Orange 71 -- Pat Nelson scored 26 points to lead the Hawks 
(15-8, 7-3) at Laguna Hills. The score was tied, 17-17, at the end of the first 
quarter, but Laguna Hills outscored the Panthers, 25-9, in the second to take a 
42-26 halftime lead. Nelson scored eight points in the second quarter and Chris 
Sheff seven. Sheff finished with 16 points.

SANTA ANA BOYS WIN IN THE FINAL MINUTE TO CLINCH LEAGUE TITLE

Freshman Gabriel Ballesteros scored with less than a minute to play, giving 
Santa Ana High School a 2-1 victory over Canyon and the Century League boys' 
soccer championship Friday at Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Rangel set up the shot with a soft pass that got through a maze of 
players in the penalty area, and Ballesteros grounded the ball past goalie 
Chris Snitko. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (15-3-5 overall, 5-1-4 in league play) was the defending league champion 
and had not lost in its 19 previous league games. The Comanches last lost a 
league contest on Feb. 7, 1987, when they were defeated by Santa Ana, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always tough when you lose in the final minute, but I must say that Santa 
Ana is the better team this season," said Walt Bowman, Canyon's coach. "We were 
lucky to be tied 1-1 late in the game because they had three shots that went 
off the goal post, including one penalty shot. But still, they had the better 
team and they deserved to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (17-1-6, 6-0-3), which was ranked second to Mission Viejo among 
Southern Section 3-A schools, took a 1-0 lead with 14 minutes left in the first 
half when Eddie Buenrostro took a pass from Marco Silva and lined a shot past 
Snitko for his eighth goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which didn't have a shot on goal in the first half, tied the score 
early in the second half when Greg Lawrence won a scramble in front of the 
Saint net and kicked a grounder past Santa Ana goalie Hector Ramos. AL PRESTON

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
THIS TIME, FULLERTON COMES BACK TO DEFEAT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time the Cal State Fullerton baseball team played Stanford was in the 
Titans' final game of the College World Series last June. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford eliminated Fullerton, and Stanford won the title. 
</P>
<P>
So as young as this season is, when Stanford came to Titan Field Friday, 
Fullerton had something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans got a small measure of revenge, taking a 3-2 victory when Trevor 
Neighbors' single in the seventh inning took a bad hop and stuck in the 
dew-dampened infield near second base, allowing Eddie Lample to score from 
third. Fullerton (2-1) had come back to tie the score in the inning after 
trailing, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton second baseman Mate Borgogno and shortstop Randy Graves both singled 
to lead off the inning. Next up was Lample, playing for catcher Brent Mayne, 
who missed a second game in a row because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
Lample bunted, intending to sacrifice, but pitcher Stan Spencer fielded the 
bunt and threw to third, too late to get Borgogno. Third baseman Tim Griffin 
then threw to first, but the throw was wild, and the error allowed two runs to 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Lample stopped at third. Scott Weiss relieved Spencer, and hit Jones with a 
pitch, putting runners at first and third. Neighbors then singled, with Lample 
scoring. Weiss retired the next three batters to get out of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton starter Danny DeVille had a two-hit shutout going through the first 
six innings, but ended without a decision. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh, David Holbrook reached on a throwing error by 
third baseman Ralph Ramirez. DeVille struck out Eric Cox for the second out, 
but Brian Johnson beat out a grounder to short to put runners on first and 
second. Stanford loaded the bases when DeVille walked Eric DeGraw. 
</P>
<P>
That brought up Frank Carey, the leadoff hitter. Carey, who is batting .414, 
lined a 3-1 pitch into center field, too shallow for Bobby Jones to attempt a 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hollis, running for Holbrook, scored easily, and Johnson beat Jones' 
throw, which was shallow and off to the right. 
</P>
<P>
The runners went to second and third on the throw, and Roger Burnett walked to 
load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
But Chris Robinson came on and got Troy Paulsen to ground out, ending the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who allowed one hit in 2 1/3 innings, striking out four, earned his 
second victory without a loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer (0-1) took the loss, allowing one earned run on seven hits. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford loaded the bases with two out in the eighth, but Robinson struck out 
DeGraw, holding off the Cardinal (4-4). 
</P>
<P>
In other nonconference games: 
</P>
<P>
UC Riverside 8, UC Irvine 3 -- Riverside (2-4) scored four runs in the first 
inning and two in the fourth at Irvine. Brian Young had two hits and two RBIs 
for Irvine (1-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach 17, Chapman 1 -- Todd Guggiana had three hits and two RBIs 
to lead the 49ers (6-0) at Long Beach. Jason Rolish had an RBI for Chapman 
(3-5). 
</P>
<P>
Southern California 14, Occidental 0 -- Denny Berni had two hits and four RBIs 
to lead host SCC (2-1).

HAVE YOU HAD AN ABORTION? WOULD YOU? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject comes up every year about this time, after the anniversary of the 
U.S. Supreme Court's controversial 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing 
abortion. But with a more conservative court and President Bush's anti-abortion 
stand, the air is even more charged this time around. Tell us how Roe vs. Wade 
affected your life. If you've had an abortion, legal or illegal, do you regret 
it now? Which side of the controversy are you on, and why?

When a Child Isn't Perfect 
</P>
<P>
They call them "special" children, those with mental retardation, autism, spina 
bifida or other disabilities that set them apart from "normal" kids. If there's 
a "special" child in your family, tell us how you've adjusted to the reality, 
and how you cope with the fact that your child may never become independent.

FAMILY LIFE: GETTING THE MOST OUT OF A GOOD FAMILY FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN , Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
"You slob! 
</P>
<P>
"You left your socks on the floor again! What do you think I am, your personal 
maid? Your mother was a total failure when it came to raising you!" 
</P>
<P>
(Family Life this week is eavesdropping on the Joneses, a hypothetical, but not 
necessarily typical, Orange County family. They are showing us the wrong way to 
have a family fight. Now, let's get back to the action. Mary Jones is 
continuing her assault on her husband, John.) 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I found out long ago just how irresponsible and unreliable you are. 
Remember that Saturday night 12 years ago when you just had to go out with the 
boys, no matter how much it hurt me? We had only been married a month, but you 
didn't care. You don't care about anything, do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 (At first, John refuses to be dragged in. He struggles to keep his attention 
focused on the television. But the pressure builds, and by the next commercial, 
he's ready to launch his counterattack, interrupting Mary in mid-sentence.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You're calling me a slob? Look in the mirror, tubby! Or have you looked in 
your car lately? It's like a rolling trash can! And it wouldn't even be rolling 
if it weren't for me. You don't even know how to check your oil, let alone 
change it! I have to be responsible for everything in this family!" 
</P>
<P>
 (Uh-oh. Nine-year-old Billy has just entered the room to ask a question.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I ride my bike down to the park?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," says his father, who has turned his attention back to the TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute," Mary says. "Is your room clean?" Billy looks down at his shoes 
and shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you can't go until it is." 
</P>
<P>
"But Dad said . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Dad doesn't know what he's talking about. He hasn't even picked up his socks. 
I can see where you get your sloppy tendencies." 
</P>
<P>
"You want 'em picked up?" John shouts. "No problem. Catch! You want my shoes 
too?" he asks, hurling a sneaker in Mary's direction. Then he walks out of the 
room, slamming the door behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Joining us now are our commentators, psychologists Marvin Rofsky of Orange, 
Rosalyn Laudati of Brea, Charles Browning of Los Alamitos and Don Steckdaub of 
Anaheim Hills. In their work with couples and families, they've seen more 
fights than Howard Cosell. Our fictional family fight was based on their 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, let's put this in perspective. Fighting is an essential part of 
family interaction, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely, Rofsky says. "People who don't fight probably don't communicate. If 
a couple comes in and tells me how wonderful things are between them because 
they never fight, I'm very suspicious that there is real avoidance between 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Laudati agrees. The problem, she says, is that too many of us don't know how to 
fight. "The people I see are usually really terrible at it," she says. "That's 
one of the things I have to teach people right off the bat." 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, Steckdaub says, fighting skills are lacking because "more often 
than not, at least one member has been raised in a dysfunctional family and 
never learned the skills of intimacy, of healthy give and take. Their parents 
did the best job they could, but too often it was not a very good job. They 
learned so much garbage that was just untrue and inappropriate." Steckdaub, by 
the way, prefers the term "disagreement" when referring to a healthy fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's possible to bring something worthwhile and meaningful out of fights," 
Browning says. "Look at the example of the oyster. It can take a small irritant 
such as a grain of sand and turn it into something beautiful and valuable -- a 
pearl." 
</P>
<P>
Let's roll the instant replay now and see what the Joneses could have done to 
make their fight constructive instead of destructive. Mary made the first 
mistake in the way she initiated the fight. "You need to get control of 
negative, angry thoughts and make up your mind that you are not going to 
attack, raise your voice, whine, complain or label the other person," Browning 
says. 
</P>
<P>
But didn't John start the fight by leaving his socks on the floor in the first 
place? No, because there is nothing inherently wrong with doing that. The socks 
didn't bother him. But they did bother Mary. 
</P>
<P>
Name-calling -- "You slob!" -- is definitely against the rules, all our experts 
agree. And Mary's complaint would have come across more effectively if she had 
begun her sentences not with the word "you" but with "I." That way, "you're 
talking about your feelings, not making accusations," Rofsky says. 
</P>
<P>
"Never blame or use the word 'you,' " Browning says. "The words 'you,' 'always' 
and 'never' are poison. Cut them out of your vocabulary. Instead of pointing 
the finger at the other person, point it at yourself and talk about what you 
want and need." 
</P>
<P>
Rofsky would have Mary saying something like this: "I'm upset that I'm left 
with the responsibility for picking up your socks." (You're right, it doesn't 
sound nearly as interesting that way. But we're not writing a sitcom here.) 
</P>
<P>
The remark about the maid may have been cute, but it was pointless, and our 
experts say it's imperative not to stray from the facts at hand. But if Mary 
had to say it, she should have said, "Sometimes I feel like your personal 
maid." 
</P>
<P>
Mary also shouldn't have dragged John's mother into it, the psychologists say. 
Nor should she have brought up something that happened 12 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't bring up old garbage," Laudati says. "Stick to the topic at hand." 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly all dysfunctional families are totally preoccupied with what happened 
in the past," Steckdaub says. "Today (has) plenty of issues to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, focus on the future, Browning suggests. "Instead of talking about all 
the other person did wrong yesterday, talk about how good it will be when you 
both can do it better tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
John's initial reaction -- stonewalling -- is a common one for men, Browning 
says. "Some fights turn into World War III because one person, usually the man, 
refuses to talk and withdraws into silence. This leaves the partner 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, John should have acknowledged Mary's feelings, at least to the point 
of saying, "Listen, I know you really need to talk, but right now I'm tired. 
Let's talk tonight after dinner at 8." 
</P>
<P>
Fighting by appointment can be a good idea, Rofsky says. "Both parties get to 
review what they want to say, and that helps them deal with the specific issue 
rather than the personalities." 
</P>
<P>
John interrupted Mary's tirade, and Laudati says that's a big mistake. "Never 
interrupt. Learn to keep your mouth shut until the other person is finished." 
</P>
<P>
Browning puts it another way. "God gave you one mouth and two ears. Use them in 
that proportion." 
</P>
<P>
John became defensive, another no-no, and he called his wife "tubby," referring 
to the fact that she is hardly a candidate for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit 
issue. That's a foul, Laudati says. "If you know somebody is sensitive about 
something, never, ever bring it up in a fight." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks about the car had nothing to do with socks, but "I" statements 
would have helped if he wanted to bring them up another time. 
</P>
<P>
Mary made another mistake when Billy became involved, Rofsky says. Although he 
sees no harm in arguing in front of the children, he says that "the only thing 
you don't fight in front of the kids about is the kids." Even if she disagreed 
with her husband's decision, Mary should have stuck by it. 
</P>
<P>
But Laudati disagrees strongly. "When parents fight in front of their children, 
it gives them a feeling of insecurity and fears of the family breaking up. 
Children should see the parents disagree in a healthy way, but if it starts 
escalating, you should excuse yourselves and go to another room." 
</P>
<P>
John also goofed when he started throwing things. That can be a precursor to 
physical violence, our experts say, and is therefore definitely off limits. So 
is threatening physical violence, Steckdaub says. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, John and Mary need to make up. To do that right, they need to be 
willing to let the other person have the last word. Laudati says, "You can say, 
'I don't agree with you, but you have the last word.' " 
</P>
<P>
And it doesn't matter who wins. "Marriage has to be more about cooperation than 
competition," Laudati says.

BOOKENDS: SLOW, STEADY KOONTZ IS SUDDENLY ON TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that he's made it to the top of the nation's premiere best seller list, 
Dean R. Koontz can think about retiring his reputation for being "the 
least-known best-selling author in America." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Koontz's new novel, "Midnight," soared to the No. 1 spot on the New 
York Times best seller list. The mainstream thriller had entered the list only 
the week before -- and that was based on just 3 days of sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We were astonished," said Koontz, 43, who lives with his wife, Gerda, in the 
hills east of Orange. "I've been jumping up and down so much my ankle joints 
are beginning to give out, but it's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
"Midnight" has also hit the No. 1 spots on the Los Angeles Times and 
Publisher's Weekly best seller lists and, according to Koontz, just about every 
other list in the country. The highest position Koontz had ever reached on the 
New York Times list came in 1988 when his thriller "Lightning" rose to No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz said his phone hasn't stopped ringing since Sunday's New York Times hit 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like I've heard from everyone I ever worked with in publishing all 
these years," said Koontz, who began publishing in 1969. "When someone has been 
around a long time and makes it to this degree, it seems to please people in 
the industry because current wisdom is that you have to make it quick and fast 
with a lot of hype. Making it slow by writing better books and improving your 
skills over a lot of years is an old-fashioned approach and it gives editors 
who love books the feeling that the book itself actually matters, not just the 
hype." 
</P>
<P>
As has been his policy in the past, Koontz said he has been avoiding doing 
publicity for "Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
"I told Putnam I couldn't do anything for this book because I'm desperately 
trying to finish the next one. I have no time for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, despite his best seller status since 1981, the author of "Whispers" 
and "Strangers" has never done an author tour and has largely avoided the 
national media, particularly television, to promote his books. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, I'm always working on something else, and that's more exciting to me 
than going out and pitching books," he said, adding that he'd also like to 
retain as much anonymity as possible. A writer, he said, "is an observer, and 
if you're aware of other people watching you, it's harder to watch them." 
</P>
<P>
The best-selling "master of menace" is, after all, one low-key kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
The day he and Gerda heard "Midnight" had gone to top of the New York Times 
best seller list, Koontz decided to celebrate by doing something 
"self-indulgent" and going out for a celebratory dinner afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ended up buying was a sport coat," he said with a laugh. "And we went 
out and had salad for dinner. We're going to have to work real hard on being 
self-indulgent and celebrating." 
</P>
<P>
Mystery Writer: Elizabeth George of Huntington Beach said she was thrilled to 
learn last week that her 1988 British detective novel, "A Great Deliverance," 
has been nominated by Mystery Writers of America for its "best first novel" 
award. The novel, published by Bantam Books, was among five books nominated 
nationally. The winner will be announced at an awards dinner in New York on May 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Opera Star: Dame Joan Sutherland will sign copies of her record albums at 
Rizzoli's Book Store in South Coast Plaza from 2 to 3 p.m. Sunday. Sutherland, 
who is appearing in Opera Pacific's production of "Norma" at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, will be accompanied by her husband, maestro Richard 
Bonynge. 
</P>
<P>
Readers Theater: Steve Mellow's Readers' Theater will be presented at 3 p.m. 
Sunday at the Elan Gallery in Laguna Beach, 1145 S. Coast Highway. In the 
spirit of the opening of a new one-man exhibition by French satirist Francis 
Meyrier, the readings will be from French and English satirical writings. 
</P>
<P>
Mellow's Readers' Theater also will be presented at 7:30 p.m. Friday at 
Scribner Book Store in Crystal Court at South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. The 
readings will be from modern story tellers: Jeffrey Archer, T.C. Boyle, Harlan 
Ellison, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Barry Yourgrau. pichar 
</P>
<P>
Humbug Witch: Lorna Balian, author of "Humbug Witch" and "Humbug Rabbit" will 
sign copies of her books from 10 a.m. to noon Tuesday at the Children's 
Bookshoppe, 1831 Westcliff Drive, Newport Beach. DENNIS McLELLAN

ON THE WATERFRONT: PACIFICA'S PRESIDENT, LIKE THE YACHTS SHE BUILDS, IS 1 OF A 
KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wanda Kipper, fashion-model thin and casually stylish, looks like she stepped 
out of the pages of a yachting magazine. Her hair, makeup and manner suggest 
someone who would be more at home sailing a fancy yacht than building one. 
</P>
<P>
But appearances are deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
As owner and president of Pacifica by Kipper Yachts in Costa Mesa, Wanda Kipper 
is the country's only woman to head a major boat-building company. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica, which builds 36- to 77-foot sportfishing yachts that sell anywhere 
from $250,000 to $2.5 million each, caters to what Kipper calls "macho 
fishermen" who want big, fast powerboats that will take them all the way from 
Orange County to Cabo San Lucas and back without any problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kipper, who prefers not to reveal her age but says "I'm younger than President 
Reagan," has been running the business since 1982 when her husband, Stuart, 
died of cancer. There was never any question about whether she would keep the 
boat-building business, which the Kippers had purchased in 1970 and had run 
jointly. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not consider selling it," says Kipper, who managed the office, ordered 
parts, kept track of inventory and designed the interiors of the yachts. Her 
husband designed the boats and supervised construction. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Wanda Kipper still runs the office, orders parts, keeps track of 
inventory and designs the yachts' interiors. In addition, she sells boats, 
works boat shows and produces the company's ads. General Manager Bob Gunderson, 
Wanda Kipper's son by an earlier marriage, supervises production of the 
limited-edition yachts, which are built in Costa Mesa and Panama City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"Stu and I started the business together . . . and always ran it together," 
says the diminutive and soft-spoken Kipper. He was in his late 40s and had 
taken an early retirement as a problem solver/inventor for a company in Los 
Angeles. She was a former artist with Walt Disney Studios and ran her own 
commercial art business in Glendale.

Both were boaters, so after they both retired, they moved to Hawaii, where they 
started a charter boat business. "We were back here looking for a better boat 
for charter when we came to Pacifica Marine and Stu asked them to build him a 
boat -- the way he wanted it built. The owners of the company said they 
couldn't build it that way and said to Stu, 'Why don't you buy the company and 
build it yourself?' Stu said, 'OK.' So, we bought the business and moved back 
to California," Kipper recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Kippers took over, Pacifica has produced 135 yachts, and Wanda Kipper 
can tell you exactly where each one is. Many of the owners are among the 
country's wealthiest individuals, she says. "And I felt flattered when they 
chose a Pacifica. They could afford any boat they want, and they chose ours." 
</P>
<P>
The walls of her unpretentious Costa Mesa office are lined with photos of 
Pacifica and their happy owners, most of whom -- like Wanda Kipper herself -- 
are ardent fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Kipper, daughter of a commercial fisherman, has been an angler most of her life 
and has been boating as long as she can remember. "I have two brothers who are 
commercial fishermen in Alaska," she says proudly. "And two nieces who are 
commercial fishermen. One does it part time and the other does it full time. 
They've been fishing since they were 8 or 9." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Kipper, who fishes frequently in the waters between Orange County and 
Catalina, single-handedly staged a benefit marlin fishing tournament that 
attracted 34 boats and raised $17,000 for the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
Kipper, who had watched her husband die of cancer, wanted to do her part in 
helping find a cure for the disease. "I felt that if everyone in the U.S. did 
something to help find a cure, then we would succeed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the West Coast Marlin Shoot-Out, as the tournament has come to be 
known, has become an annual benefit for the Orange County unit of the American 
Cancer Society. For the first 3 years Kipper ran the tournament alone. "Then 
each year we began to get more and more sponsors," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Kipper serves on the tournament committee and is still a driving force 
behind the event. Committee meetings are already under way for the 1989 
tournament, planned for August. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I am doing push-ups to build up my arm muscles for fishing," Kipper 
says. "In the next tournament I want to go out with an all-woman team." 
</P>
<P>
Kipper is proud of the fact that, in the interest of conservation, the 
tournament has become a "tag-and-release" competition in which all fish are 
released unharmed after a hook-up has been officially recorded. 
</P>
<P>
Talking about the tournament as she walks through the cluttered boatyard, past 
the machine and electrical shops, Kipper, meticulous as ever, looks out of 
place -- like the proud mother who has stopped by to visit her son at work. 
</P>
<P>
But as she reaches the gigantic hull of the 44-foot Pacifica currently under 
construction, she does not hesitate to climb the rickety ladder 10 feet up so 
that she can inspect the interior of the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Her willingness to become involved in every aspect of the boat-building process 
has served her well, Kipper says. And her fishing and boating expertise has 
made it easy being a female boat-builder in the male-dominated world of 
sportfishing, she insists. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a woman in this business has never been a problem as far as the boat 
owners are concerned," she says. "The only problem I may have had (as a woman) 
was getting revolving credit. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as the boat buyers go, they know we build top-of-the-line boats," 
she says. "And when people talk to me, they know that I understand what they 
are talking about. For example, when they ask me how much fuel a boat uses, I 
make it my business to know." 
</P>
<P>
Later, standing in the boatyard with the huge hull of the Pacifica 44 towering 
behind her, Kipper smiles and says: "I love this business. I love boats." 
</P>

RALLY EARNS CAMARILLO SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Camarillo High has won its half of the Marmonte League title, is it 
too late to start asking questions about these guys? 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere, an "inquiry" light is still flashing after the Scorpions' 65-57 win 
over Newbury Park Friday at Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions have actually won their photo finish with co-champion Simi 
Valley. Based on a league point system, Camarillo (17-6, 9-3) will be the 
league's top-seeded team in the upcoming playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But what about those questions? 
</P>
<P>
Is David Harbour, who leads the team in scoring and assists and is among the 
leaders in rebounding, really a sophomore? How many years did he stay back, 
anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
And how about point guard Rick Schnell? Why has nobody heard of his defense, 
his ballhandling? 
</P>
<P>
Did forwards Jason Hunt and Scott Foster teethe on barbells as infants? These 
two look like they could bench-press the team bus. Heck, slap another Yugo on 
each side of the bar. 
</P>
<P>
And forward Frank Dews? The guy is too consistent. Mix in an off-game, Frank. 
Only Hunt and Dews are seniors. Is it too late to break up the Scorpions? 
</P>
<P>
Too late, perhaps, for the league, as Camarillo became the first team in four 
years other than Simi Valley to earn part of the league title. Against Newbury 
Park, the Scorpions did it with Harbour, who scored 23 points, including six of 
13 shots from three-point range. And Dews, who added 16, two from 12 feet away 
with 1:55 left that gave Camarillo a 58-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
And Foster, who had 12 rebounds plus a layup with 12 seconds remaining to seal 
the win. And Schnell, who scored a sneaky 12 points. And Hunt, who played 
rugged defense despite a badly bruised right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
All so simple? Not really. Newbury Park, led by Wayne Cook's 20 points and 11 
rebounds, trailed, 45-35, but rallied to take a 52-51 lead with 5:38 left on 
Cook's 16-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
However, free throws by Dews and Foster and Harbour's sixth three-point basket 
gave the Scorpions a 56-52 lead they never relinquished. Harbour, who had 
struggled for two games, had finally broken out. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach John Harbour: "He came through and hit some big shots for us. He 
(always) thinks he's going to make the next five. And that's a quality you've 
got to have." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly so against Newbury Park (13-10, 4-8), which but for some poor 
free-throw shooting (the Panthers missed the front end of five one-and-one 
opportunities), could have upset the Scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry light, by the way, is out. Camarillo is heading to the payoff 
window. Or should that be playoff window?

GRANADA HILLS DISPOSES OF TAFT BEHIND BROWN'S 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland High Coach Bob Braswell calls him the "Garbage Man." 
</P>
<P>
Taft Coach Jim Woodard chastises him for lack of defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
Opposing fans poke fun at his bulk (6-5, 250 pounds). 
</P>
<P>
But say what you want about Granada Hills' Alvin Brown, he gets the job done 
more often than not. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Brown scored a game-high 28 points and grabbed 14 rebounds to 
lead the Highlanders to a 68-56 upset of Taft in a North Valley League game at 
Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The game meant nothing to Taft (16-5, 6-4 in league play), which has sewn up 
second place in the North Valley, but the win moved Granada Hills (13-8, 5-5) 
into a tie for third with Kennedy and could give the Highlanders a slightly 
weaker first-round opponent when the City Section playoffs open next week. 
</P>
<P>
But how about that Brown? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he's not perfect in everything, but I wouldn't trade him," Granada Hills 
Coach Bob Johnson said. "He's big and round, and he doesn't jump well, but he 
gets the ball in the basket." 
</P>
<P>
Taft's Woodard was slightly less complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boom, score. Boom, score," said Woodard, lowering his shoulder and 
leaning into a reporter, mimicking Brown's play around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard was also displeased that David Puathasnanon, father of former 
Highlander basketball star Sam Puathasnanon, was one of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Puathasnanon called a charging foul on Taft's Tony Middleton (20 points and a 
game-high 17 rebounds) in the fourth quarter, and moments later, after Brown 
had "nudged" Middleton off the floor to score a layup, Puathasnanon whistled 
Woodard for a technical foul when the latter argued for a foul on Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who scored 20 points in the second half and was nine of 14 from the 
floor and nine of 12 from the free-throw line, converted both foul shots for a 
65-54 Highlander lead with 2:07 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Taft had closed to 55-54 midway through the period on a three-point basket by 
Middleton, but Granada Hills went on a 13-0 run over the next three minutes to 
break the game open. 
</P>
<P>
Toreador guard Dedan Thomas, bound for Nevada Las Vegas, made his first shot 
then missed the next eight and finished with two points and 12 assists.

STANFORD SOCKS IT TO CSUN IN 3-GAME VOLLEYBALL SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS J. PARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many of the Cal State Northridge men's volleyball players scribbled "BS" on 
their socks before their Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match against 
Stanford on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, according to team captain Tom Ribarich, was to show support for 
teammate Bob Samuelson, who was suspended from the team earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
The initials obviously didn't stand for Beat Stanford. The Cardinal, ranked 
fifth in the nation, crushed CSUN, 15-7, 15-2, 15-6, in 90 minutes in a WIVA 
match at CSUN. Although the loss of Samuelson -- CSUN's top hitter -- obviously 
hurt the Matadors, odds are his presence in the match wouldn't have affected 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that we played as well as we're capable of playing but I think 
Stanford played excellent," CSUN Coach John Price said. "They dug everything we 
hit (and) once they started playing well, the snowball kept rolling." 
</P>
<P>
Samuelson was suspended Tuesday for disciplinary reasons, Price said. Price 
will meet with Samuelson -- a 6-foot-5 senior -- Monday to discuss Samuelson's 
status. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time I set Bob it's an automatic kill," Ribarich said. "But you can't say, 
'Oh, no! We don't have Bob.' " 
</P>
<P>
Senior middle blocker and 1988 Olympian Scott Fortune led the Cardinal attack 
with 21 kills in 28 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune wasn't the only player getting rich against the Matadors' porous 
defense. Dan Hanan added 17 kills in 19 attempts as the Cardinal (6-1, 3-1 in 
conference play) finished with a .423 hitting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore middle blocker Raphael Tulino led CSUN (2-4, 0-4) with 10 kills and 
Andrew Greskovics added nine.

CLU GIVES UP LEAD IN 9TH, THEN RALLIES TO BEAT MASTER'S, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SALKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Down to his last strike in the bottom of the ninth inning with two out in a 6-6 
tie, Cal Lutheran freshman Danny Weis looked for a pitch to hit. His coach, 
Rich Hill, provided the inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping Coach Hill would give me the green light," Weis said. "When he 
did, I just let loose. I just went out and got it. It was a fastball, low and 
away." 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing two-strike double was Weis' first game-winning hit and propelled 
the Kingsmen to a dramatic 7-6 victory over The Master's College on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But it was visiting Master's that provided the early drama. The Mustangs, 
trailing by two runs, came out swinging in the top of the ninth. They drew 
close, 6-5, on Craig Johnson's run-scoring double, but with two out Master's 
(0-4 overall, 0-2 in NAIA District 3 play) had to look for a light of its own. 
</P>
<P>
Like Weis, Master's third baseman Pete Wilson waved a magic bat, ripping a 
double to right field to tie the score. 
</P>
<P>
This day, however, would have only one hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm numb," Weis said. "The whole thing feels like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Hill offered a more specific game summary. 
</P>
<P>
"Master's played tough, you have to hand it to them," he said. "In the future 
our team has to take advantage of run-scoring situations. Today, I'm just glad 
we escaped with a win." 
</P>
<P>
The victory, in fact, was Cal Lutheran's first. The Kingsmen are 1-1 overall, 
1-0 in district play.

Harvard 78, Bell-Jeff 71 -- The Saracens, who trailed by as many as 10 points 
in the first half, outscored Bell-Jeff, 39-25, in the second half to notch a 
surprising San Fernando Valley League win at Harvard. Mike Beckwith scored a 
team-high 21 points and Rick Osterloh scored 10 of his 18 points in the fourth 
quarter for Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Bell-Jeff guard Greg Dunn, who scored a game-high 26 points, was knocked

24 for the Guards (19-4, 7-3), who dropped their second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 71, Chaminade 68 -- Ken Hicks scored a game-high 27 points and Brian 
Jones added 19 to help the Knights to a San Fernando Valley League win at 
Chaminade. With Notre Dame trailing, 61-60, with about four minutes to play, 
the Knights (16-8, 10-0) received a two-shot technical foul when fans threw 
debris on the court. Brian Jones made both free throws and Notre Dame hung on 
to clinch an undefeated league season. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Miller (25 points), Chris Bruckner (14) and Charlie Fei (12) paced the 
Eagles (8-12, 3-7). 
</P>
<P>
Westlake 58, Channel Islands 49 -- Westlake converted 21 of 35 field-goal 
attempts (60%) against the host Raiders, who finished a winless Marmonte League 
season. Senior center Kurt Schwan scored a game-high 25 points and had 16 
rebounds to lead Westlake (15-9, 8-4), which placed third in league play. 
Schwan made 10 of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Royal 82, Thousand Oaks 65 -- Royal (12-12, 7-5) must hope for an at-large 
playoff berth after finishing fourth in the Marmonte League. The host 
Highlanders built a 45-31 halftime lead, but Thousand Oaks (10-13, 5-7), led by 
Jeff Peterson (team-high 15 points), trimmed Royal's lead to eight late in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Ouellette, however, made a three-point basket -- his 61st of the season 
-- to douse the Lancers' rally. Ouellette finished with a game-high 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs 84, Burbank 67 -- Marnie Calderon scored 20 points and had eight 
assists and Dan Murphy added 18 points to lead the Indians (17-6, 9-1) in a

League with the win at Schurr. Senior forward Brett Wilson scored a game-high 
27 points. Frank Butterfield (16 points, seven assists), Chad Fotheringham 
(11), Rob Curwen (10) scored in double figures for Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 56, Canyon 55 -- Aaron Volpe hit a three-point basket with four seconds 
left as Saugus snapped a 19-game losing streak in the Golden League game. 
Canyon led, 55-47, with two minutes left but failed to score thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 55-51, Saugus (2-20, 1-9) narrowed the deficit to two with 30 seconds 
left when John Harris scored after intercepting an inbounds pass. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Legaux (19 points) and Andy Regenberg (17) led Saugus. Jamil Austin had 19

PEOPLE ON JUNIOR VARSITY TEAMS DON'T GET A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION, BUT THEY'RE 
MORE CONCERNED WITH THE FUTURE THAN THE PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
CORONADO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball has its minor leagues, corporate America its claustrophobic mail rooms 
and politics its city council posts. 
</P>
<P>
These are places where dues are paid, and nobody understands these dues better 
than the most under-recognized group of individuals in high school athletics: 
the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Like its varsity big brother, the junior varsity boys' basketball team at 
Coronado High School has experienced crushing defeats and unforeseen victories. 
But unless JV players make their mark in another varsity sport or in a school 
club or student body office, they are virtual nonentities on campus. Media 
types are appalled when a JV coach even thinks to report a score. The junior 
varsity is an after-thought in a thousand respects. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary purpose of the JVs is to get them ready for varsity," said Thor 
Dekker, Coronado's first-year junior varsity coach. "They don't have the 
fundamentals at this level that they should have gotten in sixth or seventh 
grade. This is where you learn, because you can't win without fundamentals." 
</P>
<P>
A JV player waits for his chance at the big time much like an understudy waits 
for the moment the lead actor falls suddenly ill. 
</P>
<P>
If a JV player has an older sibling, he is already accustomed to the 
hand-me-down syndrome: functional but used uniforms, warmup suits, travel bags 
-- when they're available -- and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have nice uniforms," Dekker said. "The numbers are falling off, they 
don't look that great. But that's good, it's a driving force to get the kids to 
a varsity level." 
</P>
<P>
James Skaalen and Jack Bowen agree. Both are sophomores playing under Dekker 
for the second time (they were on his freshman team) and both have been 
instrumental in the change of direction the team has taken after an 0-6 start, 
when games were lost by as many as 40 points. As members of the section 
champion water polo team, both have varsity experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want really nice uniforms," said Bowen, who is the team's leading 
scorer with a 16-point average. "You know, sometimes you'll see teams with 
really nice uniforms, trimmed with gold cord, and I'm not impressed. That's not 
how you earn respect." 
</P>
<P>
Said Skaalen: "This is just a training ground for varsity. Wearing used 
uniforms doesn't really matter." 
</P>
<P>
With court time so coveted, JVs sometimes greet the dawn with dribbling drills. 
In the evening, when they should be hitting books, some are hitting backboards 
instead. Some play in odd locations such as abandoned churches, while some -- 
with simply nowhere else to go -- are forced outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the program and discretion of the varsity coach, JVs work out with 
either the varsity or freshman teams. The Islanders loosen up each night in the 
weight room while the varsity finishes up in the gym, then play from 5:30 to 7 
with the freshmen, which forces them to practice at half-court. 
</P>
<P>
"Half-court is where the fundamentals are learned," Dekker said. "Defensive 
slides, screening out, hitting the outlet man. Full-court is more for the 
transition game." 
</P>
<P>
But half-court practice does get frustrating. "We get full-court practice once 
a week," Dekker said. "How can you work on a full-court game when you never get 
to practice it?" 
</P>
<P>
Coaches and officials at this level are part of a giant degreening process, 
qualified but often young and inexperienced. At Coronado, the JV coach is paid 
$1,674, compared to $2,232 for the varsity. Decker said the money isn't 
important. "That's not why I'm doing this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in varsity and JV coaches is primarily experience, of course," 
said Robbin Adair, Coronado's athletic director. "We try and get credentialed 
teachers first, then it's a matter of experience. We thought all along that 
Thor would do well in the JV slot. He seems to do real well with that age 
group." 
</P>
<P>
Dekker, 24, a June graduate of UCSD, coached Coronado's freshman team for two 
years before being elevated to the JV, where he said the learning process never 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm learning," Dekker said. "The pace of the game gets faster as you go up the 
ladder. A simple offense at the freshman level would be torn up at this level 
the same as a JV offense would be torn up at the varsity level. It takes trial 
and error to see what works." 
</P>
<P>
He is regarded highly by varsity Coach Bob Stanton and the kids he coaches but 
said he isn't ready for a varsity position -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as moving up," he said, "I'm content with what I'm doing. Varsity would 
be a new experience. Right now, I don't know if I'd be ready for a varsity 
team. Maybe after one more year at this level." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton says, "The kids respect Thor." And, he added, "he doesn't have a great 
lot of talent, and to his credit, he's gotten them to play together." 
</P>
<P>
The JV teams endure sparse crowds that increase only when they share twin 
billing with the varsity, when first-place is at stake or when a cross-town 
rival is involved. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in crowds is night and day," Adair said. "The varsity crowd 
starts filtering in 40 minutes before the game, while the JVs are still 
playing. Usually, there's not 50 people in the gym for a JV game. Our gym holds 
400 and is filled to capacity for varsity. There's a big discrepancy." 
</P>
<P>
But JV players don't need the spark of the crowds to enhance their play. 
</P>
<P>
"They accept the fact that people are coming to watch the varsity," Dekker 
said. "They rely on themselves for motivation." 
</P>
<P>
Skaalen said friends don't take into consideration what the level of play is. 
"I see a lot of our close friends at our games. They're going to be there 
anyway, it doesn't matter if it's a JV or varsity game." 
</P>
<P>
As a junior varsity coach with few tangibles to offer his players other than 
experience and the lure of the varsity, Dekker said he was surprised there was 
no player fallout after the Islanders' dismal beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't lose anyone," Dekker said. "I was pretty amazed." Two of his players 
didn't make grades, but remaining team members toughed it out. 
</P>
<P>
Now 10-12 and 7-8 in the Metro Conference, Coronado has recorded upset 
victories over Castle Park and Southwest, leading teams in the league. On 
Wednesday, the Islanders lost, 48-45, to Hilltop, a team that beat them by 20 
in their first meeting; they routed Mar Vista, 85-54, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere between 0-6 and 10-12, pessimism and mediocrity evolved into 
perseverance and respectability. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Coronado is used to getting beat, so they accepted it at first," 
Dekker said. "But I'm not used to getting beat, and my attitude carried over." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bowen: "It wasn't real satisfying at first. I wasn't used to playing on a 
team like that. I give a lot of credit to Thor. He went over all the plays that 
we should have known about all along. That helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"We knew something was wrong," Skaalen said. "It was embarrassing. We finally 
got tired of the attitude that, 'Oh, this is Coronado. No problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
He's here for the satisfaction. After knocking off Castle Park and Southwest, 
"I just couldn't describe how I felt," he said. "It was indescribable. It makes 
coaching worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Stanton says Dekker approached him at the beginning of season with little 
optimism. "He told me he had kids who couldn't even dribble," Stanton said. "He 
was really discouraged. He didn't think we'd win a game all season, and I 
agreed with him." 
</P>
<P>
At Coronado, one basketball tryout is held in November to pick the varsity, 
junior varsity and freshmen teams. Placement is contingent on experience, 
playing ability and what serves the best interests of the player and the 
program, according to Stanton, Dekker and freshman Coach Julian Rubalcaba. 
</P>
<P>
Dekker said there are young kids capable of playing varsity but that the best 
interests of the player are more likely to be served at the JV level. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are ready," he said, "but they wouldn't play as much. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most kids would rather play varsity. They see all the glory in 
varsity, but there's a level of confidence gained by playing JV that you don't 
get on the varsity if you don't have much experience." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, playing time is the bottom line for many players. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd much rather play JV all the time then sit on the varsity bench," Bowen 
said. "I'll learn a lot more here than I will with a varsity letter, just 
sitting on the bench. Who wants to sit on a bench? It's more fun for me here, 
giving it my all. Next year, I'd definitely like to be key player on the 
varsity." 
</P>
<P>
Skaalen said JV time is proving time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a testing ground," Skaalen said. "We know we have to work our way up 
and prove ourselves. We're always trying to improve for varsity." 
</P>
<P>
Just a start on paying life's dues, with a down payment that seems well worth 
it.

DAVE DISTEL: FOR CHARGERS TO REACH SUPER BOWL, HENNING MUST BREAK CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bless the Chargers. They have done it. After seven weeks and three days of 
dogged search, they have found the man who fits the criteria to be their new 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently and incongruously, it took so long because only one man fit the 
criteria . . . and they kept thinking there had to be someone else. 
</P>
<P>
They were looking for a man with previous head coaching experience in the 
National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, I have to assume that there was only one former NFL head 
coach both alive and available. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
All the others had to be employed, retired or deceased. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the director of football operations, identified Henning as an 
available, living former head coach rather early in the proceedings but did not 
jump to a hasty conclusion. Given all the rumors of Elvis sightings, Ortmayer 
must have been perusing the tabloids for reports of a Vince Lombardi sighting. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow can never be too careful. 
</P>
<P>
But what was this charade, as Chicago Bears assistant Johnny Roland called it, 
with all the other candidates? Why were Ron Lynn and Wayne Sevier and Mike 
White and Jerry Rhome and Floyd Peters and, yes, Johnny Roland strung along for 
so long when none of them fit the criteria? 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer should have told them: "Listen, guys, I've found one living former 
head coach who's available. It's gonna be his job, unless, of course, another 
living former head coach calls me between now and Valentine's Day." 
</P>
<P>
No one called. 
</P>
<P>
And so it came to pass that Dan Henning was introduced Thursday, though one 
television station carried a graphic identifying him as Doug Henning. 
</P>
<P>
This was a disconcerting press conference, because I kept hearing the word 
"Chargers" and the term "Super Bowl" in the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
More appropriately, these should be part of a question on an SAT test . . . 
except it would be so easy that even an athlete could pass it. 
</P>
<P>
To wit . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Identify the word or term that does not associate in any way with the word or 
term in bold face: 
</P>
<P>
 Chargers 
</P>
<P>
A. Mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
B. Discombobulated. 
</P>
<P>
C. Dull. 
</P>
<P>
D. Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Bonzo, the correct answer is D. Unfortunately, it will not get 
you into MIT, because three chimpanzees at the Wild Animal Park also got this 
one right. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, throughout this press conference, the talk was of the Chargers and the 
Super Bowl. If someone had said something about it happening within our 
grandchildren's lifetime, it would have been credible. However, I got the 
impression they were suggesting this was a possibility within the five-year 
term of Henning's contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan Henning is our guy," gushed owner Alex Spanos. "He comes highly 
recommended. I know he's the guy to take us all the way." 
</P>
<P>
That was the sales pitch. Dan was The Man. He would change the course of this 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of the Chargers and their fans, it would be nice if this optimism 
was well-placed. However, Henning would also have to change the course of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Henning's previous head-coaching experience encompassed four years 
with the Atlanta Falcons. The record was 22-41-1. 
</P>
<P>
In defense of his record, Henning said: "Statistics . . . You can do anything 
you want with them." 
</P>
<P>
That being the case, it is probably of no consequence to note that Henning took 
a bedraggled franchise and did make steady statistical improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Henning (and the Charger hierarchy) spent considerable time at the 
press conference explaining what happened in Atlanta and why it will be 
different here. 
</P>
<P>
History comes into play because history tells us there is little likelihood 
that it will be any different here. 
</P>
<P>
Let's forget all of the post-hiring rhetoric and take a look at the history of 
Super Bowl coaches, because that happens to be what the Chargers think they've 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
I am going to invent (or at least borrow) a term here. I am going to take a 
look at what "recycled coaches" have done in the Super Bowl. A recycled coach 
is defined here as one who had "previous experience" as an NFL head coach 
before joining the team he took to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Only three such people exist -- Weeb Ewbank, George Allen and Don Shula. Every 
other Super Bowl head coach got it done with his original team. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Ewbank, Allen and Shula all had considerable success with their 
original teams before taking new positions and going to the Super Bowl: 
</P>
<P>
* Ewbank won two NFL championships with the Baltimore Colts in the '50s before 
taking the New York Jets to Joe Namath's guaranteed victory in the 1969 Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* Allen was 49-19-4 in five years with the Rams before taking Washington to the 
1973 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
* Shula took Baltimore, his original team, to one Super Bowl and then moved to 
Miami and went to five more. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the franchises hiring these "recycled coaches" were buying a history 
of success, and it was no surprise that they were parties to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Dan Henning will be the breakthrough coach. Perhaps he will be the 
first to fail in one job and rise to a Super Bowl in the next. Perhaps Steve 
Ortmayer's insistence on previous head-coaching experience was a stroke of 
genius, although the expression has never been applied to the current Charger 
honchos. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, I wonder if Alex Spanos would be interested in a used car I'm 
trying to sell. Should be no problem. It's on its second engine.

BRITAIN ENDS PROBE OF MILITARY HERO'S ALLEGED WAR CRIMES

<P>
The Ministry of Defense said Friday it had dropped its probe into allegations 
that one of Britain's most decorated war heroes ordered the machine-gunning of 
seven German prisoners in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
An inquiry began Monday into the alleged actions of the World War II hero, 
Commander Tony Miers, who died in 1986, after the Sunday Telegraph published 
the claims that were earlier printed in a biography by author Ludovic Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Miers ordered the crew of his submarine to shoot seven 
Germans who were adrift in a dinghy in the Mediterranean after the submarine 
sank a freighter off Crete. 
</P>
<P>
"We have noted these matters were considered at the time by the Admiralty and 
it was decided no further action should be taken," a ministry spokesman said.

An 18-year-old Mexican migrant worker has died of rabies, a rare type of 
fatality last reported in Oregon a decade ago, authorities said Friday. A state 
health officer said the source of the rabies that killed the man last week was 
not known, but might have been a bat.

STUDY BY U.S. NAVY, MEXICANS SHOWS NO AIDS IN 357 TIJUANA PROSTITUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A collaborative study by Mexican health officials and U. S. Navy personnel has 
found that none of 357 Tijuana prostitutes tested were infected with the AIDS 
virus, the Navy said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The results, coupled with similar findings from a separate study of prostitutes 
and other Mexican citizens at high risk for AIDS, would indicate that infection 
is not prevalent among prostitutes in the border city -- long a destination for 
U. S. thrill-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
"What is says is that there's a very low risk factor," said Chief Craig 
Huebler, a Navy spokesman in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The two recent studies reflect a growing collaborative effort between U. S. and 
Mexican health officials concerned that the border region could facilitate the 
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy became involved, Huebler said, at the request of health authorities 
from the city of Tijuana and the Baja California state government, who lack the 
volume of sophisticated testing devices and methods found in U. S. 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Navy Conducted Lab Tests 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials selected the participants in the survey and took the blood 
specimens, Huebler said, while the Navy's role principally involved testing the 
blood for evidence of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy was asked by the Mexican government, because we had the technology," 
Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
The samples were taken almost a year ago, Huebler said, but the results were 
only final last week. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is an extremely sensitive one in border areas. Any kind of "AIDS 
scare" in Mexican border cities would probably frighten off U. S. tourists, who 
represent a prime source of revenue. Some activists in Mexico have charged that 
the government has deliberately attempted to underestimate the number of AIDS 
cases -- an allegation denied by Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy study tends to confirm the results of a previous binational AIDS 
initiative in Tijuana, which was conducted by Mexican health officials and the 
California Department of Health Services. That study found that only 2 of 415 
prostitutes surveyed were infected with the AIDS virus, said Dr. Abram 
Benenson, a professor at the San Diego State University School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials, noting the large number of AIDS cases in the United States, 
have worried that U. S. citizens might spread the disease south of the border. 
U. S. health authorities, meantime, have expressed concern that prostitutes 
could be infecting U. S. visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The two recent studies would tend to indicate otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana is considered perhaps the third-largest AIDS center in Mexico, after 
Mexico City and Guadalajara. As of late last year, Tijuana reported fewer than 
100 AIDS cases -- a number that many say underestimates the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that a number of factors -- notably the relative social 
disapproval of homosexuality -- has resulted in a vast under-reporting of the 
problem south of the border. Homosexuals and people who use intravenous drugs 
are among those most at risk of contracting the ailment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexico Asked Navy for Help 
</P>
<P>
The genesis of the Navy study, a spokesman explained Friday, occurred in 1987, 
when Mexican officials approached the service and inquired about assistance in 
an AIDS-testing project. (Mexican officials could not be reached for comment 
Friday.) 
</P>
<P>
The Navy had an obvious interest, a spokesman explained. Tijuana has been an 
almost-legendary destination for reveling sailors and other military personnel. 
About 102,000 Navy personnel are based in San Diego; only Norfolk, Va., with 
120,000, is home to more sailors among U. S. ports. In fact, some San 
Diego-based sailors live in Tijuana; that number is thought to be fewer than 
100. 
</P>
<P>
For Navy second class petty officers or lesser ranks, there is a Tijuana curfew 
between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have Navy personnel who go down to Tijuana, so that is a concern," 
Huebler said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has conducted similar studies in other nations, Huebler said. The 
Philippines, with its huge population of U. S. sailors and native prostitutes, 
is one other area where such a survey has been done, the spokesman noted. 
</P>
<P>
For the Tijuana study, the Navy assistance was provided by the San Diego-based 
Environmental and Preventive Unit Five, which falls under the jurisdiction of 
the Naval Environmental Health Center, Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy spokesman provided the following account of the study: 
</P>
<P>
Testing occurred during a 30-day period in February, 1988. The women were 
selected by Mexican officials, who also drew the blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 357 prostitutes, the study also tested 360 women who were 
not prostitutes, all drawn from a Tijuana family-planning clinic. Of this 
group, only 2 -- less than 1% -- were found to be infected with the AIDS virus. 
Both are believed to have contracted the virus via blood transfusions, a Navy 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
All 717 participants are presumed to have given their "informed consent" to the 
project. Three Navy officials, two from San Diego and one from Washington, 
helped with the testing in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The blood samples were coded by Mexican officials and shipped across the 
border. The samples were tested in a Navy laboratory in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Counseling of the two persons infected is to be provided by Mexican health 
authorities. The study maintained "strict confidentiality," the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the cost of the study, the spokesman said it was "minimal," but he 
could provide no exact figure.

 2 PLEAD NOT GUILTY IN BEATING DEATHS OF 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former nightclub owner and his ex-bodyguard pleaded not guilty in the 
bludgeoning deaths of four people in Laurel Canyon in 1981, a crime described 
by Liberace's ex-lover as a robbery-retaliation slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Adel (Eddie Nash) Nasrallah, 59, and Gregory DeWitt Diles, 40, are each charged 
with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder in 
the slayings that occurred at a hillside home in the fashionable canyon 
neighborhood on July 1, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The two entered their pleas Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The late sex-film star John Holmes was tried and acquitted of the murders in 
1982. He was questioned about them by authorities looking for leads shortly 
before he died last year of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The case was revived when Scott Thorson, the late entertainer Liberace's former 
lover, came forward with information while he faced a three-year prison term in 
an unrelated case. He was sentenced to three years probation last year.

 PANEL TO REPRESENT DISABLED PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council committee Friday recommended creating a Commission 
on Disability to represent the interests of disabled people in city 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Public Health, Human Resources and Senior Citizens Committee 
voted 2 to 0 to recommend to the full council that it create the commission and 
empower it to function "as an integral part of city government." 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal would elevate the commitment of the city to a new level," said 
Bill Elkins, an executive assistant to Mayor Tom Bradley who testified at the 
committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"This commission would send a message to the federal government and to the 
state government, clearly indicating that the city of Los Angeles is serious 
about its commitment to its disabled community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said the commission might also give the city an advantage in applying 
for federal grants for programs for the disabled.

ANTHONY QUINN'S SON ACQUITTED IN ALLEGED BEATING OF LIVE-IN GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Anthony Quinn's son has been acquitted of felony charges that he beat his 
live-in girlfriend, whom a defense attorney depicted as a crazed woman like the 
villain in the movie "Fatal Attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Francesco Quinn, an actor whose credits include several television roles and a 
part in the movie "Platoon," was found not guilty Thursday of beating Carolyn 
Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charges stemmed from an alleged fight on Oct. 31, 1987, between 
Quinn, 25, and Greenberg, 24, who shared a West Hollywood condominium. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument Wednesday, defense attorney Godfrey Isaac told a jury 
in Santa Monica Superior Court that no beating occurred. He portrayed Greenberg 
as an emotionally unstable would-be model who, like the female villain in the 
movie "Fatal Attraction," could not let go of a romantic involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg alleged Quinn that beat her on the arms, struck her in the stomach 
and kicked her in the side as she cowered on the bathroom floor of their condo. 
</P>
<P>
The injuries resulted in a ruptured spleen, which doctors removed several weeks 
after the fight, according to testimony at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Isaac maintained that Greenberg was injured while riding a dirt bike and lied 
about the cause of her injuries because she was desperate over the failure of 
the relationship.

ACTIVIST COUPLE QUESTION ETHICS OF TV REPORTER IN ON-CAMERA ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A local activist couple have raised questions about the ethics of a television 
reporter who arranged an on-camera arrest of a man wanted for a parole 
violation after luring him with a request for an interview about homeless 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Logan Heights activists Al and Denise Ducheny said that Channel 39 reporter 
Paul Bloom, who reports a regular "Crime Watch" segment for the station, lied 
about his intentions when he requested an interview with William Hammond, 
president of the local Coalition for the Homeless and an active lobbyist for 
the homeless. The Duchenys said that Bloom called Hammond, 30, who worked out 
of their office, and requested an interview about his work for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom asked a few questions about homeless issues, said Al Ducheny, but quickly 
turned the interview to the issue of Hammond's parole violation. Moments later, 
"a whole bunch of cops" and a parole officer descended on Hammond and 
handcuffed him, Ducheny said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saw an Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said that, as a journalist, he saw "an opportunity to go interview a 
parole violator and, as a citizen, I notified his parole officer" and police. 
Saying he saw nothing unethical about the arrest, Bloom added that he was 
"acting as an advocate of law and order" when he arranged for the arrest of 
Hammond on Feb. 3. Bloom reports regularly on crime issues dealing with 
combating crime and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Parole agent Gary Akin said Hammond was on parole for a 1985 conviction on 
possession of marijuana for sale. Akin said Hammond was paroled Feb. 27, 1986, 
and sent back to prison July 15, 1987, for breaking his parole. He was paroled 
again Dec. 11, 1987, and had not reported to his parole officer in several 
months, Akin said. 
</P>
<P>
The events leading to Hammond's arrest began "a few weeks ago," Bloom said, 
when police saw him "on TV or somewhere in a shot of some homeless 
demonstration." He said police alerted him to the fact that Hammond was a 
parole violator. 
</P>
<P>
KNSD News Director Nancy Bauer approved the scheme, Bloom said, after much 
debate among station officials. Bauer failed to return a reporter's phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 received a bomb threat shortly before its 5 p.m. news broadcast 
Friday, with a caller saying a device had been placed in the studio as 
retribution for Bloom's report. San Diego police were called but nothing was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom called Hammond "a dangerous criminal with a fairly long criminal record 
of violent crimes." According to Bloom, Hammond had been arrested on two 
previous occasions with arms in his possession. Akin answered "No comment" when 
asked if he agreed that Hammond was a dangerous felon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Makes No Apology 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, a former Channel 39 anchorman, made no apology for arranging Hammond's 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I have really good journalistic ethics. I believe in the truth and telling the 
truth. The truth is that this man is a wanted criminal who was supposed to be 
back in jail and wasn't," Bloom said. " . . . I don't believe that journalistic 
ethics precludes me from setting up an interview with a wanted felon and then 
letting the police know. . . . I called his parole officer and told him I was 
going to interview the guy at 1 p.m. I know what you're thinking, 'Is this 
proper reporter involvement?' You folks in the print media tend to report more 
about us than we do about you." 
</P>
<P>
Denise Ducheny argued that Bloom breached all journalistic ethics by arranging 
Hammond's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect to have a certain degree of confidence in a reporter. You don't 
expect a reporter to put you in a compromising position, much less bring a 
bunch of cops with him when he interviews you," Ducheny said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Bloom's Channel 39 colleagues who requested anonymity said they had 
ethical problems with the incident involving Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling around here is that he acted as an agent of the police and was 
doing their dirty work for them. . . . He seems to have blurred the distinction 
between reporting on the cops and playing cop," one reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reacted Angrily 
</P>
<P>
Bloom reacted angrily to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not acting as an advocate of the police," he said. "I am acting as an 
advocate for law and order. I am an advocate for the public getting involved. I 
am against people sitting on their duffs, letting the police do all the work." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond, who is in County Jail, could not be reached for comment. He had not 
reported to his parole agent since April and a warrant was issued for his 
arrest in August. Besides parole violation, Hammond has been charged with 
having access to a firearm and possessing a knife with a blade longer than 2 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom said he had notified the parole agent that Ducheny, who has a license to 
carry a concealed weapon, kept a handgun in a desk drawer in the same office 
where Hammond worked as president of the homeless coalition. That led to the 
charge against Hammond that he had access to a firearm.

FUGITIVE ESCAPES FROM GUARD AT HOSPITAL; 
</P>
<P>
3RD INMATE TO FLEE IN 2 MONTHS CAPTURED AFTER WRECKING TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 27-year-old fugitive from Colorado escaped from the Sheriff's Department's 
custody at UC San Diego Medical Center on Friday, the third such escape from a 
hospital room in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
In each case the inmate was guarded by unarmed security guards employed by the 
Wackenhut Corp., which is under contract to the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoner who escaped Friday, Mark McGinley of La Mesa, eluded two Wackenhut 
security guards but was arrested after crashing a stolen truck into a tree 
across the street from the San Diego Police Department's Western Division 
substation, according to Sheriff's Department spokesman Sgt. Bob Takeshta. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials had considered McGinley to be an escape risk, which is why he 
was being guarded, Takeshta said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the escape occurred about noon when, with one of the 
guards apparently at lunch, McGinley asked the other guard for permission to 
take a shower. McGinley then asked for shampoo and, when the guard left to get 
it, escaped from his 10th-floor room by taking a stairway that leads outside. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 29-year-old Lakhwinver Fingh of Poway stopped his pickup 
truck in front of the hospital to drop off an acquaintance. When Fingh opened 
his door, McGinley pulled him out of the truck and drove away in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
A San Diego police officer later spotted the truck and attempted unsuccessfully 
to pull it over, initiating a chase that ended when McGinley crashed the truck 
into a tree across from the police substation, at Friars Road and Gaines 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
McGinley, who is wanted in Colorado for parole violation, was held on suspicion 
of escape, auto theft and robbery, police said. After being treated for a 
bruised right knee at UCSD Medical Center, McGinley was transferred to 
Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, where he remained under guard -- by a 
sheriff's deputy -- Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Sunday on suspicion of robbery and auto theft, McGinley was taken to 
UCSD Medical Center for kidney dialysis, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Three days earlier, paramedics had taken McGinley from a private residence to 
Alvarado Hospital for treatment of kidney problems. Despite being warned by the 
head nurse that he still required medical attention, he left the hospital 
Sunday. Police arrested him later that day. 
</P>
<P>
In light of Friday's escape, Sheriff's Department administrators will likely 
review their policy of using the unarmed Wackenhut guards to watch over 
prisoners being treated at hospitals, Takeshta said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department this year will pay Wackenhut $410,000 to provide 
security for hospitalized prisoners, according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's escape was the third this year involving Wackenhut guards. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 29, a man in custody at Mercy Hospital escaped with the help of his 
girlfriend, who told the guard that she had a weapon and a bomb in a sack, 
according to sheriff's deputies. The prisoner had been arrested on suspicion of 
robbery and narcotics and weapons violations. The couple kidnaped the guard and 
later released him in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Another man guarded by a Wackenhut guard escaped Jan. 3 from Physicians &amp; 
Surgeons Hospital by jumping out a fourth-floor window, Takeshta said. That man 
was being held on narcotics charges.

It wasn't Los Angeles' cold weather that was bothering Alicia and Philip 
Hetzel. 
</P>
<P>
It was the city's cold heart that discouraged the couple as they stood Friday 
in a shopping center parking lot in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"Desperate! Been Robbed. Need a Job. We been in a cleaning business in 
Sacramento!" read the hand-painted cardboard sign held by Alicia Hetzel. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers hurrying in and out of the trendy shops that line Ventura Boulevard 
looked the other way. 
</P>
<P>
No one paused long enough to ask 48-year-old Philip Hetzel about the robbery -- 
or to look at the carefully folded police report on the dashboard of his 1969 
Rambler that told how two armed men took $1,200 from him Jan. 24 in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't stop to examine his letter of recommendation from his last employer 
in Warren, Mich., or to discuss the couple's recent experience in Sacramento as 
housecleaners and janitors. 
</P>
<P>
There was a fine line between sympathy and suspicion from shoppers, who 
recently have been subjected to increasing numbers of panhandlers in Studio 
City and to a well-publicized fraud involving parking-lot con artists, the 
"Yuppie Panhandlers," pretending to be down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a part of the world, Russia, where people are poor. I think 
they're legit. If I could, I would give them a job," said Isak Bekman of North 
Hollywood, who passed them on his way to a bank. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just another face asking for money. Sometimes I give, sometimes I 
don't," said Studio City resident Paul Lichtenberg, who passed the Hetzels 
without stopping. "It could be real or it could be a scam, either one." 
</P>
<P>
A Woodland Hills resident leaving a boutique was sure it was the latter. "You 
see too much of this now. If you need a job, it's out there," said the woman, 
who would not give her name. 
</P>
<P>
The Hetzels said they were unaware of the "Yuppie Panhandlers," Jeffrey Dwayne 
Allman, 31, and Tracy Chris Hartland, 24, who were sentenced to 15 months in 
jail Jan. 30 for swindling more than 300 people in the Los Angeles area by 
pretending to be penniless travelers. Allman and Hartland allegedly made up to 
$200 an hour by begging in shopping center parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Hetzel, 32, said she and her husband want to earn only enough money to 
return to Michigan, where Philip Hetzel worked for 10 years before permanently 
injuring his back in a factory accident. 
</P>
<P>
The couple spent the $18,000 received from a disability settlement to move a 
year ago to Citrus Heights near Sacramento, where they started a cleaning 
business. When business dropped off, they sold all their belongings and came to 
Los Angeles, where Alicia Hetzel has relatives. 
</P>
<P>
She said she had a falling-out with her family. 
</P>
<P>
Hetzel said he was robbed as he left a temporary janitorial job at a Northridge 
firm two days after arriving in Los Angeles. They were living in their car and 
his pocket was the safest place for the money, the proceeds from selling their 
furniture in Sacramento, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like L.A. We just want to leave," Alicia Hetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, the couple had received two job leads, but no promises. They said 
they were hoping for a mild night because they were going to sleep in their 
Rambler. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cold world," Alicia Hetzel said.

SANTA CLARITA TO WEIGH LIMITS ON CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council will consider a proposal next week that would 
limit campaign contributions in municipal elections. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is the brainchild of the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning 
and Environment, a watchdog citizens group commonly known as SCOPE. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, candidates for City Council could not accept more than $250 
from a single contributor. Candidates could borrow no more than $250 from 
individuals and no more than $1,000 from any one bank to finance their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, candidates could not accept contributions from people "with assumed 
names" or from businesses contracting with the city. Businesses with bids 
pending on city contracts would also be prohibited from contributing to City 
Council races. 
</P>
<P>
Donations from anonymous contributors would be limited to no more than $50 per 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curbing Influence 
</P>
<P>
The group recommended the fund-raising restrictions to water down the influence 
of developers over planning, SCOPE President Robert Silverstein said Friday. 
Such influence over the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors produced 
runaway development that has overcrowded the schools and clogged the streets of 
the Santa Clarita Valley, he charged. 
</P>
<P>
"They buy their votes," Silverstein said of developers. "And we don't think 
that's fair." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita, incorporated Dec. 15, 1987, has had only one election. 
Silverstein said his organization hopes that the council approves campaign 
restrictions now to avoid problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Three council members -- Dennis Koontz, Jo Anne Darcy and Carl Boyer III -- 
will face reelection in April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 6 memo to the City Council released Friday, City Atty. Carl K. Newton 
said state law would allow Santa Clarita to enact all but one of the 
recommendations. The group had recommended a $7,200 limit on overall spending 
per candidate, but state law prohibits the city from limiting campaign 
spending, Newton said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will discuss the proposal in the council chambers, 23920 
Valencia Blvd., at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission agreed unanimously Friday to approve the 
first phase of a sprawling scientific research park atop Torrey Pines Mesa, but 
delayed a decision on the rest of the proposal because of environmental 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Sierra Club and homeowners around the site of the 300-acre 
Torrey Pines Science Center asked for the two-month delay so local residents 
can voice worries during the commission's April meeting in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have expressed concern about the project because of the 
impact of grading on a large canyon on the eastern edge of the project that 
contains 22 acres of coastal sage shrub and is a prime habitat for the 
black-tailed gnatcatcher, a bird being considered for the U.S. endangered 
species list. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission agreed to delay a decision on the bulk of the project, 
it gave the green light for the first phase, which will consist of several 
research buildings on a less-sensitive parcel sandwiched between North Torrey 
Pines Road and the existing General Atomics plant. The first phase encompasses 
roughly one-eighth of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The project, being planned by the Chevron Land &amp; Development Co., is 
bounded by Interstate 5 on the east, Genesee Avenue to the south and North 
Torrey Pines Road on the west. The entire proposal calls for 2.5 million square 
feet of office space for as many as 30 firms and between 3,000 and 5,000 
employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
I am supporting the proposed Phoenix House/Nancy Reagan Center to be located in 
Lake View Terrace on the site of the former Pacoima Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The long-term residential care offered there will be one of the few resources 
available in the San Fernando Valley for the rehabilitation of teens. I believe 
the outcry by neighbors should be considered and compromises be made to satisfy 
some of their demands. However, their objection to the treatment center should 
not be the determining factor for the zoning commission to deny Phoenix House 
the permits necessary to operate in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
Many young adults die from drug overdoses or commit suicide from depression 
brought on by the use of drugs. The Valley needs more treatment facilities for 
these young people so they may reclaim their lives.

BITTER CONTRACT FIGHT KILLED HEDGECOCK SHOW 
</P>

A demand by former Mayor Roger Hedgecock's representative for a one-page 
agreement committing KGTV (Channel 10) to 13 weeks of Hedgecock's talk show led 
to the show's sudden demise, station officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The talk show was canceled Wednesday after the first and only episode had aired 
the previous Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Channel 10 program manager Don Lundy, he and Mel Buxbaum, 
Hedgecock's former press secretary and the show's producer, had reached an 
agreement on a contract calling for 13 weeks of the show. The contract included 
provisions giving the station the right to review the show's subject matter 
before production and to cancel the show if it did not attract ratings. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, Lundy said Buxbaum called and said that Hedgecock would 
not do the next show, scheduled to be taped Thursday, unless the station signed 
a one-page agreement committing the station to 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to get stuck with a show that was a loser," Lundy said. "It is 
something we do with every show." 
</P>
<P>
Buxbaum said Friday that he never made any demands, that he only sought to 
further negotiate the contract the station had sent him. The deal fell through, 
Buxbaum said, when Channel 10 refused to negotiate. Quinn and Lundy had 
promised to supply the one-page agreement, he added. 
</P>
<P>
On his KSDO-AM (1130) talk show Thursday morning, several callers suggested 
that the show had been canceled because Channel 10 wanted to avoid 
controversial subjects. Hedgecock encouraged listeners to call the station to 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it inconceivable that viewers and listeners would make that assumption 
and Hedgecock, knowing the truth, would play along with it," Channel 10 general 
manager Ed Quinn said Friday, noting that Channel 10 airs such "controversial" 
personalities as Oprah Winfrey, Michael Tuck and Morton Downey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly not afraid of controversy," Quinn said. "That's simply 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lundy, the agreed-upon contract gave control of the show to 
Buxbaum's production company, with only a few standard content "review" 
stipulations. However, the agreement that Hedgecock wanted would have given the 
ex-mayor "carte blanche" to put anything on the air, Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
"All he wanted was a one-page agreement that essentially said 'We love Roger 
and we will do 13 weeks,' " Quinn said. "As a businessman I just couldn't do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Buxbaum said several provisions in the contract he received Wednesday, 
including the subject review clause, were never discussed in his negotiations 
with Lundy. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hedgecock, Channel 10 was seeking control of the content. 
</P>
<P>
"The contract that came back basically said they could cancel the show at any 
time," Hedgecock said, noting that he was not involved in the contract 
negotiations. He refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 10 officials said the subject review clause was only an attempt to keep 
the show lively. A first attempt at a show was shelved after both Channel 10 
and Hedgecock agreed it was not up to expected levels. After the first taping, 
most of Buxbaum's production staff either quit or was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"We were having so much trouble with Mel, we weren't going to get into a 
situation with a loosey-goosey, open-ended deal from one show to the next," 
Quinn said.

MEMORY OF PRISON CELL SHAPES FILNER'S VIEW OF RIGHTS FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In the spring of 1961, civil rights leaders put out a call to fill the jails of 
Mississippi, and a shy, slender math major from New York named Bob Filner 
decided to join a Freedom Ride beginning on the campus of Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of kids showed up and signed up to go," said Filner, who recalled 
those events after viewing a screening of the current movie "Mississippi 
Burning." The film focuses on the Klan-ordered executions of three civil rights 
workers in Mississippi in 1964, three years after Filner answered the call and 
ended up in a Mississippi prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to three days before we were going, and there were five of us. And 
(with) a couple of days left, there were three of us. One kid, his father 
bought him a car if he wouldn't go. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally (there were) two of us left. . . . And when we finally got arrested, 
and the names got back to Cornell, they said 'Who's Bob Filner?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jailed as Freedom Rider 
</P>
<P>
These days, Bob Filner is a San Diego City Councilman but, for two months in 
the summer of 1961, Bob Filner was a frightened 18-year-old in the Mississippi 
State Penitentiary at Parchman, a freedom rider trying to help change the 
state's 100-year-old system of racial segregation and get home with his skull 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
In the current examination of Hollywood's tendency to glorify the white 
contribution to the civil rights movement -- "Mississippi Burning" and the 
television movie "Unconquered" have caused the most furor -- Filner's 
perspective is a rare one. He is white and he was there. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested in a Jackson, Miss., bus station for "breach of peace" and "inciting a 
riot" for sitting down in a restaurant with an integrated group, Filner spent 
about two months in Parchman, much of it with civil rights leaders such as 
Stokely Carmichael, who would soon bring the movement to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
By the summer of 1961, Southern law enforcement officers and freedom riders 
were adhering to a prearranged script. Most states would not allow freedom 
riders off the buses, choosing to avoid the publicity that came from arresting 
and jailing them. 
</P>
<P>
But Mississippi, the South's staunchest segregationist state, was still jailing 
the activists. 
</P>
<P>
"By that time, it had gotten pretty stylized," Filner said. "You'd get off in 
Jackson, and you'd get arrested. You'd serve as much time as you could in jail. 
That's as much as we knew. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew people were being beaten up. People were being killed. I don't think 
we thought that would happen to us, but it was a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
After a few days of training in Tennessee and a daylong bus ride, Filner's 
small contingent disembarked in Jackson to a true "Mississippi Burning" mob 
scene of howling whites demanding that they go home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maximum Security 
</P>
<P>
"If we hadn't been arrested, we would have been in real trouble," he said. "We 
would have been lynched." 
</P>
<P>
After a few days in local jails -- Filner doesn't remember an arraignment or a 
trial -- they were shipped to Parchman and locked in tiny maximum-security 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
Guarded by other maximum-security prisoners, "it was a very scary time. . . . 
Kids were beaten up. Kids were dragged around, and you were completely isolated 
from where we had started. Anything could happen to us. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother kept writing to the warden: 'I hope you're taking care of my son,' " 
Filner laughed. "He wrote back: 'Your son Robert is doing fine. He has had 
medical attention.' We (still) have this letter from the warden." 
</P>
<P>
Son Robert wasn't doing all that well, but he was surviving. Isolated from the 
rest of the prison population, the freedom riders were not allowed books, 
letters, newspapers or any other distractions. Once a week they were allowed 
out of their cells to shower and receive fresh clothing. At one point, they 
went on a hunger strike, and prison officials took their clothes and turned on 
the heat during the stifling Mississippi days. 
</P>
<P>
"I was (in a cell) a couple of weeks with one guy. He just went crazy," Filner 
said. "You just had nothing to do all day. People got very frustrated. I may 
have driven the guy crazy myself, because there was enough room to do, sort of, 
sit-ups and push-ups and jumping jacks. Just do it by the bed. I'd be doing 
these jumping jacks or sit-ups and I must have driven him crazy. I mean, I was 
trying to stay sane." 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners set up a disciplined communication system, holding meetings 
without seeing each other. They supported each other in the face of pressure 
from prison officials, sang, and reminded each other why they were there. 
</P>
<P>
"What was dangerous about us, and they recognized that, was our ideas. They 
didn't want us to talk to anybody, any other prisoners, black or white," Filner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the youngest prisoners, Filner was called down to the warden's office 
for offers to go home. "You know what Martin Luther King is doing back in New 
York?" the warden would ask. "He's driving around in a big car and eating good 
meals. And you're here. Don't you want to go home?" 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who had gone through that, we won," Filner said. "That is, as a 
result of our efforts, we changed the laws of Mississippi. We changed American 
history, I think. All of us, working together, not as individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Filner acknowledges that "Mississippi Burning's" major flaws, the target of so 
much criticism, are undeniable. The film's heroes are two white FBI agents who 
solve the murders of three freedom riders, two white and one black, by 
resorting to the same kind of violent intimidation that the Ku Klux Klan used 
to terrorize blacks into silence. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, when they are on screen at all, are depicted as passive, long-suffering 
victims and by-standers. 
</P>
<P>
The film has that backward, Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that bothers me most about the movie was that there was no black 
leadership," he said. "And that's who did it. We were supporting characters. We 
gave it some protection, and we brought in the FBI . . . but they changed it." 
</P>
<P>
"The ending moral of this movie is you have to become evil to beat the evil," 
he added. "The whole (philosophy) of King and SNCC (the Student Non-Violent 
Coordinating Committee) in those early years . . . the whole point of the civil 
rights movement up through this time was that morality would conquer 
immorality. And we were trained in non-violence, not just as a tactic but as a 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Was the Enemy 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, the FBI was as much the enemy as the local sheriffs who put Filner and 
his companions in a Jackson jail cell. Civil rights leaders didn't count on J. 
Edgar Hoover's troops for anything, and, as Filner noted, the all-white FBI was 
"dragged kicking and screaming" into the case only because two white kids were 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
The movie also stereotypes whites, Filner said, painting all Southerners as 
white trash or Klansmen, ignoring the courtliness of middle- and upper-class 
Southern society, and the segment of the white population that wanted 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its faults, Filner said he liked the movie and is pleased that it was 
made. The palpable fear that pervaded the South during his Mississippi summer 
(and on a subsequent summer Filner spent in Alabama in 1964), is vividly 
portrayed on screen. The movie's opening shot, of separate water fountains for 
whites and blacks, is a compelling reminder of a situation that is unthinkable 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"If you went to the South today, you wouldn't encounter literally any of that," 
he said. "Certainly, the whole legal structure has changed. The economic 
structure has changed. . . .

DANCE FIGURE, ONCE LOST IN DRAIN, RESURFACES

Remember Paul Koverman? He was a familiar figure on San Diego stages for years, 
first as principal dancer with the California Ballet and eventually as ballet 
master for the company. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the dance drain that skims the cream from the local community 
snatched Koverman a few years ago. The enterprising ex-dancer heads a ballet 
school in Phoenix now, and might never have surfaced in San Diego again had it 
not been for a special friendship with Stage Seven's Ellen Richard-Gil. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, Ellen needed a piece for Stage Seven, and she nearly twisted my arm 
to come and set something for them," Koverman said by phone from his studio. "I 
had never done any choreography while in San Diego, because I just didn't think 
I was ready. It takes time to get up the confidence, but Kathryn Irey (artistic 
director of Stage Seven) is open to experimental work, so she gave me a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen some of the small things Paul did for students and a videotape of 
another piece," Richard-Gil said. "He has an incredible imagination and 
musicality. When Kathryn took over, we discussed using Paul, and she went for 
the big risk. It's in keeping with the kind of company Kathryn wants -- a 
dancer's company rather than a vehicle for one choreographer." 
</P>
<P>
Koverman's choreography debut in San Diego during Stage Seven's concert in May 
was a rousing success that opened an important door for its talented designer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very well received, and I've already got the (National Endowment for 
the Arts) coming to see me about a grant," Koverman said. "I'm also planning to 
send tapes to the Boston Ballet." 
</P>
<P>
The work also earned Koverman a return trip to San Diego to choreograph 
"L'estro Armonico" for Stage Seven's concert at 8 p.m. tonight at City College. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his first local effort -- a stark, postmodern work -- Koverman's latest 
creation is firmly rooted in ballet, and he acknowledges that he's "still 
trying to find my style." 
</P>
<P>
Also on this weekend's program is the company debut of Patrick Nollet's modern 
duo, "Valse Triste," and two other premieres: Mieczyslaw Morawski's 
"Schubertones" and James Kelly's "Fronteras," a collaboration with border 
artist Mario Torero.

In a Times story last Sunday about the Jack Dempsey-Tommy Gibbons fight in 
Shelby, Mont., in 1923, it was pointed out that the purse split was $300,000 
for Dempsey, $7,500 for Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Gibbons wound up with much more than that, according to his son, Tom 
Gibbons Jr., who writes: 
</P>
<P>
"After the fight, Dad took me with him on the Pantages Theater (vaudeville) 
tour for 20 weeks. He made $50,000 plus expenses -- in 1923 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad was sheriff of Ramsey County, Minn., for 24 years. He was elected in 1935 
because many were afraid of John Dillinger, the bank robber, and many other 
crooks. But Dad could stand up to any of them."

CRASH VICTIM IDENTIFIED AS RIVERSIDE MAN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside real estate agent has been identified as the victim of a fatal car 
accident on Coast Highway near Laguna Beach, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Mark Mudrick said Glenn C. Calvert, 64, was killed when a man 
driving north on Coast Highway about 2 miles south of Cameo Shores lost control 
of his Corvette, spun into the southbound lanes and smashed into Calvert's 
Mercury Cougar. 
</P>
<P>
Calvert was pronounced dead on arrival at Hoag Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Walid M. Albinali, 22, of Irvine, the driver of the Corvette, remained 
hospitalized Friday with a chest injury and facial cuts. Mudrick said that the 
accident, which occurred about 1:10 p.m., was caused by the weather and that 
Albinali was not cited. Police are still investigating the accident, Mudrick 
said. Two other vehicles were involved in the accident, but neither driver was 
hurt.

MAYOR PLANS TO RESIGN, MOVE TO SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor William Davis said Friday that he will resign at the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 49, and his wife, are planning to move from Cypress to San Clemente in 
March. He said the move will make it more convenient for him to travel to see 
clients of his at Bell Atlantic Leasing Corp. in Costa Mesa, who are scattered 
around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he had planned to announce his resignation after Tuesday's special 
election, but word leaked after his house was sold about 2 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a small town," he said. "When you put your house on the market, people 
are going to know." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, voters will decide the fate of a controversial proposed commercial 
development called Cypress Downs, which surrounds the Los Alamitos race track. 
Davis supports the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked on that plan until it made sense for the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a 16-year resident of Cypress, has served as mayor since November. He 
has been on the City Council since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' four remaining council members must appoint a new mayor within 30 days 
after Davis' resignation, or a special election will be held to select his 
successor.

GATES FOES SEEK TO PROVE SURVEILLANCE OF CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The spotlight in federal court shifted to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Randall 
Blair on Friday as attorneys for a private investigator tried again to show a 
pattern of surveillance and harassment of Sheriff Brad Gates' critics. 
</P>
<P>
Blair, a member of Gates' intelligence unit, conceded that his previous denials 
that surveillance had occurred were false, but he attributed them to lapses of 
memory and "a bonehead mistake." 
</P>
<P>
And while he remembered listening in a parked car while a hidden transmitter 
broadcast what one of Gates' political opponents was saying during a college 
lecture, Blair testified that he did not remember a tape-recording being made. 
</P>
<P>
(The tape-recording of that lecture was found in a deputy sheriff's garage in 
1987, and soon afterward the county paid a $375,000 out-of-court settlement to 
the lecturer, George Wright, and another Gates political opponent, former 
Municipal Judge Bobby D. Youngblood.) 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the current trial is whether Gates' investigators were justified in 
their investigation of Preston Guillory, a private investigator who in 1984 was 
working on behalf of Youngblood in his suit against Gates. Guillory is alleging 
conspiracy to deprive him of his civil rights and is asking for $5 million in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acquitted of Charges 
</P>
<P>
After an investigation by Gates' detectives, Guillory was tried for illegally 
carrying a firearm and impersonating an officer and was acquitted in 1985. At 
question is the motive for launching the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Blair testified Friday, the fourth day of the trial, that the investigation 
into Guillory's case began when longtime informant Richard Wilder called him in 
1984. Wilder was a co-defendant in the suit that Youngblood had filed against 
Gates, and Guillory was trying to find him in order to serve legal papers. 
</P>
<P>
When Guillory did find Wilder, he invited Anaheim police along because Wilder 
was wanted for a traffic violation. After Wilder was arrested by Anaheim 
police, Blair testified, he called Blair to say Guillory was carrying a 
concealed gun and had shown police a concealed-gun permit. 
</P>
<P>
Blair said he knew Guillory had no concealed-gun permit because Guillory had 
filed suit against the sheriff because a permit had been denied to him. So 
Blair looked into the report, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
He said Anaheim police informed him that Guillory was wearing his gun exposed 
rather than concealed and had shown them a permit to carry such a weapon. Blair 
said he checked with the state agency that licenses private investigators and 
confirmed that such a permit had been issued to Guillory. 
</P>
<P>
Blair said he was pulled off the investigation at about that time because he 
was a co-defendant in Guillory's lawsuit. Other sheriff's investigators took 
over the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Blair also testified that he met with Youngblood's estranged wife and that at 
one point secretly tape-recorded their conversation and once asked her to go to 
the Youngbloods' home and retrieve documents for his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that he ordered that a conversation of Orange County Register 
reporter Chuck Cook be tape-recorded because Cook was writing articles about 
alleged abuse in the County Jail, which is administered by Gates, and because 
he "may have encouraged some of them (prisoners) to lie." The recording was 
made of an interview Cook conducted in the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Blair said that during a 1985 deposition in which he denied any surveillance of 
Cook, he had not told the truth. "It was a bonehead mistake. I forgot about 
Chuck Cook," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he had not told the truth when he stated, under oath, that there had 
been no surveillance of Youngblood, Wright and others and that no files had 
been created on them, he conceded. "At the time I declared it, I believed those 
statements were true," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by one of Guillory's attorneys, Michael J. Cisarik, however, 
Blair conceded that he had kept the Youngblood file in his desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Gates' attorney Eric L. Dobberteen, Blair said he had 
received reports that Guillory had one of Wilder's passports and suggested to 
Wilder that if he wanted to file a burglary complaint, the Anaheim Police 
Department was the proper place. 
</P>
<P>
Dobberteen's questioning was cut short by adjournment of the trial, which is 
scheduled to resume Tuesday.

L.A. GANG MEMBER GIVEN 42 YEARS FOR SANTA ANA SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Orange County judge on Friday ordered a Los Angeles gang member to serve a 
total of 42 years to life in prison for the murders of two young men during a 
gang battle in the streets of Santa Ana more than 4 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing of Ray Anthony Pina, 28, a member of Los Angeles' Diamond Street 
gang, came 3 weeks after the acquittal of another man who was charged with 
aiding in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
In that Jan. 19 decision, a jury returned a not-guilty verdict in favor of 
Frank W. Halstead, 22, of Echo Park, who was the driver of one car involved in 
the deadly confrontation with Santa Ana gang members on Sept. 9, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought to Use Acquittal 
</P>
<P>
Pina's attorneys had sought to use Halstead's acquittal as one reason for 
granting Pina a new trial, because Halstead -- then facing criminal charges 
himself -- cited the Fifth Amendment when brought to testify at Pina's 1987 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
But Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer denied this and other motions for a 
new trial in sentencing Pina on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, imposing the near-maximum sentence, ordered Pina to serve 10 years 
to life in prison for attempted murder, 17 years to life for one murder 
conviction and 15 years to life for the second murder. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than allow Pina to serve the sentences concurrently, as is often done, 
Rheinheimer ordered that the terms run consecutively for a maximum sentence of 
42 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with this sentence," Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton 
said. "We feel Pina is an extreme danger to society who should get the maximum 
sentenced allowed, and that's borne out by the legacy of dead bodies that he's 
left behind." 
</P>
<P>
Pina had a previous conviction on manslaughter charges in a different case, 
Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case for which he was sentenced Friday, Pina was convicted of fatally 
shooting at least one of two F Troop gang members during the 1984 confrontation 
in the 2000 block of West 5th Street in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Killed that night were Frank Villa, 21, and Anthony Silerio, 18. 
</P>
<P>
Pina was a passenger in a car that night filled with Diamond Street gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County prosecutors maintained that the Los Angeles gang members provoked 
the confrontation by cruising down the streets of Santa Ana shouting "Diamond 
Heads!" and verbally provoking the Santa Ana gang members.

ON THE ROAD AGAIN: SNOW-CLOSED I-5 IS REOPENED AFTER 3 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Interstate 5 -- closed since Tuesday by snowdrifts up to 5 feet deep -- 
reopened Friday, clearing a path to most of the 4,500 motorists and residents 
stranded in the mountains north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans crews managed to scrape away enough snow to open four of the freeway's 
eight lanes at about 6 a.m., permitting the California Highway Patrol to escort 
vehicles through on the still icy pavement at about 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
By 1 p.m., the last flurries from the 3-day storm had moved east, the sun was 
shining, all eight lanes were open, the pavement was largely dry and traffic 
was moving pretty much as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures pushed above freezing for much of the day in the Gorman and Lebec 
areas, and in downtown Los Angeles the thermometer climbed to 64 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Santa Ana reached a high of 64; San Clemente, 64; El Toro, 
61, and Newport Beach, 56. Early morning temperatures dropped to 53 in San 
Clemente, 53 in El Toro and 52 in Newport Beach. Newport Beach, San Clemente 
and Santa Ana reported traces of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The warmer, drier weather means fewer Orange County traffic accidents, said 
Jack Skaggs, California Highway Patrol acting sergeant in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold weather wasn't so bad," he said. "But with rain we always have a rash 
of accidents. It's slippery, and a lot of people don't make the adjustments in 
their speed for it." 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said weekend weather in the Los Angeles Basin should be sunny, with 
highs in the upper 50s to low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
With the improved weather, most of the residents and motorists along Interstate 
5, the state's principal north-south artery, were able to start moving about 
first thing in the morning Friday. But it took people in the isolated back 
country around Lebec, Gorman, Frazier Park and Holiday Valley a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Yates family, which had begun to get anxious Thursday as food and propane 
supplies started running low at their rural home in Holiday Valley, finally 
made it out Friday when a friend with a four-wheel-drive vehicle came to their 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
It was not an easy trip for the husband and wife and their two young sons, 
though. They had to wind about 3 miles through drifts up to 4 feet deep to the 
nearest paved road and then another 10 miles or so on icy pavement to 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cracker Barrel General Store in Frazier Park, about 5 miles up Mt. Pinos 
Road from the interstate, a dozen locals gathered for the first time since 
Tuesday to drink coffee and compare notes. 
</P>
<P>
They talked about the worst storm in more than a decade, the hard work digging 
out and the 2 days of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a lot more kids 9 months from now," Harry Petretti said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Gelinas said that even though all of them had been stuck in their homes, 
that did not mean that neighbors were not watching out for one another. 
</P>
<P>
"We called on the phone to make sure that everyone was OK," she said. "That's 
the nice thing about a small community." 
</P>
<P>
Back beside Interstate 5 in Gorman, trucker Mark Williams watched dejectedly 
from a roadside service station Friday afternoon as other vehicles whizzed 
past. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had stopped to drop off his load of gasoline at the station late 
Tuesday night, "and by the time I got unloaded, I couldn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
Stuck for 2 days in the snow, he finally appeared to be on his way Friday 
morning when a bulldozer cleared a path in front of his truck. But when he 
stepped on the starter, he said, "the battery was dead." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the warmer weather was a welcome change. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's high temperature reading of 64 degrees in Los Angeles was only 4 
degrees below the normal high for the date, but it was 24 degrees below the 
88-degree reading last year, a record for Feb. 10. The low temperature Friday 
was 51 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Beusterien, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., a Wichita-based firm 
that provides forecasts for The Times, said that today promises to be a "great 
day" in the Los Angeles Basin -- "some clouds but a lot of sunshine, with highs 
in the upper 50s to low 60s."

DRIVER KILLED AFTER HITTING BUS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman who was killed after she allegedly ran a red light and struck an 
out-of-service OCTD bus in Santa Ana has been identified as Linda Dianna 
Kinwald, 39, of Fountain Valley, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said Kinwald was westbound on Sunflower Avenue in her 1982 Chrysler 
coupe about 10 p.m. Thursday when she ran the light at Harbor Boulevard. The 
bus dragged the car and a signal light pole with it into the southbound lanes 
of Harbor Boulevard, shattering an Orange County Transit District bus shelter. 
The coroner's office said Kinwald died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
The bus driver, 45-year-old Gloria Novotny of Anaheim, was not injured in the 
accident, and there were no passengers aboard the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Novotny, who has been driving for OCTD for 14 years, "is one of the best 
drivers in the district," OCTD spokeswoman Joanne Curran said. She added that 
Novotny was going to receive an award from the transit district for her safe 
driving record. The Department of Motor Vehicles said Novotny has a clean 
driving record. 
</P>
<P>
Services have not been scheduled for Kinwald, the mother of two children, 
Sally, 12, and Brian, 15. 
</P>
<P>
Kinwald, who worked for Lorimar Home Video in Culver City, is also survived by 
her mother, Mardell Frazier of Port Angeles, Wash.; sisters Bobbie Foye, 41, of 
Washington state, Mary Johns, 34, of San Bernardino, Kathy Howell, 30, of 
California, Terrie Hibbard, 31, of Washington, and her brother, Thomas Greene, 
38, also of Washington.

Mazda Motor Corp. said it will increase the number of its U.S. car dealers to 
900 from the current 820 by the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The company will also raise the ratio of sole dealers in the United States to 
50% from about 30%, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The increase and strengthening of the sales network in the U.S. comes on the 
heels of the introduction of the MX-5 and four-door sedan Capella model cars, 
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda will export MX-5 model cars from Japan, but the Capella will be produced 
by Mazda's wholly owned U.S. subsidiary.

INFLATION FEARS PUSH DOWN BOND PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bond prices lost ground Friday after the government reported wholesale prices 
shot up faster than expected last month. 
</P>
<P>
But prices managed to recover from the day's lows reached shortly after release 
of the wholesale price report. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond finished down 18/32 point, or $5.25 per 
$1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from 
its price, rose to 9.04% from 8.89% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of some 30-year issues plunged by nearly a full point shortly after the 
Labor Department released its report that its producer price index climbed 1% 
in January, its biggest monthly increase since an identical surge in October, 
1985, and equivalent to a 12.7% annual rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The inflation report reignited fears that the Federal Reserve would push 
interest rates higher in a bid to slow the economy and curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as Treasury notes 
and bonds, but so do rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
As the day progressed, bond prices retraced some territory as the dollar surged 
on foreign exchange markets. A rising dollar makes dollar-denominated 
investments more attractive to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell by between 3/16 point and 11/32 point, intermediate maturities fell 11/32 
point and long-term issues were down 1/2 point, according to Telerate Inc., a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 3.83 to 1,127.79. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials fell. Moody's investment grade corporate bond 
index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of 
5 years or longer, lost 0.68 to 298.52. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds fell 17/32 point to close at 91 7/32. The average yield to maturity rose 
to 7.65% from 7.61% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on 3-month Treasury bills rose to 8.86% as the discount rose 9 basis 
points to 8.56%. Yields on 6-month bills rose to 9.05% as the discount rose 13 
basis points to 8.55%. Yields on 1-year bills rose to 9.20% as the discount 
rose 12 basis points to 8.53%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.0625%, down from 9.125% late Thursday.

UPSCALE UNITS LURE AFFLUENT WITH AMENITIES, LOCATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
While young first-time home buyers constitute the biggest portion of the condo 
market, there is another, more affluent market out there. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who could afford upscale single-family homes are choosing condos 
because of the low maintenance and the amenities they provide such as 
recreational facilities, said real estate agent Douglas Ward, an Irvine area 
condo specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Others are going condo because the units offer more for the money than a 
similarly priced single-family home, or because a condo enables them to live in 
a more desirable area than they could otherwise afford. 
</P>
<P>
Mark L. Frazier, president of Barratt American, the home builder that pioneered 
500-square-foot condos in Orange County 5 years ago, said about 30% of the 
market nowadays is for the so-called upscale condo. 
</P>
<P>
"You have people with two incomes making a lot of money and they still can't 
begin to come up with the down payment on a nice enough new detached home in 
Orange County," Frazier said. "So they take the next best thing and buy as big 
a condo as they can in the best area they can find." 
</P>
<P>
That, said Peter Ochs, president of the Fieldstone Co., is called "the choice 
market." 
</P>
<P>
And that is why Irvine Co. owner Donald Bren's development company builds 
$230,000 condos in the Westpark section of that master-planned community and 
why Lusk Homes is building $500,000 condos in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And, said Frazier, that is why Barratt no longer builds tiny starter units. 
</P>
<P>
The company has several projects in the $150,000 to $220,000 range in Orange 
County, he said, and is planning a golf course-oriented condo project in the 
Tustin Ranch development; a place where base prices will run from $230,000 to 
$300,000 with an additional premium of $30,000 to $50,000 for units that are 
right on the fairways.

A POSSIBLE $3-BILLION PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
FORD AEROSPACE LOSES OUT ON TANK DESTROYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ford Aerospace and two other Southern California defense contractors have lost 
out on a multibillion-dollar competition to develop a new generation of 
portable anti-tank weaponry for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
The Army on Thursday selected the contracting team of Dallas-based Texas 
Instruments Inc. and a Florida division of Martin Marietta Corp. to build the 
weapon. The contract could prove to be worth about $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace's Aeronutronic division in Newport Beach had been teamed with 
General Dynamics Corp.'s Valley System division in Rancho Cucamonga in the 
competition. Another losing bidder was the team of Hughes Aircraft Co.'s 
Missile Systems Group in Canoga Park and Honeywell Aerospace and Defense in 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disappointed to lose it," Susan Pearce, a Ford Aerospace spokeswoman, 
said. "It was something we were looking to to expand our business." 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace has been developing the laser beam technology used in its 
version of the weapon for about a decade, Pearce said. About 20 people who 
worked exclusively on the program will be reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
A Hughes spokesman called the decision "disappointing" but said the loss would 
have "no perceptable impact on near-term employment" in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain, however, whether the weapon -- known officially as the 
Advanced Anti-tank Weapon System-Medium -- will ever be built. Although the 
Army has given high priority to the program, some top Pentagon officials and 
members of Congress have questioned the effectiveness of the costly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The AAWS-M weapon is designed to replace the Army's current Dragon anti-tank 
weapon, which has been criticized for being cumbersome to use, as well as 
ineffective against the Soviet Union's newest tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Aerospace/General Dynamics version would have guided the missile to 
the tank with a laser beam. The soldier who fired it would have had to hold his 
aim on the target until the missile arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas Instruments/Martin Marietta version will use infrared seekers to 
guide the missile. A key difference from the Ford proposal is that TI/MM system 
would allow the soldier to seek cover before the missile reached its target.

ANDRAE CROUCH BRINGS POWER OF THE PULPIT TO POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Andrae Crouch's musical mission is to do the Lord's work, that hasn't 
precluded him from helping the lords of the pop charts do their work too. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran gospel-pop singer and his group brought the power of the pulpit to 
Michael Jackson's hit "Man in the Mirror" (the stirring gospel choir heard on 
the song, which is a Grammy nominee for Record of the Year, also includes the 
Winans, another notable pop-gospel act). 
</P>
<P>
And when Madonna's new single, "Like a Prayer," debuts next month, Crouch and 
his singers will be heard lending a taste of the sacred in support of this most 
secular of stars. 
</P>
<P>
"They respect me as one they enjoy in my particular kind of music," Crouch, who 
sings Monday night in a benefit concert at the Hop in El Toro, said recently 
from his home in Woodland Hills. "If they need us and we can contribute, we'll 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
But before committing his group to any pop star's project, Crouch asks to see 
the lyric sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to read the words first to make sure. We're trying to see if it 
goes against how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch, whose mainstream credits also include writing and arranging gospel 
songs heard on the sound track of "The Color Purple," said it doesn't bother 
him that the Madonna song will be part of a soda pop ad campaign. Actually, he 
said, his group won't be on the commercial's sound track: For reasons having to 
do with business and production procedures rather than ethics, the Crouch 
chorus's parts are being duplicated by other singers. But Crouch, 46, sees no 
ethical problem in rendering music unto the marketplace. If he had been asked 
to sing on the commercial, he said, he would not have turned down the offer out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes money to live," he said. "Bibles are not free." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Crouch has gotten used to criticism from some gospel purists 
who feel that even his religious message songs, because they are grounded in 
contemporary pop music styles, don't hew to appropriately holy ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't pay any attention to it anymore," Crouch said. "I'm free, and I play 
what God gives me to play. Our environment certainly affects us. Our music 
should expand. The message is the same, but there's no limit to the music." 
</P>
<P>
In pursuing new musical influences, Crouch doesn't restrict himself to 
sanctified precincts. For example, his 1981 song, "Hollywood Scene," is a 
lament of a young man's downfall and corruption that Crouch said was inspired 
by watching male street hustlers on Santa Monica Boulevard. Musically, the 
number resembles a Steely Dan production, with Crouch's husky baritone echoing 
the tone of Steely Dan's singer, Donald Fagen -- not exactly a noted source of 
gospel music. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians who come from church backgrounds always have had to deal with the 
tension between what's sacred and what's popular. Sam Cooke was one of the 
first gospel stars to become a pop singer, and he was reviled as a turncoat in 
some gospel quarters. Al Green and Aretha Franklin have straddled the same line 
during their careers. 
</P>
<P>
Crouch said he shared some purist beliefs in a firm separation between gospel 
and pop back in the early 1960s, when Aretha Franklin moved from church music 
to pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"When she first sang rock 'n' roll, it kind of (bothered) me a bit," he said. 
"It kind of hurt me. She was so powerful, and I thought I wouldn't be able to 
hear her sing songs that would really touch my heart. But now that I understand 
more, I still love her anyway. I don't see anything wrong in people singing pop 
music as long as it doesn't go against their beliefs and what I feel God's 
standard is. I think it's wrong when people turn it around to a purely sexual 
thing, or something that says nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Although appreciative of pop that is not exploitative, Crouch said he has never 
considered crossing the line himself and making pure pop without religious 
themes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was never even tempted that way," said Crouch, who got his start in music as 
a boy when, he says, his minister father prayed for him to receive the gift of 
music, on the condition that he would always use it for divine purposes. "I 
wanted to teach that gospel music and God's principle were good, so it 
shouldn't take a back seat" to pop. As for his collaborations with Michael 
Jackson and Madonna, Crouch said, "I don't look at it as a jumping board" into 
the pop market. "Of course, I want as many people to hear my music as possible, 
but I'm not going to compromise it to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Crouch's longstanding willingness to sing gospel music in pop settings makes it 
less surprising that he and his 11-member ensemble will be the headliners 
Monday for an evening billed as a " '50s Sweetheart Prom." 
</P>
<P>
The show, which includes dinner and dancing to a disc jockey spinning '50s 
hits, will benefit three causes: the Dean Miraldi Foundation, headed by a 
former Los Angeles Raiders football player who visits high schools to talk with 
students about moral and ethical issues; Concept 7, an organization that 
provides housing for abused children, and the social outreach programs of the 
Ocean Hills Community Church in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
"We have fun with music, so we might even kick off into something like (a '50s 
medley)," Crouch said. "Just having fun -- we've done that before." 
</P>
<P>
Andrae Crouch sings Monday in a " '50s Sweetheart Prom" benefit at the Hop, 
23822 Mercury Road, El Toro. Comedian-singer Jason Chase will open. The evening 
starts at 6:30 p.m.; tickets are $75 per person. Information: (714) 493-4020.

KDOC-TV PLANS NEWSCAST DESPITE LOSS OF CO-ANCHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the loss of a prospective anchorman, Anaheim-based TV station KDOC 
(Channel 56) will proceed with plans to launch "Newswatch," its first locally 
produced, 30-minute nightly newscast, by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to air at 8:30 weeknights beginning Feb. 27, the broadcast will be 
co-anchored by the station's news director, Michelle Merker, and a male 
co-anchor yet to be hired. 
</P>
<P>
Station officials had named Dennis Turner, a free-lance producer at Cable News 
Network, as Merker's on-camera partner. Turner, however, "became unavailable," 
station spokeswoman Sue Hooper said Friday. "No replacement has been named yet. 
But we are moving ahead full steam and we hope to name someone next week." 
</P>
<P>
Hooper said she does not know the details of the 11th-hour personnel change. 
She characterized the problem as "a temporary hitch" that would not delay the 
"Newswatch" air date. Merker could not be reached for comment "because she is 
interviewing candidates" to replace Turner, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Merker has anchored KDOC's news updates since 1983. She has also been the host 
of "Sound Off," a public affairs program, and other news reports at KDOC. 
</P>
<P>
The prime-time, nightly "Newswatch" will be the only commercial TV newscast 
originating from Orange County. Besides national and foreign coverage, the show 
will devote time on each broadcast to local stories. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have 'rip-and-read' inserts," Hooper said, alluding to Merker's 
headline updates between shows. "This is our first effort at a full-blown 
competitive newscast." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to define "full-blown," Hooper said the station will hire one field 
reporter along with the male co-anchor. "We'll add staff as we go," she said. 
"We want to establish a newsroom."

EVEN WITHOUT BILL HALEY, THE COMETS STILL ATTRACT '50S ROCK 'N' ROLL FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

John (Bam Bam) Lane had just been graduated from high school in Cumberland, 
Pa., when he answered a wantad for a drummer in a band in nearby Chester. 
</P>
<P>
He had to lie about his age -- the ad said applicants needed to be at least 21 
-- but he beat out 18 other drummers for the gig. "It wasn't until after I got 
the job," Lane said in a telephone interview this week, "that I found out it 
was with the Comets." 
</P>
<P>
As in Bill Haley and the Comets, backup band to a man who was among the first 
to combine R&amp;B, country and pop in such early '50s rock 'n' roll hits as 
"Rock Around the Clock" and "Shake, Rattle and Roll." 
</P>
<P>
Lane joined the group in 1967 and toured with Haley until the rock pioneer's 
death in 1981. The last of the original Comets left the group then, but Lane 
has been on the road with a new set of Comets ever since. The group will play 
Saturday at a benefit for the International Surf Museum of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In his early days with Haley, Lane toured about 10 months each year, including 
4 to 5 months overseas. "In Europe, we worked about every country there is," 
Lane said. Although Haley was rarely recognized on the streets of the United 
States, he was regularly mobbed in England and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, in the midst of a rock 'n' roll revival, Bill Haley and the Comets 
broke attendance records set by the Beatles and Rolling Stones at London's 
Royal Albert Hall, and through the late '60s Haley regularly was the headliner 
on European tours over bands such as the Spencer Davis Group. "That was one 
thing in Europe -- Bill was always the headliner," Lane said. "Even to this 
day, he is still No. 1 over there." 
</P>
<P>
Those early years were heady ones for the young drummer from Cumberland, who 
celebrated his 19th birthday in London, his 20th in Dublin and his 21st in 
Paris. Haley, he said, was friendly and mild-mannered, but always expected a 
professional attitude from his band. 
</P>
<P>
Haley scaled back his touring in 1977 and hit the road about twice a year until 
his death. The Comets keep touring, Lane said, to keep Haley's name alive and 
to satisfy his fans. They tour solo and also take part in '50s-revival package 
tours. 
</P>
<P>
Two Comets from the '60s -- Dave Linkous and Spider Webb -- recently rejoined 
the band, and three other members joined after Haley's death. The group 
performs songs from Haley's repertoire, along with other hits from the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"After Bill passed away, we didn't know how it was going to go," Lane said. But 
the public has responded: "We've had three and four generations of a family 
come to see the band. . . . It was really something that I didn't expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Haley's Comets will perform Saturday at 8 p.m. at Huntington Center, at 
Edinger Avenue and the San Diego Freeway. General admission tickets are $6 in 
advance, $7.50 at the door. There will be dancing, and '50s attire is 
encouraged. Information: (714) 897-2533.

FOLK SINGER CAROLYN HESTER IS BACK -- STILL FEISTY, FULL OF CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Carolyn Hester is one of the originals -- one of a small but determined gang of 
ragtag, early '60s folk singers who cruised the coffee shops and campuses, from 
Harvard Yard to Bleeker Street, convinced that their music could help change 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
The political and musical offspring of Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and the 
Weavers, performers such as Hester, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Tom Paxton, Richard 
Farina (to name only a very few) were among the vanguard of the new music of 
the '60s, the first surging energy of a wave that would eventually engulf a 
generation of American youth. 
</P>
<P>
Hester, who will perform at the Shade Tree in Laguna Niguel tonight, arrived in 
New York in the late '50s, a fresh-faced 18-year-old from Austin, Tex., who was 
determined to "become a folk singer." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take her long to become a player in a highly invigorating musical 
scene. "I made my first record," she recalled earlier this week, "for Coral, 
and I got it through the good graces of Buddy Holly. The next was on Tradition, 
and Tom Clancy, one of the Clancy Brothers, was my producer. 
</P>
<P>
"But the big breakthrough came when John Hammond of Columbia Records began to 
turn toward folk music. He had signed Pete Seeger, and there was a bunch of 
Pete's musical babies around -- me among them -- all in our early 20s. Al 
Grossman (who later became Janis Joplin's manager) took me to meet him, and 
Hammond signed me to make a record for Columbia." 
</P>
<P>
It was during the rehearsals for that first major label outing that Hester made 
a decision with implications that reached far beyond her own career. "I'd had 
my dad play harmonica on my first record, and I liked the sound. Richard Farina 
-- my husband at the time -- and I had run into Dylan at the Club 47 in Boston, 
and he was asking about places to play. So I thought, 'Why not use him to play 
harmonica on my album?' " 
</P>
<P>
Dylan was generally viewed by the folk-scene observers of the period as a 
Guthrie-influenced performer who was good, but hardly unusual. Hester heard 
something else. "It was magnetism," she said. "He hadn't written 'Blowin' in 
the Wind' or much of anything yet, but he was filled with magnetism." 
</P>
<P>
Hammond apparently had the same reaction. After attending a rehearsal for 
Hester's album, he quickly signed Dylan to his own recording contract. "One of 
the things I'm most proud of in my career," said Hester, with characteristic 
unselfishness, "is that I may have had something -- however small it was -- to 
do with his career getting started." 
</P>
<P>
Hester's own path led in another direction, however. By the late '60s, she was 
having record company problems and, unlike Dylan, felt uncomfortable with the 
increasing emphasis on electric music. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, she did not feel content just to sing about the disturbing 
events that she saw happening in the world. Holding hands in a recording studio 
to join in a chorus of praise for world peace was not, and is not, her idea of 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt," she said, "that I had to do something. For example, I went to 
Mississippi for the civil rights marches, not because I could help, but because 
I felt I should at least be a witness, even if I couldn't do anything to 
directly change things. That was what my conscience told me to do, and I didn't 
feel I could live in this country if I did otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"When Pete Seeger was banned from performing on television and Martin Luther 
King was killed -- I really think it had a lot to do with shattering our 
nerves, maybe even with disillusioning us about what we were doing. Eventually, 
we were replaced by performers who were either apolitical or were a little 
younger and a little more willing to focus on their own inner problems." 
</P>
<P>
Hester was largely retired from performing from the mid-'70s to the early '80s, 
her life centered on raising two young daughters. But attendance at the 
songwriter-oriented Kerrville Music Festival in Austin helped bring her back to 
making music in public again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting," she said, "how much things have changed, and yet how much 
they're still the same. When I go out now, I still meet the same gentle people 
I did before -- people who want acoustic music about subjects with a message. 
</P>
<P>
"My own perspective has changed over the years to a strong interest in 
ecological concerns. I've been looking a lot at what the native Americans have 
to say -- like the Hopi legend that the Indians are tending to Mother Earth, 
and if they get moved off the land so that people can have the mining rights, 
and so on, there'll be trouble for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's a message that certainly interests me. I tend to take that very 
seriously. And some of those concerns have begun to appear in my music. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a song called 'Warriors of the Rainbow,' " she continued, "in which I 
say that 'starvation's end would be complete, if the President, like an Indian 
chief, was always the last to eat.' I like that idea. The chief doesn't get to 
eat until the tribe's finished. Maybe we should try it -- don't let the 
President eat until all the hungry are fed." 
</P>
<P>
Hester's current programs are filled with similarly feisty points of view. 
</P>
<P>
"There comes a point when you look at the career you've had," she said with a 
smile, "and you say, 'Well, maybe that's all there's going to be.' So that's 
why it seems to be such a miracle that I've had the chance to get out and 
revitalize my music again. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us older performers get criticized for coming back to perform. But 
Dylan's still out there, and I know it means a lot to him to let the songs come 
out. Some people are just born musical-lifers. He seems to be -- and I guess 
maybe I am, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Hester performs at 8 p.m. at Shade Tree Stringed Instruments, 28062 
Forbes Road, Laguna Niguel. Admission: $7. Information: (714) 364-5270.
