THE LESSER NIXONIANA;

<P>
FROM: THE PRESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
RICHARD NIXON'S SECRET FILES EDITED BY BRUCE OUDES (HARPER &amp; ROW: $22.50; 
661 PP.)

By Stanley I. Kutler, Kutler teaches at the University of Wisconsin. His book 
on Nixon and Watergate will be published by Alfred A. Knopf this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Nixon has been the most visible political personality during the last 
four decades. Historians will long debate his role and achievements; Nixon 
undoubtedly will both fascinate and repel them, as he did his contemporaries. 
Most certainly, he will be noted in the history texts as the first (and, one 
hopes, the last) President of the United States to resign because of scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon also is unique in that following his resignation in 1974, Congress 
declared presidential papers public property, and provided they be made 
available, with proper limitations on national security, personal and family 
matters. For 13 years, Nixon resisted compliance with that law and fought to 
maintain control of what he insisted were "his papers." In one case, Justice 
John Paul Stevens called Nixon an "unreliable custodian" of his papers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1987, after the former President exhausted his appeals, the 
National Archives released 4 million of its holdings of more than 40 million 
pages. This volume contains approximately 1,000 documents, with maybe one-tenth 
written by Nixon himself. Apparently, the collection has as many memos by 
Charles Colson as by the President. 
</P>
<P>
"Secret Files" may amuse and titillate more than illuminate. The petty, 
vindicative thoughts of the President and his aides predominate; at other 
times, the subject matter is obscure or incomprehensible, except perhaps to 
scholars familiar with the details of the Nixon Administration. Too few 
documents provide "dramas of global significance," as the editor promised; 
instead, they are outweighed by "episodes of banality, baseness, and humor." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Oudes' introduction briefly assesses Nixon's career, but mainly focuses 
on the controversy surrounding his papers. Unfortunately, Oudes has offered 
little to guide and inform the reader about the authors or the meaning of 
various memoranda. For example, he has reprinted the "smoking gun" tape 
transcription (by now, a familiar item) from the June 23, 1972, Nixon-Haldeman 
conversations, yet the casual reader will find it difficult to decipher the 
heart of the Watergate cover-up in that seemingly cryptic, disjointed talk. A 
number of entries refer to the "5 o'clock Group." How many know that these 
White House aides met almost daily at that hour to decide how to "play" stories 
in the media? 
</P>
<P>
Documents are the raw material of history. But a presidential memo is not 
always historically significant. Indeed, most are trivial or repetitious, and 
this volume abounds in both. Documents must be shaped into a narrative of 
context, with analysis and explanation; otherwise they are meaningless and 
bewildering, as they often are here. 
</P>
<P>
The reader will struggle to find Nixon memoranda relating to substantive 
policies. Instead, the selections basically depict the ceaseless campaigner, 
ever-worried about capturing another vote, and insatiably tending to 
self-promotion and the "PR" aspects of his presidency. After he returned from 
China, Nixon bombarded his aides with memos about Panda bears, the public 
display of his gifts from Mao and how they should play the media regarding his 
successful dealings with Chinese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The first entry, written by Nixon two weeks before his inauguration in 1969, 
directed chief aide H. R. Haldeman to develop plans for collecting campaign 
funds for 1972. In the next few days, Nixon asked for an analysis of the 1968 
campaign, fretted about future leaks of information, demanded that aides audit 
the columns of unfriendly journalists and pursued the details of plans to 
celebrate the 10th anniversary of his famous "kitchen debate" with Nikita 
Khrushchev. The President-elect thus established a typical pattern for the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's admirers often point to him as a "hands-on" President. At the outset he 
instructed Haldeman "that I be informed as to what action has been taken and, 
if action is not taken, why the decision has been made not to take it." But 
endless memoranda regarding imagined enemies, the media and White House 
entertainment, or the preoccupation with Howard Hughes and the Kennedys, 
overshadow such nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Must we really know Nixon's musings regarding wine selections? Why include a 
three-page Haldeman memo on Mrs. Nixon's choices for films at Camp David? Or a 
secretary's note to Colson, merely noting the attachment of a transcript from a 
Gary Hart press conference? Given the editor's fascination with memos relating 
to Colson's questionable political dealings, he should have explained why the 
President, in a letter to Colson, spoke of June 3, 1974, as a "terribly sad and 
difficult" day. Indeed it was -- for Colson had just been sentenced for 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
(Colson, incidentally, derided George Bush's losing effort against Lloyd 
Bentsen in 1970. Bush, Colson complained, had resisted negative ads, "ignored 
the social issue and tried to be more liberal than Bentsen.") 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon Archives are striking for the comparatively few Nixon papers 
available for the period after his key aides, Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, 
resigned in April, 1973. Oudes has noted this discrepancy, and thus can provide 
only 30 pages to the tumultuous year of 1973, and merely three Nixon notes for 
1974 -- the most familiar, and probably most interesting, period. (Alexander 
Haig, Haldeman's successor, managed to remove most of his papers from the 
Administration records; they might well reveal more of this crucial time.) The 
dearth of Nixon material for the height of the Watergate crisis probably 
indicates the extent of the President's intense private preoccupation with the 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the lack of documents serves Nixon in his final campaign, a 
campaign that minimizes Watergate and maximizes his policy achievements. In 
1974, he predicted that Watergate would only be "a footnote in history." In 
1988, he characterized Watergate as a "small thing," echoing the line of his 
press aide in June, 1972, when he dismissed the break-in as a "third-rate 
burglary." 
</P>
<P>
Egil Krogh, the head of the "Plumbers," who served the President with another 
illegal break-in, and John Mitchell, Nixon's attorney general, knew that 
Watergate was more. Krogh acknowledged that the Plumbers had struck at the very 
basis of individual freedom, and Mitchell noted that Watergate included the 
"White House horrors" that had permeated Nixon's first term. Appropriately, the 
House Judiciary Committee and a good part of this nation concluded in the 
summer of 1974 that "Watergate" involved a consistent pattern of presidential 
abuses of power and obstruction of justice, and thus left Nixon with the 
unhappy choice of resignation or impeachment. "Secret Files" offers some 
glimpses into that "underside" of the Nixon Administration, but barely hints at 
the agony attending its fall. "Footnote" indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon resigned in part because of his role in the Watergate cover-up. 
Ironically, he and his aides left a wide documentary trail that exposed those 
misdeeds. Those records will provide future historians with a rich lode of 
material to elaborate that story, as well as the positive achievements of the 
Nixon Administration.

THE LETTERS OF HENRY ADAMS; 
</P>
<P>
VOLUMES IV-VI, 1892-1918 EDITED BY J.C. LEVENSON, ERNEST SAMUELS, CHARLES 
VANDERSEE AND VIOLA HOPKINS WINNER (BELKNAP PRESS/HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: 
$150 FOR THREE-VOLUME SET; VOL. IV, 736 PP.; VOL. V, 726 PP.; VOL. VI, 861 PP.,

<TEXT>
<P>
I can think of no better way to pass the time as we await the arrival of a new 
century than to read these letters of Henry Adams, who watched with great 
interest and trepidation the passing of the 19th Century and the arrival of the 
20th. The grandson of one president, great-grandson of another, living across 
Lafayette Square from the White House but constantly traveling the world, an 
observer and occasional behind-the-scenes influence but never an active 
participant in government affairs, Adams had a unique view of the events of his 
time. His "Education of Henry Adams" is perhaps the most brilliant intellectual 
autobiography in American literature. 
</P>
<P>
These letters to women friends, to nieces and brothers, to artists, scientists 
and statesmen and to many other friends and relatives, provide an insight into 
Adams' thoughts as his "Education" and its companion volume "Mont-Saint-Michel 
and Chartres" began to take shape. They reveal his passionate curiosity about 
unfolding events, his never-ending desire to find meaning in history and his 
sometimes astonishing power of prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
The first three volumes (published in 1982) of this six-volume set cover the 
years 1858-1891. The newly published, latter three volumes begin in 1892 and 
end a few days before his death at age 80, in March, 1918. More accessible than 
some of Adams' published writings, they provide perceptive commentary on all 
the momentous events of the period: the Panic of 1893, the Spanish-American and 
Boer wars, William Jennings Bryan and the silver question, the Administrations 
of Cleveland, McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, the sinking of the Lusitania and 
the beginnings of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
By far the greatest number of letters are to Elizabeth Cameron, the beautiful 
woman nearly 20 years his junior to whom he grew increasingly attached after 
his wife's suicide in 1885. According to Adams' biographer, Ernest Samuels, 
their relationship was apparently quite proper, in spite of gossip. She was the 
wife of Pennsylvania Sen. J. Donald Cameron and the niece of Sen. John Sherman 
(of the Sherman Antitrust Act) and Gen. William T. Sherman. Adams was usually 
quite restrained in indicating his feelings for her, but because of her 
intelligence and awareness of social and political power plays, he seems to 
have found her an ideal confidant. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' letters to Mrs. Cameron from Washington are, as the editors say, "the 
best court gossip an American has ever recorded." He wrote about the small 
dinners he attended at the Roosevelt White House and of what he had learned 
about the latest in national and international affairs when he entertained his 
friends the John Hays, the Henry Cabot Lodges, foreign diplomats and others in 
places of power. When he was away from Washington, she was his best informant. 
"Madame de Pompadour," he called her. "You are the only person who sees people 
and the world. You alone have the instinct, and take the trouble, and do the 
work." The same could be said of Adams himself. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' admiration for women, but regret at their wasted energies, is one of the 
themes in his letters that foreshadow passages in the "Education." In the 
chapter titled "Vis Inertiae (1903)," for example, he called contemporary 
American women a "failure." They had been set free, thanks to the greatly 
increased expenditure of artificial energy on their households, but their own 
potential energy was being wasted. As he wrote to a woman friend in 1905 while 
the "Education" was in progress, the American woman "has held nothing together, 
neither State nor Church, nor Society nor Family." To young George Cabot Lodge, 
however, he predicted that woman "is only beginning her career. . . . What will 
please her a century hence is a fascinating subject of reflection. . . . A 
branch of the sex is sure to break off as an emancipated social class. If I 
were beginning again as a writer, I think I should drop the man, except as an 
accessory, and study the woman of the future." 
</P>
<P>
Energies and forces, whether social, political or physical, are a major theme 
in Adams' letters, as in his published work. "Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres" 
explores the unity of religious belief during the Middle Ages as the force 
behind the building of the great Gothic cathedrals, while the "Education" is 
concerned with the multiplicity of energies that fragment the modern world. The 
contrast between the two periods especially impressed him, as he told various 
correspondents, when he went from Paris to Washington. Summers in Paris he was 
"living in the 12th Century," making daily excursions into the countryside to 
attend services at Chartres and "collect" spires and stained-glass windows. In 
the winter he returned to Washington and the 20th Century, amazed at finding 
himself in a "hundred-mile-an-hour country" whose rising power in the world 
astounded him. 
</P>
<P>
To his brother, Brooks, whose "Law of Civilization and Decay" (published in 
1895) was an important influence on his own work, he wrote about his interest 
in physics, which had been stimulated by studying the dynamos at the Paris 
Exposition of 1900, and of his efforts to calculate accelerating rates of 
energy consumption. Henry was convinced that at the rate the world was 
developing its power resources, it would "break its neck" in 30 years or so. 
"My belief is that science is to wreck us, and that we are like monkeys 
monkeying with a loaded shell; we don't in the least know or care where our 
practically infinite energies come from or will bring us to." 
</P>
<P>
By 1909, Adams had begun to study the writings of William Thompson, Lord 
Kelvin, on whose Second Law of Thermodynamics Adams hoped to build a scientific 
theory of history. His 1910 "Letter to American Teachers of History," intended 
to shake up members of the profession whom he believed were "dead as dormice," 
was a classic statement of fin-de-siecle pessimism. In it Adams proposed that 
thought, like other forms of energy, would gradually become dissipated. 
Civilization was declining, not progressing upward as the social Darwinists had 
been claiming. "Kelvin was a great man," he wrote to a friend in 1909, "and I 
am sorry I did not know enough mathematics to follow him instead of Darwin who 
led us all wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Reading the letters makes one feel a part of the time; it is a painless way to 
read history. The editors have supplied excellent introductions, which give the 
reader an overview of Adams' activities. The notes are always helpful, although 
those that first identify a correspondent may be in an earlier volume and are 
sometimes hard to find. Identifying notes from volumes one to three are not 
repeated in these later volumes. There are good indexes in volumes three and 
six, covering the contents of the first and second series of letters, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The letters will be especially useful to scholars, but they can be read with 
great enjoyment by anyone who makes a little effort to learn the cast of 
characters. Adams is never dull. His witty, ironic style often amuses, even 
when he is discussing apocalyptic events. His perceptive observations on the 
beginnings of the 20th Century give us, looking back on it, a new understanding 
of what we have been through.

As terrorism increases around the world, so it seems to have surged as the 
theme of prime-time TV productions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro," a new TV movie airing Monday at 9 p.m. on 
NBC, is the latest example. It recounts the 1985 terrorist takeover of a luxury 
cruise ship in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malden and Lee Grant play the pivotal roles as wheelchair-bound Leon 
Klinghoffer and his wife, Marilyn. They were among the American passengers 
asserting themselves against the four terrorists, who ultimately took the life 
of Leon Klinghoffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident," says Grant, "shocked the world because of the terrorists' 
brutality. They tried to strip the hostages of their humanity but were instead 
faced with defiance." 
</P>
<P>
"The passengers, inspired by the personal strength of the Klinghoffers and 
other Americans," she added, "refused to surrender their dignity. It was a very 
human triumph." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the cast of writer-director Robert Collins' movie are Vera Miles, E.G. 
Marshall, Christina Pickles and Susan Lyons.

THE LAST NIP OF VAMPIRE DE DIP; 
</P>
<P>
NATURAL HISTORY BY JOAN PERUCHO; TRANSLATED FROM THE CATALAN BY DAVID H. 
ROSENTHAL (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $17.95; 208 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jean Franco, Franco is a professor of Spanish and Portuguese literature at 
Columbia University.

<TEXT>
<P>
Vampires have come a long way since 1897 when Bram Stoker published "Dracula." 
There have been rock 'n' roll vampires, stand-up comic vampires, romantic 
vampires and now in Joan Perucho's "Natural History," a Catalan vampire with 
political convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the Spain of the 1830s when liberal forces in support of Queen Isabel II 
and her mother, Maria Cristina, were fighting off a challenge from the 
pretender, Don Carlos, the novel describes a vampire hunt in war-torn 
Catalonia. The protagonist is the young liberal aristocrat and naturalist, 
Antoni de Montpalau, who has passion for collecting and classifying odd species 
and for whom even the common goat goes by the name of Capra Hispanica. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has no belief in the supernatural and dismisses his cousin Isidre 
Novau's claim to have sighted the famous pesce cola as "nothing more than a 
hallucination caused by excessive ingestion of canned food," Montpalau's calm 
positivism is frequently disrupted -- by the auguries of bats in flight, crazy 
bulls, a mysterious assassination attempt and puffs of smoke that take on 
unusual shapes. 
</P>
<P>
And as inevitably as Sherlock Holmes is lured by the Hound of the Baskervilles, 
Montpalau is drawn to the village of Pratdip where every morning somebody is 
found dead with blood drained from the body and two small holes in the neck. 
Braving bandits and war and laden with garlic, Montpalau and his cousin Isidre 
make their way to Pratdip, which is dominated by a ruined castle, surrounded by 
a "veritable orgy of wild mushrooms, goats, partridges, lettuce and emeralds." 
Here they are met by the baroness d'Urpi and her daughter, Agnes, with whose 
help Montpalau identifies the vampire as 700-year-old Onofre de Dip who had 
been seduced by a Romanian vampire duchess but had returned to Catalonia out of 
nostalgia for his native land. 
</P>
<P>
Although Montpalau saves Pratdip from further devastation, Onofre escapes 
destruction and resurfaces as a Carlist guerrilla known as the Owl. He is 
naturally drawn to the cause of authoritarian monarchism but paradoxically 
feeds on the Carlist Gen. Cabrera and tries to turn him into a vampire. 
Captured by Cabrera's forces, Montpalau providentially saves the general by 
feeding him garlic water and, when the Carlist forces are defeated, gallantly 
helps him escape to France. With the defeat, the Dip also gives himself up, 
weary of his 700 years of wandering and Montpalau marries Agnes to the music of 
Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
"Natural History" is, as this summary is intended to suggest, not so much a 
vampire novel as a diverting spoof of historical novels and travel literature. 
The cameo appearance of historical characters like Gen. Prat, Frederic Chopin 
and George Sand reminds us of the way historical novels often pass off 
improbable fictions by giving them underpinnings of historical fact. In 
"Natural History," these historical encounters coexist with bizarre fantasies 
like the discoveries of a large phallus impudicus, of giant fleas and of human 
beings turned to stone. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit of the Dip into the mountains of Catalonia allows the author to 
parody travel literature, the writings of geologists and naturalists, 
18th-Century treatises on the improvement of agriculture, the legends that 
surround all shrines to the Virgin, and the populist reverence for folklore. 
</P>
<P>
The novel is thus a diverting collection of pastiches -- of royal 
proclamations, popular songs, proverbs and most amusingly those travel books 
whose authors take delight in impassively consuming whatever exotic dish the 
peasantry prepares for them. Thus Montpalau and Novau eat a dish "invented by 
lower Aragon's transhuman shepherd" and which consists of "lamb tripe wound 
around oak branches and roasted over an open fire. Part of its excellence 
derived from the way it crunched between one's teeth, but its most exquisite 
and refined peculiarity was that it still contained the beast's excrement." The 
index of the novel is a comic masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
In the introduction to the novel, the translator (who does an excellent job) 
describes "Natural History" as a Bildungsroman whose hero is transformed from a 
positivist to a man who is forced to accept fantasy. But the novel is more 
subversive and irreverent than this interpretation would suggest. The author, 
Joan Perucho, is a poet, novelist and art critic whose first book was published 
by the literary underground in 1947 when it was dangerous to publish in Catalan 
since Franco had made the language illegal. Post-Franco Spain not unnaturally 
witnessed a resurgence of Catalan and there are now Catalan radio stations, 
television channels and daily newspapers. It is in this light that we can read 
"Natural History" as an irreverent bricolage of all those contradictory 
elements -- legend and science, folklore and history -- that have gone into the 
making of the "imaginary" community of Catalonia. The humor and parody enhance 
our sense of that land's delightful idiosyncrasy. Catalonia, after all, 
produced both Antonio Gaudi and Pablo Picasso.

After watching the newly extended "Home" program, I've decided to express my 
opinion. I am disappointed as to how it has changed. Those things that made the 
show a success just aren't there anymore, such as the information on improving 
one's home or creative ideas for one's hobbies. Seems as if "Home" has become 
just another talk show. Also, Sandy Hill was a wonderful hostess and I think 
Cristina Ferrare should have stayed on "AM."

Thanks, NBC, for the exciting miniseries, "Brotherhood of the Rose." I had 
thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel and looked forward to the TV adaptation. I 
was not disappointed. Great acting and a well-chosen cast combined to make the 
characters in the book come to life.

A dramatization of the life of the co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous will 
feature the reteaming of James Garner and James Woods, who won acclaim for 
their portrayal of brothers in the TV movie "Promise." Like that film, this one 
will be presented under the "Hallmark Hall of Fame" banner. To be broadcast on 
ABC, "My Name is Bill W." features Woods as Bill Wilson and Garner as Dr. Bob 
Smith. JoBeth Williams plays Woods' wife. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Wagner, the former star of "The Bionic Woman," plays a woman who could 
use some bionic powers in "From the Dead of Night," a four-hour movie that NBC 
plans to broadcast Feb. 27-28. It's about a fashion designer who is being 
pursued by six "beings" from "the other side." Also in the cast are Bruce 
Boxleitner, Diahann Carroll, Robin Thomas and Robert Prosky. 
</P>
<P>
ABC has set Feb. 19 and 21 as the telecast dates for "Passion and Paradise," a 
new TV drama about murder in the Bahamas. Rod Steiger plays the victim, a 
millionaire. Mariette Hartley portrays his wife, Catherine Mary Stewart plays 
their daughter and Armand Assante plays the daughter's romantic interest. Wayne 
Rogers co-stars as the detective who investigates the case. 
</P>

Andrea Martin and Martin Short, who used to work together on the "SCTV" series,

John Sayles, who wrote and directed the film "Eight Men Out," has written a 
pilot movie for NBC called "Shannon's Deal." It stars Jamey Sheridan as "a 
gritty Philadelphia lawyer who tries to make justice happen where often there 
has been none." Also on hand are Elizabeth Pena, Eddie Velez, Jenny Lewis and 
Miguel Ferrer.

<P>
Debbie Reynolds will play what NBC describes as a fading movie star in "Perry 
Mason: The Case of the Final Curtain." Reynolds' character is appearing in a 
musical when the show's director is killed. Joining Raymond Burr and Barbara 
Hale in the cast are Alexandra Paul and William R. Moses.

In all the thousands of hours of TV I've watched over the years, I don't 
believe I've ever seen a show quite as extraordinary as "The Singing

PERESTROIKA 
</P>
<P>
New Thinking for Our Country and the World by Mikhail Gorbachev (A Cornelia and 
Michael Bessie Book / Harper &amp; Row: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
Mikhail Gorbachev's remarkable manifesto "Perestroika" (or restructuring) 
criticizes the "hard legacy of stagnation" of the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Parallel with the democratization of society, radical economic reform is the 
groundwork of our entire perestroika," reads the Resolution of the 19th 
All-Union Conference of the CPSU included in this new edition. "New democratic 
methods of leadership, openness and glasnost find it hard to make their way, 
coming up against conservatism, inertia and dogmatism in thinking and society." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, "there can be no revolutionary restructuring without invigorating 
in every way the intellectual and cultural potential of society." 
</P>
<P>
One of the dictums in this edition's "On Combating Bureaucracy" takes 
independent thinking to new limits: "Satire, as a weapon against . . . 
manifestations of bureaucratic attitudes, . . . should be used to full 
measure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM 
</P>
<P>
The Civil War Era by James M. McPherson (Ballantine Books: $14.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing directly from the official records of the Union and Confederate armies 
as well as the diaries of leaders and soldiers published more than a century 
ago, James M. McPherson vividly recaptures a soldier's thoughts during the 
Civil War as well as extensively delineating the war's numerous "dynamic 
transformations." 
</P>
<P>
"We heard all through the war that the army 'was eager to be led against the 
enemy,' " a Union soldier wrote about the fighting at Antietam. "The truth is, 
when bullets are whacking against tree-trunks and solid shots are cracking 
skulls like egg-shells, the consuming passion . . . of the average man is to 
get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Most compelling is McPherson's well-supported thesis that "at numerous critical 
points during the war things might have gone altogether differently." Even as 
late as 1864, the North came to the brink of peace negotiations -- that is, 
until the capture of Atlanta and the destruction of the South's army in the 
Shenandoah Valley "clinched matters for the North." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE IMMORTAL BARTFUSS 
</P>
<P>
by Aharon Appelfeld; translated from the Hebrew by Jeffrey M. Green (Perennial 
Library / Harper &amp; Row: $7.95) 
</P>
<P>
 A Holocaust survivor and now a moneylender in Jaffa, Bartfuss has little 
patience for words or conversation; he avoids or ignores old acquaintances, and 
is unable to sleep. He even hates his own wife, a fellow survivor of the death 
camps, for her voluble reaffirmation of life. 
</P>
<P>
But his solitary life is shaken when real illness strikes him. 
</P>
<P>
Only then does Bartfuss begin to show some emotion: He apologizes to a man whom 
he had beaten physically; he genuinely mourns the death of a lover. But his 
sexuality takes an unhealthy turn when he grows attracted to his own retarded 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Aharon Appelfeld writes sparingly, obliquely in this brief novel, justly 
rendering the shell of a damaged man who regains in the end some semblance of 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAYER AND THALBERG 
</P>
<P>
The Make-Believe Saints by Samuel Marx (Samuel French: $12.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Introductions like Samuel Marx's into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios generally 
only happen on the movie screen. Marx accidentally ran into Irving Thalberg, 
whom he had known at Universal Pictures, on 54th Street in New York. Thalberg 
was now production head of MGM and said in passing, "Why don't you try screen 
writing? . . . Come to the coast." A few months later Marx did just that. 
</P>
<P>
"If you'd shown up yesterday, I'd have given you an assignment and forgotten 
about you. If you'd arrived tomorrow, the position would have been filled," 
Thalberg tells Marx when the studio guard finally lets him through. The story 
editor at MGM had just resigned and Marx was to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
Marx was story editor from 1930 to 1936, then a producer, working for MGM on 
and off for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Of Louis B. Mayer, Marx writes: "The truth about Mayer doesn't come easily. 
Without doubt he was violent when roused, ruthless when crossed, a battler 
often without pity. . . . But he had another dimension." Marx's treatment of 
Thalberg, a younger man with whose death at 36 the book concludes, is equally 
balanced. 
</P>
<P>
As Wayne Warga wrote in his review for The Times in 1975, "Marx substitutes 
reportage for veneration and he gets right to the point. That he also is candid 
is simply an added benefit of this carefully written history." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHATTERTON 
</P>
<P>
by Peter Ackroyd (Ballantine Books: $8.95) 
</P>
<P>
The brief, tragic life of Thomas Chatterton was the inspiration for works by 
such Romantic poets as Keats and Wordsworth. Best known for a literary hoax 
(Chatterton counterfeited a series of poems by an imaginary 15th-Century monk), 
Chatterton's own writings never found a publisher, and at 18 he killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Chatterton and his forgery haunt Peter Ackroyd's novel as well. The opening 
section is set in contemporary London, where Charles Wychwood discovers that 
Chatterton had forged his own death and in fact lived on to write the poems 
attributed to William Blake and others. Another portion of the book tells of a 
different kind of forgery, as George Wallis paints "The Death of Chatterton" 
using the poet George Meredith as his model. 
</P>
<P>
"At the heart of Ackroyd's novel is a deeply serious concern with art, its 
relationship to the artist and to 'reality,' " Paul D. Sheats wrote in these 
pages.

ENDPAPERS: OXFORD FOR COMPANY, CAMBRIDGE TO GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Call it, if you like, the Battle of the Two Margarets: Drabble took the field 
first, with the 1985 fifth edition of "The Oxford Companion to English 
Literature"; enter now Atwood, with the late 1988 first edition of "The 
Cambridge Guide to Literature in English." Actually, Margaret Atwood only 
contributes the foreword to the Cambridge book, which has been edited by Ian 
Ousby; Margaret Drabble is Oxford's Ousby. But call it the Battle of the Two 
Margarets anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Now then, which Margaret wins? 
</P>
<P>
Let the two thick volumes fall open to the middle. They are about the same 
size. Cambridge's 1,109 pages are fewer but a bit larger than Oxford's 1,155. 
Both, for the record, are bound well enough and printed on good enough paper 
that they do indeed fall open and lie quietly at the page the reader is 
consulting. On this last point, Cambridge gets the nod, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
With both books open in the middle, try a few sample mid-book entries in 
Cambridge: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Le Guin, Ursula, the distinguished author of "anthropological" science 
fiction, resident in Northern California: 36 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Le Sueur, Meridel, the early radical feminist writer, who began in New 
York, living in a commune with Emma Goldman, but did some of her most important 
writing in Hollywood: 28 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Magic Realism, a school of writing mainly identified with South American 
writers, above all with Gabriel Garcia Marquez: 80 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Malouf, David, one of Australia's most serious novelists and poets: 43 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Maltz, Albert, the late playwright and screenwriter, whom many would call 
the most talented of the Hollywood 10: 20 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mamet, David, younger American playwright, author of "American Buffalo" and 
other works: 14 lines. 
</P>
<P>
What does Oxford have to say of these? With the exception of Magic Realism, a 
phrase it says was coined by Franz Roh in 1925 for an exhibit of 
post-Expressionist German art and only later used to characterize a current in 
Latin American literature, Oxford has no entries on any of these. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, from the same middle section, one may easily compile a list of Oxford 
entries unmatched by Cambridge, among them: Maeterlinck, Maimonides and 
Mandelstam. 
</P>
<P>
How to explain this difference? Oxford is the revision of the original 
"Companion," edited by Sir Paul Harvey in 1932. Margaret Drabble explains a key 
regard in which she continues Harvey's approach: 
</P>
<P>
"The coverage of foreign authors has been dictated largely by Harvey's own 
criterion; they are included 'as matter of allusion in English, not on any 
scale of merit which would satisfy students of those literatures.' A few have 
made their way on merit alone, but most have been treated in the context of 
English literature. In the entries for American authors, emphasis has been 
placed on Anglo-American connections and responses: The selection for 
contemporary American authors has been partly guided by British appraisals, 
which sometimes differ considerably from those current in the United States, 
although indisputably major figures have been included as a matter of course. 
There has been no attempt to provide comprehensive coverage of Commonwealth 
literature, although many individual new entries have been added." 
</P>
<P>
It is important to note that this criterion dictates not just exclusions but 
also inclusions, such as that of Maeterlinck, Maimonides and Mandelstam, none 
of whom is from England, America or the Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge approach is strikingly different, as editor Ian Ousby explains: 
</P>
<P>
"This volume aims to provide a handy reference guide to the literature in 
English produced by all the various English-speaking cultures. Its scope thus 
extends beyond the United Kingdom and Ireland to represent also the U.S.A., 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, India and the Caribbean. . . . Because 
of this very broad range, it has been necessary to restrict the consideration 
of non-English literature which sometimes creeps into such guides." Or as 
Margaret Atwood a bit more exuberantly puts it: "Perhaps we should say 'the 
English languages,' since, being a viral organism, English has mutated, 
producing many variants which share its main characteristics but which have 
diverged to become species recognizable in their own right. Thus novels by, for 
instance, William Faulkner, Chinua Achebe or Anita Desai may contain words and 
even grammatical constructions which are foreign to readers from the British 
Isles; American English may sound strange to an Australian, West Indian English 
to a Canadian; yet each of these 'Englishes' can be read by any English 
speaker, who, by virtue of common ground, is in a position to make at least an 
educated guess at understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The Battle of the Two Margarets is thus a draw. For the reading of the 
literature that was written in English during the centuries when the influence 
of other European literatures on English writers vastly exceeded that of other 
literatures in English, Oxford is a boon companion. For the reading of the 
literature that is being and will be written in the newer, non-European 
English-speaking cultures, Cambridge is an indispensable and indeed a 
path-breaking guide. Oxford, at $35, is a bargain. Cambridge, at $39.50 -- not 
a new edition but a completely new work -- is an even better bargain. Buy both, 
or at the very least, insist that your local library do so.

OUTTAKES: DOG DAYS FOR MIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stacy Jenel Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember Mike the Dog of "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" fame? He just flew 
from L.A. to Toronto first class on Air Canada to shoot a commercial for 
Nestle's Grand Gourmet dog food. Total cost of the round-trip for Mike, two 
trainers and his furry stand-in: $12,780, plus tax! 
</P>
<P>
According to a source involved in arranging Mike's trip, the airline industry 
is nervous over Zsa Zsa Gabor's current $10-million dog-related legal snarl 
with Delta Airlines (in January, she was asked to leave a Delta jet because she 
wouldn't put her two small dogs in cages, and she's filed a lawsuit). 
Regulations ordinarily prohibit a dog Mike's size from traveling in the 
passenger section, airline sources told us, and special dispensation in such 
cases is becoming less common. 
</P>
<P>
Someone suggested stashing Mike in cargo, but trainer Clint Rowe wouldn't allow 
it ("Mike's too old (11) and too special for that"). 
</P>
<P>
So to fly Mike, who returns today, Canada's MacLaren Lintas advertising firm 
had to book the entire first-class cabin, both ways. 
</P>
<P>
As for Mike's career, he's also just wrapped two international Coke 
commercials. But filmwise, it's a sad tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I did with him after the movie was a disappointment," Rowe 
admitted. "The ('Down and Out in Beverly Hills' TV) series was a bomb. A pilot 
we did called 'Mutts' was a bomb. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Rowe said he now has a completed script and pending deal for Mike. 
</P>
<P>
The flop-eared canine, however, faces new competition: Rowe is currently 
handling Beasley, a French mastiff, on Touchstone's Tom Hanks starrer, "Turner 
and Hooch" (as well as Beasley's stunt double, Igor). Beasley portrays the 
title pooch named Hooch, "a big, bad junkyard dog who's disgusting, dirty and 
mean and gradually becomes friends with Tom (who plays Turner)." 
</P>
<P>
But Mike remains Rowe's top dog: "He's my real dream, my shining star." Stacy 
Jenel Smith

OUTTAKES: A LEAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pat H. Broeske 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
British director David Lean -- notoriously reticent -- has finally cooperated 
on a book about his life and films (the two-time Oscar winner is now 80). 
Titled simply "David Lean," it's due out in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Stephen M. Silverman not only got Lean to participate -- the oversize 
hard-cover book even includes Lean's baby pictures -- but also reached dozens 
of Lean colleagues. Katharine Hepburn, who delivered one of her most famous 
performances in Lean's 1955 pic "Summertime," wrote the intro and provided 
personal photos. 
</P>
<P>
Silverman saw Lean's 1962 epic, "Lawrence of Arabia," at age 11, "and my life 
changed -- no movie since has lived up to that experience." 
</P>
<P>
The former film columnist for the New York Post proposed the book to Lean over 
dinner one night in London. "When he said, 'fine,' my jaw dropped," Silverman 
told us. "I almost said, 'My God, have you ever seen the New York Post?' I 
immediately promised him that it would be impeccably done, a labor of love. 
</P>
<P>
"And he said, 'Well, don't labor too much.' " Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: HEAVEN CAN'T WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC Entertainment prez Brandon Tartikoff turned the promotion down, so the 
network's daytime programming veep, Brian Frons, took it: Frons will play God 
on an episode of "Santa Barbara" to air Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario: Cowboy Sonny Sprocket (played by Lane Davies) is about to marry 
opportunist Gina Timmons (Robin Mattson) when he's gunned down by a hit man 
(Abe Vigoda). Sprocket has an out-of-body experience, lands in heaven and runs 
into, among others, the Almighty Himself. 
</P>
<P>
The TV monitors there bear GBC (God's Broadcasting Co.) logos with peacocks and 
halos; there are even copies of Celestial Variety laying around. 
</P>
<P>
Head writer Chuck Pratt said Tartikoff was the first choice of the producers 
("God (should) be a network executive and heaven would be a system of owned and 
operated clouds"). Tartikoff reportedly had scheduling problems -- his office 
said he had no comment -- and Frons, 32, got the nod. 
</P>
<P>
He'll get scale -- $500 -- for his day's work. Sue Facter

Regarding "Dressing Well Is the Best Revenge," by Karen Stabiner (Dec. 11): For 
the past 45 years I have lived and worked in Beverly Hills. My friends are 
people dedicated to various charitable, cultural and political causes. We have 
tried to teach our children sensitivity for others in an attempt to counter the 
"hedonist" image we have as a community. 
</P>
<P>
Your vacuous piece on Wanda McDaniel and Armani was an embarrassment to us as a 
community.

<P>
As I have read about the "Project X" controversy, I have become more and more 
curious about how animals that work in movies are treated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles Times Magazine, Vicki Hearne's story was "The 
Trainers' Side of the Controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Now, I would like to hear the other side.

The "Project X" scandal opened the door on cruelty to animals in entertainment. 
It is only a matter of time before the next bomb, similar to "Project X," 
explodes in the faces of the trainers and the American Humane Assn. The 
Coalition to Protect Animals in Entertainment is on the alert to set up a 
boycott of the next movie in which animals are abused. We are going to convince 
producers that it is box-office suicide to abuse animals in their productions.

I wish Hearne hadn't given the impression, even unintentionally, to people who 
will never in any other way hear of him, that Descartes campaigned for 
vivisection ("He held that animals are unconscious mechanisms that only appear 
to feel and think. . . . On that view, even nailing a dog to a board and 
cutting his chest open without anesthesia is not cruel. . . ."). But thank you 
for the article. If I'm lucky enough to have another dog I'll go about what's 
between him and me more intelligently. I do have a old horse I treat kindly. 
I'll tell her what you said, about how she ought to be given her chance to be 
proud -- still.

POPLINE: THEY MIGHT BE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attention all employers: If you've been noticing the mysterious number (718) 
387-6962 popping up increasingly on those office phone bills, wonder no more. 
It's the Dial-a-Song service of They Might Be Giants. For four years the skewed 
rock duo from New Jersey has been offering callers a new song on the line each 
day, publicizing the number with the added enticement that the service is, of 
course, "free if you call from work." 
</P>
<P>
For most fans, one song a day won't do. Addiction-prone members of what is 
referred to in song as "the exploited working class" are increasingly spending 
their own hard-earned dollars on They Might Be Giants. Neither of the duo's two 
albums is on a major label; both -- including the recent "Lincoln" -- are 
selling in the six-figure range. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers -- and mainstream media attention like guest shots with David 
Letterman and rave reviews in People magazine -- aren't bad for an outfit that 
has labored under an image as an East Coast intellectual novelty band. 
</P>
<P>
That peg isn't groundless, given songs like "Youth Culture Killed My Dog," "Ana 
Ng" (their latest alternative-radio hit) and "Kiss Me, Son of God" in which 
absurdity is the means of bridging comedy and tragedy. Still, the two 
singer/songwriters see the substance of their bizarre power-pop blend as less 
jokey than "obsessively personal," if "lumpy and strange and hard to defend." 
</P>
<P>
"The whole humor thing is sort of our cross to bear," admitted John Flansburgh, 
partner of John Linnell, from his New Jersey home. "We especially flinch when 
people say that we're comic. I feel like people will go into a coma if you talk 
about humor in what you're doing. It's like hearing Jerry Lewis on some talk 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"But I do think we find as songwriters that using wordplay and having a lighter 
touch actually helps us deal with issues that might actually be way too heavy 
to deal with in a direct way, because without that element of lightness it just 
would be considered absolutely moaning-and-groaning music." 
</P>
<P>
Plus: "The other thing that's good about having humor in your music is that 
it's actually funny." Check. 
</P>
<P>
Some record industry types might find it funny that the duo has thus far 
resisted what Flansburgh calls "the whole devil temptation of rock" and stayed 
true to its minimalist roots -- still using tapes in lieu of a live rhythm 
section, and still putting a new song each day on the answering machine in 
Flansburgh's living room. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact someone just called in. Did I tell you I got a machine that counts the 
number of calls coming in? It was really a shock, because I never really knew 
before how many people actually called, and there are days when it's around 
300. It's really phenomenal. I mean, we make records now, so it's not like you 
can't go get it." Chris Willman

POPLINE: MIDGE URE WRITES A 'DEAR GOD' LETTER; A SONG ON THE LINE FROM THEY 
MIGHT BE GIANTS; TRACIE SPENCER, 13, A REAL TEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pop radio has suddenly become a prime medium for addressing deity. First there 
was XTC's less-than-reverent "Dear God," a hostile open letter to a nonexistent 
Supreme Being and a bitter tract of faithlessness in a hostile universe. 
</P>
<P>
Now, somewhat less abrasively and more commercially, comes the first American 
solo hit from Midge Ure: a more upbeat anthem also titled "Dear God" -- 
strictly coincidence, according to Ure. 
</P>
<P>
"The XTC thing?" said the unfailingly polite Scotsman, on a recent visit to 
town. "I wasn't aware of it at all until last week. The record company played 
me a cassette of it. It's a very good song. It's a bit more cynical than mine, 
but a similar sort of sentiment, except mine was more questioning and theirs 
was a bit more sort of a statement." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, whereas XTC's attitude was defiantly atheistic, Ure comes off as 
hopefully agnostic, petitioning the God Who May Be There for "a worldwide 
religion . . . hope for the children . . . peace in a restless world." 
</P>
<P>
It's not a surprising posture, given that Ure was the co-writer with Bob Geldof 
of the original charity sing-along, Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas?," 
and a prime mover behind the Live Aid and FreedomFest benefit concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he thinks this request for a "worldwide religion" is in any danger of 
being delivered soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tall order," he admitted. "I've a real problem with religion. I find it 
very, very bizarre that someone's god is better than anybody else's god so they 
end up killing each other over it. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I come from, there's a real inbred bigotry. Glasgow's very similar to 
Belfast. You don't choose your religion, you're born into it. And I thought 
that everyone in Britain felt the same way -- like a Catholic girl couldn't 
marry into a Protestant boy's family, and a Catholic football team couldn't 
have a Protestant player. It wasn't until I moved away that I realized that not 
everybody felt that way." 
</P>
<P>
More such weighty world topics are to be found on Ure's second solo album, 
"Answers to Nothing." The reasons for his heightened consciousness? "I don't 
think that the whole Band Aid/Live Aid saga started me off on all the things 
that I've written about on the album. But having a baby certainly did. I never 
particularly worried about (world problems) for myself or for other people, but 
there's a whole new responsibility that I never dreamed of before, and you do 
start to worry." CHRIS WILLMAN

POPLINE: A REAL TEEN SENSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
R&amp;B singer Tracie Spencer, the 13-year-old phenom, pondered a very silly 
question: What would happen if heartthrob Al B. Sure! walked through the door 
of the Hollywood record-company office? 
</P>
<P>
She looked at the door and started giggling, burying her face in her hands. 
"I'd probably die," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first indication that there was a real teen-ager under that aloof, 
low-key facade. 
</P>
<P>
"In these situations, I can't act like a typical teen-ager, like I am with my 
friends," explained Spencer, who signed with Capitol Records in the summer of 
'87, about six months after a spectacular triumph -- at age 11 -- on the TV 
talent-hunt show "Star Search." "I have to be professional -- mature and all 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Though never bubbly and outgoing during the interview, she did loosen up a bit 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
Because her vocals sound so mature and because she's tall for her age and much 
older-looking than 13, it's easy to forget her real age. "People may forget 
that I'm so young but I don't," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by her father, a former singer, Spencer starting singing as a toddler 
back in her hometown of Waterloo, Iowa. She had other aspirations too. "When I 
was 5, I wanted to be a nurse and a professional basketball player," she 
recalled. "You know how kids are." 
</P>
<P>
While developing her singing skills doing amateur engagements in preparation 
for a professional career, Spencer had only one fear: "I thought if I became a 
celebrity, my friends might treat me differently and not like me anymore. So 
far that hasn't happened." 
</P>
<P>
How does she deal with the rigors and demands of the pop-music business? 
</P>
<P>
"My father watches out for me," she replied. "But I watch out for myself too. I 
get frustrated sometimes when I'm around a lot of older people all the time and 
I'm working real hard. Sometimes I want to run off and be lazy but I can't. I 
have to remember I'm not a kid anymore." DENNIS HUNT

EBB TIDE: Is Power 106 morning deejay Jay Thomas over the hill? Or maybe 
running scared? We're starting to wonder -- especially after he made such a big 
deal about soliciting names for his morning show -- and then picked "The Power 
106 Morning Zoo," an embarrassingly lame name already in use at dozens of 
stations around the country. Is it possible Thomas chose "Morning Zoo" because 
it was the same moniker his new rival -- arriving KIQQ-FM deejay Scott Shannon 
-- used for his morning program at New York's top-rated Z100 station?

NOTEBOOK: HUNGRY, PERPLEXED DINERS HAVE A WAIT PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reader in Rancho Palos Verdes, who asks that her name not be used, raises 
once again the question of what to do when reservations aren't honored on time. 
She had booked a table for five at Fennel in Santa Monica for 9:15 on a Friday 
night -- a later reservation than she would have liked, but one that she 
accepted because she was entertaining out-of-town guests who were anxious to 
try the place. Unfortunately, she continues, the party occupying what was to be 
her table had arrived late for their own reservations and lingered over coffee 
-- and she and her friends were not seated until 10:10. 
</P>
<P>
"As hosts of our group, what should we have done?" she asks, adding that if it 
had been just her and her husband, they would have gone next door to eat. 
(There are four restaurants immediately adjacent to Fennel -- Ivy at the Shore, 
Opera, the Red Sea, and Visconti.) Further, she inquires, "What should the 
restaurant have done? There appeared (to be) no other tables for groups our 
size in the restaurant and there were no unoccupied tables near each other. 
Should the restaurant have collected tables and pushed them together? Should 
they have insisted that (the lingering party) hurry?" 
</P>
<P>
These questions are not easily answered. In earlier columns on this subject, 
I've advocated that customers made to wait too long for their tables should 
simply leave, taking their business elsewhere. I probably would have left 
Fennel myself after 15 or 20 minutes in this case. On the other hand, a good 
host tries to please his or her guests. If the guests in this case were 
hell-bent on Fennel, then perhaps the host could have obtained a realistic 
estimate of when her table would be ready, and then repaired to, say, Opera -- 
which has a long, comfortable, superbly stocked bar, instead of the small, 
rather perfunctory stand-up one at Fennel -- to wait. 
</P>
<P>
As to what the restaurant should have done, the best answer is that -- in the 
best of all possible worlds -- it wouldn't have booked the place so tightly to 
begin with. It might have deliberately kept a few tables open, even, to 
accommodate scheduling problems caused by the inevitable lingerers and late 
arrivals. Since this is a notion that most contemporary American restaurants 
apparently find unthinkable, Fennel should have tried to put some tables 
together (if it were physically possible) -- or at least bought a bottle of 
champagne for the waiting party, to help ease the real pain of delay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHECKERED OUT: The kitchen at Checkers, the new luxury hotel scheduled to open 
soon in downtown Los Angeles, under the same ownership as the superb Campton 
Place in San Francisco, apparently has a revolving door. Only a month ago Elka 
Gilmore, former chef at Camelions in Santa Monica and chef/co-owner of the 
now-defunct Tumbleweed in Beverly Hills, was named executive chef of the 
hostelry. She no longer holds that post. "We just turned out to have a conflict 
of styles," says Bill Wilkinson, president of Ayala Hotels, which owns the 
property. "I'm more conservative than she is. She has established a reputation 
for herself, and I think she wants to pursue her own projects. She and I just 
had different expectations." Gilmore could not be reached for comment. He is 
currently interviewing for a replacement, Wilkinson adds -- but, in the 
meantime, Bradley Ogden, longtime chef at Campton Place, "will get us open." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COOKING POT-POURRI: Pascal Vignau, formerly with the Four Seasons Ritz-Carlton 
in Chicago, and Jean-Pierre Lemanissier, who was the last chef at the original 
Ma Maison, have been named as executive chef and restaurant chef, respectively, 
at the Four Seasons Hotel "at Beverly Hills" (as they say -- meaning just 
across the street from Beverly Hills on Doheny). . . . Claudio Marchesan, who 
was executive chef for both the Spectrum Foods and Il Fornaio restaurant 
groups, has opened his own trattoria, Pane e Vino, in Santa Barbara. . . . And 
the wines of Santa Barbara County will be featured exclusively, for a limited 
time, at the Fish Company (formerly the Famous Enterprise Fish Company) in 
Santa Monica. Among wineries represented are Au Bon Climat, Sanford, Qupe (not 
"Quip,' " as the restaurant's publicity has it), Byron, and J. Carey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ON THE FRONT BURNER: All couples dining at Cafe Cafe in Westwood on Valentine's 
Day will be given a free glass of wine and a chance to enter the restaurant's 
"Most Romantic Couple" contest. Entrants will be asked to describe "how they 
met or another romantic aspect of their relationship." The winning twosome 
receives a gift certificate good for dinner for two on a return visit. And on 
the Feb. 21, the same restaurant offers a $9.95-per-person pizza and wine 
tasting, featuring samples of eight "international" pizzas (Greek, with feta 
cheese and olives; Thai, with chicken in spicy peanut sauce; and so on) and 
eight California and Italian wines. . . . El Vez, the Mexican Elvis, performs 
his burning-love gyrations between rounds of miniature martinis and a 
passionate array of appetizers and entrees at City Restaurant, Tuesday, when 
the restaurant hosts the Valentine's Day Celebratory Benefit for LACE (Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions). Price is $75 per person. Call (213) 938-2155 
for information. . . . The American Institute of Wine and Food presents 
"Celebrations," a showing of special occasion and holiday dining tabletop 
designs and menus, by an assortment of top L.A. designers and chefs, on 
Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 19. The exhibition is open to the public, and tickets 
are $10 at the door. A benefit preview on Friday, precedes the two-day 
exhibition. Tickets for this event are $75 apiece for the reception, and either 
$135 or $150 (depending on the restaurant) for the reception and dinner at one 
of the 14 top local eateries participating. The special occasions and holidays 
involved, incidentally, include not only St. Patrick's Day, New Year's Eve and 
such, but also the Feast of Ramadan, a Home Casino Party, and a Cast Party for 
Oprah Winfrey. Call (213) 473-5324 for more information.

Even though rapper and ex-gang member Tone Loc lectures at schools, I find it 
hard to believe anyone would consider him a role model to ghetto youngsters 
("Tone Loc: A 'Wild Thing' in the World of Rap," Jan. 29). 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Hunt quotes him as saying, "For the right money, I'd play a Ku Klux Klan 
rally." Tone exhibits a common social disorder known as greed. I doubt he has 
ever been serious about anything, including gang membership.

MIXING IT UP WITH PETER SELLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Peter Sellars' commentary in "The Big Mix" Feb. 5, I nearly fell 
into a suicidal despondency because I'm culturally anemic, American and white. 
</P>
<P>
But before I reached for a razor blade, I began reviewing my recent cultural 
experiences to see how many could be categorized as ethnically themed. I tried 
to visualize how many involved a different skin color, hoping desperately that 
Thai food would count. 
</P>
<P>
Is this what Sellars wants? With his separatist attitude, he is defeating his 
own purpose, building partitions instead of breaking them. To pinpoint any art 
as black, Asian, Hispanic, etc., is a disservice to the artists, who probably 
like me would have never given it a thought and have taken for granted that it 
was simply American art.

In between the commercials, jokes, concert announcements, traffic reports,

NANCY VALE'S NAME may be unfamiliar to Americans, but her sweaters are sold all 
over the country under Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and other labels. The 
sweaters are gorgeous, from a thick Navajo-style cardigan to an Early American 
sampler design on a pullover. Vale, an "English mum" who has become a design 
tycoon in Britain, offers patterns that are full of complicated cables and 
color changes, and most of them are knitted on small needles -- a lifetime 
project for some of us. Still, anyone with modest talent and extravagant 
patience could really make something out of this book. ($24.95) Judith Sims

PUBLISHED FIRST IN Germany, "Old Garden Roses" is a collection of 83 
photographic portraits of classic roses from the days before hybridizing -- 
moss, gallica, alba, shrub roses, floribunda, centifolia, damask, bourbon, 
climbing, sweet briar. And old they are: The earliest rose dates back to before 
1300, though the majority are 19th-Century beauties. The introduction includes 
a survey of the rose in history, legend and the arts. At the end of the book, 
the origin and history of each rose pictured is detailed. But the main 
attractions are the photographs themselves. Intimate and larger than life, they 
are so engaging as to bring a heightened appreciation for all roses. ($50)

COOTS -- FEATHERED VARIETY -- DRAW CURSES, GUNFIRE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
William M. Schwartz has a million-dollar view from his Lake Mission Viejo Assn. 
office window. 
</P>
<P>
But the other day, Schwartz, who is the general manager of the association, 
looked out the window with a pained, agonized expression. He was looking at 
coots, the scores of small black waterfowl paddling around Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the coots defecate all over everything. . . . Coots hurt the lake. 
They hurt the landscaping because they eat the grass and the seeds. They're a 
real problem." 
</P>
<P>
Problem or no, they won't go away, for it's coot season in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
From the cold climes of Canada, the dark-colored water birds have been flying 
in to spend the winter in sunny Southern California. Palm Springs is usually 
too hot and dry, but Orange County is just right. They especially like the 
man-made lakes that decorate expensive subdivisions and country clubs in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The love affair, however, is not mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"Many associations like ours have to spend a lot of money to try to repair all 
the damage they cause," Schwartz said. "Our lake is one that people swim in, so 
we're real, real concerned about water quality. 
</P>
<P>
"What the coots do basically is add nutrients to the lake. The nutrients 
deplete the oxygen in the lake, and this hurts the ecosystem of the aquatic 
chain in the lake. Everything suffers." 
</P>
<P>
To try to bring nature back in balance, the Lake Mission Viejo Assn. has a 
federal permit to shoot the water fowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It varies as to how often we go out (on shooting expeditions)," said Schwartz. 
"From once a month to every three weeks. We use shotguns." 
</P>
<P>
Up to 100 birds can be dispatched in one expedition, but more return to fill 
the depleted ranks. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of Mission Viejo residents to the bird killing is "both pro and 
con," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people around the lake really understand the problem and know why this has 
to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes other residents question doing in the coots. Rather than looking 
fierce or threatening, coots can look downright lovable. With white beaks, red 
eyes and black feathers, they have a humorous appearance. A coot-covered lake 
looks something like a Daffy Duck convention. 
</P>
<P>
o Coots are not ducks, however. According to the World Book Encyclopedia, coots 
are also called mud hens and are members of the rail family. "The saying 'silly 
as a coot' probably comes from the bird's clumsiness," the encyclopedia says. 
</P>
<P>
But the coot's clumsiness ends when it gets into the water. There it looks like 
an Olympic champ as it darts underwater or body-surfs on lake waves. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the birds become agitated and sound off, emitting a honking, 
screeching noise that resembles that of an adolescent boy whose voice is 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
The messy habits of the birds, however, are chiefly what makes them social 
pariahs in many Orange County subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
At the Lake Forest Community Assn. in south Orange County, coots are blamed for 
the guano-splattered boardwalk by the lake. "See all this mess?" grimaced Jeff 
Horn, community relations director for the association. "This is what coots do. 
They also pollute the lake." 
</P>
<P>
The Lake Forest association, however, has not declared war on the coots. 
Residents have just tried to live with the uninvited visitors, Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Audubon Society, coots migrate to Southern California 
from the plains states and parts of Canada. Officials at the society said the 
birds arrive in Orange County in October and remain until March or April. 
</P>
<P>
"Coots can be found any place where turf and water are together," said Pete 
Butchko, a supervisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Damage Control 
in Visalia. 
</P>
<P>
Grass and plant life are staples in the birds' diet, so coots often congregate 
on golf courses, wildlife officials said. They dig their beaks into the greens, 
leaving large holes. Their droppings also kill some plants. 
</P>
<P>
"They are messy when they decide to relieve themselves," said Louis Izurieta, 
manager of the Santa Ana Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Country Club -- like many other golf clubs in Southern California 
-- has obtained a permit allowing the club to shoot the coots. Butchko said he 
approved about 50 permits to kill coots in Southern California last year, most 
going to golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife officials said that killing coots does not hurt their population, 
because they "multiply like rabbits," but some still question the wisdom of 
shooting them to alleviate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't like people out there killing animals because they want to get 
rid of them or because they're a nuisance," said John Borneman, a spokesman for 
the National Audubon Society in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that this takes place every year. People haven't learned how to 
live with the cycles of wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
But those trying to cope with the coot at Orange County lakes say the little 
bird is a big pain. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish all these coots would be gone," said Horn, as he stood on the 
dung-splattered boardwalk at Lake Forest. "They cause a problem for everybody's 
docks. They just make a mess of things."

MOST UNLISTED PHONES; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERNERS FINALLY GET LINE ON L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY MATHEWS, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Americans have ridiculed Southern California's fabled rootlessness, 
that sense of disconnected ennui, New Age cocooning and traffic-jam isolation 
chronicled by unfriendly East Coast writers. 
</P>
<P>
Californians themselves often have been impatient with such analysis and quick 
to discount it as envy and sour grapes from people bitter about lack of 
sunshine and orange blossoms in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, marketing researchers from the frosty environs of Fairfield, 
Conn., have produced a troubling survey that seems to back up with real numbers 
some longstanding impressions about the self-absorbed West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Survey Sampling Inc. reports that residents of Los Angeles have become so 
disdainful of uninvited contact with the outside world that more than half have 
unlisted telephone numbers, far more than in any major city in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Connecticut company, which sells telephone numbers to market research 
firms, said the 56% figure for unlisted numbers in Los Angeles is exceeded only 
in Las Vegas, whose residents' rootlessness and nighttime schedules have 
produced an unlisted phone rate of 60.3%. 
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 8 of the top 10 U.S. metropolitan areas for unlisted 
numbers are in California. 
</P>
<P>
John Lamb, the firm's client-service specialist, said he is not certain what 
produced this phenomenon but gives some credence to the notion that "a lot of 
people who live in California screwed up something in the East and are trying 
to get as far away from that and from other people as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor may be a high percentage of young adults in the West. The survey 
shows that, throughout the country, two-thirds of those with unlisted numbers 
are under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike older Americans, many of whom apparently consider unlisted numbers 
faintly unneighborly, the younger generation appears to see great advantage in 
keeping its phone numbers secret from salesmen, fund-raisers and rejected 
suitors, even if it costs an extra 30 cents a month. 
</P>
<P>
The average percentage of unlisted numbers for all metropolitan areas in the 
country climbed from 21.8% in 1984 to 27.6% last year, and Lamb said the steady 
growth will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Baldwin, spokeswoman for Pacific Bell, said her records show a 
somewhat smaller percentage of unlisted numbers. About 45% of the company's 1.9 
million customers in Los Angeles County are unlisted, as are about 40% of all 
Bell customers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once a Sign of Fame 
</P>
<P>
This goes much higher in areas such as Beverly Hills, "where you don't see a 
very large phone book," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlisted numbers once were considered signs of fame and fortune, of people too 
important to be bothered. But the survey indicates a similar reluctance on the 
lower end of the income scale to list telephone numbers, particularly as 
computerized campaigns to sell everything from toothpaste to travel packages 
flood telephone lines around dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
Many people take their numbers out of the book in the hope of preventing such 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
This often does not work, because many firms use random-dialing systems that 
catch unlisted numbers anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting customer distress plants potentially profitable seeds of interest 
in a new device that will let the discriminating resident screen all calls 
while the phone is ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "Caller ID" or "Custom Local Area Signaling Service (CLASS)," the 
system uses a small, $80 box that attaches to the telephone and provides a 
digital display of the number from which the call is placed. If the number is 
unfamiliar or that of an annoying friend or angry boss, the call can be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said the system is to be introduced in California over the next year 
and will include such refinements as a special ring for calls from special 
friends whose numbers have been programmed into the device. 
</P>
<P>
In New Jersey, where the system is available, initial response was "three times 
what we expected," said New Jersey Bell spokesman James W. Carrigan. 
</P>
<P>
Washington ranks only eighth among major metropolitan areas and 47th overall in 
unlisted numbers, but its 26.2% -- very close to C&amp;P Telephone Co. 
estimates -- is enough to suggest a healthy market for Caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone surprises, unpleasant or otherwise, then would diminish. Life would 
proceed more quietly in self-sufficient cocoons of automatic telephone 
monitoring, videocassette recorders and shopping by cable, letting 
introspection continue without further interruption.

CONFISCATED WEAPONS WIND UP AS SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How to dispose of tons of weapons confiscated from criminals has stymied law 
enforcement for years. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department dumped the estimated 5 to 
7 tons of weapons confiscated each year into the Catalina Channel. When that 
was deemed ecologically troubling, the weapons were crushed at a Carson hammer 
mill, then melted. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Leonard Potashman, first an artist and art professor for more than 10 
years and then a detective for the Sheriff's Department for 29 years, came up 
with what he thought was a better solution. 
</P>
<P>
Potashman, who at the time was one of the United States' top two art theft 
detectives, persuaded former Sheriff Peter Pitchess to allow him to create a 
15-foot-high, 10-ton sculpture out of molten steel and the mounds of pistols, 
rifles and machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "Monument of Futility" by Pitchess, the sculpture, which took Potashman 
and a crew of workers from 1975 to 1977 to create, was "misunderstood" by Los 
Angeles officials and so infuriated the National Rifle Assn. that the powerful 
group lobbied against it being placed downtown, Potashman said in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The NRA was just a little on the paranoid side," Potashman said. "They felt it 
was in open support of gun control, so a plan to place it near the Civic Center 
fell through." 
</P>
<P>
After disappearing for five years due to the demolition of the steel company 
where it was created, the sculpture turned up in the Montebello Police 
Department's confiscated vehicles warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"A member of the work crew demolishing the company and carting off the waste 
was a reserve member of the Montebello Police Department, and obviously a 
forward-thinking fellow," Potashman said. "He persuaded the captain at least to 
let it stay in the warehouse until they could figure out what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Montebello city officials were not aware of who had created the sculpture, but 
it and Potashman were reunited after an article about the art theft detective 
was published in The Times mentioning the project. 
</P>
<P>
The soaring, elegant monument -- with its severe angles featuring panels of 
smashed rifle barrels that take on a serpentine quality and ghost images of 
pistols -- is now on permanent display at the Montebello Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
It is the most public work by Potashman, 62, who was trained as an artist at 
the Chicago Art Institute, the American Academy of Art, the Academy of Fine 
Arts in Los Angeles and the University of Guadalajara in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an artist and an art professor, but I had a family to support, so I took 
a 29-year temporary job with the sheriff's department," Potashman said. 
</P>
<P>
From 1953 to 1982, Potashman performed a variety of duties for the department, 
including establishing the first law enforcement art crime detail on the West 
Coast and creating the first dimensional sculpture of a murder victim. 
</P>
<P>
During his law enforcement career, he continued to work as an artist, 
exhibiting at galleries across the country and having his works included in 
several group shows. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of his works was opened in December at the Orlando Gallery in 
Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The works on display combine painting and sculpture, utilizing parts of the 
human anatomy attached to canvases with lines of paint running directly from 
the human heads and arms onto the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way is Leonard's work macabre or strange; it is extremely personal," 
said gallery director Robert Giro. "Combining the two media, sculpture and 
painting, he bridges illusion and reality." 
</P>
<P>
Although retired from police work, Potashman works full-time as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sheriff's Department truly indulged me. They thought I was an oddball, but 
we found practical work that benefited everyone," he said. "Now my work is more 
philosophical, and hopefully for the viewer, provoking."

FISH AND WHALES REAP THE BENEFITS OF HUMAN MEDICAL CARE FOR EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MILLER, Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just like humans, whales and fish can have eye problems related to stress, 
trauma and infection. 
</P>
<P>
Whales, small man-eating piranhas, tropical angelfish and "look-downs" -- flat 
fish about the size of a small plate -- can develop "cloudy eye" or 
exopthalmus, more commonly known as "pop eye." 
</P>
<P>
Water animals also can suffer from corneal ulcers, mostly from trauma, and get 
flukes, a saltwater worm that hooks into the eye and causes abrasion and 
possible infection. 
</P>
<P>
When fish get sick with pop eye, both eyes protrude three-quarters of the way 
out of their sockets and, until recently, when that occurred the fish were 
doomed, according to Dr. Joanne Waeltermann, a pediatric ophthalmologist.

Waeltermann and Dr. Michael Stoskopf, chief of medicine at the National 
Aquarium in Baltimore, have found that by using time-release injections of 
steroids and antibiotics, they can prevent 75% of pop eye victims from dying. 
</P>
<P>
With a tiny needle, the drops are injected every three days into the 
surrounding tissue of the eye, after the fish is anesthetized. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been pretty successful in keeping the fish around, but we can't get 
their eyes to go all the way back," says Waeltermann. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with the use of a special kind of glue, the physicians are also saving 
the eyes and lives of fish whose corneal ulcers are so deep they go all the way 
through the cornea. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, the ophthalmologist, who treats the eyes of whales and fish 
every Wednesday at the aquarium, discovered that Anore -- one of three beluga 
or "white whales" -- was swimming with her eyes shut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stress Causes Problems 
</P>
<P>
Whenever any of the whales or fish are stressed, their eyes either bulge or 
their corneas -- the clear part of the eye over the pupil and iris -- become 
clouded. 
</P>
<P>
"Anore was having a lot of trouble with her eyes because she was under stress 
-- Illamar, the other 6-year-old beluga whale, was picking on her," Waeltermann 
says. "Animals will establish a pecking order. Illamar was more dominant and 
that was causing Anore's stress." 
</P>
<P>
When the two physicians finally got Anore up to a raft and with patience got 
her to open her eyes, they saw that her corneas were very cloudy and that she 
had a herpes infection deep in the cornea. They then applied a special eye 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the corneas are still slightly scarred, but she's much more comfortable 
and no longer swims around with her eyes shut," Waeltermann said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Herpes Spreads 
</P>
<P>
Herpes is a virus caused by stress, too, and since Anore had a herpes infection 
on her skin to begin with, it was easy for it to spread to her eyes, according 
to the ophthalmologist. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, a piranha -- a small South American fish that often attacks 
men and large animals -- was afflicted with an exophthalmic eye, which caused 
the eyes to bulge. 
</P>
<P>
No longer attractive, the piranha had been removed from the exhibit area and 
had undergone treatment that is lifesaving in 75% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
"By giving the fish an injection of an antibiotic and a steroid, we can get the 
eye to go back considerably," she says. "A lot of pop eye is caused by a 
bacterial infection and hormonal imbalance. The fish with this ailment and 
suffering from stress could be the low fish on the totem pole, too." 
</P>
<P>
Waeltermann and Stoskopf plan to do a small scientific exhibit on their success 
in treating pop eye for the next meeting of the American Academy of 
Ophthalmology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corneal Ulcers 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cloudy eye and pop eye, water animals also can develop corneal 
ulcers, most of the time from trauma, or they can get flukes, according to 
Waeltermann. A corneal ulcer is more than an abrasion, she explains. It goes 
deeper into the stroma, the substance of the cornea. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes what will happen is that because the fish live in this aquatic 
environment, little flukes -- which are like little worms -- will hook onto the 
eyes of the fish and that can create an abrasion and an infection," the 
ophthalmologist says. 
</P>
<P>
"So, first we try to get rid of the flukes by giving fresh-water dips. The 
flukes are in the fish pool with the saltwater. What we do is take the fish 
with flukes on it and dump it in fresh water. It doesn't hurt the fish, but the 
flukes can't hold on and they drop off. Then, we give the fish antibiotic 
injections." 
</P>
<P>
The physicians are also saving the lives of fish that have corneal ulcers deep 
enough that they go all the way through the cornea. Waeltermann and Stoskopf 
use an extremely strong glue -- that is, a veterinary medical grade of 
Superglue -- to create a patch. 
</P>
<P>
"In a human, if we had a corneal abrasion, we would just patch the eye shut. 
But, you can't put a patch on a fish," Waeltermann says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sticks for Few Days 
</P>
<P>
"So, we dry the cornea, put the glue on, let it dry -- it takes about five 
seconds -- and then let the fish go back in the water. This glue patch on the 
cornea sticks for a few days. And if we can protect the cornea by keeping the 
glue on, it will heal." 
</P>
<P>
For two years -- on her day off from taking care of children with problem eyes 
-- Waeltermann has been working with Stoskopf at the aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I came along, he did the best he could," says Waeltermann. "Actually, 
he learns from me and I learn a lot from him. I basically give him what my 
experience is with humans and then we apply it to the fish."

THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gordon and Sylvia Ting's condominium is suffering from an unbearable population 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is expecting a family expansion in February with the birth of their 
first child, but they already provide a home to a burgeoning crew, including 
Don Diego de Los Osos, Robearta, Paddington . . . and about 60 other cute, 
plush, cuddly, stuffed bears of all shapes, sizes and colors. 
</P>
<P>
The Tings, you see, are wild about teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
Their stuffed bear collection takes up an entire wall of shelves in their 
living room, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Varieties 
</P>
<P>
There are at least four different Paddington bears. There is a bear from 
Australia sporting a "G'day" T-shirt. There is a serious-looking bear who is 
dressed like a guard at Buckingham Palace. There is a giant bear, about the 
size of a 5-year-old child, sporting a crown. 
</P>
<P>
There are brown bears, black bears, panda bears and koala bears -- although the 
Tings point out that among serious bear collectors, there is some dispute as to 
whether koalas can be considered true teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
"They are actually marsupials," explained Gordon Ting, a Thousand Oaks dentist. 
</P>
<P>
Ting is so into bears that he is likely to greet visitors to his home wearing 
giant bear-feet slippers. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's Christmastime Nativity scene is populated by bears -- from a 
winged bear angel to a tiny cub bear swaddled in the manger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Them on Outings 
</P>
<P>
The couple even take their bears along with them on outings and vacations: One 
of their Paddington bears accompanied them to Australia. They presented the 
customs officer with a passport for the bear, complete with his picture inside. 
And the officer obliged with a stamp in the passport. 
</P>
<P>
But the Tings are not selfish about their 12-year-old hobby. They want others 
to enjoy the warm, comforting benefits of teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Ting has organized a local chapter of Good Bears of the World 
International, a Hawaii-based organization that specializes in donating teddy 
bears to hospitals, institutions and fire and police departments. 
</P>
<P>
The small local group -- or den, as the chapters are referred to -- is called 
Bear-Cal, which serves Ventura, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles counties. Ting is 
the group's Chair Bear. 
</P>
<P>
Bear-Cal's current project is donating bears to the Tri-Counties chapter of 
Make-a-Wish, a group that grants the wishes of seriously ill children. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Jensen, president of the local Make-a-Wish chapter, said that she first 
learned of Bear-Cal after giving a talk at a Kiwanis meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"After I talked about Make-a-Wish, Dr. Ting came up to me and said that his 
bear den was looking for an organization just like this," Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Bear-Cal donated 26 bears to the group. Jensen took them with her to a national 
Make-a-Wish convention, where she distributed them to various chapters around 
the country. Since then, Bear-Cal has donated half a dozen more bears to the 
local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"They are adorable little teddy bears," Jensen said of the 10-inch bears. "We 
use them as an icebreaker when we go to a family for the first time. When we 
give a teddy bear to the child, they warm right up. You can't be unhappy when 
cuddling a soft teddy bear." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy is apparently shared by other service organizations around the 
country. Police in a small Florida community go on patrol with bears in their 
cars in case they need to comfort a traumatized child. Firefighters use them to 
coax frightened children out of dangerous situations. Some nursing homes use 
them to cheer up depressed elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospital Uses Bears 
</P>
<P>
Ting told of a Honolulu hospital that has developed a special teddy bear for 
use by patients who have undergone open heart surgery. Those patients need to 
cough following surgery to expel fluid that has gathered in their lungs. With 
the healing incision, that can be a painful proposition, Ting said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's Sirkoffalot, a teddy bear with a hard back, is useful for the 
patients to brace against their chests to lessen pain while they cough. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's a psychological benefit for the patients to hold a bear," Ting said. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Ting can testify to the comforting qualities of bears. She said she took 
one into the orthodontist's office when she had her braces removed, and that 
she packs a bear in her suitcase on her frequent business trips. 
</P>
<P>
"They help me sleep," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Tings said that while they are serious about their bears, they are not 
serious bear collectors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collect Valuable Bears 
</P>
<P>
That group includes people who collect only valuable bears, such as German 
Stieff bears, considered the Rolls-Royce of the teddy bear world, or antique 
teddys, which date back to the Theodore Roosevelt presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The term was coined after a series of Clifford Berryman cartoons, which 
depicted the bully President with a bear cub. A Brooklyn couple made and 
marketed a stuffed version of the bear, launching the Ideal Toy Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Tings prefer to collect their bears for sentimental reasons and for fun. 
The reason is simple: "Just because we like to hold them," Sylvia Ting said.

O'SULLIVAN HOPES TO ADD TO REPUTATION IN TIMES MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Eamonn Coghlan, world record-holder in the mile, decided to retire, fellow 
Irishman Marcus O'Sullivan quickly took over as "Chairman of the Boards." 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old O'Sullivan has been virtually unbeatable the past two years and 
in 1988 ran the fastest 1500 meters ever indoors, 3:35.4 at East Rutherford. He 
also ran the third-fastest mile in history, 3:50.94, a figure basted only by 
Coghlan. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at the Forum in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games, O'Sullivan will be 
running the mile against two other Irishmen, Frank O'Mara and Ray Flynn, Jose 
Abascal of Spain, Nourdine Morcelli, Algeria (Riverside City College), and the 
lone American, Jeff Atkinson, winner of last year's Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan -- as expected -- won the mile here last year and then went on to 
wrap up another superb season by winning the USA/Mobil Indoor Mile title in 
3:59.85. 
</P>
<P>
At Seoul in 1988, he finished eighth in the 1500 meters in 3:38.39. That race 
was missing Morocco's Said Aouita, the world record-holder at that distance, 
who had a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
After winning his first two races ever run indoors on the boards last weekend 
on the East coast, Aouita indicated he might like to try the mile at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"When O'Sullivan runs by himself, that's one story," Aouita said. "When he runs 
with Aouita, that's another story." 
</P>
<P>
Can O'Sullivan beat Aouita should the Moroccoan(sp?) opt for the mile rather 
than the scheduled 3000 meters? 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous to predict what a race is going to be like because what happens 
is you're not ready for the unexpected," O'Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
"You ride it along and wait for the cards to unfold and everyone, sooner or 
later, will show their cards. It could be some guy in the field saying, 'The 
hell with you. I'm going from the beginning. You either come with me or you 
don't come.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a game of poker." 
</P>
<P>
A possible O'Sullivan-Aouita confrontation will depend on Aouita, says meet 
director Will Kern. "He can run any distance he wants." 
</P>
<P>
If Auoita decides on the 3000 meters he will face Steve Scott, who set the 
Times record at the distance last year at 7:57.78; a pair of U.S. Olympians 
Doug Padilla and Brian Abshire, Mark Junkerman and countryman Aziz Sahar.

SUDDENLY, AN AUDIENCE FOR ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tad Szulc, Veteran foreign correspondent Tad Szulc traveled with Yasser 
Arafat at the end of January. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TUNIS, TUNISIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A one-time world pariah has become a would-be peacemaker. Yasser Arafat now 
works at "a great historical opportunity" -- the first such opportunity in 40 
years, he says -- to settle the future fate of Palestinians through 
negotiations. The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, during 
three days of in-depth conversations in Tunis and Algiers at the end of 
January, talked about the United States being in a position to play a "decisive 
role" in this process. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat claimed that new diplomatic momentum has developed since November in 
Palestinian peace efforts -- involving the United States, Sweden, the European 
Community and Arab countries. That momentum must not be lost, he emphasized, 
because the alternative would be tragedy for Jews and Arabs alike. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat is playing what he calls "the American card." He began by accepting 
Washington's demand that the PLO recognize Israel's right to a secure existence 
and renounce terrorism before any U.S.-PLO discussions; he did it at a news 
conference following his speech before the U.N. General Assembly in Geneva on 
Dec. 14. Arafat's basic objective, in return, is establishment of an 
independent Palestinian state on Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 
1967 War. In his approach to the United States, he claims having volunteered to 
help investigate the terrorist bomb aboard Pan Am 103 and having interceded to 
free the U.S. hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
A small, bouncy 59-year-old, Arafat usually appeared relaxed during formal 
tape-recorded interviews and less formal meals, but a sense of eye-darting 
impatience also came through. In our first discussion at a seaside mansion near 
Carthago -- once the home of the French resident general, now the residence of 
the PLO ambassador to Tunisia -- Arafat explained at length how tough it had 
been for him to prevail on his PLO "brothers" that it was vital to "play the 
American card" even while Palestinians were fighting in Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada -- the uprising in Israeli-occupied territories -- could not and 
would not be halted, he said. He even speculated that he might lift his order 
that prohibits Palestinians from returning fire with fire in battles with the 
Israeli army. But to achieve more than increasingly deadly confrontations, the 
PLO cause had to break out of diplomatic isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Momentum toward negotiation began building almost eight months ago, after 
imaginative and secret mediation from faraway Sweden by Foreign Minister Sten 
Sture Andersson and his top aides. The Swedes were the ones who convinced 
Arafat that the only plausible road to peaceful settlement with Israel was via 
the United States. The intifada was already costing hundreds of Arab lives, 
most of them young people. 
</P>
<P>
As violence grew, the Reagan Administration also began looking for new routes 
toward Middle East peace. After the November U.S. elections, and with the 
approval of George Bush, Washington told Sweden that it would accept a PLO 
dialogue once Arafat met U.S. conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat believes that three key events occurred to create a propitious climate 
for settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The first, he said, was "the Soviet-American detente on the international 
level"; it led the superpowers "to cool down all the hot spots and soothe all 
the regional problems." It provided a background for addressing Middle East 
conflict. Washington and Moscow, Arafat suggested, may no longer use the 
Palestinian issue for their own purposes of confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
The second "is the return of Egypt to Arab unity," allowing Cairo to rejoin the 
Arab summit group and the Arab League after 10 years of absence (Egypt was 
expelled for signing the Camp David accords with Israel). Acting in concert for 
the first time, the Arabs may be a significant element in peace diplomacy. 
Although King Hussein of Jordan announced last July that the West Bank problem 
would no longer be a Jordanian responsibility, Arafat said the PLO was ready to 
establish a confederation between a new Palestinian state and Jordan if the 
monarch was willing. 
</P>
<P>
The third is "the Palestinian level -- the intifada." Arafat said the uprising 
began taking shape as early as 1986 although it did not fully emerge until 
December, 1987. It became possible, he went on, "when the barrier of fear was 
broken among our people." Now the intifada "is similar to what the Indians had 
done in facing the British occupation." He said 100% of the 1.7 million 
Palestinians in the occupied territories support the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial thing now, he argued, is to convince the United States to prevail 
on Israel to accept either direct negotiations with the PLO or to attend an 
international conference on return of the occupied lands. "France, China and 
Russia and even Britain support the conference," he said, "so why doesn't the 
U.S. agree, too?" 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-PLO conversations began on Dec. 16, two days after the Arafat press 
conference. U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia Robert H. Pelletreau Jr. met with a PLO 
team headed by Yasser Abed Rabbo, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. 
Tunis is the site of the talks -- several unannounced sessions were held during 
January -- because this city has been Arafat's PLO headquarters since his 
Beirut expulsion in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said his immediate contribution to the peace process is a "major effort" 
to obtain release of American hostages as soon as possible. He called the 
taking of hostages a violation of "humanitarian principles" and indicated that 
he had a general idea who was holding the Americans although he refused to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
During a dinner meeting, Arafat opened his files on the Pan Am 103 sabotage 
investigation. There were pages in Arabic script, including a sketch of the 
Boeing 747 after the crash, its cockpit detached from the rest of the fuselage. 
He had ordered his intelligence experts to launch their own investigation -- in 
response to a U.S. request -- and had received the first clues. The bomb, he 
said, was inside a Samsonite suitcase and had been traced back to Frankfurt. 
Arafat, an engineer by training, had no doubt that the jet was blown up by 
radicals determined to derail the Palestinian "peace process" and, 
specifically, the new PLO-U.S. dialogues. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat refused to place blame but other PLO leaders said they strongly suspect 
the Iranian-directed Hezbollah guerrilla movement in Lebanon. They talked about 
hard-line factions in Iran that oppose all dialogue with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's support within the PLO is holding, he said, partly because of the 
great international response to his negotiation offers -- the best world 
perception the Palestinians have ever enjoyed. But he knows there is still 
sullen resentment among PLO hard-liners even as they pay public lip service to 
the "new diplomacy." The survivor of 40 years of Palestinian struggles, Arafat 
has no illusions; his critics wait for him to slip -- and he is ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
He is also ready for Israeli resistance. "Now we have an international 
consensus for peace," Arafat went on. "The European Community has accepted it. 
The socialist countries have accepted it. The Arab countries have accepted it. 
The African countries have accepted it. The Islamic countries have accepted it. 
The nonaligned countries have accepted it. But while we had this historical 
initiative to achieve peace, I am sorry to say that there was a completely 
negative response from the Israelis. Not only that, they are attacking the 
dialogue, which began between the PLO and the American Administration and the 
new President, Mr. Bush. And they're trying their best to stop it through 
different channels and pressures." 
</P>
<P>
Bitterly, Arafat complained that from Israel, "the response to our initiative 
was escalation -- escalation against our people, against our masses, against 
our children, against our women. This is state terrorism." Then he looked at 
his U.S. visitor and said: "But in spite of that, we are continuing in our 
peace line because it is a strategic policy. It is not a tactical one." 
</P>
<P>
The PLO leadership is in close contact with intifada leadership, called the 
Unified National Command of the Uprising. The PLO and UNCU, Arafat said, speak 
with the same voice: "Now the Israelis know they are facing the masses, that 
our kids in refugee camps everywhere complement the struggle of our youths who 
are throwing stones in the occupied territories." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the uprising began because "our new generations began to discover 
that this Israeli enemy is not the huge invincible enemy their propaganda 
claimed," adding that Israel's failure to control Lebanon after the 1982 
invasion convinced Palestinians that they had a chance to fight back some day. 
</P>
<P>
While diplomacy develops, intifada goes on. Arafat talked about four stages, 
the last having been a "partial strike." The fifth stage would be a "complete 
strike," now in preparation. And the final stage will be "national 
disobedience," designed to paralyze the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat was not hiding his impatience about the pace of the new U.S. talks. Yes, 
he said, he was willing and ready to participate personally in conversations 
with the United States, sounding like he was looking forward to an invitation 
from American envoys. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Administration must now decide if it will support our strategic 
policy of peace," he argued, instead of siding with Israel's continued 
opposition to negotiations, either directly with the PLO or at an international 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat clearly enjoyed revealing that the PLO has been talking to the United 
States for years. There had been prior, secret high-level contacts with ranking 
emissaries of successive U.S. Administrations, although neither side had an 
interest in making them public at the time. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1974, according to Arafat, two top PLO officials met with Vernon A. 
Walters, then-deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, in Morocco. 
At that time Gerald R. Ford occupied the White House and Henry A. Kissinger was 
secretary of state. But the time was not ripe for action; Arafat decided that 
Ford and Kissinger were principally interested in trying to fathom PLO 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Then, during the Reagan Administration, Arafat said, he met repeatedly in 1981 
and 1982 with presidential emissary John Edwin Mroz, president of the New 
York-based Institute for East-West Security Studies, a respected think tank. 
Mroz now says that he indeed had hundreds of hours of discussion in Beirut: 
"Arafat understood precisely what had to be done -- he didn't need to be 
convinced." But again, the timing was wrong. No further contacts occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Although Arafat was not then ready to recognize Israel, he was willing to court 
the United States. His personal intervention with the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini helped lead to the 1979 release of women hostages held in the U.S. 
Embassy in Tehran. He also achieved, he said, return of the bodies of U.S. 
servicemen killed during the failed hostage-rescue operation in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat appears to have some optimism about his current efforts in behalf of 
U.S. hostages, as political situations evolve in Lebanon, Iran and Syria. Those 
countries' relationships -- among the most complex, delicate and explosive in 
the Middle East -- are crucial; Arafat knows the actors and implies that 
foreign hostages are pawns in regional power disputes. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his diplomacy had already won freedom for several Western European 
hostages in Lebanon; he might be able to do the same for the Americans. He went 
out of his way to emphasize recent Iranian support for the PLO peace 
initiative. He expressed hope that hard-line Syria might also become 
cooperative. Each country has powerful influence over rival Lebanese factions. 
The PLO's effective intelligence network keeps Arafat in touch; so does his own 
constant jet-hopping among Arab capitals. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat is suddenly welcome almost everywhere. The chairman is expansive, even 
buoyant, about his meteoric rise to the role of honored world celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
After an executive committee meeting in Algiers on Nov. 15, when the PLO 
declared the independence of a Palestinian state to be established in the West 
Bank and Gaza, Arafat leaped into the diplomatic arena. 
</P>
<P>
He appealed for diplomatic recognition by foreign countries, he began preparing 
contacts with Western leaders and he accepted the Swedish proposal for a 
meeting in Stockholm with a small group of prominent American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat had come to understand the importance of presenting his case to American 
public opinion in general, and American Jews in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, usually using a green executive jet belonging to the government of 
Iraq, Arafat enjoyed a 24-hour visit in Madrid where he was received by King 
Juan Carlos I. He has conferred with the foreign ministers of Spain, France and 
Greece, the three nations designated by the European Community to negotiate 
with both Israel and the PLO for a Palestinian settlement. He continues talking 
to the Swedes who are the discreet middlemen for Middle East negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Even in motion, Arafat takes good care of himself. Although he often stays up 
all night in meetings, he grabs daytime naps whenever he can -- especially on 
the private jets. He eats lightly, never touching meat at night, preferring 
fruit and a porridge-like concoction of milk, honey and wheat. He neither 
drinks alcohol nor smokes. Always courteous, he shakes hands with pilots, 
waiters and bellboys; he serves food to guests, often peeling tangerines for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's olive-green uniform is crisp and sharply pressed. He is completely 
bald and prefers not to be seen that way. He wears the Arab kaffiyeh that drops 
down on his neck and ties around the throat like a scarf, or a fur hat with the 
insignia of a phoenix, crossed swords and olive branches. A holstered revolver 
at the belt is part of the uniform; while flying, he carries a small submachine 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat invited his U.S. visitor to accompany him to Algiers, this time in a jet 
sent by the Algerian president. That night, at dinner with two aides in his 
suite at the luxurious Algerian Official Residence, the chairman again rejoiced 
in what he called the "new sympathy" for the Palestinian peace process, 
remarking that "it seems that something had touched the conscience in all the 
areas of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat could boast that after decades of silence, governments came to him, 
offering help and advice -- sending emissaries to Tunis and inviting him to 
their capitals. He does not deny his delight: "You know, one is human, we are 
all human." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat, human leader, is still military leader. "From the beginning," he said, 
"I gave strict orders not to use weapons in the intifada. In the beginning, I 
was worried and I became truly astonished." His order had been obeyed "except 
for two incidents during 14 months." 
</P>
<P>
Now he said he is only considering rescinding the order because of the 
escalation of the Israeli "Iron Fist Policy" against the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Listening for long hours to the PLO chairman, I had the impression that another 
turning point was approaching, and that Arafat felt it, too. During a lunch in 
Algiers, Arafat told Abdel Hamid Mahri, the chairman of the ruling Algerian 
political party, "It is a shame that there is no Charles de Gaulle in Israel," 
referring to De Gaulle's 1961 decision to negotiate the end of the Algerian War 
of Independence against France. 
</P>
<P>
From Tunis, Arafat deals the American card, decries Israeli intransigence and 
defends his move toward diplomacy within the PLO. "For your information," he 
said, "it took me 600 hours -- imagine 600 hours! -- to convince everybody that 
this was the way to go."

LATIN AMERICA'S DESTINY: FOREVER LINKED TO DESPOTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cecilia Rodriguez, Cecilia Rodriguez is a correspondent for El Tiempo of 
Bogota. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BOGOTA, COLOMBIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his inaugural address, George Bush spoke of a new breeze blowing freedom 
through countries around the world. If the new President believes the breeze is 
sweeping south of the border, he'd better have his windsock adjusted. Once 
again, in a cycle that seems as eternal as the weather, Latin America is under 
siege. 
</P>
<P>
The winds of change have dislodged two dictators from power: Gen. Alfredo 
Stroessner in Paraguay in a bloody coup, the same way he came to the palace 34 
years ago, and Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile's iron man who surprised the world 
by vowing to abide by the people's will as expressed in last fall's elections. 
</P>
<P>
But as in so many aspects of Latin life, things are not what they seem. The 
economic crises gripping virtually every Latin nation devour governments like a 
cancer, and none are in poorer health than the fragile and fledgling 
democracies. Coups d'etat, populists and leftist parties appear as alternatives 
to disillusioned peoples. 
</P>
<P>
The ghost of tyranny, an ancient inhabitant, hangs over the continent. As 
Stroessner and Pinochet fade from sight, the phantom smiles, for he knows there 
are others waiting in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
Although dictatorships have blossomed throughout time and continents, Latin 
America is unique. Here, despotism seems to be inseparable from destiny. 
</P>
<P>
This tendency finds its source in the Latin "race," an unlikely mixed breed. We 
are the descendants of the Spanish buscadores de oro, seekers of gold, men more 
interested in greed and adventure than in respect for law, order and good 
governance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet we are also the descendants of Indians who had the misfortune to mistake 
those gold-starved adventurers as the gods for whom they had waited for 
generations. The Indians often welcomed the conquistadores, who promptly took 
advantage of the natives' passivity to ravage their lands and civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we are descendants also of African blacks, ripped by force from their 
continent and transplanted to a New World just as their culture was maturing. 
</P>
<P>
Our legacy also includes a fading social structure that was sweeping Spain at 
the time -- one that was passed intact to its latest conquest. 
</P>
<P>
Out of such an explosive mixture surged leaders ready to accede to the 
temptation of autocracy, and a people ready to accept the extraordinary notion 
that a single individual could shape the destiny of millions through the sheer 
force of his will. 
</P>
<P>
But while they form a species without parallel in Western civilization, all 
Latin tyrants are not alike. There are, for example, the hundreds of 
second-class dictators whose names died with them, men who were links in a 
chain that formed the institution of dictatorship in any given country. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the others, the ones for whom the expression Latin dictator was 
truly created -- men like Rafael Leonidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic in 
the 1930s, the Duvaliers of Haiti and the Somozas of Nicaragua through the 
1980s. Those surrealistic personalities, with their abuses and extravagances, 
are interchangeable with the mythical protagonists of Latin novels like Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez's "Autumn of the Patriarch." 
</P>
<P>
A real dictator fulfills his imagined destiny by believing he holds absolute 
power. He is omnipotent, protected by supernatural forces. His power, he 
believes, grants him divinity. 
</P>
<P>
From any normal person, rantings of omnipotence would guarantee 
institutionalization. In these men, megalomania is a character strength. 
</P>
<P>
"God put me on the top," Pinochet once said. "There is not a single leaf in 
this country that I do not move." 
</P>
<P>
Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez, El Salvador's ruler in the 1930s, once told the 
country's archbishop, as the cleric pleaded for an end to the massacre of rebel 
peasants, that he and he alone was El Salvador's God. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, Trujillo told his readers that he had the power to stop 
hurricanes. In the high Andes of Bolivia, Mariano Melgarejo told his people 
that "God chose me to walkamong mortals, but to be more lasting than time." 
</P>
<P>
Viewing themselves as divine envoys, these dictators never make mistakes. "Me 
or chaos," Pinochet was fond of repeating. In a campaign pamphlet before last 
fall's election, he asked: "Which way are you going?" It was illustrated by two 
paths. One, to Pinochet's reelection, led through verdant countryside, past a 
lake to a sunny rainbow. The other, to his defeat, pictured a bleak desert full 
of snakes, serpents, bats and snarling skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction of their own perfection among these men authorizes them to do 
what they like, to do what is necessary to maintain power. Ecuador's Gabriel 
Garcia Moreno began his reign in the 1860s with a simple declaration: "My 
enemies must murder me. So instead, I will exterminate them all." 
</P>
<P>
From the time he seized power in 1954, Stroessner in Paraguay alternated the 
carrot and the stick -- periods of brutal repression followed by sharp economic 
upswings. From 1973 to 1986, Pinochet in Chile conducted a purge against the 
left in his country. Thousands of Chileans were exiled, tortured and executed. 
</P>
<P>
This monopoly of force, combined with crucial support from the army, fosters 
the longevity of these regimes. And for true dictators, longevity is vital. The 
Somoza dynasty in Nicaragua flourished for nearly 50 years. For 27 years, Juan 
Vincente Gomez ruled Venezuela as if it were his private plantation. In Haiti, 
the Duvaliers made international legend with their unique combination of voodoo 
and terror for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's brief 13 year-reign would seem to eliminate him from the rogues' 
gallery of dictators. But he will remain in the presidential palace until 
December, and as a former president he will be a senator for life. He will 
continue as commander-in-chief of the army until 1994 and will hold a seat on 
the powerful National Security Council -- roles that will assure him control 
over the elected civilian president for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
To these men, order is all. At one time or another, every dictator claims to 
have saved his country. Stroessner shrewdly developed his country's economic 
independence, ensuring his invulnerability to pressure from the world's great 
democracies. For his part, Pinochet helped the rich to become richer, and his 
economics allowed Chile to emerge less damaged than most from the continent's 
financial quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
The era for these two archetypes has passed. But it would be wrong to assume 
that their passing guarantees the rise of democracy in their place. Even as 
Stroessner's successor, Gen. Andres Rodriquez, was promising democracy within 
hours of assuming control, there was little talk of elections. As Stroessner's 
former No. 2, he made a fortune through government graft. The question 
inevitably arises: How long until he joins the pantheon of the gods? 
</P>
<P>
For many Latins, the idea of life without dictators is virtually unimaginable. 
A breeze indeed now blows over Latin America. But no smart weatherman would yet 
predict that it carries the seeds of true democratic change.

A GLASNOST LITMUS TEST FOR FILMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Stein, George Stein, a Times staff writer, was a fellow at Columbia 
University's W. Averell Harriman Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So much has changed in the Soviet Union since Mikhail S. Gorbachev electrified 
his country's creative and intellectual elite three years ago with his policy 
of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
At first the shift was startling: Characteristic Soviet defensiveness and 
secrecy were abandoned as article after article in newspapers and magazines 
exposed the shortcomings of Soviet society -- past and present. Formerly taboo 
authors were told their books could be taken out of drawers and the 
long-suppressed works became best sellers. Newspaper circulation soared. 
Audiences flocked to such plays as the anti-Stalinist "Speak Out" by Alexander 
Buravsky. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of this ferment, Gorbachev singled out the movie world for special 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
He attended the 1986 meeting where director Elem Klimov, an outcast under 
Leonid I. Brezhnev's stultifying regime, took leadership of the Union of Film 
Makers. And lest anyone miss the importance, Gorbachev told members of the more 
conservative writers union that they should emulate the movie people. Films "on 
the shelf" were exhumed and released. Klimov and other Soviet film artists 
traveled the world, bearing the heady message that things were changing for the 
better -- even inviting co-productions with Western film makers. The mood in 
cinema circles was ebullient. 
</P>
<P>
With all the hurrahs about the new openness, less attention was focused on the 
political rational behind encouraging the country's creative elite. The hope -- 
expressed at the Politburo level -- was that the excitement of artists and 
intellectuals would be contagious, that it would translate into the popular 
support needed to make perestroika work, that enthusiasm would break through 
the apathy and cynicism afflicting masses of rank-and-file Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
That has not happened. 
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable January speech to intellectuals, the media and party leaders, 
Gorbachev himself was forced to acknowledge that the country is increasingly 
dissatisfied with consumer and housing shortages; many are blaming his policies 
of perestroika for those shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gorbachev and others are trying to rein in glasnost in ways to make the 
program serve political aims rather than serve as a Soviet bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the contrast more evident than among the film makers. 
</P>
<P>
New economic laws have tied the hands of those who had hoped to create 
independent studios and production units modeled on the Hollywood system. Some 
film makers fear that a pending reorganization of the cinematographers' union 
may dilute its influence. 
</P>
<P>
And the overall enthusiasm for social criticism in cinema has diminished to the 
point where some Soviet movie industry insiders fear that films like "Little 
Vera," a recently released feature that unflatteringly depicts Soviet city 
life, will soon be unwelcome. In the film, the working class heroine is forced 
to lie to save her alcoholic truck-driver father after he stabbed her student 
boyfriend. Her mother bluntly explains that the father supports the family by 
thievery and they will not have enough to live on if he goes to prison. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, much anxiety in the film industry can be traced to a general shift 
in public focus that has little to do with movies: The delicious thrill of the 
formerly forbidden has worn thin as sour dissatisfaction with the quality of 
life after three years of perestroika has grown. Gorbachev also declared that 
nationalist aspirations from the Balkans to the Baltics aired under the flag of 
glasnost might force changes in the policy "if this were to succeed in 
spreading." 
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Gorbachev insisted that the media shift from criticism of Soviet 
society's failings to cheerleading for his economic program. In place of his 
former encouragement of criticism, he chastised some members of the media for 
using the new atmosphere to settle personal scores. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing themes that Soviet conservatives have been sounding with increasing 
frequency -- and oddly echoing U.S. conservatives who blast "liberal media" -- 
the Soviet leader went on to say: 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately in our mass media, one can observe a desire to disseminate hasty 
and unfounded conclusions and opinions, and one or two people have started to 
gamble on sensationalism. And I must say frankly that a lot of lies have 
appeared. There have been very many instances of people being undeservedly 
humiliated and insulted. And most important, they do not all always have the 
chance to defend their name." 
</P>
<P>
Those remarks were made, pointedly, in a passage of the speech dealing with a 
law being drafted to regulate glasnost in the media. Gorbachev said the law 
would deal with "responsibility for the well-foundedness of our speeches and 
writings." 
</P>
<P>
In short, the media attacks had served their purpose of discrediting the 
Brezhnevites. Continuing to point out deficiencies would foster distrust in the 
leadership's ability to carry out its program. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the speech, divisions within the cultural elite surfaced 
dramatically when a letter in Pravda attacked as "scum" one of the leading 
supporters of Gorbachev's program, the magazine Ogonyok, and claimed the 
weekly's articles are often intended to slander and discredit. 
</P>
<P>
An influential film maker, Sergei Bondarchuk, was one of letter's seven 
signers. Bondarchuk, the conservative director of "War and Peace," was 
humiliated in 1986 when he failed to be elected as a delegate to the film 
makers' union meeting where the old guard was overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to this tempering of enthusiasm for glasnost, a new economic law that 
requires enterprises to generate profits is producing fear of unemployment 
throughout the economy, while a companion decree bars the movie industry and 
other media from achieving independence. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old system of quotas, Soviet film studios were required to produce 
large numbers of pictures to fulfill the state plan. But if studios only 
produce films they hope will be money-making, insiders suspect that layoffs 
will follow. 
</P>
<P>
As a hedge against unemployment, a number in the film industry have been 
sinking life-savings into film cooperatives to produce films for industry, 
public service films -- even features. 
</P>
<P>
Any dream that this would lead to Hollywood on the Moskva was rudely 
interrupted on Dec. 29, when the Council of Ministers decreed that independent 
film cooperatives, as well as unofficial printing organizations, would be 
prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the economic impact on movie workers, the unmistakable political 
fallout is that film makers, once the darlings of glasnost, had fallen from 
grace. The decree also dispels any hopes that publishing houses, even 
newspapers, might function independently. The mass media will remain state 
media. 
</P>
<P>
The third point about the state of the movie industry comes back to the 
influence of the Union of Film Makers, which has a wide-ranging but select 
membership of directors, screenwriters, performers, cameramen, set designers, 
composers, technical staff, editors and critics. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Neyman, a critically acclaimed emigre cameraman whose United States 
credits include "Liquid Sky" and "DOA," was in Moscow during late December, 
filming a PBS documentary on the exiled poet and Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. 
</P>
<P>
Top Soviet film officials explained to Neyman that a pending reorganization is 
not intended to dilute the union's power, but to streamline a setup that has 
become too cumbersome; the union is to remain as an "umbrella" organization. 
But if the practical effect of the move is the splintering of the organization, 
the creative end of the industry could lose its powerful voice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these concerns, no one is suggesting that the situation is as bad as it 
was under Brezhnev. Indeed, in his speech, Gorbachev insisted glasnost would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a litmus test of sorts from the film industry -- the documentary 
"Solovetski Power" -- it will soon be possible to gauge Gorbachev's intent. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, six survivors of the concentration camps on the Solovetski Islands 
just south of the Arctic Circle tell their harrowing stories -- and a former 
camp official attempts to justify his actions. At the USA Film Festival in Park 
City, Utah, a screening of the film on Jan. 27 left many in the audience in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, the documentary -- the first to present the camps with 
such candor -- has so far been shown only to selected audiences. The film's 
director, Marina Goldovskaya, who attended the festival, said high-level 
political authorities are weighing just how broad an audience they want for it.

A SHATTERED AFGHANISTAN FINDS NOTHING TO CELEBRATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Debra Denker, Debra Denker, who is working on a novel based on her 
experiences in Afghanistan, has produced a documentary about Afghan refugees 
and written about them for the National Geographic magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We always knew the Soviets would leave, my Afghan friends and I, but we never 
thought it would be like this, with bloody anarchy stalking 2 million civilians 
in the winter-bound capital of Kabul. Somehow our naive idealism envisioned a 
joyous triumph, a liberation, a clear victory. We joked about being "on the 
first jeep into the liberated city of Kabul," a homecoming to a city I left 
days before the Soviet invasion. Noor Jehan, a fiery-tongued, widowed refugee, 
expressed the passion of millions when she cried, "If God wills, we will run 
toward Afghanistan, we will run barefoot as fast as we can, as soon as we hear 
that our homeland is free." 
</P>
<P>
In the darkest years of the war, few foreign analysts believed the Soviets 
would ever leave. There were grim predictions of Afghanistan becoming another 
Soviet republic, or the country being split. The Soviets had never retreated 
once they invaded, pundits pointed out, so we might as well accept Afghanistan 
as lost and control the damage. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a factor that simply would not fit into statistical calculations 
and political projections: the faith of the Afghan people. They truly believed 
they could repulse the Soviets, as the people of Afghanistan had sooner or 
later repulsed every invader in their history. Those who knew the Afghans well 
knew that they really would fight "till the last breath, till the last drop of 
blood," an oft-quoted phrase. No one ever "died" in the war; he or she "was 
martyred," and thus reserved a special place in Paradise. Yet Afghan faith was 
rarely fanatical. Most fighters wanted to live to fight another day, but 
bravely accepted the possibility of martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and glasnost created a favorable 
climate for Soviet withdrawal, as the venture could be blamed on his 
predecessors. But it was the proud and lonely faith of the Afghan people that 
enabled them to go on fighting for nine years, like someone hoping to stay 
alive long enough to find a miracle drug. 
</P>
<P>
As the Soviets left, there were no jeeps rolling triumphantly into the besieged 
city of Kabul, no flowers for the moujahedeen freedom fighters, little enough 
celebration. Many mourned, for the Soviets had bombed civilians near the 
strategic Salang Tunnel just before the pullout began. The moujahedeen, not 
party to the Geneva Accords, were still fighting, tightening the noose around 
an ill-supplied city of frightened, cold, hungry civilians, many their 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will there be a mass return of the 5 million refugees in Pakistan and Iran. 
Noor Jehan will not lead her family back to her broken village, barefoot on the 
cold stones, for the Soviets have left 10 million to 30 million land mines as a 
legacy to the people of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Soviets really are leaving. Western news coverage in recent months 
has been less of heroic Afghan resistance fighters and more of anxious young 
Soviet boys in Kabul, waiting for their numbers to come up in either the death 
lottery or the home lottery. The parallels with Vietnam are chilling. 
</P>
<P>
A messy war is now turning into a messy civil war. Communists and collaborators 
scramble for available visas, as Najibullah's government stumbles without its 
Soviet prop and Afghan soldiers, mostly reluctant conscripts, are caught in the 
middle. While Najibullah continues to insist that the People's Democratic Party 
is "a major power" in Afghanistan, moujahedeen representatives are equally 
insistent that there is no place for communists in a postwar government. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen and their supporters are unlikely to be forgiving toward those 
whom they hold responsible for the deaths of a million Afghans. Unfortunately, 
it may be hard to tell who was really a collaborator and who a "good Muslim." 
Many high party officials will have the cash and connections to get out, while 
ordinary party members and young conscripts will be left to face a violent and 
unforgiving populace. 
</P>
<P>
A period of anarchy may follow the fall of Najibullah's government, as there is 
no nationally accepted leader. The Pakistan-based moujahedeen leadership 
remains fractured, despite plans to elect a transitional government. A few 
battle-proved commanders are much admired, but none universally. Many educated 
Afghans, particularly women, fear that the extreme fundamentalist faction, 
supported by the United States all these years, could establish a government 
based on an intolerant brand of Islam. Without U.S. guns and money, however, 
they are not likely to maintain the loyalty of the majority of non-fanatical 
Afghans for long. Factions may battle one another, as they have with varying 
degrees of hostility over the past nine years. The one hope is that, as the 
late poet Ustad Khalilullah Khalili said to me a few years ago, "People will 
soon tire of civil war. They have seen enough fighting and death." 
</P>
<P>
Another uncertainty is the fate of 20,000 children who were taken forcibly from 
their parents for "education" in the Soviet Union. Will they be returned to 
their families, or are they the seeds of future communist cadres? And what of 
several hundred Soviet prisoners ofwar? Will the moujahedeen release them, and 
if so, will these soldiers dare return home? 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, in all these years of covering the war and the refugees, no one I 
knew well had been killed. On my last visit to Pakistan, in December, I 
apprehensively asked about the moujahedeen who had escorted me on my two trips 
into the war zone, patient with my plodding pace, understanding of my fears. I 
sighed with relief when told they were all fine and still fighting. Then one 
night someone came and said, "I have bad news about Azim. He was martyred a few 
months ago." 
</P>
<P>
Azim Zarbakhsh, our wonderful flute-playing friend, our ecstatic Sufi with the 
long hair and the Rasputin beard. He would spout Pashtu and Farsi poetry on the 
spot, then launch into Afghan folk songs on his homemade wooden flute. He 
played in the houses of the wealthy and the rooms of the poor, preferring 
kebabs and tea to the fancy buffet dinners where he was embarrassed because he 
didn't know how to use a knife and fork. He was a wandering minstrel, a free 
spirit, a freedom fighter who died in the last months of the war. 
</P>
<P>
For the Afghans, this has been a righteous war, one they had no choice but to 
fight. Afghanistan has not known such destruction since the time of Genghis 
Khan. Observers estimate that 50% of the villages are in ruins and that roads, 
wells and irrigation systems are destroyed or fallen into disrepair. Now that 
the war is "over," now that the Afghans are no longer fighting the Soviets, but 
among themselves, the United States must support this nation of survivors in 
its efforts to rebuild. Ironically, the Soviet Union has pledged the largest 
amount so far toward reconstruction.

JOHN TOWER'S NOMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Based on personal experience, I have an offbeat reason for supporting the 
confirmation of Tower even though he has been very thick with the defense 
establishment for many years. 
</P>
<P>
During the Korean War, while serving as personnel officer of a Naval station, I 
had the additional duty of being in charge of the brig. Every one of my guards 
had a long disciplinary record. The place ran perfectly because no one could 
put anything over on those guys. 
</P>
<P>
I am not impugning Tower in any way. I am just saying that a fox can guard a 
chicken coop.

WATER PROBLEM: 'THE DRY YEARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading your editorial I was struck by the gross inequity that would be 
imposed by an across the board, mandatory 10% reduction in water usage. Last 
summer, my husband and I, along with many of our friends and neighbors, cut our 
water usage by 10%. To subsequently impose another 10% reduction on us and 
others who voluntarily complied with the program would be, not only unfair, but 
a hardship. I feel that the Department of Water and Power should either use the 
usage figures from 1987 as the base value, or should look at setting a standard 
for usage based on the size of the household and property.

JOHN TOWER'S NOMINATION

<TEXT>
<P>
Can anyone give me a sane reason why the nomination of Tower to be secretary of 
defense should be considered by the Senate Armed Services Committee for more 
than 30 seconds when over a two-year period Tower took $750,000 from companies 
doing business with the Defense Department?

So much for ethics in government!

AMAZON ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to the team of U.S. senators who are attempting to block 
construction of the road through the Amazon basin that the Japanese are funding 
("Senators Vow to Fight Japanese-Funded Amazon Road," Feb. 4, Part I). Japan's 
lack of natural resources and desire for easy shipment of the supplies should 
not lead to the destruction of one of the earth's major sources of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
Many animals indigenous to the jungles will be displaced. In addition, once the 
road opens, rare tropical animals will be in danger of extinction due to 
hunters' increased accessibility of the area. 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that the residents of the remote villages in the jungles 
of Peru and Brazil would be in favor of the road, but, as Douglas Jehl points 
out in his article, the governments of Brazil and Peru would allow further 
development and foresting for economic purposes, given the incentive. It would 
only be a matter of time before the rain forest disappeared completely if this 
were the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have already despoiled many other tropical rain forests, and they 
should be stopped before they transform the world's largest into a "concrete" 
jungle.

GORBACHEV A WIMP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Probably the last Russian leader who had to put up with press attacks while 
still in office was Aleksandr F. Kerensky, prime minister in the provisional 
government that briefly held power in 1917 between the overthrow of the Romanov 
dynasty and the Bolshevik coup d'etat. Not coincidentally, Kerensky was also 
the last -- in fact, the only -- Russian leader chosen by democratic vote. 
Democracy, in the basic sense of allowing a free choice among parties and 
candidates, still isn't on the Soviet agenda. But the taboo that has always 
insulated the Soviet Union's highest official from domestic press criticism has 
at least been set aside, if only temporarily. Mikhail S. Gorbachev now finds 
himself accused of a certain wimpishness for failing to do enough to bring 
about the reforms that he has been championing for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The attack in the political and literary monthly Neva was written by Sergei Y. 
Andreyev, a young scientist working in western Siberia. Perestroika, he writes, 
seems doomed to fail, given the opposition of the "new class" of bureaucrats in 
industry, government and the Communist Party that ignores the interests of the 
public even as it moves the country to "economic crisis and moral decline." 
What's needed, Andreyev says, is a system under which independent unions and 
political organizations can develop to provide a countervailing force to the 
party's monopoly on power. All this stops short of a demand for a multiparty 
political system, but the direction of Andreyev's thinking is clear. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the Neva article is that it seems to give semi-official 
status to what dissident intellectuals and other radical reformers have for 
some time been saying in less visible forums. These people support perestroika; 
what they fear is that its slow progress in the face of an eroding standard of 
living threatens its collapse, and they believe that this can be avoided only 
if the pace of change is drastically quickened. What should be made of the 
attack on Gorbachev himself? Perhaps very little. This would not, after all, be 
the first time he has used the public exposure of major grievances to support 
his efforts to speed reform. What bears watching now is whether the Andreyev 
article will prove a one-time thing or whether it will be taken as a sign that 
further and even more pointed public debate may now take place.

SHADES OF GERMANY'S 'UNMASTERABLE PAST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMOS PERLMUTTER, Amos Perlmutter is a professor of political science and 
sociology at American University and editor of the Journal of Strategic 
Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Jan. 30, a far right-wing party in West Berlin made a surprisingly strong 
electoral showing in the local election, capturing 11 seats in the Berlin 
Parliament, which has a total of 144 members. 
</P>
<P>
In gaining this foothold, the Republican Party, led by former Waffen SS officer 
Franz Schonhuber, also got two seats in the German Bundestag. In and of 
themselves, the numbers seem minuscule. But the development is alarming and 
indicative of Germany's continued inability to deal with its recent past. 
Bernard Andres, the party's Berlin chairman and a former policeman, called for 
a return to such traditional German values as "cleanliness and punctuality." 
</P>
<P>
The language, style and the titular leaders of this new party are strongly 
reminiscent of Germany's not-so-recent and ugly past. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, West Germany is not the only European country endowed today with 
extremist parties of both the right and the left. The right-wing National Front 
of Jean-Marie Le Pen gained over 10% of the vote in the 1986 French 
parliamentary elections. Neo-Fascists won local and national elections in 
Italy. Right-wing extremists are especially strong politically in Belgium. They 
are also an ominous presence in Britain and Spain. On the left, the Communist 
Party remains a strong political factor in France, even though it has 
experienced a period of decline there and in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Nazis and Fascists of old, the new right-wing extremists do not 
boldly advocate the formation of new political systems in the countries in 
which they operate. But their motives show up in their embrace of racist, 
anti-Semitic causes. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitism, of course, is a metaphor for all the old antis -- 
anti-liberalism, anti-parliamentarianism and anti-democracy. These days, the 
extremists have their own Untermenschen to focus on, the new wave of Asian and 
African immigrants and workers. In Great Britain, it is the Pakistanis and 
Africans. In Germany, especially in West Berlin, it is the Turkish workers. And 
in France, it is the North Africans. The postwar extremists feed on 
unemployment and xenophobia and the latent resentment of local workers who have 
to compete for jobs with the new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany, however, anti-democratic, anti-Semitic, anti-parliamentary and 
anti-socialist ideologues are also strongly reminiscent of old Nazi sentiments. 
And in Germany, such sentiments traditionally have been strongly 
anti-communist, or more precise, anti-Soviet. Thus, they represent a sort of 
nationalist-international feeling. 
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the rough and rowdy political forces of the right, the 
xenophobic Republicans of Berlin, share intellectual kinship, however 
primitive, with the more respectable professors in West Germany who are 
debating anew the meaning of Germany's recent past. 
</P>
<P>
There exists today a deep division among German historians as to the burden of 
the Nazi past and its relationship to communism, and it goes by the name of the 
Historikerstreit, or the Historian's Conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The central issue in the debate is whether or not Nazi crimes were uniquely 
German, evil in a class by itself, or whether it was comparable to and inspired 
by Stalinism, as if the Holocaust was simply a more gruesome manifestation of 
the Gulag. 
</P>
<P>
The themes of German nationalism and anti-Semitism are not that far removed 
from the West German varieties of postwar extremism, except for the fact that 
the argument is couched in academic, intellectual terms. If anything, the 
historic-philosophic debate is more extreme, albeit seemingly more reasonable. 
It suggests that the Holocaust was somehow an outcrop of Leninism-Stalinism, 
and hardly German in character. In his masterful book, "The Unmasterable Past: 
History, Holocaust and German Identity," the American historian Charles Maier 
details why Germany's recent history, and particularly the Holocaust, resists 
accommodation and explainable integration. What is unmasterable for Ernest 
Nolte, the German historian-cum-metaphysician who is credited with starting the 
Historikerstreit, is clear to extremists -- that foreigners are evil and the 
Jews are agents of Bolshevism. No self-respecting extremist today would 
suggest, say, gassing the Turkish workers, but they do advocate sending them 
back to Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Should we be alarmed by these recent developments? Probably not to a large 
extent. Nevertheless, it remains a fact that the Germans must come to terms 
with that "unmasterable past." The burden of Nazism still lies heavily on the 
German social and political consciousness, in spite of efforts by Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl to alleviate guilt. The very presence and periodic political 
successes of the extremists remind us that a nation that cannot come to terms 
with its past is a troubled nation with a troubled future.

REVISED TAX LAW NEEDED TO PUT AMERICAN CAPITAL TO WORK IN THE ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE MAROTTA, George Marotta is a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover 
Institution and a certified financial planner in Palo Alto. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone agrees that the United States is lagging badly in the competition for 
international markets. Temporarily, a declining dollar is keeping us in the 
game by making our products less expensive to foreigners. But a strong Japan 
and a soon-to-be economically unified Europe will continue to challenge our 
economic supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
What the Bush Administration adopts now as an economic game plan will be very 
important in determining whether America can remain competitive over the long 
term. 
</P>
<P>
A decrease in the capital-gains tax rate from the current maximum of 33% may 
well be the most important action we could take at this time. (Formerly, 
capital gains on properties held more than six months qualified for "long-term" 
treatment and a top capital gains tax rate of 20%.) President Bush has proposed 
a maximum rate of 15% on investments held for at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
Most economists agree that a lower capital-gains rate would increase U.S. 
savings, support the current economic expansion and increase America's 
international competitiveness. Although many will argue that such a reduction 
would favor the wealthy class, there are many reasons to support such a move: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States is disadvantaged in international competition because of 
the high cost of capital. Interest rates are high because our savings rate -- 
at about 4% of gross national product -- is one of the lowest, if not the 
lowest, among the major industrialized countries. High interest rates favor 
debt investment rather than stock ownership. The U.S. capital-gains tax rate is 
now the highest among our major competitors. This reduces our ability to 
innovate and compete. Japan, France, West Germany, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea 
all exempt long-term capital gains from taxation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A reduction in the capital-gains tax rate may actually increase tax 
revenues, according to recent academic and governmental studies. The rush to 
sell stocks at the end of 1986 in order to take advantage of the last days of 
the low 20% top rate proves that the size of the capital-gains tax base is 
highly sensitive to the tax rate. Conversely, as rates rise, individuals enter 
into fewer transactions. Thus, while more revenue is collected per dollar of 
"realized" gain, there are fewer gains realized, shrinking the tax base and 
revenues. A decrease in rates could help reduce the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reducing the capital-gains tax rate is needed to create more jobs. From 
$25,000 to $50,000 of capital is needed to create one new job. Small businesses 
with fewer than 100 employees provide most of the new employment opportunities. 
Between 1978 and 1985, the number of small company start-ups more than doubled, 
rising from 270,000 to 640,000, creating 15 million new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The formation of small businesses is very sensitive to the capital-gains tax 
rate. The number of offerings of stock in new firms has exploded every time 
there has been a reduction in the top capital-gains tax rate, as there was in 
1979 and in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although the United States is the "leader" of the capitalistic free world, 
we are very unfriendly to capital. Capital gains are taxed also at the state 
level, increasing the overall rate well above the federal maximum of 33%. 
California and New York have the highest combined rates of 39.2% and 38.6%, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Many states had budget surpluses in 1987, which were the result of heavy 
selling of common stock to take advantage of the low capital-gain tax rates 
expiring at the end of 1986. In contrast, state deficits in 1988 were the 
result of the higher rates that became effective at the beginning of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Liberals will argue that lower capital-gains taxes favor the rich. However, 
such taxes are really on the creation of wealth. This tax is a voluntary one. 
It can be avoided by not selling an asset in which a gain exists. No 
transaction, no "realized" gain, no tax! Furthermore, an asset held until death 
will escape all capital-gains taxes, as they receive a "stepped-up basis" to 
the heirs. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the 1986 capital-gains tax increase fell most disproportionately on 
the average investor. The average marginal tax rate on the capital gains faced 
by all but the highest taxpayers has more than doubled, rising to 23% from 
10.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Much of the so-called "gains" on capital are really not gains at all, but 
simply inflation. For example, while the cost-of-living index has gone up about 
200% since 1970, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was about 1000 in 
1970, would have to go 3000 just to keep up with inflation. However, if you 
bought stock in 1970 and sold it now, the government would tax the gain from 
1000 to the present level 2286, a gain of 1286 -- even though there has been no 
gain in real purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
Congress gave homeowners over 55 years old a one-time tax break on $125,000 of 
realized gain on the sale of their home to compensate for inflation gains. They 
need to apply the same treatment to common stocks, and to homeowners under 55. 
(Britain has no capital-gains tax on principal residences). 
</P>
<P>
It seems ironic that while the whole world, including China and even the Soviet 
Union, are discovering the benefits of the free markets and the advantages of 
the capitalistic system, the United States remains most unfriendly toward 
existing capital and the creation of needed new capital.

THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS AT GETTYSBURG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Abraham Lincoln delivered the following address on Nov. 19, 1863, at 
the site of the Battle of Gettysburg during the dedication of the national 
cemetery there. 
</P>
<P>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a 
new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
are created equal. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any 
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great 
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a 
final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might 
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can 
not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, 
have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will 
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the 
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It 
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- 
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which 
they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that 
these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall 
have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the 
people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.

ON VIEW: A RECORD FOR GOLDEN THIMBLE BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Already the Golden Thimble Committee of the Auxiliary of the Hospital of the 
Good Samaritan has $70,000 in patron money. That's a record, says chairwoman 
Kate Regan, who lunched with Deborah Booth, co-chairwoman, and Catherine Krell 
at the California Club last week, before the March 1 preview of their 
needlework show for exhibitors and patrons. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the 10th biannual event. More than 500 needlework entries are 
expected. Jeweler Sol Laykin is pounding out gold and jeweled thimbles for 
category winners -- as he has since the show's inception at the hospital 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Said Maxine Ridgeway, co-chairwoman of the exhibit committee (she's been 
hanging the entries and arranging the exhibits since the show began): "This 
show has consistently perpetuated itself as one of the largest and best 
needlework shows in the country." 
</P>
<P>
And that's why the auxiliary claims Golden Thimble has raised more than $1 
million. Add that to the $1 million from the auxiliary's gift shop proceeds, 
and more proceeds from the annual Valentine appeal, and it's impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Among those stitching the benefit are Hilary Mynatt, Mindy Byers, Sally 
Woodward, Carroll Sue Anawalt, Linda Posner, Shirley Benson, Dody Booth, Jan 
Clayton, Kay Meserve, Christy Bakaly, Vicki Pozzi, Vicky Strickland, Robin 
Barker and Cheryl Baker. 
</P>
<P>
PLANNED: As if on cue, Helen Bing, big benefactor of the Planned Parenthood 
Men's Dinner 10th anniversary celebration at Spago, giggled her way into the 
kitchen at the restaurant, delivered a beribboned sack for the baby Spago's 
Wolfgang and Barbara Puck are expecting in May, and found herself with a hug 
from Wolf, who had his finger in the coffee ice cream he was preparing for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
"But we did not plan it!" the famous chef laughed. 
</P>
<P>
It was a funny touch to the wall-to-wall, turn-away party crowd, there to sup 
and dine on cuisine prepared by the husbands of women who are Planned 
Parenthood members. Under the tutelage of Puck and his restaurant sous-chefs, 
Planned Parenthood's chief sous-chef Kendell Bishop, assisted by Michael Berk 
and 19 others, chopped most of the day to make pizzas, lobster on vegetable 
salad, Alaskan salmon with ginger, Sonoma lamb with black olives and Tuscan 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner committee, chaired by Diane Bishop and Karen Berk, already had lined 
up enough wines and Champagne for an army. All could only marvel at the Walter 
Mitty fantasies of chefs Hugo Standing (president of Los Angeles Planned 
Parenthood), Donald Alschuler, Dr. Harlan Amstutz, Gordon Bodek, Laurence 
Cowan, Orville Golub, Lawrence Goodman Jr., John Osgood, Ewing Seligman, Dr. 
Norman Sprague and the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Guild president Sue Allen reports the event should raise $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
When it was time to leave, each guest received a replica of Puck's trademark, a 
baseball cap with the Spago logo. Among those departing with same were Jean 
Standing, Dr. Eugene Stern and his wife, Libby, Janice Rusack, Dody and Otis 
Booth, Bob and Beth Lowe, Charlie and Nancy Munger, and Ann Petroni, who also 
carried home a tin plate of pizza, ordered up by Puck for Donald Petroni, who 
had a cold. 
</P>
<P>
VENICE BEQUEST: World Trade Bank Chairman Roy Doumani and his wife, Carol, have 
pledged to bequeath their unique Venice, Calif., house designed by artist 
Robert Graham to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A dinner Friday celebrates the landmark gift. In addition to UCLA Chancellor 
Charles and Sue Young, the guests expected are Dudley Moore (next-door neighbor 
to the Doumanis), Eli and Edye Broad, Henry and Ginny Mancini, Franklin and 
Judith Murphy, Jack Nicholson, Fred Weisman, Bob Graham and a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
VALENTINES: The Cultural Society president Leslie Kimball and Sona Rosenberg 
and Marlene Gurewitz were knee-deep in Valentine plans this last week, 
preparing for comedians Tom Dreesen and Fritz Coleman and the Lettermen to 
entertain at their Valentine Gala at the Warner Center Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: To Arrola DuBridge. She received the ARCS LITE for her "incredible 
resources" at a luncheon at Jimmy's where speakers included Julian Von 
Kalinowski and Edward C. Stone, discussing the Keck Observatory. . . .

ZAN THOMPSON: GLIMPSING THE WORLD OF THE NOMADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Vladimir N. Basilov and I have the same trouble when we travel. We miss the 
hometown newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask what I am missing, what I am longing for at home in my country, you 
would expect me to say my family. Of course, that is true, but the most sharp, 
immediate longing is for my newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
I was talking to a new-found friend, a doctor of ethnology from the Academy of 
Sciences in the Soviet Union. He lives in Moscow and is the head of the group 
of scientists who have set up the exhibit "Nomads: Masters of the Eurasian 
Steppe" at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. It is the largest 
scientific exhibit ever to be sent from the Soviet Union for Americans to 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Basilov just finished setting up the exhibit after selecting, packing and 
shepherding the hundreds of items from museums all over the Soviet Union, 
including the Hermitage. On top of that, he just finished a symposium at USC, 
where he was the star attraction for scientists from all over the world and 
where he presented a paper on nomads and their culture, history and 
civilization. He liked USC: "I felt the university's warmth from the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, he has been pushing himself so hard and is so tired he can't tell if 
the exhibit is good or not. It's good, and I told him so. It's great, 
educational, informative, colorful and fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
Basilov's eyes are hazel like looking at clear water in a copper goblet, and he 
has a smile that would warm the yurt when the wind blows unchecked across the 
steppe. The yurt is the Eurasian nomads' mobile housing, a dwelling made of a 
framework of curved staves and covered with animal hides. The yurt, like a 
giant umbrella, can sway with the wind. The yurt at the exhibit is furnished 
with brightly painted and dyed chests, beds and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The Eurasian steppe, in case your geography is as shaky as mine, is a vast, 
unbroken plain that extends 4,000 miles from Europe to China. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nomads, Basilov said, "They were a violent and proud people who swept 
out of central Asia to threaten the cities of Europe and China." They raised 
horsemanship to a superb art, making it part of their culture and their wars. 
They developed the rigid saddle and designed and made the most beautiful horse 
tack you can imagine. There is a model of one of their horses on exhibit 
wearing a bridle, halter, face shield, cinch, all of gold. The horse is stocky 
and tough for bracing himself against the sweeping winds and his coat is 
woolly. In stature, he reminds me of the Connemara pony who faces head-on into 
the cold winds off the Atlantic in the west of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
There are almost a thousand things to see in the exhibit -- gold plates that 
fronted saddles, cooking utensils, belt buckles, jewelry, tile, weapons, and 20 
or so costumed mannequins wearing elaborate costumes. 
</P>
<P>
I have always been fascinated by these wild people and my favorite is 
Tamerlane, the 14th-Century Mongol conqueror. I was delighted to see a 
reconstruction of his head, wearing a metal helmet. When he was over 60, he 
swept into India and took the city of Delhi. When he returned home, he brought 
90 elephants and used them to haul great stones to build a mosque in Samarkand. 
</P>
<P>
Tamerlane, Samarkand, Tartars -- just the words sound like the ringing of 
golden bells. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese even built the Great Wall to keep the nomads out, but they traveled 
along the Silk Road for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
Basilov's favorite subject in his rich field is shamanism. A shaman is a kind 
of priest. Basilov likes it because, "I was able to find something new in my 
field. Always, I had a feeling to study spiritual culture, religions. The 
religion teaches that there are many deities and spirits around much more 
powerful than we, the humble creatures. So we are dependent on them if there is 
too much rainfall or not enough. We all have different abilities so it is 
natural that there were people among the nomads who were better mediators than 
their fellows. Those were the shamans and they interceded in our behalf." 
</P>
<P>
We talked about the pantheism of the American Indian and Basilov said they were 
cousins to the nomads, having walked across the land where the Bering Sea now 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe I have such empathy for these wild people because of their use of animal 
designs. There is a gold belt buckle set with turquoise that once adorned a 
goodly Scythian belly. The nomads felt that animals showed the tension and 
violence they embraced and also the animals in repose showed the regal elegance 
they admired. It's a jeweled treasure of an exhibit and I made a new friend 
where I didn't have one before. 
</P>
<P>
Basilov is a fresh breeze of a man, deeply interested in his work and 
internationally recognized. He is one of those twice-blessed people who is in 
love with the profession he has chosen and that makes every day an exciting 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
He told me of the find he and his colleagues made in Siberia, a discovery of 
musical instruments, weapons, household vessels perfectly preserved for 
thousands of years in the permafrost, literally frozen in time. The find was "a 
smile of fortune," Basilov said. 
</P>
<P>
From here the nomad exhibit will go to Denver on April 16, with its outriders 
of distinguished Soviet scholars, and then to the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington. Basilov will go home from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
I hope he gets to see something of our town. One of the museum staff is 
planning on taking him on the Universal Studio tour. He wants to see the Getty 
Museum. It's hard to plan an itinerary for a man who works a few blocks from 
the Hermitage. Anyway, I hope he enjoys the Valentine chocolates I gave him. I 
owe him. He's one of those people blessed with the ability to make you feel 
smarter than you are. 
</P>
<P>
Special reservations are required for nomads. For information please call (213) 
744-6292. Reservations are available to the public. Also, on Feb. 26, a troupe 
called Past Times With Good Company will set up a living encampment called 
"Yurts, Yaks and Yogurt," on the lawn of the Natural History Museum. They will 
be costumed as nomads and will display weaving, embroidery, wood carving and 
horsemanship.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS MAY REALLY BE PHYSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: As a current college student who was once considered to have an 
attention deficit disorder and was also thought to be hyperactive, I would like 
to add something to the discussion of this problem. Briefly, my "problem," if 
you can call it that, disappeared when I got eyeglasses. I learned that my 
vision was so poor when I was younger that I couldn't even see the blackboard. 
How could I not have problems in school when I couldn't see properly? I think 
parents and doctors should consider that something of this nature may need 
correcting before a child is labeled as having an attention deficit disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Thanks for your letter. Inattentiveness and hyperactivity are not 
necessarily symptoms of an attention deficit disorder. Medical problems that 
might explain a child's behavior should first be considered and excluded before 
a diagnostic label is pinned on a child. 
</P>
<P>
As you indicate, impaired vision or impaired hearing may account for a child's 
inattentiveness. Rather than diagnosing such a child as being hyperactive or as 
having an attention deficit disorder, steps should be taken to resolve the 
underlying medical problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: My brother-in-law had a bad case of asthma, so the doctor gave him 
corticosteroids which made him better in only a short time. I would like to 
know why other people who have asthma are not treated with corticosteroids when 
they have an attack, since it seems to work so well. A: A decision to use 
corticosteroids to treat asthma depends on the patient's condition. 
Corticosteroids, like other medications, are associated with both benefits and 
risks. One benefit, as you have seen, is its value in the management of severe 
asthma. However, the use of corticosteroids also carries some risk, including 
facial disfigurement; the development of depression, insomnia or euphoria; 
gastrointestinal problems; and fluid retention. Therefore it cannot be used 
indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of a life-threatening emergency, these risks become less important 
compared with the benefits of treatment. I assume this explains the use of 
corticosteroid therapy for your brother-in-law, and its lack of use in other 
patients with less severe asthma. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Would you please explain how a woman could get a fracture without falling or 
being in an accident of some kind? I've been told that these kinds of fractures 
do happen. 
</P>
<P>
A: Atraumatic fractures may be caused by such common events as twisting, 
sneezing or coughing. As might be expected, the fractures occur most often in 
older women who have a low bone density. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I know that animals can be the cause of an allergy, but can dead animals 
also cause an allergy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Allergic reactions have been reported in people, such as hunters, who have 
had contact with dead animals. These symptoms may mistakenly be attributed to 
the presence of outdoor allergens. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I had been thinking of getting a kerosene heater for my home, but a friend 
of mine told me that he had heard it was not a good idea because it would make 
the air in the house bad. But I know someone else who has had a kerosene heater 
for a good long time, and he and his family have not had any problems. I don't 
see how it's possible for a heater to be good for some people but not for 
others, and I would appreciate it if you would clear this up. 
</P>
<P>
A: The results of one study on the effects of kerosene heaters suggested that 
while they may affect the quality of the air in a home, this does not seem to 
pose a hazard to healthy individuals. On the other hand, a person who has 
asthma, for example may be adversely affected by the use of a kerosene heater 
in the home. In this sense, use of the heater may in fact be acceptable for one 
family but not for another. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It seems to me that women are discriminated against even when it comes to 
something like herpes. I've heard that women can be more badly affected by 
herpes than men, and I'd like to know what can cause herpes to flare up after 
it hasn't caused any problems for several months, if not years. 
</P>
<P>
A: Herpes simplex virus may be reactivated by such stimuli as emotional stress, 
fever and sunlight. It carries a particular risk for women because it has been 
found to be associated with an increased incidence of cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
More indirectly, herpes simplex in a pregnant woman may dictate a Caesarean 
delivery in order to avoid exposing the infant to lesions in the vaginal canal. 
Because this involves major surgery, the risk to the woman is again increased. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm long past my adolescence but I have a reason for asking this question. I 
would like to know whether the fact that an adolescent boy had a homosexual 
experience means that he will have such a life style in his later years. 
</P>
<P>
A: Many adolescent boys entertain thoughts about homosexual activities and some 
engage in such activities. However, this does not necessarily mean that they 
will adopt this sexual preference in later life. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to increase the amount of calcium I have in my diet, but at the 
same time I would like to stay away from dairy products because I have a slight 
problem with cholesterol. Would you have any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A: Dairy products are not the only source of calcium. Try adding dark green 
leafy vegetables to your diet. You can include broccoli, spinach and Brussels 
sprouts, all of which contain calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even dairy products you use do not have to contain high cholesterol. 
Use low-fat products such as skim milk or low-fat yogurt or cheese instead of 
whole milk and cream. You can also use skim milk in hot cereals and soups.

ON AGING: DEALING WITH CANCER AS PATIENT, FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Cancer Institute has developed four booklets that help people with 
their feelings and fears. These booklets give practical tips on dealing with 
cancer and its treatment to patients, families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Radiation Therapy and You" describes common types of radiation therapy and its 
side effects. "Chemotherapy and You" tells patients what to expect and offers 
self-help tips for managing side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"Eating Hints" stresses the importance of eating well during cancer treatment 
and provides simple and menus. "Taking time: Support for People with Cancer and 
the People Who Care About Them" discusses the emotions patients and families 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's free booklets should be required reading for anyone with cancer 
as well as their families and friends. To order the series, call (800) 
4-CANCER, or write to the Office of Cancer Communication, National Cancer 
Institute, Building 31, Bethesda, Md. 20892.

Question: Four years ago, my parents purchased a long-term-care insurance 
policy. Recently my 87-year-old mother had to go into a nursing home and my 
father moved in with us. When we spoke to the insurance agent about coverage, I 
was amazed to learn that the plan was riddled with exclusions and barely paid 
for anything. Were my parents fraudulently treated? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Unfortunately, most private long-term-care insurance policies don't 
provide comprehensive coverage, and many fall short of the mark in covering 
basics. 
</P>
<P>
Private long-term-care insurance was first sold in the 1970s. However, the 
majority of policies have been written in the past four years. About 500,000 
policies have been sold to older Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of North Carolina examined 75 long-term-care 
insurance plans and options. They found that 82% had severe restrictions in 
coverage, making it hard for beneficiaries to collect. A $50-a-day benefit was 
considered inadequate to meet costs incurred by care in a nursing home. 
Premiums for long-term-care policies range from $400 to $1,200 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners has recommended changes in 
long-term-care insurance policies: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coverage for a minimum of 24 consecutive months of care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No requirement of prior institutionalization. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A limitation on pre-existing conditions that can negate the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No cancellation on the basis of age or health of the insured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A designated period in which the policyholder can return the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Disclosure of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
When buying any insurance, consumers need to shop around, asking for a 
disclosure of benefits explaining the policy's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
If you believe fraud was committed in the selling of your parents' policy, 
contact the office of the state insurance commission. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm a 61-year-old woman concerned about maintaining my health for as many 
years as possible. I read that bee pollen promotes good health and alfalfa can 
cure arthritis. Are these claims true? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The dietary products you cited are two of a number of fraudulent product 
claims aimed at older Americans. A report by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop 
warns against wasting your money on these and other food-quackery claims, such 
as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Superoxide dismutase, a naturally occurring enzyme sold over the counter, 
and the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the basic building blocks of life that can 
be taken orally, as "anti-aging remedies." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ginseng, a Chinese herb, as a curative for many ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lecithin, a waxy substance widely found in plants and animals, combined 
with vinegar, kelp and Vitamin B-6 for the prevention and cure of heart disease 
and weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Para-aminobenzoic acid, a member of the B vitamin family, as an essential 
or curative nutrient. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pangamic acid, so-called vitamin B-15, as an essential nutrient. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 report by the Subcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care of the House 
Select Committee on Aging indicated that quackery costs the public more than 
$10 billion a year. According to Koop, federal regulatory agencies don't have 
the resources to combat food quackery.

SKI THE 'OLD LINK' TRAIL BETWEEN HUTS IN COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. WURMSTEDT, Wurmstedt is a senior reporter for the Fort Worth 
(Tex.) Star-Telegram. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ASPEN, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You must absolutely remember one thing: Bring along a pair of skins. Second, 
don't consider this adventure unless you are in pretty good shape . . . or have 
someone to carry your backpack for you. 
</P>
<P>
Without skins, we may never have made the climb up to McNamara Hut. Skins are 
thin strips of plastic you attach to the bottom of your cross-country skis. 
They give you enough traction to ski uphill with a heavy pack on your back. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara is one of five huts on a network of about 10 miles of ski trails that 
make up what is known as the "old link" of the Tenth Mountain Division 
Cross-Country Ski Trail and Hut System near Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
A separate "new link," connecting four new huts on another 100 miles of trails, 
opened this season near Vail. 
</P>
<P>
Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, a part-time Aspen resident, donated 
money for the hut that bears his name and anoth er, called Margy's Hut, in 
honor of his deceased wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
Both links, or trails, wind through the White River National Forest in some of 
the most beautiful country in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The views of craggy, snow-covered peaks are breathtaking. Deep woodlands, where 
the boughs of big pine trees bend under the weight of snow, offer a sense of 
solitude and peace. 
</P>
<P>
Some hardy souls spend a week in the mountains, skiing from hut to hut, 
including a night along the way at a guest ranch called the Diamond J, which is 
on the old link. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popularity Growing 
</P>
<P>
I selected a condensed version: a one-nighter to McNamara and back to Aspen the 
next day with friends who live in Aspen and are veteran back-country skiers. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of back-country, hut-to-hut skiing is growing, and my trip was a 
good introduction. Before leaving we spent part of the morning in Aspen 
debating how much food to carry, trying to keep our packs as light as possible. 
</P>
<P>
My friends warned that while the trip was strenuous, we'd want to eat like 
bears once we reached the hut. 
</P>
<P>
We started out in a wet snowfall, skiing up the Hunter Creek drainage northeast 
of town. We followed the trail through stands of aspen trees and on into 
mountains known as the Williams range. 
</P>
<P>
The distance to the hut was 5.4 miles, including a respectable climb of 1,980 
feet, from an elevation of 8,320 feet in Aspen to 10,300 feet at the hut. Most 
of the trail was narrow and uphill, along steep ridges. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us needed our skins nearly all the way. We crossed two alpine meadows, 
but most of the trip was through forest. 
</P>
<P>
The tracks left in the snow by earlier skiers brought to mind the tracks of the 
narrow-gauge railroads that once ran through these mountains during mining 
booms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signs on Trees 
</P>
<P>
The trails on the Tenth Mountain system are marked by blue diamond signs on 
trees and are easy to follow, although the association recommends that skiers 
carry maps and compasses in case of bad weather. Guides are not necessary, but 
can be arranged through the association. 
</P>
<P>
Our group of six skiers quickly spread out on the trail according to individual 
skiing ability and condition. Bonnie Williams, director of sports medicine at 
the chic Aspen Club, zipped up to the hut in just 2 1/2 hours. It took me four 
hours to reach the hut, maintaining what, for me, was a strong, steady pace. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wonderful trip, though I was exhausted at the end. Although I'm a 
jogger and in pretty good shape, I think the altitude and the 35-pound pack on 
my back made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, an intermediate skier should have no trouble on most parts of the 
Tenth Mountain system. 
</P>
<P>
I sank onto a bunk, gulped orange juice and quickly recovered. But I didn't 
feel the urge to join Williams when she led a group out to practice ski turns 
on a hillside near the hut. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, "hut" is a misnomer. Like the other huts on the Tenth Mountain 
network, McNamara is a big, beautiful, well-built, two-story log cabin with 
pine paneling and big picture windows. 
</P>
<P>
McNamara can sleep 15 skiers. There is one private sleeping room and a few 
bunks by one of the two woodburning stoves downstairs, plus a large dorm room 
upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Woodburning Saunas 
</P>
<P>
Some of the newer private huts incorporated into the system this season are 
more elaborate. Two have woodburning saunas. One has hot and cold running 
water, and another a gas-fueled cooking stove. But none have on-site staffs. 
</P>
<P>
The bunks have foam mattresses and pillows. So just bring a pillowcase with 
your sleeping bag. The huts have garage-sale-quality pots, pans, plates and 
silverware. You don't even need your Swiss army knife. 
</P>
<P>
At McNamara there is a woodburning cookstove in the kitchen area and a sink for 
washing dishes with melted snow. There is no running water. Outhouses are out 
back. McNamara has a solar-powered lighting system that gave us electric light 
in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Our meal that night consisted of fruit, cheese, bread and the low-calorie meals 
that come in plastic pouches. We ate around the hut's big picnic-style tables. 
</P>
<P>
We were joined by a group of five men and a woman who were on a six-day 
hut-to-hut tour. They also had reserved bunks at McNamara that night. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner I relaxed on my bunk near one of the stoves. The last thing I 
remember before dozing off was hearing one member of our group reciting a 
rendition of "The Cremation of Sam McGee," by Robert Service. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning we woke to find a clear blue sky and a foot of new powder. 
Fueled by pancakes and coffee, we zoomed through a winter wonderland of pine 
trees and deep snow downhill to Aspen. The trip back was exhilarating, and took 
me only an hour and 45 minutes, sans skins. 
</P>
<P>
The trail and hut system is named after the Tenth Mountain Division ski troops, 
who trained near Aspen and fought in Europe during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The Tenth Mountain Trail Assn., a nonprofit organization, was established in 
Aspen in 1980. It maintains the huts and gathers firewood during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the nine huts are owned by the association. Three huts are privately 
owned, but can be reserved through the association. Cost varies from $16 to $25 
per person per night. 
</P>
<P>
You will probably share a hut with others who have reserved bunks in that hut 
the same night. Entire huts may be reserved, however. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for a night at the Diamond J, which has a Jacuzzi, saunas and showers, 
is $22 per night, or $44.50 with three meals, including a carry-out lunch for 
the trail, if you prefer. 
</P>
<P>
The Tenth Mountain Assn. is based in Aspen and maintains an office in Vail. 
Reservations for both links of the trail are made through the Aspen office. 
</P>
<P>
The association's reservation desk is open from October through April, 8 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and a brochure, contact the association at 1280 Ute Ave., 
Aspen, Colo., 81611, (303) 925-5775. Weekend nights should be reserved well in 
advance. The Aspen office also can provide maps, plus information on the 
privately owned huts and the various trailhead locations. 
</P>
<P>
The privately owned huts and the Diamond J also take their own reservations. 
Their telephone numbers are available from the association. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which eventually hopes to expand its trails to connect Aspen 
and Vail on the two links, accepts memberships and contributions.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: SANTA FE: MONUMENTAL BRONZE SCULPTURES FROM SHIDONI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Browsers and buyers can surround themselves with fine art of every sort in 
Santa Fe. Galleries showcase a variety of realistic and abstract contemporary 
works as well as avant-garde, Native American and Western traditional painting, 
graphics and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
One of Santa Fe's most fascinating places is Shidoni, a sculpture gallery and 
foundry in the romantically rustic and fashionable suburb of Tesuque. 
</P>
<P>
Shidoni is one of the nation's largest and most prestigious bronze-sculpture 
foundries, and has produced many of America's major works of art. 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans are familiar with Shidoni's monumental sculptures but lack any 
knowledge of the foundry. For example, Shidoni produced the beautiful bronze 
Bruin that sits in the middle of the UCLA campus. It was sculpted by artist 
Billy Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, Napa Valley's "The Grape Crusher," a 15-foot bronze 
statue designed by Eugene Miles, was made at Shidoni. Cast in 110 pieces, it 
took about eight months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
The "Pentaceratops Sternbergii," a 21-foot dinosaur designed by sculptor David 
A. Thomas for the New Mexico Museum of Natural History in Albuquerque, weighs 
24,000 pounds and was cast in 80 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Playground for Youths 
</P>
<P>
Shidoni shows the foundry's monumental works (those for sale and commissioned 
pieces waiting for transportation) in two beautiful sculpture gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Gigantic arches and columns are painted in bright colors, Westerners ride 
horseback, Native Americans are imposing statues and wildly abstract shapes 
with amusing titles, all displayed in grassy fields against a background of 
lush greenery. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a little creek running through the gardens, where visitors can 
picnic, providing they clean up. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery holds its famous outdoor sculpture show every year from June 
through September. The show features bronze, steel, stone and wooden sculptures 
collected from across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Bronze Pieces 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shidoni makes, shows and sells small works. The foundry's smaller 
bronze pieces, as well as sculptures in wood and other materials, along with 
some two-dimensional paintings and drawings, are displayed in a modern 
5,000-square-foot indoor gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Designed specifically to show sculpture, the gallery has high ceilings, takes 
full advantage of natural light and has a helpful and knowledgeable staff. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery has small one- and two-person shows or larger group shows on a 
rotating basis, and represents a wide range of artists and styles. 
</P>
<P>
You can see Dallas-based sculptor Liz Hart's young dancer in "Rehearsal" 
($12,000), Robert Summer's "Western Legacy" (the original model for the 
sculpture at the Houston Astrodome; 30 copies were made and sell for $12,500 
each), Barry Coffin's "Another Good Indian" (an edition of 15, each $3,000) and 
Charles Ringer's kinetic abstraction "Maze," $4,000. Other limited-edition 
pieces are available for about $800 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't buy anything, visiting Shidoni may be a special treat, 
especially if you go on Saturday afternoons when you can watch artisans heating 
the bronze to 2,000 degrees and carefully pouring the glowing metal into 
sculpture molds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Copies Are Exact 
</P>
<P>
The foundry uses the ancient "lost wax" method, a complicated procedure by 
which works in wax, clay or wood are copied exactly in durable bronze (an alloy 
of copper, silicone and manganese). 
</P>
<P>
The foundry was founded in 1971 by Tommy Hicks, a Texas sculptor who had been 
employed for 20 years as a petroleum chemist. Hicks wanted to concentrate on 
sculpture full time, and the call of a fledgling Santa Fe arts organization 
that needed a foundry turned out to be Hicks' calling. 
</P>
<P>
He left his job, sold his piano for $350 to finance the trip West and settled 
on a 75-acre ranch just north of Santa Fe. He began the foundry in a 
dilapidated chicken coop. It has grown into a huge modern plant that does about 
$2 million a year in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks explains that Shidoni is a Navajo word of greeting. He selected the name 
because he's "from Texas and friendly, and it would have been too hokey to call 
it the Howdy Foundry." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its size and reputation, the foundry has kept its down-to-earth, 
family-like and friendly atmosphere.

CRUISE VIEWS: CARNIVAL BUYS UP HOLLAND AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch are Los Angeles free-lance 
writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the volatile last quarter of 1988, cruise lines in the rapidly changing 
industry seemed to be jockeying for position for the 1990s. Carnival Cruise 
Lines' recent $625-million purchase of Holland America and its holdings set off 
still another bombshell in a series of power plays as lines continue to merge 
and consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami a Carnival spokesman said his line has no intention of "Carnivalizing" 
the Holland America ships or grafting any of their earmarks onto the "fun 
ships." 
</P>
<P>
"They control Alaska in the summer, we control the Caribbean in the summer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By 1992 Holland America was expecting to have 9,300 berths, counting two new 
ships in preliminary planning, which would have put the line in strong 
competition with Carnival Cruise Lines. Holland America also had recently 
acquired full ownership of Windstar Sail Cruises, a Miami-based, three-vessel 
company offering luxury 156-passenger computerized sailing cruises in the 
Caribbean, French Polynesia and the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Mergers 
</P>
<P>
This season has already seen the former Sitmar ships assimilated into the 
Princess/P&amp;O fleet. Exploration Cruise Line (seven small adventure ships) 
and Connecticut-based American Cruise Line (three ships) have discontinued 
operation after filing under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code for 
protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Odyssey has become the Regent Sun, the Sun Princess the Star/Ship 
Majestic, the Star/Ship Royale the Dolphin SeaBreeze, and Home Line's Atlantic 
the Star/Ship Atlantic. Barring any 11th-hour sales the Astor should turn into 
the Feodor Dostoyevski any day now. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-November we witnessed one of the smoothest transitions among the 
quick-change vessels. Holland America's new Westerdam, the former Homeric from 
the now-defunct Home Line, began Caribbean service from Ft. Lauderdale after 
less than two weeks of renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Port facilities, which have been lagging behind cruise lines in adapting to the 
busy market, are finally beginning to catch up. Disembarkation at Ft. 
Lauderdale's new terminal, combined with Delta Airlines' pier-side baggage 
check-in and the greatly improved passenger facilities at the nearby Ft. 
Lauderdale airport, provide the fastest and smoothest cruise ship-to-flight 
transition we can remember. 
</P>
<P>
For Holland America, purchase of the 2-year-old German-built Westerdam offered 
1,140 new berths in their heavily advertised Caribbean and Alaska markets, 
currently served by the Rotterdam, Noordam and Nieuw Amsterdam. It also 
attracted about 500 loyal Holland America repeat passengers who came to check 
out the new ship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enlargement Planned 
</P>
<P>
Plans are still in force for the Westerdam to be enlarged late this year by 
being cut in half, with the two sections floated apart and a 140-foot, 11-deck 
prefabricated section dropped into the center to lengthen it and add 400 
berths. 
</P>
<P>
It fits well into Holland America's present fleet, offering bigger-than-average 
cabins, some with double beds and/or bathtubs, and a sense of solid comfort and 
value throughout. Changes so far have been mostly cosmetic, with the 
traditional dark-blue hull, white stack and logo replacing Home's colors, and 
the decks and public rooms renamed to conform to Holland America's traditions. 
</P>
<P>
One feature not found on the other Dutch ships is a handsome sheltered and 
tiled pool area with sliding glass cover amidships on the top deck. 
</P>
<P>
While the line continues to represent high quality and solid value for the 
money, there's nothing stodgy about the operation. The entertainment is better 
than ever, with two sparkling shows created for the Westerdam by Broadway 
veteran Jack Eddleman, one a tribute to Cole Porter, the other well-woven 
highlights of three Andrew Lloyd Webber blockbusters: "Evita," "Cats" and 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
Cuisine continues to keep pace with current tastes with more main dish choices, 
including fish, chicken and vegetarian entrees, lighter dishes and optional spa 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fitness Packages 
</P>
<P>
The Bonaventure Spa at Sea program just introduced on the Westerdam, as well as 
on the Noordam and Nieuw Amsterdam, takes seagoing fitness one step further by 
selling an all-inclusive package with massages, luffa treatments, special 
low-calorie menus and salon beauty treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Supervised by counselors trained at the Ft. Lauderdale spa, the program and 
cruise costs from $2,335 to $2,435 per person double occupancy for seven days, 
depending on the season, for a deluxe outside stateroom. 
</P>
<P>
Honeymooners like the ship's Sunday departures and special gifts, while 
nostalgia buffs enjoy the special photography studio created for Holland 
America by Trans Ocean Photos of New York that makes old-fashioned sepia-toned 
portraits of passengers in period settings and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for the seven-day Caribbean sailings on the Westerdam, through the end 
of April, begin at $1,295, per person double occupancy, for a fairly large 
inside double with two lower beds; round-trip air fare is included. An economy 
outside double, again spacious for the price range, starts at $1,425 per 
person. Deluxe cabins and suites are also available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alternate Sailings 
</P>
<P>
The Westerdam alternates seven-day eastern and western Caribbean sailings out 
of Ft. Lauderdale; they can be combined for a 14-day cruise. Ports of call 
include San Juan, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and Freeport on the eastern schedule, 
and Ocho Rios, Grand Cayman, Playa del Carmen and Cozumel on the western. 
</P>
<P>
A transcanal sailing May 7 will reposition the Westerdam for its maiden Alaska 
season beginning May 25. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the Alaska season a transatlantic voyage sets out from 
Vancouver Sept. 24 and winds up Oct. 26 at the shipyard in Emden, West Germany, 
where the Westerdam will be stretched. Prices for the full voyage start at a 
low $5,595 for 41 days, but segments as short as 10 days are available. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
For the record: The correct phone number for Seabourn Cruise Line is (800) 
351-9595. Due to a typographical error in a company press release, the number 
was listed incorrectly in the Jan. 15 Cruise Views column.

AID FOR THOSE AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers who run into trouble abroad naturally find it distressing, and for 
the family back home it can be equally worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
A friend, for example, was trapped in Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Her 
parents were frantic, unable to get through to her (or she to them) because of 
security on telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
As it transpired, she was safe in a hotel on the outskirts of Haifa. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, another friend was in Jamaica when Hurricane Gilbert hit last 
fall. Again, there were agonizing hours of uncertainty as members of his family 
tried to get through to his hotel, only to find that the lines were down. 
</P>
<P>
He, too, was safe. But for a desperately long time, people closest to him 
didn't know anything. 
</P>
<P>
In another instance in 1985, the son of friends decided to "find himself . . . 
maybe write a book" in the northern part of the Canadian Yukon. With a warm 
coat, stout shoes and a backpack, he took off on his great adventure, 
promising, of course, to keep in touch. 
</P>
<P>
Typical teen-ager that he was, he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks went by, then months, and not a word from the young man. His parents were 
beside themselves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Communing With Nature 
</P>
<P>
Here again, the story had a happy ending. He was living in a tiny makeshift 
logging village, communing with nature and the locals, quite safe and having a 
whale of a time. 
</P>
<P>
But there wasn't a telephone within 100 miles and, as he later said, there 
wasn't exactly a post office on every corner, either. 
</P>
<P>
What do you do when you're at home and you are concerned about the welfare of a 
relative or friend who was last heard of abroad and who, you believe, may be in 
danger? 
</P>
<P>
Meet the State Department's Overseas Citizens Service, which comprises the 
Citizens Consular Service and the Citizens Emergency Center. OCS, a branch of 
the State Department's Consular Affairs Bureau, just celebrated its 10th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The OCS considers itself the government's "people's desk," serving individual 
Americans, while the State Department takes care of broad policy and 
government-to-government contacts. 
</P>
<P>
When a war breaks out overseas or when a natural catastrophe occurs, the OCS, 
through the Citizens Emergency Center, goes into action, establishing contact 
with the appropriate U.S. embassy or consulate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provides Assistance 
</P>
<P>
The first aim is to determine the condition of any Americans who may be in the 
area and to provide assistance and information to their families. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, of course, there is no natural or man-made catastrophic event. In 
the case of the young man in the Yukon wilderness, his parents, had they known 
of its existence, could have called the center and asked for aid. 
</P>
<P>
The specialists at the center would have contacted the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police and other branches of the Canadian government that could help. They also 
would have contacted the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa, so that it could take whatever 
steps at a local level. 
</P>
<P>
The Mounties claim that they always get their man. The Citizens Emergency 
Center has a pretty good record in that regard too. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? It's had a lot of practice. 
</P>
<P>
In its 10-year history the Center has processed 1.5 million "welfare and 
whereabouts" requests. It has assisted the families of 33,000 Americans 
arrested abroad, some of whom eventually went to jail, in which case the CEC 
remains the liaison between prisoner and family. 
</P>
<P>
The Overseas Citizens Service gets involved in some of the saddest events ever 
to befall Americans. One of its first jobs, for example, was to provide aid to 
the families of the 900 victims of the Jonestown, Guyana, mass suicide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Matters 
</P>
<P>
The OCS also offers, through the Citizens Consular Service, simpler, more 
routine assistance. It will arrange money transfers from families to Americans 
stranded abroad, and will expedite government loans in some situations -- $5.5 
million since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The Citizens Emergency Center telephone line -- (202) 647-5225 -- is staffed 
from 8:15 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time Monday through Friday, and from 9 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. Saturday. At other times call the main State Department Operations 
Center at (202) 634-3600. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the Citizens Consular Service, call (202) 647-3444 during the same 
hours.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: PLENTY OF HOTELS OFFERING SENIOR DISCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL, Kovell is a veteran journalist in seniors' interests. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hotel industry continues to court the mature traveler with special rates 
and packages. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the elegant Four Seasons Hotel, a lavish Newport Beach property 
not yet 2 years old, is offering a 35% discount to mature travelers from age 
55, which brings its basic room rate down to $120 single or double. The offer 
is good through the end of 1989. For information or reservations, call 
toll-free (800) 332-3442. 
</P>
<P>
Another entry on the South Coast is the Little Inn on the Bay, by the water in 
Newport Beach Harbor. It is offering Senior Saver rates until May 15 for guests 
over 55. 
</P>
<P>
All 30 guest rooms at the inn have been fully restored to resemble New England 
inns from the 1800s. Guests receive a complimentary breakfast of fresh fruit 
and pastries with coffee or tea, wine and cheese during the cocktail hour, and 
a bay cruise of Newport Harbor. A complimentary snack of milk and cookies is 
served at bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Rooms Reduced 
</P>
<P>
For mature travelers, deluxe queen rooms are reduced 20% to $71 for one or two 
persons, while channel and bay suites are marked down 25% to $96 and $112, 
respectively. For information or brochures, call toll-free (800) 438-4466, or 
write to Little Inn on the Bay, 617 Lido Park Drive, Newport Beach 92663. 
</P>
<P>
Midway between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, the 46-room Sun Time Inn in the 
southern Utah city of St. George is offering mature travelers a 25% discount 
Sunday through Thursday, from now to June 1. After that the reduced rate will 
apply seven nights a week. With the discount, the price will average $30 a 
night, single or double. 
</P>
<P>
No smoking is permitted in the clean and airy guest rooms. The inn has a 
swimming pool, and some rooms have kitchenettes. Two nearby restaurants offer 
senior discounts. 
</P>
<P>
St. George is the gateway to Zion and Bryce national parks and Cedar Breaks 
National Monument, and leads to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. It is also 
near Utah's Brian Head ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
For more information or reservations, call toll-free (800) 237-6253, or write 
to Sun Time Inn, 420 E. St. George Blvd., St. George, Utah 84770. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restored Village 
</P>
<P>
In New England the Mystic Hilton in Mystic, Conn., is offering a modestly 
priced package for mature travelers interested in visiting Mystic Seaport, a 
full-size waterfront village re-created in the style of life typical of the 
mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
The village has a collection of more than 300 historic vessels and 17 acres of 
homes, buildings, exhibit galleries, a working shipyard and other indoor and 
outdoor exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
The Hilton's Seniors Package, available for those 65 and over, is $104.65 per 
couple and includes one night's lodging, a deluxe dinner for two with a bottle 
of wine, tickets to the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, discount shopping at 
various Mystic Seaport merchants and all taxes and gratuities. 
</P>
<P>
Extra nights on this package are $32.65 per couple, with a maximum stay of two 
additional nights. Arrival must be Sunday through Thursday. For more 
information, call toll-free (800) 826-8699 or write to Mystic Hilton, Coogan 
Boulevard, Mystic, Conn. 06355. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico Travel Advisors is again offering the Golden Pass program, which 
provides visits to three of Mexico's most popular destinations -- Mexico City, 
Taxco and Acapulco, as well as a spa resort in Tehuacan. Room rates are from 
$16.63 to $20 per person a night, including two meals daily. Prices are based 
on stays of two or four weeks, which may be divided among any of the four 
destinations. 
</P>

Excellence is an assumed standard in the "All-Suite Hotel Guide," by Pamela 
Lanier. The book lists more than 800 places that offer such amenities as 
separate bedrooms, microwave kitchenettes, in-room spas and wood-burning 
fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Business types, the primary users of the all-suite accommodations, are being 
joined by families whose children can watch TV in one room while the folks 
adjourn to another with their own TV. Also, breakfast in the room helps create 
a relaxing, homelike atmosphere. Most of all, the hotels offer abundant 
recreational facilities and superb cuisine on the grounds or nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The guide is cross-referenced and arranged alphabetically by state, and within 
a state by cities and towns. Prices, amenities, locations and distances from 
key attractions are detailed. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of staying in a suite is just a little more than the price of an 
ordinary room (John Muir: $13.95). 
</P>
<P>
More than a few who have skied Vail and thought it was too fragmented have 
changed their minds after discovering the "Insider's Guide to Skiing Vail" by 
Craig Sparks, in conjunction with longtime residents and former ski school 
instructors Terry Silverly and Ben Rose. The book is much more than a how-to 
manual, with its suggestions and tips for getting the most from Vail's vast 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
The guide includes nine illustrated maps, with ratings of 126 trails according 
to six levels of ability. It also describes lifts, trails, lengths and vertical 
drops. Its compact size makes it ideal to carry along for quick reference. 
</P>
<P>
It's available for $14.95 from most ski retailers or rental shops, or add $1.50 
for handling and send to Quandry Peak, 2040 Meidinger Tower, Louisville, Ky. 
40202. If you're in a hurry, call toll-free (800) 336-3367, extension 801. 
</P>
<P>
"The Best Spas" by Theodore B. Van Itallie MD and Leila Hadley is a vacation 
guide on where to go for weight loss, fitness programs and pure pleasure in the 
United States and abroad. It helps you choose the spa for your specific needs. 
</P>
<P>
The guide lists the advantages of each spa, including monitored programs, 
fitness assessments, motivation, change of pace and opportunities to 
concentrate. The no-frills budget spas are reviewed, as well as the lavish 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The book offers some exciting vacation alternatives to help solve the 
where-shall-we-go-next syndrome (Harper &amp; Row: $21.95). 
</P>
<P>
"22 Days in California: The Itinerary Planner" by Roger Rapoport encourages 
exchanging the interstate highways for treks into more exotic areas. The 22-day 
format skips the predictable tourist traps and directs you to a plethora of 
more personable and affordable accommodations. There are maps, daily plans, 
sightseeing highlights and driving directions that include above-average 
cultural insights. The book provides a choice of trip options if you have fewer 
than three weeks. The rating system details priorities to potential 
destinations, allowing for time out to enjoy some gourmet food or taste the 
bubbly on a winery tour. Following the same format, John Muir Publications also 
has two similar guides -- "22 Days in Hawaii" by Arnold Schuchter and "22 Days 
in Europe" by Rick Steves. All three are $6.95.

MAKING A PILGRIMAGE TO COLORFUL, REMOTE CHINA 
</P>

Daily in Beijing.

YUNJINGHONG, China 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest lure of the Xishuangbanna region is that it is so hard to 
get to. 
</P>
<P>
A remote, unspoiled corner of southwest China just above the Laos-Burma border, 
the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has been officially open to 
tourists since mid-1985, but only in the last 18 months have transportation and 
bureaucratic restrictions improved enough to make the trip feasible. 
</P>
<P>
The geographical remoteness, and because Xishuangbanna (pronounced 
shee-shwahng-ba-na) is home to about 24 of China's 55 officially recognized 
ethnic minority groups, are the two main reasons why the area is gaining in 
popularity for travelers who love a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Han Chinese, who make up 95% of China's population, are only one-third of 
Xishuangbanna's. Another third of the region's 600,000 people is the Dai ethnic 
group. Hani, Bulang, Jinuo and other small groups make up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna is quite unlike the rest of China. The ubiquitous concrete block 
apartment buildings and drab shops of China's big cities are here Dai 
thatched-roof homes, built on stilts to escape monsoon flooding, and lush 
natural surroundings, including an estimated 5,000 varieties of tropical 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Groups Have Advantage 
</P>
<P>
Most people travel to Xishuangbanna in groups. Individual travel is possible if 
you're lucky enough to get onto a scheduled flight from Kunming, capital of 
Hunnan Province. 
</P>
<P>
But China's national airline, CAAC, schedules only seven flights a week on 
48-seat prop jets to the area, and tour groups snap up most of those well in 
advance, causing the regular flights to be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Individual travelers may find themselves stranded in Kunming with tickets that 
are no good because the flight has been canceled, or they face the prospect of 
getting to Xishuangbanna and not being able to return to Kunming. Return trips 
cannot be booked in advance on domestic flights in China. 
</P>
<P>
(Don't expect much help from Chinese officials in getting to this area. China 
has long been suspicious of its minority groups, and many Chinese ask openly 
why anyone would want to visit a minority area. Only after the Communists took 
power in 1949 was the symbol for "dog," until then included in the written 
characters for ethnic names, abolished.) 
</P>
<P>
This uncertainty makes less intrepid travelers nervous, but for tourists 
persistent or lucky enough to wade through the hassles and red tape that are 
China, the rewards are great. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only for Adventurous 
</P>
<P>
The flight from Kunming is just under one hour over the beautiful reddish-brown 
Ailao and Wuliang mountains, which surround sapphire blue lakes and small 
settlements. Narrow dirt roads, which from the air look like thin copper 
ribbon, wind around and up the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The plane touches down in Simao, a warm and sunny but otherwise uninspiring 
town. This is where you begin the hair-raising 3 1/2-hour bus journey to 
Yunjinghong -- sometimes referred to as Jinghong, the region's capital. The 
road has been paved in the last couple of years, but it is narrow and runs 
along the edge of sheer cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the overwhelming grayness of many northern Chinese cities, 
Yunjinghong is a splash of color. Dai women, wearing ankle-length pink, yellow 
or red form-fitting skirts and thin cotton blouses, stroll together down 
uncrowded streets. 
</P>
<P>
Well-made wooden Dai homes, which have thatched roofs and are built on stilts 
about six feet off the ground, dot the landscape. Banana and papaya trees are 
heavy with fruit, even in midwinter. 
</P>
<P>
Winter is the best time to visit, especially after a trip to sub-zero Beijing 
or Harbin, home of China's ice festival. March to October is monsoon season 
when the air is thick with mosquitoes. In winter the air is dry but warm, about 
84 degrees in mid-afternoon, with only slightly cooler temperatures at night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
Most tour groups stay at the Banna Guest House in Yunsjinghong. The rooms are 
drab and Spartan but clean, with showers that alternately scald and freeze you. 
Mosquito nets are provided. The rates are good, 28 yuan (about $8 U.S.) a night 
for a double, and the food in the restaurant is adequate if not inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Foreign Affairs Office of Yunnan Province was adamant that 
the Banna Guest House "is the only hotel now open to foreigners," but an 
adventuresome American couple traveling on their own said there are at least 
two alternatives in the city. 
</P>
<P>
One is the Dai Minority Guesthouse just outside downtown, where three or four 
guests at a time are allowed to stay in a thatched-roof Dai house and eat 
traditional Dai food, which Dai cooks will proudly say combines salty, sweet, 
sour and bitter tastes. 
</P>
<P>
This combination is quite good, and there are ample opportunities to sample Dai 
cuisine even if you don't stay there. Rates are 2.5 yuan per bed (about 70 
cents), with shared toilet and no showers. Only plywood partitions separate the 
beds, so don't expect much in the way of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
The other alternative is a small hotel on the grounds of the Tropical Cash Crop 
Institute of Yunnan Province, a short bicycle ride from the center of town. No 
rates were available, as most who stay there do as guests of the government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patience Pays Off 
</P>
<P>
While foreigners traveling unaccompanied by Chinese are likely to be turned 
away from either of these places by suspicious hotel clerks, those with 
persistence, and especially those who can speak a bit of Chinese, might be able 
to talk their way in. 
</P>
<P>
China has many strict-sounding rules about where foreigners are allowed and not 
allowed to go, but many of them are made to be broken by visitors with lots of 
patience and good humor. The China International Travel Service has an office 
directly across from the Banna Guest House, and someone is usually there during 
the day to help with accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
Yunjinghong's downtown area is plain, with the usual drugstores peddling deer 
antlers and other traditional medical remedies, as well as a few open-air 
bookstores. The best place to people-watch and absorb the flavor of this mix of 
cultures is the free market, held several times a week a few blocks from the 
Banna Guest House. 
</P>
<P>
The locals bring freshly slaughtered sheep and seemingly every other 
conceivable animal, as well as fruits and vegetables and a few handicrafts, 
such as woven handbags, to trade. 
</P>
<P>
Each ethnic group is recognizable by the costumes the women wear every day. 
Most men have adopted the loose dark green or blue jacket and pants of Han 
Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
(A note of advice: Visit the market in the morning when most business is 
conducted. By afternon the smell of the unrefrigerated meat can be 
overwhelming.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Cuisine 
</P>
<P>
You can sample Dai cuisine at the Dai Nationality restaurant a short walk from 
the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner, eaten in a traditional building with low tables and short bamboo 
chairs, typically consists of pork and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves, red 
rice that you grab with your hands and work into a ball before eating, fried 
leaves and other odd-sounding specialties, all a welcome change from typical 
Chinese cooking. Dessert is a sticky but tasty rice and sugar paste wrapped in 
a banana leaf. 
</P>
<P>
Small Dai settlements are a short bicycle ride from the guest house, which 
rents bikes for 1 yuan (about 27 cents) an hour. But to get an even better idea 
how the Dai people live, a boat ride down the Lancang River (better known to 
Westerners as the Mekong, around which much of everyday life revolves) is a 
must. 
</P>
<P>
The boat ride is like a step back in time, with boys frolicking in the water 
and women washing their waist-length hair while young and old alike pan for 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
The official accompanying our group told us that it is "not convenient" (read: 
not allowed) for tourists to travel down the river, and that the village is 
open only to foreigners working in China or scientists with a specific reason 
to be there. But again, persistence and a mild manner, combined with as much 
Chinese as you can muster, are all you really need to eventually win a seat on 
one of the boats. 
</P>
<P>
The best-known holiday in Xishuangbanna is the Water-Splashing Festival, April 
13-15. To mark the new year the Dai people race boats on the Mekong and shoot 
fireworks, and the young Dai women splash each other with water to dispel the 
diseases and misfortunes of the past year and usher in the new amid hopes for 
good health, abundant crops and fine cattle. 
</P>
<P>
Hints: Bring slide film from home. Slide film is available only in the largest 
Chinese cities and is sometimes out of stock even there. Bring binoculars for 
the trip down the river to get a better view of life along the banks. Bring 
Dramamine or a similar medication for motion sickness. Roads here are winding 
and steep, and often unpaved. Avoid overeating; food in Xishuangbanna tends to 
be very rich. 
</P>
<P>
If you are traveling on your own and have a specific scientific, educational or 
job-related reason to tour Xishuangbanna, come with a letter of introduction. 
This works wonders with nervous Chinese officials, who may then consider you an 
official guest worthy of the best treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Finding out anything about this area, such as customs, is difficult both 
because of the language gap and because relatively little has been written 
about this area of China. The only travel guide I've found with any information 
about Xishuangbanna is "China: A Travel Survival Kit" (Lonely Planet: $17.95).

SAM HALL KAPLAN: PRIZES, PRAISES WITH SLIGHT DAMN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam Hall Kaplan

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the more interesting aspects of the coveted Progressive Architecture 
(PA) magazine awards program is the snippets of dialogue between the jurors in 
the varied categories of architectural design, urban design and planning, and 
applied research. 
</P>
<P>
Often revealed in the jurors' general comments about the body of entries and 
specific comments about the winning projects is the tone and, sometimes, the 
substance of the continual debates in architecture and design concerning style, 
context and content. 
</P>
<P>
From a public point of view I found the increase of awards in the urban design 
and planning category for projects in Southern California most significant, and 
I devoted last week's column to the subject. 
</P>
<P>
But from a professional point of view, I felt the comments by the jurors 
concerning the submissions in the architectural design category were actually 
more reflective of the primary and current concerns of most practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt a reason is that focusing as it does on single projects the 
architectural design category by far attracts the most entries, this year 649 
out of a total of 805 submitted to the magazine. Also, many of the projects are 
the type architects tend to be involved with, in particular the single-family 
house, a perennial, popular winner. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor is that the jurors for the category were a particularly diverse 
lot representing diverse practices: architects Anthony Ames of Atlanta, Terry 
Farrell of London, Adrian Smith, of the Chicago office of the firm of Skidmore, 
Owings &amp; Merrill, and Bernard Tschumi, dean of the Graduate School of 
Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning style, Tschumi, a leader of sorts of the studied, self-absorbed 
Deconstructivist movement, observed that the submissions displayed a 
"satisfying" new emphasis on technological development. "After a few years of 
intense stylistic preoccupations in the architecture profession, suddenly there 
is a return to drawing one's language from the nature of materials and 
structural forces." 
</P>
<P>
It was a nice thought, but there was disagreement whether this was reflected in 
the submissions. While Ames felt some indeed were honest expressions of 
technology, Smith, whose firm built its reputation on a no-nonsense 
functionalism, declared others were "pure facade styling, like my necktie." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell, who is known for his forthright high-tech projects, called these 
efforts "slick tech" and added while some were graphically exciting, most were 
inherently dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
"I do accept that there is a return to natural materials" he added, "but they 
are often like a dress, wrapped around a building. Not that I think that is 
bad, but I don't agree that that is a fundamentally honest and integral way of 
expressing technology and construction." (Amen.) 
</P>
<P>
The jurors also expressed concern over what they felt was the treatment of 
projects as isolated objects, devoid of context, and the poor level of 
multifamily housing submissions. (These are issues I have been lamenting for 
some time.) 
</P>
<P>
While recognizing "a problem with priorities in dealing with the current 
social, cultural and political situation," Tschumi said more of the 
profession's talents needed to focus on such projects. "Some of our best 
architects are doing housing in Berlin, but not here." 
</P>
<P>
Even when picking winners, the jurors appeared at odds with themselves and each 
other. In awarding a citation to the Santa Monica-based firm of Morphosis for a 
well-sited, I thought, ingeniously organized 8,000-square-foot house in 
Montecito, Tschumi declared, "this is my favorite overkill." He did quickly add 
that he was saying that "with a lot of sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
Ames observed that the plan of the building actually was "very simple," but 
that perhaps the drawings made it more complex than it is. Replied Tschumi: "I 
suspect the architects are caught between a contemporary way of thinking and 
fascination with the grand gesture." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, the award was an impressive 11th the firm headed by Thom Mayne and 
Michael Rotundi has garnered in the coveted, annual PA contest . 
</P>
<P>
Winning for the first time was local newcomer Ronald McCoy, who received a 
citation for his intricately crafted house finessed onto a 35 by 90 lot in 
Marina del Rey. Tschumi said he didn't like it as "a free-standing object," but 
it was "actually OK' as an urban row house. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like is the idea of the compact, simple tubular geometry, and the way 
it's being explored internally in a very dense way," added Farrell. "Like many 
a good urban house, it relies not upon its external envelope but upon how it 
handles the interior spaces, and in particular how it stacks them in ways that 
introduces complexity and inversion." 
</P>
<P>
There also was an obvious difference of opinion among the jurors for a study of 
design issues for shelters for battered women and their children that won a 
citation in the applied research category. The study was a collaboration of 
research and design teams at Tulane University and UCLA, directed in part by 
Ben Reufuerzo, an assistant professor of architecture at the Westwood campus. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Donald Prowler said it was not clear whether the study was done for lay 
people or professionals. "If it was for the profession, some of their patterns 
were naive or mundane, to a point," declared Prowler, a University of 
Pennsylvania academic. "And if it's for the lay person, the style of 
presentation was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But Polly Welch, a Boston-based public official, said the study provided 
information that is really needed. And Smith added that "if there is a purpose 
in research in architecture, this comes closer to helping an architect than 
anything I know of." He declared the research "extremely relevant," with Welch 
adding "provocative and timely." Perhaps that is what bothered the academic. 
</P>
<P>
Such debates among jurors provide wonderful grist for my mill. It was with this 
very much in mind that I recently served on design award juries of the Santa 
Clara and San Fernando valley chapters of the American Institute of Architects. 
Those experiences will be shared in the next column.

MAN OF TWO COUNTRIES; 
</P>
<P>
IRISH NATIVE COMPARES MARKETS HERE, ABROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARNETT SUSSMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Rohan has learned to look for the future in two different places. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Rohan Corp., Los Angeles, he develops commercial and 
industrial property in Southern California and also in his native Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
He says the most significant difference between the two markets is how far away 
each places its future. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians, he says, see the future as being just beyond the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish see the future as off in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
One result of this time view is that Irish commercial and office leases 
typically are for 25 to 30 years, with a review every five years. 
</P>
<P>
This compares to the typical Southern California five-year lease with one 
five-year option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Greater Flexibility' 
</P>
<P>
"While the shorter leases favored by Southern Californians can be seen as 
reflecting a lack of long-term planning," Rohan says, "it can also be seen as 
showing greater flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
An offshoot of this differing view of time, Rohan says, is Californians' desire 
for new architectural designs compared to the Irish preference for traditional 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as significant as the differing time views is the greater wealth of the 
U.S. economy -- especially the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
One result is that Southern California tenants get more amenities because they 
can afford to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, while Southern California business park developers commonly use 
15% to 20% landscaping, in Ireland, it's more typical to use only 5% 
landscaping." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weather Conditions 
</P>
<P>
The Irish climate also affects development. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't use tilt-up concrete construction in Ireland because we can't pour 
concrete in the rain. The Irish evening frosts can also damage the curing of 
the concrete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Ireland, Rohan's firm manufactures precast concrete portal frames. These are 
used to support the building's roof. External walls are clad with concrete 
block or brick or a combination of block and metal sheeting. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, to satisfy a pent-up demand for housing, Rohan built more 
than 3,000 prefabricated concrete bungalows in Ireland. He sold them for about 
$2,000 each, which included erecting them on the buyer's property. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Better Labor Relations 
</P>
<P>
Labor relations between contractors and unions in Southern California are 
better than they are in Ireland, Rohan says. 
</P>
<P>
In Ireland, contractors must deal with a greater number of labor unions on each 
job site than do Los Angeles contractors. Irish labor unions are also more 
suspicious of management's motives than here and strikes are more common. 
</P>
<P>
Financing is also different. The Irish do not have anything similar to our 
construction loans on specific projects but make loans based on a builder's 
reputation and balance sheet.

TIPS TO HOMEOWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Armand L. Fontaine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: We are preparing for a fairly extensive remodeling project on our 
home and have interviewed several contractors. We have narrowed the field to 
two. One is a very small contractor who works out of his house, and the other 
is a very large operation. Do you have any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Before you make a decision, you should call homeowners for whom these 
firms have done remodeling projects and find out if they were satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Small contractors usually will cost you less money because they normally have 
lower overheads. On the other hand, the large contractor usually has better 
relationships with his subcontractors and is able to schedule work in a more 
sophisticated manner. (However, this is not always the case.) 
</P>
<P>
Many of the larger construction firms have their own designers who will design 
a project for you. The smaller contractor will usually work from your 
architect's or designer's plans or subcontract that work. Very often, people 
with large, costly projects will hire a reputable architect who has expertise 
in the area of home-improvement design, while others will go to a design/build 
construction firm, which will furnish the entire project. These firms usually 
charge for the design work and architectural renderings if their firm is not 
hired to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important things that you can do prior to signing a contract is 
to inspect at least two or three of the contractors' recently completed 
projects and talk to the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
There are contractors that specialize in luxury housing only and will not 
accept jobs under $100,000. Other contractors only do budget home-improvement 
projects on a volume basis. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I understand there is a tinting film applied to windows that also acts as a 
security film on broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
A: ArmorCoat security films act both as sun-resistant products and add 
security. The product, being much thicker than ordinary tinting film, is more 
than just a sun screen, offering an affordable source of security. 
</P>
<P>
Although the glass can be broken, they tell me that it is nearly impossible to 
penetrate the glass. The product provides energy efficiency and is good 
protection for earthquake safety, since it will prevent shards of glass from 
flying through the air. 
</P>
<P>
This product is available through Designer Glass by SGO at 1721 W. Verdugo 
Ave., Burbank, Calif.

'MODEST' RISE IN INTEREST RATES FORECAST BY SURVEY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM FINDS 100 LENDERS EXPECT REAL ESTATE PRICES TO STAY HIGH AS FOREIGNERS, 
PENSION FUNDS COMPETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interest rates will rise "modestly" by the end of the year, competition between 
pension funds and foreign investors for prime projects will continue to keep 
real estate prices high and residential construction may slow as rising 
interest rates and high prices squeeze more buyers out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the trends cited in the annual survey of more than 100 
lending institutions, conducted by George Smith/Grubb &amp; Ellis Financial 
Services, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Fox of Citicorp Real Estate Inc., who most accurately predicted interest 
rates in last year's survey, said his 1989 rate projections will be most 
affected by the "Federal Reserve policy and whether or not (the Fed's) 
vigilance toward inflation might not throw us into a recession." 
</P>
<P>
The 10.13% Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 30-year mortgage rate as of the 
beginning of the year is projected by the survey to increase to 10.38% by the 
end of the year, while the bank prime rate is expected to decrease from 10.5% 
to 10.32% by the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Our survey participants continue to be concerned about the effects the budget 
deficit, trade deficit, inflation, recession, Federal Reserve policy and oil 
prices could have on real estate," according to Mark S. Ehrenreich, survey 
director.

DEVELOPER SUES MALIBU COUNCIL FOR ATTACK IN AD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the largest commercial developer in a community where the ruling political 
body is controlled by staunch no- and slow-growth advocates, Roy Crummer has 
been an easy target for the steady stream of slings and arrows fired by the 
Malibu Township Council. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, Crummer decided to fire back. 
</P>
<P>
After seeing his name published in a biting newspaper ad that ran in the Malibu 
Times and in the township council's newsletter, Crummer sued the council and 
three of its members for libel. Crummer is seeking more than $10 million in 
damages from the group, which he claims launched a scurrilous attack "without 
any regard for the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The suit underscored the decades-long political battle in Malibu over coastal 
development and brought to the forefront numerous critics of the township 
council, who have become increasingly dismayed over the group's tactics to win 
support in the community. 
</P>
<P>
The council, the largest civic group in Malibu, led an unsuccessful fight last 
month to stop Los Angeles County supervisors from placing a sewer in Malibu 
without a vote of the residents. It is responsible for launching the cityhood 
effort to wrest control over development from the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mixed View of Council 
</P>
<P>
Although many residents in Malibu applauded the group's efforts to limit 
haphazard growth in the area, several community leaders have been appalled by 
the council's methods, especially its reliance on strident rhetoric in its 
newsletter and flyers. 
</P>
<P>
The group further enraged long-time supporters recently when, after more than a 
year of study, a citizens committee that included Crummer and three members of 
the township council endorsed a medium-size sewer system for Malibu. However, 
almost immediately after the committee unanimously voted to recommend approval 
of the system to supervisors, the township council disassociated itself from 
the proposal and said that its representatives on the committee did not speak 
for the group. 
</P>
<P>
And although the township council sparked the cityhood movement, some members 
of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation attempted to distance themselves from 
the council because of its unpopularity in some circles. 
</P>
<P>
"The township council performs an effective function, and they have to be given 
credit for the many ad hoc movements they've led," said Peter Arnold, president 
of the Malibu Chamber of Commerce. "But their approach tends to be highly 
confrontational. They're rather hostile to those that don't agree with them and 
often they just overstate their case." 
</P>
<P>
Crummer's lawsuit was based on published statements by the council that ran 
shortly before county supervisors approved a $43-million sewer system for 
Malibu on Jan. 12. Last week, the township council filed a lawsuit to block the 
sewer plan, charging that homeowners have been saddled with unfair sewer fees 
while businesses and large landowners reap a financial windfall. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Jan. 12 meeting, the group took out an ad in one of Malibu's two 
weekly newspapers to try to raise money for its anti-sewer campaign. It used 
the space to blast Crummer, Pepperdine University and a lawyer for the Adamson 
Companies, another large landowner in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The ad labeled Crummer "Super Rich Roy" and charged that the developer unfairly 
used his "considerable financial and political clout" with supervisors to pass 
on the costs of the sewer system to homeowners. The ad was bordered by the word 
"shameful" 40 times. 
</P>
<P>
And in the township council's newsletter, the group charged that Crummer and 
others have given millions of dollars in political donations to supervisors to 
get approval for the sewer, which, they say, will lead to "the long-anticipated 
orgy of development." 
</P>
<P>
The developer said he has contributed less than $10,000 to Supervisor Deane 
Dana, whose district includes Malibu, in the last eight years and hasn't given 
any money to any of the other county supervisors. The township council devoted 
an earlier newsletter to Dana, referring to him as "Sewer King Dana." 
</P>
<P>
The group also took a shot at Crummer's newly constructed shopping mall in the 
Civic Center, suggesting that it is the beginning of massive development in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Crummer responded with his libel suit, alleging that he suffered humiliation, 
mental anguish and emotional distress because of the written comments. He 
charged that the group's statements allegations are "false and misleading" and 
"go beyond all bounds of decency such as to amount to outrageous behavior." The 
lawsuit also names council President Larry Wan, Treasurer Frank Basso and 
member Carl Randall. 
</P>
<P>
"When they lie about me, they'd better get their facts straight," Crummer said. 
"I'm fed up with their bullying tactics and tired of their personal attacks on 
people. I've taken plenty of shots from them before, but this time they went 
too far. I want them to stop telling lies about me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Action 
</P>
<P>
Wan defended the group's action and called the libel suit an attempt to 
distract attention from the township council's legal fight against the 
county-approved sewer plan. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our interpretation," Wan said. "Unfortunately, the courts today are too 
often used for lawsuits of this kind." 
</P>
<P>
Wan, Randall and other members of the township council declined to discuss the 
specific charges in the libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
However, several community leaders said the suit could be particularly damaging 
to the group's credibility in Malibu. The township council, which is similar to 
a residents group and has more than 1,000 members in the community of 20,000, 
is by far the most powerful and the richest political group in Malibu, raising 
nearly $100,000 to fight the sewer proposal. Yet several leading community 
figures have left the organization in recent years, expressing dissatisfaction 
with the group's views. 
</P>
<P>
"They've turned many intelligent people off by some of their irresponsible 
rhetoric," said Dr. Susan Reynolds, head of the Malibu Emergency Room and vice 
president of the Chamber of Commerce. "Certain things they represent are good 
for the community, but the rhetoric and negativism that they engage in need a 
lot of improvement, and somebody needs to take them to task." 
</P>
<P>
Leon Cooper, a former president of the township council and one of its most 
outspoken members, did not deny that the group is often contentious, but said 
that its behavior is justified by the relentless attempts by the county and 
some developers to destroy some of the natural beauty of the beachfront 
community. He said the group should be credited for leading the fight to block 
a county proposal to build a recreational vehicle park at Zuma Beach and 
praised for its efforts to create Malibu Lagoon State Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The Malibu Township Council has a long and illustrious history of defending 
issues that will benefit the community," he said. "We've been able to prevent 
some disastrous things from happening. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty contentious myself, and people (in the group) get excited about 
things that we think are grossly unfair. Some of the things that go on here 
make me angry, and I vent my spleen. But just because some of us have a short 
fuse doesn't mean that the cause is unjust." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stirred Emotion 
</P>
<P>
The suit has stirred much emotion in the community. Ronald Carpol, Crummer's 
attorney, said he has received several "hate calls" from township council 
supporters. However, he said, most of the callers praise Crummer for taking on 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
Crummer said he considered ignoring the group's written remarks but decided 
that he was fed up with the council's view "that they can say whatever they 
want about anybody they want." 
</P>
<P>
"These attacks are so personal and petty that it reminds me of the type of name 
calling you would see in grammar school," he said. "There's nothing wrong with 
criticism and with disagreements among people, but there are limits. If you 
attack people or issues, you should do it in a responsible way."

SEE JACK RUN; 
</P>
<P>
FRIENDS, FOES -- AND HIS WIFE -- WONDER WHAT TURNED MCGRATH FROM CONSULTANT TO 
CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack McGrath, write-in candidate for the City Council, is a restless man. 
</P>
<P>
He is forever pacing, puffing cigarettes and fidgeting with the frames on his 
wire-rimmed glasses as he plots political strategy for his campaign against his 
former boss and pal, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Write-in candidates rarely garner more than a fraction of the vote, but McGrath 
has some big ideas. First he dropped his last name and recast himself as 
"Jack." Why burden people with two names when one will do? 
</P>
<P>
Then he took to the streets with the message that people power is back. "I love 
people in the streets," he proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
He found one such street person, a wayward Catholic priest living in a park who 
hit him up for a few bucks, and anointed him as his North Hollywood 
coordinator. McGrath may not have a prayer, but at least he has a priest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grocery Store Bag 
</P>
<P>
And he set out in search of a campaign theme and found it on the side of a 
grocery store bag. "The Ralphs bags say change is for the better," McGrath 
said. "I bought 200 of them. The power of that message is very strong." 
</P>
<P>
What happens next is anyone's guess. But the "Jack for City Council" campaign 
is sure to be anything but dull since the candidate is McGrath, a veteran 
campaign consultant who possesses an Irish ward heeler's flair for political 
showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
The paunchy but boyishly handsome McGrath has already delivered a case of 
Russian vodka and some pine saplings to the Bel-Air home of Ronald and Nancy 
Reagan, two of the 5th District's newest arrivals. McGrath also invited the 
former First Couple to call if they have any problems, such as potholes. 
</P>
<P>
More recently he stood outside Yaroslavsky's City Hall office and brazenly 
accused the councilman of financial shenanigans. McGrath holds Yaroslavsky 
responsible for traffic congestion, intense commercial growth, the parking 
shortage and just about everything else that's wrong with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky has deftly deflected the charges leveled by his former council 
chief deputy so far, but professes to be genuinely mystified by McGrath's 
sudden emergence as a political foe. "I don't have much to say about it because 
I have no idea why he's running," Yaroslavsky said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Others who are close to both men also question what's motivating McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disastrous move," said one confidant who asked to remain anonymous. 
"There's no rational basis for what Jack is doing here." 
</P>
<P>
"People are worried about him," said another who also spoke anonymously. "A lot 
of his friends don't want to have anything to do with him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, 43, who decided to run as a write-in candidate after he failed to 
collect the 500 signatures needed to formally qualify for the ballot, says he's 
aware of his friends' concerns. But in dismissing them he is fond of invoking 
the name of one of his heroes, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reaching for the promised land," McGrath said recently. "And I'm not 
afraid to die politically. If I die politically, my life still goes on. But if 
I don't die, that means that I get to serve my constituency." 
</P>
<P>
People who have worked with him over the years say such hyperbole is typical of 
McGrath, who was once described as the merry prankster of municipal politics. 
The North Hollywood resident is credited with adding spark to the campaigns of 
clients such as Yaroslavsky and state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys) in the 
1970s. And last November he helped mount a highly successful reelection bid on 
behalf of Santa Monica City Councilman Herb Katz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right From Wrong 
</P>
<P>
But he also has a reputation for recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, while serving as campaign manager for city attorney candidate Bob 
Ronka, McGrath was involved in the making of a television commercial linking 
Ronka's opponent, Ira Reiner, to convicted murderer Charles Manson. McGrath 
resigned under pressure after the spot was roundly denounced. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath also got into hot water with Yaroslavsky around that time for using the 
councilman's name to promote a real estate venture. People who have worked with 
McGrath say he often has a hard time distinguishing right from wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't help Jack, he will get into trouble," said one political 
consultant who asked not to be named. "He has a tendency to step into it." 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been one of the most creative people around," said another. "He 
just pops with ideas. But he often loses his judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Many see McGrath's decision to run as a perfect illustration of that point. At 
the outset of the campaign season, when Yaroslavsky was expecting to run for 
mayor and others started lining up to succeed him, McGrath signed on as an aide 
to Steve Saltzman, a veteran political activist from Century City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Surprise 
</P>
<P>
It was only after Yaroslavsky changed his mind and filed for reelection that 
McGrath suddenly emerged as a candidate himself. "One night we had dinner with 
a possible contributor," Saltzman said. "On the following morning, unbeknownst 
to me, Jack filed to run for the seat. . . . It seemed ludicrous. He had no 
funds, no campaign management and no support." 
</P>
<P>
The move also came as a surprise to Yaroslavsky, since McGrath had just 
attended his yearly Christmas party and given $500 to his mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He was patting me on the back at my party," Yaroslavsky said. "He had his arm 
around me. . . . It was very friendly and chatty. I guess in the first week of 
January he decided that my performance had diminished considerably." 
</P>
<P>
The story soon made the rounds that McGrath had also neglected to reveal his 
plans to his wife, Maria. McGrath concedes that she was angry about the 
decision and that even now she "is not emotionally committed to this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Why Not Me?' 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, McGrath defends the move. "Sometimes you have to 
make your own decisions," he said. "We're not fighting over it now, though we 
did initially. She said, 'Why you?' And I said, 'Why not me?' " 
</P>
<P>
As McGrath explains it, he first became disenchanted with Yaroslavsky while 
working for Saltzman. Everywhere he went, he said, people complained about 
development, traffic tie-ups and other problems. "I thought, 'Jeez, what 
happened?,' " he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath kept his reservations about his old friend to himself. But when 
Yaroslavsky filed for reelection in early January, causing speculation that 
Saltzman would drop out, McGrath said he had to act. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent two days considering my options," he said. "I drove around past places 
where things had happened in my life. Then I decided to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing to Gain 
</P>
<P>
Many wish he hadn't. People who travel in the same political circles as McGrath 
and Yaroslavsky say McGrath has nothing to gain and everything to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it is not a productive act on his part, but I don't know how to talk to 
him about it," said Jackie Brainard, a friend of both men. "I guess he really 
believes he can do a better job, and that's why he's running." 
</P>
<P>
Added Richard Lichtenstein of Marathon Communications, who hired McGrath to 
help out with Santa Monica City Councilman Katz's reelection campaign: "I told 
Jack that everybody's entitled to run. But I also reminded him to campaign in a 
manner that's not going to do him irreparable harm." 
</P>
<P>
As he sat inside his tidy ranch style house recently, smoking cigarettes, 
drinking coffee and thumbing through a scrapbook that contains several pictures 
of himself and Yaroslavsky, McGrath questioned what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Hall Experience 
</P>
<P>
After all, he's just one of three people challenging Yaroslavsky. The others 
are Westwood activist Laura M. Lake and traffic consultant Ryan Snyder. And 
he's the only challenger who has City Hall experience. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said San Fernando Valley voters, who account for about a third of the 
5th District, have been waiting for one of their own to assume power. In one of 
his strongest campaign pitches, McGrath has pledged to protect his neighbors 
from the kind of growth that has plagued the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"As councilman, I would only approve good development," McGrath said. "And when 
I say good, I mean damn good. If not, let em build it in Cudahy." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, the son of professional dance teachers who worked at the Arthur Murray 
studios, grew up in the valley and has lived there most of his life. In 
addition to serving as Yaroslavsky's campaign manager and deputy, he has been a 
lobbyist, a bus shelter executive and an Assembly candidate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Estate Broker 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he was employed as a commercial real estate broker. McGrath said 
he not concerned about his real estate dealings costing him credibility within 
the slow growth community. "All we do is the buildings that Zev has already 
OKd," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
What people on both sides of Mulholland Drive are most interested in is finding 
someone who understands and shares their frustrations, he said, adding that 
solving problems is easy once you understand how the bureaucracy works. 
</P>
<P>
On a quick ride through his neighborhood, McGrath points to a health club that 
suffers from a parking shortage and a weeded area that people could be using as 
a dog run, then claims he could instantaneously rectify both problems once he 
got inside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
He expounds on that theme in a cable television commercial that highlights 
problems plaguing the district. The commercial ends, inexplicably, with a 
lingering shot of McGrath talking to a man bundled up like an Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credibility Problems 
</P>
<P>
McGrath knows that he suffers some credibility problems because of his past 
political mistakes and his recent failure to qualify for the ballot. But he 
also revels in the role of underdog and political provocateur. 
</P>
<P>
People who have known him for a long time say he is only happy when he's in the 
thick of things. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm a long shot," McGrath said. "But my whole life has been a long 
shot. People said I was crazy in 1975 when I first supported Zev for the City 
Council, and they're saying I'm crazy now. But these people are going to be 
surprised. They're going to see the best street operation ever run."

BELLFLOWER ANTI-REDEVELOPMENT PETITION DRIVE FALLS SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer

BELLFLOWER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens' group has failed to garner enough voter support to challenge the 
recent creation of a Community Redevelopment Agency in this mostly residential 
town. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of the small group vowed to continue their fight against the agency 
through the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Citizens Against Another Redevelopment Plan, which unsuccessfully 
fought three pro-redevelopment initiatives approved by voters in November, said 
last week that they were short of the required signatures to either force the 
council to repeal the month-old ordinance that created the agency or call a 
special election in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The group launched a petition drive last month, the day after the City Council 
exercised its newly acquired power to create an agency. The group needed to 
gather 2,800 signatures -- 10% of Bellflower's registered voters -- by the end 
of last week. 
</P>
<P>
The organization collected only 2,200 signatures through its mail-in petition 
drive, and did not bother to deliver them to City Hall, group officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really thought the signatures were out there," group treasurer Ruth Gilson 
said. "We thought for sure enough would come back (through the mail)." 
</P>
<P>
Organization members mailed out blank petition forms to most households in 
Bellflower, asking registered voters to sign the one-page document, gather five 
more signatures and return the form by mail to the Gilson home. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait until the (redevelopment) plan is set up," said former Mayor James 
Earl Christo, a Bellflower Boulevard businessman and a group member who was 
defeated in his 1986 City Council reelection bid. "Then we'll take an active 
role in taking it to the voters again." 
</P>
<P>
Although a proposed area has been earmarked for future redevelopment projects, 
city officials said that a comprehensive redevelopment plan will not be 
completed for six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they were relieved that the signature-gathering effort 
failed. They estimated that a special election would have cost the city between 
$20,000 and $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't understand that these elections cost a lot of money," said Mayor 
Kenneth J. Cleveland, who supported the creation of a redevelopment agency in 
this city of 61,000 residents. "I hope (the long-running controversy over the 
creation of an agency) is finally over." 
</P>
<P>
The often bitter dispute over whether a redevelopment agency would benefit or 
hurt the city began in the early 1980s when the council first proposed a 
sweeping redevelopment plan that put almost one-third of the city in a 
redevelopment area. The current proposed plan earmarks only 605 acres of the 
6-square-mile city as a redevelopment zone. 
</P>
<P>
Christo was swept into city office in 1982 on an anti-redevelopment platform. 
The next year, he led a petition drive to force a special election. Voters in 
that election, apparently fearing their homes would be threatened by an 
agency's land-taking power, overwhelmingly voted to prohibit the council from 
creating a redevelopment agency without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
But voters rescinded that restriction in November by passing three 
pro-redevelopment initiatives by narrow margins. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives, which restored the council's power to create an agency without 
voter approval, also banned condemnation of residential property and outlined a 
proposed redevelopment area that includes the commercial and industrial 
corridors along Artesia, Bellflower and Lakewood boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens Against Another Redevelopment Plan officials attributed the failure of 
their petition drive to the lack of signature-collecting manpower and the 
possibility that many residents may have considered the petition form as "junk 
mail" and thrown it away without studying it. 
</P>
<P>
"The mail-out is never as effective as going out to markets and the street to 
collect signatures," Christo said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Accept It 
</P>
<P>
But Cleveland said that the drive failed because residents have now come to 
accept that Bellflower needs redevelopment to stay competitive with other 
cities for sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment agencies sponsor renewal projects in aging sections of cities by 
offering developers incentives, such as low-cost land, to build commercial and 
industrial projects. 
</P>
<P>
The city benefits from increased sales tax and property tax revenue generated 
by the renewal projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of people who were against it (redevelopment)," Cleveland said. 
"Now they come up to me and ask, 'When are you going to get moving on this?' " 
</P>
<P>
"We were waiting for this thing (the petition drive) to pass," Cleveland said. 
"Now I expect we will be moving on it in an orderly fashion and get a project 
under way as soon as possible."

A panel appointed seven months ago to investigate Police Chief Don Tutich has 
found no merit to charges by rank-and-file police officers that the chief was 
an ineffective department head and had altered the report on an accident 
involving a member of his family. 
</P>
<P>
In a terse statement released last week, the city announced that "after 
considering all of the testimony," the three-man Police Department Review 
Committee "concludes that it finds no basis for the charges." 
</P>
<P>
The committee, consisting of City Councilman Ted Anderson, City Atty. Kenneth 
Brown and City Administrator Robert Clute, was appointed by the City Council 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's statement, upon which committee members would not elaborate, 
apparently resolves a longstanding political issue that at one time pitted two 
council factions against each other. The charges indirectly forced the 
resignation last May of a city attorney who had commenced his own investigation 
of Tutich. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No-Confidence Vote 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, the 30-member Police Officers Assn. voted "no confidence" in 
Tutich, alleging that the chief had used "restrictive and antiquated" police 
procedures, resulting in the loss of federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
The association also charged that Tutich had failed to recruit Asian police 
officers, though the city's population is about one-third Asian, and that he 
had sought to alter the report on an accident in which his father-in-law was 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
Tutich, who has been police chief for 13 years, responded heatedly to the 
charges. He said the San Gabriel Police Department had been a model department 
that applied for federal block grants and contributed significantly to reducing 
crime in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The troops have done an outstanding job," Tutich said at the time. "That's one 
of the ironies of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
The committee discussed its findings Tuesday in a closed session of the City 
Council, permitted under state law because the issue under discussion was a 
personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unanimous Acceptance 
</P>
<P>
Council members would not discuss the committee's findings or the nature of 
their discussion, except to say that the committee's report was unanimously 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm satisfied," said Vice Mayor Frank Blaszcak. "It wasn't a matter to 
be voted on, but you can safely say that there was unanimity on the council as 
a matter of acceptance (of the findings)." 
</P>
<P>
Tutich, who was attending a police chiefs' conference in Costa Mesa, could not 
be reached for comment. Officer Ray Schneiders, president of the Police 
Officers Assn., was on vacation last week. Other members referred all inquiries 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
For a few weeks last spring, the allegations against Tutich became a hot 
political issue as incumbents on the council accused challengers in the 
municipal election of orchestrating the charges. The challengers, running on a 
slow-growth slate, denied that they were involved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Previous Investigation 
</P>
<P>
After three slow-growth challengers ousted three incumbents in the April 
election, the council appointed Orange County lawyer R. Zaiden Corrado as city 
attorney. Corrado began an investigation of the Police Department but resigned 
less than a month later, charging that Mayor John Tapp was impeding the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Tapp denied that he had done anything improper, explaining that Corrado's 
investigation was not timely. Corrado had "jumped the gun," said Councilman 
James Castaneda. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's behind us," Tapp said. "Too bad it took a year to come to 
conclusion. I hope the community can go forward and work on other issues now." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Sabino Cici said he heartily approved of the exoneration of Tutich. 
"I just think we should have gone a step further and apologized to the chief 
for taking so long," Cici said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Capt. David Lawton, the department's No. 2 man, who had issued a 
statement in support of Tutich last year, said the committee's findings were no 
surprise. "I never felt there was any substance to the allegations to begin 
with," he said.

MAY CO. INTENDS TO JOIN A REBUILT, ENCLOSED STONEWOOD MALL 
</P>

<P>
Stonewood Shopping Center, a 31-year-old open-air mall, is scheduled for a face 
lift that may include a 150,000-square-foot May Co. store. 
</P>
<P>
May Co. has submitted a letter of intent to Hughes Investments, owner of the 
center, asking permission to build a two-level department store at the mall, 
which is to be enclosed and expanded by November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The May Co. proposal must be approved by the three other major stores at 
Stonewood -- J. C. Penney, Mervyn's and the Broadway -- before a contract is 
signed. Spokesmen for all three said last week that they would welcome the 
addition. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the new store and for expansion must also pass muster with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The May Co. is just one of 40 to 50 new stores that will be added to Stonewood 
by the expansion, which is projected to cost up to $40 million. The mall now 
has 100 stores. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Investments officials say that expanding and enclosing Stonewood will 
have several lasting beneficial effects for Downey. 
</P>
<P>
"It re-establishes Downey as a major force of trade," said Patrick Flynn, 
Hughes' director of marketing. "It provides a sales tax base for the city and 
provides 1,500 part-time and full-time jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Stonewood now employs 750 people. 
</P>
<P>
Downey has not projected the amount of revenue the redeveloped mall will 
generate, but the project does mean a definite increase in sales taxes, said 
Scot Yotsuya, assistant to the city manager. The mall now brings Downey about 
$1 million annually in sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes bought the aging shopping center at Downey Avenue and Firestone 
Boulevard in late 1986. The company decided to enclose and enlarge the mall so 
it would look modern and attract more customers. 
</P>
<P>
A report to the City Council last year said Stonewood draws customers within a 
15-minute driving radius, whereas other regional malls get shoppers from a 
driving radius of 25 to 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of upgrading the mall was supported in April by an independent 
planning and development consulting firm, Stanley R. Hoffman Associates, in a 
report to the City Council on redeveloping the city's central hub. The report 
also recommended that the council consider reorganizing present businesses on 
Firestone Boulevard near the mall to complement Stonewood. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the report were ways that 3.2 miles of Firestone Boulevard -- 
considered the city's commercial center -- can draw more customers from 
throughout the region by moving several auto dealerships scattered along the 
street to the eastern and western ends of the main thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Yotsuya said the consulting firm's report -- which cost $27,000 -- will be used 
only as a "reference tool" and that the council has no plans now to implement 
any of its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants and shoppers recently had generally favorable comments about the 
plans for Stonewood. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kelley, manager of three clothing stores at Stonewood (Miller's West, 
Miller's Store for Men and Kelley Greene's), said the proposed addition of May 
Co. and the expansion of the mall will increase his already-lucrative business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Benefits Downey as a Whole' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited about it. . . . It benefits Downey as a whole, not just my 
business. Hopefully, the Downey corridor will follow suit," said Kelley, who 
has worked at Stonewood for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Jarman Shoe Store Manager Kevin Moore was told that Stonewood was "a potential 
gold mine" by his supervisors, who assigned him there more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the gold mine never panned out because another Jarman store, in Los 
Cerritos Center less than 10 miles from Stonewood, gets more customers. 
</P>
<P>
The recent closing of the Cerritos store for remodeling has given Moore a 
preview of what he thinks sales will be like once the Stonewood expansion is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the Cerritos (store) is closed for remodeling, many of the customers 
are driving to Stonewood saying, 'I didn't know the mall was here . . . and we 
live here in Downey,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Night Shopper Increase Seen 
</P>
<P>
Janet Green, a new manager of Crafts Show Case, sees the May Co. addition as a 
big improvement that will increase the number of people who shop at night. 
</P>
<P>
Many customers expressed fear about night shopping after a young woman's body 
was found in a vehicle in the mall parking lot in December, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
It was later determined that the woman was murdered elsewhere and her body 
brought to Stonewood. 
</P>
<P>
Stonewood is patroled by eight licensed officers. Larry Norton, the mall's 
general manager, said more officers will be hired because of the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers seemed to have mixed feelings about the pending changes at Stonewood. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't shop at May Co., to tell you the truth," Judy McGregory of Downey 
said. "I just don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Estella Tiscareno of Bell Gardens had a completely different opinion: "I think 
it will be great to have another May Co. store. The more stores (here) the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Friends of the Mall 
</P>
<P>
Susan Mendez of Pico Rivera saw the enclosure of Stonewood almost as the demise 
of an old friend: "Well, I like the open mall better. There are not many of 
them around any more. . . . (It's) not that big of a mall that you can't get 
around from one end to another."

BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL HONORS NOTED ALUMNI WITH HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like baseball and rock and roll, Beverly Hills High School has its own Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Each year since 1984, the school has selected a group of graduates who have 
gone on to fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Past recipients have included Los Angeles Philharmonic Music Director Andre 
Previn (Class of '46) and actress Betty White (Class of '39). 
</P>
<P>
But "we are not just talking about celebrities," said John Suckling, president 
of the school's Alumni Assn., which makes the selections. "I would prefer to 
think of them as people who are noted in their chosen professions or careers. 
They might be in any profession -- banking, medicine or acting." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, this year's inductees are brothers George and Hoyt Pardee, home building 
executives, and Charles Older, a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge. They 
join 12 other Beverly Hills High School graduates who have been honored. 
</P>
<P>
The winners are selected from a group of people who are nominated and 
interviewed by individual members of the Alumni Assn. board of directors. The 
entire board votes on the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
Winners are announced in the association's annual magazine, mailed to former 
graduates throughout the country. This year, the association plans to place 
plaques honoring each Hall of Fame member on a wall at the school. The display, 
said Principal Sol Levine, "will give students a sense of the history and 
achievements of the institution they are a part of." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Philanthropic Work 
</P>
<P>
"The Hall of Fame was created because we know these names are important," 
Suckling said. "It's an interest-getter, but it is also intendeded to be a true 
honor. We don't give it to anyone to whom it would not be important. They have 
to want it." 
</P>
<P>
The Pardees founded the Pardee Construction Co. in 1946. The company merged 
with Weyerhaeuser Co. of Washington state and became one of the largest 
residential construction firms in Southern California. George (Class of '38) 
and Hoyt Pardee ('36) have been recognized for their philanthropic work. 
</P>
<P>
Older (Class of '35) was a decorated fighter pilot during World War II. He was 
appointed judge for the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1967. He has won 
several California State Bar awards. 
</P>
<P>
The two Pardees could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Older, reached by telephone, said: "I think it's great. I feel honored to have 
been chosen. There are many others who are just as deserving." 
</P>
<P>
Other Hall of Fame members are Sherman Mellinkoff ('37), dean emeritus of UCLA 
School of Medicine; Robert Moore ('38), Disney animator; Robert Hartmann ('34), 
White House aide and journalist; Walter Stoessel Jr. ('37), former ambassador 
to West Germany; Robert Badham ('47), former congressman from California; Maria 
Tallchief ('42), prima ballerina; Dr. Jerome Kay ('39), thoracic and 
cardiovascular surgeon, and Louise Brough ('40), former Wimbledon and national 
tennis champion. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, founding President Justin McCarthy ('41) was honored along with oil 
executive William Pagen ('38) and White, who stars in the hit NBC-TV series 
"The Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
Suckling said those in the Hall of Fame are only a few of the notable graduates 
from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Famous Parents 
</P>
<P>
"There are few public high schools in the country with more famous students," 
he said. "Beverly Hills graduates turn up all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Suckling displayed a newspaper article that appeared last year 
about Col. Robert B. Thieme Jr., a graduate in the Class of '36. Thieme, a 
Texas-based fundamentalist preacher noted for his frequent attacks against 
unions, feminists and homosexuals, made news when it was reported that Vice 
President Dan Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, used to listen to tape recordings 
of his speeches. 
</P>
<P>
Other famous former graduates who have not made the list include Donald L. 
Bren, a wealthy Orange County developer whose personal fortune was estimated at 
over $1 billion; Los Angeles Times Managing Editor George Cotliar, and actors 
Jackie Cooper, Rhonda Fleming, Richard Chamberlain and Richard Dreyfuss. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills High School also has a long list of graduates whose parents were 
celebrities, such as Desi Arnaz Jr., Alana Ladd and Jack Linkletter. 
</P>
<P>
Suckling, 58, a graduate of the Class of '48, said he falls in the category of 
one of the "youngest of the oldtimers who graduated from Beverly Hills High." 
</P>
<P>
Besides naming graduates to the Hall of Fame, the alumni group works to raise 
money for college scholarships for students. About $27,000 has been given to 
students since the organization was founded in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The association also has managed to track down 19,000 of the 25,000 students 
who have graduated from the school, which turns 61 years old this year, 
Suckling said. These efforts have helped various graduating classes set up 
reunions each year and has even assisted in the formation of alumni chapters in 
New York and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The association is planning a big reunion for the school's 65th anniversary in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
It's through such reunions, Suckling said, that he manages to keep in touch 
with the past. "These are special gatherings," he said. "I had an older brother 
who was killed in World War II, when I was 12. When I go to these reunions it 
is the only time I'm around people who knew my brother. It is a way for me to 
keep in touch."

IS THE ART MUSEUM TRULY INDEPENDENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your reporter (Tracy) Wilkinson wrote an article about the criminal arraignment 
of a Santa Monica developer, Abby Sher, in connection with events surrounding 
her Edgemar museum-restaurant complex on Main Street. (Times, Jan. 15.) On Jan. 
29, you printed a letter from the museum director, Thomas Rhoads. Rhoads' 
letter attempted to "correct some factual errors" in the Wilkinson article, 
regarding the relationship between this developer, Edgemar and the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoads went to some length to draw a distinction between Sher's business 
dealings and the operations of the museum, objecting to Wilkinson's use of the 
term "private museum," and commenting that "in fact, the museum is a separate 
entity from Edgemar." However, Rhoads neglected to inform the readers of the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
As late as Jan. 31, "Museum Director" Rhoads and "Founder/Vice President of 
SMMoA Board of Trustees" Sher shared the same business address (1333 Ocean 
Ave.), same mailbox slot, office space and staff (Janet Baetz). 
</P>
<P>
The "fact sheet" Edgemar handed out to interested parties gave the same phone 
number to contact for "information regarding Edgemar/Santa Monica Museum of 
Art." 
</P>
<P>
According to Sher at an open city meeting last spring, Rhoads is her employee 
under the terms of a personal-services employment contract. 
</P>
<P>
As an aside, various Edgemar press releases and news articles have referred to 
the museum's "board of directors." Rhoads mentioned "nine trustees" in his 
letter. It is unclear whether the museum has both directors and trustees, and 
whether both or either make policy or merely offer advice. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the information above begs the question of whether the museum is truly 
independent from the developer, as Rhoads contends, or does one actually 
control the other?

OPPOSED TO PROPOSAL FOR HOMELESS UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Taico Properties' proposal to donate its vacant structures at 701 
Ocean Ave. -- in the heart of one of Santa Monica's most beautiful 
neighborhoods -- as temporary housing for the homeless, City Councilman Herb 
Katz seriously mistakes "the bottom line" to read that "we are wallowing in 
damned bureaucracy" by delaying immediate implementation of the plan. (Times, 
Feb. 5) 
</P>
<P>
What we who live near 701 Ocean Ave. are wallowing in, Mr. Katz, is your own 
bureaucratic insensitivity to your constituency and your unconscionable 
disregard for maintaining the safety, peace and quality of life in our 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of public policy, the homeless problem is not effectively addressed 
by merely thinning it out, spreading it around. On the contrary, the impact of 
the homeless is increased if we permit the establishment of mini-Skid Rows 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
I know it's satisfying for you bleeding hearts in City Hall to sit around 
looking at the floor, looking at the ceiling, musing on what wonderful 
intellectually stimulating social programs you can come up with next to attract 
additional human catastrophe to our once-lovely city. You're in touch with the 
homeless, all right. Sensitive to their every need. But you're sadly out of 
touch with Santa Monica residents -- taxpayers, voters -- whose idea of an 
acceptable urban environment does not include living in an encampment of 
transients. 
</P>
<P>
We in Santa Monica have demonstrated a serious commitment to helping the 
homeless. We not only offer them breakfast, lunch and dinner, we provide them a 
choice of locations. When the weather is inclement, we dole out hotel vouchers. 
Given what the homeless contribute in return, they're not getting a bad deal. 
Objecting to them moving in as "neighbors" is not tantamount to ignoring them 
or not caring about them. We can care deeply about trauma victims, but that 
doesn't mean we should have to live in an emergency ward or that there should 
be a hospital on every residential block. 
</P>
<P>
I urge our city officials to dedicate their efforts to implementing programs 
for the disadvantaged that do not disadvantage the whole of our city. Does 
anybody remember the days when we could take our families to cook out in 
Palisades Park without being panhandled and getting lessons in public urination 
and bedroll airing? The days before our Santa Monica politicians decided that 
the answer to the homeless problem was to offer more and more free services and 
abandon enforcement of the Santa Monica Municipal Code?

A PROPOSED CHILDREN'S COURT FIT FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For children who must be removed from their parents' care because of abuse or 
neglect, proceedings in Los Angeles County Dependency Court can exacerbate the 
trauma of their tumultuous home life. 
</P>
<P>
The Dependency Court is housed in the Criminal Courts Building in downtown Los 
Angeles, a facility designed for hardened lawbreakers, not frightened children. 
Families waiting for their hearings often must stand in crowded, noisy 
corridors outside the courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The crush in the hallways has been bad enough to prompt the city fire marshal 
to cite the court for being "grossly overcrowded" on the 12th floor, where 
dependency hearings are held. Clerks, court reporters and counselors from the 
child advocate's office are housed in makeshift offices in unventilated storage 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
However, court officials hope that can change soon with the proposed 
construction of the Los Angeles County Children's Court in Monterey Park. When 
its doors open, perhaps early in 1992, the court will be unlike any other 
facility in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has ever built a building like this," said Frank Zolin, executive 
officer of the Los Angeles County court system. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that anyone has designed a children's court where the 
entire caseload would (involve) neglected and abused children (rather than 
delinquents). There's nothing even similar." 
</P>
<P>
The six-story, $45.1-million project goes before the Monterey Park City Council 
for approval this week. The county Board of Supervisors will consider giving 
final design and construction approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the project is approved by the city and the county, ground would 
be broken next year at the six-acre site on the western edge of Monterey Park, 
near the junction of the Long Beach and San Bernardino freeways. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast to the forbidding environs of the Criminal Courts Building, 
the Children's Court would be designed to be "child sensitive," Zolin said. The 
court building would include such amenities as diaper-changing rooms and 
secured play areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have scaled-down courtrooms that are less formal and less imposing in 
an effort to reduce the trauma on the children," Zolin said. "Obviously, all 
the areas that will serve the children, the waiting rooms, shelter care, will 
be designed with children in mind." 
</P>
<P>
The facility will also house all the various ancillary agencies that provide 
services to children. The county Department of Children's Services, the county 
counsel and the Sheriff's Department will all have office space in the 
building, as will private psychiatrists and psychologists and volunteers from 
the child advocate's office. 
</P>
<P>
Children whose cases are heard in the court will also benefit from its close 
proximity to Cal State Los Angeles, just across the San Bernardino Freeway. 
Zolin said the university and the court will be able to develop a closer 
relationship that will benefit both institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"People now working in Dependency Court will do in-service training at the 
university -- people in the county counsel, sheriff's deputies and counselors 
from the Department of Children's Services," Zolin said. "Also, it will be a 
learning opportunity for students from Cal State L.A. studying sociology and 
social case work." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Los Angeles President James S. Rosser said the court would provide an 
ideal setting for internships for students in the university's School of Health 
and Human Services. Attorneys and counselors from the court would also be 
welcome to serve as adjunct faculty at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Zolin added that Cal State Los Angeles is a leading university in studying the 
particular social problems manifested in many of the cases heard each day in 
Dependency Court. 
</P>
<P>
"Cal State L.A. is one of the up-and-coming universities in the U.S. dealing 
with urban problems," Zolin said. "I believe proximity to Cal State L.A. and 
this partnership is really going to enhance research into domestic violence and 
child neglect." 
</P>
<P>
Rosser said the relationship between the university and the court "fits in with 
the urban-focus commitment we have as part of our mission as a university. . . 
. I'm very pleased to see (the court project) coming to a positive fruition." 
</P>
<P>
The Dependency Court was originally moved to the Criminal Courts Building on a 
"temporary basis" in 1978. Since virtually its first day there, court officials 
complained that a building created for criminal proceedings was not the proper 
place to decide such a sensitive matter as whether a child should be removed 
from his or her family. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the classic stories is about when one of the . . . youngsters was 
walking in through the front door and saw the (Criminal Courts Building) sign," 
Zolin said. "He turned to the case worker and said, 'Am I a criminal?' " 
</P>
<P>
"The Dependency Courts should never have been located in the environment of the 
Criminal Courts Building," he added. "That was an interim relocation that 
lasted 11 years." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awareness Rises 
</P>
<P>
The inadequacies of the Criminal Courts Building were worsened in the early 
1980s as the public and government agencies became more aware of child abuse. 
In the 1984-85 fiscal year, the caseload at the Dependency Court rose 23%. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the growing backlog of criminal cases made courtroom space 
downtown a precious commodity. Superior Court judges have said that 
overcrowding at the Criminal Courts Building could be eased considerably if the 
Dependency Courts vacated the courtrooms on the 12th floor. 
</P>
<P>
But the search for a new location for the Dependency Court was delayed by 
disagreement among officials about location and the type of facility to be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the favored plan was to create 20 courtrooms by remodeling the 
former Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department store in Alhambra. An additional 
five courtrooms were to be housed in a satellite office in Irwindale. 
Eventually, however, court officials concluded that children would be best 
served in a single, new facility. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is not without its detractors, the most influential of whom is county 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum. Schabarum cast the lone opposing vote in May, 1988, 
when the Board of Supervisors voted to build the Children's Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reason for Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hageman, Schabarum's assistant chief deputy, said the supervisor opposed 
the project largely because he believed that the project should be coordinated 
by the county Facilities Management Department, not by Zolin. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody questioning the need for better Dependency Court facilities," 
Hageman said. "It's who was doing (the construction) as much as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Zolin said he took over the reins of the project in May, 1988, under an order 
by county Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"I accepted the responsibility of putting the project together after Mr. Dixon 
made it a condition for there being a project," Zolin said, adding that 
Schabarum has long opposed efforts to build a centralized Juvenile Court 
facility. "Mr. Schabarum has criticized that decision by Mr. Dixon. That may 
explain his opposition since May of 1988, but Mr. Schabarum has a record" of 
opposing a new central Juvenile Court for 10 to 12 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum's opposition was based, Zolin said, on his belief that the public 
would be better served by five satellite children's courts spread throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Mr. Schabarum will express that opinion again when the issue is 
before the supervisors" in March, Zolin said. "He favors five satellites, but 
our studies clearly indicate that it's more cost-beneficial to have a 
centralized program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposes 'Taj Mahal' 
</P>
<P>
Hageman said Schabarum's opposition to the project was not based primarily on 
his preference for satellite courts, but added: "He thought it could be done at 
less expense by not building a Taj Mahal." Schabarum has not decided whether he 
will oppose the project when the board votes on its final design and 
construction next month. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to encounter little opposition from the Monterey Park 
City Council at a public hearing Wednesday night. Although the project violates 
a city ordinance prohibiting the construction of buildings over two stories, 
council members said they see no problem with the six-story courthouse because 
it will be separated by a freeway from the rest of Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any problem with excluding it (from the height limit)," Mayor 
Barry Hatch said. "We're pretty stiff on the height limit, but I think this is 
an area where we can bend on it." 
</P>
<P>
Hatch said the Children's Court project will yield social benefits to the 
county and a financial return to the city. The Children's Court site was traded 
by Monterey Park's Community Redevelopment Agency to the county in exchange for 
land on the east side of the Long Beach Freeway, near the Los Angeles Corporate 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park officials had sought to attract a developer to build a hotel near 
the corporate center. However, they were unable to conclude a deal for a hotel 
on their original site, which was relatively inaccessible and had the Sybil 
Brand Institute, the county women's jail, as a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
"The land (where the court is to be located) is of little value to us," Hatch 
said. As a result of the land swap, he said, Monterey Park has a much better 
location for a hotel and the county has an adequate site for the Children's 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely need the court," Hatch said. "It's for children who are in 
trouble, not problem children. We see it as a contribution to a great need."

MONROVIA TO MAKE OWNERS PAY TENANTS IF MOBILE PARKS CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MONROVIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners who plan to convert mobile home parks to other uses may have to pay 
displaced tenants up to $5,000 apiece or buy their homes under an ordinance 
passed by the City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners will have to compensate displaced tenants under the same standards 
as a public agency acquiring private property under eminent domain, said City 
Atty. Richard Morillo. 
</P>
<P>
Sunnyvale and San Jose in Northern California have enacted similar ordinances 
in the last three years, Morillo said, but Monrovia is apparently the first 
city in Southern California to require park owners to purchase the mobile homes 
at fair market value if they cannot be moved within a 20-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously passed the ordinance Tuesday, seven months after 
residents of Park Santa Anita on 5th Avenue appealed to the council to save the 
park from closure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intend to Sell 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Sherman of Pasadena and the Harold Looney Trust in Escondido, who have 
jointly owned the 64-space park for 20 years, intend to sell the five-acre 
property for commercial development, said Beverly Southers, a Carlsbad 
developer representing them. The owners have not announced when they will close 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
"We are appalled at the position the city has taken," Southers said in an 
interview. "It's very unfair. The city is telling us we cannot make a profit on 
our own land." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Steve Andersen, who represents Southers and the park owners, said the 
ordinance is discriminatory because it was tailored for the Park Santa Anita 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
But Mayor Robert Bartlett noted in an interview Monday that the measure would 
apply to all three mobile home parks in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very humanistic approach," Bartlett said. "I don't think money alone 
can ever (compensate displaced tenants), really." 
</P>
<P>
The two other parks have about 100 mobile homes, said Community Development 
Director Don Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permit Required 
</P>
<P>
Because the Santa Anita property is zoned for planned development, a 
conditional-use permit is required for any new use. The park's owners have not 
yet applied for such a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Before granting the permit, the council must approve a relocation impact report 
describing the effects of the closure on the mostly elderly tenants at Park 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett and Councilwoman Lara Blakely have met as a council subcommittee with 
the 38 remaining tenants to decide whether the impact report the park owners 
filed in November was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council voted unanimously to reject the report as 
"significantly deficient." 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 10 memorandum to the council, the subcommittee criticized the impact 
report for suggesting that the Monrovia Redevelopment Agency help pay to 
relocate the tenants. The subcommittee also concluded that the report did not 
fully describe the trauma tenants would experience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elderly Tenants 
</P>
<P>
Blakely told the council that more than half the residents are over 70 and have 
lived in the park more than 15 years. Twenty-one meet federal low-income 
criteria, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance establishes what information must be provided in relocation 
impact reports. It also empowers the city manager to block rent increases above 
fair market value before a park is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Daly, secretary of Park Santa Anita's tenant association, said the 
owners increased all monthly rents to $325 as of Feb. 1. Daly said she had been 
paying $239, while other tenants had been paying as little as $180 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which took effect immediately, requires a park owner to pay 
displaced tenants for temporary housing and for moving the mobile home to 
another park. In addition, a displacement allowance of $3,000 to $5,000 must be 
provided for each household. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Further Costs 
</P>
<P>
If a mobile home cannot be relocated within a 20-mile radius, because it is too 
old to move or the tenant cannot find a suitable site, the park owner must 
purchase it and pay for moving the tenant's personal belongings to a new 
location. 
</P>
<P>
To offset the cost of new housing, an owner must provide up to $15,000 to cover 
the difference over a four-year period between that cost and what the tenant 
had paid at the park. 
</P>
<P>
The park owner may be required to continue paying the difference for an 
additional four years, again with a ceiling of $15,000, if the relocated tenant 
is a senior or handicapped low-income resident who had lived in the park at 
least 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The 26 mobile home owners who have left the park since Southers announced the 
closure last May will not be eligible for the benefits because the ordinance is 
not retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact Mitigated 
</P>
<P>
According to Morillo, state law allows cities to impose conditions on park 
owners so that the impact on relocated residents is mitigated, as long as the 
requirements are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that park owners may request a waiver of all the requirements if 
they can show that the costs would be excessive. To support such a claim, an 
owner must provide statements showing profits and losses for the previous five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Brooks, regional director of the Western Mobilehome Assn., a trade 
group of mobile home park owners, criticized the ordinance's requirement that 
owners buy the homes if relocation is not viable. 
</P>
<P>
According to the council subcommittee's Jan. 10 report, 80% of a mobile home's 
value lies in its location in a mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
"You're forcing the owner to literally buy back his own land," Brooks told the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
She cited a ruling by a Santa Cruz County Superior Court in April that an 
ordinance in the city of Scotts Valley was unconstitutional partially because 
of a similar requirement to buy back mobile homes. Morillo said the decision is 
being appealed.

FOR WORD-HERDER LARRY MCMURTRY, NOVEL IS LIKE A TRAIL DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a writer whose novels are often set under big Western skies and populated 
with ranchers and gunslingers, Larry McMurtry is strikingly bookish. Here is a 
man who, any day, would rather be nosing through dusty volumes than kicking sod 
on the prairie. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is the son of a West Texas rancher, McMurtry, whose Pulitzer 
Prize-winning epic "Lonesome Dove" was serialized in four parts on CBS-TV 
starting last Sunday, confessed one night recently that he never quite got the 
hang of cowpoking. Early on, he acquired an antipathy to cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child, I was tremendously indifferent to the comings and goings of these 
animals," McMurtry told a standing-room-only audience in the Donald R. Wright 
Auditorium of the Pasadena Public Library. "As I got older, this was a 
puzzlement to my father, who could pick any of our cattle out of a herd, day or 
night. If I was ever sent out to fetch a steer, I'd return with the wrong 
animal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reading Habit Acquired Early 
</P>
<P>
He also acquired, early on, the book-reading habit. When he was 6 years old, he 
said, a cousin, bound for World War II, gave him a box of boys' literature. "I 
read those 19 books over and over again," said McMurtry, 52. "Essentially, they 
were my library for the next 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, a big man whose eyes, behind dark-rimmed glasses, sometimes glint 
with flashes of irascibility, talked in a practiced, low-key style with just a 
hint of the Panhandle in his voice. He spoke of the colossal differences 
between novel writing and movie making: "One is private and cheap, and one is 
collaborative and expensive." 
</P>
<P>
He described his current project, a novel about fathers and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about a woman who doesn't meet her father until she's 22 years old," said 
McMurtry. "By then, she has two children, each by a different criminal." 
</P>
<P>
And he worried openly about his finite resources as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 novels and two books of essays under his belt, McMurtry has clearly 
established himself as one of America's most popular and compelling 
contemporary authors. His novels include "Horseman, Pass By" (adapted for the 
screen as "Hud"), "Terms of Endearment," "The Last Picture Show," "Texasville" 
and, most recently, "Anything for Billy," based loosely on the last days of 
Billy the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
His stories are often mordant, full of violence, plot switchbacks and an 
uncompromising realism, debunking traditionally overwrought descriptions of the 
Old West. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the narrator in "Anything for Billy," a writer of pulp Westerns, 
sums up a particularly bloody Wild West shoot-out as "just a long hot boring 
day, with a certain amount of fear mixed in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry's books are also full of eccentrically original characters. Three of 
his women characters have provided Academy Award-winning roles for the 
actresses who portrayed them on film: Ruth Popper in "The Last Picture Show," 
played by Cloris Leachman; Alma in "Hud," played by Patricia Neal, and Aurora 
Greenway in "Terms of Endearment," played by Shirley MacLaine. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, who said he will open a rare-books store in Orange County this month 
or next, joked that he had decided recently that he was not a total failure as 
a trail-driving herdsman, as his father once thought. "In a sense, I herd words 
into little sentences and sentences into paragraphs. Eventually, I herd them 
all into books." 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Dove," probably McMurtry's most widely praised novel, is the story of 
a 19th-Century trail drive from the Mexican border to Canada. The television 
version stars Robert Duvall, Anjelica Huston, Tommy Lee Jones, Danny Glover and 
Ricky Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
The author's comments about the role of books in his life were not just idle 
autobiographical detail. Reading, more than anything else, leads to writing, 
McMurtry contended. 
</P>
<P>
"During the '30s, '40s and '50s," he said, "the dust jackets of novels always 
gave a long list of the professions that the author had practiced -- 
lumberjack, cowboy, merchant seaman, railroad brakeman, etc., etc. The idea was 
that a wide experience could somehow translate into novels." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, fellow novelist Walker Percy ("one of my heroes," said 
McMurtry) spent 15 years just reading while he recovered from tuberculosis. 
"All those years, while his contemporaries were having their experiences, 
Walker Percy read and read," he said. "And out came 'The Moviegoer' (Percy's 
highly acclaimed first novel)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice to Read 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry's advice to would-be novelists: "If you want to be a writer, you 
read." The author also made these points: 
</P>
<P>
Writing fiction is "truly making up stories," not recording real-life gossip or 
scandals. "There's a kind of Puritan suspicion against fiction," he said. "Many 
people like to believe that writers (of novels) are, in a sense, journalists." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the life you've lived that excites the fiction writer, it's the life 
you haven't lived." McMurtry said he finds "attempting to project yourself into 
the feelings of a 50-year-old woman" more challenging than writing about 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I write very early in the morning. I lead a very Spartan life. My typewriter 
is about three steps from my bed." 
</P>
<P>
"Lonesome Dove" is full of historical omissions. "I forgot the railroad, for 
one thing. I even wrote in the margin to put it in -- to have the cattle 
crossing the railroad. But I ignored my own note." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry rarely gives interviews. "Offer readers a choice between a page of 
opinions in a newspaper and an 852-page novel like 'Lonesome Dove,' and a great 
many of them may be satisfied with the newspaper interview." 
</P>
<P>
On the current ascendancy of Texans in the White House: "George Bush isn't a 
Texan, he's a Yankee. . . . (Secretary of State) James Baker, he's a Texas 
Princetonian, a strange species. . . . At a time when Washington is most loaded 
up with professional Texans, I'm glad to be elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
When he talked about writing, McMurtry showed a fretful, vulnerable side. 
There's no guarantee that you can't "lose it" in a flash. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry admitted thinking, after he completed "Terms of Endearment" in 1975, 
that this had happened to him. He inexplicably lost his conviction as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
Partly, he suggested, it was because of the death in that novel of the 
cancer-stricken Emma Horton, a character who had appeared in his last three 
novels. "I was just as involved with her as I could be with a living person." 
</P>
<P>
Inexorably, he said, his writer's edge began to fuzz over. "My writing began to 
seem leaden. It's like, 'Have I seen this sentence before?' Characters that 
appear in your new book seem strangely similar to characters in your old books. 
. . . I didn't get it back for nine years." 
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came while he wrote the novel "The Desert Rose," based on a 
Las Vegas showgirl he met while researching a screenplay. "It was a little 
book," said McMurtry. Although his usual way of writing is plodding and 
"metronomic," he said, "I wrote it in three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Without that rush of pent-up creativity, McMurtry said, "Lonesome Dove," with 
which he had struggled since 1971, "might have remained just a half-written 
manuscript in a drawer." 
</P>
<P>
The experience rebuilt his confidence, but it also chastened him. "You can't 
count on being there forever," he said. "You have to keep struggling with it."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE

<P>
To Kill Raises 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 380 to 48, the House passed a resolution (HJ Res 129) disapproving 
pay raises proposed for members of Congress, federal judges and top officials 
of the executive branch. The measure was then adopted by the Senate and sent to 
President Bush for his signature officially killing the pay raises. The 
increases were proposed in December by a federal commission and sent to Capitol 
Hill on Jan. 9 by President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional salaries would have risen nearly 51% to $135,000 under the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Craig James (R-Fla.), who supported the resolution, said he was glad the House 
did not permit the raises to take effect automatically. "Allowing this absurd 
increase to go into effect without a vote would have constituted an ethical 
atrocity that this body would not have been able to live down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pay raise supporter Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), told colleagues: "It's high time 
we stop whipping ourselves" over the pay issue because "each member of this 
house, Democrat and Republican, is worth a salary of $135,000."

To Force a Pay Vote 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 88 to 238, the House rejected a parliamentary strategy to avert a 
direct vote on proposed pay increases for members of Congress, federal judges 
and top executive branch employees. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican leaders had hoped to sidestep a vote by keeping the 
House out of session until after the Feb. 8 date on which the raises were to 
take effect in the absence of House and Senate blocking action. 
</P>
<P>
But with this vote on Feb. 6, the House refused to adjourn without voting on 
the pay increase. The upshot was that Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) agreed to an 
up-or-down vote (above) that scuttled the raises. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes endorsed the leadership plan to allow the pay increases to 
take effect Feb. 8 without a record vote in the House.

PLAYWRIGHT-ACTOR TRANSMUTES A PAINFUL TIME INTO A FUNNY, PROFANE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

She clobbers him. He bites her. She pours hot water over his head. He slashes 
his wrist and flicks the blood on a qcanvas he's painting. She reads. He stomps 
on broken glass. She sneers. He screams. She has another cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
Such is life in the very personal landscape of Raymond J. Barry's 
semi-autobiographical play, "Once in Doubt," at the Cast-at-the-Circle Theatre 
in Hollywood. It is an arty, self-conscious and unabashedly profane study of an 
artist's obsessive relationship with his work, his lady and the quizzical 
neighbor who wanders into their love/hate nest. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some nights when the audience howls with laughter when I start 
making a collage out of my own blood," said the playwright, who co-stars in the 
production with Kim O'Kelley and Harvey Perr. "I love it when they laugh -- 
because it is funny. But the point is, I know where that idea came from. I went 
through that pain." 
</P>
<P>
The product of a self-described "dysfunctional family" (both parents were 
alcoholics), Barry, 49, remembers himself as a young overachiever, a "serious 
jock" who majored in philosophy at Brown University -- and upon graduation, 
found himself drafted by the New England Patriots and accepted at the Yale 
Drama School. He chose Yale, but soon found that acting was a bumpy ride. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
At 24, a bottomless anxiety attack sent Barry reeling. He taught high school, 
then worked as a longshoreman. He immersed himself in drawing, painting and 
sculpture. But by 1968, he was touring Europe as part of Joseph Chaikin's Open 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Back in New York, he co-directed the Puerto Rican Writer's Workshop with the 
late Miguel Pinero. He also appeared in more than 75 stage productions, picking 
up two Obie awards -- for "Leaf People" and "Molly's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
His most recent role was Tom Cruise's father in the upcoming Oliver 
Stone-directed film, "Born on the Fourth of July," the story of disabled 
veteran/war protester Ron Kovic. 
</P>
<P>
"You get so saturated with the subject matter," the actor said wearily. "I'm 
glad to get away from that experience. I can't even read about it now. It was a 
real heavy-duty trip. But politically, it was very important to me. I've never 
been in a film so important. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not your typical film actor," he said. "I came here for whatever reasons. 
It began to get crazy in New York. I needed money. I was evicted from my loft." 
</P>
<P>
Although he once turned down roles in 13 consecutive plays he "didn't love," he 
said yes to Michael Cimino's 1985 film "Year of the Dragon" -- and later, 
"Dragon" co-writer Oliver Stone remembered the actor for "Born on the Fourth of 
July." 
</P>
<P>
Other Barry credits include the crooked cop chasing Anthony Michael Hall in 
"Out of Bounds," an evil senator in "Three for the Road" with Charlie Sheen, 
and "the bad guy" in the Eric Roberts made-for-cable film "Slow Burn." 
</P>
<P>
Barry makes no apologies for his commercial detour. "One day you turn around 
and you're 40, and you're broke," he said. "And you think, 'Hey, maybe I should 
make some bread.' " In 1985, he moved to a duplex in the Fairfax district -- 
and has been living happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
"See how quiet this place is," he said, gesturing to the art- and 
sculpture-filled room around him. "I've done all these drawings since I've been 
here. I've done books and books of writing. You know why? Because I can isolate 
here. Nobody cares about you; you just kind of fit into your little cubbyhole. 
Of course, you have to hustle for work, but in a modest kind of way." 
</P>
<P>
Barry continued, "The most I ever made in New York was $27,000. Last year, I 
made 150 grand. I did a TV series, 'The Oldest Rookie,' with Paul Sorvino. It 
was lousy, it stunk, it was the dumbest thing I ever did in my life, but," he 
said with a laugh, "I made a hundred grand doing it. What can I tell you? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm old enough, so I don't take it all so seriously," Barry said. "But the 
fact is, I am serious -- maybe too serious. I know I'm contradicting myself. 
I'm serious about all the work I do. That's the honest truth. It doesn't matter 
what it is. And that gets in my way. 'Cause I'll do something like 'Oldest 
Rookie' and try to make it work -- and there's no substance in the material. 
And I'll end up frustrated, whipping myself, unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
Now, looking at his 50th birthday, Barry (who has a 16-year-old daughter, Oona, 
by an earlier marriage) says he has come to terms with his actor's life. 
"Theater is my metaphor for learning and experiencing this thing we call life," 
he said. "I could've been a painter or a writer or a football coach, but this 
is what I chose. And I take everything that comes with it." 
</P>
<P>
The pain that's all-too-evident in the play, Barry added, is long past. "I took 
me six years to write that," he said. "I started writing those scenes between 
the man and the woman in the aftermath of breaking up with a woman I had been 
living with. But all this happened a long time ago. So sometimes now I feel 
that I've outgrown it. I wrote it, choreographed it; I'm acting in it. But to 
some degree, it's a past life." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Barry allows, some aspects remain. "I feel different from most people," 
he said. "There's something that makes me . . . different. I have a very high 
threshold for pain. I know I went through a lot. And I have it in my mind to 
produce some statement about myself. I don't care if it's a drawing, painting, 
sculpture or play. It's like 'Hey, everyone, this is my life. Come on over, the 
joke's on me.' "

THE FOOD'S THE STAR AT 24-HOUR PENNYFEATHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are those actors, maybe? Pennyfeathers is the La Cienega cousin of a Greenwich 
Village hangout, a 24-hour place that's said not to really get going until 
after midnight. Of course it's only about 7 now, but possibly the striking, 
gorgeously dressed young couple that just glided in the door might be the first 
swallows of spring, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
No. No, they're probably models. For one thing, their clothes are fiercely 
up-to-date. If they were actors and they could afford these clothes, their 
faces would have to be familiar. And they might be striking poses, but they 
don't seem to be trying to think of dynamite things to say to each other at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I'm having a few doubts. Pennyfeathers doesn't really look much like a 
hangout for exotic post-midnight types. It's what you might call a neutral or 
background-type environment, a shoe-box room lightened by white walls and track 
lighting and the occasional high-style poster. Plus a whole lot of potted 
plants, so many you expect to find a sign reading, "Every Plant on These Walls 
for Sale." 
</P>
<P>
Now three young men are striding in the door, dressed as ruggedly as 
bike-riding bandits. They're probably not actors, though, more likely fringies. 
They have the look of having given up the hope that one day the whole world's 
going to be gazing at them. 
</P>
<P>
So we can go back to our food. What do we have here? As a 24-hour place, 
Pennyfeathers is, in effect, a sort of upscale version of the Pantry. There are 
moments of Italian food, and a quiche du jour, but basically it's American 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit No. 1: the burger. Pennyfeathers boasts of 40 burgers here, presumably 
based on combinations of condiments that can be added, at 80 per. It's a good 
burger, anyway, a thick grilled patty on a whole wheat bun with lettuce, onion 
and tomato on the side awaiting your specific orders. Incidentally, if you ask 
for salsa as one of the options, it doesn't come on the burger but in a 
separate bowl for dipping; a good idea, if a bit East Asian for the burger 
context. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit No. 2: barbecue. The chicken and the ribs are decently barbecued, but 
the surprise is that the sauce is not the dilettantish sort you'd expect in a 
place that has a pasta of the day. It's a real central city model, not terribly 
hot but full-flavored and probably based on grape jelly rather than molasses. 
This excellent sauce occasionally comes with other things, such as a special 
appetizer called "a loaf of fried onions" -- onion rings, that is, a little 
loosely breaded but nice and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibit No. 3: the short ribs. These are, surprisingly, not the usual rib tips 
with noodles but a flanken cut of braised beef over which a sauce of tomato, 
carrot and celery have later been poured, giving a moderately convincing 
last-minute impression of a home-style pot roast. It comes with a whole lot of 
perfectly cooked broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian side of Pennyfeathers is a lasagna on the unchanging menu augmented 
by pastas of the day, which often seem to be variations on fettuccine Alfredo. 
I've had a fettuccine with somebody else's Italian name that was Alfredo plus 
some Italian sausage, with about half a loaf of mild garlic bread inserted into 
it around the edges of the plate. It did not seem likely to make the new guy's 
name as famous as Alfredo's, but it wasn't bad. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
In the best 24-hour tradition, Pennyfeathers makes decent soups. They change 
all the time, but I've had a tomato soup that was thick and sweet (like 
Campbell's, come to think of it, only with chunks of onion in it), and a 
thinner tomato soup with hot pepper and navy beans in it, and a pretty good 
turkey-vegetable soup that was unfortunately misnamed "turkey gumbo." 
</P>
<P>
Pennyfeathers also serves a good old-fashioned root beer. And the basic dessert 
menu is best when it runs to chocolate. There's a chocolate cake that is as 
chocolatey as can be. "I don't care how bad you feel," says my guest, sinking 
her fork into it again, "you'll feel OK when you eat this," a chocolate Grand 
Marnier mousse cake with chocolate cookie crust. 
</P>
<P>
OK, in the door come two women of considerable self-possession. They sit down 
in a corner and wave for a waiter. Actresses at last? 
</P>
<P>
No, probably antique-shoppers from up La Cienega. I have to face the fact that 
I'm not going to get the full use of Pennyfeathers. I just dine too early in 
the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: tomato soup (cup), 95 cents; barbecued ribs, $10.95; 
chocolate cake, $2.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennyfeathers, 631 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 659-3545. Open 24 
hours. Full bar. Street parking. American Express, MasterCard and Visa 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $16 to $40.

50% CUT SET IN FEDERAL WATER SUPPLIES IN STATE; 
</P>
<P>
ACTION REQUIRED BY DROUGHT MAY CAUSE SOME FARMERS TO FAIL AND DRIVE UP FOOD 
PRICES

SACRAMENTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Central Valley farmers and some Northern California cities served by federal 
water projects are being told their deliveries will be cut by up to 50%, a move 
that could put some farmers out of business and lead to water rationing in 
urban areas, federal officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, California's largest single 
supplier of water, are likely to reduce the state's crop production by an 
estimated $250 million and drive up food prices in local supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Brought on by the state's third dry year in a row, the reductions will take 
effect March 1. It will be the first time since the drought of 1976-77 that the 
federal water system will be unable to provide all the water its contractors 
are entitled to receive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Tough Year' 
</P>
<P>
"Some farmers are going to go belly up," said John B. Budd, a spokesman for the 
Bureau of Reclamation. "They just won't be able to make it through the year. 
It's going to be a tough year for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the amount of water available through the federal system 
compounds an already bleak situation. Officials of the state water project, 
which provides the state with nearly half as much water as the federal system, 
already has announced that farmers can expect a 40% cutback in water supplies 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
"California's water picture remains dominated by drought," the state Department 
of Water Resources said in its February water report. "The next two months will 
determine whether there will be enough water, or whether California will have 
its first three-year critically dry spell of this century." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Far Below Normal 
</P>
<P>
Both the federal and state decisions to reduce water supplies could be altered 
if California is drenched by huge storms in the next two months. However, the 
state is so far behind in precipitation that it would take a storm of the 
magnitude seen only once every 100 years to bring California up to normal 
levels, Budd said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will the expected water shortage hurt farmers and inconvenience city 
dwellers, it is likely to further damage sensitive salmon fisheries, reduce the 
amount of hydroelectric power that can be produced and limit recreational 
activities on federal and state reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
The federal and state cutbacks will not directly affect Los Angeles and other 
Southern California communities. However, Los Angeles is experiencing problems 
of its own because of reduced snowpack in the eastern Sierra Nevada, the source 
of most of the city's water. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is going to be better off than San Francisco is," Budd said. 
"They're going to have some conservation measures they'll have to go along 
with, but that's a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
Among the urban areas that depend most heavily on water from the Bureau of 
Reclamation are the San Jose region and communities east of Sacramento such as 
Orangevale and Fair Oaks. With reduced supplies of federal water, these areas 
could face serious shortages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Jose Problems 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Clara Valley, for example, San Jose and its neighboring cities 
will receive half of their federal allotment. They already have heavily tapped 
the ground water supply during the last two dry years. Now increased pumping 
could cause the earth to subside, snapping underground pipes and undermining 
the foundations of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Schild, assistant regional director of the Bureau of Reclamation, said the 
agency will try to help the San Jose region find alternate supplies, but water 
rationing ultimately may be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Among farmers, the federal cutbacks pose the greatest threat to growers in the 
western San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys, whose contracts with the bureau 
allow for reductions of 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers located nearer the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers face cutbacks of 
only 25% because their contracts take into account the original water rights 
attached to the property before the federal water system was constructed. 
</P>
<P>
Schild estimated that the water cutbacks will affect 1 million acres of 
farmland. Some farmers may decide to let their land lie fallow or plant crops 
that require less water. Other growers may pump additional water from the 
ground, manage their supplies better or find more expensive sources of water, 
which in turn would drive up the cost of food. 
</P>
<P>
"Some will divert to ground water," Schild said. "Others simply are not going 
to make it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notification Deadline 
</P>
<P>
Farmers must be notified by Feb. 15 of any cutbacks in their federal allotments 
so they can decide what crops to plant and how many acres to farm, Schild said. 
If California does not receive substantial rainfall in the next seven weeks, 
any increases in the supply would be too late for most farmers to alter their 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Reclamation's decision to reduce water supplies comes as 
California recovers from a storm that blanketed the state and dropped snow in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said it will take much more than a storm like that to avert a 
drought. The ground is so dry it soaks up the rainwater "like a sponge," Budd 
said. Federal and state reservoirs, nearly drained during the last two years, 
remain far below normal levels. And this year's snowpack, while great for 
skiing, has an unusually low water content, reducing the amount of expected 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
The last time there were three consecutive dry years in California was in 1614, 
judging from an analysis of the rings on ancient trees. It has never happened 
in the state's recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Bureau of Reclamation delivered about 6.5 million acre feet of 
water to its customers. This year, the bureau expects to deliver only about 4 
million acre feet. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that it will turn around," Budd said. "I just think you 
have to plan for the worst."

AFGHAN WOMEN FEAR FOR RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE

PESHAWAR, Pakistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nine years, Tajwar Kakar has been fighting Afghanistan's "holy war" in her 
own way. 
</P>
<P>
Kakar, a 40-year-old schoolteacher, was imprisoned and tortured for more than a 
year in Kabul, the Afghan capital, for opposing the Soviet invasion in 1979. 
Five years ago, she fled with her husband and seven children and started 
schools for Afghan refugee girls in this Pakistani border town. 
</P>
<P>
She teaches them that, even in Islam, women have rights -- all the more so 
because of the role Afghan women have played in the guerrilla war against the 
Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, as the rebels were on the verge of victory after forcing the 
withdrawal of Soviet troops, Kakar got her reward -- a death threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Half a Dozen Warnings 
</P>
<P>
It came from one of the fundamentalist parties in the moujahedeen rebel 
alliance, and it was one of half a dozen letters she has received warning her 
to stop teaching the refugee girls that Islam does not require them to wear the 
burkha, the customary head-to-foot dress. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the last warning we are going to give you," the letter said. "If you 
do not accept this custom, we are going to kill you." 
</P>
<P>
The incident not only underscores the deep ideological divisions among the 
rebels, it also points up the dilemma facing the millions of Afghan refugee 
women who have been changed by the war and face the prospect of going home to a 
country where the change will not be welcome. Indeed, the fundamentalist 
Islamic regime that is expected to take over in Afghanistan will offer women 
less freedom than the one that drove them out. 
</P>
<P>
"We women have fought hard for the freedom of our people and our nation," Kakar 
said angrily, folding the warning letter. "We have been imprisoned and 
tortured. Some of us have been killed. And we have been the shield for the men 
who carried on this holy war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for Rights 
</P>
<P>
"Now that Afghanistan is returning to the people, why don't they think about 
women's rights? The women helped fight the holy war, and now they don't care 
about us." 
</P>
<P>
"They" are two fervently fundamentalist political parties in the seven-party 
rebel alliance that Pakistan and the United States helped organize as a conduit 
for billions of dollars in arms and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the weapons are known to have gone to the most fundamentalist 
of the seven party leaders, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, in part because the late 
Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq wanted to form a fundamentalist Islamic belt 
from Iran to India. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, Hekmatyar has become a powerful force in the rebel alliance 
-- a force that has met with increasing criticism from many of the 3 million 
Afghan refugees in camps in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Hekmatyar was largely responsible for the collapse Friday of a 
rebel leaders' conference here to form a government to replace the 
Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. Kakar opposed the conference, for example, 
because the fundamentalist-dominated alliance refused to allocate a single seat 
to the women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devout Muslims 
</P>
<P>
She said that she and most other Afghans are devout Muslims but that the 
religion practiced for centuries in the villages of Afghanistan has few of the 
trappings of the modern fundamentalism that Hekmatyar advocates. 
</P>
<P>
Another party leader, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, is backed by Saudi Arabia and is 
identified with the Wahabbi sect of Islam. Many refugees view his prominent 
position in the rebel alliance as evidence of foreign ideology encroaching on 
traditional Afghan culture. 
</P>
<P>
Asked who had sent her the threatening letter, Kakar replied: "It is signed 
'students,' but they are Gulbuddin and Sayyaf people. It is very clear. They 
believe that women have no role in the future society in Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Imprisonment 
</P>
<P>
She pointed toward a woman sitting nearby, Mina Azizi, who is 23 but looks a 
decade older. Azizi has spent the last seven years in prisons in Kabul. At 15, 
she was imprisoned for a year at the headquarters of the Afghan secret police, 
known as Khad, after she was caught with rebel documents while acting as a 
courier. 
</P>
<P>
Removing her sunglasses, Azizi showed that she was barely able to open her left 
eye, which looks in a different direction from her swollen right eye. 
</P>
<P>
"They used electric shocks and forced her eyelids open in bright light for days 
at a time," Kakar said. "She needs many eye operations. But the (rebel 
political) parties will not let her into their hospitals here. None of these 
parties will help her, and it is only because she is a woman." 
</P>
<P>
Aid workers from the United Nations and independent foreign agencies working 
with the refugees confirmed that women are largely ignored by the rebel 
alliance. They have been given less freedom in the refugee camps here than they 
had in their villages, and they receive much less food and care than the men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100,000 War Widows 
</P>
<P>
One aid worker said that more than 100,000 of the refugees are war widows and 
that the women's sacrifices in the war have been greater than the men's. 
</P>
<P>
"They have lost husbands, children, entire families," the aid worker said. "And 
still, when they arrive here, they say their role in this war is to have more 
children, more sons, more holy warriors to carry on this crusade. 
</P>
<P>
"But after many years in the camps, these women have changed. It's true that 
some of the parties have ignored them, but through the international agencies 
working here, they have been exposed to education, many of them for the first 
time. They have been told they have rights, and for them to go back to a 
fundamentalist society now just will not work." 
</P>
<P>
Kakar makes the same argument. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have been teaching these women is that the holy war is like a bird," 
she said. "A bird when it flies needs two wings. A holy war also needs two 
wings. One is the man, one is the woman. And a bird, like this holy war, cannot 
fly very well with only one wing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clearly Dangerous 
</P>
<P>
Such ideas, and the fact that Kakar does not hesitate to make them public, are 
clearly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Other refugee leaders and intellectuals have also been threatened. One of the 
most outspoken was killed in Peshawar a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But when a reporter volunteered to withhold Kakar's name to protect her, she 
would have none of it. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I am not afraid of these things," she said, half-smiling. "I am a good 
Muslim, and my faith teaches me that the only one who can save us is God. The 
only one who can kill us is God. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in prison, the Russians always said, 'We will kill you if you do 
not cooperate.' I said to them then, 'Only God can kill me,' and I say the same 
to these people now. Only God can take away my life."

PLO'S PEACE MOVES ERODE SUPPORT IN LEBANON CAMPS

TYRE, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization is struggling to hold onto its 
grass-roots followers in refugee camps across Lebanon as refugees rebel against 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's moves to open peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In Rashidiyeh, an impoverished camp near Tyre in southern Lebanon, hundreds of 
demonstrators marched in protest last month, brandishing rifles, chanting 
slogans and waving the red, white, green and black Palestinian flag. A week 
later, residents of the Ein el Hilwa camp in the port of Sidon, 25 miles north 
of Tyre, also protested. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees are chafing under orders issued by the PLO's majority Fatah 
faction, headed by Arafat, to refrain from infiltrating and making raids on 
Israel -- the traditional, if largely unsuccessful, strategy of the past. They 
also complain bitterly about an economic squeeze caused by salary cuts that 
Arafat ordered for guerrillas languishing in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to tell fighters that after 20 years or 40 years, they may have to 
do something else, stop fighting for now, take up a trade," one Western relief 
official said. "This is a problem with all such movements, and it is a problem 
for the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
The restlessness indicates the PLO's difficulties in gaining support for its 
new, moderate policy, which has shifted away from fighting Israel and toward 
creation of a Palestinian state. And it suggests its leaders do not have 
unlimited time to show results. 
</P>
<P>
An official of an international relief agency in Lebanon observed: "There is a 
feeling the clock is ticking on Arafat. He has to work hard to convince his 
people that he is not wasting time." 
</P>
<P>
To ease discontent, the PLO recently dispatched top officials from Beirut to 
the camps to insist that Arafat's diplomacy is gaining ground and that the 
budget cuts -- designed to divert funds to the 14-month-old Palestinian 
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip -- are temporary. 
</P>
<P>
As an added morale booster, a group of 13 Palestinians recently expelled from 
the occupied territories lectured the refugees on the gains of the intifada, as 
the uprising is known. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees' hard-edged attitude reflects the debate among the PLO's top 
officials, Lebanese and Palestinian sources say. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, reports from Tunisia, where the PLO maintains its headquarters, 
have exposed a growing impatience with Washington. Since talks between the 
United States and the PLO began in December, the Americans have tried to focus 
mainly on ending terrorism, PLO officials say, while the Palestinians want to 
focus on ways to bring Israel to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very disappointing," said one aide to a PLO leader who has met with the 
Americans. "They're not saying anything about the behavior of the Israelis, who 
are killing civilians every day in the occupied territories." 
</P>
<P>
Another PLO spokesman added: "At the beginning, they talked of a substantial 
dialogue, but all we hear from them these days is quibbles. If they think this 
is the way to influence the PLO, I think they'll get negative results." 
</P>
<P>
In regrets expressed to a Lebanese newspaper, Nayef Hawatmeh, head of the 
radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of five PLO 
factions, lamented the willingness of "rightist" PLO officials to surrender 
"national unity" in favor of talks with the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh seemed to directly challenge the hold of Arafat's Fatah on the PLO by 
calling for an end to "dominant control" by any one segment of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attacks on Israel 
</P>
<P>
Radical PLO factions like Hawatmeh's are promising out-of-work guerrillas that 
they can take part in attacks on the northern frontier of Israel if they bolt 
from Fatah, Arab and Western sources say. The factions consider refugee camps, 
where poverty and isolation are softened only by dreams of "struggle," 
"advance" and "victory," to be fertile ground for their appeals. 
</P>
<P>
A unit of the Marxist-led Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
another PLO faction out of Arafat's direct control, recently attempted to raid 
Israel in what was considered a display of purpose designed to contrast with 
Fatah's impotence. Israeli troops operating in Israel's security zone in 
southern Lebanon aborted the raid, shooting five Palestinians in an ambush. 
</P>
<P>
News of the failed operation fueled the latest Israeli efforts to persuade the 
United States to drop contact with the PLO on grounds that it is still wedded 
to terrorism. In response, the U.S. ambassador in Tunisia expressed 
Washington's "concern" over the commando action to PLO officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discontent in Territories 
</P>
<P>
As Arafat's talks with the United States limp along, indications of discontent 
in the West Bank and Gaza also have surfaced. Both the Popular Front and 
Islamic fundamentalists operating there have criticized Arafat's willingness to 
recognize Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
The simmering skepticism is having an effect on tactics inside the intifada, 
reported one Palestinian source in Jerusalem, who is in contact with intifada 
leaders. After a few months of drift, intifada leaders are considering stepping 
up protests, beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
Although the opening of talks with Washington was an accomplishment, it is not 
an end in itself, the leaders have decided, and the uprising will have to pick 
up steam if something more is to come out of it. 
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, both Arab and Western sources report, the unhappiness has prompted 
Palestinians to take to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 Palestinians live in refugee camps run by the United Nations in 
Lebanon; another 135,000 reside outside the camps, although they are still 
registered as refugees. Altogether, about 1.5 million refugees reside in 
Lebanon, Syria and Jordan, making up a sizable constituency for the PLO. In the 
West Bank and Gaza, 800,000 Palestinians are registered as refugees out of a 
total population of 1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The first demonstration against Arafat's policies erupted in Rashidiyeh, a camp 
of 17,000 where political divisions sharpened after Arafat recognized Israel 
last fall. So split on the question is Rashidiyeh that various sectors in the 
camp are controlled by different PLO factions. Passage from one cinder-block 
neighborhood to another depends upon the whims of armed mini-militias -- a 
version of the fractured geography of Lebanese cities, like Beirut, gripped by 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
"In this camp, Fatah has not imposed its control," said Hassan, a Lebanese 
member of a local militia that has access to the camp. "To do so now would mean 
war, and it wants to avoid that. So it lets things go on in this tense way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effort to Dispel Tension 
</P>
<P>
As part of the effort to dispel that tension, the group of Palestinians 
expelled from the West Bank and Gaza Strip had planned to affirm Arafat's 
leadership as the most representative of all Palestinian interests. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get everyone unified. We are united in the intifada, and that is 
what has kept us going," said Rizek Bayari, a local leader from Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the divisions among the refugees, Bayari responded with the 
colorful, if sometimes empty, Arab rhetoric: "Sometimes when brothers live in 
the same house, they fight. But they are still brothers." 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who encountered the traveling exiles in Tyre were barred from going 
with them into Rashidiyeh. Passions were too raw for exposure to foreigners, 
the Palestinians explained. 
</P>
<P>
Bayari conceded that some aspects of the PLO's new moderation were bound to 
bother the refugees, notably its ambiguity about the "right of return," a 
long-held dogma among Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The "right of return" claims the prerogative of all Palestinians to go back to 
their place of origin, even if it is now inside Israel proper. Thousands of 
Arabs were driven from their homes during various Israeli-Arab wars. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Palestinians in the West Bank have begun to speak of exchanging the 
"right of return" for monetary compensation. But such a move would leave 
refugees like those in Rashidiyeh in a foreign land among clannish people who 
have never welcomed their presence. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of the right of return should be the last one brought up in any 
negotiation," the Palestinian source in Jerusalem said. "It is the one that 
could bring Arafat the most trouble."

RISING COSTS PUT MEDICARE, ELDERLY ON COLLISION COURSE

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theodore Flack, a retired miner who now lives in Washington on a low fixed 
income, suffers from high blood pressure, gout, arthritis and sinusitis. 
</P>
<P>
But he remains a vigorous and robust 6-footer despite his 76 years -- and he 
gives Medicare the credit. Without Medicare to pay for most of his medical 
care, including a three-week stay in the hospital last year, "I'd be in pretty 
bad shape," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But even as Medicare is keeping Flack healthy, federal officials across town 
are working overtime to try to restore Medicare to financial health. White 
House Budget Director Richard G. Darman is looking at Medicare's future, and he 
does not like what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare now costs less than half as much as Social Security, but if health 
care costs for the elderly keep growing at current rates, it will catch up by 
the year 2000. And by 2015, it will overtake Social Security and defense 
spending combined. Darman's job: to keep that from happening. 
</P>
<P>
Flack's medical needs and Darman's financial concerns appear to be on a 
collision course. Can the government ensure Medicare's future by cracking down 
on doctor fees and hospital costs? Can it restrain the mounting costs of 
medical technology and malpractice insurance? Or will it have to solve 
Medicare's problems on the backs of the elderly by limiting their medical 
services or increasing their share of costs? 
</P>
<P>
These are the questions that President Bush and Congress will have to grapple 
with as they put flesh on the bones of Bush's proposed $5-billion cut from 
Medicare's projected growth next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the budget documents accompanying his nationally televised speech to 
Congress on Thursday night, Bush said the cuts should be meted out on doctors 
and hospitals, not the elderly. Even with them, however, Medicare will grow 
from $84 billion in the current year to $92 billion in the next. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Bush chose not to mention the painful choices ahead for 
Medicare. Instead, he spoke in generalities about how "a decent society shows 
compassion for the young, the elderly, the vulnerable and the poor." 
</P>
<P>
Several members of Congress immediately assailed Bush's Medicare proposal. 
Suggesting a contentious battle ahead, House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) said 
edgily: "We will oppose attempts to cut Medicare." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More Friendly 
</P>
<P>
An aide to Rep. Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), longtime advocate for the elderly, says 
Bush is proving no more friendly to Medicare than former President Ronald 
Reagan. "Reagan never came up with a plan," he says. "He was always chopping 
rather than reforming." 
</P>
<P>
The politics of Medicare are familiar but gloomy. Doctors, hospitals, insurers 
and beneficiaries all assert that they are not the cause of Medicare's soaring 
costs, and they want the inevitable pain to be felt by others. 
</P>
<P>
Flack, who in 1921 began working for 50 cents a day as a 9-year-old water boy 
at a saw mill in Saluda, S.C., worked in a variety of occupations until he 
reached age 65. He then retired from his $10-an-hour job as a miner who blasted 
tunnels for the subway system. As he sees it, he has earned Medicare through 
years of paying taxes and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person is going to spend his entire life doing anything on behalf of 
himself and society," he says, "there should be some compensation that results 
from it. If you put something in, you should get something out." 
</P>
<P>
Medicare benefits not only the elderly but also their sons and daughters and 
nephews and nieces, upon whom many of the costs of caring for their older 
relatives used to fall. Dorothy Hamilton, who cares for her ailing 84-year-old 
mother in Cliffwood Beach, N.J., says: "I don't think there should be any cuts. 
It isn't sufficient enough now for people who don't have a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hospital Bill 
</P>
<P>
Medicare beneficiaries already must pay $560 for their first day of 
hospitalization, $31.90 a month toward their insurance against doctor bills, 
their first $75 a year of doctors' fees and, in general, 20% of all additional 
doctors' fees. And Medicare does not pay at all for a number of services, 
including most immunizations, dental and eye care, physical examinations, 
outpatient prescriptions and custodial care. 
</P>
<P>
From the perspective of many of Medicare's beneficiaries, doctors bear a heavy 
responsibility for the program's runaway costs. Medicare payments to doctors 
are rising three times faster than those to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Meyer, president of New Directions for Policy, a Washington research 
organization, says doctors run too many expensive laboratory tests and too 
frequently carry out unnecessary medical procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"We've reached a point when these guys have to be put on a budget like the rest 
of us," Meyer says. "We're going to have to raise the tough questions about 
what services are necessary. Certain surgical procedures are done when they are 
not called for." 
</P>
<P>
And Hamilton, a retired nurse, says some doctors simply charge too much for 
their services. "They walk in and say hello, and then you get a bill," she 
complains. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts advocate simplifying and clarifying physician fee schedules. 
"Everybody is fed up with the current method of paying," says Karen Davis of 
the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. Davis was a health 
policy planner during the Jimmy Carter Administration.

<P>
Frustrated by rising doctor costs, Congress froze Medicare reimbursements to 
doctors for about two years starting in 1984. But John Cogan, the departing 
deputy director of the White House budget office, says it was like squeezing a 
balloon -- when Congress pinched costs in one place, they popped out in 
another. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increase in Services 
</P>
<P>
"As you shrank down on the reimbursements," he says, "there simply occurred an 
increase in the number of services provided to make up for the loss of income." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors assert that they are caught between the needs of patients and the 
demands of a litigious society. If they do not take every precaution, they 
fear, a medical malpractice suit awaits them. 
</P>
<P>
"If a patient without much money asks you to limit the tests, they might wind 
up in a situation where they have a rare illness," says Dr. Russell Rothenberg, 
a Washington internist. "Suddenly it's not important that you tried to help the 
patient out and limit the amount of tests you did. That will not be something 
that will be important in a court of law. What will be important is that you 
could have done a test, and you missed it." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Marsh, comptroller and general manager of the National Capitol 
Reciprocal Insurance Co., says $1 million in coverage for obstetricians and 
gynecologists can cost anywhere from $12,000 a year in Oklahoma to $186,000 in 
Florida. The same coverage in California costs from $36,000 to $51,000, he 
said, depending on specific policy provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The exploding costs of malpractice insurance have generated calls for national 
ceilings on awards in malpractice suits. But until that happens, Marsh says, 
"we have no choice but to charge enough to cover the costs." And those costs 
are ultimately passed along to patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Painter, a Houston internist who is a member of the American Medical 
Assn. board of trustees, estimates that "defensive medicine" costs $11 billion 
a year nationwide. He attributes the rise in doctor fees to Americans' 
"insatiable appetite" for medical care, combined with the soaring cost of 
medical technology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awesome Technology 
</P>
<P>
The technology is indeed awesome, both in its capabilities and in its costs. 
Michael Minakowski, advertising coordinator for the American Society for 
Medical Technology, describes one of the latest high-tech devices -- a 
computerized chemical analyzer that allows doctors to check for the presence of 
a particular chemical in the blood simply by touching a button on a computer 
that is linked to a blood tester. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line," says Minakowski, "is that the equipment costs a lot. What 
drives the cost is Americans' insatiable desire for better and better medical 
care, even to the point when it goes beyond what is necessary. How good a 
stapler do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incentive Issue Raised 
</P>
<P>
Medicare, as it is now structured, is not equipped to discourage recipients 
from seeking better staplers, or doctors from using them. As long as most of 
the costs are passed on to the government, no one has an incentive to control 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The system, "in effect, subsidizes every contact" between patients and 
physicians," Cogan says. "The policy dilemma is to control the growth and the 
cost without fundamentally altering the physician-patient relationship. And 
nobody has found a solution to that problem." 
</P>
<P>
In the struggle to control Medicare's costs, the only notable success has been 
with hospitals. In 1983, the government abandoned the practice of reimbursing 
hospitals for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries and instead 
instituted standard payments for treatment of each of 468 different patient 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals complain it is unfair to set rates for all illnesses or injuries 
without considering the many possible variables that come into play when a 
person enters a hospital. But it has clearly contained costs. Federal payments 
to hospitals rose to $52.1 billion in fiscal 1988, a 4.5% increase over the 
previous year, while medical payments, mostly to doctors, jumped 13.6% to $34 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Extremely Fragile' 
</P>
<P>
The American Hospital Assn. is afraid of further efforts to limit hospital 
payments. "After years of ratcheting down hospital payments," says association 
President Carol McCarthy, "the condition of the hospital system today is 
extremely fragile." Inadequate payments, she says, threaten both the quality of 
health care and hospitals' ability to remain open. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts, citing hundreds of hospital closings since 1982, agree that 
hospitals have suffered enough. "We've reached a point where we've gotten 
control of hospital costs," says Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
Firing a shot across the Bush Administration's bow, a bipartisan group of 179 
House members and 36 senators on Jan. 31 supported a resolution opposing 
reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Institutions are not the only targets of Medicare cost-cutters. Government 
policy-makers will also consider proposals that would force Medicare 
beneficiaries to bear some of the burden of holding costs down. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer asserts that cost-cutting measures "are going to hit beneficiaries." He 
suggests that the government might have to increase Medicare's $75 deductible 
for coverage of doctor fees. 
</P>
<P>
The AMA favors phasing in a system under which the elderly are entitled to 
medical benefits only to the extent that they contributed to the Medicare 
system while they were working. At present, all the elderly receive full 
benefits, regardless of their job history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Slow Policy Moves 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens to Medicare will probably not happen quickly. "Policy in every 
area of government is made very incrementally, very slowly," Cogan says. "It's 
the fundamental nature of democracy. You don't see a radical policy change 
being made overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Flack hopes the policy-makers will remember "the little guy." For too 
long, he says, "the rich got richer and the poor got poorer."

HARRIS CONSECRATED IN EPISCOPAL RITES;

The Rev. Barbara Harris, with the voices of dissidents overwhelmed by cheers 
from thousands of fellow Episcopalians, on Saturday became the first woman 
elevated to bishop in a 2,000-year succession dating back to the apostles. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was greeted with a roar of approval from about 8,000 people when she 
walked down the aisle for a consecration that has drawn world attention because 
she is female and because of her background and liberal views. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt during the laying on of hands that I was part of the ongoing history of 
the church," Harris said. "I felt a part of the apostolic succession at that 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
Harris assumed the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop in the Boston 
Episcopal diocese. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter controversy over the ordination of women that has simmered since 
Harris' election in September boiled over Saturday. But objections were met by 
boos from many of those in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
During a period in the ceremony allotted for protest, John Jamieson of 
Evanston, Ill., chairman of the conservative Prayer Book Society's Chicago 
chapter, appealed to the Most Rev. Edmond Browning, chief consecrator at the 
ceremony and presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Bishop Browning, please weigh the consequences. By proceeding with this 
pretended consecration you will perpetuate a sacrilegious imposture. . . . " 
Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
A second dissident -- the Rev. James Hopkinson Cupit Jr. of New York -- said 
Harris' election has "caused grievous division" in the Anglican Communion, 
churches that follow the tradition of the Church of England, including the 
Episcopal Church in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Browning responded that the issues raised had been considered by the church and 
that the majority of bishops and diocesan standing committees had approved 
Harris' consecration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standing Ovation 
</P>
<P>
"In this circumstance, we shall proceed with the ordination," he said. The 
crowd responded with a standing ovation that lasted several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents included traditionalists who believe that because the apostles were 
men, the position of bishop must be reserved for men. Others objected to Harris 
because of her lack of a college degree and formal seminary training and 
because of her relative inexperience in parish ministerial work. Still others 
objected to her strongly liberal writings on gay rights, U.S. policy in Central 
America and internal church matters. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who is black, said she believes that some of the opposition to her 
elevation stemmed from her race as well as her sex. 
</P>
<P>
Frederick H. Borsch, bishop of the Los Angeles diocese, was among those taking 
part in the ceremony, said Bob Williams, a church spokesman. Also present were 
assistant bishops Daniel Corrigan and George Barrett of Santa Barbara and 
assistant bishop John R. Krumm of Tustin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hour service was filled with pomp and circumstance. Six choirs sang 
Mozart and spirituals. There were three separate ecclesiastical processions. 
</P>
<P>
As Harris entered the hall near the end of the third procession, the hall 
erupted into a twinkling of camera flashes. People climbed on their chairs for 
a better view while others pressed close. When the new Bishop Harris, garbed 
for the first time in the vestments and symbols of her office, was presented to 
the people, they clapped, jumped up and down and hugged each other.

MORE BYELORUSSIA LAND AFFECTED BY RADIATION FROM '86 DISASTER

Radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster is still spreading in Byelorussia 
almost three years after the accident and has contaminated one-fifth of the 
republic's arable soil, Pravda said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We harvest hundreds of thousands of tons of contaminated grain and do not know 
what to do with it," the Communist Party newspaper quoted Mikhail V. Kovalev, 
premier of the Byelorussian Soviet Republic, as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Chernobyl plant's No. 4 reactor, which exploded in April, 1986, in 
the world's worst nuclear disaster, is in the Ukrainian Republic, the 
radioactive pollution released by the accident spread north to neighboring 
Byelorussia. 
</P>
<P>
There has been little in the Soviet media about the consequences of the 
accident in Byelorussia, however, with most reports instead focusing on damage 
in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence of the Chernobyl accident and its consequences on the territory 
of Byelorussia is not diminishing," Kovalev was quoted as saying. "The 
territory is contaminated more than we supposed. More than one-fifth of the 
republic's agricultural land is contaminated." 
</P>
<P>
Kovalev said residents of the Byelorussian cities of Gomel, 100 miles north of 
Chernobyl, and Mogilyov, 200 miles from the plant, had to be given additional 
funds to defray the costs of finding uncontaminated food. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the accident, authorities marked off a 19-mile forbidden zone 
around the nuclear plant, 60 miles north of the Ukraine's capital of Kiev. They 
evacuated about 100,000 people from the area and began efforts to decontaminate 
the soil and buildings and halt radioactive fallout. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) we did not manage to stop the spreading of the contamination in 
Byelorussia," Kovalev said. "The roads have contaminated dust. The population 
uses contaminated peat and firewood." 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup in Byelorussia has cost about $1.4 billion so far, Kovalev said.

CZECH PARTY POWER STRUGGLE HINTED; 
</P>
<P>
HESITATION, INDECISION SEEN IN CRACKDOWN ON DISSIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Communist authorities here have filed charges of "incitement" against 
Vaclav Havel, a prominent playwright who was arrested during a Jan. 16 street 
demonstration, thereby resolving, at least temporarily, an internal stalemate 
over the handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
But the evident hesitation and indecision in the Communist leadership suggested 
a party power struggle may be building as officials grapple with mounting 
international pressure to relax their hard-line stance against dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Havel was arrested with 15 other activists in Prague's central Wenceslas Square 
when he tried to lay flowers to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death 
of Jan Palach, a student. Palach set himself on fire Jan. 16, 1969, to protest 
the Soviet-led invasion that ended the "Prague Spring" reforms of 1968. Most of 
those arrested were released, although 10 activists of the Charter 77 human 
rights organization were charged with "hooliganism." 
</P>
<P>
Havel, however, as the most prominent of the dissidents, has been kept in 
Ruzyne Prison while the authorities have attempted to work out a strategy to 
deal with an arrest -- and now perhaps a highly publicized trial -- that many 
of them wish had been avoided altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, whose works have long been banned, was also charged with obstructing 
police. The incitement charge carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail, 
and the obstruction charge a maximum of six months. No date was set for the 
trial, which is expected to be conducted behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criticism from Conference 
</P>
<P>
Havel's arrest, and the harsh police action that met the demonstrators last 
month, brought sharp criticism from the international human rights conference 
in Vienna, where Czechoslovakia was one of 35 nations agreeing to a broad 
package of rights and freedoms set down by the conference. The criticism came 
only days after Czechoslovakia joined in signing the rights document. 
</P>
<P>
The memorial observances for Palach began the day before Havel's arrest and 
continued for three days afterward, spurred on in part, activists say, by the 
forceful police action, which seemed to have been planned well in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The riot police used water cannon, tear gas, dogs and truncheons to break up 
the demonstrations, the most sustained series of street protests in the country 
for nearly 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Police rounded up hundreds of demonstrators, including some bystanders who were 
not participants, and herded them into police vans and buses. Those not singled 
out for interrogation were driven miles outside of Prague, where they were let 
out of the buses and told to walk home. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other activists arrested with Havel were charged with hooliganism, 
which could bring maximum penalties of two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the protests, no party official has stood up to claim 
responsibility for the heavy-handed police action, a silence that is taken by 
some diplomats and other observers as an indication of the shock that was 
registered over the events even inside the government and the party. 
</P>
<P>
Party leader Milos Jakes, the hard-nosed apparatchik who presided over the 
post-1968 party purges, has remained silent on the issue, along with the rest 
of the party leadership, allowing the official parliamentary committees to 
characterize the dissidents as "hooligans" who "only disrupt the economic and 
social rhythm in the center town." 
</P>
<P>
Many Prague observers believe the heavy police action was ordered by Miroslav 
Stepan, the Prague party leader, often mentioned as a potential successor to 
Jakes, who has held the job for just over a year and could be ousted in a party 
congress next year if the oddly muffled turbulence within the party continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very hard to know what they are doing," said Jiri Dienstbier, a 
prominent dissident and journalist, "but it is obvious there is confusion and 
consternation. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, they have nothing to do -- they have come to the limits of their 
possibilities. Now they have Havel in jail for nearly one month. If they go 
ahead with a trial, they can be sure there will be more demonstrations. And if 
he continues to be in jail, it will bring a continuing flood of petitions and 
protests, and it may win for Havel the Nobel Prize -- he has been mentioned as 
a serious candidate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Preposterous' 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are lost, bankrupt," says Martin Palous, who was arrested a day 
after Havel and has been charged with hooliganism. "It's preposterous. They 
charged Havel with incitement because he lays flowers in the street! What they 
are doing has nothing in common with reality. It is the style of the 1950s. 
They speak about more democracy and openness, but they do not accept the 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The spectacle of police arrayed in massive numbers around Wenceslas Square for 
seven days in a row shocked many Prague residents, who had assumed that such 
pointed displays of state force had passed out of favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand it," said a woman who works as a cashier in a shop on the 
square. "There was no necessity for the police, for their water hoses and the 
dogs. People were completely peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
A petition has circulated among Prague's leading movie and television actors, 
protesting Havel's arrest. The petition has continued to gather the signatures 
of Czechoslovakia's performers, writers and intellectuals, significantly 
including those who have not been active before in dissident circles. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important than the public reaction was the dismay felt by some 
government bureaucrats and middle-level officials, who told some Czechoslovak 
friends that the police action was uncalled for and that the government had 
made a tactical error in arresting Havel. 
</P>
<P>
The government could have backed down by releasing Havel after a 48-hour 
detention period -- a measure frequently employed against dissidents here -- 
but its decision to hold onto him is viewed by diplomats as a sign of serious 
disarray in the party. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to decide soon which why they are going to move," said an East 
European diplomat. "Jakes will always follow Moscow -- but what does Moscow 
want? He'll always be a loyal party man -- but what does the party want? These 
things are no longer so clear to the Czech leadership, and they are going to 
have to be sorted out soon." 
</P>
<P>
A Central Committee meeting of the party in March may be pivotal for the 
leadership as it tries to find the answers to those questions and apportion the 
blame for the trouble brought by Havel's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no idea which way it is going to go," fellow dissident Palous said. 
"You think they have to change, but it is not sure. I have been caught up in 
this machinery. It is like a blind force going forward, and it is hard to stop 
it when it gets moving."

HUNGARY BACKS MULTI-PARTY SYSTEM; NO RULING YET ON '56 REVOLT

<P>
Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz said Saturday that the party's leadership 
has endorsed a multi-party system but will continue to reassess a key chapter 
in Hungary's history -- the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee, split between hard-liners and reformers, ended a special 
two-day session aimed primarily at assessing the emotionally and politically 
significant revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, who has said previously that a multi-party system in Hungary is likely 
next year, told Hungarian Radio that "the party has taken a stand that it 
accepts, takes note of and endorses a multi-party system." 
</P>
<P>
But the length and secrecy of the meeting indicated that the party was split 
over plans to share power with other parties, as well as over a host of other 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of the alternative political movements founded in recent months 
announced Monday that they will not enter a coalition government with the 
Communists, as some Communist Party reformers desire, unless the party revises 
its view of 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, party spokesman Emil Kimmel told Hungarian Radio that the "various 
platforms" within the 108-member Central Committee "sought unity on the 
fundamental issues," indicating a split. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee meeting was called after Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay 
shocked Hungarians in January by terming the 1956 revolt a "popular uprising." 
It had been referred to for more than three decades as a counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt began Oct. 23, 1956, with demands that Soviet troops leave Hungary. 
About 20,000 Soviet troops entered Budapest to quell the uprising on Nov. 4 and 
replaced the government. 
</P>
<P>
When he referred to the revolt as a popular uprising on Jan. 28, Pozsgay said 
his reassessment was based on the report of a party commission investigating 
four decades of communist rule in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The report has not been published, but Grosz said it will be. He also said 
Pozsgay's comments were "too hasty."

S. AFRICA DISPUTES VATICAN STUDY ON APARTHEID

<P>
The government said Saturday that a Vatican report condemning apartheid 
misrepresents South Africa's racial policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department, in a statement, said it had not received a copy 
of the 45-page Vatican document released earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of what is known to us, (the document) misrepresents South 
African government policy, clearly restated by the newly elected leader of the 
governing party in his first parliamentary statement," the statement said, 
referring to Education Minister F. W. de Klerk, recently elected to replace 
ailing President Pieter W. Botha as leader of the National Party. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech Wednesday, De Klerk called for an end to white-minority domination 
and racial prejudice, although he reaffirmed the government's commitment to 
segregation and made no mention of establishing black voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican document called apartheid "institutionalized racism . . . justified 
by an ideology of the superiority of persons from European stock over those of 
African or Indian origin." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government banned all protest meetings intended to show 
solidarity with an estimated 300 black detainees waging a hunger strike to 
protest being held without charge. The order by Gen. Hendrik de Witt, 
commissioner of police, specifically banned a meeting in Johannesburg by 
lawyers from three anti-apartheid groups -- the National Assn. of Democratic 
Lawyers, Lawyers for Human Rights and the Black Lawyers Assn.

PARAGUAY'S EL TIGRE: RODRIGUEZ PROVES WILY IN THE WAYS OF POWER 
</P>

ASUNCION, Paraguay 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through much of the long night of combat that finally drove him from power, 
President Alfredo Stroessner apparently believed that his second in command, 
Gen. Andres Rodriguez, was also under siege by the rebel troops. 
</P>
<P>
Only just before he surrendered did Stroessner at last accept that he was 
undone not by junior officers but by Rodriguez himself, according to one 
officer's account. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the coup leader had proved his loyalty to Stroessner over a period of 
years and had been well rewarded for doing so, becoming one of Paraguay's 
richest men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Was Unlikely Coup Target 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner, who had been considered among the least likely coup targets in 
Latin America, is suddenly in exile in Brazil. Rodriguez, whose affable, 
gentlemanly manner belies a wily grasp of the ways of power, demonstrated why 
his soldiers call him el tigre, the tiger. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was sworn in as provisional president a few hours after the shooting 
stopped on Feb. 3 and has since made a series of bold promises in a country 
ruled by military strongmen much of the time since its independence from Spain 
in 1811. His pledges include multiparty democracy, human rights and the rule of 
law. So far, he has earned considerable civilian and foreign good will. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old general, 11 years younger than Stroessner, comes to power in a 
world far different from that of Stroessner's after his 1954 coup. Paraguay is 
now surrounded by democratically ruled neighbors urging Rodriguez to make 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, more worried in the 1950s about finding anti-communist 
allies, now says it seeks to entrench democracy as a bulwark against communism. 
Moreover, Washington is obsessed with the narcotics trade and is well aware of 
news reports linking Rodriguez to drugs moving through Paraguay. Rodriguez 
calls the reports lies planted by his enemies to ruin him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented Challenge 
</P>
<P>
The provisional president has set himself an unprecedented challenge for a 
Paraguayan ruler: to draw the opposition into a newly democratic system, giving 
the government legitimacy at home and abroad without losing the loyalty of his 
-- and Stroessner's -- two pillars of support, the powerful Colorado Party and 
the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Most Paraguayans have found it hard not to conclude that Rodriguez seized power 
because his own position was threatened. Stroessner had been maneuvering to 
place his son, air force Col. Gustavo Stroessner, in line to succeed him as 
armed forces commander -- and perhaps president as well. Rodriguez, commander 
of the 1st Army Corps in the capital region, is thought to have counterattacked 
when Stroessner tried to push him into a ceremonial position. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the coup would not have succeeded if the political environment had not been 
changing, knowledgeable Paraguayans and diplomats agree. 
</P>
<P>
Stroessner had expanded the reach of the 110-year-old Colorado Party into every 
village, trade union and school, while banning the main opposition force, the 
Liberals. He elevated supporters to key military posts, making it unlikely that 
either the party or the military would revolt. Stroessner realized that the way 
to preserve power was to keep each group wary of -- and dependent on -- the 
other, to prevent a repeat of the bloody Paraguayan civil war of 1947. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Began to Erode 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Stroessner's party support began to erode when his most 
fanatical supporters seized the party leadership and ousted the 
Traditionalists, who opposed a dynastic, corrupt order. Some of the most 
venerable party figures, such as elderly Chairman Juan Ramon Chaves and Supreme 
Court Justice Luis Maria Argana, were driven into the political wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez judged that these disaffected forces would welcome him if he turned 
on Stroessner, and Argana acknowledged Tuesday that he and Rodriguez had spoken 
before the coup. 
</P>
<P>
One of Rodriguez's first moves as provisional president was a call to restore 
unity and integrity in the Colorado Party. In the first days, Stroessner's 
backers were purged from party posts. Chaves was renamed to the party 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he would be willing to serve as president if the party wanted 
him, and Colorado supporters quickly endorsed his candidacy in an election 
hurriedly scheduled for May 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ended Ban on Opposition Party 
</P>
<P>
He agreed to allow all parties to compete -- ending Stroessner's ban on the 
Liberals -- the other significant political force for more than a century -- 
and smaller groups. But he has stood firm on the election date despite 
opposition complaints that reorganizing would be impossible in such a short 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Saguier, a leader of the Liberals, said he suspects that Rodriguez will 
adopt some of the trappings of democracy, in the hope of ending Paraguay's 
pariah status, but will not permit any real competition. 
</P>
<P>
"They are going to change what they have to change to make sure that things 
stay the same," Saguier said. 
</P>
<P>
It took a week for Rodriguez to win recognition from the United States, and it 
came with this statement from U.S. Ambassador Timothy L. Towell: "Words are not 
enough. . . . Their credibility will be based on following through on what they 
say they are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Tough Character' 
</P>
<P>
A foreign diplomat said of Rodriguez: "Here is a guy who has been with 
Stroessner since Day 1 and is a tough character. Why would anyone believe that 
he is going to be the flower of democracy in Paraguay? There is no reason to 
believe that this is an instant democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Others wondered whether Rodriguez might have recognized that the system had 
become bloated, outdated and stagnant, keeping Paraguay among the poorest 
countries on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Rodriguez has set a different tone. Receiving reporters in the 
presidential palace, Rodriguez expressed his support for democracy and human 
rights and free expression. He indicated that closed newspapers and radio 
stations would be allowed to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to criticize Stroessner or discuss the coup itself, except to 
assert that no more than 50 people were killed or wounded, denying diplomatic 
sources' reports of about 300 dead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Series of Promotions 
</P>
<P>
Criticizing Stroessner would have been disingenuous. Rodriguez aligned with 
Stroessner early on and stayed by his side. When there was an internal coup 
attempt in 1955, Rodriguez, then a captain, played a key role in thwarting it 
-- along with Argana, who was also an army captain and head of the presidential 
military staff. This brought the first of a series of promotions for Rodriguez, 
a cavalry officer said to be respected by his troops for his fairness and lack 
of ostentation, despite his wealth. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure that no pro-Stroessner army forces challenge him, Rodriguez has 
carried out a thorough military reorganization. He has appointed Gen. Ramon 
Humberto Garcete, an infantry division commander who was the first to declare 
his support for the coup, to Rodriguez's former job as commander of the 1st 
Army Corps. Col. Lino Cesar Oviedo Silva, who led the combat troops in the 
coup, has been named commander of the 1st Cavalry Division. 
</P>
<P>
If Paraguayan tradition holds, these men will enjoy not only more power but 
more privilege as well. Stroessner offered key business posts to loyal 
officers, such as presidencies of state-owned companies, and is said to have 
parceled out the rights to Paraguay's No. 1 industry, contraband. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez is described as an excellent businessman, with vast cattle ranches, 
currency exchange houses that a diplomat estimates bring in $20,000 to $30,000 
a day, and an import company the diplomat says would be a perfect channel for 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unsubstantiated Reports 
</P>
<P>
But nothing has emerged so far to substantiate reports that Rodriguez has ties 
to drug trafficking. These reports first appeared in the early 1970s, at the 
time of a conflict over a U.S. request for the extradition of Auguste Ricord, 
an expatriate Frenchman later convicted of being part of the Marseilles heroin 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
According to Paul H. Lewis' 1980 book, "Paraguay Under Stroessner," Rodriguez 
had made available to Ricord airstrips on his ranches for smuggling drugs and 
had sought to block his extradition. Rodriguez made a point of denying any 
involvement, past or present, with anyone linked to drug dealing. He has not 
spoken publicly on the Ricord case, or about a subsequent report linking him to 
the shipment of chemicals used to refine coca leaves into cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Importing goods and smuggling them into neighboring countries is a tradition in 
Paraguay. It accounts for more than half the country's income. After-hours 
business by senior military officers is also accepted. 
</P>
<P>
In a country of 3.1 million with a small, sleepy capital, there are few 
secrets. Everyone seems to be related to someone in power. Stroessner was known 
to keep a mistress. Rodriguez, by contrast, has maintained a flawless family 
image and is seen frequently with his wife, Nelida. One of his three daughters, 
Marta, is married to one of Stroessner's sons, Alfredo, a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rumors Grew Strong Feb. 2 
</P>
<P>
Paraguayans guess that planning for the coup began no more than 10 days 
beforehand. Rodriguez reportedly sent a note to his daughter and son-in-law to 
extend their vacation in Uruguay for a few more days. Rumors grew strong on 
Feb. 2 that something was afoot, yet many citizens believed that the first 
sounds of gunfire were fireworks celebrating the San Blas national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
With the strength of the 1st Army Corps behind him, Rodriguez had numerical 
superiority when his men burst out of corps headquarters near the airport at 
9:45 p.m. Support quickly galvanized in the air force and navy, which joined 
him after minor skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
It took more than six hours of machine gun and artillery fire before Stroessner 
gave in and was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Asked three days later how it felt to have overthrown his in-law, Rodriguez 
smiled, looked down for a moment and said, "I wouldn't say 'overthrown.' I 
consider it to have been defending a fine and just cause."

GUERRILLA ATTACKS THREATEN DIALOGUE, BAKER TELLS PLO 
</P>

Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturday that the United States has 
decided to continue its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization but 
that Washington has warned the PLO that guerrilla attacks against Israeli 
targets could change that stance. 
</P>
<P>
"These are actions that present us with great difficulty," Baker said, 
referring to an apparent attempt by five PLO guerrillas to infiltrate Israel 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not prepared at this time to say that this constitutes action by the 
PLO that would cause us to break off the dialogue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But in a message delivered to the PLO by the U.S. envoy in Tunisia last week, 
he said, "We made the point that actions such as this, directed at military or 
civilian targets inside or outside Israel, were something that gave us 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The five guerrillas, four Palestinians and one Lebanese, were intercepted and 
killed by Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, a few miles from Israel's 
northern border. Israeli officials said the guerrillas carried documents 
showing that they were associated with two factions of the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem government also charged that the guerrillas intended to attack a 
target inside Israel, partly because they carried grenades and wire-cutters -- 
presumably for breaching the security fence along the border. 
</P>
<P>
When the Reagan Administration opened official diplomatic contacts with the PLO 
in December, it did so on condition that the organization renounce terrorism 
and recognize Israel's right to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after the guerrillas were intercepted, Israel formally demanded that 
the Bush Administration break off its relations with the PLO on the grounds 
that the Palestinians had violated its terms by attempting an act of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Baker carefully sidestepped the question of whether the guerrillas' presence in 
the Israeli-controlled sector of southern Lebanon constituted terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
But he also made explicit a new, broad definition of the kind of operations 
that would put the U.S.-PLO dialogue in danger: not only attacks against 
civilians inside Israel, but raids against Israeli military units inside 
Lebanon as well.

Kuwait's government revealed Saturday that it had freed two of the 17 convicted 
terrorists whose liberty has been sought by pro-Iranian extremists holding 
Western hostages in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Salim Sabah said the two men, Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas, 25, 
and Nasser Matar Dahash, 30, were released "a while ago" after they completed 
five-year prison terms for their parts in the December, 1983, bombings of the 
American and French embassies in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Sabah said the release of the men, who were deported to undisclosed 
destinations, "has nothing to do with the demands of extremist organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Abbas was identified as an Iraqi national, and Dahash as a Kuwaiti. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Westerners, including nine Americans, are being held hostage in 
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East 
correspondent for the Associated Press. He and Thomas Sutherland, 57, acting 
dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut, were kidnaped by 
Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian extremist group that has frequently demanded the 
release of the Kuwait 17.

British Airways on Saturday gave its fleet of supersonic Concorde jets a clean 
bill of health after safety checks following the discovery of small cracks in 
the roof structure of one plane. 
</P>
<P>
The airline made what it called precautionary checks on five Concordes that had 
made more than 3,500 landings. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways said no cracks were found in the ultrasonic checks on the 
planes' upper fuselage. These checks will be repeated after every 100 flights 
until the parts are replaced, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
The cracks in the roof of one Concorde were discovered during maintenance work, 
British Airways said. Similar checks are being carried out on Air France 
Concordes.

Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed 1989-90 state budget would virtually 
eliminate a new program to combat crimes generated by bigotry -- a program that 
the Republican governor publicly praised just last month. Steven Owyang, 
executive and legal affairs secretary of the Fair Employment and Housing 
Commission, said the pioneer program, including films showing the public how to 
use a little-known state law against so-called "hate crimes," could be a 
casualty of a $204,000 commission cutback proposed by Deukmejian. On Jan. 24, 
Deukmejian had praised the commission on its 30th anniversary and cited its 
efforts to increase public awareness of the Ralph Civil Rights Act and its 
provisions. An Adminstration spokesman expressed surprise at the possible 
budget effects on the commission's operation.

Virtually the entire nation reported temperatures above zero as the February 
cold snap eased slightly. It remained abnormally cold in northern Florida, 
where temperatures fell to 24 degrees at Tallahassee and 29 at Jacksonville and 
Gainesville, but Miami reported a high of 79. In North Carolina, the mercury 
sank to 21 at Cape Hatteras, tying a record set on the date in 1899. Light snow 
was widely scattered with little significant accumulation. Snow showers and 
squalls spread flakes over northern New York state, northern Maine and 
Michigan. Snow also was scattered from eastern Idaho across Utah and western 
Colorado. The heaviest snowfall was one inch at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.

A Greyhound bus was destroyed by fire on U.S. 101 in the Atascadero area, but 
all 18 passengers and the driver escaped uninjured, the California Highway 
Patrol said. Officers said the driver, Joanne Huggins, 36, stopped the bus when 
a light indicated dangerously low pressure in the braking system. About 10 
minutes later, the rear tires blew and the bus caught fire. The officers said 
Huggins evacuated the bus before the flames engulfed the vehicle. The cause of 
the fire was not immediately determined.

Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis tweaked President Bush by accusing him of 
apparently failing to include cleanup funds for Boston Harbor in his budget 
message. Recalling the sometimes nasty presidential election, during which he 
was Bush's opponent, Dukakis reminded his audience at a reception that Bush had 
made an issue of Boston Harbor in the campaign by accusing Dukakis of being 
unable to clean up the polluted waters. "Without being parochial, I want you 
all to know that there is no money for the Boston Harbor cleanup, zero," 
Dukakis said.

Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said he is a "bigger optimist" than ever 
following a week of historic talks with the Polish government, but strikes in 
three Polish cities threatened to disrupt the negotiations. The latest wave of 
strikes was triggered by new price increases for consumer goods, but Solidarity 
officials accused Communist-led unions of exploiting labor unrest in an attempt 
to derail the talks that began Monday in Warsaw. Walesa said there were no 
concrete results but added that he is encouraged by the discussions. "I was 
always an optimist, but now I am a biggger optimist," Walesa said after a 
meeting with Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, in Warsaw for a visit.

Federal authorities should expand their tough new anti-terrorism measures to 
cover foreign air carriers with landing rights in the United States, said the 
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), in a 
letter to Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, said he was "dismayed" 
that emergency security precautions taken after the holiday bombing of Pan Am 
Flight 103 over Scotland, which claimed 270 lives, apply only to domestic 
carriers with international flights. "I do not think it requires a quantum leap 
in logic to conclude that as it becomes more difficult to penetrate the 
security of U.S. flag carriers because of their superior security systems, the 
terrorist threat may well shift to foreign air carriers. . . . " Bentsen said. 
About half of Americans traveling abroad fly on foreign carriers, he said. Last 
December, the Federal Aviation Administration announced tightened security 
procedures by U.S. air carriers at 103 airports in the Middle East and Western 
Europe.

West German automobile giant Daimler-Benz sold trucks to the military in 
Pakistan without proper export permits, the news magazine Der Spiegel reported. 
A spokesman for Daimler-Benz, Friedrich Loesch, denied that export rules were 
broken, saying the trucks were "multi-use vehicles" not specifically designed 
for military purposes. However, he conceded that the trucks could be used by 
the Pakistan military. Der Spiegel said that Daimler-Benz, based in Stuttgart, 
sold Pakistan 237 trucks and 30 tractor-trailers from November, 1986, through 
November, 1987. It also said that the shipments were not inspected by customs 
officials because they were registered as civilian vehicles. Export permits are 
required for the shipment of military equipment or hazardous materials to areas 
of tension.

CONQUERING FEAR OF FLYING -- BY THE BOOK

After more than three years of being grounded by dread, a nervous but 
determined Phil DeHart boarded a plane a few days before Christmas so he could 
spend the holiday with relatives in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
He wouldn't have been able to get on that jet, he says, if it weren't for a new 
book designed to ease fearful fliers' fears. 
</P>
<P>
"The book tells you, 'The more you understand something, the less you fear it.' 
I think that's one of the things that helped me," the 35-year-old painting 
contractor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Fly Without Fear," a 172-page psychology paperback written by the directors of 
USAir's Fearful Flyers Program, is helping countless others cope with 
aerophobia, or just plain apprehension. Studies show that 1 in 6 Americans is 
afraid to fly, making it one of the two or three things people fear most. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the next best thing to the class that we do," said Capt. Frank Petee, a 
former pilot who is director of special projects for USAir. 
</P>
<P>
Petee and Carol Stauffer, a clinical social worker, based "Fly Without Fear" on 
the seven-week program they launched here in 1975. Some 3,000 people have taken 
the course, and 97% of them report success. 
</P>
<P>
The course is offered in only 10 U.S. cities a year so "when we get a call from 
someone in Minnesota and they're desperate like these people are, there's 
nothing to offer them," Stauffer said. "Now they have a book." 
</P>
<P>
One person helped by the course was Patricia Hass, an editor at Dodd, Mead 
&amp; Co., who asked them to write the book. Dodd, Mead released it in November 
but Petee and Stauffer have taken over distribution from the liquidating 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Like the program, "Fly Without Fear" describes the mechanics of flying and the 
reason for turbulence. It also discusses the four main fears of flying: 
acrophobia, or fear of heights; claustrophobia, or fear of closed spaces; fear 
of crashing or dying, and fear of not being in control. It suggests relaxation 
techniques and other methods to overcome them. 
</P>
<P>
The book also emphasizes air safety. An average 18,000 commercial flights carry 
1 million people daily in the United States, generally without incident, 
Stauffer said. "It's by far the safest way one can travel." 
</P>
<P>
Knowing the odds as well as something about the process of flying comforted 
DeHart during a week that unnerved even the most fearless fliers. 
</P>
<P>
After twice poring over "Fly Without Fear," DeHart flew Dec. 21 from his home 
in Phoenix to Indianapolis. That was a few hours before a bomb aboard Pan 
American World Airways Flight 103 exploded in the sky over Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
He returned Dec. 26 -- the day an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 was forced to 
land in Charleston, W.Va., with a 14-inch hole torn in its fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
That is bad timing for anyone but especially for someone whose fear stemmed 
from the misfortune of being at airports within a few hours or days of crashes. 
</P>
<P>
DeHart passed through Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport on Aug. 3, 1985, a 
day after a Delta Air Lines jumbo jet crashed, killing 137 people. "I could see 
all the wreckage out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a vow to myself I wasn't going to get on another airplane." 
</P>
<P>
Accidents tend to push "borderline" fearful fliers over the edge, said 
Stauffer. "It's just so awesome to think about. If you already have some fear 
inside you, brewing there, something like that is enough to set it off." 
</P>
<P>
Petee acknowledges that his job undoubtedly will be "tougher from here on in" 
because of the Pan Am bombing and recent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite often, you have to revert back to the fact that these things happening 
like this are so far and few between. They really are," he said. "When you go 
back 25 to 30 years, only 2% of accidents were caused by maintenance-related 
incidents. Only 2%."

NATIONAL PRIDE AND SENSE OF IDENTITY SEEN EMERGING IN CANADA

<P>
Painfully slowly at times, a strong sense of national pride and identity seems 
to be emerging in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian native Kate Nelligan recently appeared on stage here en route to a 
bravura performance on Broadway in "Spoils of War." 
</P>
<P>
The actress was making her first professional appearance in Canada after 
triumphs elsewhere, but she professed surprise that anyone would find that 
quirky fact about her career interesting or relevant. 
</P>
<P>
When a new owner purchased the Toronto Argonauts of the ailing Canadian 
Football League, the local speculation was rampant that he was interested not 
in the club but in the lease for the city's spectacular new Skydome to bring in 
a National Football League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
The sale terms finally were produced to show that he would not have any such 
rights to the stadium even if the Argonauts folded. 
</P>
<P>
Canada has its complexes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talk of a New Canada 
</P>
<P>
When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney emerged in his hometown of Baie-Comeau, 
Quebec, for a resounding victory celebration after the Nov. 21 election, he 
spoke of a new Canada that was proud of its abilities and ready to compete 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, this is what Canadian media expert Marshall McLuhan, who died in 
1980, wrote to then-Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in 1968: 
</P>
<P>
"Canada is the only country in the world that has never had a national 
identity. In an age when all homogeneous nations are losing their identity 
images through rapid technological change, Canada alone can 'keep its cool.' " 
The campaign was fought over such issues of national identity and purpose, 
summed up in the question of whether Canada should go ahead with the free-trade 
agreement with the United States signed by Mulroney and President Reagan in 
January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The election outcome with a second consecutive majority government for 
Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party cleared the way for the trade 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The election brought Canada an unusual amount of attention internationally, 
something of a surprise to most Canadians who routinely say their country is of 
only limited interest to the world. It also served domestically as a rare 
episode of intensive debate and soul-searching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pride in Canada 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the greatest surprise was the pride both camps felt in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
For Mulroney and the pro-free traders, Canada was a land of competence and hard 
work, ready to take on competitors in the United States without the protection 
of tariffs despite being outnumbered nearly 10 to one. 
</P>
<P>
For anti-free traders, Canada was a caring country and unbridled market forces 
-- seen here as being American -- could threaten its traditions of generosity 
and protection for its people. 
</P>
<P>
No line brought greater applause to Liberal Party leader John Turner, who ran a 
fervent campaign against the free trade agreement, than when he roared: "When 
you walk into a Canadian hospital, they don't check your credit card before 
they check your pulse." 
</P>
<P>
A certain smugness could be noted in Canadians running down their list of 
concerns about too much contact with the United States, from the cleanliness of 
Canadian cities and lower crime rates to their belief that government exists to 
take care of and provide services for its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Fear of 'L' Word 
</P>
<P>
The "L" word for liberal that is buried so often in U.S. politics is nothing to 
be feared in Canada. Indeed, the comparable word game played here is to point 
out that the emphasis in Progressive Conservative Party should be on 
progressive. 
</P>
<P>
Although free trade overwhelmed all other issues this fall, one of the major 
controversies expected in the coming months is about the government's role in 
providing child day care. 
</P>
<P>
Writer and popular historian Pierre Berton believes geography and history have 
created a firm identity in Canada and too much has been made of a national 
inferiority complex. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a different kind of people than the Americans," he said in an 
interview, adding that he opposed the free-trade agreement because of its 
potential threat to national identity and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Newman, a senior columnist for the national news weekly Maclean's, said 
the fall election was the most heated race in generations and predicted that 
its impact will linger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Very Precious Thing' 
</P>
<P>
"What we already have is a very precious thing," he said in a phone interview 
from British Columbia. "We like what we have here, and we want to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
The youthfulness of Canadian institutions plays a key role in national 
perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The nation dates to 1867 when its four original provinces joined, but British 
colonial institutions lingered far longer. The maple leaf flag was adopted in 
1964, and the last vestiges of colonial status were eliminated with the passage 
of the Constitution Act of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The conference room at the Ottawa headquarters of Heritage Canada, a national, 
nonprofit organization formed with government support in 1973, is decorated 
with paintings from each of the country's regions. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes are impressive and picturesque, from an ornate courtyard in the city 
of Quebec to a small town in Ontario to homes built during the Gold Rush in the 
Yukon's Dawson City. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us celebrate our diversity," Constance Johnson, the organization's 
spokeswoman, cheerfully told a visitor. "But it sounds more like coping -- at 
the moment we're not quite ready to celebrate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Cultural Mosiac 
</P>
<P>
Canadians like to emphasize that they chose instead of the American-style 
melting pot to retain a cultural mosaic, adding in dozens of immigrant 
societies to the basic English and French differences and their persistent 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
There also is great interest in the vast, sparsely populated northern portions 
of Canada as a contributor to national identity. 
</P>
<P>
"Few have seen the cliffs of Baffin or the eskers of the tundra but we all live 
cheek by jowl with the wilderness; and all of us, I think, feel the empty and 
awesome presence of the North," Berton wrote in his book, "Why We Act like 
Canadians." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the Canadian population of 26 million lives in cities and towns 
stretched from the Atlantic coastal provinces to British Columbia on the 
Pacific, most not more than 200 miles from the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
With or without the free-trade agreement, the $150-billion annual exchange 
between Canada and the United States already is remarkable as the largest 
two-way trading relationship in the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignored by U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Each is the other's No. 1 trading partner, but Canadians complain that they are 
ignored by the United States and expect that to happen again now that the 
uproar over free trade has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Americans will overlook us, as they always do," Newman said. 
"Unless you make some noise, they just take it for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian economic growth, fueled by trade -- mostly with the United States -- 
has lasted and at times boomed during the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says 
growth was 4.25% for 1988, trailing only Japan's 5.75% growth rate among the 
Group of Seven industrial democracies. The forecast was for a decline to 3% 
growth in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The government's Statistics Canada found that Canadians' standard of living was 
90% of that in the United States through much of this decade.

FOES OF U.S.-CANADA TRADE PACT VOW NOT TO SURRENDER

The forces that fought the free-trade agreement with the United States say they 
have no intention of giving up on the issue despite their election loss to 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a continuing trade agenda before us," Tony Clark, director of the 
Pro-Canada Network, said in an interview. "I think it boils down to how much 
more political and economic depending can Canada take on the greatest economic 
power in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition of some 20 national organizations, including church groups, 
environmentalists and women's groups, was formed in 1987 to battle the trade 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Its publicity, especially a comic book outlining the trade issues, was among 
the most visible during the campaign that ended Nov. 21 with a majority 
government for Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
That cleared the way for the trade agreement he signed in January, 1988, with 
President Reagan to proceed, but the opponents plan to keep dramatizing the 
changes they believe it will force on Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready for 'the Long Haul' 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said the activist groups that form the anti-free trade coalition met 
again after the election and pledged to continue "for what we call the long 
haul" of at least the next four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
"There was credible commitment and resolve to continue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest concern during the campaign focused on the impact that the trade 
agreement could have on Canada's more extensive network of health and social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-free traders plan to put the spotlight on any incidents in which they 
believe the government backs away from its pledge that programs won't be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
Also getting attention will be any workers who lose their jobs as a result of 
the trade agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Job Increase Forecast 
</P>
<P>
The supporters of free trade forecast a net increase of as many as 250,000 jobs 
over 10 years, but concede that some plants will be closing as business and 
industry restructures to serve a wider North American market. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the questions about what constitutes government subsidies remain to be 
decided in U.S.-Canadian negotiations over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The battle is not over," Mel Hurtig, publisher of "The Canadian Encyclopedia" 
and a vocal opponent of the agreement, said in a telephone interview from 
Edmonton, Alberta. "We consider that we're bloodied and bruised, but we've only 
lost one major battle in the war." 
</P>
<P>
The majority government that Mulroney won means that there won't be another 
election for about four years, but anti-free traders predict that the issue 
once again will be the dominant one in the next campaign.

HUNGARIAN REFORMER'S VIEW ON 1956 REVOLT APPARENTLY REJECTED

<P>
A Communist Party spokesman indicated Saturday that party leaders have rejected 
a Politburo reformer's reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Emil Kimmel told Hungarian Radio that speakers at a crucial Friday 
session of the 108-member Central Committee said there should be no 
"single-word summary formulations" to reassess the past. 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Imre Pozsgay startled the nation Jan. 28 by saying the 1956 
rebellion against Soviet control was "a popular uprising." Officially, it was 
called a counterrevolution. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting resumed Saturday with the media reporting few specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay said his assessment was based on findings of a Hungarian Communist 
Party commission investigating four decades of Communist rule in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent Central Committee member Gyula Horn, also state secretary at the 
Foreign Ministry, hinted late Friday that Pozsgay's stance was not accepted by 
most members. 
</P>
<P>
Varying only slightly from the official stance, Horn said on television that 
the meeting's "very careful assessment" showed the revolt "started as an 
uprising, some may call it a 'popular uprising,' but later on it turned into 
something which could be termed a counterrevolution." 
</P>
<P>
State media displayed none of their new openness in reporting on Friday's 
closed-door session. It was not known what was said by Pozsgay and other senior 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kimmel, the speakers supported the basic idea expounded in a 
report submitted by Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz, which says "one can 
establish order without a reform, but the reform may not be instituted without 
order." 
</P>
<P>
He also said Grosz called for an action program for the future. Grosz's speech 
has not been published and no other details were disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party spokesman indicated Saturday that party leaders have rejected a 
Politburo reformer's reassessment of the 1956 revolt as a popular uprising.

WAYNE HAYS, A SCOURGE OF CONGRESS, DIES; 
</P>
<P>
LONGTIME LAWMAKER'S CAREER RUINED BY AFFAIR WITH STAFF CLERK

<P>
Former Ohio Rep. Wayne Hays, one of the most hated and feared men in Congress 
whose 28-year career in the House was derailed by an affair with a staff member 
hired to serve only as his mistress, died Friday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
Hays died in the emergency room of Wheeling Hospital about 3 p.m., apparently 
of heart failure, nursing supervisor Linda Crook said. The Wheeling News 
Register said Hays had visited a heart specialist in Columbus, Ohio, on 
Thursday for tests. 
</P>
<P>
Hays, a Democrat, was former chairman of the House Administration Committee, 
the panel that controlled the perquisites on Capitol Hill and could make life 
miserable or pleasant for House members. 
</P>
<P>
Described as "the Archie Bunker of Capitol Hill," Hays took delight in settling 
personal scores with members who crossed him and won little sympathy when his 
career was shattered in 1976 by news that he was having an affair with 
Elizabeth Ray. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, 33 at the time, had been hired as a clerk in Hays' office but actually was 
paid $14,000 a year for two years to serve solely as the congressman's 
mistress. She later admitted, "I can't type. I can't file. I can't even answer 
the phone." 
</P>
<P>
Hays was renominated in a primary election right after the scandal broke, but 
soon afterward took an overdose of sleeping pills and nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
The House Ethics Committee began an investigation into Hays' possible misuse of 
government funds, prompting the congressman to give up his committee 
chairmanship. In September, 1976, he resigned from Congress, and the Ethics 
Committee probe was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Hays had been married just six weeks before the Ray scandal broke. The previous 
year he had divorced his first wife of 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Ray's disclosures followed an incident in which Hays ordered Capitol Police to 
escort her out of his office. She said she had gone to his office to ask why 
she had not been invited to Hays' wedding when the rest of the staff had. 
</P>
<P>
Ray met with reporters for The Washington Post later that same day. "It's not 
that I care so much about (Hays) getting married," she said, "but it looks bad 
that I'm not invited. I was good enough to be his mistress for two years, but 
not good enough to be invited to his wedding." 
</P>
<P>
On May 25, 1976, in a speech to the House, Hays acknowledged the relationship 
with Ray, and added, "I hope that when the time comes to leave this House, 
which I love, Wayne Hays may be remembered as mean, arrogant, cantankerous and 
tough, but I hope Wayne Hays will never be thought of as dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
Hays later accused the news media, particularly the Post, of blowing the Ray 
affair out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Hays, born May 13, 1911, returned to his 160-acre cattle and horse farm near 
Belmont, near the Ohio River. Living with his new wife, Pat, he served on the 
board of the Citizens National Bank in nearby St. Clairsville. 
</P>
<P>
Though he left politics for a while, politics never left him. He threatened to 
run for Congress again. He threatened to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to do some good for people, but you call the bureaucrats up and they 
don't pay any attention if you don't hold an office," Hays said. But he said 
people persisted in calling him up for favors, thinking he was still their 
congressman. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if I'm going to do all these things, I might as well hold an 
office," Hays later recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978 Hays ran for the Ohio House, where he had already served in the 1940s 
on his way to Washington. He won the 99th District seat at age 67 and returned 
to Columbus, mainly as a curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
During his two-year term, Hays was a model of exemplary behavior. He shunned 
the nightlife and kept an apartment with his wife. He helped write energy and 
consumer legislation, and battled electric utilities, which he accused of 
"ripping us off." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, Hays spent the floor session reading the daily newspaper. 
Every once in a while, he would explode with an acerbic floor speech littered 
with references to Washington and the past. 
</P>
<P>
He held young lawmakers spellbound with political yarns and was carefully 
observed for signs of a budding power grab. But Hays apparently was content to 
have committee input and respond to his constituents' requests, which were 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
"I've dealt with bureaucrats in Washington and I've dealt with bureaucrats in 
Columbus, and, believe me, there's not a damn bit of difference between them," 
he once said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Hays demonstrated that he had not learned all the political lessons. 
Bidding for reelection, he was caught napping by Robert W. Ney, a 26-year-old 
Republican public safety director from Bellaire, who defeated him the by 500 
votes the next November. 
</P>
<P>
"When I realized it was going to be close, it was too late," a dejected Hays 
said.

WHERE'S THE BEEF?;

<P>
FELINES FIND FAULT WITH SOVIET SAUSAGES

Angry meatpackers are suing a newspaper for an article that said their sausage 
was so bad that even cats can't stomach it, but editors said they turned to a 
furry, four-legged jury that proved their point. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-four sausage experts don't eat it at all; five only eat high quality 
sausage or out of extreme hunger. Only one, the 2-month-old kitten Mura, you 
can say actually sits down to the sausage," the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta 
said in announcing the feline findings. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute started with the literary weekly's story on June 15 titled "The Cat 
Doesn't Know . . ." and was brought up recently in the Dzerzhinsky regional 
people's court. 
</P>
<P>
In a complaint signed by Yu. M. Luzhkov, chairman of the Moscow agroindustrial 
complex, officials demanded a retraction of the newspaper's report that 
producers were breaking the law by putting protein additives in the sausage, 
known in Russian as kolbasa. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a shortage of meat in many Soviet stores, finding good quality 
sausage has become a fixation for many people. A cartoon in an October edition 
of the satire magazine Krokodil showed a line of shoppers standing outside a 
theater, not to buy tickets, but to buy the sausage for sale in the theater's 
buffet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Aggressive Reporting 
</P>
<P>
The case also shows that the more aggressive style of reporting by the Soviet 
press under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's encouragement of greater openness 
is likely to get it into occasional legal trouble. The Tass news agency said 
recently that a court had dismissed a lawsuit against a film producer by a 
biochemical plant near Leningrad that objected to his documentary about 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Literaturnaya Gazeta reported about its dispute with the sausage manufacturers 
in an article titled, "May the Cats Judge Us." It gave no indication that the 
case had gone any further than the initial complaint. 
</P>
<P>
It said that using the permission of state quality control officials to add 
protein additives, the factories were grinding up the skin and bones of cattle 
and throwing them into the sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Animal blood, protein paste, blood plasma, starch, flour, and emulsions of 
protein and fat also were part of the gray, unappetizing mixtures churned out 
by the factories, Literaturnaya Gazeta said. 
</P>
<P>
"Blocks of frozen meat weren't unfrozen or washed before being chopped, and 
were happily thrown in with knots of wool and even the trademarks of the 
factories that produced these blocks. Nails, sand and glass have fallen into 
the sausage," it said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fauna Cat Lovers' Club 
</P>
<P>
To judge the validity of its first story, the newspaper said it sought out the 
Fauna Cat Lovers' Club in the Dzerzhinsky region, where it is being sued. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Berenshtein fed some sausage to Kuzya, his 2 1/2-year-old cat, "but Kuzya 
didn't find any joy in it. Just the opposite, he gave a look like a person 
saying, 'What's that for? What did I do that was so bad, master?' " 
</P>
<P>
It said another cat, Gavrila, tests the sausage for the whole family of Maria 
Klyueva. If Gavrila eats it, the whole family will. If she turns up her nose, 
so does the family. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, out of 30 cats, only Mura the kitten eats the sausage regularly, 
Literaturnaya Gazeta said. 
</P>
<P>
"All kitties, like Mura, must loyally love sausage! That's the way it always 
has been since man thought up sausage. But why, the devil take them, won't they 
eat it?" the newspaper asked. "And why do we continue to eat it?"

TEXAN HELPS INJURED WORKERS;

<P>
LAWYER IS 'KING OF ASBESTOS LITIGATION'

Medical records stuffed in boxes, in file cabinets and piled on the floor make 
the asbestos unit of Walter Umphrey's law firm look more like a doctor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
But the extensive filing system is vital to Umphrey, who has represented more 
than 4,500 people in lawsuits alleging that they were exposed to asbestos on 
their jobs and suffered subsequent shortness of breath and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey, 52, has earned a reputation as the "king of asbestos litigation" in 
the United States. In the process, he has won hundreds of thousands of dollars 
for victims and earned more than $100 million for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have any kind of a claim that has any kind of legitimacy to it, he will 
dedicate all of his manpower and resources behind it to the conclusion, either 
right or wrong," says Ken Bailey, an asbestos expert in Umphrey's firm, 
Umphrey, Swearingen and Eddings. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey's law practice in southeast Texas near Beaumont is deep in the heart of 
one of the nation's foremost manufacturing areas. The so-called Golden Triangle 
area is peppered with oil refineries and chemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey entered asbestos litigation in 1974 when one of his law partner's 
relatives was diagnosed as having asbestosis, a respiratory disease caused by 
exposure to asbestos dust or fibers. Umphrey was already a successful personal 
injury lawyer who represented many local union employees. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the next six months working on nothing but asbestos. He says his team 
of 17 attorneys is so expert that it can file dozens of asbestos cases at the 
same time. The asbestos cases have become the "bread and butter" of his law 
firm, he says. 
</P>
<P>
In Borel vs. Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. in 1973, the federal court opened 
the way for asbestos litigation. That decision questioned whether the dangers 
of asbestos were foreseeable to the manufacturer. It was left to the jury to 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey's business has snowballed. His name and law practice are familiar to 
workers at every refinery in the area. A person must only fill out a medical 
form in Umphrey's law office to be referred to a doctor for screening. 
</P>
<P>
If an asbestos problem exists, the person is referred to a pulmonary specialist 
who performs more tests. If the specialist finds a lung problem from asbestos, 
Umphrey takes the case. 
</P>
<P>
When Umphrey takes an asbestos case, he never loses. Most of his clients 
settle, but the ones who have gone to court have always won jury awards. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey and Wayne Reaud, a Beaumont asbestos attorney who also has never lost a 
case, have joined in a class-action asbestos suit before U.S. District Judge 
Robert Parker beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-day trial of a 1986 Umphrey class-action suit, Jenkins vs. Raymark 
Industries Inc., turned into a model for nationwide asbestos litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey represented 741 insulators, pipe fitters and housewives in the Jenkins 
class-action suit and has filed about 1,300 suits since the $130-million 
Jenkins settlement. The most any one plaintiff won in the Jenkins suit was 
$800,000. 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey says the asbestos companies deserve everything coming to them. 
</P>
<P>
"The nature of the disease is progressive," Umphrey says. "It's like being 
pregnant. Once you get it, there's no remedy. There's no medical cure." 
</P>
<P>
Umphrey has received hundreds of letters from people who were helped by his 
lawsuits. Some of his prescribed screenings were actually able to detect cancer 
in its early stages and save the lives of workers. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was not for Walter Umphrey or myself, these people would be dead and 
their widows would not be compensated one red cent," Reaud says.

FARGO, GA., BATTLES TO SAVE SCHOOL THAT HOLDS TOWN TOGETHER

FARGO, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people of this swampside settlement have shunned formal government since 
the days when it was a logging camp, taking their problems and projects instead 
to town meetings at the schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The school has held the town together, but now it appears headed for closure, 
and residents fear that its demise will mean the end of Fargo just when the 
community is on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
The 250 or so residents are taking on the Georgia Department of Education to 
try to keep the state's smallest elementary school open. The odds aren't great, 
but the odds have been bad before and Fargo is still on most maps. 
</P>
<P>
"Fargo is a can-do town, it's the way towns used to be," said Bill Oettmeier, a 
native son. 
</P>
<P>
"It might take an act of Congress to keep our school. And there's not but 58 
students and we know that. But if we lose the school, it won't be our fault," 
said Rosemary Leviton, a school board member. 
</P>
<P>
Fargo lies on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp, just where the Suwannee River 
crawls out of the bog and heads south in no great hurry past Stephen Foster 
State Park. The songwriter who made the river famous, people in Fargo say, 
apparently never laid eyes on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Much to See 
</P>
<P>
Not that there's much to see. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Highway 89 barely slows down through the cluster of modest homes and 
small stores. Unincorporated since it was a logging camp at the turn of the 
century, Fargo has had little to do with governments -- residents often pass 
the hat when the town needs something -- and governments have returned the 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing but pine trees will grow in the sandy, acid soil around the Okefenokee 
where a "hill" is any land with no standing water on it. In a disastrous fire 
33 years ago, tens of thousands of acres of pines burned. But the trees were 
replanted and are becoming marketable. Now there is serious talk of a new mill, 
of more jobs so more people can stay in Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent 33 years trying to come back and the QBE (Quality Basic Education 
law) is hitting this little place in the head just when it's trying to 
recover," said Oettmeier, president of Superior Pine, which leases more than 
200,000 acres of pine around Fargo to Champion Lumber Co. 
</P>
<P>
Under Georgia's Quality Basic Education law, a reform package passed by the 
Legislature in 1985, smaller school districts are being encouraged to 
consolidate isolated schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Fargo school was built in 1952 for several times the current enrollment. 
But as loggers cut the trees the fire missed, people began to dribble out of 
Fargo. Clinch County operates the school, with its six teachers and one 
principal, on the $200,000 a year it gets in state "sparsity grants." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cut in Half 
</P>
<P>
As things stand, that will be cut in half next year and then end. Fargo, the 
state has decided, doesn't qualify for the grants, though for some children who 
live in its outer reaches the round trip to school in Homerville will mean 
nearly 100 miles a day on a bus. 
</P>
<P>
Don Thornhill, director of facilities and transportation for the Georgia Board 
of Education, said that to qualify there must be no way the schools can be 
consolidated. Only a few meet that standard, he said, and consolidation is 
becoming common across rural Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
If the grant stops, it will be up to Clinch County to decide whether to 
consolidate or use local funds to keep the school open. 
</P>
<P>
"That is not really within the realm of possibilities," said county School 
Supt. Tommy Lee. "This is a rural county that is losing jobs and losing people, 
and for us to take over the cost is out of the question." 
</P>
<P>
Clinch County raises less than a quarter of its annual $4.7-million school 
budget locally. It would have to raise local school taxes by some 25% to handle 
the $200,000 annual Fargo costs. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the concern over Fargo's fate is very real, "but the board of 
education's primary function is to educate children, not preserve towns." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is no school, (the lumber company) is going to want to know about it 
now," Oettmeier said. "They're not going to build a $40-million mill where 
nobody wants to work and live." 
</P>
<P>
Town leaders are lobbying state officials to try to keep the funding that will 
let the school remain open, and say they have some support. It may not be 
enough, many in Fargo realize, to save a way of life they cherish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Lock Bikes 
</P>
<P>
At the school, kids don't lock their bikes. If a kid rode down the street on 
somebody else's bike, the whole town would know. On a recent afternoon dogs 
waited outside a classroom for their young owners, and if one poked a nose in 
an open doorway, that was OK. In Fargo, people know whose dog is whose. 
</P>
<P>
Fargo residents say it is this closeness and tranquility that makes them want 
to stay, raise families and pursue values that are endangered elsewhere, even 
if they have to travel 28 miles to the nearest pharmacy and most go to 
Valdosta, 50 miles west, to see a doctor or dentist. 
</P>
<P>
For a time the nearest fire engine was in Homerville, so Fargo residents raised 
the money themselves to refurbish an old, donated engine. They passed the hat 
to air-condition the school and to build a ballpark, complete with lights. 
Homerville teams played night games in Fargo while waiting for a government 
grant to get a lighted park of their own, Oettmeier notes. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ellis, 25, who returned to his hometown to teach kindergarten and first 
grade, said all the town's activities are centered at the school. "The senior 
citizens have their programs here, the first aid and first response groups meet 
here. So do the Boy Scouts and the PTA." 
</P>
<P>
The school hosts the community Christmas program. Gift baskets are distributed 
from the school to the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"It all happens from the school," Ellis said. "If the school closes, the town 
will close."

<P>
In the century since Civil War correspondent George Alfred Townsend collected 
$5,000 in donations to build a five-story monument honoring those who report on 
armed conflict, the job of covering war has changed greatly. 
</P>
<P>
Today's correspondents, writing about battles in places many Americans cannot 
pronounce -- in Central America, the Middle East and elsewhere -- must master 
complex political, religious and economic issues to tell their stories. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the inscription on Townsend's hillside monument here still 
describes their mission -- "to narrate distant wars" -- and many complaints of 
earlier correspondents persist, gripes about censorship and being manipulated 
by some governments that view reporters as propagandists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems of Access 
</P>
<P>
There also are the problems of access, difficult working conditions and the 
news media's relationship with the military. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civil War was complete anarchy as far as the press was concerned. The army 
didn't supply any help at all," said John R. Wilhelm, dean emeritus at Ohio 
University who covered World War II for Reuters and the Chicago Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
"We were highly organized in World War II. We were given the rank of captain 
and we were to be treated as such," he said. "We had organized press camps 
where they supplied us with motor vehicles, gasoline and drivers. We could go 
anywhere we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Their work, however, was not without risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting having lunch in Belgium, and German dive bombers came over and 
blew the hotel apart and killed my best man, who was sitting next to me having 
lunch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating Relationship 
</P>
<P>
The media-military relationship has deteriorated, especially since the Vietnam 
War, Wilhelm said. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas there were front lines in World War II and reporters wrote about 
territorial advances, journalists in Vietnam went into jungles to cover 
fighting on a smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
The United States sought to use the number of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong 
killed as a measure of progress, but correspondents said the counts often were 
exaggerated and conflicted with eyewitness reports. 
</P>
<P>
The military provided some transportation, but reporters in Vietnam often had 
to find their own way to the battlefield. They hired cars from civilians and 
traveled without military escort on dangerous roads. 
</P>
<P>
Americans rallied behind the armed forces in World War II and eagerly read 
Ernie Pyle's folksy columns, which told the story of individual GIs involved in 
an international war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sort Through Facts 
</P>
<P>
U.S. involvement in Vietnam was not uniformly condoned back home, and reporters 
often complained of having to sort through fact and fiction they got from 
military spokesmen who presented a rosy picture of American fighting. 
</P>
<P>
One former Vietnam correspondent, George Esper of the Associated Press, said 
the military's response to factual reporting during the war often was: "Why 
don't you get on the team?" 
</P>
<P>
Donald G. North, who in 1967 won the Overseas Press Club award for his radio 
reports of combat there, said the biggest obstacles to war reporters today are 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's covering a war in Iraq or Iran, or in Israel, governments in the 
wake of Vietnam think it's wise or necessary to muzzle the press," North said. 
"The British did it in the Falkland Islands and we did it in Grenada." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the U.S. military excluded reporters from covering the early hours of 
America's invasion of the Caribbean island of Grenada, where the White House 
said U.S. students at a medical school were threatened by unrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Were on Our Side' 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State George P. Shultz told a group of editors in December, 1983, 
that in World War II, "reporters were involved all along. And on the whole, 
they were on our side." Now, he says, "it seems as though the reporters are 
always against us . . . they're always seeking to report something that's going 
to screw things up." 
</P>
<P>
But former President Jimmy Carter one month later criticized the coverage 
restrictions in Grenada, saying they were "much more repressive in nature, than 
anything I remember in the history of our country." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the U.S. government formed a commission to ease tensions between 
the media, military and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called credibility gap began in the early 1960s. It's become pretty 
well documented that the government of Saigon was not telling the whole story, 
which the press claimed, and it just got worse and worse," said Winant Sidle, a 
retired Army major general who headed the commission. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Pentagon didn't help any because they weren't telling the whole story 
either." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Military Exercises 
</P>
<P>
The Sidle commission recommended that a pool of reporters accompany future 
military operations. Since 1985, the press has gone with the military on eight 
different military exercises, including the Persian Gulf in July, 1987, when 
Kuwaiti tankers flying American flags were escorted through the volatile 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Burke, vice president of industry and public affairs for the American 
Newspaper Publishers Assn., said problems arose in the Persian Gulf when 
journalists had to use military communication systems to send their copy back 
to the States. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a couple incidents in which people on the ships did not want to 
transmit the story as written by the reporter," said Burke, who was chief of 
information at the U.S. military headquarters in Vietnam in the early 1970s. 
"In another instance, they filed a story off a ship and it was held at the 
Pentagon for at least 12 hours before it was released." 
</P>
<P>
Civil War correspondents did not have such problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They could walk back from the front lines," Burke said, "and find a telegraph 
and file it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Civil War Battle 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, for instance, filed this dispatch about Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan 
at the Battle of Five Forks in Virginia: 
</P>
<P>
"Sheridan galloped everywhere, his flushed face all the redder. He galloped 
once straight down the Rebel front, with but a handful of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
"A dozen bullets whistled for him together; one grazed his arm, at which a 
faithful orderly rode. The black pony leaped high in fright, and Sheridan was 
untouched, but the orderly lay dead in the field, and the saddle dashed afar, 
empty."

THE KING TEMPEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can San Diego rise above the divisiveness over the convention center name? Many 
of us question the wisdom of some adults who listen with their ears instead of 
their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
If we are to heed the words of our new President, who espouses "a kinder, 
gentler nation," then it is appropriate for San Diego to take a generous giant 
step and honor Martin Luther King. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Luther King was a "kind" man. He was a "gentle" man. He was not a 
perfect man. People scream that he did nothing for San Diego. He was, is, and 
will be a symbol of non-violence. Is that not enough? Did Washington cross the 
San Diego River? Did Lincoln emancipate anyone in your community? Yet, we honor 
them and rightfully so. 
</P>
<P>
Every weekday it is my privilege to work with high school students in a basic 
skills lab in English. They bring their problems in understanding a symbol in a 
story or struggle with a thesis statement in writing. Together we tackle the 
problems. They learn from me and I learn from them. This small room is a 
microcosm of San Diego. We cross many lines of nationality and race. We live in 
many areas of the city. We are San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the protection of a classroom door we are witnesses to life outside the 
high school campus, warts and all. We are silent, but we are not deaf. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine what it is like for kids to focus on a hero. Imagine the questions that 
arise when other adults attack the hero. How much kinder and gentler if this 
time we adults could set the tone for the new era by endorsing a man like 
Martin Luther King, by naming our convention center for him. Could we think of 
the future generations that will be rewarded with the first step by a kinder, 
gentler San Diego?

A BAD IDEA FOR BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an idea to reduce illegal immigration or drug traffic from Mexico into the 
United States, the proposed ditch at the Otay Mesa border crossing probably 
makes as about much sense as the notoriously ineffective "Tortilla Curtain," a 
chain-link fence erected 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch would not hinder the overwhelming majority of aliens and smugglers 
who travel by foot. It is designed to make it harder for about 3,000 vehicles 
that drive illegally across the border between Otay Mesa and San Ysidro each 
year, and make it easier for U. S. Border Patrol agents to catch those who 
circumvent the ditch. That would reduce drug and alien traffic and help prevent 
accidents caused by reckless smugglers, Border Patrol officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the ditch would succeed in this goal is doubtful. But, even if it did, 
the people in those 3,000 vehicles, up to eight or nine in a car or up to 25 in 
a van, are a tiny percentage of the estimated 1 million people who cross 
illegally each year in the San Diego area. And what's to stop them from 
crossing by foot? As a tool against illegal immigration or drug trafficking, 
the ditch is just one more finger in the dike and not worth jeopardizing 
relations with Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But, as an idea to channel Otay Mesa rain runoff, which threatens to flood 
areas on the Mexican side of the border -- the original reason Mexico suggested 
the ditch -- the ditch probably makes sense. At least, the engineers from the 
International Boundary and Water Commission thought so. 
</P>
<P>
Just how and why the ditch went from being the solution to an international 
drainage problem to being a solution to a smuggling problem is a bit murky. 
That the Mexican government was blind-sided by U. S. officials is fairly clear, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is just one more illustration of the uneasy relations between 
the two countries. It also telegraphs the reaction that the Mexican government 
is likely to have to even more radical proposals by the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, for a sunken concrete wall topped by a fence running along 
25 miles of the border, and the idea by FAIR and Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego), 
to charge a fee for legally crossing the border. 
</P>
<P>
Both proposals are likely to increase friction between the two countries and 
neither does anything to address the root causes of illegal immigration and 
drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the news of the ditch came the same week as an announcement by the 
San Diego Assn. of Governments that it would be exploring the idea of a 
binational airport with Mexico on Otay Mesa as part of its study of alternative 
locations for the overcrowded Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
If the history of the ditch is any indication, something as complex as a 
binational airport -- no matter how logical it might be -- is unlikely to be 
achieved. 
</P>
<P>
With so many issues that need cooperation between the two governments, and the 
promise of better relations suggested by the new presidents of both countries, 
it's a shame that a fairly simple plan to solve a fairly simple drainage 
problem was sidetracked into the diplomatically dangerous arena of immigration 
control. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch should go back to the engineers' drawing boards, and the decision on 
whether to build it should be based on whether it solves the drainage problem.

NOT A GOD-GIVEN RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputy Lonny G. Brewer was killed by a semiautomatic assault rifle, 
and Deputies James Bennetts and Alfred MacKrille were wounded by them. All 
three cases took place in North County in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of San Diego, with its growing problem of gang and drug-dealing 
violence, the statistics are even more stark. Seven people were killed in the 
city with assault weapons in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Violence committed with semiautomatic assault rifles is proliferating in San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
While the Legislature debates whether to ban their sale -- an action long 
overdue -- local officials should take the initiative and prohibit their sale 
and possession, as was done recently in the cities of Compton, Los Angeles and 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council will consider such an ordinance this week. We hope 
the council will act swiftly and not be swayed by pressure from the National 
Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
We would also urge the County Board of Supervisors and the councils of the 
other cities to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Besides making it a little more difficult to obtain these senseless weapons, 
the ordinances would also send a signal to the Legislature and to Congress that 
the majority of people do not buy the preposterous idea that there is a 
God-given right to own military assault weapons.

SHOWDOWN ANTICIPATED OVER FUTURE OF MIRALESTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At an acrimonious school board meeting last week, residents of the east side of 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula accused the board of bad faith in its offer to keep 
open Miraleste High School by converting it to an intermediate school. 
</P>
<P>
The rebuff of the board's offer sets the stage for a showdown between the Palos 
Verdes Unified School District, which has planned to close the school, and a 
parents group known as the East Peninsula Education Council, which wants to 
keep Miraleste open as a high school. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to keep Miraleste open, but as an intermediate school for 350 to 
425 pupils in grades six to eight, was made last month by school board members 
hoping to avoid continued legal and jurisdictional confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
School board officials say that because of declining enrollment, the district 
no longer can afford to operate three high schools on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. Closing one would save money and enable the district to maintain a 
full educational program at the remaining two. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Net $600,000 
</P>
<P>
Converting Miraleste to an intermediate school would save about half as much as 
an outright closure but would nevertheless net the district $600,000 a year, 
according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
In return for keeping Miraleste open as an intermediate school, the board wants 
the parents group to drop a lawsuit over the closure effort. It also wants the 
group to stop attempts to secede from the Palos Verdes school district and form 
a separate school district for the less populous east side. 
</P>
<P>
Crunch points are coming up in both efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The State Board of Education is scheduled to vote on a petition seeking an East 
Peninsula school district at its March 7-8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In the court case, school officials are close to commencing work on an 
environmental impact report sought by the lawsuit. The report, which could cost 
$100,000, was ordered by the judge in the case. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Thursday night, Tom Jankovich, chairman of the parents group, 
praised the school board for agreeing "in principle" that Miraleste could 
continue to function as a school. 
</P>
<P>
But he accused the board of negotiating in bad faith because of discussions it 
has held with Marymount College officials to use a portion of the Miraleste 
facility, which can accommodate 1,300 students, or perhaps to swap college and 
school facilities. Jankovich said the parents group learned of those 
discussions from college officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, we were understandably dismayed at the district's parallel 
and mutually exclusive discussions, which were evidently being carried on 
toward incompatible ends," Jankovich told the board. 
</P>
<P>
"There are those in the community who take a dim view of having sixth graders 
mixing with college students on the same campus." 
</P>
<P>
Board President Jeffrey N. Younggren said he was stunned at the parents group's 
response. "I don't understand how the Marymount issue has anything to do with 
the proposal. It is a red herring," he said. Younggren said school officials 
had openly discussed Marymount's use of the facility before the compromise 
proposal was formulated, as one way to increase school district revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"To have it distorted as a secret maneuver is ridiculous," he said. "What I 
want to hear from EPEC is, are they willing to deal?" 
</P>
<P>
Other board members said they were frustrated because the parents group did not 
express any interest in settling the controversy and instead chose to attack 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
"I resent very much any innuendo that we have negotiated in bad faith or with 
ulterior motives," said board member Joseph Sanford. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the east-side group's concerns about Marymount's 
possible use of the facility could be negotiated satisfactorily.He promised to 
attend a meeting of the group Wednesday evening in the Miraleste school library 
to hear other concerns about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
After the school board meeting, members of the parents group said it would be 
difficult to stop legal proceedings or call off the secession movement. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,600 East Peninsula residents signed petitions seeking secession from 
the Palos Verdes Unified School District.Although the parents group organized 
the signature drive, it does not have the power to retract the petitions, 
according to Bob Lyon, chairman of its legal committee. 
</P>
<P>
Members also are reluctant to make any agreement with the school board that 
cannot be binding on subsequent boards. Lyon said the group's lawyers are 
researching whether an agreement that is part of a court order could have such 
binding power. The attorney for the school board said it could.

'FOLLOW-HOME' BANDITS DRIVE AFFLUENT TO LESSER CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some well-heeled residents are shunning their luxury cars and converting garage 
door openers and car phones into crime-fighting tools in upscale hillside 
neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley -- the prime stalking ground of the 
"follow-home robbers." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for ways to deal with the robbers come up frequently in conversations 
with friends who own Mercedes-Benzes -- the most common element in the 
robberies -- said Sue Kaplan, a secretary at the Encino Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"I got very nervous when I was followed into a real obscure cul de sac" 
recently, said Kaplan, who drives a new BMW. But she stopped, and the other 
vehicle drove on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the normal person is certainly aware of what's out there, and they're 
going to keep their eyes open," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Encino has been the area hardest hit by the robbers, who spot people driving 
expensive cars, follow them home and rob them. Police estimate that the robbers 
have netted nearly $300,000 in cash and jewels, and blame them for three 
shooting incidents in which three people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No One Arrested 
</P>
<P>
There have been no deaths. No suspects have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 31 robberies or attempts since the incidents began in October, 22 have 
been in the Valley -- 12 in Encino and most of the others in the Santa Monica 
Mountains between Sherman Oaks and Woodland Hills. Nine occurred in similar 
neighborhoods in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of a few husbands who have swapped vehicles with their wives and they 
are driving the Corvettes and the Mercedes, and the wives are driving the 
rent-a-wrecks," said Jack Feldman, past president of the Encino Chamber of 
Commerce. "It's at best a difficult situation that has a lot of people on 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Higgins, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's West 
Valley Division, urged drivers with car phones to use them to alert police if 
they suspect they are being followed. 
</P>
<P>
"They could give us a running account . . . of exactly where they are," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who lives near the Corinthian Drive residence in Encino where the woman 
driver of a Mercedes-Benz was robbed Jan. 11 said she avoids driving her 
husband's new BMW 525 and sticks to her 4-year-old BMW 325. 
</P>
<P>
"I drive my own car . . . which is older, rather than attract attention to 
myself," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
She also wears less jewelry, said her husband, a Los Angeles attorney. Both of 
them have become adept at using the electric garage door opener, he said. "We 
don't leave our car. We drive in, hit the button and shut it again." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the woman said, she thinks that she was followed home from a shopping 
trip to Gelson's Market on Ventura Boulevard last week by a car carrying two 
men. She drove past her home and farther into the hills; eventually the men 
dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watching for Suspects 
</P>
<P>
A Gelson's spokesman said none of the incidents started at the store but added 
that the store's security personnel are aware of the robberies and are watching 
for anyone matching descriptions of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they know of no relationship between the robberies and driving from 
a particular location. 
</P>
<P>
A Tarzana hills executive who drives a Mercedes 560 and whose wife drives a 
Mercedes 420 said they both were being careful when returning home. "We are 
being very aware of vehicles parked on the street that we normally don't see," 
he said. "If that happens, we'll report the vehicle to the police." 
</P>
<P>
But Sandra Leiman of Encino, who drives a Mercedes, said she is unwilling to 
give in to the fears that the robberies have generated. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't live like that," she said. "I don't feel there's anything you can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Residents and police said they know of no one who has permanently garaged a 
Mercedes-Benz as a result of the robberies, but several residents said they 
take circuitous routes to their homes and keep watch in their rear-view 
mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said that rather than attempting to elude suspicious autos that appear 
to be following, motorists should drive to Ventura Boulevard and head for a 
police station or a telephone in a busy area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confronted in Driveway 
</P>
<P>
He said a Tarzana man thought that he had outdistanced a car that was following 
him last weekend but found himself confronted in his driveway by a man with a 
pistol. The motorist honked his car horn, and the gunman ran away. Shots were 
fired at one woman who drove away after she spotted someone following her. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies and attempts stopped for nearly a month after publicity about the 
pattern followed by the robbers but then resumed last weekend, when there were 
incidents in North Hollywood and Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
The latest robbery occurred Thursday in Benedict Canyon south of Mulholland 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In the shootings, a 53-year-old man who drove his Mercedes-Benz from Beverly 
Hills to North Hollywood to visit his 80-year-old mother was shot twice after 
reaching the door of her home Feb. 5. One bullet struck his mother in a finger, 
frightening her into having a heart attack, police said. Both victims are 
recovering. 
</P>
<P>
A man was shot and seriously injured Dec. 4 when he was confronted at the door 
of his Bel-Air home. On Jan. 12, a robber fired several shots at an Encino 
motorist as she fled from him in a BMW. She was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said the robberies appear to be the work of three sets of suspects 
using similar methods. A light-blue Merkur was identified by victims in at 
least two of the incidents, and police last month released composite drawings 
of two young black men. 
</P>
<P>
Police Detective Patrick Conmay, head of a task force investigating the 
robberies, said police are re-examining the cases, looking for similarities and 
"trying to identify any things that may have been overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, who plans to talk about the robberies at a meeting of the Encino 
Chamber of Commerce on Monday, said he has "jokingly told people that if 
they're driving a Mercedes, they might want to put a Volkswagen ornament on the 
hood . . . to try to fool them."

'JACK ATTACK' IRKS POLITICAL FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack McGrath, write-in candidate for the City Council, is a restless man. 
</P>
<P>
He is forever pacing, puffing cigarettes and fidgeting with the frames on his 
wire-rimmed glasses as he plots political strategy for his campaign against his 
former boss and pal, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Write-in candidates rarely garner more than a small fraction of the vote, but 
McGrath has some big ideas. First he dropped his last name and recast himself 
as "Jack," though the city attorney ruled Thursday that he has to use his full 
name or none on the April 11 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Then he took to the streets with the message that "people power" is back. "I 
love people in the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He found one such street person, a Catholic priest living in a park who asked 
him for a few bucks, and appointed him his North Hollywood coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Theme 
</P>
<P>
And he set out in search of a campaign theme and found it on the side of a 
grocery bag. "The Ralphs bags say change is for the better," McGrath said. "I 
bought 200 of them. The power of that message is very strong." 
</P>
<P>
What happens next is anyone's guess. But the "Jack for City Council" campaign 
is sure to be anything but dull with a candidate such as McGrath, a veteran 
campaign consultant who possesses an Irish street fighter's flair for political 
showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
The paunchy but boyishly handsome McGrath has already delivered a case of 
Russian vodka and some pine saplings to the Bel-Air home of Ronald and Nancy 
Reagan, two of the 5th District's newest arrivals. McGrath also invited the 
former First Couple to call if they have any problems, such as potholes. 
</P>
<P>
More recently he stood outside Yaroslavsky's City Hall office and brazenly 
accused the councilman of financial shenanigans. McGrath holds Yaroslavsky 
responsible for traffic congestion, intense commercial growth, the parking 
shortage and just about everything else that's wrong with Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky has deftly deflected the charges leveled by his former chief deputy 
so far but professes to be genuinely mystified by McGrath's sudden emergence as 
a political foe. "I don't have much to say about it because I have no idea why 
he's running," Yaroslavsky said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Others who are close to both men also question what's motivating McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disastrous Move' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disastrous move," said one confidant, who asked to remain anonymous. 
"There's no rational basis for what Jack is doing here." 
</P>
<P>
"People are worried about him," said another, who also spoke anonymously. "A 
lot of his friends don't want to have anything to do with him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, 43, who decided to run as a write-in candidate after he failed to 
collect the 500 signatures needed to formally qualify for the ballot, said he's 
aware of his friends' concerns. But in dismissing those concerns he is fond of 
invoking the name of one of his heroes, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm reaching for the promised land," McGrath said recently. "And I'm not 
afraid to die politically. If I die politically, my life still goes on. But if 
I don't die, that means that I get to serve my constituency." 
</P>
<P>
People who have worked with him over the years say such hyperbole is typical of 
McGrath, who was once described as the merry prankster of municipal politics. 
The North Hollywood resident is credited with adding spark to the campaigns of 
clients such as Yaroslavsky and state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) in the 
1970s. And in November he helped mount a highly successful reelection bid on 
behalf of Santa Monica City Councilman Herb Katz. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has a reputation for recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Resigned Over Commercial 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, while serving as campaign manager for city attorney candidate Bob 
Ronka, McGrath was involved in the making of a television commercial linking 
Ronka's opponent, Ira Reiner, to convicted murderer Charles Manson. McGrath 
resigned under pressure after the spot was roundly denounced. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath also got into hot water with Yaroslavsky about that time for using the 
councilman's name to promote a real estate venture. People who have worked with 
McGrath say he often has a hard time distinguishing right from wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't help Jack he will get into trouble," said one political 
consultant, who asked not to be named. "He has a tendency to step into it." 
</P>
<P>
"He has always been one of the most creative people around," another said. "He 
just pops with ideas. But he often loses his judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Many see McGrath's decision to run as an illustration of that point. At the 
outset of the campaign season, when Yaroslavsky was expecting to run for mayor 
and others started lining up to succeed him on the council, McGrath signed on 
as an aide to Steve Saltzman, a veteran political activist from Century City. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after Yaroslavsky changed his mind and filed for reelection that 
McGrath suddenly emerged as a candidate himself. 
</P>
<P>
"One night we had dinner with a possible contributor," Saltzman said. "On the 
following morning, unbeknown to me, Jack filed to run for the seat. . . . It 
seemed ludicrous. He had no funds, no campaign management and no support." 
</P>
<P>
The move also surprised Yaroslavsky since McGrath had just attended his yearly 
Christmas party and given $500 to his mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"He was patting me on the back at my party," Yaroslavsky said. "He had his arm 
around me. . . . It was very friendly and chatty. I guess in the first week of 
January he decided that my performance had diminished considerably." 
</P>
<P>
The story soon made the rounds that McGrath had also neglected to reveal his 
plans to his wife, Maria. McGrath conceded that she was "pissed off" about the 
decision and that even now she "is not emotionally committed to this." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, McGrath defends the move. "Sometimes you have to make your 
own decisions," he said. "We're not fighting over it now, though we did 
initially. She said, 'Why you?' And I said, 'Why not me?' " 
</P>
<P>
McGrath says he first became disenchanted with Yaroslavsky while working for 
Saltzman. Everywhere he went, he said, people complained about development, 
traffic tie-ups and other problems. "I thought, 'Jeez, what happened?' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath might have kept his reservations to himself if Yaroslavsky had followed 
through on his plans to run for mayor. But when Yaroslavsky filed for 
reelection in early January, causing speculation that Saltzman would drop out, 
which he later did, McGrath said he had to act. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent two days considering my options," he said. "I drove around past places 
where things had happened in my life. Then I decided to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
Many wish he hadn't. People who travel in the same political circles as McGrath 
and Yaroslavsky say McGrath has nothing to gain and everything to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it is not a productive act on his part, but I don't know how to talk to 
him about it," said Jackie Brainard, a friend of both men. "I guess he really 
believes he can do a better job, and that's why he's running." 
</P>
<P>
Added Richard Lichtenstein of Marathon Communications, who hired McGrath to 
help out with Santa Monica City Councilman Katz's reelection campaign: "I told 
Jack that everybody's entitled to run. But I also reminded him to campaign in a 
manner that's not going to do him irreparable harm." 
</P>
<P>
As he sat in his tidy ranchstyle house recently, smoking cigarettes, drinking 
coffee and thumbing through a scrapbook that still contains several pictures of 
himself and Yaroslavsky, McGrath questions what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he's just one of three people challenging Yaroslavsky, the others 
being Westwood activist Laura M. Lake and traffic consultant Ryan Snyder. And 
he's the only challenger who possesses City Hall experience. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said San Fernando Valley voters, who account for about one-third of the 
5th District's registered voters, have been waiting for one of their own to 
assume power. In one of his strongest campaign pitches, McGrath has pledged to 
protect his neighbors from the kind of growth that has occurred on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
"As councilman I would only approve good development," McGrath said. "And when 
I say good, I mean damn good. If not, let 'em build it in Cudahy." 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, the son of two professional dance teachers who worked at the Arthur 
Murray studios, grew up in the Valley and has lived there most of his life. In 
addition to serving as Yaroslavsky's campaign manager and deputy, he has been a 
lobbyist, a bus-shelter firm executive and a state Assembly candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently he was employed as a commercial real estate broker. McGrath said 
he is not concerned that his real estate dealings may cost him credibility 
within the slow-growth community. "All we do is the buildings that Zev has 
already OKd," McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
What people on both sides of Mulholland Drive are most interested in is finding 
someone who understands and shares their frustrations, he said, adding that 
solving problems is easy once you understand how the bureaucracy works. 
</P>
<P>
On a quick ride through his neighborhood McGrath points to a health club that 
suffers from a parking shortage and a weeded area that people could be using as 
a dog run, then claims he could instantly rectify both problems once he got 
into City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
He expounds on that theme in a cable television commercial that highlights 
problems plaguing the district. The commercial ends, inexplicably, with a 
lingering shot of McGrath talking to a man bundled up like an Eskimo. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath knows that he suffers some credibility problems because of his past 
political mistakes and his recent failure to qualify for the ballot. But he 
also revels in the role of underdog and political provocateur. 
</P>
<P>
People who have known him for a long time say he is only happy when he's in the 
thick of things. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm a long shot," McGrath said. "But my whole life has been a long 
shot. People said I was crazy in 1975 when I first supported Zev for the City 
Council, and they're saying I'm crazy now. But these people are going to be 
surprised. They're going to see the best street operation ever run."

'NOW THERE'S A LIGHT,' DISABLED GIRL'S MOTHER SAYS ABOUT SETTLEMENT

<P>
Barbara Ruben turned down the volume of her daughter's nursery rhyme record and 
answered the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
It had been ringing all day Saturday. Friends were calling to congratulate her 
on winning a medical malpractice settlement that could end up totaling $17.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks I'm rich," Ruben said, finally taking the kitchen wall phone 
off its hook. "I have to tell people that I'm not going to Europe next week or 
buying a Mercedes. The money goes to Lauren." 
</P>
<P>
From her wheelchair, 6-year-old Lauren Ruben brightened at the sound of her 
name. 
</P>
<P>
A pretty, dark-haired girl who looks like a typical first-grader, Lauren cannot 
walk or talk or sit up by herself. But she recognizes her name and smiles when 
she hears it. She tries to reach out but cannot lift her arms. 
</P>
<P>
Severely brain-damaged just after her birth, Lauren has the mental ability of a 
9-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
She must be hand-fed and diapered. She wears special leg braces during the day, 
when she can be propped up in her padded, child-sized wheelchair. She sleeps at 
night in a body jacket to support her spine. 
</P>
<P>
Lauren must be watched constantly. 
</P>
<P>
A structured malpractice case settlement approved Thursday with Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center will pay for physical therapy and 24-hour-a-day care for the 
rest of Lauren's life. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a burden has been lifted," Barbara Ruben, 43, said Saturday. "One of my 
biggest fears has been what will happen to her after I'm gone. Who will drop in 
to visit Lauren at the old state hospital?" 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, Cedars-Sinai's insurers will pay $500,000 in 90 
days for Lauren's care and will place $900,000 more in an interest-paying 
annuity account. That account will eventually be tapped to make monthly 
payments to Lauren for the rest of her life. If she lives to be 70, the 
payments will total $17.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
None of the money will go to Barbara Ruben or her former husband, Jay Ruben of 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have paid dearly for the mix-up at Cedars-Sinai on Nov. 17, 1982, 
when a young medical intern took more than five hours to notice that newborn 
Lauren's respiratory system was not sufficiently supplying her brain with 
oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, the Rubens learned from a doctor the extent of their 
daughter's resulting brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
"On a Tuesday, I had a little girl that I thought had colic. On Wednesday, I 
had a severely retarded, spastic quadriplegic -- a child that will never 
function properly," Barbara Ruben said. 
</P>
<P>
The stress from their daughter's condition contributed to the couple's breakup 
and divorce two years later. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben eventually took on three part-time jobs to make ends meet. When Lauren 
turned 3 and was enrolled in a special education program at Reseda's Lokrantz 
Elementary School, Ruben began working as a secretary at Congregation Beth 
Kodesh in Canoga Park, as an independent printing saleswoman and as manager of 
the Reseda townhouse complex where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I love her," she said. "I cried and cried when they wanted to put her on a bus 
to take her to school." 
</P>
<P>
Her condominium neighbors help Ruben load the child's heavy, $3,800 wheelchair 
into her 1983 Honda when Ruben takes Lauren to therapy sessions. They 
occasionally baby-sit when Ruben needs to make quick runs to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a personal life," Ruben said. "I don't go to the movies -- I 
can't remember the last movie I saw in a theater. I never go out to dinner. I 
never go out with friends. I haven't had a vacation since 1981." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement will change some of that. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the $5,500 monthly payments will go for Lauren's therapy. Those 
treatments are designed to keep her arms and legs from withering and to do such 
things as teach her to chew. 
</P>
<P>
The money will also be used to buy a lift-equipped mini-van and to hire nurses' 
aides to look after Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
"Lauren must be watched constantly. She needs a lot of little things that you 
and I take for granted. She can't give a good, deep cough to clear her throat. 
All she can do is cry when she hurts. She can't lift her hand and point if her 
ear hurts, for example." 
</P>
<P>
Once help is hired and trained, "I'd like to spend a weekend in Palm Springs. 
Trips to New York and Florida to see relatives will come later," Ruben said. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement call for annual verification of expenditures made for 
Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
"Lauren's my client for the rest of my life," said lawyer Bruce G. Fagel, who 
represented Ruben. It was Fagel, who worked as a medical doctor for 10 years -- 
including a stint at Cedars-Sinai -- who discovered the hospital's negligence. 
</P>
<P>
"People see the $17.5-million figure and assume it's a big pot of money. But 
that's the cost of medical care for this child. It will simply keep the child 
alive, as alive and functional as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's technology to let her interact with her environment that is 
developed in 50 years, she deserves the right to be here to benefit from it." 
</P>
<P>
Cedars-Sinai officials have refused to comment on Lauren's case other than to 
acknowledge the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben said she has slowly come to grips with her daughter's condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always said I wished Lauren's mentality could be intact," she said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I don't know. In her little world, she's content. To be physically locked 
in a body like that for life and know it would be worse." 
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday's settlement, Ruben had felt things could only get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going deeper and deeper into the hole," she said. "There was no light at 
the end of the tunnel. Now there's a light."

911 SYSTEM CRASHES; COMPUTER IS BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city emergency 911 telephone system crashed twice Saturday 
afternoon -- once for 45 minutes -- according to officials, who blamed the 
breakdown on a computer malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
For four hours, the system was only partly functioning as Pacific Bell 
engineers worked to repair computers at the Police Department's central 
dispatch center in the basement of City Hall East, said Sgt. John Emerson of 
the department's Communications Division. Officials reported that the problems 
were fixed by 5:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were not aware of any emergency that went unanswered, but some 
of the Police Department's stations reported an increase in calls as people 
unable to get through to 911 operators called them directly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crashed a Second Time 
</P>
<P>
Operators first discovered the phone lines out about 1 p.m., Emerson said. 
Pacific Bell engineers restored parts of the system five minutes later, he 
said, but at 3 p.m the system crashed again. A backup system also failed, 
stopping all emergency calls for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our computer has gone belly-up all over the place," Emerson said. "This has 
never happened to us in the 911 system." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell officials said that four out of five callers who were unable to 
get through to 911 operators were getting a recorded message. They said the 
shutdown was caused by a power failure in the computer's signaling mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
A similar but shorter blackout occurred Feb. 16, 1987; that one-hour outage was 
also blamed on a power failure. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers once again succeeded in restoring the system's phone lines at 3:45, 
Emerson said. But the system's computers were still not working by late 
afternoon and the 25 operators at the dispatch center were forced to process 
calls manually, Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Computers normally display the address and phone number of the person making 
the emergency call. With the computers down, the operators had to transfer 
calls by hand. "It's been so long since we've used this old (manual) system," 
Emerson said. "We've just stepped back 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
Operators at the center receive about 200 calls per hour and relay them to 
police and fire stations. Even after the phone lines were restored, operators 
were having difficulty transfering the calls to Fire Department dispatchers, 
Emerson said. 
</P>
<P>
Emerson said that although people making calls to the emergency number might be 
placed on hold for a few seconds longer, all calls were being answered by late 
Saturday. "If people aren't calling in too much, we'll be OK," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At some Police Department stations, officers noticed an increase in emergency 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, no one officially told us why we were getting them," 
said Officer Tony Rivera of the Wilshire Station. "A few people told us that 
they called 911 and were put on hold for . . . (an) unbelievable time." 
</P>
<P>
Calls made to police at the Hollenbeck Station were relayed by radio to 
dispatchers at City Hall, said Officer William Malin. "Everything was screwed 
up, but it worked all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police in the field monitored the radio transmissions so that units that were 
close to the site of the emergency could let dispatchers know that they were 
available, Malin said. 
</P>
<P>
Twice during the afternoon, Police and Fire Department officials released the 
numbers of nine police and fire stations to call instead of 911 in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wells, a spokesman for the Los Angeles City Fire Deparment, explained that 
although by late afternoon calls were getting through to 911 dispatchers, the 
alternative numbers were provided as a "precautionary measure" in case the 
system broke down again. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ron Young of the Northeast Station said it was fortunate that the breakdown 
occurred Saturday afternoon, during a quiet part of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Things really haven't gotten rolling yet. This is the calm before the storm on 
the weekends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized 911 system was installed in Los Angeles in 1983. Located four 
floors below ground level, it is designed to withstand a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good system," said Pacific Bell spokeswoman Lisa Zanville. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of calls received by the system operators are not emergencies and 
are transferred to radio dispatchers who assign patrol cars according to 
priority and availability. In life-threatening situations, however, operators 
immediately dispatch the caller's location to patrol cars.

ANCIENT ASIAN GAME COULD GO FAR AS AMERICANS CATCH ON 
</P>

Alan Chen, a child prodigy at the ancient Asian game of go, methodically 
counted the black pebble-like pieces before him on a wooden board. At game's 
close, the 10-year-old totaled his score and discovered that he had defeated 
his opponent, a man who looked old enough to be his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a tournament in Monterey Park. And although Alan was the 
object of admiration, he said he would tell classmates he had gone camping. 
</P>
<P>
"They tease me," he said. He is timid about discussing the game that was 
developed thousands of years ago in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little-Known in West 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing shy about Alan's aggressive play, however; he is one of the 
top 20 child players in the United States. Nor was there any lack of intensity 
among the dozens of other tournament players or among the scores of spectators 
who filled a Lincoln Park Hotel ballroom on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The dominant sound was not conversation. It was the clicking into place on 
wooden boards of plastic pieces known as stones. Most participants smoked 
incessantly as they pondered their games. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few non-Asian Westerners know much about go. Most have never heard of 
it. Yet the game is played by millions in the Orient and is firmly established 
in U.S. cities, mostly on the East and West coasts, where there are many newly 
arrived Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Go clubs in Los Angeles, Monterey Park, New York and San Francisco (where the 
first American club opened in 1936) are open around the clock on weekends. 
Membership in the New York-based American Go Assn. has doubled to 1,300 in the 
last three years, and interest has spread beyond the traditional following of 
Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, because of its large number of players, qualifies as the 
nation's go capital. There are three major Los Angeles clubs in the Chinese, 
Korean and Japanese communities and many others that meet in homes, offices and 
churches in Orange County, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, 
Gardena and even in the back room of a Los Angeles barbershop. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs in Santa Barbara, San Jose and San Diego, as well as in Boston, 
Baltimore, Washington, Miami, Dallas, Chicago and Seattle also have large 
followings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Blind Spot in West 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started playing 10 years ago, nobody had heard of go," said 
Barbara Calhoun, a partner in a New York employee benefits consulting firm and 
president of the American Go Assn. "Now people at least say: 'Isn't that the 
Oriental game with black and white pieces, the war game.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a blind spot in the West," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Increased interest in Southern California happened partly because of Alan 
Chen's father, Arcadia businessman James Chen, who learned go in the Taiwanese 
army. Chen has functioned as a go ambassador in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, James Chen brought from China one of Shanghai's top coaches for 
children. Yang Yilun moved in with Chen and taught Chen's children. 
</P>
<P>
Yang also has taught 200 other youngsters at the American Go Institute, which 
James Chen and others set up to spread the word about go in the United States. 
Chen also has launched correspondence courses for American adults. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Chen brought together the top players from two countries that, 
because of political differences, had never competed. It was on neutral soil in 
Los Angeles and San Francisco that China's top player, Nie Weiping, met one of 
South Korea's best, Cho Hun Hyun. 
</P>
<P>
For the recent Christmas-New Year's tournament, Chen drew several of the 
world's best players to Monterey Park. The highlight was a match featuring Nie, 
whom Sports Illustrated has called "the master of the masters." 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Nie, playing one of his students, astonished fans by losing 
twice, but this spring he will have a chance to recoup. He will compete in a 
world title game against a South Korean player. About $500,000 in prize money 
will be at stake in the tournament to be played in Asia at an 
as-yet-undetermined site. 
</P>
<P>
In Asia, top professional players -- like marathon runners -- peak in their 
late 20s and early 30s. Because of the mental and physical endurance go 
requires, they are viewed as erudite athletes. Matches can last for days, with 
players sitting before a board for 10 to 12 hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
But -- as with golf, tennis and bridge in the West -- most go enthusiasts are 
amateurs looking for diversion. 
</P>
<P>
"Go can be profound," said Richard Dolen, a Santa Monica computer software 
designer and president of the American Go Institute. "But since so many people 
play go, it must not always be so profound. There is something there for the 
common man." 
</P>
<P>
Said Aaron Rosen, president of a San Francisco club, "You can learn it in five 
minutes and spend the rest of your life not mastering it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Playing Field 
</P>
<P>
The board is divided by lines into 19 columns, creating 361 squares. One player 
uses black pieces; the other white. 
</P>
<P>
Each player take turns placing a stone, in a permanent position, on any one of 
the intersections of the squares. 
</P>
<P>
The object, as with soldiers on a battlefield, is to eventually overtake the 
opposition by surrounding it; hence, the game's Chinese name, WEI QI, 
surrounding chess. (Go is the game's Japanese name.) 
</P>
<P>
Whoever attains control of more than half of the board wins. 
</P>
<P>
What entices people, many of them former chess players, is that no game has the 
same pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like six games of chess going on at once and they interact," Dolen said. 
"You can't win with a single punch. There are many battles at once." 
</P>
<P>
Repeating one legend, Rosen said go was invented 4,500 years ago by a Chinese 
emperor who wanted to improve the mind of his dimwitted son. And, Rosen said 
jokingly, "We have a lot of idiots still playing 4,500 years later." 
</P>
<P>
"The moves reflect your personality," said Long Beach's Larry R. Holmgren, a 
high school algebra teacher and one of the few whites in Monterey Park's 
U.S.-Chinese Go Assn. "If you're greedy, envious, jealous or don't know what 
you're doing, or if you're defensive or fearful, your moves will show that." 
</P>
<P>
For many players, go is deadly serious. A Japanese go master once cropped his 
hair in atonement for his country's loss to China. Generals have postponed 
battles to complete a game. And the atom bomb blast in 1945 interrupted but did 
not thwart the completion of a Japanese title match in a Hiroshima suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Park club, in a small storefront office on Garfield Avenue, is 
often filled with members on lunch breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Formed six years ago with just 22 members, the Monterey Park club has 180 
members who pay $50 monthly dues. Among them are 15 women, including two former 
pros from China. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend of the New Year's tournament at the club, Chinese characters had 
been fashioned from red paper and bordered by Santa Claus cutouts to announce 
that the club "welcomes China's top player to California." 
</P>
<P>
Club member Wen-king Chow surveyed the men around him, hunched over boards on 
long tables. "This is not a gambling game," said Chow, 68. "This is for 
high-class people." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out a UCLA graduate, then a past Hawaiian go champion and the club's 
pro, T. C. Chang, a master player when he lived in Taiwan. "The player over 
there was a general in Chiang Kai-shek's army," he said of a sturdy man, 
graying at the temples and in deep concentration. 
</P>
<P>
Chow stopped talking and suddenly clapped once, loudly. In swept an entourage 
led by James Chen and followed by Nie Weiping and his wife, Kong Xiangming, one 
the best women players in the world. 
</P>
<P>
After greetings, Nie gathered three others for bridge. In this type of setting, 
James Chen explained, Nie will not play go. After all, he won't even play the 
game with Deng Xiaoping, China's top leader, his weekend bridge partner. He 
doesn't like to lose to just anybody, Chen said.

SC AND ITS NEIGHBORS -- TENSION

Terry Bayliss said it was a day of awakening for an 18-year-old boy out of 
Springfield, Ore. He caught his first glimpse of the University of Southern 
California from the window of an airport shuttle bus. And when he got off the 
shuttle, he got his first glimpse of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The first day I got here, I was dropped off at the University Hilton across 
the street and I was immediately accosted by two men asking me for money," said 
Bayliss, now a 20-year-old junior at the university. "And I remember walking 
through the (school) gate -- and feeling safe." 
</P>
<P>
It was different for John Singleton, a USC student who grew up in the shadow of 
the university. He remembers wearing the Trojan emblem on his jacket, attending 
the school's camp for underprivileged youth, even taking classes at the Museum 
of Science and Industry right across the street -- but he never dared walk 
through that gate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Out of Reach' 
</P>
<P>
"When I used to hang around the museum . . . I would look across and see USC," 
said Singleton, 21. "But I never set foot on the campus until I started going 
here. I thought it was too far out of my reach. It was alien . . . like an 
island." 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of modest homes, graffiti-scarred storefronts and run-down 
apartment houses sits USC -- an imposing 150-acre anomaly with 30,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
In the best of times the low-income largely minority area and the wealthy 
university are neighbors who coexist peacefully, looking at one another with a 
mixture of interest and indifference. 
</P>
<P>
But in the wake of such incidents as a string of campus rapes last fall and the 
shooting of a 21-year-old USC student last month, the relationship between the 
university and its neighbors has often become strained. 
</P>
<P>
Students hear rumors floating down fraternity row that gangs are targeting 
students, and taunts from friends that they go to college in a crime-filled 
ghetto. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors have their own worries, fears of crime, anger that the picture of 
violence in the area is blown out of proportion, and the feeling by many that 
whenever a USC student is the victim of a crime, the whole community becomes 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two years, the university has been implementing programs that 
Alvin Rudisill, the school's associate vice president for community relations, 
calls "the most substantial, significant and serious steps" it has ever taken 
to improve relations between the community and the university. For example, 
members of the university and community started a United Neighborhood Council 
last year to improve communications. 
</P>
<P>
Security measures on the inner-city campus are already stringent. Besides 131 
security officers, the university has 40 escorts to walk and drive students on 
and off campus. In fact, violent crimes committed against students have 
decreased since 1987, according to campus security; robberies declined 44% and 
assaults with deadly weapons dropped 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's attack was the first shooting of a USC student in nearly a decade, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Problems 
</P>
<P>
The tensions between the university and its neighbors extend beyond crime and 
race. Some longtime residents fear that the university is taking over the 
community through expansion and that more attention is paid to its concerns 
than to the community's. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, not long after Kimberly Warfield was shot in the back as she entered 
her university-owned apartment house, students could be seen riding their bikes 
down Jefferson Boulevard at night and dining with community residents at yogurt 
shops and restaurants along Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go to school everyday and be scared to death," said Alan Hoffman, 
20, who lives with Bayliss in the apartment building in which Warfield was 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Some students say there is an unofficially designated safety zone, beyond which 
they do not dare venture alone. "Between 28th Street and the campus is 
basically where you stay," said Julie Pritchess, a 20-year-old sophomore at the 
university. "Any other time you're off campus, you're headed for the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Says Hoffman: "You could say I'm afraid (of the community). . . . This 
university is an island in the middle of crime and poverty. . . . They 
(recruiters) said USC is in a downtown area and you had to be careful. What 
they didn't say is you have to walk around looking over your shoulder, that if 
you're a female you (can't) go out at night, that your downstairs neighbor is 
going to be shot." 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the fact that USC is located in the police division with the 
third highest crime rate in the city, people who live nearby, including gang 
members, are not necessarily the culprits in crimes committed against students, 
according to university security officials. "With any university, whether it's 
UCLA, Cal State L.A. or USC, you're concentrating victims in one area and 
people who commit crimes are going to be attracted to those areas," said Lt. 
Jim Kenady, who added that gang members usually target each other and not 
students. 
</P>
<P>
But according to some of those living near the university, the actions of law 
enforcement officials speak for themselves. After serious crimes, they said 
they feel suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people feel a little resentment toward the school because whenever there 
is a problem at the college, most of the time the perpetrator is (believed to 
be) black," said Ann Hudson, who has lived in an apartment near the university 
for 14 years. "Well you've got a lot of black people in this community and when 
something happens, the whole community is scrutinized." 
</P>
<P>
"You're stigmatized," Lucille B. Romain said, adding that she believes such 
generalizations result because the university and its students have not tried 
to get to know their neighbors. In short, she said, "the campus is not part of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
"The students could care less because their future is not here," said Romain, 
who has lived six blocks from the university for 17 years, and is part of a 
joint USC-community council designed to improve relations. "They have the 
attitude, 'I may live near you but I don't have to like you, I don't have to be 
your friend.' " 
</P>
<P>
She says she sees that attitude every time she goes on campus. "They just don't 
welcome you. When I walk the track they stare like 'what are you doing here.' 
You just don't feel you belong there." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman agreed. "I think students from the university tend to look through the 
people in the community, like they're not even there. They try to ignore 
anybody who is not obviously an affluent USC student." 
</P>
<P>
University officials, citing various student volunteer groups and activities, 
contend that the students who look down upon and fear the community are the 
exception. "Many in our society are afraid of differences in people, and in 
part we are talking about differences that relate to race and socioeconomic 
experience that some USC students are having for the first time," said Dr. Jim 
Dennis, USC's vice president of student affairs. "But most find our neighbors 
have many of the same concerns, anxieties and aspirations that they do and 
(want to) work hard with the community to make it better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Source of Inspiration 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, the students and their neighbors even find inspiration in one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the most intense and valued friendships I've made are with my 
neighbors," said Philip Clement, 23, Student Senate president who lives six 
blocks away from campus in housing that is not university owned. "I've met 
first-generation immigrants from El Salvador and Mexico and they've been 
inspiring to me in what they've done and what they are trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Martinez, a 41-year-old unemployed caterer, lives a five-minute walk 
away from the university and walks there often. 
</P>
<P>
"I see what USC gives to us (in the community) if we want to get it," says 
Martinez, who sends two of his children to the 32nd Street-USC magnet school. 
"I go there and the students are friendly. . . . They treat me like I'm 
somebody. The school is an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
There are complaints by some that it is hard to grow up near a university where 
many community residents could never afford to send their children. "That's a 
hell of a thing," said neighborhood activist Leon Watkins. Neighborhood 
children "go to the football games. They identify with the Trojans and (many) 
want to go there." But not many do. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez says the fact that the university is there is what can make 
neighborhood children, like his own, even more determined to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
Many a day, said Martinez, he dons his USC cap, walks down the middle of the 
campus, and dreams. "I think to myself, if I could be born again, renew my 
life, I'd be one of these students. . . . I'm glad to live in this 
neighborhood, near this university. I hope one day my kids are going to be 
there."

'FOLLOW-HOME ROBBERS' STIR FEAR IN POSH AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some well-heeled residents say they are shunning their prized luxury cars and 
converting garage door openers and car phones into crime-fighting tools in the 
hillside neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley and the Westside that are the 
prime stalking ground of the "follow-home robbers." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for methods to deal with the robbers come up frequently in conversations 
with friends who own Mercedes-Benz cars -- the most frequent common element in 
the robberies -- said Sue Kaplan, a secretary at the Encino Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"I got very nervous when I was followed into a real obscure cul de sac" last 
week, said Kaplan, who drives a new BMW. But she stopped and the other vehicle 
drove on. "I think the normal person is certainly aware of what's out there and 
they're going to keep their eyes open." 
</P>
<P>
Encino has been the area hardest hit by the robbers, who spot women driving 
expensive cars, follow them home and rob them. Police estimate that the robbers 
have netted nearly $300,000 in cash and jewels, and blame them for three 
shooting incidents in which three people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
No suspects have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 31 robberies or attempted robberies since the series began in October, 
22 have been in the Valley -- 12 in Encino and most of the others in the 
foothills between Sherman Oaks and Woodland Hills. Nine occurred in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of a few husbands who have swapped vehicles with their wives and they 
are driving the Corvettes and the Mercedes and the wives are driving the 
rent-a-wrecks," said Jack Feldman, past president of the Encino Chamber of 
Commerce. "It's at best a difficult situation that has a lot of people on 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. John Higgins, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's West 
Valley division, urged drivers with car phones to use them to alert police if 
they suspect that they are being followed. "They could give us a running 
account . . . of exactly where they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who lives near the Corinthian Drive residence in Encino where the 
female driver of a Mercedes-Benz was robbed Jan. 11 said she avoids driving her 
husband's new BMW 525 and sticks to her 4-year-old BMW 325. 
</P>
<P>
"I drive my own car . . . which is older, rather than attract attention to 
myself," said the woman, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
She also wears less jewelry, said her husband, a Los Angeles attorney. Both of 
them have become adept at using the electric garage door opener, he said. "We 
don't leave our car. We drive in, hit the button and shut it again." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the woman said, she thinks she was followed home from a shopping trip 
to the upscale Gelson's Market on Ventura Boulevard last week by a car carrying 
two men. She drove past her home and farther into the hills and eventually the 
men dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
A Gelson's spokesman said none of the incidents have started at the store but 
added that the store's security personnel are aware of the robberies and are 
watching for anyone matching police descriptions of suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they know of no relationship between the robberies and driving from 
a particular location. 
</P>
<P>
A Tarzana executive who drives a Mercedes 560 and whose wife drives a Mercedes 
420 said they both were being very careful when returning home. "We are being 
very aware of vehicles parked on the street that we normally don't see," he 
said. "If that happens we'll report the vehicle to the police." 
</P>
<P>
But Sandra Leiman of Encino, who drives a Mercedes, said she is unwilling to 
give in to the fears the robberies have generated. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't live like that," she said. "I don't feel there's anything you can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said that rather than attempting to elude suspicious vehicles that 
appear to be following them, motorists should return to Ventura Boulevard and 
head for a police station or a telephone in a busy area. 
</P>
<P>
He said a Tarzana man thought he had outdistanced a car that was following him 
last Sunday night but found himself confronted in his driveway by a man with a 
pistol. The motorist blew his car horn and the gunman ran away. Shots were 
fired at one woman who drove away after she spotted someone following her. 
</P>
<P>
The robberies and robbery attempts had stopped for nearly a month, after police 
reports about the pattern followed by the robbers, but then resumed last 
weekend, when there were incidents in North Hollywood and Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
The latest robbery occurred Thursday on Benedict Canyon Drive south of 
Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the shooting incidents, a 53-year-old man who drove his Mercedes-Benz 
from Beverly Hills to North Hollywood to visit his 80-year-old mother was shot 
twice after reaching the door of his mother's home last Sunday. One bullet 
struck his mother in a finger, frightening the woman into a heart attack, 
police said. Both victims are recovering.

He's so bent on keeping his private life private ("You won't see any headlines 
about me in those supermarket tabloids") that, during an interview, he wouldn't 
even say if he's married or single. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'm married and maybe I'm not," said Wahl, who then implored a reporter 
to not even mention a private life. "Give me your word," he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Chain-smoking unfiltered Camels and drinking hot cocoa, Wahl was kicked back on 
a rented couch in the living room of his brownstone apartment in downtown 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Wahl had worked into the night on his series -- one of a growing number of TV 
shows and movies that shoot in Vancouver. The hour was late, but a reporter was 
told not to rush. The reason: "You're only going to get this one shot." 
</P>
<P>
Wahl had agreed to the interview only after some negotiations. His deal was 
this: He would not allow a reporter to visit the set to watch him work. ("You 
have your little rules, and I have mine. When we're on the set, that's our 
time. Nobody messes with that.") He would not be photographed; photos were 
supplied by the series photographer. 
</P>
<P>
"To be perfectly honest, the reason I'm doing this is basically to get (the 
series publicist) off my back. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't take it personal. It's just that I would feel foolish if I was on the 
covers of magazines. It's not anything I've ever wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Added Wahl: "I'm sort of proud of the fact that I'm sort of a -- for want of a 
better term -- an anti-celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in what are more or less his trademark duds -- sweat shirt, jeans, 
black boots -- he didn't look the part of The Celebrity. And he didn't act the 
part. He made no pretenses about enjoying the interview process. At the same 
time, he seemed determined to see through his side of "the deal." He thought 
over questions carefully and even asked to return to certain nagging points. 
</P>
<P>
Including his predilection for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Which Steven J. Cannell, executive producer and co-creator of "Wiseguy," summed 
up this way: "He's saying I'll do the lines and perform the part, but I'm not 
going to be this year's pitchman. I'm not going to be this year's hunk." 
</P>
<P>
As Wahl -- who does not have a personal publicist -- pointed out, "Wiseguy" has 
garnered attention and critical acclaim without him having played the role of 
Cover Boy. 
</P>
<P>
"We get a lot of letters. What I'm proud of is that people write in not because 
Ken Wahl's this big celebrity and he's seen at Laker's games and (stuff) like 
that. Or because of who Ken Wahl's going out with, or what scandal he's 
involved in, or that he was at this or that Hollywood bash. 
</P>
<P>
"They're writing in because they like the show. They like the characters. They 
like the stories. That's what's important." 
</P>
<P>
The story of "Wiseguy" is as follows: Vinnie spent 18 months in the pen -- to 
establish himself with the Mob (and other nefarious types). Now he works 
undercover for the OCB -- that's the Organized Crime Bureau. Because the bad 
guys he works with are often so enticing, Vinnie's often in a state of moral 
psychosis . . . sometimes seeming to teeter dangerously close to his own dark 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Except for those formal nights out with the bad guys/gals, Vinnie doesn't sport 
a GQ wardrobe. He sports a Ken Wahl wardrobe (lots of T-shirts and sweat 
shirts). And he eschews Ferraris for fixer-upper muscle cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Vinnie's more your regular guy," said Wahl, who takes great pride in being the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Born 30 years ago on the south side of Chicago, Wahl grew up "bouncing back and 
forth" between Chicago and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Today, home is "somewhere" in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Where? "Just somewhere," said Wahl, who spoke highly of "hanging out in the 
Bronx with buddies of mine." Foremost among those buddies is best friend Tony 
Ganios -- who recently guested as the lawyer of a garment-industry crime lord 
on "Wiseguy." Wahl and Ganios have been pals since they appeared in the 1979 
cult film "The Wanderers" as members of the same gang. 
</P>
<P>
Wahl also has done some palling around with former Penthouse Pet of the Month, 
Corinne Alphen. Publicity materials for his 1984 film, "Purple Hearts," mention 
their marriage. (Alphen was billed as Corinne Wahl when she displayed her 
measurements in one of the sketches in John Landis' "Amazon Women on the 
Moon.") In 1984, the Hollywood Reporter announced they'd named their newborn 
son Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
Wahl wouldn't elaborate. Asked if he has a son, he answered: "Possibly." 
</P>
<P>
With shades of tough guy Terranova -- and his own "regular guy" background -- 
Wahl doesn't refer to the film/TV world as "the industry" or "the business," 
per regular show-business parlance. 
</P>
<P>
He calls it "this racket." Or "this scam." 
</P>
<P>
"This is just what I do for a living. It's not my whole reason for living," 
said Wahl. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way, I'm a regular guy with the exception of having an unusual -- 
by regular guy standards -- occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm glad of it," smiled 
</P>
<P>
Wahl, adding: "It's true that a bank account gives me security, and that is a 
big thing. But it doesn't change who I am." 
</P>
<P>
(Later, after mentioning that he has a personal assistant and a driver on 
"Wiseguy," Wahl stressed, "but when I'm in the Bronx, I don't have a personal 
assistant and a driver. So there!") 
</P>
<P>
 Wahl also likes to keep his distance -- literally -- from Hollywood/L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"People in L.A. are the industry," he said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
As for the town's so-called parties: "I went to a couple. It's funny how people 
don't really have a good time at those things. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because they're not really parties. They're too much business and not 
enough fun. You have to watch what you say and watch what you do, because this 
guy's the head of this and that guy's the head of that, and he's this guy's 
agent and blah, blah." 
</P>
<P>
With a grimace, he added: "And how could I forgot those freeways in L.A. -- and 
the traffic jams? 
</P>
<P>
"And another thing -- Mercedes are like Fords down there. Everything seems to 
be about creating an image." 
</P>
<P>
'Muscle Car' Collector 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of which, Wahl -- who has disdain for "status-seeking auto buying" -- 
stressed "all the cars I've got, combined, didn't cost as much as one new 
Corvette today." A collector of "muscle" cars, he's got 11 Dodges and 
Plymouths. And, Wahl bragged, he's still driving the 1971 Chevelle he bought 
for $600. 
</P>
<P>
So where does he keep all these cars? "Somewhere back home," said Wahl, who 
shrugged off his automotive infatuation, explaining: "My dad's a mechanic." 
</P>
<P>
It was Wahl who came up with the idea of having Vinnie drive a $3,500 1970 
Dodge Challenger. "That's much more real life," he said, "it fits his 
neighborhood -- and his character." 
</P>
<P>
And the idea of casting Jerry Lewis in the recent story line about a 
garment-industry businessman and his son was Wahl's. "He was so fantastic in 
'King of Comedy,' " declared Wahl. "Then, after I went with (supervising 
producer) David Burke to see 'Speed-the-Plow,' we got to talking about Ron 
Silver (as the son). We got real lucky." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Wahl doesn't just show up on the set. 
</P>
<P>
"It would get rather dull and boring if you were just saying lines," said Wahl 
-- who came up with the story for next week's episode (the first of a 
two-parter), in which the late Sonny Steelgrave -- made infamous by Ray 
Sharkey's performance -- returns in dream sequences. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Wahl is obsessive about the series and his character. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about a fleeting moment in one of this season's early episodes, in which 
Vinnie hands a young man a volume of Mark Twain and urges him to read it 
(C'mon, are we expected to believe that Vinnie's read Mark Twain?), Wahl shot 
back, "Maybe it's a book he wishes he'd read. Maybe he had to do other things 
-- and didn't have the time to read it. OK?" 
</P>
<P>
When a distraught Vinnie dropped out of the OCB (and, basically, life), Wahl 
decided to grow long hair and a beard (and dress even scruffier than usual). 
Not exactly in keeping with the prevailing network mentality about leading men, 
laughed Wahl. "They were kind of thrown when I came up with that one." 
</P>
<P>
Wahl also argued for Vinnie's right to tell his mother about his undercover 
work. "I felt that he needed some kind of connection with somebody who he 
derives happiness from. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, there were no rewards for Vinnie. Everything was about him just 
doing his job and endangering his life. And there was no payback . . . and I 
was bitching and moaning that Vinnie's got to have something to be happy about. 
Otherwise, he'd say 'to hell with this job -- I quit!" 
</P>
<P>
"Wiseguy," which airs Wednedays on CBS, is like no other crime show. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, there are those dicey story lines. And florid scripts. (If you 
don't pay attention, you can miss entire plot points.) And there are production 
values that defy TV's frantic production pace. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, there are the audacious and dangerously seductive bad guys/gals 
who saunter through the story "arcs." (On "Wiseguy," most stories span four or 
more episodes -- creating "arcs.") 
</P>
<P>
A Rogue's Gallery 
</P>
<P>
From mob boss Sonny Steelgrave to those incestuous, drug-dealing siblings Mel 
and Susan Profitt (played by Kevin Spacey and Joan Severance) to hustler/white 
supremacist spokesman Knox Pooley (played by Watergate lawyer (!) Fred 
Thompson), "Wiseguy" has let loose a crazy, creepy, spell-binding rogue's 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
And it promises to grow: Look for Deidre Hall -- best known for playing 
sweetheart-types -- to go "over the edge" (according to a series source), "as 
you've never seen her before," in an upcoming seven-episode arc about 
corruption in the music industry. To get under way March 1, the story boasts 
the unlikely casting of Glenn Frey, Deborah Harry, Tim Curry, Paul Winfield, 
Mick Fleetwood and Patty D'Arbanville. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that Vinnie sometimes seems like a visitor to his own series. 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, he's the show's core. Wahl is so much the core of the show that 
his presence was felt even in the recent episodes that went Wahl-less (because 
the actor took time off to allow an ankle injury to heal). Those episodes -- 
with Lewis/Silver -- found Anthony Denison as another OCB agent subbing for an 
"injured" Vinnie. In the end, Denison caved in to what must be Vinnie's wildest 
nightmare: He cracked in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Vinnie/Wahl, the word that comes up most often among the 
"Wiseguy" creative folks is vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
Said series director Rob Iscove: "Vinnie's not afraid to show that he's torn -- 
that he's vulnerable. He faces the same moral dilemmas we all do. For Vinnie, 
the world isn't defined in terms of black and white." 
</P>
<P>
Said co-executive producer Les Sheldon: "Here's a character who grew up on the 
East Coast in the same neighborhood as, say, Sonny Steelgrave. Maybe, because 
he had a slightly more stable home life, he took a left turn and Sonny took a 
right. What I'm saying is that he can relate to these people that he's been 
thrown in with. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows that he could have been one of them." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about Vinnie," said Wahl, "is that he's constantly being tested. 
He's very real, in that you never know what he's going to do. I think that's 
what the audience likes about him." 
</P>
<P>
Many female viewers also might admit to liking the show simply because of the 
tall, dark and ruggedly handsome Wahl. 
</P>
<P>
(Billboards touting the show boast a massive picture of Wahl, accompanied by 
the words: If looks could kill.) 
</P>
<P>
Wahl shrugs off hunk-status talk: "I have crooked teeth. I only got one 
eyebrow. (Wahl won't tweeze those hairs that make his eyebrows appear to 
merge.) My mouth is crooked. My nose is crooked. Everything about me is 
crooked." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I like to think that if I have appeal, it's because I have heart." 
</P>
<P>
Wahl was 19 when he decided to chuck a job at an auto parts warehouse and try 
acting. He applied -- with hundreds of others -- for a chance to read for "The 
Wanderers." 
</P>
<P>
Remembered Wahl: "I didn't bring in a resume. I didn't have a list of credits a 
mile long, back to when I played the grape in the third-grade school play. I 
just said, 'Please give me a chance -- I think I can do the job for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
He wound up doing "a little two- or three-minute screen test," and getting the 
part. Philip Kaufman's 1979 film -- about Bronx high schoolers (and gang 
members) in the early '60s -- has since acquired cult status. Wahl has since 
racked up eight film credits. 
</P>
<P>
"Jinxed," the movie Wahl did with Bette Midler, didn't sell tickets, but it did 
make headlines during filming, when Wahl and director Don Siegel didn't jibe 
with the volatile actress/singer. ("Don't you think the screen just lit up when 
we were together," quipped Wahl.) 
</P>
<P>
"Fort Apache, The Bronx," teamed Wahl with Paul Newman. "Nothing shabby about 
making a movie with Paul Newman," surmised Wahl. He teamed with Cheryl Ladd for 
the wartime-romantic drama, "Purple Hearts." "It turned out pretty sappy," said 
Wahl, "but I was happy to do it because I got to play a doctor and not a New 
York street guy. It was nice to get to play an educated person." 
</P>
<P>
He's done a few heavy artillery-action pictures. And a short-lived series 
opposite Billy Dee Williams. "I had a lean year there. I needed the money. I 
wasn't sorry when it ('Double Dare') got canceled. It was pretty dumb." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't looking to do another series when the "Wiseguy" offer came along. 
"But I wasn't in a position to not check it out." 
</P>
<P>
Wahl wanted to know: Could a reporter mention some of the crew members "who 
never get any attention." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? Director of photography Frank E. Johnson. Camera operator Cam 
MacDonald. Janet Ulmer ("she does my hair"). Personal assistant Kenna 
Marshall-Pitman. Driver Terry Newton. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the show's cast and crew is "real tight," Wahl said, "that 
really makes it easier when you're filming away from home." 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Vancouver has all the natural splendor. Trees and mountains and all 
that. If you're into hiking, I guess it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
As for the night life. "It's pretty beat here. But on Saturday nights, I go 
hear Jimmy Burns play." 
</P>
<P>
Burns, one of the series co-stars (he plays Lifeguard), is also a musician who 
regularly plays gigs around town. 
</P>
<P>
"I get in free. You think I'm gonna pass that up?" 
</P>
<P>
Spoken like a regular guy.

A PRECEDENT-SETTING CASE BETWEEN ARTISTS AND CORPORATE AMERICA IS SCHEDULED 
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT

<P>
Who owns the copyright to an artwork -- the artist who created it or the group 
that commissioned it? 
</P>
<P>
The question will be answered in an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court case that could 
be a bonanza for free-lance creators and a disaster for business. 
</P>
<P>
Community for Creative Nonviolence vs. Reid may sound like a street fight 
between an advocacy group for the homeless and a sculptor from Baltimore. But 
the argument over who owns the copyright to James Earl Reid's socially critical 
Nativity scene, "Third World America," is shaping up as a battle between the 
creative and corporate forces of America. 
</P>
<P>
The case involves a cast-polymer-and-fiberglass, life-size sculpture that 
depicts a homeless family seeking warmth on a steam grate. Instead of 
portraying a traditional Holy Family, Reid has created a creche of street 
people: a mother, father and baby who keep their belongings in a shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
The Community for Creative Nonviolence, headed by Mitch Snyder, an advocate for 
the homeless, commissioned the piece for Washington's 1985 Christmas 
celebration, Pageant of Peace. The two parties didn't sign a contract but 
agreed that Snyder's group would pay as much as $15,000 for materials and the 
artist would donate his time and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
A legal dispute over the copyright to "Third World America" erupted when the 
group wanted to send Reid's sculpture on tour and published pictures of it on 
greeting cards and calendars to raise funds for the homeless. The 46-year-old 
artist says he is sympathetic to problems of the homeless -- and his donated 
time supports that contention -- but he believes that the reproductions 
misrepresent his work and that profits from reproductions of his work are 
rightfully his. Snyder contends that Reid became greedy when he saw an 
opportunity for profit, but Reid says he is simply trying to support his own 
family. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that 
Snyder's group, which owns the sculpture, must share the copyright with Reid. 
Snyder appealed to the Supreme Court, which plans to hear oral arguments for 
the case in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, arts advocacy groups have lined up behind Reid, while major 
publishers and computer companies have weighed in for Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
On Snyder's side are Time Inc., the New York Times, the Magazine Publishers 
Assn., the Hearst Corp., Information Industry Assn., Computer and Business 
Equipment Manufacturers Assn. (representing Eastman Kodak Co., NCR Corp. and 
Apple Computer Inc.) and Intellectual Property Owners Inc. (a trade association 
that includes IBM, Dow Chemical Co. and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing). In 
general, these groups argue in briefs filed with the Supreme Court that a 
decision for Reid would stifle their creativity and flexibility in working with 
free lancers. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting Reid are about 50 groups of artists, writers and arts advocates such 
as Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts, Copyright Justice Coalition, Graphic Artists 
Guild and Advertising Photographers of America. A Washington-based group called 
Artists and Writers Copyright Committee: The James Earl Reid Legal Defense Fund 
has been organized to raise money for Reid's legal expenses, expected to total 
about $70,000 to $80,000. But the most significant development, according to 
Joshua Kaufman, Reid's attorney, is that the solicitor general has filed a 
brief on behalf of Reid. The Supreme Court often follows the solicitor 
general's viewpoint in difficult cases involving federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Why such a high-profile fuss? And why has a citizens' action group allied with 
corporate giants? It all boils down to economics. 
</P>
<P>
If the court rules in favor of Snyder, commissioners of free-lance artists, 
photographers, writers and computer program designers will probably continue to 
control copyrights to free-lance work -- and reap profits from reproductions of 
it. If Reid wins, free-lance creators stand to gain those profits for 
themselves. Estimates of the potential loss to business -- and gain for artists 
-- run as high as $43 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting development," said Los Angeles attorney Gregory Victoroff, a 
specialist in arts copyright law who often lectures on the subject, conducts 
biweekly copyright clinics for California Lawyers for the Arts and has compiled 
a practical guide book, "The Visual Artist's Manual," published by the 
Committee for the Arts of the Beverly Hills Bar Assn. Barristers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most important artists' rights case of the decade," said Robert 
Bedard, director of ArtPac, a Washington-based group that lobbies for 
legislation in support of artists. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman went one step further, declaring, "This is probably the single most 
important philosophical and financial issue to confront artists" in many years. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in Community for Creative Nonviolence vs. Reid is the "work for hire" 
doctrine in the Copyright Act of 1976. The doctrine is considered the law's 
major "pitfall" for artists by Tad Crawford, author of "The Visual Artist's 
Guide to the New Copyright Law." The act stipulates that an employer or other 
commissioning party owns the copyright in a "work for hire" situation as if he 
were the creator of the work. (In the pending Supreme Court case, Snyder 
contends that he directed the creation of the sculpture and is therefore 
entitled to be considered its creator, while Reid dismisses the claim as 
absurd.) 
</P>
<P>
According to the act, "work for hire" is work done under a contract that gives 
the copyright to the employer, but in practice many artists have effectively 
relinquished copyrights without signing such contracts. Kaufman estimates that 
95% of commissioned free-lance work is done without contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"An artist's copyright comes into existence at the moment of creation," 
Victoroff said. "In the case of a photograph, that moment occurs when the 
picture is developed and fixed in a tangible medium in which it can be visually 
perceived. For an employer to get the copyright from the artist, he must have 
one of two things: a written 'work for hire' contract (whereby the artist 
relinquishes the copyright to the employer) or an employment situation in which 
the employer pays the artist a salary, takes out withholding tax and provides 
workman's compensation insurance, disability insurance and all the good things 
of formal employment. 
</P>
<P>
"But it doesn't work that way in real life. Artists are mostly free lance and 
in the past they have been triple losers: they haven't had contracts, fringe 
benefits or copyrights," Victoroff said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent case in Los Angeles has led Reid to believe that the legal wind may be 
blowing his way. The U.S. 9th District Court of Appeals last month ruled that 
the late Patrick Nagel's estate owns copyrights to four sets of lithographs 
produced as a promotional campaign for ITT Cannon and stopped a publisher's 
attempt to produce poster editions of the prints. 
</P>
<P>
The 1979 "promotional giveaway was less than successful," and ITT Cannon "was 
left with many extra sets of lithographs," according to the Jan. 17 Daily 
Appellate Report. Stefan Gommerman, owner of the Eva and Steve Dorog Gallery in 
Los Angeles, in 1985 bought the remaining prints from ITT Cannon along with 
copyrights. 
</P>
<P>
Preparing to publish one of the lithographs as a poster, Gommerman registered a 
copyright. But Nagel's widow, Jennifer Dumas, contended that Nagel had been an 
independent contractor and retained ownership of the copyrights. Dumas filed a 
conflicting copyright and sued for damages and infringement. The court granted 
Dumas an injunction and restrained Gommerman from reproducing Nagel's 
lithographs. 
</P>
<P>
The decision states that Nagel did not create the art as "work for hire" 
because he was not an employee of the company, according to the Copyright Act 
of 1976. The court decided that a commission is "work for hire" only if it is 
done by a salaried employee or the artist has signed a written agreement to 
"work for hire." 
</P>
<P>
According to Victoroff, there's another aspect to the "work for hire" issue 
that may benefit artists in California. "If employers get real smart and decide 
to use 'work for hire' contracts, under California law the artist can take 
advantage of a fantastic provision, Section 686 of the labor code. According to 
this law, anyone who commissions an artist under a 'work for hire' contract is 
automatically defined as an employer, and if he is an employer he is obligated 
to provide all kinds of benefits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Victoroff also pointed out Section 203 which imposes penalties on employers who 
do not promptly pay terminated employees. He said he had used the provision to 
start investigations and effect settlements involving free lancers but that 
many labor commissioners were unaware of the law or were not using it to full 
extent possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free-Lance Difficulties 
</P>
<P>
American artists who do free-lance work outside the country may have special 
difficulty with copyrights, Victoroff said. For example, an artist who made a 
deal with a fine-art publisher to reproduce 400 copies of his paintings and 
display them in a chain of hotels in the Far East recently discovered that the 
publisher actually churned out and distributed thousands -- possibly tens of 
thousands -- of reproductions. The unidentified artist probably has no recourse 
because the works were produced in a part of the world that does not conform to 
international copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
Artists' copyrights are effective for the life of the artist plus 50 years. 
That seems clear enough, but disputes are common. While the concept of "work 
for hire" has only recently come into artists' parlance, copyright issues 
involving the principles of "fair use" and "moral rights" are more familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"Fair use" of copyrighted material allows certain noncommercial uses without 
the artist's permission, such as incorporating a small part of someone else's 
art in an otherwise original work or reproducing an artwork to illustrate 
criticism, commentary, instruction or research. "Moral rights" refers to 
artists' rights to be credited for their work and to prevent its destruction or 
reproduction in distorted form. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, artists, publishers and manufacturers have all appeared to be 
villains in copyright infringements. 
</P>
<P>
Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" had long since passed into the public domain 
before Marcel Duchamp gave her a mustache, but art borrowers are not always 
scrupulous about their uses of others' images. 
</P>
<P>
New York artist Sherrie Levine made a name for herself as an "appropriationist" 
in part by photographing Edward Weston's photographs of nudes and displaying 
them as her own work. This piracy was embraced by critics-in-the-know as a 
timely challenge to the concept of originality, but Weston's fans were not 
amused. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in 
Tucson, which acquired Edward Weston's estate and copyrights to his work, 
didn't charge Levine with copyright infringement, however. "We would never do 
that to an artist," said the center's Nancy Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
Some artists fail to protect their own copyrights. Salvador Dali sold 
copyrights to many of his prints produced in the final decades of his life, 
thus opening the floodgates to a torrent of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Living artists retain copyrights to their works in museum collections and these 
rights pass to their estates for 50 years after death. Museums generally 
control reproductions of older works in their collections by copyrighting 
photographs of them and selling reproduction rights on a case-by-case basis, 
but the system isn't fail-safe. An endless array of parodies of Grant Wood's 
"American Gothic" is apparently the result of the Art Institute of Chicago's 
failure many years ago to protect the copyright of the painting, which is in 
its collection. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure how the parodies came about, but we have never litigated on 
them," said Lyn Delliquadri, the museum's director of graphics and 
reproductions."At this point I think most art historians feel that all of the 
send-ups are part of the history of the painting."

LEARNING COPYRIGHT LAWS

Most art piracy cases never reach the courts because infringement is difficult 
to prove or artists can't afford expensive lawsuits. Admirers of the late 
Lorser Feitelson's paintings, for example, have noted a similarity between his 
"lineform" abstractions and the twisted ribbon-like design on Coca-Cola cans, 
but the likeness has never been legally challenged. Neither has the similarity 
between one of Matt Mullican's images and the logo on Max Studio clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Such situations seem to be part and parcel of the creative world, but in an 
increasingly complex and litigious society, artists are finding that the only 
way to protect their income, their art and credit for their work is to get 
smarter about copyright law. 
</P>
<P>
California Lawyers for the Arts aims to aid that effort. The nonprofit 
organization, with offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, offers copyright 
clinics as a regular part of its services which include other educational 
programs, lawyer referrals, book publishing and a resource center. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists are an under-represented minority. They're not getting the information 
they should have on copyrights and other issues, but it's hard to reach them," 
said Gregory Victoroff. "California Lawyers for the Arts now has an office that 
artists can walk into, a place where they can become aware of their rights so 
don't have to run to a high-priced lawyer every time they have a little 
copyright problem." 
</P>
<P>
Biweekly copyright clinics are scheduled on the second and fourth Saturdays of 
each month of this year (except March 25, May 27, Nov. 25 and Dec. 23). The Los 
Angeles location is 315 W. 9th St., Suite 1101; (213) 623-8311). San Francisco 
clinics are at Ft. Mason Center, Building C, Room 255; (415) 775-7200. 
</P>
<P>
Cost for drop-in consultations between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. is $10 for 
members of California Lawyers for the Arts, $20 for nonmembers. The Beverly 
Hills Bar Assn. also offers one-day courses in copyright law. Information:

JAZZ: GROVER HITS HIS GROOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are unusual times for Grover Washington Jr. His most recent album, "Then 
and Now" (Columbia CCK 44256), stands at No. 8 on the Billboard charts after a 
25-week run that has seen it reach No. 2. (It was No. 1 for six weeks in 
R&amp;R Magazine's airplay listings.) 
</P>
<P>
What is uncommon about this is that Washington, for whom a place on the 
Billboard pop charts has been the customary situation, is now on the jazz chart 
-- not the so-called contemporary jazz list, but the regular jazz roster that 
places him alongside Charlie Parker and Diane Schuur. 
</P>
<P>
The sales of "Then and Now" may not be spectacular, but the contents have been 
pleasing both to Washington and to those whose interests are in straight-ahead 
jazz. Along with loose, spontaneous solos by the leader and strong support by 
his regular sidemen, there are guest appearances, both as players and 
composers, by Herbie Hancock, Tommy Flanagan and Ron Carter. 
</P>
<P>
A little-known detail is the involvement of Igor Butman, a Soviet saxophonist 
and longtime fan of Washington's, with whom he jammed during his idol's tour of 
the U.S.S.R. Butman later married an American and moved to Boston in 1987. He 
is prominently featured on "Then and Now," duetting with Washington on "Stella 
by Starlight" and playing a Butman original, "French Connections." 
</P>
<P>
As these details make clear, this is beyond doubt a record of unusual interest, 
which even the stubbornest of jazz purists can appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, despite (or perhaps because of) the great commercial success 
that earned him gold and platinum records through carefully planned sessions 
aimed at the contemporary/fusion market, Washington has been the victim of 
negative reviews by critics who tend to be suspicious of anyone whose sales 
have led to extraordinary financial security. 
</P>
<P>
Some writers have ignored him; others have accused him of bastardizing his 
music, a charge he finds not only hurtful but also quite untrue. Of course, the 
conventional wisdom among artists who have to endure these slings and arrows is 
that critics are insignificant onlookers whose views are of no concern to them; 
but beneath that attitude the performer may harbor a deep resentment that will 
never go away. 
</P>
<P>
So it was when Grover Washington Jr. read a review under this byline some years 
ago, predicting inaccurately and intemperately that the saxophonist would not 
even be a footnote in American music. Reached last week at his home outside 
Philadelphia, he engaged in an enlightening conversation about his values, past 
and present. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't ever operated under false pretenses," he said. "I knew all along 
that I wanted to play different kinds of music." 
</P>
<P>
On being told that "Then and Now" met with at least one critic's approval, he 
said: "Well, thank you. It's nice to know that you like one album out of the 
20." 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Washington had been trying for about 10 years to make a record 
along the lines of "Then and Now." As he explained, "The record companies I was 
with just didn't think they were ready to market a product of this kind; but 
when I signed with CBS a couple of years ago, I had it written into my contract 
that I could do this." 
</P>
<P>
In the future, he added, he plans to rotate, continuing along the contemporary 
lines but incorporating here and there some mainstream material. 
</P>
<P>
He may be expected to adhere to this policy when he appears June 17 in the 
annual Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl. At a previous Bowl concert, 
he shared billing with Stan Getz and recalls that "Stan and I had a great 
time." For the finale, the two joined forces on "Mr. Magic." (Ironically, it 
was Getz who suggested that Washington hit; Grover would have preferred to play 
"Stella by Starlight.") 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that equal results were possible for his contemporary projects and 
albums such as "Then and Now," would he divide his time equally between the 
two? 
</P>
<P>
"You mean, between a 'Strawberry Moon' type album and 'Then and Now'? Well, 
first of all, there was nothing equal about these records. The budget for 'Then 
and Now' was a great deal smaller, and we did it all live in a relatively short 
space of time. In fact, all the tunes released are first or second takes; the 
only reason we didn't use the first takes was that they ran a little too long. 
There was no overdubbing at all, and the enjoyment, the good feeling and the 
spontaneity really came through the grooves." 
</P>
<P>
This does not necessarily invalidate the more complicated procedure in 
producing a "Winelight" or a "Strawberry Moon." Such records have to be 
assembled layer-cake style; as Washington pointed out, there may be as many as 
seven musicians in the rhythm section alone, whose diverse roles must be worked 
out separately and with great care. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be in the studio three whole days just trying to get one track 
completed in such a way that nothing will clash," Washington said. "So you do 
these things on an individual basis, and then in the final result everything 
will go hand in glove." 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary credits aside, Washington's background offers a reminder of his 
wealth of experiences, ranging from R&amp;B groups to Army bands and organ 
trios. In 1971 came the turning point: He was booked for a record date with the 
tenor saxophonist Hank Crawford, but when Crawford failed to show, Washington 
was assigned by producer Creed Taylor to take over for what became his first 
session as a leader. The record, "Inner City Blues," was a blockbuster, leading 
to the formation of his own traveling band and a long series of hits, among 
which "Mr. Magic" was the first to reach the top spot on several charts. 
</P>
<P>
He does not intend to remain identified with any single image. "My next album 
will be a contemporary one that you probably won't listen to, but you never can 
tell what the one after that may be. I want to do some big-band things, 
symphonic things, a saxophone quartet date; and I want to bring back the organ 
trio, a format that has been grossly neglected in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"My objective is to put each project together like a collection of short 
stories, hoping that the tales I tell will be something anyone can enjoy. In 
fact, I just want to play the best music I can in any area. It's as simple as 
that."

'LIFERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Sandi Sodolski ever wins the lottery, she says, she's heading off to Italy 
to see the real Il Vittoriale. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the ultimate "Tamara" fan has accumulated 36 visits to her favorite 
play. A health researcher at USC Medical School, the 46-year-old Sodolski has 
written fan letters to the show's producers, sent flowers to its actors and 
been photographed chained to Il Vittoriale's front door (to promote the play). 
She organized an evening for "lifers" -- "Tamara" fans of four visits or more 
who are allowed in free on weeknights when they bring a paying friend. The 
event included stylish "lifer" buttons and a 62-question "Tamara" quiz. 
</P>
<P>
Close to 300 people have become "lifers" -- lifetime members of the D'Annunzio 
household. Producers offer discounts on the second, third and fourth visits as 
well and estimate that at least 10% of audience members are there on repeat 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
But, within the cult of "Tamara," few fans rival Sodolski. When she heard in 
June, 1987, that the show was closing -- another false alarm -- she rushed 
petitions in the mail to fellow "lifers" in an attempt to dissuade the show's 
producers. Her effort was, in fact, the inspiration for 18-year-old UCLA 
student Samantha Fein, who has seen the show 32 times. Fein and three friends 
have recently accumulated nearly 1,000 signatures on a petition to stop the 
latest closure threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if (the show's producers) know how important 'Tamara' is to us 
and the city of Los Angeles," Fein said just before the latest extension was 
announced. "It's part of the excitement and uniqueness of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
For Fein, it's the staging. For systems analyst Linda Butrick, who has seen the 
show four times to her daughter Laurie's five times, it's discovering new 
subplots and visiting with the cast after the show. And for Russ Silberman, a 
29-year-old restaurant manager who's seen the show about eight times, it's the 
challenge of 10 visits so he can follow each of the 10 characters. Admitting 
his addiction to books like Frank Herbert's "Dune" series or Piers Anthony's 
"Xanth" series, Silberman says simply, " I'm a nut for completeness." 
</P>
<P>
Artist Teresa Romeu saw it 13 times before her friendships with cast members 
resulted in her hearing about, then getting, a job as a champagne server or 
"wench." Made head wench three months later, she went on to become the show's 
food and beverage manager and, eventually, to paint reproductions of de 
Lempicka paintings that today hang in producer Znaimer's New York apartment. 
</P>
<P>
And the ordinary first-timer? Despite the pretty-average-looking cars in the 
parking lot, random chats one recent Friday evening found nobody regretting the 
$70 expenditure. There were some criticisms -- Youngstown, Ohio, 
gastroenterologist Dr. David Brown felt he couldn't get emotionally involved, 
while his wife, Judy, called it "a little on the gimmicky side." But CPA 
Richard Kaufman, whose wife, Barbara, gave him two tickets for Christmas, felt 
it was well worth the money. "You're right there. You have to pick up the story 
yourself. It's not fed to you." 
</P>
<P>
Lifer Sodolski says the show still transports her: "I am always amazed that I'm 
still in Los Angeles (after seeing the play). I will be so disappointed if I 
ever see Il Vittoriale and it doesn't look like this place."

POLICE BLAME EXPLOSION IN CRIME, POPULATION FOR DROP IN SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Burgreen recently visited the police Communications Division to watch 
dispatchers field calls for service. It was a Thursday afternoon, about 5:30, a 
quiet time, when workers are headed home and the biggest police emergency you 
would expect would be a traffic jam on Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief asked the dispatchers to "bring up all of the available units" 
-- in other words, to tell him exactly how many officers were free at that 
moment to handle emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
With perhaps 120 units on duty on a typical weekday afternoon, Burgreen 
expected quite a few to be available to respond. To his dismay, the computer 
showed that the vast majority of them would have to be pulled from other calls 
to respond immediately. 
</P>
<P>
When Burgreen looked at the screen, only four available units lit up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharp Drop in Service 
</P>
<P>
The level of service provided by the San Diego Police Department has dropped 
sharply over the past decade, police say. 
</P>
<P>
It is the result of a dramatic change in the amount and kind of crime in San 
Diego, a city that has grown so fast that it now faces many of the same urban 
pathologies of other major cities in the United States. Although the number of 
officers in the department has increased with the explosive population growth 
of the city, each officer is responding to more calls than ever. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has prompted top commanders to begin meeting to consider shifting 
more officers back onto the streets. Next month, the police, the city manager 
and the City Council are expected to open formal discussions on a proposed tax 
increase to pay for more street cops. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more police officers in this city," Burgreen said. "I am not satisfied 
with the kind of job we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
He and other police experts from around the country agree that increasing the 
number of officers will not automatically reduce the crime rate or solve the 
problems of urban crime, whose roots may be in drugs and deeply embedded social 
ills. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen also maintains that there is no crisis in police manpower in San 
Diego. Homicides and other major crimes are still being investigated. Officers 
are almost always available to respond to top-priority emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
But police say there has been a demonstrable decline in police service, and it 
can be seen in these key areas: 
</P>
<P>
* Officers in the seven patrol divisions are spending well over half to 
two-thirds of their day responding to calls for service and writing reports. 
Police administrators in San Diego would like to see officers spend an even 50% 
of their day responding to calls, and the other half investigating crimes and 
performing prevention duties. That level of service has not been provided in 
San Diego in a dozen years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
* Response times have risen to the point where the average officer last year 
needed more than seven minutes to arrive at a high-priority emergency call -- a 
situation where even a few seconds can mean the difference between life and 
death. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the northern patrol areas, the response time hit well over eight 
minutes. A citywide, five-minute response time average is the eventual goal of 
the department, but that figure has not been met in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
* Each month, more than 1,000 reported crimes, particularly burglary and grand 
theft, which affect the most victims, are shelved because detectives simply do 
not have the time to work the cases. 
</P>
<P>
That means countless police calls for home burglaries, car vandalism and other 
routine crimes are not being investigated. Instead, light-duty officers sitting 
at telephone banks are merely taking reports whose only real purpose is for 
insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
Police would like to see a 50% clearance rate on these crimes. But, as in the 
other categories, that expectation hasn't been met in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Waiting Outside Jail 
</P>
<P>
Other major problems drain police manpower. Officers on all three shifts spend 
long periods lined up outside the crowded County Jail downtown, waiting to book 
prisoners. The false-alarm rate is continuing to rise, and officers are losing 
thousands of man-hours each year responding to bogus calls. And the ranks in 
the Police Reserve program, once a dependable source of backup help, are 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
To many in the Police Department and on the City Council, the solution lies in 
hiring more officers and trying to saturate the streets by putting the new 
recruits out in the community. 
</P>
<P>
But law enforcement experts outside San Diego caution that merely adding police 
won't automatically reduce the crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, adding more police may in fact overload the criminal justice 
system and cause judges to let more people out faster," said Hubert Williams, 
president of the Police Foundation, a Washington-based, nonprofit organization 
that supports innovation and improvement in police work. 
</P>
<P>
"That can happen if you think police are the end-all to reducing crime." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the manpower shortcomings can be felt on the streets of San Diego, where 
many of the laws that were being enforced 10 years ago are passed over by 
police today. 
</P>
<P>
Patrol Sgt. Mark T. Dallezotte worries about prostitution on El Cajon 
Boulevard, but he can't spare the men to help the undercover detectives in the 
vice unit. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell us that they'll do all the paper work on the arrests if we just 
transport the prostitutes to jail," he said. "But I have to tell them no. I 
don't have the manpower." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jack Lilly sees signs that black and Latino gangs are warring over a new 
battleground downtown. Yet he recently had to turn loose 12 young Latino gang 
members after they were stopped at Horton Plaza and questioned about a rash of 
stabbings. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do with them," he said. "They'll stay out into the wee 
hours, but what can we do? I guess we could enforce the curfew, but that would 
take too many officers out of service." 
</P>
<P>
And Officer Charles Belletti, like most of his colleagues, knows that whenever 
he drives out of the police station, the dispatcher will have a list of old 
calls waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you how shorthanded we are," he said. "Go over to the dispatch 
center and look at the stack of unanswered calls. She'll have two pages' worth, 
and as soon as we report in-service, she's asking us how many we can take." 
</P>
<P>
The rise in crime in San Diego over the past 10 years is startling. 
</P>
<P>
There were 1.7 million calls for service last year, almost double the number a 
decade ago. Homicides have risen 112%. Aggravated assaults are up 238%, auto 
thefts 248%. 
</P>
<P>
Those kinds of increases can be felt at all levels, even in the dispatchers' 
room. Where 10 years ago emergency calls were answered within 2.4 seconds, the 
average citizen calling for help today will have to wait while the phone rings 
for 22 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the number of police officers in San Diego has risen as well. There 
are 1,705 sworn officers, an increase of almost 600 from a decade ago. The 
police budget has gone from $35.2 million 10 years ago to $128 million today. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan approved by the City Council, the formula for obtaining new 
officers is tagged to the population. For the past several years, the 
department has been allowed to hire 1.62 officers for every 1,000 new city 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The council has talked about raising that level to 2.0 officers per 1,000, 
which would mean 440 new officers. Next month police administrators and City 
Manager John Lockwood will present to the council a detailed financial plan for 
a tax proposal to raise the money for more officers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Obsolete Already 
</P>
<P>
But many police administrators are already concerned that the 2.0 figure is 
obsolete and that 2.5 is a more realistic goal if the department truly wants to 
return to its level of service 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
City projections show that raising the level to 2.0 would cost $62 million. And 
to get to 2.5 officers, the cost would be about $130 million the first year and 
$110 million for each year after that, all on top of the department's current 
operating expenses, Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see that kind of money lying around," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts caution that voters may be fooling themselves if they think the answer 
to their problems is to raise taxes and hire more officers. Police response 
times may come down, and more officers may be freed to conduct crime-prevention 
duties, but a real decrease in the raw numbers of reported crimes would be 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, of the Police Foundation, noted that New York added 5,000 officers 
some years ago, yet saw no reduction in the number of reported crimes. "Arrests 
increased significantly, but so did the crime rate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said police administrators should instead identify their specific problems, 
such as gangs and drugs, and then move large numbers of existing and new 
officers into those hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
"It needs to be made emphatically clear to the public that the police are out 
there controlling the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Feeley of the Center for Study of Law and Society at the University of 
California, Berkeley, said it may be unwise to predicate police staffing needs 
merely on the number of local residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unreasonable to say we want to have a good number of officers per 
capita," he said. "But I would urge the City Council to study other cities and 
see how they get by." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is the seventh-largest city in the nation and ranks ninth in the 
number of officers per capita. Traditional high-crime cities have much higher 
ratios, with Detroit at 4.51 per 1,000 and New York at 3.91. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is the second-largest city in California, but ranks sixth in the 
number of officers per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Police Department's management say part of the problem is that 
too many sworn officers have been taken out of uniform over the past 10 years 
and put into desk jobs. Cmdr. Cal Krosch declined to provide figures on the 
number of officers in uniform as opposed to handling administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
But, in an attempt to reverse the decline in service, Burgreen and the top 
members of his staff have been meeting recently to consider ways to move some 
desk officers out of their suits and ties and back into uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Burgreen has disbanded the 24-hour front-counter operation. Beyond 
that step, administrators don't always agree on which other units should be 
sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief Ken Fortier has suggested freeing up some officers by thinning out 
the Crime Stoppers, gun desk, public affairs, video-graphics, training, 
personnel and inspection and control units. 
</P>
<P>
Krosch suggested eliminating the Horse Patrol instead. "If I had my way," he 
said, "I'd do away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Horse Patrol is a favorite of the City Council, and, whenever council 
members discuss police priorities, they often speak in glowing terms about 
officers riding through Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen declined to say which units he favors scrapping or thinning, but he 
did say that major changes will be made within the next month. "We're going 
through every position within the department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50-50 Ratio Sought 
</P>
<P>
One of the chief's greatest concerns is that officers in each patrol division 
are spending well over 50% of their day simply responding to calls for service, 
and much less time on pro-active work -- activities not in response to calls, 
including follow-up and crime-prevention duties. 
</P>
<P>
In the high-crime areas, officers assigned to the Eastern Division spent 69% of 
their time in the last four months of 1988 "out of service," which means 
handling calls or paper work and unavailable to respond, and in the 
Southeastern Division the ratio was 67%. 
</P>
<P>
Officials would like to hit a 50-50 goal, which Fortier said was last reached 
about 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said the average officer responds to 10 to 15 calls during every 
10-hour shift. "But you don't solve outstanding crimes by running from radio 
call to radio call," he said. "The only way you prevent crime is through 
pro-active police work." 
</P>
<P>
Feeley, of UC Berkeley, agreed. "It's a terrific objective," he said. "A lot of 
police work is being responsive to the community." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police also would like to shave three minutes off their overall 
emergency response times, and begin arriving at crime scenes within an average 
of five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Couldn't Do That Now' 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Kenneth Moller of Field Operations recalled a time in the late 1950s when 
every type of call was answered promptly. "If an elderly man fell out of bed, 
and his wife called, we went by and helped him back up," Moller said. "But we 
couldn't do that now. We don't have the time." 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, police aren't even coming close. Denise Lavell, a member of the 
Civilian Advisory Panel on Police Practices, has ridden with officers in every 
section of the city. She said that overworked officers routinely arrive late to 
some medium-priority calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I have literally been in the car when there have been calls that were half an 
hour old," she said. "Even 40 minutes old." 
</P>
<P>
With each officer handling more crimes, more follow-up investigations are being 
shelved. Robbery and burglarly detectives are inundated with cases. 
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show there were 974 residential robberies in September, 67% 
of which were shelved or received little investigative attention. There were 
375 commercial burglaries, 53% of which were shelved, and 533 cases of grand 
theft, 74% of which were shelved. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be a detective came out when your car was vandalized," said Lt. Lou 
Scanlon, who heads the investigations in the Southeastern station. "That never 
happens anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Many False Alarms 
</P>
<P>
Police are concerned about other issues affecting manpower as well. 
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of 1988, there were nearly 27,000 false-alarm 
dispatches. The average time required for each alarm call is 26 minutes, which 
means 11,557 man-hours were lost. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said he plans to present several recommendations to the city manager 
within the next couple of months, including not responding to burglar alarms 
unless a private security guard has first determined that a crime occurred, and 
levying a user fee on alarm owners. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reserve officer strength is dwindling, mostly because new training 
requirements have turned off many would-be volunteers. Sgt. Charles Woodruff 
said there are only 114 active police reserves today, down from about 300 in 
the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen, although conceding that the reserves have been a source of support in 
the past, said he is reconsidering whether the program is still worthwhile, 
especially since police work today "has become a very, very specialized field." 
</P>
<P>
With more calls coming in every day, dispatchers are sending more crime victims 
to the Telephone Report Unit. That means victims give information to light-duty 
officers over the phone, and seldom see any follow-up investigation. Last year, 
more than 40,000 reports were taken by phone. Police say that's a far cry from 
the old days, when officers tried to answer all types of calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, if somebody steals your garden hose, you're going to call and talk 
to an officer who will make a report," Burgreen said. "But you'll never see an 
officer. And that's a deterioration in the level of service."

A LOOK BENEATH 'YET ANOTHER' LAWSUIT REVEALS GOOD GOVERNMENT AT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY EPP, Jeffrey Epp is senior deputy city attorney for Escondido. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In November, the cities of Escondido, Carlsbad and Encinitas sued the County of 
San Diego, challenging the secretive manner in which it was conducting contract 
negotiations for the proposed San Marcos trash-to-energy plant. To those weary 
of litigation against the plant, the lawsuit was just another example of people 
using the court process to stop something they simply did not like. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, it seemed as if tax dollars were being used for three public 
agencies to bring a lawsuit, and tax dollars were being used for another public 
agency to defend it. At first glance, it appeared that the real loser here 
wasn't so much the trash-to-energy plant but the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
However, first glances can be deceptive, and there is a more important lesson 
to be learned from a closer reading of the cities' lawsuit against the county. 
</P>
<P>
The three cities are next to San Marcos and are concerned about the effect of 
the plant on their communities. But more than that, the cities are challenging 
the way the county has been doing business concerning the largest proposed 
public-works project in San Diego's history. Escondido, Carlsbad and Encinitas 
are alleging that the county has violated public records and competitive 
bidding laws in pursuing secret negotiations with the proponents of the 
trash-to-energy plant. 
</P>
<P>
Christward Ministry, a private entity, also filed a lawsuit challenging the 
county's way of conducting business, though from a different angle. Christward 
Ministry alleged that the county failed to give citizens notice and an 
opportunity to be heard (as required by California's open meeting law) and that 
the Board of Supervisors spent public money for the plant negotiations without 
the necessary number of votes. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the cases have an important lesson for the residents of San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Public agencies in California are subject to some of the most rigorous 
procedural rules imposed on local governments in the nation. There is the Brown 
Act, which requires that meetings be open to the public, that agendas with all 
items for action be posted in advance of meetings and that citizens be given an 
opportunity to comment on proposed actions. 
</P>
<P>
There is the Public Records Act, requiring that public records be made 
available to citizens. There are also laws requiring competitive bidding for 
public projects and other procedural rules, such as that section of the 
government code cited by Christward Ministry requiring four votes before the 
Board of Supervisors can spend certain revenues. 
</P>
<P>
All of these laws have been enacted because citizens require that their 
governing bodies act in an open manner so that they can be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows these laws better than the public agencies that operate under 
them. Most public officials in California can quote the basics of the Brown Act 
from memory. The public-records law is highly familiar to public officials who 
work with it on a daily basis. Competitive bidding is a basic prerequisite to 
most public projects. Public lawyers work with these laws all of the time and 
must be prepared to advise city councils, boards of supervisors and the public 
of what the laws mean and what they require. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, when one public agency says another public agency is not going by 
the rules that govern all of them, it is worth a second look. 
</P>
<P>
We expect citizens to police their governments. The Christward Ministries 
lawsuit is an example of this watchdog activity by a private entity. 
</P>
<P>
We should also expect our public agencies to police each other. That is part of 
the system of checks and balances that has kept this country and its many local 
governments on an even keel for more than two centuries. This was aptly stated 
by the California Supreme Court: "If we say with Mr. Justice Holmes, 'Men must 
turn square corners when they deal with the government', it is hard to see why 
the government should not be held to a like standard of rectangular rectitude 
when dealing with its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, that system is working well. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido, Carlsbad and Encinitas should not be taken lightly when they speak 
out concerning how another local government is conducting its affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how the cities and their constituents feel about a proposed 
trash-to-energy plant, they know the rules because they operate under them 
every day. And the cities should be the first to recognize when those rules are 
being violated. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, if a judge requires absolute adherence to these important 
procedural laws, the cities bringing the lawsuit will be obliged to follow 
those same procedures. The burden may fall on the county as an immediate 
result, but precedent will be established binding the cities as well. This 
provides ample incentive for the cities to have carefully considered the merits 
of their position before commencing the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Even the county should be inclined to admit at least the spirit, if not the 
details, of these lawsuits. If the county really believes that a 
trash-to-energy plant would be in the best interest of its constituents, that 
interest is better served through a process in which everybody knows what is 
going on and has a chance to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Even for opponents of the plant, there must exist at least the satisfaction of 
knowing how the decision was made and knowing that the process was in 
compliance with each and every applicable law. 
</P>
<P>
The public perception issue cannot be ignored either. A recent editorial in 
this paper correctly noted the frustration shared with opponents about the lack 
of public information on the project and encouraged the county to open the 
contract proposal to public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, a first glance may indicate just one more vexatious lawsuit by some 
disgruntled public agencies. But a second, more careful look, will reveal some 
genuine concerns for all residents in this county. These lawsuits say more 
about good government than they do about trash to energy.

'POLICE OFFICER NOT CHARGED IN SHOOTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Newport Beach Police Officer Not Charged in Shooting": 
</P>
<P>
I, too, was saddened over the news of the Sept. 4 shooting of Sundaga Bryant on 
the Balboa Beach by Police Officer Derek Duncan. I remember that hot, 
emotionally charged night and I prayed for Sundaga after that. I am grateful to 
God that his wounds were not greater and that he will recover. 
</P>
<P>
I feel, however, that I must protest his statement, "What gave this man the 
motive to come out there with a shotgun and blow me away," because I know that 
Officer Duncan did not shoot him intentionally. Having met and known Derek 
personally through the Neighborhood Watch Program, I can tell you that he is 
sensitive, shy and very committed to doing his job and helping people. So I 
pray for him also, that he will recover from the mental anguish of an 
accidental shooting. 
</P>
<P>
And, I hope that both these young men will get on with their lives, wiser for 
the sad experience, but better equipped to help others with their growth 
because of it.

ON THE ROAD TO DISCOVERING THE MEANING OF LIFE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, Dianne Klein is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was upstairs, changing. My husband walks in, dispenses with any greeting, and 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know how long it took me just to get from Fairview to Jamboree?" he 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
I knew, of course. I always know. 
</P>
<P>
"Half an hour," I say. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I couldn't believe it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," I say. 
</P>
<P>
This is a conversation that my husband and I have a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Only it's not really a conversation in the sense that questions are asked and 
answers expected. It's more along the lines of a mutual whine. 
</P>
<P>
I've noticed that we are doing more and more of this lately, this whining, as 
are our friends. Sometimes at places like dinner parties and the like my 
husband even repeats verbatim his sure-fire conversation starter of, "Do you 
know how long. . ." 
</P>
<P>
I've noticed that here in Orange County, this line never fails to elicit a 
response or even to ignite passion. Mention the Performing Arts Center and eyes 
turn to marbles. Opine on the plight of some endangered marsh bird and it's 
time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
But traffic? Orange County loves to talk traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Bring it up and pretty soon the guy across the table is weighing in with, "I 
know. I know. . . . And do you know how long. . ." 
</P>
<P>
And then when that gets a little old, the conversation will move on to how 
weird it was the other day when hardly anybody was on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I know," someone will say. "Same thing happened to me. A Friday 
afternoon. Go figure it. We got there early." 
</P>
<P>
All this road talk was rather new to me, seeing as how before Orange County, I 
had spent a lot of time in more compact metropolitan areas where others did the 
driving. It wasn't worth much comment. 
</P>
<P>
So being suddenly immersed in all this threw me at first. For one, I worried 
that it signaled a troubling trend in my marriage. 
</P>
<P>
I used to think that maybe my husband and I were getting obsessed about traffic 
so as to subconsciously avoid discussion about any disturbing undercurrents 
that might be coursing through our relationship. 
</P>
<P>
I noticed, for example, that we were hardly ever talking about money, or sex, 
or the various schools of thought on child rearing. We pretty well summed up 
all those subjects with either a yes or a no. 
</P>
<P>
But then I got to thinking. What else do people in Orange County talk about? 
Let's see, some people talk about sports. I don't, but some people do. 
</P>
<P>
My husband will on occasion engage in such prattle with the guys at the office. 
But no major league teams have the words Orange County on their uniforms. There 
is nothing uniquely Orange County about this prattle. 
</P>
<P>
My husband will brag about the Atlanta Hawks. Another guy will ramble on about 
the Lakers, and then there's another one who, regardless of what sport happens 
to be under discussion, can't shut up about the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Also big on the Orange County conversation circuit, I've found, are astute 
observations about supermarkets, movies, what neighbors paid for their house 
and the quality of pediatric and veterinary care. 
</P>
<P>
But such is not the stuff of what one could call a quintessential Orange County 
story. 
</P>
<P>
You know what I'm talking about. This would be something like a Los Angeles 
story. The other night, for example, my neighbor was almost breathless when she 
told me a tale about her cousin who was dating some actor whose name I had 
never heard and who had a role in some movie whose name escapes me. That is a 
Los Angeles story. 
</P>
<P>
Or a New York story. I personally have plenty of those to tell. Like the guy 
sitting next to me on the subway who disrobed completely while everybody, 
myself included, pretended not to notice. Or the other guy who stood in the 
middle of yet another subway car, on which I happened to be riding, and 
urinated. That, too, was a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
But what does Orange County have? Sure, it has a few other distinguishing 
characteristics such as rabid Republicanism and fundamentalist fervor, but you 
can't talk about those things in polite company. 
</P>
<P>
(Not until you've polled the crowd, that is. Sometimes even weirdos can appear 
normal on the outside.) 
</P>
<P>
So what we're left with is traffic. You can hate it even if you love Jerry 
Falwell or you despise Bob Dornan. Traffic brings a sense of community. Traffic 
is so universally detested that in Orange County, it rivals talk of the weather 
as the great joiner. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, now that I think about it, my husband and I feel closer to each other 
when we talk about traffic. 
</P>
<P>
We understand each other when we talk traffic. Traffic is empathy. Traffic is 
love. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic is Orange County.

PERILS OF CENSORSHIP AND PORNOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the "Stanton Anti-Porn" editorial of Feb. 5: I am in complete disagreement 
with the implication that pornography is more desirable than "misguided efforts 
to restrict it through censorship." And that the "biggest threat to the 
community is the city's attempt at censorship." 
</P>
<P>
A far greater threat to the city of Stanton, and every other city in our 
nation, is the threat of the crime, disease and human degradation that 
pornographic "sex shops" contribute to the community. Even the most casual 
observer in any city that is tolerant of pornography stores can see clearly 
evidence of the drugs, prostitution (both heterosexual and homosexual) and 
blatant crime that occurs in the regions in which the stores are located. 
</P>
<P>
If the city is intolerant to the first business that wishes to profit off this 
perversion of marital sexual intimacy, then there is no encouragement to other 
businesses to follow suit and set up their establishments. It was a travesty of 
justice that took away the right of the city of Stanton to preserve itself as a 
city of decency. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the material a store sells is pornographic is the question and 
the danger. To demonstrate the truth of this, simply tour any city's "combat 
zone," the porn retailers. Ask the city's police department if it feels there 
is no danger.

Corona del Mar senior Doug Shulein's petition to overturn Supt. John Nicoll's 
prohibition of homosexual speakers in a supervised high school classroom 
psychology class comes as a breath of fresh air to a stagnant atmosphere that 
has developed over the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Shulein (and other responsible, well-informed students and parents alike) have 
learned more about the workings of a free democratic society than some of our 
less-enlightened colleagues. This latter well-intentioned group would continue 
to protect us all from social and political evils -- the 
"we-know-what's-best-for-you" approach that is all too common amongst fearful 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, I agree with Doug Shulein. The best method of dealing with a complex 
issue -- be it homosexuality, drugs, firearms or other social dilemmas that 
permeate our society -- is through trying to understand all component parts. 
Our generation has not done well. Our children should be allowed the 
opportunity to do better.

DANNEMEYER'S STANCE ON GAYS AND LESBIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Feb. 5 letters page is dominated by a discussion of various issues 
affecting gay men and lesbians in Orange County. This is a response to Rep. 
Dannemeyer's letter and the letter from Mr. and Mrs. Wipperman. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer contends that homosexuality is a matter of personal choice and 
therefore those who are gay or lesbian do not deserve the protection of the law 
with reference to discrimination in housing or employment. 
</P>
<P>
I leave to Dannemeyer the task of presenting scientific evidence supporting his 
notion that sexual orientation is a "choice" (by definition, a conscious act). 
My comments are directed instead at two other points. 
</P>
<P>
First, I doubt that many Americans agree with Dannemeyer that ostensible 
"matters of choice" are beyond the protective power of the law. The Irvine 
ordinance in question also prohibits discrimination on the basis of "religion" 
and "marital status." I have not heard him dispute the appropriateness of their 
provisions. Does he contend that religion is not a matter of personal choice? 
Or that some people are born married? 
</P>
<P>
Second, Dannemeyer is blasting an ordinance that he seems not to have read. The 
text does not sanction any particular behavior, "abhorrent" or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
As to the Wippermans: The notion that any subject that arouses controversy 
among the taxpayers should be banished from discussion in a high school 
classroom is a plausible policy option, though one which I regard as 
destructive and impractical. But what, then, would actually be discussed in a 
psychology class? Or a political science class? Even the study of literature 
has the power to arouse. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any consensus on the question of the origin of sexual orientation, 
the majority sentiment at present is opposed to the position taken by the 
Wippermans. If something must be done, wouldn't it make more sense to allow 
parents with strong objections to withdraw their children from class on that 
particular day, rather than promulgating a watered-down, craven curriculum that 
offends no one and cheats the student out of a first-class education?

In response to Dannemeyer's comments, I think the congressman has done the 
world a favor by removing all doubt about his identity as a hateful bigot. If 
Californians are as "discriminating" as he suggests, then why have they 
repeatedly rejected the congressman's radical proposals on AIDS and other 
sensitive topics? If American citizens are such "discriminating people," then 
why do they elect a vast majority to the House of Representatives and Senate 
who repudiate Congressman Dannemeyer's simplistic and insensitive approach to 
addressing the nation's health problems. 
</P>
<P>
I can only hope that equally as discriminating voters in the 39th Congressional 
District will one day wake up and realize who we have sent to Congress, and 
give Dannemeyer the retirement he so justly deserves.

I stand in awe of Dannemeyer's ability to express in writing the kind of drivel 
that is usually spoken hurriedly at political functions. His cockeyed logic and 
garbled "facts" are a tribute to classic demagogism. 
</P>
<P>
Demagogue he is. Demagogues simply cannot function without an "enemy of the 
people." Where would Hitler have been without the Jews, or McCarthy without a 
Commie under every bed? How could they have functioned without fear, blind 
prejudice and followers willing to swallow all their twisted logic and blatant 
lies? 
</P>
<P>
I won't bother to list or repudiate all of the stupidities apparent in the 
Letter to the Editor of Feb. 5. It is all crystal clear to every intelligent, 
right-thinking person who read the hateful thing and none of it will ever be 
questioned by sick, fearful people who see danger to themselves everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
It is so sadly true that those who will not learn from history are doomed to 
repeat it.

<P>
I was sickened by Dannemeyer's letter. His representation of our county in 
Congress as well as that of his ideological twin, Rep. Robert K. Dornan, is an 
embarrassment to all reasonable-minded citizens. 
</P>
<P>
As a mental health professional for the last 24 years I take exception to 
Dannemeyer's view that homosexuality is a personal choice. All homosexuals I 
have had contact with have expressed feelings of being "different" as soon as 
early latency period and, at the latest, early adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
To think that an individual would willingly choose to be treated as a leper and 
be subjected to discrimination and prejudice is foolish. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Laguna Beach, I find our homosexual neighbors concerned about 
the identical issues as other homeowners. I know of no homosexuals who are 
remotely interested in "hopping from small city to small city to promote 
ordinances" as the representative's paranoia would suggest. I, for one, have 
had enough of his sick rantings.

ST. MARY'S 95-81 WIN OVER LOYOLA LEAVES GAELS IN GOOD SHAPE IN WCAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

MORAGA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Mary's took charge of the West Coast Athletic Conference race Saturday 
night with a convincing 95-81 victory over Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
Before a boisterous standing-room crowd of 3,550, the Gaels took control with a 
14-0 run in the second half to put them in good position in the WCAC race, 
though there are still four games left. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave St. Mary's (20-3) its first 20-win season since 1941-42, and 
left the Gaels tied with Pepperdine for first place in the WCAC at 8-2. Loyola 
is 14-9 and 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
If St. Mary's and Pepperdine win their remaining four games, St. Mary's would 
be seeded No. 1 in the WCAC postseason tournament by virtue of its sweep of 
Loyola. St. Mary's also would be seeded over Loyola if they tie. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd may have been premature in chanting "N-C-A-A" at the end of the game 
-- the WCAC's automatic bid goes to the postseason tournament winner -- but 
everyone here, from the fans to Coach Lynn Nance, clearly believed that the 
Gaels had beaten their top competition. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Nance and his players returned to the court, high-fived the 
students and led cheers. The celebration culminated in Nance being carried off 
on the shoulders of players and fans. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola appeared to be in good shape at halftime, taking control after six early 
ties. With Hank Gathers getting 20 points and eight rebounds in the half, the 
Lions pulled away from a 19-19 tie to a lead that reached 42-33, and they led 
at the half, 50-45. 
</P>
<P>
The game continued to seesaw into the second half, with the teams battling to a 
62-62 tie with 11 minutes left. But Loyola went cold for more than 4 minutes, 
and the Gaels ran off their decisive 14-0 streak. Loyola never got closer than 
89-80, despite Gathers' 37 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which shot 51% in the first half, shot only 32% after halftime. Its 31 
second-half points were its fewest of the season for a half. St. Mary's, which 
made 20 of 27 second-half shots, mostly in the paint, shot 67% for the game. 
Only two other Loyola players, Enoch Simmons (12) and Bo Kimble (10), joined 
Gathers in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Erick Newman, Robert Haugen and Al Lewis led St. Mary with 21 points each. Dan 
Curry added 16. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace was good, we missed some shots, they scored and a two-point game 
became a 12-point game," Lion Coach Paul Westhead said. "We just didn't have 
enough left to dig out. Then they went to their inside game and hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
With Curry, a 6-foot-9 center, having trouble containing the 6-7 Gathers, Nance 
shifted Newman, a 6-4 forward, to guard him after halftime. "In the first half 
I questioned our emotion," Nance said. "Loyola was really ready to play. We 
were really quiet. Gathers was just killing us. He was beating us by himself. . 
. . He's such a tough matchup for centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We put Newman on him -- that was really a gamble. Erick did an excellent job. 
I think that was the difference, that and we got much more aggressive in the 
second half." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, however, said he believed he could have gotten the ball and posted up 
Newman, but his guards didn't feed him. 
</P>
<P>
"St. Mary's did an excellent job of blocking us out," Gathers said. "Then we 
really hurt ourselves in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Gathers said St. Mary's "can beat anybody on a given night." 
</P>
<P>
But he issued a challenge: "In the tournament, (St. Mary's) has gotta prove 
themselves again, just like we did last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think we're the best team in the league. We're just not playing like 
it. I still think we're gonna win the tournament. Our guys have just got to 
realize how serious this is."

ELLISON WON'T LET CRITICISM BOTHER HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the University of Louisville basketball team celebrated its National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship three years ago, former Louisville 
center Charles Jones made his way from freshman to freshman in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Three more, man," Jones called out excitedly. "You'll almost have enough rings 
for one hand." 
</P>
<P>
And who could blame Jones for his optimism? 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the group was (Never Nervous) Pervis Ellison, an unaffected, 
smooth-as-silk 6-foot-9 center from Savannah, Ga., who had dominated the 
championship game as no 18-year-old had before him. 
</P>
<P>
After a 25-point, 11-rebound performance against Duke in a 72-69 Louisville 
victory, Ellison had been named as the Final Four's outstanding player, the 
first freshman so honored in 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
Why couldn't Louisville win three more titles? 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't, of course, and Ellison, who will lead the Cardinals (17-4) against 
UCLA (15-5) in a nationally televised game today at Pauley Pavilion, has been 
viewed in some circles as less than successful because of it. 
</P>
<P>
Is the criticism valid? 
</P>
<P>
Not most of it. 
</P>
<P>
Is Ellison bothered by it? 
</P>
<P>
Not at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've gotten better each year, and that's my major concern," he said 
last week. "It's good to think that the public appreciates what you're trying 
to do on the court, but I'll be satisfied if my teammates are confident in me. 
</P>
<P>
"Who cares what anybody else thinks?" 
</P>
<P>
Ellison hasn't exactly disappeared since that April night in Dallas three years 
ago, although it might seem that way. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, he posted bigger numbers as a sophomore than he had as a 
freshman and bigger numbers as a junior than he had as a sophomore, averaging 
17.6 points, 8.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists last season and making 60.1% of his 
shots in leading Louisville to the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ellison was the country's only player to total more than 100 
points, rebounds, assists and blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he leads the Cardinals with averages of 17.3 points and 7.9 
rebounds and a .634 shooting percentage. He has 62 blocked shots, 20 more than 
all of Louisville's opponents combined. 
</P>
<P>
And he also leads the fourth-ranked Cardinals in steals and is third in 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana Coach Bob Knight called Ellison the best all-around player in the 
country two months ago after Ellison led Louisville's 101-79 dismantling of the 
Hoosiers. If he were starting a team, Knight said, Ellison would be the player 
around whom he would build. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas had similar sentiments last month 
after Ellison led a 92-74 rout of the Rebels, making 10 of 11 shots and 
equaling a career high with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Scouts fawn over the versatile Ellison, who plays with an effortlessness that 
belies his determination. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be a very easy game for him to play," said Jerry West, Laker 
general manager. "At that size, that's very appealing because there are people 
that size who labor to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got real good hands for a big guy and he seems to have a real good grasp 
of what's going on out there -- he passes the ball, he's alert. He doesn't make 
a lot of mistakes. He's a very attractive player." 
</P>
<P>
Marty Blake, director of scouting for the National Basketball Assn., said that 
Ellison may be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Ellison is not an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that Ellison should be more assertive and that a player 
of his skills should be more of a scorer. 
</P>
<P>
But, in Coach Denny Crum's 18 seasons at Louisville, only two players, Jim 
Price in 1971-72 and Darrell Griffith in 1979-80, have averaged 20 points or 
more in a season, and Ellison averages only about 11 shots a game. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Ellison's reputation was sullied not more than two months after his 
moment of glory at Dallas, when he was sent home early from tryouts for the 
U.S. team that competed in the 1986 world championships at Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said he missed practice because he was sick. 
</P>
<P>
But Jerry Pimm of UC Santa Barbara, who assisted Arizona's Lute Olson in 
coaching the U.S. team that competed in Spain, said Ellison was disinterested. 
</P>
<P>
"He acted like it was a real big chore for him to be there," Pimm said. "In my 
opinion, he did not want to be there. I observed him in the dining hall, and if 
he was sick, he sure was not eating like he was sick. He was eating two big 
plates of food every meal he took. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a mental tiredness and just immaturity on his part." 
</P>
<P>
The perception that Ellison was aloof was enhanced the next season when he 
didn't speak with reporters, or virtually anyone else, and Louisville lost 14 
of 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
In a 75-52 loss to Memphis State in the final Metro Conference tournament game, 
with an NCAA tournament berth on the line, Ellison scored only three points and 
took no shots in the second half. For the first time since 1965, the defending 
national champion did not play in a postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Was Ellison to blame? 
</P>
<P>
Crum thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most people expected so much that when our team wasn't very good, it 
reflected on him," Crum said. "But, under the circumstances, he had a great 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA adopted a three-point shot that season, but Louisville, slow to react 
to the new rule, had no outside threats, Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody zoned us and they double- and triple-teamed Pervis all year long," 
Crum said. "Despite that, he was better, statistically, in every single 
category. 
</P>
<P>
"To improve in every category when you don't have a supporting cast and you're 
being double- and triple-teamed, that's pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
As well as he might have played as a sophomore, Ellison was even better last 
season, when he competed through the pain of tendinitis in his left knee, 
sharing conference player of the year honors with Bimbo Coles of Virginia Tech 
and leading Louisville to a 24-11 season. 
</P>
<P>
He did not try out for the U.S. Olympic team last summer, he said, because of 
the pain in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
It was not an easy decision. 
</P>
<P>
"All athletes thrive on competition and everybody wants to play against the 
Russians," said Ellison, who was the No. 2 rebounder on the U.S. team that was 
upset by Brazil in the Pan-American Games final in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison, though, believed it would be better to rest his knee last summer, and 
he started the season stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
All had gone well, too, until Ellison injured his left knee two weeks ago in a 
game against Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which opened the season with two upset losses, had won 14 
consecutive games and, if it beat Ohio State, figured to move to the top of the 
polls after No. 1 Illinois and No. 2 Georgetown had both been defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison was enjoying a "fantastic" season, Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
And UCLA Coach Jim Harrick, looking ahead with trepidation to today's game, 
called Ellison a unique talent. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any player, David Robinson included, that has been above the 
rim more consistently than Pervis Ellison," Harrick said. "Most rebounds, pro 
and college, are taken below the rim at about the nine-foot level. Pervis 
Ellison is the only guy I've ever been around that consistently gets his 
rebounds well above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
But, on the afternoon of Jan. 29, only 44 seconds before halftime, Ellison lay 
silent on the floor at Louisville's Freedom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Having chased down a loose ball, Ellison had planted his right foot, only to 
have it slip out from under him, causing him to do the splits. 
</P>
<P>
Crum described the scene as frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"It happened right in front of our bench and it really was a depressing 
moment," Crum said. "There were more than 19,600 people in Freedom Hall and you 
could've heard a pin drop. Everyone was just dumbfounded." 
</P>
<P>
Ellison, who was dumbstruck himself, later told reporters: "I could just see 
dollar bills flying away. I guess that's why I couldn't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State went on to an 85-79 victory, overcoming a 10-point second-half 
deficit in Ellison's absence, and 24 anxious hours followed for Louisville and 
its fans before it was determined that Ellison's injury was not as serious as 
was first feared. 
</P>
<P>
His left knee was bruised, but internal damage was minimal -- a sprained 
ligament. 
</P>
<P>
Ellison missed two games, but in two games since his return last Monday, he has 
36 points, 13 rebounds, six blocked shots and five steals. 
</P>
<P>
And he is talking again about going out the way he came in. 
</P>
<P>
On top. 
</P>
<P>
The national championship game, April 3 in the Kingdome at Seattle, will be 
played on Ellison's 22nd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a shot," Ellison said. "We just have to play sound basketball and 
smart basketball. All the tools are there. We've got good rebounders, good 
shooters. We've got good defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got talent, but it takes more than talent to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows that, it seems, as well as Pervis Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Today's game will be televised nationally by ABC at 11:30 a.m. . . . UCLA leads 
the series against Louisville, 7-4, and is 3-0 against the Cardinals at Pauley 
Pavilion. . . . Said Marty Blake, director of scouting for the National 
Basketball Assn.: "Louisville has as much talent as anybody in the country. 
When they play (7-foot junior) Felton Spencer at center and Pervis Ellison at 
forward, they're awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville Coach Denny Crum is in the sixth season of a 10-year agreement 
calling for a $1 million bonus if he completes the contract unencumbered by 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. probation. . . . Larry Williams, whose 
career at Louisville ended in 1979, is the only four-year Cardinal during 
Crum's tenure that has not played in at least one Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
In UCLA's last four games, Pooh Richardson averaged 18.5 points and 7.5 
assists, shot .614 from the floor and had 10 steals and only nine turnovers. He 
had only one turnover in UCLA's last two games. . . . In two games against USC, 
Don MacLean averaged only 10.5 points and 3.5 rebounds and shot .318. Overall, 
the freshman forward is averaging 19.3 points and 7.6 rebounds and shooting 
.554. 
</P>
<P>
USC's .372 shooting percentage last Wednesday night was the worst by a UCLA 
opponent this season. . . . UCLA is 9-1 in Pauley Pavilion.

AZTECS SUSPEND BRYAN WILLIAMS, LOSE TO UTAH

<P>
The loss of playmaker Bryan Williams was at least three points too much for San 
Diego State's basketball team to overcome Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the game against Utah at the San Diego Sports Arena, Coach Jim 
Brandenburg announced that Williams had been suspended for the remainder of the 
season after being arrested Tuesday for petty theft. Without the man who makes 
their offense go, the Aztecs lost a hard-fought, 80-77 decision in front of 
4,077 and a regional television audience. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 23, a senior from St. Bernard High School in Playa del Rey, was 
apprehended at the SDSU bookstore and booked for an appearance in San Diego 
Municipal Court March 20. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Ed Gilbert of the campus police said Williams "stole some textbooks" from 
the bookstore. Gilbert said he didn't know many books were involved. He said 
Williams was caught by a plainclothes security guard hired by Aztec Shops, 
which runs the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said he wasn't told of Williams' arrest until just before Friday's 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
"He practiced with us, because I didn't have all the details," Brandenburg 
said, "Once I checked it out, I took the appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
Williams could not be reached for comment, but Brandenburg said, "He took it 
very hard. He was very, very remorseful. Basically, he's a good person, and 
it's just a shame this happened." 
</P>
<P>
This was Williams' second suspension in a little more than a week. He sat out 
the Air Force game in Colorado Springs Feb. 4 because of a curfew violation. 
But he was restored to good standing for the Brigham Young game here Thursday 
night and was instrumental in the Aztecs' 89-74 victory. He played one of his 
best games of the season, setting up countless fast breaks and contributing 13 
points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
A transfer from Cerritos College, Williams had started 46 of SDSU's 50 games in 
the past two seasons. He averaged 9.7 points and 5.3 assists last season and 
8.7 points and 4.8 assists this season. 
</P>
<P>
With Williams' college career over, Brandenburg moved Michael Best from 
shooting guard to point guard and inserted Tony Ross in Best's place. Rodney 
Jones and Kevin Honaker also filled in at the point, Jones for 14 minutes and 
Honaker for 2, and both were involved in key plays that went against the Aztecs 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:44 to play and Utah holding a 71-68 lead, Jones was called for a 
5-second violation after failing to advance the ball while being closely 
guarded outside the small line near the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"I was about to go to Tony (Ross) for a three-pointer when I heard the 
whistle," Jones said. "I really don't think I had the ball for 5 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Ross already had made two three-point shots and was to add a third later. 
Another at that point would have tied the score. Instead, the Aztecs had to 
foul in desperation, and two free throws each by Josh Grant and Jimmy Madison 
ran Utah's margin to 75-68 with 1:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
Ross rallied the Aztecs with a rare four-point play (he was fouled by Jon 
Hansen while connecting from three-point range), and the Utes helped further by 
missing five of their last six free throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Given this run of breaks, topped by Boo Singletary's two missed free throws 
with 7 seconds remaining, the Aztecs trailed by only three points and had one 
last chance to send the game into overtime. When they called a timeout 2 
seconds later, Brandenburg set up a play for Honaker. 
</P>
<P>
Honaker doesn't play much, but he had made four of seven three-point tries this 
season, so Brandenburg considered him the best bet, with Ross the alternate. 
</P>
<P>
The Utes, figuring that the ball would go to Ross, left Honaker wide open. It 
looked good as it arched toward the basket, but the ball caromed off the rim as 
the final buzzer sounded. When Honaker saw it bounce away, he fell to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so close," Brandenburg said. "I really believe that if Kevin had made 
that shot, we would have won the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, SDSU fell to 10-12, 4-8 in the Western Athletic Conference. Utah 
improved to 14-11 and 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
Utah Coach Lynn Archibald didn't hesitate to say that his team had benefited 
from Williams' absence. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you lose your floor leader, it's bound to hurt you," Archibald said. 
"He handles the ball and penetrates exceptionally well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a shame that a thing like that happened." 
</P>
<P>
Grant, Utah's 6-9 freshman, came into the game with only an 8.8-point average, 
but sank eight of 11 shots, including four of six three-pointers, to tie his 
career high of 24 points. He also topped both teams in rebounds with 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Their zone defense gave me a lot of good shots," Grant said. "Apparently the 
word is out that the Utes can't play against a zone. Today we did a little 
better than in the past." 
</P>
<P>
For SDSU, Mitch McMullen had his second 18-point game in a row after being 
hampered for almost a month with an Achilles' tendon injury. He also grabbed 10 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs' four other starters also scored in double figures, but their 
marksmanship left much to be desired. They shot only 40.4% from the floor 
compared to the Utes' 55.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg summed up this deficiency by saying, "You're not going to win many 
games when you've got guys shooting four for 12 (Shawn Bell), four for 11 
(Best) and five for 12 (McMullen)." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Aztecs played with far less emotion than they had against BYU, and to 
top things off, they couldn't cope with Grant either inside or outside.

MR. FIX-IT?;

AS A YOUNGSTER, HE WAS HANDY AROUND THE HOUSE; DAN HENNING'S NEXT ODD JOB WILL 
BE THE CHARGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
When Walter F. Henning moved his family from the Bronx to Queens nearly half a 
century ago, his wife, the former Mary Riley, was pregnant with her fourth son, 
Daniel, who would be born on the first day of the summer of '42. 
</P>
<P>
Queens was positively pastoral then. There were two parks within walking 
distance of the new Henning home. There were woods. And there were no next-door 
neighbors. Urban sprawl would be the next generation's future shock. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Henning worked as a detective in the Manhattan theater district. He 
spent most of his adult life bearding murderers, tracking rapists and boxing 
the ears of the occasional gate crasher. When duty kept Walter from returning 
to Queens at the appointed dinner hour, Mary would set the table, call her 
sons, say grace and then explain matter-of-factly, "We're going to eat early 
tonight. Your father has a homicide." 
</P>
<P>
The Rileys had arrived in the Bronx from Ireland in 1840. The Hennings had 
emigrated from Germany. Dan Henning was the fourth of six boys. Much later, his 
father would single him out along with his oldest brother, John. He would 
upbraid them for their choice of professions. 
</P>
<P>
"You two are doing all right," the New York detective would say. "But when are 
you going to find a more stable line of work?" 
</P>
<P>
John Henning is an anchorman and political reporter for WBZ-TV in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning is the new head football coach of the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"Boys Town," is John Henning's two-word description of growing up a Henning in 
Queens, New York, in the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
From his family's two-story home, Dan Henning had to take a bus, a subway and 
an elevated train to get to school every day. Nevertheless, he was an all-city 
quarterback at Brooklyn's St. Francis Prep. He also starred in basketball and 
baseball, the two sports pursued more regularly by his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan was always playing over his head because he was always playing with the 
older guys," says John Henning. "But he was always a leader, and he always 
played quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the boys grew up. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 son, Jim Henning, was the free spirit. He never married. He drove a cab 
for a while. He worked for a security firm. He lives in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 son, Michael Henning, runs the New York office of the accounting firm of 
Ernst &amp; Whinney. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 son, Paul Henning, works in public relations for Wang Computers in 
Lowell, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 son, Peter Henning (17 years younger than John), manages McGovern's, a 
restaurant and bar in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all different," says Mary Henning, who still lives in the same 
house. "They all had their good qualities. Dan was always very helpful at home. 
He would fix things. I depended on him a lot. I just wish he would stop 
smoking. Neither of his parents ever smoked." 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Falcons were depending on Henning to fix the mess they had created 
for themselves before they hired him as their coach in 1983. Henning was the 
trusted lieutenant who had helped Coach Joe Gibbs lead the Washington Redskins 
to a Super Bowl victory following the strike-torn 1982 season. 
</P>
<P>
But the Falcons were a franchise in disrepair. The Rankin Smith family lacked 
direction. Members of the media compared the Smiths to the buffoonish 
Clampetts, the fictional TV hillbillies who jalopied their way to Beverly Hills 
in the early '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Henning wanted to mend the Falcons' ways in the worst way. But the defense he 
inherited was mostly a collection of slow overachievers. His quarterback, Steve 
Bartkowski, never terribly mobile, was nearing the end of an injury-plagued 
career. William Andrews, his best back, would soon suffer a devastating knee 
injury from which he would never fully recover. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Henning's Falcons beat the Bears at Chicago in his first game as coach. 
They did well to finish 7-9. But two miserable 4-12 seasons followed. And the 
Smiths wanted to fire this wise-cracking northerner who certain Atlantans were 
beginning to perceive as an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people thought he was a smart-(aleck) New Yorker," says 
sportswriter Glenn Sheeley, who covered Henning's Falcons for the Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. "He had trouble talking to the average southerner." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody shared that opinion. After St. Francis Prep, Henning had received 
a football scholarship to attend William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Va. At 
subsequent family reunions, his brothers would chide him about his accent, 
which had gradually become more "y'all" than "youse guys". 
</P>
<P>
By the time he got to Atlanta, Henning had coached in Tallahassee, Fla., 
Blacksburg, Va., Houston and Miami. "Dan's a southern boy now," John Henning 
says. "He's much more of a southern charmer than he is a Hell's Kitchen kid." 
</P>
<P>
After the disastrous 1986 season, Henning charmed the Smiths into another year 
as head coach. They had wanted to hire former Eagles' Coach Dick Vermeil or 
UCLA's Terry Donahue. Vermeil and Donahue balked at the Smiths' reputation. 
Meanwhile, Henning moved quickly to hire Marion Campbell, the former Falcon 
head coach, as his defensive coordinator when the Eagles dumped Campbell for 
Buddy Ryan. It bought Henning one more year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Henning had always focused on the offensive side of the football. But the 1986 
Falcons had allowed more points than any team in the NFL. Henning wasn't blind 
to the needs of the defense, but the beginning of the end for him in Atlanta 
was the 1986 draft, during which he allowed Campbell to stock his 3-4 defense 
with the Falcons' first two selections (second and 17th overall). 
</P>
<P>
The picks turned out to be Oklahoma nose tackle Tony Casillas and Syracuse 
linebacker Tim Green. Campbell's 1986 defense improved from 25th in yards 
allowed the previous year to seventh. And the Falcons got off to a surprising 
5-1-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
But Casillas and Green weren't the players Atlanta hoped they would be. Still 
aren't. Instead of Casillas, Atlanta should have gone for Purdue quarterback 
Jim Everett. Houston gladly snatched Everett with the next pick after Casillas 
before trading him to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The Henning drafts came under increasingly close scrutiny. Why, people wanted 
to know, had the Falcons selected defensive players with their first two picks 
in 1984 when Maryland quarterback Boomer Esiason was still available? 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, Cincinnati selected three players in the 1984 draft before 
choosing Esiason. And the fact is, Falcon personnel boss Tom Braatz, now with 
Green Bay, was more responsible than Henning for the failure to land Esiason. 
But in the four Atlanta drafts in which he participated actively, the Falcons 
chose only one offensive player, Pittsburgh guard Bill Fralic, with one of 
their first two selections. 
</P>
<P>
When the Falcons lost five in a row after their fast 1986 start, Henning 
withdrew publicly. His cigarette consumption increased. "Even at Washington, 
Dan would always look like hell by about Thursday of every week," says Joe 
Theismann, the Redskins' quarterback during Henning's first stint there. 
</P>
<P>
The low point came in Week 14, when winless Indianapolis showed up at 
half-empty Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium and beat the Falcons, 28-23. It was 
Ron Meyer's first game as coach of the hapless Colts, who scored late on a 
blocked punt after a penalty had nullified a Falcon punt that would have pinned 
the Colts deep in their own territory. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the Falcons marched 70 yards in 35 seconds. But when tight end 
Arthur Cox, now a Charger, dropped a pass at the goal line, the game was over. 
"It was maybe the most embarrassing moment in the history of the franchise," 
Sheeley says. 
</P>
<P>
And in the week that followed, Henning clammed up even more. He instructed his 
players to do the same. "We'll make our statement on the field," Henning said. 
Their statement turned out to be a 14-9 loss at home to the then-lowly Saints. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Falcons finished 7-8-1. The Smiths replaced Henning with Campbell. So 
Gibbs hired Henning back as a Redskin assistant. He had to outbid Giant Coach 
Bill Parcells. Neither was deterred by the Henning's 22-41-1 record in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, Parcells and Henning had all worked together on Bill Peterson's staff at 
Florida State in the late '60s. Florida State was Henning's first job after a 
spotty professional career as a strong-armed, slew-footed quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Henning's playing career included stints with the semi-pro Springfield (Mass.) 
Acorns and the Norfolk (Va.) Neptunes of the Continental League. After leaving 
William &amp; Mary in 1963, he also spent four seasons, off and on, with the 
Chargers, where he studied at the foot of Coach Sid Gillman, the Socrates of 
offensive football. Henning and Gillman loved each other. 
</P>
<P>
"I called him my 'blackboard quarterback,' " Gillman says. "Because he was so 
bright. He understood the entire concept. He had the total picture." 
</P>
<P>
The picture had come into focus at William &amp; Mary where, in the 
pre-multiple substitution era, Henning called his own plays. "He couldn't run 
worth a damn, but he could throw beautifully," says Milt Drewer. 
</P>
<P>
Drewer was William &amp; Mary's coach at the time. And the skinny backfield 
coach he had hired away from Jerry Burns at Iowa to help tutor Henning was a 
fellow named Lou Holtz. "Lou Holtz hasn't changed," Henning says of the man who 
coached Notre Dame to the national championship of college football last year. 
"He was very demanding." 
</P>
<P>
After Florida State, Henning moved to Virginia Tech, where he was the offensive 
coordinator and the coach responsible for developing Don Strock. He later 
worked for Holtz as an assistant on the Jets, for whom the quarterback was Joe 
Namath. And then he coached the quarterbacks for Don Shula's Dolphins, where he 
was reunited with Strock, by then a dependable backup to Bob Griese. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, he's the guy who made me a quarterback," Strock says. "He is very 
meticulous. And he has no aversion to learning." 
</P>
<P>
When Steve Ortmayer, the Charger director of football operations, introduced 
Henning to the San Diego media Thursday, he described Henning as a "people 
person." 
</P>
<P>
But, says Strock, "He can be serious, tough and aloof. He can be a lot of 
things." 
</P>
<P>
During Henning's two-year hitch with the Jets (he worked with the quarterbacks 
and receivers), they trained at Hofstra College in Hempstead, N.Y. Mary and 
Walter Henning would ride out from Queens, set up beach chairs on the practice 
field and watch their son advise the great Namath. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz had rescued Henning from a position with a security guard firm at the 
World Trade Center, where Henning worked in 1975, his first year out of 
football since infancy. From the Jets, he went to the Dolphins and then to the 
Redskins. Two years after Henning rejoined Gibbs, Washington won the Super 
Bowl. Henning got much of the credit for fine tuning the Redskins' one-back 
offense, which featured a diesel named John Riggins pounding relentlessly off 
tackle and the sprint-dash rollouts of the garrulous Theismann. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a coincidence that the Redskins won the Super Bowl again after Dan 
rejoined them in 1987," Theismann says. "He was a stabilizing influence. I 
still do not agree with his firing in Atlanta. He just hit a ton of lousy 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis, himself a product of New York City's mean streets, apparently agreed 
with Theismann. He tried to hire Henning last year before finally settling on 
Denver's Mike Shanahan as a replacement for Tom Flores. 
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Davis and Henning couldn't agree on terminology and who 
would have final say on roster cuts. Henning says the part about roster cuts 
was never an issue between the two. He also says Davis never offered him the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"We had enough differences of opinion as to the way that thing should be put 
together that I thought it would have been unusual if he had offered me the 
job," Henning says. 
</P>
<P>
They disagreed on too many things. Perhaps because they were too much alike. 
"That might have caused some sparks," says John Henning. "They are the same 
way. Somebody's got to be the boss." 
</P>
<P>
But the qualities that made Henning attractive to Davis in the first place also 
made him attractive to Ortmayer. Ortmayer spent nine years in Davis' 
organization before Charger owner Alex Spanos hired him away two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Henning is Ortmayer's first head coaching hire. If Henning is not successful, 
Ortmayer and Henning will probably be shown the door at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Their immediate and top priority is the quarterback position. Incumbent Mark 
Malone had the lowest listed quarterback rating in the AFC each of the past two 
years. If the 1989 season started tomorrow, he would be the Chargers' best 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In a 13-3 loss to the Raiders on national television in Week 10, Theismann was 
appalled at Malone's performance. "He made at least two decisions and threw one 
flutterball that should have cost him his job right on the spot," Theismann 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning is aware of the problem. One possibility is the April draft, in which 
the Chargers currently hold the No. 8 selection. UCLA's Troy Aikman will be 
long gone by then. And talent appraisers are split on whether USC's Rodney 
Peete has enough promise to merit being chosen that high. Another possibility 
is Miami quarterback Steve Walsh, who hasn't publicly decided whether he will 
make himself available for the 1989 draft. A more remote possibility is the 
acquisition of a conditional free agent -- such as New England's Tony Eason. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm a good football coach," Dan Henning says. "I think I know how to 
organize. I think I know how to coach. I think I have to manipulate the system 
here and massage the computer. What you get out of it, you get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Henning and his wife, Sandy, have five children, including a son, Danny, who 
played quarterback at Maryland and tried out (unsuccessfully) with the Patriots 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
He is the Chargers' eighth head coach in 29 years and still holds the record 
for the longest completion in William &amp; Mary history, an 87-yarder in the 
dying moments of a 44-6 loss to Navy in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
One New York paper ran a picture the next day in its rotogravure section of a 
harried Henning being swallowed by a wave of Navy tacklers. Mary Henning hated 
the picture with a passion. Still does. But she likes San Diego. And, she says, 
"I'm sure he will make a great coach in there." 
</P>
<P>
He is, after all, the son who fixes things.

TODAY'S ALL-STAR GAME MAY LACK THE USUAL MAGIC; 
</P>
<P>
WITHOUT JOHNSON AND BIRD, NBA SHOWCASE JUST WON'T BE THE SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Even without Larry Bird and Magic Johnson among the participants, the National 
Basketball Assn. still is calling this its All-Star game. However, a more apt 
title might be the Not-Quite-All-The-Stars game. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 1980s, when the NBA's rejuvenation coincided with 
their arrival, Bird and Johnson both will not be taking part in the league's 
midseason celebration today at the Houston Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
Bird has been grounded most of the season after surgery to remove bone spurs 
from both feet. Johnson was a late scratch, partially tearing his left 
hamstring on Wednesday night. Add the fact that Michael Jordan pulled out of 
Saturday's slam-dunk competition, and the usually festive weekend does not seem 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
Other well-known names will adorn the marquee, but . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely feels like something's missing without Bird and Magic," Detroit 
Pistons guard Isiah Thomas said. "They are maybe the two greatest players ever. 
For the East, Bird always did the dirty work, getting the rebounds, setting up 
the other guys. And Magic used to set the pace of the game, pushing it to a new 
level. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought that I've got to do something early to make (the game) 
entertaining. That used to be Magic's job. I think there are plenty of great 
players. It may not be as good a game, but we can make it as entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
There still are reasons to believe that today's All-Star game (noon, PST) will 
be as memorable as past games, if not more. 
</P>
<P>
An obvious one: It will be Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 18th and final All-Star 
appearance in his 20th professional season. He was added after Johnson's injury 
opened a roster spot, and his inclusion was applauded by many of the other 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
The exception was outspoken Philadelphia 76ers forward Charles Barkley, who 
danced around the issue for a spell before saying that Commissioner David Stern 
should have replaced Johnson with another guard and not Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
"They should have taken a point guard when Magic got hurt," Barkley said. "But 
they wanted to honor Kareem, and I can understand that. I think it's great that 
they are going to honor him, since it's his last year and all. But . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Barkley paused, then smiled and added: "You know, I'm supposed to be the new 
and improved, more mature Charles Barkley. I shouldn't say anything more about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Other players came to Abdul-Jabbar's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Said Thomas: "Kareem deserves to be here more than any other player. When you 
think about all Kareem has done for basketball, none of us might have been here 
today if it wasn't for Kareem." 
</P>
<P>
Said Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone: "It's just my opinion, and it doesn't mean 
anything. But I think he deserves it. Athletes such as (Abdul-Jabbar) shouldn't 
just be pushed aside and forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Said Laker forward James Worthy: "I thought he should have been voted on (by 
Western Conference coaches) from the beginning. In the last few weeks, the way 
he's played shows that he belongs. No question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Jabbar, the guest of honor at a banquet Saturday night, will be making 
his first appearance at the Astrodome since 1968, when he was called Lew 
Alcindor and UCLA's 47-game winning streak was stopped by Houston, led by Elvin 
Hayes. Playing with a scratched eye that night, Alcindor made just four of 18 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Abdul-Jabbar is hoping for a better performance today. But he figures 
to play merely a cameo role, considering that he is the fourth center on the 
Western Conference team. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the focus figures to be on Houston Rockets center Akeem Olajuwon. The 
trend in recent All-Star games is that a player in the host city is the leading 
most-valuable-player candidate even before he steps onto the court. 
</P>
<P>
Two seasons ago when the game was played at the Seattle Kingdome, Tom Chambers, 
then a member of the Seattle SuperSonics, won the MVP award. Last season in 
Chicago, Jordan won the MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, however, said he is not rearranging his shelves to find space for the 
trophy just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just added pressure," Olajuwon said. "I don't think that way at all. 
I'm very happy just to be on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon said his MVP chances would have been heightened had Johnson played. It 
was Johnson's ballhandling and passing that helped Chambers win the award in 
1986 and Ralph Sampson win it in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think John Stockton is a good player, too," Olajuwon said. "He'll pass 
the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Because Stern added Abdul-Jabbar, West Coach Pat Riley of the Lakers is left 
with only Stockton, who will start in Johnson's place, as a true point guard. 
However, Riley is expected to use Portland's Clyde Drexler, Seattle's Dale 
Ellis and even Golden State forward Chris Mullin at that position. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting matchup could be at power forward between Barkley and Karl 
Malone. Known as two of the toughest players in the league, Barkley and Malone 
play the same aggressive style even though Malone is a well-sculpted 6-feet-9, 
250 pounds, and Barkley is a compact 6-6, 263. 
</P>
<P>
"Malone is tough, because he's just so physically strong," Barkley said. "Yeah, 
I think he's a little too strong for me. But I'm quicker, and I can beat him 
with my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Malone: "He's definitely got a bigger head than me, so, sure, he can 
say that." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley said the absence of Bird and Johnson won't make any difference to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just ridiculous to say that the game won't be the same," Barkley 
said. "Look who we have here. Jordan, Malone (Moses and Karl), Dominique 
(Wilkins), me. It's going to be a great game, regardless." 
</P>
<P>
All-Star Notes 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the Denver Nuggets will represent 
the league in next fall's McDonald's Open tournament in Rome. Last fall, the 
Boston Celtics played in Italy. . . . Stern also said that in April, the 
league's board of governors will consider a rule change concerning the 
24-second clock. As the rule stands now, the shot clock is re-set to 5 seconds 
anytime there is an inbounds play with less than 5 seconds on the clock. "The 
competition committee unanimously passed the rule change," Stern said. "The 
thinking was that, if the defensive team worked that hard, they shouldn't be 
penalized with the clock being re-set." . . . Laker Coach Pat Riley on not 
having Magic Johnson playing for him on the West All-Star team: "I feel like I 
don't have my right arm." 
</P>
<P>
More opinions from the irrepressible Charles Barkley: Not only does he want to 
eliminate the fans' balloting, he also wants an end to the coaches' voting for 
the reserves. "I think the players should pick the teams," Barkley said. "We 
play against each other. We know best who deserves to be here." . . . Barkley 
also advocated expanding the All-Star game from 12- to 15-minute quarters to 
ensure that each player gets significant playing time. "It's not fair when guys 
get selected to the All-Star team and then don't play much," Barkley said. 
"Last year, I was really upset that I didn't play much. Everybody should play 
(at least) 20 minutes."

<P>
It has become the great philosophical debate of our time, our time being the 
Central zone. 
</P>
<P>
Has Kareem Abdul-Jabbar been jabbed and jobbed and jerked around by the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
Have the league lords demeaned the big fella by inviting him to the All-Star 
game as a last-minute stand-in for the injured Magic Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
To save you a lot of valuable time and soul-searching, I'll give you the 
answer: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Some background: This is Kareem's 20th NBA season. He started out playing as if 
it were his 200th. His skyhook was grounded by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, which wanted to check for structural defects. 
</P>
<P>
He was overweight and under-inspired. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, he decided that this would not do. He launched a comeback, 
which has been at least moderately successful. 
</P>
<P>
He's not tearing the league up, but he's not tearing the Lakers down, either. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't voted an All-Star starter by the fans, of course, and he wasn't voted 
onto the squad by the coaches. Some time ago, the league asked him to join the 
West team as a special 13th man, but Kareem declined, because he knew he hadn't 
been playing like an All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
When Magic went down with a pulled hamstring, the league phoned Kareem again. 
This time he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
What the league should have done, of course, is make him a member of the 12-man 
squad right from the start, because this is his last season and he has scored 
more points than anyone ever. 
</P>
<P>
This would set a precedent, of course. Anytime a player scored 38,000 points in 
a career, the league would have to invite him to play on the All-Star team his 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
The league should have been more decisive, sooner. What could it hurt? These 
are the Western Conference All-Stars, not the U.S. Supreme Court justices. 
</P>
<P>
Objection to such sentiment has been voiced, most notably in the press, most 
notably by poison-pen artist Doug Moe, in his "Moe-ment by Moe-ment" Denver 
Post column (I swear I didn't make up that title) in Denver, where Doug also 
coaches the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody asked me if I thought Kareem should be on the All-Star team for 
sentimental reasons," Moe wrote. "You have to like somebody to have sentiment 
for him. That's why Dr. J made it (two years ago). . . . Kareem would be the 
last guy you'd pick for sentimental reasons. Here's a guy who has been pretty 
much a jerk almost his entire life. He's been one of the least-liked guys in 
the NBA by fans, media, the players. 
</P>
<P>
"If at one time or another you've ticked off everybody in basketball, how the 
hell are you supposed to be voted in for sentimental reasons?" 
</P>
<P>
Wow. 
</P>
<P>
If Kareem kills Moe's Nuggets in the playoffs, Moe will go down as the most 
inspirational journalist since David Cone of the Mets/New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem has never been the consummate gentleman and PR marvel that Dr. J was, 
but who has? If we were going to go on personality, Mother Teresa would start 
at point guard this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"It (being lovable) hasn't been the first priority in my career, as you 
probably know," Kareem said Saturday before the West workout. "It has probably 
cost me some popularity. Especially with Doug Moe." 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what evidence Doug Moe has gathered. But until I see it, I have to 
go with my own feeling, that Kareem has been pretty good for the game. Twenty 
years of great ball, less great in the last couple years, but great ball. No 
arrests, no convictions, solid citizen, bright guy, not a real bad role model. 
</P>
<P>
Probably stiffed an autograph seeker or two along the way, surely stiffed a 
press guy or two, but can be a decent interview. One of the more thoughtful 
guys, when you catch him in the right mood. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm getting sidetracked. We're talking about a basketball game to honor 
great players. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem seems kind of put off by the attention brought on by his awkward, 
last-minute addition to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"For a major part of the season, I have not been playing at All-Star caliber," 
he said. "I'm not going to try to dance around that. . . . It's always nice to 
be honored, but I thought by being honored at the (Saturday night) banquet, 
that would suit everyone's desires." 
</P>
<P>
Kareem accepted the invitation to suit up because -- and Doug Moe will dispute 
this -- he felt the league could use the help. Magic Johnson and Larry Bird are 
out of the All-Star game, the league needs some names. Kareem is glad to help. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not a fool. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 13th-man invitation earlier in the season, he said: "I wouldn't do that. 
I felt it should have been up to the coaches and fans. I had no problem living 
with that. . . . Things at the All-Star game are for the stars. I haven't been 
much of a star this year." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kareem has sweated off 15 pounds in the last month. He got his skyhook 
out of hock, adjusted his competitive attitude, regained some of his form. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm contributing (to the Lakers)," he says. "I don't have a whole lot 
of misgivings. I know I'm contributing, I'm not a liability. That bothered me. 
I didn't want to come out for the rest of the season and have people feel sorry 
for me, not do anything on the court." 
</P>
<P>
That crisis seems past, but now Kareem has to worry about Moe getting a court 
injunction to stop him from playing. 
</P>
<P>
In a sloppy, roundabout way, the right thing got done. Kareem will suit up, 
play a little, get a nice reception, add a little luster to the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Sympathy? That's not why the big fella is here. How about merit? How about 
10,000 skyhooks, five NBA championships? 
</P>
<P>
How about Kareem returing to the Astrodome, the scene of one of the great 
college basketball showdowns of all time? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Kareem does the rest of the season is up to him. Fall on his face or 
lead the Lakers to the title. 
</P>
<P>
But he's here, in uniform, and that's the way it should be. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if he decides to play next season. . .

WORLD ALPINE SKIING CHAMPIONSHIPS;

<P>
SCHNEIDER SAVES HER BEST FOR FINAL RACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After two near-misses, Vreni Schneider hit her stride Saturday and did what 
everyone expected her to do in the final women's race of the World Alpine 
Skiing Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's new skiing superwoman took a comfortable lead in the first run of 
the giant slalom on Vail Mountain and went on to win the gold medal as Tamara 
McKinney of the United States lasted just a few seconds before going down in a 
spray of snow and diving spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Walliser may provide the glamour for the Swiss female flying squadron -- 
which won 5 of the 15 available medals here, including 2 golds -- but Schneider 
supplies the bulk of the firepower. 
</P>
<P>
Between her silver medals in the combined and the slalom, and her victory 
Saturday, she rode shotgun to the accompaniment of country-and-western music on 
her Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
Well, perhaps it was more country-and-southern. "I like to listen to all kinds 
of tapes between races, but especially country music," she said in German, 
through a translator. "They help me to relax. Today, it just happened to be a 
group from the South Tyrol, a part of Italy where they speak German." 
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, apparently, as in the United States, you can take the girl out 
of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, 24, daughter of a onetime cobbler who is now a shopkeeper in the 
village of Elm, an hour and a half east of Zurich, is uncomfortable in the 
limelight and prefers just being alone, or with family and friends, in the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I am tired or lack motivation," she said, "all I have to do is go for 
a long walk in the mountains for a few hours in order to regain all my energy 
and joy in living. Many thoughts come to me then, and once I get home, I write 
them in my diary." 
</P>
<P>
The latest entry in her diary, under Feb. 11, 1989, will be about two runs, 
rather than walks, in the mountains of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, sturdily built with short, dark hair and a prominent nose, bulldozed 
her way to a lead of more than a half-second over France's Carole Merle with a 
time of 1:12.84 in the first run, then also had the fastest second run despite 
a mistake near the end and finished with a total time of 2:29.37. 
</P>
<P>
Merle, who is second to Schneider in the current World Cup overall standings, 
hung on for the silver medal by winding up 1.13 seconds behind the winner, and 
teammate Christelle Guignard, who was another 1.30 back, earned the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
Merle said that after the first run she didn't really think she could catch 
Schneider and added: "Vreni was skiing very good and very fast, so I 
concentrated on trying to keep second place away from Walliser and (Mateja) 
Svet." 
</P>
<P>
Walliser, the downhill gold medalist here, dropped from third to fifth in the 
second run, while Yugoslavia's Svet, the new world slalom champion, was unable 
to improve on her fourth place -- despite the arrival of her personal six-man 
rooting section, plus accordionist, from Ljubljana. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs enlivened the proceedings, as they did at the 1987 world 
championships and the 1988 Winter Olympics, by parading through the stands in 
their animal-skin folk costumes, waving flags, wiggling their hips to ring the 
big cowbells around their waists, and chanting, "Ma-te-ja, Ma-te-ja." Maybe you 
had to be there . . . 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Svet's Vets were part of uncounted thousands of spectators and skiers 
who have jammed the Vail Valley in relatively mild, sunny weather for the 
closing weekend of this biennial racing extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they'll watch Italy's Alberto Tomba, like Schneider an Olympic double 
gold medalist at Calgary last February, try to pull off his own last-race 
heroics in the men's slalom. He has been somewhat disappointing to his fans so 
far this winter and has only sixth and seventh places to show for his efforts 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, of course, has had a completely different season to date, winning 
all five slaloms and all five giant slaloms on the World Cup circuit, after 
spending last spring recovering from torn knee ligaments suffered in a March 
downhill race at Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
She has taken over as the leader of the Swiss women from her idol, Erika Hess, 
who retired on the day in '87 that Schneider first became the world giant 
slalom champion at Crans-Montana, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
That victory was a surprise, but her repeat performance wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Despite everyone's expectations, Schneider said: "I didn't feel any extra 
pressure today. Even if I didn't win, the earth wouldn't stop going around." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why her first run was so fast, when she is notorious for usually being 
slow the first time down, Schneider said: "This time, maybe I put some pressure 
on myself. I didn't want to be in the position of having to go beyond my limits 
in the second run, as I did in the slalom. I told myself to go for it and be 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good that I was ahead, because I had a problem in my second run at the 
gate near the top of the last steep face. I came in too straight and almost 
missed it. I thought, 'Oh, this is bad. I may have lost the race right here.' 
But I fought my way and down and was elated when I saw the No. 1 by my name on 
the scoreboard." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's tendency to fall behind in the first run of a race has become 
"almost a game with her," according to Swiss women's Coach Jan Tischhauser, who 
added: "She finds it amusing to come from behind, but it is not so amusing for 
her competitors, who must always wait to see what Vreni does, before they know 
how they will finish." 
</P>
<P>
This ability to rise above adversity began when Schneider was a teen-ager. Her 
mother died of cancer, and she was left to run the family household, a 
responsibility that cut into her promising skiing career. She was dropped from 
the national squad because of her inability to get good results and even 
considered giving up racing during this period in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to keep on trying," Schneider said, "because I realized how 
important the sport was to me, and I had promised my mother that I would do 
everything I could to be a champion." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider's victory Saturday was made somewhat easier when McKinney, who had 
won a gold medal in the combined and added a bronze in the slalom, fell before 
she had gone a quarter of the way down the first course and skidded into a 
cluster of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she was hurt in the spill, McKinney replied: "No, nothing serious. But 
maybe you'd better ask some of the spectators I ran into." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing serious there, either, it was reported. 
</P>
<P>
With McKinney out, the top U.S. placing went to Diann Roffe, the 1985 world 
giant slalom gold medalist, who finished 10th, just behind the new world 
super-G champion, Ulrike Maier of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrians, incidentally, have five medals overall, including two golds, and 
are second in the combined men's and women's medal count to the Swiss, who have 
11, including three golds.

TRAINERS RALLY AROUND LUKAS, LAZ BARRERA; 
</P>
<P>
REPORT OF MORE POSITIVE COCAINE TESTS ON HORSES DRAWS ANGRY REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incredulity and disbelief ran neck and neck, but outrage outstripped them both 
at Santa Anita Saturday as horsemen reacted angrily to the latest drug scandal 
to rock thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
Surprised by revelations that Laz Barrera and Wayne Lukas had become the fourth 
and fifth trainers to be accused recently of running horses that later were 
found to have had cocaine in their systems, horsemen launched a bitter attack 
on the California Horse Racing Board and its handling of the sport's growing 
drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
Although inadequate security at Southern California race tracks was frequently 
mentioned, it was the state's drug-testing laboratory that received 
near-unanimous condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
Several trainers said it was possible that the tests were inaccurate and that 
Barrera and Lukas had been wrongly accused. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there's something serious going wrong somewhere," trainer Chris 
Speckert said. "Why would those two trainers do it? I mean, there's no reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (state officials) were stupid to bring it out without 
investigating it further. Common sense tells you that men like D. Wayne Lukas 
and Laz Barrera didn't get where they are today by being stupid. They wouldn't 
do something like this. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it all boils down to the testing and the testing laboratory. We go 
to the Olympics and we go everywhere else and they have good laboratories and 
they spend a lot of money on it. But they (the CHRB) go to this one laboratory 
(the Truesdail Laboratory in Tustin) that every veterinarian from way back when 
recommended they not use, but they keep using it. . . . They're making 
themselves look stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach spokesmen at the Truesdail Laboratory were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations against Barrera and Lukas followed similar claims against three 
other trainers: Laz's son, Albert; Bryan Webb, and, last October, Roger Stein, 
who is appealing a six-month suspension and $2,000 fine imposed by the stewards 
and upheld by the CHRB. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday morning, the elder Barrera attended an informal hearing before the 
board of stewards at Santa Anita, where stewards said he appeared "crestfallen" 
and was quoted as saying, "I've never felt so hurt in my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
Steward Pete Pedersen said the three-man board had learned that Barrera's horse 
Endow had failed a post-race urinalysis at Del Mar last summer, and that the 
positive test for cocaine had been reaffirmed by a second test performed at 
Ohio State University. 
</P>
<P>
No date has yet been set for a formal hearing, Pedersen said, but Barrera will 
not be allowed to enter his horses in any race in California, pending the 
outcome of that hearing. Owners can switch their horses to another trainer, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Because written confirmation had not been received as of Saturday regarding the 
tests that Lukas' horse Crown Collection allegedly failed, also after a Del Mar 
race last summer, no action has been taken against him. He has yet to appear 
before the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera's formal hearing is scheduled for Feb. 23. He and Speckert both 
said that the sudden spate of positive tests has many trainers worried. 
</P>
<P>
"All the trainers are scared," Barrera said, "because if this happens to people 
like my father and Lukas, it can happen to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of this concern is not only what trainers regard as the suspect 
validity of the drug tests, but also the ease with which their horses could be 
drugged. Under racing rules, if a horse fails a drug test, the trainer is 
responsible regardless of the circumstances. Yet trainers cannot be at their 
barns 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"What's scary is that it could happen to me," Speckert said. "It could happen 
to absolutely anybody. That's what's frightening. You've got to watch who you 
employ and who you talk to. You could annoy somebody and they can just throw 
something in (the horse's feed)." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no security. There's nothing here. I can't lock them up. I can't do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Added trainer Brian Sweeney: "We run into problems with security in the barn 
area. We have a night watchman or somebody here all the time. But if somebody 
wanted to do something untoward, all they have to do is just walk down a shed 
row. The feed tubs are all along the side." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally doubts that additional security will solve the problem. 
Like Speckert, he believes it could just as easily originate at the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if more security is the answer or not," McAnally said. "It's 
obvious that there is either something going on at the laboratory or there's 
something going on in the stable area. . . . "Truthfully, I do not know which, 
but I do know one thing: that they should straighten it out as soon as they 
possibly can to clear up the bad name for racing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's just knocking down everything we've done for the last 100 years to 
improve racing." 
</P>
<P>
Stein said he saw a little humor Saturday in the uproar that came after the 
linking of Laz Barrera's and Lukas' names to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"To see the outrage of the horsemen this morning, all rallying behind two guys 
who they know are above reproach, it's interesting," he said. "Because when it 
was me, I guess apparently some people thought it was possible. 
</P>
<P>
"But there aren't any horsemen that I've met that would give a horse cocaine. 
No trainer, I don't care if he's got one horse or 50, is going to go out on a 
limb by using something like cocaine that they know is going to test 
(positive)." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Apprentice jockey Fernando Valenzuela rode his first stakes winner Saturday 
when he and Sunny Blossom crossed the line first in the $80,850 El Conejo 
Handicap. Trained by Eddie Gregson, the brown 4-year-old gelding covered the 5 
1/2 furlongs on a muddy track in a hand-timed 1:04 3/5 to win by 2 1/2 lengths 
and earn $47,100. Sensational Star, with Russell Baze aboard, was second, a 
half-length ahead of Alex Solis on Prospector's Gamble.

Flying Cloud 135 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since Nov. 23, Thursday's Child, a 10-ton, stripped-down racing machine, has 
logged some 15,000 miles in a voyage around dreaded Cape Horn. The period 
included a stop at the Falkland Islands to make repairs from a collision with 
an unknown object.

BUBKA REGAINS INDOOR VAULT RECORD AT 19-9 1/4

Sergei Bubka of the Soviet Union regained the world indoor pole vault record 
Saturday, then failed three times at clearing 20 feet in the Yomiuri-Chitose 
track and field meet. 
</P>
<P>
Bubka, using the same pole as the one he used in winning the gold medal at the 
1988 Seoul Olympics, cleared 19 feet 9 1/4 inches on his third and final 
attempt in front of 11,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Bubka, the world record-holder at 19-10 1/2 and the two-time world outdoor 
champion, bettered the previous world indoor record of 19-9 set by compatriot 
Rodion Gataullin Feb. 4 at Gomel, USSR. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's performance was not so good technically, but my physical condition was 
good," Bubka said. "I also like this arena." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bubka failed to clear 20 feet, he said: "If all conditions are fit for 
me, it will be possible to clear 6.20 meters (20-4 1/4 this season). I did it 
during training." 
</P>
<P>
He will not have the chance to reach the barrier in next month's World Indoor 
Championships at Budapest, Hungary, because he is skipping the meet. 
</P>
<P>
American Tim Bright cleared 18-8 1/4 to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
Other men's winners included Americans Joe DeLoach in the 60-meter dash, Danny 
Everett in the 400 meters, Mike Powell in the long jump and Willie Banks in the 
triple jump, and Sweden's Patrik Sjoberg in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
Women's winners included Evelyn Ashford in the 60 and Tamara Bykova of the 
Soviet Union in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoach, who defeated Carl Lewis in winning the gold medal in the 200 meters at 
Seoul, won the 60 in 6.60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was satisfied with my second career race in the 60 meters," DeLoach said. "I 
was aggressive at the start." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will focus on the 200 at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, a bronze medalist at Seoul, led all the way in winning the 400 in 
48.97. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with the result," Everett said of his first indoor competition 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, a silver medalist at Seoul, leaped 26-4 1/2 in winning the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, the world record-holder at 58-11 1/2, won the triple jump at 53-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
"My (physical) condition was good, but for some reason I couldn't jump well," 
Banks said. 
</P>
<P>
Sjoberg's winning height in the high jump was 7-4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Ashford, winner of three gold medals and one silver in the last two Olympics, 
won the women's 60 in 7.27, beating Jamaican Grace Jackson, who was second in 
7.41. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to break my best time of 10.71 in the 100 meters and eventually 
beat (world record-holder) Florence Griffith Joyner," Ashford said. 
</P>
<P>
Bykova won the women's high jump at 6-4 1/4, and American Louise Ritter, the 
Olympic gold medalist, finished fourth at 6-0 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
"I did expect to win today," Ritter said. "I was quite disappointed. It was the 
worst result this season after eight competitions. I had a bad stomach this 
morning. I think it's a virus."

<P>
HERE'S AN ALL-STAR TEAM FOR THE UNHERALDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SULLIVAN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, deserving players are left off the National Basketball Association 
All-Star team. So with that in mind, let's shift focus and honor five players 
who are having solid, quiet seasons for improving teams. 
</P>
<P>
Forward, Larry Krystkowiak, Milwaukee -- Like the second 'k' in his name, 
Milwaukee's power forward from Montana is a silent, overlooked presence on the 
league's most surprising team. He's a dependable scorer (11.7 points per game) 
and rebounder (7.1), but his true value is on defense, where he routinely 
guards the opposition's scoring forward. If you've been checking box scores, 
you know the opposition's big scorers rarely reach their average against the 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Forward, Thurl Bailey, Utah -- A 6-11 version of Lakers small forward James 
Worthy, goggles and all. Playing alongside three All-Stars (Karl Malone, John 
Stockton, Mark Eaton), Bailey might be the least known 20-point scorer in the 
game. He's also a capable rebounder and shot-blocker who, paired with Malone, 
creates matchup problems for opposing front lines. 
</P>
<P>
Center, Mark West, Phoenix -- Despite playing 24 minutes a game, West is ninth 
in the league in blocked shots. While on the floor, he serves the same 
defensive purpose as the Knicks' Patrick Ewing -- as a backstop for a team with 
a daring, wide-open style. There's no way Phoenix would have made the Larry 
Nance trade with Cleveland if West had not been included. Not a constant 
offensive threat, but his 65.3 percent field-goal shooting would lead the 
league if he had enough attempts to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Guard, Lester Conner, New Jersey -- Not even Harry Weltman, who made sure to 
include Conner in the Joe Barry Carroll deal, could have imagined Conner would 
become the Nets' most valuable player. In the past week, Conner had his first 
two career triple-doubles -- both against Seattle -- and is the only point 
guard besides Denver's Fat Lever with more than 100 steals, 200 rebounds and 
300 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Guard, Winston Garland, Golden State -- Chris Mullin and Mitch Richmond have 
received most of the publicity, but the second-year guard has been instrumental 
in the Warriors' stunning about-face. Garland, who was waived twice as a 
rookie, leads the team in assists and steals while averaging more than 15 
points and just 2.5 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Washington is having so much trouble keeping his weight down that Miami 
Heat public relations men should consider changing his name to Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who has been hobbled by a groin pull for most of the season, 
apparently is healthy enough to resume playing. But Miami's coaches won't 
reactivate him until he gets his weight down to an acceptable level. 
</P>
<P>
The former Syracuse star is listed officially as 200 pounds, but he was tipping 
the scales at 213 last week and is still seven to 10 pounds overweight. So he 
remains on the injured list. Washington missed 10 games with the groin injury 
in December. After returning for five games, he reinjured it and has missed 17 
games since. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major concern," said Miami Coach Ron Rothstein, "because if he's not at 
the prescribed weight, he's only going to get hurt again. It's a very tender 
situation for him. Weight has always been a problem, and if he's going to do 
anything, he has to learn. What's the sense of putting him out on the floor 
with the extra weight so he can pull his groin again?" 
</P>
<P>
Washington is in the final year of the original three-year deal he signed with 
the Nets. He's also in the final year of a sneaker contract, and his future 
never has seemed cloudier. 
</P>
<P>
Losing to the Nets sure brings out the worst in a team. After Seattle lost at 
the Meadowlands Tuesday night -- the Sonics' second loss to the Nets in eight 
days -- Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel got into a shouting match that caused 
Coach Bernie Bickerstaff to close the locker room to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel said he took exception to comments Ellis had made about his teammates 
after the 109-99 loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't speaking for myself, I was speaking for me and my teammates," 
McDaniel explained. "When someone says his teammates don't have heart, that 
they're sissies, he's singling himself out from the team, as if he's the only 
one who has heart and is the only one out there winning. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he's scoring a lot of points," McDaniel said of Ellis, the NBA's 
third-leading scorer, "but if people like me don't set picks and rebound, he 
doesn't get those points. ... I just don't think another player should say 
anything like that. It's putting me down and putting the rest of the players 
down." 
</P>
<P>
This hasn't been an easy season for McDaniel. A year ago at this time, he was 
averaging 24.3 points and 7.7 rebounds, shooting 51.8 percent from the floor 
and heading for the All-Star Game for the first time. But he injured his knee 
soon after, slumped badly the rest of the season and became a sixth man this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
With his playing time reduced to 28 minutes, he's averaging only 18.6 points 
and 5.3 rebounds on 46.9 percent shooting. And Ellis has supplanted him as 
Seattle's All-Star representative. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel: "I accepted the position, and there's nothing else I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Golden State's Manute Bol was shooting 27.8 percent (5 for 18) from three-point 
land, a better percentage than Chris Mullin (19.1 percent), Isiah Thomas 
(25.0), Gerald Wilkins (25.3) and Michael Jordan (25.0).

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MICHIGAN, IOWA FIND LIFE ON ROAD TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who thinks winning on the road in the Big Ten isn't difficult should try 
persuading Bill Frieder, the coach of 10th-ranked Michigan, and Tom Davis, the 
coach of eighth-ranked Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were upset Saturday, as the Wolverines were beaten by Minnesota, 
88-80, and the Hawkeyes lost to Wisconsin, 65-54. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Williams Arena is becoming a tough place to play for ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota won its fourth consecutive home game against a ranked team when it 
beat Michigan. The Gophers have defeated Illinois (then No. 1), Iowa (No. 5), 
Ohio State (No. 15) and Michigan in their last four games in Williams Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, 6-5 in the Big Ten, has been the conference's surprise team. 
</P>
<P>
"If this ballclub doesn't win another game, it's surpassed all my 
expectations," Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins said. "We're 14-7. We're going to 
be a .500 ballclub even if we lose our last seven games. You can't take that 
away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Willie Burton scored five of his 27 points during a 33-second span late in the 
game to put Minnesota ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
"We play hard at home and we win," Burton said. "I'm happy about it. But we're 
better than a .500 team." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder thinks Minnesota is better than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Minnesota really played a great game," he said. "They certainly didn't 
surprise us. That's the way they played against Iowa and Illinois and some of 
the rest of them up here." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is 18-5 overall and 6-4 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
At Madison, Wis., the Badgers not only upset the Hawkeyes, but limited them to 
their lowest point output of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (17-6, 5-5) never got closer than five in the second half in losing its 
second straight. The Hawkeyes entered the game averaging 91 points and had not 
been held below 67. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the aggressors at both ends and they never let us get running," 
Davis said. "It looked for a while like we would but then all of a sudden we 
didn't score in a while. With the tempo of the game, we couldn't get into the 
flow with our running game." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawkeyes moved to within eight points with 3:42 left on B.J. Armstrong's 
basket, but Trent Jackson and Tom Molaski made four free throws each and the 
Badgers increased their lead to 58-43 with 1:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson led all scorers with 24 points. Wisconsin (13-7, 5-6) ended a six-game 
losing streak to Iowa, including a 78-70 loss earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri 93, Kansas 80 -- Senior guard Byron Irvin scored 22 points, including 
several key baskets in the second half, to help the No. 3 Tigers win the Big 
Eight game at Columbia, Mo., and give assistant coach Rich Daly his first 
victory in relief of the hospitalized Norm Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri, 21-4 overall and 7-1 in the Big Eight, won as Stewart watched from a 
hospital bed for the second consecutive game. He was stricken with a bleeding 
ulcer Thursday on Missouri's flight to Oklahoma, one day after the suspension 
of top assistant Bob Sundvold. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive loss for Kansas (16-8, 3-6). 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 86, Northwestern 69 -- The No. 7 Illini broke the game open in the 
second half, going on a 23-4 run to build a 60-35 advantage with 13 minutes 
remaining in the Big Ten game at Champaign, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Lowell Hamilton sparked the surge with two quick baskets and Nick Anderson 
added a free throw before the Wildcats could score their first basket. Kenny 
Battle then added two free throws and a basket and Marcus Liberty made two more 
baskets, including a three-pointer, before the Wildcats scored again. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, 20-3 and 7-3, reached the 20-victory mark for the seventh straight 
season. Northwestern, led by Walker Lambiotte's 24 points, is 8-13 and 1-10. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 92, St. John's 69 -- The No. 9 Orangemen used their fast break to run 
away from the Redmen in the Big East game at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, which avenged a 65-63 loss to St. John's earlier this season, 
improved to 21-4 and 7-4 in the Big East. St. John's is 13-8 and 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse began the second half with a 12-2 run and went on to lead by 33 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 83, Villanova 77 -- The No. 11 Pirates, who had lost eight straight 
to the Wildcats, and had not won on Villanova's home court in 15 years, came 
from behind to win the Big East game at Villanova, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall, helped by three-point shots by Gerald Greene and Morton, took its 
first lead three minutes into the second half and was ahead the rest of the 
way. Kenny Wilson's two free throws brought Villanova within 67-63 with 4:39 
remaining, but Seton Hall then went on a 9-1 spurt. 
</P>
<P>
John Morton scored 23 points for Seton Hall, 21-4 overall and 8-4 in the Big 
East. Villanova is 13-11 and 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State 76, Marquette 73 -- Eric Knox scored 28 points, including 18 on 
three-point baskets, and Gary Payton added 24 at Milwaukee as the Beavers gave 
Coach Ralph Miller his 668th career victory, making him sixth on the all-time 
list. 
</P>
<P>
Knox made his fifth three-point goal to give the Beavers (16-5) a 66-63 lead. 
Tony Smith pulled Marquette to within 66-65 with 4:48 left. Knox scored the 
next five points. 
</P>
<P>
Smith got Marquette (9-10) to within 73-71 on a jam off a steal, but the 
Warriors could get no closer. A Knox basket and three free throws by Payton 
accounted for the Beavers' final points. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 86, Maryland 60 -- A 16-0 run that covered five minutes during the first 
half helped the No. 14 Blue Devils in the Atlantic Coast Conference victory at 
Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
All five starters contributed to the run that helped Duke take a 22-8 lead. The 
Blue Devils, who shot 57.9% for the game, are 17-4 overall and 6-4 in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland is 8-14 and 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 81, Michigan St. 75 -- Jerry Francis scored a career-high 27 points 
and led a late surge that helped the No. 16 Buckeyes in a Big Ten game at 
Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State, unbeaten in nine home games, improved to 17-6 overall and 6-4 in 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State, which lost its third straight game, is 12-8 and 3-7. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia 100, Penn State 67 -- Steve Berger scored 22 points, Chris Brooks 
had 20 and Herbie Brooks added 19 as the No. 15 Mountaineers extended the 
nation's longest winning streak to 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia, 18-2 overall, 12-0 in the Atlantic 10, has won the last eight 
games against Penn State played in Morgantown, W.Va., and 12 of the last 14 
games in the series. The Nittany Lions are 13-10 and 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 75, Wake Forest 70 -- Dennis Scott scored 22 points and Tom 
Hammonds 19 as the No. 20 Yellow Jackets held off a late rally in the ACC game 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech, 16-7 overall and 5-3 in the ACC, held a 10-point lead with a 
little less than 6 minutes remaining before Wake Forest cut the lead to 72-70 
on Sam Ivy's basket with 44 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Demon Deacons (11-10, 2-7) failed to score after that and the Jackets made 
the front end of three one-and-one free throw situations in the final 34 
seconds, one each by Brian Oliver, Hammonds and Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State 122, Tennessee 106 -- Freshman guard Chris Jackson scored 50 
points at Baton Rouge, La., to help keep the Tigers in first place in the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's 50 points was the most ever scored in the LSU Assembly Center. Pete 
Maravich, college basketball's all-time leading scorer, finished his career at 
LSU before the Assembly Center was built. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, second-leading scorer in the country, had a 53-point game against 
Florida earlier this season. He is averaging just under 28 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
LSU is 17-6 overall and 9-3 in the SEC. Tennessee is 14-7 and 7-5.

<TEXT>
<P>
USC put on a good show against Notre Dame Saturday, but still ended up losing, 
83-74, before a capacity 11,418 at Notre Dame's Joyce Center. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was a carbon copy of our season," USC Coach George Raveling said. 
"This one was like so many other games we've had. We are an unusual team. We'll 
give anyone a game, but we fall short in the end. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like a salesman. We make a good presentation, but we can't make the 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Moore scored 23 points and Andy Pendleton, who made 4 of 10 three-point 
shots, had 20 points to keep the Trojans in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was coming off a poor performance, when he missed 7 of 10 shots, in USC's 
68-65 loss to UCLA Wednesday night, and didn't start Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But he ended up making 10 of 15 shots in 27 minutes. Calvin Banks, who started 
in place of Moore, played 17 minutes and did not score. 
</P>
<P>
For Notre Dame, Joe Fredrick scored 23, including four free throws in the final 
minute. Freshman guard Elmer Bennett came off the bench to score 19. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Digger Phelps was particularly pleased with Bennett, who 
played 23 minutes. "He hit some key baskets, including a three-pointer after 
USC had cut the margin," he said. "That's as good a performance as I've seen 
here by a freshman off the bench." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman LaPhonso Ellis was held to eight points. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish played without starting guard Jamere Jackson, who came down with back 
spasms Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame is 14-4; USC is 7-16. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Fuller brought the Trojans within three points on a 15-foot shot with 45 
seconds left for USC's final score. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame opened double-digit leads three times but couldn't put away the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Free-throw shooting cost the Trojans a chance to tie the game, 70-70, when 
Moore missed the free throw on what could have been a three-point play, and 
then Ronnie Coleman missed one of two. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame opened a 12-point lead midway through the first half, but the 
Trojans fought back, outscoring the Irish, 13-3, to get within one on a layup 
by Alan Pollard. But the Irish scored the final three points of the half to 
lead, 41-37. 
</P>
<P>
About USC, Phelps said: "They do have some talented athletes, but they just 
seem to end up in a negative with one key shot or one key play. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate today because Pendleton can hurt you when he gets going. 
(Chris) Munk is a very physical player who we recruited. And Moore really 
played well today." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Trojans once again came up short.

<P>
Georgetown is the nation's No. 2 team with Alonzo Mourning in its lineup. But 
the Hoyas proved Saturday that they're very beatable with the 6-foot-10 
freshman center on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's Jason Matthews scored 24 points as Georgetown, playing most of the 
second half without Mourning, was held to eight points in the final 10 minutes 
in losing to the Panthers, 79-74, in a Big East Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews and Rod Brookin scored six points each during a 12-0 run midway 
through the second half that rallied the Panthers from a 10-point deficit to a 
68-66 lead on Matthews' fifth three-pointer of the game with 5:58 to play. 
</P>
<P>
With Mourning on the bench after fouling out with 8:13 to play, Pitt pulled off 
its fourth upset of a Top 10 team in the last five weeks. Last month, the 
Panthers upset then-No. 2 Syracuse, then-No. 3 Oklahoma and then No.-9 Seton 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"They set the tone early. They got the three-point shots and really hit those, 
and the fouls go with the game," Georgetown Coach John Thompson said. "The ref 
calls it as he sees it, but none of us ever actually see it like that. We 
certainly would have liked to have had the big guy in there, though." 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 66-56 lead on Dikembe Mutombo's dunk with 10 minutes left, the 
Hoyas -- who had won eight consecutive Big East games -- were outscored, 23-8, 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt, 12-10 overall and 5-6 in the Big East, outrebounded the taller Hoyas, 
38-29, as 6-9 sophomore Bobby Martin had 16 points and 11 rebounds. Martin held 
Mourning, the Big East's most dominating freshman since Patrick Ewing, to 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown, 18-3 after losing for just the second time in 11 games, scored 13 
consecutive first-half points to take a 38-28 lead. The Hoyas, 8-2 in the Big 
East, stretched the lead to 12 points at 49-37 early in the second half, but 
Mourning drew his fourth personal foul with 14 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning fouled out just seconds after re-entering the game with 8:20 to play, 
helping Pitt run off its 12-0 burst.

CS LONG BEACH BEATS FRESNO STATE

It took a long time, but Cal State Long Beach finally reached .500 Saturday 
night by defeating Fresno State, 59-51, before a sellout crowd of 1,908 at Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to overcome a lot of injuries, before the season and now . . . it's 
been a grind," Coach Joe Harrington said after the 49ers improved to 11-11 
overall -- the first time they have been at .500 this season -- and 8-5 in the 
Big West Conference. It was also their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won the game at the free-throw line. They made only two field goals 
in the last 11 minutes but made 16 of 22 from the line during that time. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting to the one-and-one with 11 minutes to go made a big difference for 
us," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who have been practicing free-throw shooting, made 73% from the line 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been coming in at night and a couple of mornings at 6:30, so we've been 
shooting a lot more free throws," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tyrone Mitchell, who led the 49ers with 12 points, made seven of the free 
throws that kept Fresno State (11-10 and 6-6) at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which lost, 56-55, at Fresno earlier in the season, improved from a 
26-20 halftime lead to a 45-34 lead with 8:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Jervis Cole, who led Fresno with 15 points, made a three-point play to 
start a 7-0 spurt that got the Bulldogs to within 45-41 at 5:33. 
</P>
<P>
But in the next three minutes the 49ers scored five free throws -- two by Marco 
Fleming and three by Mitchell -- and got a rebound basket from Rudy Harvey to 
make it 52-41. Fresno never got closer than nine points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' press forced 16 Fresno turnovers, and Long Beach outrebounded the 
taller Bulldogs, 31-29. 
</P>
<P>
All of the 49ers' top nine players scored. John Hatten had 10 points, Harvey 
had nine and Fleming scored eight.

Josh Lowery scored 25 points and Erik Spoelstra made four free throws in the 
final 18 seconds of overtime Saturday to lead Portland past San Francisco, 
87-84, in a West Coast Athletic Conference game at Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted Portland to 2-21 overall and 2-8 in the WCAC. San Francisco 
is 13-10 and 5-5. 
</P>

UC IRVINE FALLS SHORT AGAINST FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when UC Irvine had drawn the envy of the Big West Conference by upsetting 
Nevada Las Vegas last week, Cal State Fullerton did the same. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton upset Las Vegas in overtime Thursday night, setting up a charged 
meeting against Irvine Saturday in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine unleashed a flurry of three-point shots against the Titans, making 13 in 
the game. But the Anteaters fell, 78-75, when Kevin Floyd's three-point shot in 
the final seconds failed him, going into the basket and rimmimg back out just 
before the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler rebounded and looked to pass for one more attempt, but even had 
there been time, Floyd already had turned away in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd's final attempt was the Anteaters' 26th three-point attempt of the game. 
It could not have been closer than it was, but it was a miss just the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (Fullerton) did a nice job," said Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, whose 
team had taken a 77-73 victory in the first game between the teams. "They 
deserved to win. We just got beat." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's freshman point guard, Wayne Williams, led the Titans with 20 
points, including four of four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which had fallen behind by nine in the first half when Irvine made 
five consecutive three-pointers, held a 74-72 lead with 1 minute to go after 
Irvine's Butler tipped in an offensive rebound. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams made four free throws in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who made a game-winning 25-footer at the overtime buzzer against Las 
Vegas, made two free throws with 27 seconds left for a 76-72 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But then Rod Palmer made a three-pointer with 16 seconds left, cutting it to 
76-75. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, fouled by Floyd after the ball was inbounded to him with 14 seconds 
left, made two more free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Jones, the Titans' senior team captain, had walked to the line to cradle 
Williams' head in his arms after he made the first of his four free throws. 
After his third, Jones gave Williams a playful push. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the game-winner against Las Vegas, Williams made a 35-footer at the 
halftime buzzer against UC Santa Barbara. And for good measure, he made a 
three-pointer at the halftime buzzer against Irvine, giving a 39-38 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Such heroics put him in good stead when he stood at the free-throw line with 
the game on his shoulders in the final minute 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very confident," Williams said. "I feel if I can knock down the three, 
I'm sure I can hit easy free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan offered no argument. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Williams is the guy that beat us," he said. "What a freshman he is." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (11-10, 6-6) turned its one-point halftime lead into a six-point lead 
early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
But shortly after, Palmer, who finished with 15 points, made a three-pointer, 
followed by Jeff Herdman, who had five three-pointers among his 17 points. That 
made it 46-44, Irvine. Two more Herdman three-pointers kept Irvine out front, 
but then Fullerton's Mark Hill drove, made the shot and was fouled. His free 
throw made it 57-55, and Fullerton never trailed again. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (9-12, 6-6) tied the score three more times -- on three-pointers by Mike 
Doktorczyk and Floyd and an offensive rebound basket by Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
A layup by Williams put the Titans ahead, 70-68, and they staved off the 
three-pointers to win. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, I was concerned that we might be savoring the UNLV win too long," 
Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently not. 
</P>
<P>
The first time Fullerton and Irvine met this season, Mulligan spotted a hole in 
the middle of the Titans' matchup zone defense, and Butler exploited it, 
scoring 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Titans, collapsing on every pass inside, closed that hole at the 
outset. But with one hole patched, another burst open. Irvine, which has the 
country's two best three-point shooters in Herdman and Doktorczyk, bombed away 
from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed, a quick enough study, abandoned the zone for a man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' Cedric Ceballos, the conference's leading scorer, who scored 11 
points on five-of-22 shooting.

AT 97, TEACHER JOE NORWOOD IS PROVING IT'S A GAME FOR LIFETIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mal Florence 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Norwood could refer to George Burns as a kid without blinking an eye. 
</P>
<P>
That's his privilege, considering that the 97-year-old Norwood is still active 
as a golf instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he is now confined to a wheelchair, Norwood is teaching golfers his 
concept of the golf swing every Saturday at the Studio City driving range. 
</P>
<P>
Pros and hackers have been his pupils since he became a teacher in the early 
1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood, who grew up in Boston, recalls that he played Sunday rounds of golf 
with Francis Ouimet, got putting instructions from Walter Travis and helped 
Horton Smith refine his game. 
</P>
<P>
Ouimet, as a young amateur, beat Harry Vardon and Ted Ray in a playoff for the 
U.S. Open championship in 1913. His surprising victory over the esteemed 
British golfers helped popularize the game in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Travis won the U.S. and British Amateur championships at the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Smith came along later and became the first winner of the Masters in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood was exposed to the game when he was 13 and got a job in the golf 
department of the Wright and Ditson sports store in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, Alex Findlay, a renowned Scottish golfer and developer of golf 
courses of that era, influenced him to become an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball had been Norwood's game, but he said that Findlay told him, "You can 
play baseball for 15 years, but golf will last for a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
Norwood smiled and added, "And I'm still going at 97." 
</P>
<P>
He was at the Riviera Country Club last week to watch the Nissan Los Angeles 
Open. It was only fitting that he would be there, since he helped organize and 
conduct the first Los Angeles Open in 1926 at the Los Angeles Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
As the pro at LACC, a job he held from 1921 to 1946, Norwood instructed Roger 
Kelly and Charles Seaver, who became top amateur golfers. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly won the California State Amateur championship in 1936 and 1937 and the 
Los Angeles City title in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Seaver, the father of former major league pitcher Tom Seaver, was a member of 
winning Walker Cup teams in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
There have been countless other players who credit their development to 
Norwood, such as Charlie Sifford, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Ralph Terry and Mac 
O'Grady. 
</P>
<P>
Terry, a former star pitcher with the New York Yankees, said that Norwood is 
"Truth in the golf swing," adding he wouldn't be on the Senior Tour now without 
Norwood's help. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood, a friendly man with bushy eyebrows and large hands, recalled when 
O'Grady came to him for instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'I have a golf swing, but I want it better,' " Norwood said. "He 
was with me for a year and he now has every move that I teach, which is few." 
</P>
<P>
O'Grady now teaches his fellow pros and it's presumed that some of the concepts 
of the Norwood method are incorporated into his own teaching format. 
</P>
<P>
There are as many theories on the golf swing as there are golfers, many of them 
contradictory. Paralysis by analysis is endemic to the game. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood tries to keep it simple, teaching a no-rotation method that includes a 
horizontal backswing and vertical downswing. 
</P>
<P>
He is fond of saying, "Bad golf is a gift. Good golf is acquired." 
</P>
<P>
Norwood has made a golf instructional video and he has what he calls a 
Preservation of Golf History Foundation. He is willing to share his knowledge, 
free, to high school players throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood doesn't drink or smoke and has eaten the same breakfast every day for 
the better part of his life: oatmeal, two poached eggs and a cup of cocoa. 
</P>
<P>
He is the last surviving charter member of the Southern California chapter of 
the Professional Golfers' Assn. that was founded in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
While at the driving range at Riviera preceding the L.A. Open, his keen eyes 
watched the pros practice. 
</P>
<P>
He turned his attention to Jeff Sluman, the 1988 PGA champion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's turning his right shoulder around the ball, instead of in back of it," 
Norwood said. "He rotates his right hip at address instead of sitting on it." 
</P>
<P>
Sluman was out of hearing range from Norwood, but he could get more 
personalized instruction by just stopping by the Studio City driving range any 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood says he can improve anyone's golf swing in five minutes. After all, he 
has been doing it for nearly 80 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia, who has been on the PGA Tour for eight years, has won 
$1,875,672, which is only $17,000 less than Arnold Palmer did in a lifetime on 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Arnie just came along at the wrong time, said Calcavecchia, who has already 
won the Phoenix and L.A. Opens this year. "There is no comparison to the money 
we're playing for now. But the competition is far greater now than when Arnie 
and Jack Nicklaus were winning tournaments, and they'll tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many great players out here now. On the other hand, how many 
tournaments did Arnold Palmer have to win to make $180,000? (the winner's share 
at the L.A. Open). Before the Seniors Tour, $50,000 was the largest check Arnie 
ever made in a golf tournament other than a skins tournament. That's mind 
boggling." 
</P>
<P>
"The money (now) is phenomenal. It blows me away and I like to spend it." 
</P>
<P>
Calcavecchia, who is the leading money winner on the tour this year, earning 
$358,952, says that you can't compare golfers from one era to those of another. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the equipment and conditions are better today, but the greens 
might have been slower and the rough not as formidable in other years. 
</P>
<P>
And he believes that leadership on the tour changes about every five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's the Sandy Lyles and, hopefully, the Mark Calcavecchias," he said. 
"Tom Watson is sort of sliding out now. A new era of players is coming in and 
an old era is going out." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
The United States Golf Assn. has announced an increase in purses for the U.S. 
Open, Women's Open and Senior Open. The purse for this year's Open will be $1.1

BAYLOR WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN SWING OF THINGS FOR 1 MORE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Newhan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Baylor has been offered a front-office position with the Angels, but he 
would prefer to spend one more season as a designated hitter before becoming a 
full-time sitter. 
</P>
<P>
He would also like to extend one of baseball's intriguing streaks. 
</P>
<P>
As an acknowledged clubhouse leader and clutch hitter, Baylor has reached each 
of the last three World Series with different teams -- the Boston Red Sox, 
Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm working out every day in the hope that someone will decide they want to 
win again," Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the only offer has come from Jackie Autry, wife of Angel owner 
Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie called and asked if I'd like to come to work with (General Manager) 
Mike Port," Baylor said. "She said that she and Gene had felt that Reggie 
(Jackson) had probably played a couple years longer than he should have, and I 
took that to mean they probably felt the same about me. I told her we're all 
different. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get into specifics about the job, but I told her I'd get back to her 
about the time spring training started." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels are expanding their front office by hiring two assistants for Port. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor, who played for the Angels from 1977 through 1982 and was the American 
League's most valuable player in '82, would fill two roles himself -- that of 
assistant to Port and an attractive response to baseball's affirmative action 
process. He might also be a valuable liaison between Port and the players. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the irony in the club's offer is that Baylor had indeed hoped to 
return to the Angels, but as a player. The Angels were his first choice, he 
said, when the Athletics elected not to re-sign him. "But Mike told me that 
they already had Brian Downing and too many other DH types," Baylor said. "But 
that's not looking at anything else. They lost a leader in Bob Boone and who do 
they have to replace him?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the A's relentless march to the American League's Western Division 
title, the 1988 season was not a satisfying one for Baylor, 39. He appeared in 
only 92 games, batting .220 with 7 home runs and 34 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
A .290 hitter in postseason competition, Baylor had only one at-bat in the 
World Series. Now he waits for one more spring training invitation and wonders 
if his union activity and penchant for expressing his opinions is finally 
working against him. He remains hopeful, however, that someone will remember 
that October streak and call him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played in three straight World Series and I'd think that would be enough 
qualifications for me," Baylor said. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to avoid the injuries that reduced his playing time to 135 games 
last year and 129 in 1988, center fielder Eric Davis of the Cincinnati Reds has 
gone from 175 to 190 pounds this winter by lifting weights at his Woodland 
Hills home and running the neighborhood hills. 
</P>
<P>
Building strength and stamina, however, have not entirely allowed Davis to 
forget his relationship with the Reds, which isn't the best. 
</P>
<P>
According to agent Eric Goldschmidt, Davis told General Manager Murray Cook on 
Tuesday that he wanted to be traded if they could not agree on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who made $899,000 last year, has an arbitration hearing scheduled in New 
York Thursday. He filed at $1.65 million. The Reds countered at $1.15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the contract differences and Davis' belief that the Reds forced him to 
play hurt in 1987, Goldschmidt said: "He's not a happy camper. He's tired of 
the treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Davis and longtime pal Darryl Strawberry of the New York Mets have said they 
hope to eventually come home and play together in the Dodger outfield. Davis 
can't force a trade now, but he will be within a year of free agency after this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't get satisfaction now, he certainly won't sign a multiyear 
contract then," Goldschmidt said. "Then what do the Reds do?" 
</P>
<P>
Since being traded from the Baltimore Orioles to his hometown Dodgers, Eddie 
Murray has been seen at a number of Southern California sporting events, but 
has failed to attend any of the club's three-a-week winter workouts at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he expected to attend the club's annual open house today. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Dodgers disappointed that they have not seen more of Murray? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," Executive Vice President Fred Claire said. "The workouts are 
voluntary, so it's not a problem with me, not a concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked with Eddie on several occasions and have tremendous amount of 
confidence in that he knows what's best for him and what he has to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is that his attitude and enthusiasm are very high. I 
feel his enthusiasm for being with the Dodgers will offset not being at the 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie feels that he has enough time to get ready in spring training. He has 
also been very involved playing golf, building a new home here and in just the 
transition of the move." 
</P>
<P>
There are some in the Baltimore organization who have suggested that Murray, at 
33, needs to work harder during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
They cite April of 1987, when Murray experienced his worst month, batting .181. 
And they point to his slow start of last season, when he hit 28 home runs and 
drove in 84 runs but was batting only .231 with four homers and 19 RBIs on June 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were other considerations last year. The weight of the 
Orioles' miserable start fell heaviest on Murray. He became the object of the 
fans' frustration and scorn, some of it racial. 
</P>
<P>
"His relationship with the city and club deteriorated so badly that a lot of 
the gas went out of the engine," a longtime Murray associate said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no correlation between the slow start and his winter work habits." 
</P>
<P>
In rebuilding from their 207 losses of the last two years, the Orioles will 
take 53 players to training camp and revert to being Baby Birds. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38 on the roster, 26 have less than two years of professional 
experience, 16 weren't in the organization a year ago and 24 weren't with the 
organization two years ago. Only three have spent two seasons or more with the 
varsity -- Cal Ripken Jr., Larry Sheets and Dave Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston's refusal to sign a multiyear contract with the Seattle Mariners 
in favor of a one-year contract for $1.3 million means one of two things seems 
certain to happen. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners will have to accept trade packages from either the New York Mets 
or San Diego Padres or get nothing in return when Langston leaves as a free 
agent after the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners recently lost their best right-handed pitcher, Mike Moore, as a 
free agent, and left-hander Langston has left little doubt that he will be 
next. 
</P>
<P>
In his five seasons with a club that is 87 games under .500 for that span, 
Langston is five games over. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners were handed yet another defeat the other day but probably didn't 
deserve it. Arbitrator Stephen Goldberg ruled in favor of designated hitter 
Steve Balboni, increasing his salary from $350,000 to $800,000 on the basis of 
23 home runs, 66 RBIs and a .235 average. The Mariners had filed at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tal Smith, who represented the club, called it "the worst, the most outrageous, 
the most unsupportable decision in all my experience. I'm more than upset. I'm 
shocked and angered." 
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that the Mariners will release Balboni before the season 
starts, meaning they would be responsible for only a sixth of the $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, meanwhile, also favored the player -- Glenn Davis of the Houston 
Astros -- in the only other arbitration case he has heard this winter. Next on 
his docket: Orel Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
The Milwaukee Brewers medical staff believes that Ted Higuera, who had back 
surgery Jan. 20 for removal of a herniated disk, may be ready to pitch when the 
season starts rather than two to three weeks later, as first thought. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers' main hope is to have him 100% for the second half. Higuera's has a 
career record of 69-38 including a 40-14 mark after the All-Star break.

PROPOSAL TO JUDGE ICE SKATING JUDGES IS ANNOUNCED AFTER CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a sport as subjective as figure skating, whose officials usually take it 
for granted that there will be disagreements over the judging, the reaction to 
the controversy over the scores in the pairs freestyle program Friday night at 
the U.S. championships was exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Graham, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn., called a news 
conference Saturday to announce a proposal that would establish a technical 
committee to review the performance of the sport's judges. 
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal has been under consideration for some time, but he 
acknowledged that the timing of the announcement was appropriate considering 
the previous evening's questionable judging. 
</P>
<P>
"Our judges have not had very much accountability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which will be presented to the USFSA board of directors in May, 
does little to correct the damage done to Katy Keeley and Joseph Mero. The 
pairs team from Costa Mesa was deprived of a berth in the world championships 
next month at Paris by finishing third in the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
Only the first two teams, champions Kristi Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif., and 
Rudi Galindo of San Jose and runners-up Natalie and Wayne Seybold of Marion, 
Ind., will represent the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The problem Friday night was not that Keeley and Mero were scored too low but 
that the Seybolds were scored too high. 
</P>
<P>
The Seybolds, 1988 Olympians, were in first place entering the freestyle 
competition, but they experienced difficulties almost from the outset of their 
4 1/2-minute program. Natalie fell twice and twice turned double jumps into 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
After the second fall, a little more than 3 minutes into the program, the 
Seybolds interrupted their routine and approached the referee to ask for a 
chance to repair equipment. Natalie complained about a loose lace on her right 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
She later said that the lace loosened early in the program, blaming that for 
the team's miscues. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the referee rejected that argument. USFSA official Chuck Foster 
said that the referee, who was not available for comment, ruled that the loose 
lace did not impede the performance. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the rules, the Seybolds were allowed to repair the equipment 
before resuming their program. "I thought we had a disaster on our hands," said 
Ron Ludington, who coaches the Seybolds at Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
The judges disagreed. The Seybolds finished second in the freestyle program to 
Yamaguchi and Galindo. Two judges gave the Seybolds 5.8s on a scale of 6.0 for 
their presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm completely baffled," said John Nicks, who coaches Keeley and Mero at Costa 
Mesa. "After 24 years in the sport, I'm learning something new every year." 
</P>
<P>
What did he learn this year? 
</P>
<P>
"Never in any way to think my evaluation of a performance will be corroborated 
by our judging friends," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said the USFSA judging committee agreed with Nicks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure all the judges on the panel had their own reasons," he said. "But 
there were significant questions raised by the judging committee. The judging 
committee had the Seybolds ranked lower than the panel." 
</P>
<P>
No judges were available for comment because the USFSA Code of Ethics prohibits 
them from discussing competitions that they have scored. 
</P>
<P>
Although no appeals process is available to protest the judges' scores, Keeley 
and Mero could have been selected to represent the United States at Paris by 
the USFSA's international committee. 
</P>
<P>
But after a 30-minute meeting that was described by two persons who attended it 
as contentious, the international committee voted, 13-10, to send the first two 
teams to the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Keeley and Mero have not been favorites of the judges in recent years. In three 
of the last four national championships, there has been a perception by neutral 
observers that the Costa Mesa team has been judged unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked last year, but not this year," Keeley said. "These things 
happen, but you don't have to be happy with it."

STERN SAYS RELATIONSHIP WITH STERLING 'INTERESTING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his five years as commissioner of the National Basketball Assn., David Stern 
has probably dealt with Donald T. Sterling of the Clippers more than any other 
owner, although their time together does not appear to have bred mutual 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, Sterling's recollection of the Clippers' season-opening 
party at his Beverly Hills home in November, which Stern attended while on a 
West Coast swing that also included presenting the Lakers their championship 
rings and attending the first game at Sacramento's new Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"(Stern) likes the celebrities, he likes the music people, he likes the movie 
stars," Sterling said in December. "He liked the sponsors and he loved the 
media. So it was a wonderful day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a wonderful day that when it was over, he called his wife and 
said, 'You've got to come over. It's fun. It's not like Miami and it's not like 
Philadelphia and it's not like Sacramento.' " 
</P>
<P>
True story? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Stern replies without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
Then he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he says again. "He's the best. Oh, gosh, Donald." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time Stern has had to contradict a potentially 
embarrassing statement by Sterling, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a fascinating person who is absolutely determined to make the 
Clippers a success in Los Angeles," Stern said of Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
But how do Sterling's comments affect his role? 
</P>
<P>
Stern paused. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes it interesting," the commissioner said. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

GUNNER ON THE LOOSE; 
</P>
<P>
LOYOLA'S JEFF FRYER HAS THE OK TO SHOOT ANYTIME, ANYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In many ways, Jeff Fryer is the stereotypical beach boy: blond, tanned, 
cheerfully laid back. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Loyola Marymount guard takes the basketball floor. Then his jaw takes 
on a businesslike set and his blue eyes get an icy glaze, like a gunfighter of 
old squinting into the sun. 
</P>
<P>
These are the eyes of a shooter. The eyes of a killer. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hired gunner," said Loyola Coach Paul Westhead. "He knows that. He fits 
the crucial 2-man (off guard) position in our system -- shooting any time you 
get your hands on it. We knew he could shoot coming out of high school. We 
didn't know how tough or hard-working he was." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer's game has so exceeded expectations that his card may someday read, "Have 
gun, will travel." That makes the scrappy 6-foot-2 junior work even harder. 
</P>
<P>
"My high school coach always told me I'd never reach my peak, that I had 
unlimited potential," Fryer recalled earlier this week. "I listened to that, 
and worked, and it's paid off. I have a shooting coach who's really pushing me 
-- he says I have a future because of my outside shot. There's always a place 
for shooters. I just have to continue to be driven." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer's shooting has driven some opponents to distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a 29-point performance last weekend against the University of San 
Diego in which he hit 11 of 14 shots, including four of six three-pointers, 
Fryer was averaging 23.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.9 three-pointers per game, 
and shooting 84% from the foul line. He is averaging more than 33 minutes per 
game, an impressive stat in Loyola's grueling system, and he has joined a 
handful of past and present Loyola players in scoring 500 points in a season. 
</P>
<P>
His performances include a nationally televised 42-point game against DePaul in 
which he canned nine of 14 three-point shots, 37 points in the following game 
against West Coast Athletic Conference foe Gonzaga and two other 30-point 
games. In his last game as a sophomore, in the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament last March against North Carolina, he hit eight three-pointers and 
scored 27 points in 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
If left open, Fryer is deadly. He often shoots from beyond the pro three-point 
line, legitimate 25-footers. At DePaul he hit several three-pointers in a row 
from so far out that when he went by the DePaul bench, Blue Demons Coach Joey 
Meyer jokingly told him, "Open your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
However, Fryer's shooting comes with a price. Because he shoots so fast and 
from so far, and because defenses now gear up for him, Fryer is shooting only 
40% for the season, 36% from three-point range. He has had a couple of off 
nights, highlighted by a two-for-23 game against Portland. Some who follow the 
team, including Fryer's personal shooting tutor, say a shooter of his caliber 
should have a better percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Fryer would like to, but both he and Westhead take little notice of the 
percentages. In Loyola's offense, they say, Fryer's job is to shoot and score. 
And he does. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead said Fryer's percentage "doesn't bother me at all. If I've had any 
harsh words for him over the three years, it's to shoot more. Sometimes I sense 
he's hesitating. I never would question his shots." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer said the percentage "doesn't concern me at all. . . . It doesn't matter 
to me. I'm gonna keep shooting. I think I'm playing real well right now, except 
for a few games I've lost my concentration. That has caused my percentage to go 
down. Otherwise I'd be shooting in the upper 40s. I can't allow myself (to let 
concentration lapse) anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Marumoto is a Newport Beach pharmacist who took an interest in the 
biomechanics of shooting and tutors a handful of players, including Fryer. "He 
should work on his percentage," Marumoto said. "He should be shooting 46%. Jeff 
has a lot of natural talent. If he works hard, he has some pro prospects. He 
really has to work hard in the off-season. I think this summer he'll make the 
commitment. I'd like to see him hit 48%. This summer he'll shoot 400 to 600 
shots a day." 
</P>
<P>
In games, however, it's a different proposition. And with junior Bo Kimble out 
of the lineup with an injury for much of the season, opponents have been 
waiting for Fryer in his accustomed shooting spot in the right corner. To 
counter, Fryer has had to drive more and shoot on the run, and sometimes force 
shots in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"This year almost every team is really gearing up for him," Westhead said. 
"He'll be 30 feet away from the basket, and there'll be somebody face-guarding 
him. They're sending a lot of people at him. He's experiencing the results of 
his reputation. That has caused him to put the ball on the floor more and shoot 
off the dribble, which is not necessarily what he does best. All that affects 
his percentage. His degree of difficulty has gone up. Surprisingly, so has his 
scoring average. It's really a compliment to him." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer said, "In the off season I worked on my driving more -- I knew teams and 
players would force me to. I think I've improved a lot in that. I've started to 
go to the boards a lot more. I've just become a lot more aggressive; I've 
matured as a player. A lot of teams are waiting for me (in the right corner) 
because they know what I do. We have plays to counter that, when they jump me 
like that. Coach has told me sometimes to let it happen; my points will come. 
So I just kinda have that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer came out of Corona del Mar High as Orange County's leading prep scorer. 
He averaged 28.6 points per game as a senior -- before the high schools 
instituted the three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Steve, an Orange County businessman who attends virtually every 
game, wanted his son to go to nearby UC Irvine. So far, Fryer's decision has 
been the right one. He has progressed from a spot starter as a freshman to one 
of the key shooters as a sophomore to a featured scorer this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the perfect place for me," Fryer said. "There's no limits on my 
shooting, just like high school. I always felt Coach Westhead had a lot of 
faith in me. I knew he liked the way I played because I work real hard. He 
really likes that." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer was Westhead's first true recruit at Loyola, and the coach recalls that 
Fryer seemed to have a grasp on Loyola's future. "The thing I remember most was 
he asked me if the NCAA would have the three-point shot," Westhead said. "I 
said no way. Then out of the blue, they added the (three-point) rule the next 
week. It's like he was psychic. I called him and said, 'Your stock just went 
up.' He had terrific range as a shooter in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Fryer averaged 8.3 points as a freshman, missing the end of the season with a 
stress fracture in his leg. Last year, starting 15 of 32 games, he increased 
his scoring average to 12.6 points and led the team in three-pointers with 86. 
</P>
<P>
But from the start, the aspect Westhead liked was Fryer's constant hustle, that 
determined look in his eyes. Belying Loyola's reputation for ignoring defense, 
Fryer tenaciously hounds his man, chases the ball and dives on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to be relentless on defense and never get lazy," he said. "You get real 
tired. It's easy to just say, 'This time I'm gonna rest on defense.' Every 
time, you have to push through and say, 'I have a little more energy.' You find 
you do." 
</P>
<P>
Westhead recalled a game last year at San Francisco where Fryer blocked out a 
larger player trying to rebound and was so energetic about it that he 
practically backed the bigger man into the stands. "He just railroaded this 6-9 
guy out of the gym. Nobody could believe it," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kind of jumped in and started working hard as a freshman. He has never 
stopped working. He's a tireless guy, especially on defense. That's not usually 
the style of a shooter. He really engages in it. He goes harder every day; he 
goes till his legs give out." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer he was cut in tryouts for a team in a pro-am league. So he played 
in an Orange County league, where he averaged 25 points per game. He said he 
used his lack of respect as motivation. He continues to surprise people. 
</P>
<P>
"I've kinda surpassed my expectations, especially this year, and the way we won 
(the conference title) last year," he admitted. "I don't have the greatest 
jumping ability or speed, but I've got my shot. I still don't think I've 
reached my peak yet."

EL SEGUNDO CENTER SHAWN FOSTER PLAYS TALLER, FASTER THAN FOES EXPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY GONZALEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shawn Foster's parents, Dan and Olivia, sat in the stands at Salesian High 
School on Feb. 3, waiting for the second half of the game with El Segundo to 
begin. They had traveled more than an hour in the rain to watch their son, El 
Segundo's star center. 
</P>
<P>
"Watch this. This is a good play," Dan Foster said just as the Eagles broke 
their huddle and took the ball out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rick Sabosky called "Ice," an in-bounds play that sets up a jump shot for 
Eagles guard Scott Panfil. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was passed in. Panfil skirted around a pick by two teammates and 
launched the ball toward the basket from about 25 feet. Though Panfil is a good 
shooter, this jumper strayed high and to the right. But it wasn't a shot, it 
was an alley-oop pass. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Shawn Foster jumped from the right of the key, grabbed the ball above 
the basket and slam-dunked it. The gym was stunned into silence. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive alley-oop was nothing new to Foster's parents or other El 
Segundo fans, but to the uninitiated, Foster is surprisingly quick for his size 
and plays much taller than his 6-4 height. 
</P>
<P>
Foster has led his team to a 13-10 overall record, 9-3 in the Santa Fe League. 
The Eagles lost to Cathedral on Wednesday night, ruining their chances for a 
league title, but they are headed to the CIF Southern Section 2-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Foster wears glasses off the court but sees very well without them when he 
plays. He is averaging 29 points, seven rebounds and six assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is listed as a center, Foster plays everywhere from point man on the 
full-court press to post man on offense. He often receives an outlet pass and 
leads the fast break, handling the ball like a guard. He also jumps out of 
nowhere to block shots. He swatted one shot against Cathedral three rows deep 
into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't think he'd get that high, being only 6-4," said Jerry Melendrez, 
a senior on the Salesian team. "But then, you wouldn't think he'd be that quick 
for such a big guy." 
</P>
<P>
"No one has shut him down this year," said Sabosky. Foster scored 36 points 
against Loyola, a top-10 5-AA Division team, and 27 against Inglewood and its 
star player, Harold Miner. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to get 20 points no matter what you do," said Cathedral Coach 
Michael Miller. Foster says his best performance may have been in his freshman 
year when El Segundo played Brea-Olinda, led by Kevin Walker, now a junior 
center at UCLA. Foster watched Walker score 22 points in the first half, was 
assigned to guard him in the second half and held him to only two more points, 
blocking two shots. 
</P>
<P>
Foster has troubled opponents for four years in five sports. His size and speed 
allow him to do just about anything he wants to athletically. Foster said he 
could dunk as a seventh-grader, though his father says that didn't happen until 
eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Besides basketball, Foster has lettered in water polo, football and track. He 
also pitched for the junior varsity baseball team as a sophomore but threw his 
arm out and later gave up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
Though he had fun playing other sports, Foster's passion is basketball. In 
fact, some say he can become too passionate about it. At times, he has been 
labeled immature, volatile, and an "attitude problem." 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through some rough times," said Sabosky. "(Foster) has had some 
problems in how he handled himself. It's almost like he would take it 
personally if he got fouled; he would want to start a fight or something." 
</P>
<P>
Foster said some of his problems arose from his personal friendship with 
Sabosky. Because Sabosky and Foster's father had played together in industrial 
leagues together, Foster would take advantage of the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
He also had problems with some of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some big mouths on the team, and I sort of followed them, other guys I 
didn't get along with," Foster said. "We had some guys who would say, 'You 
scored enough last game; it's my turn to score.' " 
</P>
<P>
But now, Foster, Sabosky and his parents all agree, his rebel stage is over. 
Foster is co-captain of the Eagles. He doesn't want to fight; he just wants to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
His remaining weaknesses, he says, are rebounding and free-throw shooting. His 
strong point is the kind of desire he showed last week against Salesian. 
</P>
<P>
"Shawn can dominate a game when he wants to," said Dan Foster. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter he did just that, scoring 13 of El Segundo's 29 points. He 
broke away for two dunks, stole two passes and dished off three assists, two to 
fellow post man Ken Talanoa. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooling off" after that, Foster finished with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 11 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
For the first game this season, he didn't lead the Eagles in scoring. 
Sharpshooter Panfil did with 32 points, which suited Foster fine. 
</P>
<P>
For a prolific scorer, he has also done "an excellent job in giving the ball 
up" this season, Sabosky noted. 
</P>
<P>
After the playoffs, Foster will join an off-season league and choose a college. 
He said his grades are not up to Division I level yet, but he is willing to 
play at a community college for two years, perhaps El Camino, and then transfer 
to a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to play for UNLV," said Foster. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian hasn't called yet, but Foster might grow some (his 
father is 6-6), he has two years to work on his grades and he promises that the 
only kind of rebel he'll be is a Runnin' Rebel.

HARD WORK GIVES WESTLAKE ITS DUE; 
</P>
<P>
WARRIORS DOMINATE MARMONTE LEAGUE WRESTLING TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone believes in the good old American work ethic, it certainly has to be 
Coach Larry Stonebraker and his Westlake High wrestling team. 
</P>
<P>
A year of lifting weights, conditioning and just plain hard work paid off 
Saturday night. Westlake put on the blue collar and collared the Marmonte 
League wrestling championship with 189.5 points at Camarillo High. The Warriors 
(16-2 in dual meets) already had captured the league dual-meet title. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, league co-champion with Channel Islands last year, finished 
second with 123.5 points and Simi Valley took third with 122.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We were good last year, but we worked hard and just scored more points this 
year," Stonebraker said. "The guys worked a lot in the off-season in weight 
training and summer wrestling camps. It became a year-round job for them." 
</P>
<P>
Eight Westlake wrestlers in 13 weight classifications advanced to the 
championship round and six took titles. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' first championship came in the 112-pound match as Farzin 
Daneshnia upset last year's league champion, Chris Corpuz of Channel Islands, 
by pinning him with 47 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I really improved because of a wrestling camp I attended in Iowa last summer," 
Daneshnia said. "We had a big rivalry between us. He beat me in the league 
finals last year, but I knew I could pull it out if I would concentrate, and I 
got the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake registered four more pins, including one in 39 seconds by Billy Hunter 
(175 pounds) over Don Moore of Channel Islands. Hunter improved his record to 
30-0 and is ranked third in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked hard and we had a lot of experience this year," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Also for Westlake, Brad Miya (119 pounds) pinned Camarillo's Jim James in 1:32, 
Neil Mason (145) pinned Camarillo's Mike Schioppi in 1:38, and Dave Schumm 
(191) pinned Dave Miller of Thousand Oaks in 3:43. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' other championship went to Darrell Valance (165), who won a tough 
5-2 overtime decision over Thousand Oaks' Sean Toner. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park's Chris Kilbane, defending league and Southern Section 4-A 
Division champion, won the 154-pound class with a 15-0 superior decision over 
Charlie Verhoven of Simi Valley. Also for Newbury Park, Kevin Mabry won at 105 
pounds and Jeff Jay took the heavyweight class. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestlers finishing first or second qualified for the Southern Section 4-A meet 
next Friday and Saturday at Edison High. Third-place finishers are alternates.

REVAMPED LINEUP BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO NORTHRIDGE'S OFFENSE IN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having sputtered in several important games recently, Cal State Northridge 
injected an untested but obviously high-octane mixture into its starting lineup 
Saturday against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The new face belonged to Sandy Brown. After The 6-5 forward helped Northridge 
get off to a fast start, the Matadors had far too much horsepower for the 
Mustangs in a 90-61 victory in in a California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game 
at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a freshman from Manual Arts High, scored 12 points in his first college 
start and helped limit Coby Naess, San Luis Obispo's top scorer, to four points 
-- 14 under his season average. 
</P>
<P>
Brown helped put CSUN on the right track early. After seven minutes, he had 
outscored the Mustangs by himself, 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
"The last couple of games we got off flat," Brown said. "After I made the first 
one on an offensive rebound I felt I could help keep us running." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Brown, who had been CSUN's second or third man off the bench, 
represented half of a major change in the Matadors' starting lineup. Karl 
Becker, a part-time starter this season, also joined the opening lineup. 
</P>
<P>
On the bench at the start were Derrick Gathers and Darren Matsubara, 
Northridge's top scorers in CCAA games. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers was being disciplined for his failure to notify Coach Pete Cassidy that 
he would be late for practice on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And Matsubara? 
</P>
<P>
"It was a coach's decision," Matsubara said. "Maybe we should do it all the 
time. It worked well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara led Northridge with 17 points in 23 minutes. But there were plenty of 
standouts for CSUN. Alan Fraser, Kris Brodowski and Kendell McDaniels dominated 
play inside the key. 
</P>
<P>
"Alan Fraser is the most underrated player in the conference in my opinion," 
Cassidy said of the 6-6 senior who scored 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Brodowski and McDaniels turned in equally strong blue-collar efforts. Brodowski 
scored only six points, but added nine rebounds and five assists. McDaniels had 
eight points and four rebounds in only 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (14-9) shot 49% and never relented on defense, forcing 17 turnovers. 
San Luis Obispo (13-9), one of the conference's better shooting teams, made 21 
of 68 (30.9%) of its field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the second or third time this year we've played in coach's system -- 
really stayed in it the whole way," Matsubara said. "He set down the guidelines 
and we stuck with them. It's a lot easier when everyone is doing the same 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cassidy: "I didn't say anything to them that I haven't been saying all 
year long . . . but tonight it clicked. It's pretty basketball when you play 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
But it helped turn the CCAA standings into one ugly mess. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, 5-5 in conference play, moved into a tie for fourth with San Luis 
Obispo and Chapman. Four teams make the conference's postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors play at Chapman on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN led at the half, 42-29, and only a three-point shooting exhibition by 
James Gama kept the Mustangs temporarily within distance in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Gama, a former Santa Clara standout who finished with 20 points, scored nine of 
San Luis Obispo's first 10 points in the half on three long-range shots. They 
were the only field goals made by the Mustangs until Errol Talley scored on a 
layup with 11:21 left.

SANCTIONS AGAINST THE SOVIETS MAY BE THE HOTTEST POTATO ON BUSH'S PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. TOTH and ART PINE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the last Soviet troops leave Afghanistan, the Bush Administration is coming 
under increasing pressure to lift the sanctions the United States imposed 
nearly a decade ago on Western exports of militarily valuable technology to the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on whether to relax the sanctions put in place after the Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan is "the hottest foreign policy issue facing the new 
Administration," a State Department official said last week. It will provide 
the first sign of how President Bush will act on a broad range of controversial 
issues, including trade and economic credits that might be offered to Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Western European nations, which have been chafing under the technology export 
restrictions for eight years, argue that removing them may encourage Gorbachev 
to pull back from other foreign adventures as well as to continue his efforts 
to reform his country's political and economic systems. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, business leaders, both in the United States and Western 
Europe, want to expand their trade with the Soviet Union. American 
manufacturers anxiously watch their West European competitors rushing to 
Moscow, financed by billions of dollars of credit lines that U.S. banks will 
not match. 
</P>
<P>
The issue divided the Reagan Administration in its closing days. The Pentagon 
opposed any easing of technology controls while the State Department favored 
it. The split seems likely to continue in the Bush Administration as the new 
secretary of state, James A. Baker III, begins a whirlwind tour of Europe this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The question goes well beyond the narrow matter of strategically sensitive 
technology, however. "It's much more political than economic," an official 
said, because of related issues that are backed up behind it. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Should Washington also give Moscow the full array of trade and credit 
privileges that it confers on other Communist bloc nations, such as China? This 
issue has been linked to Soviet curbs on Jewish emigration, with Jewish groups 
in the United States now reassessing their opposition to relaxed trade 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
* Should the United States allow the Soviets to join international economic 
organizations such as the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank? 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is already causing a flurry in Congress, where conservatives -- 
suspicious of any warming of U.S.-Soviet relations and aware of how the Soviets 
took economic advantage of detente 15 years ago -- are considering new 
legislation to impede the growing rapport between the superpowers. Some 
senators are also exploring whether those trade restrictions aimed at achieving 
freer emigration from the Soviet Union can now be tied to other human-rights 
issues instead. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest challenge to the new Administration," according to Don Bonker, a 
former Democratic congressman from Washington and a specialist on international 
economic policy and trade, "is to develop a Western consensus on how to handle 
economic and political relations with Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
The technology issue is particularly sensitive. A task force of senior 
officials from various agencies, including the State and Defense departments, 
had scheduled a meeting last week to discuss options. However, the session -- 
ordered initially by the National Security Council -- was canceled abruptly 
only a few minutes before it was to have begun, apparently because the White 
House feared that it might reduce the Administration's flexibility in advance 
of Baker's trip to North Atlantic Treaty Organization capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing issue is whether the United States should lift its virtual 
ban on the sales of high-technology items to the East. Washington exercises 
this almost unilaterally as part of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls, the 16-country organization set up to regulate strategic 
exports from the West. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of CoCom, as the organization is known informally, militarily 
sensitive technology is sorted into three major categories. More sophisticated 
items -- particularly those with military applications -- require unanimous 
approval of all members before any of the 16 can legally export them to 
Communist bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 
Washington served notice that it would veto with "no exceptions" all 
applications for permission to export highest-category technology to the Soviet 
Union. It has stuck tenaciously to that stand. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when Moscow was about halfway through its withdrawal of troops 
from Afghanistan, NATO nations, led by Britain, petitioned the United States to 
relax its "no-exceptions" policy. In interagency debates, the Pentagon argued 
that the continued restriction was justified on national security grounds 
whether or not the Soviets got out of Afghanistan by the Feb. 15 withdrawal 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
However, the State Department called for lifting the limitation, contending 
that it was imposed initially for foreign policy reasons -- as a punishment for 
Soviet actions -- and not for national security considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, State argued, it ought to be withdrawn once the Soviet occupation ended. 
National security was not at stake, it said, since Communist bloc nations such 
as Poland, whose intelligence and military services are closely tied to those 
of the Soviets, were not covered by the "no-exceptions" restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The "no-exceptions" controversy could become a divisive issue in the alliance. 
West European states have long bridled under U.S.-imposed technology controls, 
particularly in the "extra-territorial" reach -- beyond U.S. borders -- that 
the United States exercises by vetoing sales of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
And the Europeans, noting pointedly that Washington has allowed China to buy 
high-level technology without impediment, complain of a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
No decision is expected by the Administration for at least a few weeks, until 
Baker returns and the review is completed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The spate of Western credits to Moscow over the past eight months, amounting to 
more than $7 billion, is the next most-urgent economic issue facing the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
An alarmed Congress declared, in the trade act passed last year, that the 
United States must not be tougher on its own business people, including banks, 
than foreign governments are on their own. That sentiment could be converted 
into specific laws next year as Congress reviews the Export Administration Act. 
</P>
<P>
Bonker told business executives at a meeting here recently that one proposal 
would try to ensure that the Soviets do not use Western commercial bank credits 
to finance the purchase of equipment deemed strategically important. Another 
proposed measure would insist that West European firms, whose governments are 
less rigorous in policing export rules, be held more accountable for violating 
any alliancewide rules in offering credit to the Soviets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is also sentiment in Congress for repeal of two amendments that 
severely limit credit to Moscow from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. One puts a 
ceiling of $40 million on any Soviet project, while the so-called Stevenson 
Amendment sets an overall limit of $300 million on Soviet borrowing. But since 
the bank may not receive additional funds this year due to U.S. budget 
constraints, such moves may have little impact. 
</P>
<P>
Both of the credit limits are tied to Soviet immigration policies, as is the 
best known restriction on trade, the so-called Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974. 
It forbids the granting of most-favored-nation trading status -- which would 
eliminate special tariffs on goods -- to the Soviet Union until Moscow permits 
substantially more emigration. 
</P>
<P>
The late Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) indicated that a level of 60,000 Jewish 
emigrants per year would allow most-favored-nation status for Moscow. The level 
reached 51,000 in 1979, and various U.S. Jewish groups have since admitted 
privately that they should have encouraged its continuation by calling for a 
waiver on the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The emigration rate dropped precipitously to less than 1,000 in 1986 before 
beginning a steep climb, to more than 19,000 last year. The emigration of as 
many as 40,000 Soviet Jews is anticipated in 1989, and Jewish groups are 
signaling their willingness to support liberalizing steps. Even the amendment's 
co-author, former Rep. Charles A. Vanik (D-Ohio), has recommended relaxation in 
a letter to the Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
Vanik urged a waiver of the amendment for 18 months if emigration continues 
high. At least one Jewish group endorsed that path, while most others are 
reassessing their stands. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two groups dealing specifically with the issue, a spokesman for the 
National Conference on Soviet Jewry said the group is "looking toward a new 
policy in the near future." The Union of Councils on Soviet Jewry, which is 
less inclined to support a relaxation, has called for repeal of the Stevenson 
Amendment only if emigration levels remain high. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration's policy, which is likely to be continued by Bush, is 
to "favor expansion of mutually beneficial (i.e., non-subsidized) non-strategic 
trade with the Soviet Union," an official said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Administration sees trade as a largely domestic political issue. 
Rather than the government taking the lead, the official added, consensus must 
develop within the U.S. electorate before the present restrictions can be 
changed. Change is unlikely to occur this year, he said, but it could come 
before a wide-ranging East-West economic conference, proposed by the Soviets 
and grudgingly agreed to recently by the United States, is held in the spring 
of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Soviets have shown interest in joining international economic 
organizations such as GATT, the IMF and the World Bank. Their initial overture 
to GATT was summarily rejected by the United States in 1986, ostensibly on 
grounds that the Soviets' non-market Communist economy was incompatible with 
the aims and practices of the Western capitalist trading world. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet economic statistics are inadequate, its currency is not convertible to 
Western currencies, and its prices are so thoroughly subsidized that the true 
cost of goods is unknown. On the other hand, other countries with non-market 
economies -- Poland, Hungary and Romania, for example -- are GATT members, and, 
with U.S. encouragement, China has been granted observer status -- the first 
step toward full membership. 
</P>
<P>
Washington remains opposed to a proposal that the Soviet Union be granted 
observer status in GATT because of fear that Moscow would use it for short-term 
propaganda and political advantage. However, Western European nations are 
increasingly sympathetic to this course, U.S. officials admit, particularly as 
Gorbachev continues his effort to change the Soviet image abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, U.S. officials caution that even if Washington decides to relax its 
restrictions, any changes are likely to be gradual -- "more symbolic than 
actual" -- at least for a few more years. Western analysts say the Soviet 
economy is so backward now that the Kremlin is likely to have difficulty 
bringing it into the 20th Century -- let alone the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
Still, senior U.S. policy-makers concede that the issue is one they must 
address, if only to maintain American credibility on the strategic technology 
issue among U.S. allies. "If we seem unreasonable on this, we will lose our 
ability to lead," one strategist here said. "We're going to have to be flexible 
in spirit, if not also in fact."

'BUYING AMERICAN' BECOMES INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AS CAR MAKERS GLOBALIZE 
OPERATIONS 
</P>

<P>

DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just a small news item, but it spoke volumes about the state of the 
world's automotive industry. Peugeot, the item revealed earlier this month, has 
formed a joint venture with an industrial company in India to produce 
French-designed pickup trucks near Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
Peugeot's announcement came the same week that Chrysler unveiled a 
double-barreled plan not only to link up with Renault of France, but Hyundai of 
South Korea as well. Chrysler said it will jointly produce mini-utility 
vehicles with Renault in both Europe and the United States, while Hyundai will 
build mid-size cars for Chrysler in Hyundai's new plant in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Just the week before that, Toyota of Japan announced that it is seriously 
considering building passenger cars in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The globalization of the auto industry -- heralded for more than a decade by 
analysts and industry executives alike -- has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Look no further than your local Pontiac dealership, where cars are now just as 
likely to come from Seoul as from Detroit. Consider the Pontiac Le Mans, one of 
GM's smallest cars. Designed in West Germany, it is assembled in South Korea 
with parts from around the world and finally is sold by Pontiac in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some cars today are import and domestic at the same time; Cadillac for 
instance, builds its Allante bodies in Turin, Italy and flies them each day to 
the United States to be attached to their chassis on a final assembly line in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make people wonder what meaning is left in the phrase "Buy 
American." 
</P>
<P>
Today, a dizzying array of joint ventures and other production projects spread 
out around the planet is rapidly blurring the lines of demarcation between the 
major Asian, American and European auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Trade barriers have done little to stop the trend. If anything, they may have 
accelerated it as the Japanese and Koreans have scrambled to set up local 
production operations and form joint ventures around the world to skirt import 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the Japanese quickly established assembly operations in the 
United States and Canada and by next fall will have eight plants up and running 
in this country; now they are moving fast to do the same in Europe to avoid 
tough new trade rules when the European Community becomes a true Common Market 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere are the results of this internationalization more evident than in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with the industrial giants of Detroit, Tokyo, Paris and Turin working 
ever closer on new products aimed at the huge American market, it is becoming 
increasingly difficult for American consumers to tell import from domestic. As 
a result, old loyalties to American-built products seem to be breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
"Those distinctions are becoming more blurred," observes Bill Lehman, founder 
of Opinion Survey Center, a Maumee, Ohio-based market research firm. "People 
are becoming more open-minded about buying either domestic or import than they 
were five or 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Adds a Ford official: "We find that customers don't know and don't even care 
where a car is built anymore. As long as it has one of the major auto makers' 
names on it, there are not that many questions being asked out there in the 
dealerships about where a car comes from." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increasing Homogeneity 
</P>
<P>
In fact, American, Japanese and European cars are now often designed in the 
same styling studios and built in the same plants, and there is growing concern 
that this sharing of resources and manufacturing prowess is leading to a new 
sameness in the way cars on the road look and feel. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there is a wider array of product offerings than ever before, 
thanks to increased competition in the American market. Yet among cars 
competing head to head within the same size and weight classifications, there 
still seems to be an increasing level of homogeneity of technology, quality and 
design. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a convergence in car design, especially in the really competitive 
compact market, where there is going to be an even greater blurring in the 
future," says John O'Donnell, an analyst with the international automotive 
project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "All you've got to do is 
drive around and see that everybody is converging on the Ford Aero look." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the major Japanese, American and European automotive parts 
suppliers have also begun to interlock. They have built plants in other nations 
and formed joint ventures among themselves to gain quick access to markets as 
they follow their customers -- the major auto makers -- around the world. 
Hundreds of Japanese parts suppliers, for instance, have opened plants in the 
United States to serve the new Japanese assembly plants and are working for the 
Big Three as well. 
</P>
<P>
With their critical supply bases so intertwined, it's no wonder that the major 
auto makers all have access to virtually the same base of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"The international connections have become so extensive that there is a merging 
of technologies around the world," observes David Cole, director of the Center 
for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. "It's 
almost like we are all a part of the same database." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'One-Shot Events' 
</P>
<P>
Now, new technology developed in Tokyo or Paris often finds its way almost 
immediately to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"What all of this is doing is speeding the availability of technology to the 
car and truck buyer," says Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald. "What joint 
ventures are all about is two companies coming together to do technology they 
couldn't quite get to on their own. That's certainly the case with our new JJ 
(mini-utility vehicle) project with Renault." 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts and auto executives disagree, however, that the spread of so many 
interlocking ventures has really led to a high level of cooperation between the 
Japanese and American auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that the joint ventures are little more than temporary supply 
arrangements and that the companies involved work hard to try to limit the 
amount of confidential information they exchange with their foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see these joint ventures as anything but extremely opportunistic 
relationships," says Maryanne Keller, automotive analyst with Furman, Selz, 
Mager, Dietz &amp; Birney, a New York investment firm. "These ventures are for 
the most part one-shot events. These companies are in fact competitors, major 
competitors, and that is a point that cannot be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there seems little doubt that these partnerships are on the verge of 
forcing a dramatic change in the way this nation perceives the car industry. 
Most notably, the new global networking is quickly turning slogans such as "Buy 
American" and government policies like restrictions on Japanese imports -- into 
anachronisms. 
</P>
<P>
With their expanding American manufacturing operations, the Japanese are 
selling more cars here than ever before -- at a time their direct imports from 
Japan are actually declining. It is no coincidence that the major Japanese auto 
makers have generally stopped complaining about the continuation of import 
quotas on cars shipped to the United States directly from Japan. It's because 
the rules have become irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"The restraints have lost meaning, they are dead," says Cole. "I think that the 
Japanese government just wants to keep them around to provide some discipline 
among the Japanese manufacturers and to avoid increased pressure for 
protectionism here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scouring Japan, Europe 
</P>
<P>
And, while Detroit executives still insist on continued trade protection for 
the domestic industry, their firms have become some of the most international 
of any of the world's auto conglomerates. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are selling cars in North 
America that are assembled in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Thailand, Taiwan, 
West Germany and Italy, as well as cars built by joint ventures with Japanese 
auto makers in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
While the domestics look to Asia for small cars, they scour Europe just as 
eagerly for luxury models. Chrysler, for instance, is counting on Maserati for 
a high-priced two-seat coupe and has already acquired Lamborghini outright. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even more so than either GM or Chrysler, Ford seems to be the company that 
is staking its future most completely on an increasingly complex global web of 
automotive partnerships. A quick glance at Ford's expanding relationships 
reveals the extent to which the world's auto industry is interwoven. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Ford has turned over much of its small car development to Mazda -- 
which is 25% owned by Ford. Mazda also builds Ford's hot new Probe in its new 
American plant; meanwhile, Ford has also formed a U.S. joint venture with 
Nissan to build a new van for the American market in an Ohio assembly plant. At 
the same time, Kia Motors of South Korea, which is 10% owned by Ford, now 
builds Ford's Festiva model, while Ford produces its Mazda-designed Mercury 
Tracer in a new plant in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Ford has also formed new partnerships that are strictly designed to function 
overseas. Ford has merged its auto operations in Brazil and Argentina into a 
joint venture with Volkswagen, has acquired 75% of Aston Martin of Britain and 
has begun a limited project with Nissan to share utility vehicles in Australia 
-- where Ford and Nissan have announced tentative plans to work together on car 
development as well. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ford may be on the verge of taking its biggest international step of all. 
Analysts say Ford is about to become the first auto maker to divide up all of 
its basic car development efforts among engineers in Japan, the United States 
and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, analysts say, Ford's small cars -- up to the size of its current 
Escort -- will all come from Mazda, its mid-size cars -- the replacements for 
its current Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz -- would be developed by Ford of 
Europe, and its large cars -- from its Taurus-Sable line on up -- would be 
developed in North America. 
</P>
<P>
What Ford's global strategy makes clear is that in more and more cases, there 
aren't any differences between American and foreign cars. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Probe, for instance, is built on the same Mazda assembly line in 
Michigan that produces Mazda's new MX6. The new Mitsubishi Eclipse, meanwhile, 
is built in the same Illinois plant that produces Chrysler's new Plymouth 
Laser. GM's Geo Prizm is built in the same GM-Toyota joint venture facility 
that is turning out the latest Toyota Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts acknowledge that the auto industry's international ties have made it 
increasingly difficult to determine winners and losers and to predict which 
companies will survive. 
</P>
<P>
But many agree that only a handful of proud companies, most notably Toyota and 
Honda, are likely to go it alone in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, some see rival families of paired Asian and American and European 
companies forming into giant combines to dominate the world's auto industry. 
The outlines of such families seem to be emerging in some of the joint ventures 
already under way: Ford and Mazda; Chrysler, Mitsubishi and Renault; GM and its 
Japanese partners, Isuzu and Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
"The production processes and the types of technologies that are emphasized in 
the world should become more similar among companies that are cooperating," 
notes one former top product planner at General Motors. "I think the 
technology, designs and processes will come together by groups. 
</P>
<P>
"And, eventually, I think you will see these international partnerships form 
their own giant spheres of influence."

JAMES FLANIGAN: OPPORTUNITY IS EVERYWHERE FOR SMART INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors, as usual, read the headlines differently last week. And that's why 
the stocks of strong, healthy savings and loan companies hit new highs after 
President Bush unveiled a program for dealing with the industry's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Investors saw the doughnut, not the hole. Though Bush's plan levied higher 
insurance charges on the savings and loan industry, the promise that sick 
S&amp;Ls would be weeded out meant brighter prospects for the healthy. And so 
the stocks of such firms as H. F. Ahmanson (Home Savings), CalFed, Golden West 
Financial and Great Western Financial all went up. 
</P>
<P>
Which confirmed the insight of two prominent mutual fund managers, Peter Lynch 
of Fidelity Magellan Fund and John Neff of Vanguard Windsor fund. Both hold 
S&amp;L stocks in their fund portfolios because, as they explained recently in 
Barron's financial weekly, they see a healthy mortgage industry despite 
problems at some S&amp;Ls. Mortgages are bigger, Lynch pointed out; the house 
that once was bought with an $18,000 mortgage sells today at a price requiring 
a $100,000 mortgage. As a result, business will grow for mortgage lenders, such 
as the S&amp;Ls whose stock prices rose last week. 
</P>
<P>
The point of that story is what it says not of S&amp;Ls but of investors like 
Lynch and Neff. Though they're very big investors -- Lynch with $11 billion 
invested in 1,300 stocks, Neff concentrating $5.6 billion in about 70 stocks -- 
their thinking is disarmingly simple and clear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of Opportunity 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the kind of thinking that any investor, amateur or professional, 
is capable of, Lynch maintains. And that's the message of his forthcoming book, 
"One Up on Wall Street": That the individual investor has a place in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunity, says Lynch, is all around you. Investors in Southern California 
could have seen long before professional Wall Streeters that Newhall Land &amp; 
Farming was sitting on valuable properties. Newhall, the Valencia-based 
developer, has been a stock market winner, rising from about $11 a share six 
years ago to $51 today. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, you can do well in mutual funds: Magellan has posted average annual 
gains of 18% over a long period. Neff's Windsor has a comparable long-term 
record and was up 27% last year. But what has helped the funds do well are 
their big gainers, such as Ford -- which was losing money and selling for $3.50 
a share in 1981 but is highly profitable and selling for about $56 today -- a 
16-fold rise in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Any investor could have made that winning investment in Ford, argues Lynch. It 
took no great sophistication to notice years ago that the company was producing 
more attractive cars. "This is not a complicated business," he says. "All it 
takes is simple logic and fourth-grade arithmetic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ignore Gloomy Forecasts 
</P>
<P>
Why is Lynch, who earns a reported $3 million a year at Fidelity, preaching to 
the masses? Because he worries that individual investors are confusing gambling 
with investing, playing options on General Motors -- in which they can be wiped 
out in short-term fluctuations of the stock when they should be buying GM 
shares and benefiting from long-term price appreciation and the growing 
dividend. 
</P>
<P>
And he thinks it's a mistake for investors to be put off by nervous economic 
forecasts. Both Lynch and Neff think reports of debt-burdened American 
consumers and corporations are overblown. Consumer interest payments, says 
Lynch, are a lower percentage of family income now than they were in 1970. And 
as for corporations, most of the major ones such as Digital Equipment, Boeing 
and General Electric have more spare cash than debt. "They are banks unto 
themselves," says Neff. 
</P>
<P>
What does that mean? That the companies may have values and capacity to earn 
income that remain to be fully recognized in higher stock prices. You can't 
predict whether a company's stock will rise tomorrow, Lynch explains in his 
book, but you can study its operations and draw conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to do the work, of course. Merely checking prices with a calculator 
and the newspaper is not work," he says. "Pull out the annual report, read the 
quarterlies and business news, keep abreast." 
</P>
<P>
And have patience. "The big winners I've had have come in the third, fourth or 
fifth years I've owned the stock," Lynch says. "I was underwater with Bank of 
America for three years." He bought BankAmerica stock at $20 a share, and again 
when it dropped to $15, because he could see that the company was cutting its 
costs. But losses on bad loans kept increasing and the stock fell. Finally, 
says Lynch, "it got to $8 or $9 a share and I bought 2% of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Now BankAmerica has gone back to $21 a share, and Magellan Fund has a gain on 
its investment. But what persuaded Lynch to stick with BankAmerica all the way 
down? It was noticing, even when the news seemed to portend bankruptcy, that 
loan losses were declining while cost reductions continued. "The fundamentals 
of the investment hadn't changed," says Lynch calmly. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, investing takes nerve and isn't as easy as Lynch suggests. But 
clearly, too, the amateur who does the work has a fair shot at the rewards.

STING IN CHICAGO SHOWS FBI'S NEW SKILL AT CRACKING 'CRIME IN SUITES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and LARRY GREEN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When FBI agents posing as representatives of a bogus Arab sheik began arresting 
congressmen for bribery nearly a decade ago in the famed Abscam sting, there 
were cries of outrage on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Similar expressions of shock and anger were heard last month when it was 
disclosed that FBI agents pretending to be commodities traders had spent months 
secretly tape recording conversations in the pits of the world's two largest 
futures exchanges here. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't a cocaine ring. This, at best, was a little white-collar crime," 
Thomas A. Crouch, a commodities broker who dealt with one of the undercover 
agents, complained to a Chicago newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of traders and brokers at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange have unexpectedly found themselves entangled in what 
appears to be the most ambitious and sophisticated undercover operation ever 
launched by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago undercover operation is graphic evidence to business executives who 
hide behind legitimate and often complex enterprises that they are not immune 
to the investigative tools developed over the years to go after criminals 
ranging from common burglars to mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as prosecutors and the FBI grow more adept at mounting undercover 
operations, they are turning their new skills more and more often on what U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh recently called "crime in the suites." 
</P>
<P>
But the use of these invasive techniques, coupled with the tough federal 
racketeering law, has prompted a chorus of protests from the pits of the 
commodities exchanges to the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal -- just 
as Abscam evoked howls from the halls of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dismisses Complaints 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the concern is that white-collar people who commit white-collar crimes 
don't like to consider themselves a part of the same social class as the Mafia 
or as the people who commit street crimes," said Geoffrey Miller, a 
constitutional law expert and dean at the University of Chicago Law School. "So 
they really object when their homes are searched or their telephones are 
bugged." 
</P>
<P>
Anton R. Valukas, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, has heard plenty of the 
complaints over the last few years and last few weeks. He finds no merit in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that just because people have a position of wealth or power in 
the community that they ought to be immune from prosecution," Valukas said last 
week in a rare interview. "That suggests that those individuals somehow are 
above the law or that we ought not use all the means at our disposal to 
prosecute those individuals because the means are tough and harsh. 
</P>
<P>
"To the contrary, I think that those are exactly the people who have 
traditionally been beyond the law and against whom these methods and means 
ought to be used." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere have undercover operations and racketeering laws been used more 
effectively than Chicago, where recent targets have ranged from corrupt judges 
and lawyers to city officials and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago has become, according to law enforcement officials, an incubator for 
the type of aggressive white-collar prosecution likely to turn up elsewhere in 
the country. One Chicago operation even had the title "Operation Incubator." 
The expertise gained here now is being shared with prosecutors from coast to 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
A close examination of the earlier Chicago operations, particularly at the 
effective techniques for persuading people to cooperate, offers a glimpse of 
how the current commodities investigation may proceed in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grown More Daring 
</P>
<P>
The examination also reveals how federal investigators have grown more daring 
and ambitious in combating white-collar crime since the end of the J. Edgar 
Hoover era at the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
During his 48 years as director, Hoover prohibited agents from operating 
undercover in criminal investigations because he feared his men would be 
corrupted by such firsthand contact with criminals. 
</P>
<P>
After Hoover's death in 1972, the bureau began to develop an interest in 
mounting undercover investigations. But the targets of those modest initial 
efforts remained traditional criminals -- mobsters, thieves and drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Even Abscam, the first undercover operation to capture the public's 
imagination, started out as an investigation of art thieves with ties to 
organized crime. It uncovered congressional corruption only by serendipity. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents lured congressmen to a Washington townhouse, where legislators were 
videotaped accepting cash in exchange for promises of arranging favors for a 
non-existent sheik. A senator, seven representatives and 11 others were 
eventually convicted. 
</P>
<P>
But it was through an investigation of corruption in the country's largest 
municipal court system in Chicago -- Operation Greylord -- that the government 
polished the art of the sting and laid the groundwork for its undercover 
investigation of the commodities exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Greylord was an intricately scripted undercover operation that at times seemed 
more like a made-for-TV movie than a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden in Cowboy Boots 
</P>
<P>
Phony criminal cases, complete with FBI agents posing as criminal defendants, 
were manufactured and sent on their way through Chicago's courts. Courtrooms 
and judges' chambers were infiltrated by undercover FBI agents acting as 
attorneys and wearing concealed tape recorders. A real judge cooperated and 
allowed the government to hide a tape recorder in his cowboy boots to document 
offers of bribes. 
</P>
<P>
Initial disclosures suggested that only low-level court personnel and one judge 
had been caught in the three-year investigation. But, in a technique common to 
undercover operations, prosecutors persuaded many small fry to provide 
information against the bigger fish. For instance, police officers who had been 
recorded taking bribes wound up providing evidence against the judges to whom 
they had delivered the money. 
</P>
<P>
Today, six years after the sting went public, more than 80 people have been 
convicted of bribery, conspiracy and racketeering. Among them are 12 judges and 
dozens of attorneys. And the government has lost only three cases. 
</P>
<P>
Greylord demonstrated convincingly to top Justice Department officials the 
value of undercover investigations, and the quality of the evidence they 
generate. 
</P>
<P>
"As aggressive as this office had been for over a decade in prosecuting 
corruption in Chicago, we were never able to successfully prosecute judges 
until we used the methods which were involved in Greylord," said Valukas, whose 
father is a respected Chicago judge. 
</P>
<P>
Miller agreed, saying: "Greylord really gave a tremendously good name to 
undercover investigations of the sting type. You had a (criminal justice) 
system that was unbelieveably corrupt and had been for years. The Augean 
stables needed to be swept, and Greylord was excellent at doing that." 
</P>
<P>
At the time the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI were conducting Greylord, the 
Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Chicago was operating an 
elaborate undercover operation aimed at more traditional targets -- organized 
crime and gambling. 
</P>
<P>
In Operation Safebet, two FBI agents posing as businessmen took over a credit 
card operation whose owner had come to the government in 1981 after being 
shaken down by organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
The business provided phony receipts for customers who used credit cards at a 
couple of lounges near O'Hare International Airport that were fronts for 
prostitution. Instead of showing that the credit card had been used at the 
lounge, the receipt used the name of a legitimate-sounding business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$970,000 Profit 
</P>
<P>
Under the stewardship of the government, the business expanded to perform the 
service for 15 to 20 lounges, gambling operations and escort services, many 
operating under protection of mobsters and high-ranking officers in the Cook 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the undercover portion of the investigation was closed down in 
1984, the credit card business had made a profit of $970,000 -- for the U.S. 
Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
And the illusion had been so successful that when the operator of an escort 
service was confronted by one of the undercover agents flashing his FBI 
credentials, she laughed and said: "Where did you get those? They look real." 
</P>
<P>
So far, 58 people have been indicted on various federal charges as a result of 
Safebet. Two of them are fugitives, two cases were dismissed and one mob 
associate was found shot to death in a car trunk. 
</P>
<P>
The 53 people convicted include several mobsters; five Sheriff's Department 
officers, including the chief of intelligence and the head of vice; operators 
of the houses, and two bankers who provided loans to crooks in exchange for 
kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
As often happens in an undercover operation, information was turned up that led 
to charges in unrelated crimes. Charges were brought in connection with an 
unsolved murder, and a Colombian drug ring was broken up. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only time we've ever had a sting where we were able to show the 
organized crime aspect of running an industry and the role of police and 
political protection," said Gary S. Shapiro, chief of the organized crime 
prosecution unit. 
</P>
<P>
Other undercover operations were being conducted in Chicago and elsewhere in 
the United States at the same time, including a successful penetration of 
municipal corruption in Chicago that triggered a larger investigation in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
But Safebet and Greylord showed how effective and sophisticated such operations 
could be. Greylord demonstrated that the government could penetrate places as 
sacrosanct as a judge's chambers with electronic bugs and agents wearing wires. 
In Safebet, the FBI operated a business successfully and gathered evidence at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The experiences were combined in 1985 when the FBI launched the first of two 
highly ambitious undercover operations aimed at the Board of Trade and the 
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Within the government, they were known as Operation Hedgeclipper and Operation 
Sour Mash, and they offered the prospects for an inside look at the highly 
lucrative and arcane world of futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serves as Central Casting 
</P>
<P>
The first stage in a major undercover operation involves collecting enough 
evidence to justify the expenditure of time and money. For example, the 
government spent well over $1 million in laying the groundwork for the 
commodities investigation. Potential targets must be deemed worthy of the 
operation, the undercover portion must be viable and a convincing argument must 
be made that the evidence is not available another way. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal and budget for a big undercover probe, known as a Group One 
investigation, is presented to a group of Justice Department lawyers and top 
FBI officials in Washington known as the Undercover Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Once a project is approved, the Undercover Committee serves as Central Casting 
for the operation, providing names and qualifications of agents around the 
country who can be brought in to play undercover roles. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole pool of people in the bureau with special skills," said 
Robert G. Long, an FBI agent in Chicago. "The guy who can pull it off as a 
banker may not work out posing as a drug dealer." 
</P>
<P>
In the commodities investigation, two young agents with backgrounds in 
accounting were brought in from FBI offices outside Chicago. They used the 
names Richard Lee Carlson and Michael D. McLoughlin and received training in 
the commodities business with the cooperation of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a 
major agribusiness that had complained to the government about the way the 
exchanges were operating. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other agents with similar backgrounds, who used the names Peter 
William Vogel and Randy George Jackson, were brought in as the probe expanded. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI created false backgrounds for the agents, listing previous employers, 
Social Security numbers and educational references. They also set them up in 
expensive apartments and bought them memberships at trendy health clubs so they 
would fit in with their prey. 
</P>
<P>
Some backgrounds were less than airtight. For instance, an official at Siena 
College in Loudonville, N.Y., said there was no record of McLoughlin graduating 
in 1981, although that was what McLoughlin listed on his commodities 
registration form. 
</P>
<P>
The official said, however, that Michael Bassett graduated from the school in 
1980. Michael Bassett was the name the agent used when he confronted traders 
during late-night visits to their homes to deliver grand jury subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar at St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., told The Times that the 
school has records showing that Jackson graduated with an accounting degree in 
1978. Quoting an unidentified source, the Chicago Tribune reported that the 
records were created at the request of the FBI as part of the agent's cover. 
</P>
<P>
But no one at the exchanges apparently checked the backgrounds, allowing the 
agents to work alongside the traders and brokers for months, recording 
conversations in an investigation that began unfolding last month. 
</P>
<P>
If it follows the patterns of Greylord and Safebet, the commodities probe may 
last years. The first charges, which could come within weeks, will likely name 
small players, just as the initial Greylord indictments focused on low-level 
police and court personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario is already being played out in lawyers' offices, with prosecutors 
and before a special federal grand jury: Traders and brokers who did business 
with the undercover agents have been subpoenaed and threatened with harsh 
sanctions usually used against organized crime figures if they refuse to 
cooperate in the government's efforts to catch bigger fish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Brokers Are Upset' 
</P>
<P>
According to defense lawyers, some traders have already "flipped" and begun to 
cooperate in the government's attempt to build cases against more influential 
traders, supervisory officials in commodities firms and possibly executives at 
the two exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate targets may be higher-ups in the back offices who knew what was 
going on and permitted it or benefited from it," said Susan Bogart, a defense 
attorney and former federal prosecutor. "Flipping the low-level traders in the 
pits would permit the government to obtain evidence which would explain the 
execution of trades and the corresponding paper trail that could lead higher." 
</P>
<P>
The elaborate and expensive commodities investigation is likely to be deemed a 
success only if it moves beyond the traders in the pits of the exchanges and 
implicates higher-ups the way Greylord did in the courtrooms. And that means 
that, before the end of the investigation, more protests are likely from 
targets and potential targets alike. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressmen were pretty upset about Abscam and the judges were pretty 
upset about Greylord," said Albert W. Alschuler, a criminal law professor at 
the University of Chicago Law School. "And now the commodities brokers are 
upset about this operation. But I don't know that the public is upset about 
it."

THEY DO IT ALL FOR A MOMENT IN HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Radford Polinsky recalls his moment of "living history" last June with an awe 
reserved for life's milestones or spiritual revelations. 
</P>
<P>
There he was, clad in a replica of the uniform of an 18th-Century British 
officer -- every detail, down to the number of threads per square inch, 
documented as historically accurate -- re-enacting a Revolutionary War battle 
in Evesham, N.J. He and his redcoat companions advanced in lock step down a 
hot, dusty road when they broke into a rendition of the regiment's somber 
marching tune. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived at Troutbeck for many a day 
</P>
<P>
 And now he has gone far, far away 
</P>
<P>
 That we'll ne'er hear his horn in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 20th Century melted away, and for those few moments I was in the 18th 
Century," Polinsky said. "Moments like that justify the whole darn hobby." 
</P>
<P>
Polinsky, 34, is a West Hollywood movie and television costumer who moonlights 
as a corporal in the British 33rd Regiment of Foot in Colonial America. 
Periodically, he and eight Southern Californian comrades in arms engage in a 
kind of time travel, back to an era when the pace was slower, hardships many 
and the fate of the rebellious Colonies was at stake on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
They are among an estimated 50,000 weekend warriors nationwide who spend 
thousands of dollars and untold hours re-creating the sights, sounds, crafts, 
folklore and feel of a particular epoch. Several hundred groups of these 
gung-ho recruits re-enact nearly every period of American military history -- 
the Vietnam War is one exception -- as well as earlier eras, such as the Middle 
Ages. 
</P>
<P>
"What motivates otherwise normal people to don neolithic furs, medieval armor, 
buck-ram shirts, or brain-tanned skins and dash into the time warp of living 
history?" wrote fellow historical re-enactor Jay Anderson in his 1984 book 
"Time Machine -- The World of Living History." 
</P>
<P>
His answer: a desire to escape the hustle and bustle of 20th-Century life; a 
"nostalgic preference for the past -- usually a particular epoch, and a 
curiosity about the nitty-gritty nature of everyday life in a specific 
historical period." 
</P>
<P>
Polinsky belongs to the Brigade of the American Revolution, the largest group 
in the nation specializing in 18th-Century living history. Founded in 1962, the 
brigade is dedicated to re-creating the look and experience of common 
Revolutionary soldiers. Its 1,700 members -- more than 200 of them from other 
nations -- drill regularly, stage mock battles, march in parades and set up 
weekend encampments. 
</P>
<P>
At the bivouacs, members, their wives and children cast pewter, carve wooden 
utensils, weave clothing and cook over open fires, all the while attired in 
Colonial garb. Talk of contemporary issues is taboo, though they do talk about 
sex in a bygone time and have "great" discussions of "period religion and 
period politics," Polinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The history buffs are such sticklers for authenticity that even the stews, 
beans and other foods they eat reflect 18th-Century fare -- up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"The park systems get upset with you if you start shooting their squirrels out 
of the trees to make a stew," said Hank Kayser, 42, a Simi Valley operating 
engineer who has doubled as a sergeant in an American regiment for the past 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Historians generally praise the brigade efforts to educate the public about the 
texture and tastes of the revolution even if, as one said, "They're not 
scholars. They're enthusiasts." 
</P>
<P>
John Dederer, a professor of military and strategic history at Yale University, 
relishes the atmosphere they create: "Just to see the black powder explode, the 
fog of battle -- with even a small squad, the amount of smoke is just 
incredible. It gives you a real feel for the period and a respect for the 
toughness of the people." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the brigade's 100-plus "reactivated" units nationwide replicate the 
ranks of Americans. But there are British, Hessian and French regiments, giving 
the Americans realistic-looking opponents at the mock battles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everything Is Documented' 
</P>
<P>
"We try to get away from the Hollywood image of what an 18th-Century soldier 
looked like," said William Radford, an industrial supplies salesman from 
Glenmore, Pa., and the brigade's national commander. "The equipment, the 
uniforms, the clothing that the women wear -- everything is documented by more 
than one piece of information." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the units are in California, which was being colonized by the Spanish at 
the time of the American Revolution. Both of them -- Kayser's nine-member 
American Delaware Regiment and Polinsky's 33rd British Regiment -- conduct 
twice monthly marching and musket drills at Los Encinos State Historic Park in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
There on Super Bowl Sunday, the American and British regiments -- in red, white 
and blue -- precisely crisscrossed a parched field under sunny skies. The 
backdrop included an orange grove, prickly pear cactus and a 1849 adobe house 
that was once the homestead for a longhorn cattle ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In a final drill before a dozen onlookers, the regiments took the field to the 
staccato bursts of the American drummer, and, stone-faced, marched toward each 
other behind bayonets menacingly extended on their muskets. This was not a 
matter of "shoot when you see the whites of their eyes" -- the bayonet charge 
stopped only when the opposing forces were yards apart. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, as the 20th Century noisily intruded overhead in the form of a 
circling police helicopter, the Delawares chanted, "Hip, hip, huzzah!" and 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Modern-Day Birthday 
</P>
<P>
The 33rd, meanwhile, dropped its military mien to celebrate a member's real 
birthday with a modern cake on a picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
The Californians have done programs at Knotts Berry Farm, appeared at Colonial 
Williamsburg in Virginia and marched in Memorial Day and Veterans Day parades. 
Members also speak to school and community groups; two are history teachers who 
use their outfits and period equipment in class. 
</P>
<P>
"Students learn so much more from them other than just reading," said Jeff 
Garcia, 32, an American history teacher at Garfield High and a member of the 
brigade's 33rd Regiment. At various time, he has shown up in his East Los 
Angeles classroom dressed as a Civil War soldier, a mountain man and a World 
War I combatant -- as well as a redcoat. 
</P>
<P>
As a British recruit, he said, he can convey that there are two sides to every 
conflict; the youngsters gain empathy for individuals from various historical 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
The Delaware Regiment was founded in 1976 by Kayser and four San Fernando 
Valley area friends who were initially motivated by the Bicentennial. Several 
are craftsmen who were drawn to a period when everything was still made by 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
The regiment they chose to replicate was a highly respected light infantry 
company from Delaware. It was established by the Continental Congress in June, 
1775. 
</P>
<P>
"The Delawares are the only regiment in the entire Army that never broke on the 
battlefield," said Don E. Dooley, a 20th-Century recruit from Huntington Beach 
whose sense of pride and use of present tense befits an original regiment 
member. "It's probably one of the two top units of the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unit Researched 
</P>
<P>
When the men applied to join the brigade, they undertook a time-consuming 
process of researching the unit, preparing a plan to re-create its clothing, 
weapons and other artifacts. It took them 1 1/2 years to be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Documentation was found in libraries at the University of California, the 
Smithsonian Institution, the Delaware Historical Society and the brigade's New 
York archives. 
</P>
<P>
The clothing is accurate to the thread count, Kayser said, explaining, "You 
have to use a micrometer and a ruler and a needle to make sure that you can 
match what is in the museum." He is an expert, working with his wife to make 
historical costumes for exhibits and living history groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Delawares' elaborate basic wardrobe: black shoes with a brass buckle; high 
white wool socks supported by a black garter; blue wool breeches with pewter 
buttons; a long-sleeve wool vest; a blue coat with a red collar and lapels; a 
scabbard for the bayonet; and a distinctive high black leather Delaware hat 
with a painted yellow insignia. 
</P>
<P>
"It drives me crazy," said Dooley, 22, a city planning intern who admits to 
harboring a near-obsession to obtain the right stuff. "I want to know exactly 
what they looked like." 
</P>
<P>
He said he plans to discard his $90 shoes because he found a cobbler who "makes 
the shoe the way it's supposed to be made." He is seeking someone to sew his 
wool socks because his pair's pedigree is unacceptable: They're machine-made. 
</P>
<P>
Verisimilitude has its price. An enlisted man's outfit costs $1,200 or more to 
make. Most unit members have several costumes. Polinsky, whose elaborate 
British uniform is more expensive, values his outfits from the Revolutionary 
War and World Wars I and II in excess of $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Members also carry British-, Italian- or Japanese-made reproductions of a Brown 
Bess musket, accurate only within 100 yards. They start at $250 and run into 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the tents, utensils and personal gear that make up an 
encampment. An industry has cropped up nationwide to supply historical 
re-enactors with such items. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the nine Delaware members and their six wives estimate that they 
have spent $200,000 on uniforms and gear, Kayser said. Cross-country trips, of 
course, have their costs. 
</P>
<P>
Both units also pay annual dues: $22.50 for the Delawares, $30 for the 33rd. 
The first $15 goes to the national brigade; the rest pays to publish monthly 
newsletters and buy black powder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Walks of Life 
</P>
<P>
The two California units have a professional cross-section, including two 
research biologists, an economist, a banking executive, a plant foreman, a 
dietitian, a truck driver, an aerospace engineer, a television producer and a 
warehouse worker. They range in age from 25 to 60 -- most in their 30s and 40s 
-- and travel from as far as San Diego to take up arms. 
</P>
<P>
There are Latinos but no blacks. This may reflect the reality that, most 
African-Americans were slaves in the Revolutionary Era, though some blacks did 
fight in the war. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone familiar with the revolutionary re-creations approves of them. The 
Delaware Regiment's leader, a San Fernando Valley man, asked that his name not 
be disclosed because his employer "feels it's a waste of my time." 
</P>
<P>
Polinsky acknowledged that the public perception of the hobby in some quarters 
is one of yahoos running around shooting old guns. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the brigade has tough safety rules: Men cannot affix bayonets for mock 
battles and muskets never are loaded with anything but blanks; they are 
elevated whenever fired. Musket sparks and artillery mishaps have caused 
injuries but no brigade member has been seriously hurt in recent years, 
national commander Radford said. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, brigade participants are accused of glorifying war. Their response 
is that tactical military demonstrations are only part of their activities. 
They add that wars have been an important part of American history. 
</P>
<P>
The Californians are a novelty in the brigade's ranks since most units are 
based in the Northeast, where much of the Revolutionary War was fought. When 
Dooley goes east for re-enactments, "People are always surprised when they hear 
I'm from California. They say, 'They know about the revolution out there?' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrender at Yorktown 
</P>
<P>
Recently he traveled to Washington Crossing, Pa., to participate in the annual 
re-enactment of George Washington's Christmas Day crossing of the Delaware 
River. Dooley would have prefered greater realism: crossing at night as 
Washington did rather than at midday and amid snow and hail instead of under 
the sunny skies that greeted the 1988 contingent. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley and others who live history most cherish the moments that author 
Anderson calls a "secular mystical experience" -- the feeling that they have 
actually re-entered the 18th Century. For many, this occurred in 1981 at 
Yorktown, Va., when 2,500 re-enactors restaged the Battle of Yorktown for 
President Reagan and French President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
For history teacher Garcia, it happened in 1987 at a re-enactment of the Battle 
of White Plains in New York. After a weekend living in a wooded encampment, he 
participated in a British bayonet charge, sans bayonets, at a line of Colonial 
soldiers and canon. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody just got carried into that moment," Garcia said. "We were thrust 
back into what possibly a charge have would have felt like." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, here too, the practical limitations were significant: Garcia did not 
face real bullets or canon fire as he raced across the field. 
</P>
<P>
The brigade seeks to reflect the violence of war even if it does so without 
bloodshed.

COLLEGE USES GENEALOGY AS A RECRUITMENT TOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

GETTYSBURG, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colleges have tried many tactics to attract capable minority students and make 
them feel welcome. They've offered scholarships, started support groups, hired 
counselors, overlooked low test scores. 
</P>
<P>
At Gettysburg College, they're about to try genealogy. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in March, this Lutheran-affiliated liberal arts school, where just 40 
of 1,850 students are black, is opening an "intercultural resource center" 
where all students, but especially African-Americans, can learn how to research 
their roots. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story, wood-frame center, when dedicated at a March 18 ceremony, will 
coordinate a campus-wide effort to help minority students develop 
self-awareness and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim: to break down the isolation that blacks often feel on this 
campus; to help them be part of the mainstream; and eventually to use their 
self-awareness to strive for leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Packed With Records 
</P>
<P>
Already, the center's shelves are packed with census records from 40 states, 
dating to the early 1800s. Thick brown volumes contain ship passenger and 
immigration lists dating to the 18th Century. There also are genealogy guides 
for Germans, Italians, American Indians, Danes, Finns, Russians and English. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that much about myself, and I want to know," said Dawn Hadnott, 
17, a freshman from Teaneck, N.J. "I think I have some Indian in me: my 
great-grandmother Moan." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a lack of pride in the black community," said Troy Datcher, a 
20-year-old junior who is president of the Black Student Union. "I think it can 
be rebuilt with a program like this. Maybe you can find out that you were 
related to someone famous." 
</P>
<P>
At a time of racial tension on many other campuses, Gettysburg's aim is to 
foster toleration through appreciation and knowledge of cultural diversity, 
says Harry Bradshaw Matthews, the school's 37-year-old "dean of intercultural 
advancement." 
</P>
<P>
If black students know more about themselves, the reasoning goes, they will be 
better prepared as minorities to fit into a college environment, and more 
inclined to stay the full four years. They also might be inclined to spread the 
word to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Items 
</P>
<P>
The new Gettysburg center is unusual on several counts. Probably no other 
school so small has focused such attention on African-American genealogy, said 
James Dent Walker, a founder of the Washington-based Afro-American Historical 
and Genealogical Society. Temple University in Philadelphia houses the Charles 
L. Blockson Afro-American collection, which contains more than 40,000 items. 
</P>
<P>
Gettysburg also pointedly chose not to name its facility an Afro-American 
Center or Black Student Center, as many colleges have, reasoning it was to be a 
campus place celebrating all cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Gettysburg may be the first college to view genealogy as a vehicle for 
recruiting and retaining minority students. That strategy may lack the glitz or 
quick-fix appeal of setting numerical minority recruitment goals or quotas as 
other colleges have, but Gettysburg never did. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews says he has already used his approach successfully as a minority 
counselor at two other predominantly white campuses, Northern Michigan 
University and the affiliated Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Now he confidently predicts: "Gettysburg will end up with a name across the 
United States, as a place for the advancement of African-American and other 
minority students." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gettysburg seems hardly the most fertile place for an innovative approach 
to black student recruitment, despite its location adjacent to the Civil War 
battlefield where Abraham Lincoln delivered his address that became an anthem 
in the history of race relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'All Too True' 
</P>
<P>
College guides, such as the "Yale Insider's Guide," have described Gettysburg 
students as "all alike," and "white and upper middle class." The descriptions 
are "all too true," president Charles Glassick admits. 
</P>
<P>
Black students at the school say that while seldom the target of overt racism, 
they often feel shunned and isolated. 
</P>
<P>
"Most students here never interacted with blacks, and at Gettysburg it's 
possible to avoid that," said Michael Warren, a 22-year-old senior majoring in 
African-American studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We were frankly interested in enrolling more minority students. So we brought 
in Harry Matthews," Glassick said. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 100 blacks were applying to Gettysburg each year, and the retention 
rate of those who attend had been "abominable," said Glassick. The rate was 46% 
in the 1970s, though that has recently improved to around 73%. 
</P>
<P>
Even with warm backing by the president and trustees, Matthews' arrival at 
Gettysburg in 1985 was not greeted with universal joy. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I feel welcome? No. It was a challenge," he said. "Some in the faculty and 
administration were looking for a more radical guy." 
</P>
<P>
Some called the conservatively dressed, soft-spoken Matthews an "Uncle Tom." 
Others wondered aloud why he and his ideas were worth scarce college dollars 
when they seemed geared to so few students. 
</P>
<P>
But when the college spent $450,000 to buy the building that eventually housed 
the center, it became clear to all that the center, and Matthews, were here to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews says he faced the same jolt that other black college students often 
find so trying. He grew up in Roosevelt, Long Island, a New York suburb where 
the public schools are mostly black. He wanted to attend historically black 
Fisk University but wound up at the mostly white State University of New York 
at Oneonta where financial aid was more generous. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the popularity of "Roots," the book and television miniseries by Alex 
Haley, sparked his passion for genealogy. "When 'Roots' came out, I made a 
pledge to trace my family before I had children," he said, a vow he has kept. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years of subsequent research led him to discover ancestors dating to the 
American Revolution. He believes his oldest ancestor was a Freedman known as 
Isaac the African who served in the 3rd Regiment of South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Starting Point 
</P>
<P>
The resource center will only be the starting point for such research. Students 
wanting to delve into their past still must go to the National Archives in 
Washington, talk to relatives, check state and county records of births, 
retirement records, marriage certificates and property deeds, just as any 
genealogist would. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Matthews hopes, the center will sponsor trips to archives in 
Washington and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Genealogy is especially formidable for blacks. Census data are helpful only to 
1870. It's almost impossible for most blacks to discover their ancestral Kunta 
Kinte, the character in "Roots" captured in Africa and brought to America on a 
slave ship. 
</P>
<P>
What may be possible, though difficult, is to trace lineage before 1870 by 
studying white slaveholding families. With black genealogy, Matthews said, "you 
just can't get around white folks. It's the only way."

FIRST PERSON: ONE READER'S TRASH IS ANOTHER'S TREASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I admit it: I love trash. 
</P>
<P>
I love the tawdry and the tasteless, the sensational and the shameless. I love 
celebrity gossip, "exploitation" films and television programs, tacky 
commercials -- nearly every component of our ever expanding junk culture. 
</P>
<P>
Some of my media-consuming habits may shock the serious-minded: Every week I 
buy People magazine, a major source of my trash fix. I scan the latest scoops 
from Liz Smith and other gossip columnists in the five papers I get daily -- 
often before reading the national news. A New York transplant, I still miss the 
New York Post's infamous "Page Six" (particularly its Murdoch incarnation). 
</P>
<P>
I would rather view the likes of "The Terminator" than "Out of Africa" or 
almost any movie with subtitles. And I have no moral objection to Saturday 
morning cartoons or Geraldo Rivera, although I do wish he would shave off that 
awful mustache. 
</P>
<P>
I know that an educated professional and a supposedly thoughtful person -- 
particularly one over 30 -- is not supposed to have such preferences. But I do. 
So do millions of others in all walks of life judging from the mega-dollars 
generated by America's pop culture. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite our numbers, we are anything but brazen about our brassy tastes. 
Most of us indulge them in secret, fearing society's disapproval. I cannot 
recall how many times I have instinctively hidden a newly purchased celebrity 
magazine between more "respectable" publications like Time and Newsweek -- or 
the Atlantic when feeling particularly guilty. Or how often I've begun 
confessing my proclivities with a self-effacing opening like: "I know I am a 
trash-mongering yahoo but . . . I thought 'Nightmare on Elm Street' was 
actually a good movie." 
</P>
<P>
One can't help being affected by the critics of junk culture, whose voices have 
become so loud recently in articles and newscasts condemning "trash TV" and 
other similar ills. These trashers of trash say it has no redeeming social 
value. That it doesn't teach morality and social issues. That it doesn't add to 
the nation's scientific knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
They say it will never teach us how to build a better space shuttle or compete 
with the Japanese. Trash culture, they conclude, is crowding the minds of the 
young, preventing them from learning these things. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I have long believed that such condemnations are, if you'll excuse 
the expression, just so much trash. If anything, one senses in the outcry a 
secret fascination, a certain defensiveness against stirrings from the dark 
side. What better indication of this than the ironic fate of some TV 
evangelists. Once known for fire-and-brimstone denunciation of various segments 
of junk culture, they ultimately became premier trash icons, thanks to their 
own moral foibles. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over trash calls to mind the Freudian description of the self, 
energized by tension between the violent, sexual id -- its animal side -- and 
the more civilized forces of the ego and superego. With its lurid facts and 
fictions, trash culture, I'm convinced, functions as our collective id. 
Uncivilized though it may be, it plays a vital role in our society as a source 
of energy and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
Trash culture provides an arena for us to let our hair down, to relax and 
engage in the fantasy and mental play that so often yields creative ideas. 
"Life Styles of the Rich and Famous," "Geraldo" and other trash fare may not 
add to our scientific store of knowledge. But they may help our scientists use 
their knowledge more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the inspiration value of so-called trash was suggested some years ago 
when NASA named its experimental space shuttle "Enterprise" -- a tribute to the 
classic TV series "Star Trek." Indeed, I believe it is no accident that the 
Soviet Union, a society that has long punished trash culture, must come to us 
for technological ideas. 
</P>
<P>
I am not recommending we embrace trash to the exclusion of traditional 
education. But we should allow it to coexist and appreciate its value. In 
addition to enhancing creativity, it has a number of other virtues. 
</P>
<P>
For example: Trash is entertaining. Man cannot live on tales of budget deficits 
alone. They would make him glaze over. Nor could most of us bear the tragedy 
and despair that floods the daily headlines without some kind of respite. 
</P>
<P>
Junk culture provides the perfect answer to the classic trash question: "How do 
you spell relief?" What is wrong with checking your brain at the door for an 
hour or two of "The Naked Gun"? Or spacing out a few minutes each day amid the 
latest delectable details of the Tyson-Givens divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Trash provides a sense of ongoing drama. Not all of us are astronauts or arctic 
explorers. Even for the most successful, life can become routine. Trashy 
celebrity melodramas played out in the media inject a sense of ongoing drama 
into our otherwise dull lives. They're better than fiction because they contain 
true suspense. You don't know how they will turn out. Will Fergie lose her 
pregnancy pounds? Will Prince Charles and Princess Di reconcile and live 
happily ever after? Will Cher dump her bagel-maker boyfriend from Queens? 
</P>
<P>
Trash is reassuring. Celebrity tales contained in our trash culture validate 
us. They show that famous people with all manner of talent and wealth can be as 
mixed up as we are -- or even more mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hart's dalliance with Donna Rice in full view of the media provided major 
comfort along these lines. "Phew," many of us thought. "We may have made 
mistakes in life. But at least we were never that dumb." 
</P>
<P>
As for those unfortunates among us who have been, it was nice to know there was 
someone out there of comparable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Trash teaches. Trash culture is far from the moral vacuum it is often judged to 
be. Trashy news stories are more than sagas of sex and violence -- they are 
powerful morality plays. "The Bess Mess" -- the story of a former Miss 
America's legal troubles -- is a modern retelling of the classic myth of 
hubris. 
</P>
<P>
Trash provides a way for society to come together and express shared emotions, 
such as outrage over the murder of young Lisa Steinberg. Or it may spark 
debate. Was Christina Onassis spoiled child or tragic figure? Was Tawana 
Brawley a victim or a perpetrator of a hoax? Answers to such questions 
delineate national moral conflicts that are hardly trashy concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Trash is a leveler. While a CEO and a cab driver lead vastly different lives, 
they may find common ground through talking about "Favorite Son" or "The 
Barbara Walters Special." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so trash is not high culture. But what it gives society is anything but 
junk.

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE: MICHIGAN IS DRIVEN TO SAVE ITS CAPITOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LANSING, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Martha W. Griffiths, 77, is fond of telling the story about how she 
could have become part of history. She's referring to the time a large chunk of 
the Capitol ceiling fell, damaging the commode in her office bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
No one was there at the time. But falling sections from Michigan's 110-year-old 
Capitol ceiling are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"The Capitol is decaying and falling apart before our eyes," said Senate press 
secretary Deborah Townsend. "Not only is the ceiling raining down, but chunks 
of limestone from the exterior of the building as well." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend, 35, was walking on the sidewalk recently when a piece of limestone 
from the Capitol fell to the ground, just missing her. "So far no one has been 
hurt by the building, as far as I know. But somebody could easily get beaned by 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the casual observer notes that architectural erosion is everywhere. Much 
has been destroyed, much has simply been covered up in this great Michigan 
treasure," notes a leaflet issued by the Friends of the Capitol, an 
organization dedicated to the restoration of the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to gain more space in the 1960s, a new floor was constructed nine 
feet above the original floor and the half floors were sectioned off with 
movable metal partitions, according to the leaflet. State workers call these 
extra floors "pigeon coops." 
</P>
<P>
From the outside, the new floor cuts across the center of each original tall 
window. Another blight is the sight of support columns, structural necessities 
that rise through the new "over-floor" and reach all the way to the old 
ceiling. The original ceiling, adorned with 19th-Century frescoes, is now 
obscured by a false drop ceiling of acoustical tile. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Echterling, 70, silver-haired, with an ample silver mustache, is the 
oldest uniformed officer in the Michigan State Police. A Capitol guard for the 
last 18 years, he knows the building as well as anyone working there. 
</P>
<P>
Echterling was an agricultural economist before becoming a guard. He is 
well-known in agricultural circles in Michigan and New Zealand, where he 
established egg-grading and poultry standards still used today. 
</P>
<P>
At 52, Echterling left agriculture to become a security guard at the Michigan 
Capitol. "I'm nuts about capitols," he explained. "I've spent a good part of my 
life visiting capitols, the U.S. Capitol and every state capitol except Alaska. 
I have been to Ottawa and the capitols of all the Canadian provinces and have 
visited capitols all over the world." Later this year, he and his wife, June, 
plan to visit the capitols of Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about a capitol, as I look at it, is that you can find out a lot 
more about a state or a country in its capitol than any other place," 
Echterling said. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this one best of all," he continued, referring to the Neo-Classic 
Michigan Capitol. "Yet it looks worse than all the rest. It hasn't been 
properly cared for. It has been abused for years. Just look at the 
dirt-encrusted dome. It probably hasn't been cleaned in 50 years. And those 
windows painted light green. Ugh!" 
</P>
<P>
But on the fourth floor, restoration of Michigan's 1879 Capitol has begun. At a 
cost of $1 million, the walls and ceilings of the committee rooms were returned 
to their original ornate splendor last year. 
</P>
<P>
When he became Senate majority leader four years ago, Republican John M. 
Engler, 40, said restoration of the Capitol would be one of his primary goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Until then, everybody had been terrified at the mention of restoration. It 
meant spending of taxpayer dollars," Deborah Townsend recalled. "But the 
Legislature agreed it was something that had to be done or we could lose the 
building." 
</P>
<P>
She rattled off a litany of problems: "Awful bus-stop furniture replacing 
original chairs in committee rooms, industrial paint covering ornate walls and 
ceilings, an etched-glass skylight with original seals of 36 states destroyed 
and replaced with a plywood ceiling, priceless Depression Era murals 
waterlogged when someone left a sprinkler system on. 
</P>
<P>
"But, hopefully all this will change with restoration," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It will take time, Engler added. "This year we will spend $6 million removing 
the half-floor in the Senate area and restoring the chamber to what it was 
during the first session in 1879." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, there had been talk of tearing down the Capitol and erecting a new 
one. But the people of Michigan like the building. It is architecturally 
significant, one of the first public buildings of its type and the first 
capitol designed by Elijah Myers, who went on to design capitols in Colorado, 
Utah, Idaho and Texas.

SNOW HELPS DEPUTIES TRACK LOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last week's blanket of white may have hindered Southern California motorists 
but it was a big help to Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in the Antelope 
Valley, who followed tracks in the snow to members of an alleged burglary ring. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies Don Self and Fred McNutt, who were responding Friday to a report of a 
burglary near 12th Street East and Avenue Q in Lancaster, discovered footprints 
leading away from the area. 
</P>
<P>
If that wasn't enough to make them curious, the square imprint of a television 
set that appeared every so often certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
Self and McNutt followed the tracks for several blocks to an apartment building 
in the 32000 block of 12th Street, Sgt. Ernie Roop said. They obtained search 
warrants for several of the building's apartments and discovered a cache of 
stolen goods that included car stereos, guns and several television sets. The 
investigators also seized a small amount of rock cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Five people who lived in several of the apartments were booked on suspicion of 
narcotics possession, receiving stolen property and burglary, Roop said. The 
names of the suspects were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Roop said the items are believed to have been taken in at least 20 burglaries 
in the Lancaster area.

</P>
<P>

2 WOMEN, 2 ABORTIONS PRODUCE CLASHING PHILOSOPHIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a secret and often shameful procedure before the Supreme Court legalized 
abortion in 1974, when Barbara Smith and Arlene Sontag each underwent it. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, full of those memories and flushed with the courage of their 
convictions, both Orange County women went to publicly demonstrate their 
opinions about abortion at a protest at a Los Angeles clinic. But for Smith, 
the purpose was to prevent more abortions, a procedure that she believes is 
murder. For Sontag, the goal was to preserve what she believes is a 
constitutional right. 
</P>
<P>
"I aborted a baby 18 years ago," said Smith, 45, of Costa Mesa, a "born-again" 
Christian now married to an Orange County contractor. "I didn't want my 
military career interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Deep down inside I knew it was wrong," she said. "My selfish motivation 
wouldn't let me acknowledge it." 
</P>
<P>
After she became a Christian 10 years ago, she was flooded with a sense of 
guilt, she said. She fell on her knees in her kitchen and wept. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was forgiven," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her purpose in joining the anti-abortion group Rescue, a new wave of protesters 
willing to be arrested for civil disobedience, was not to earn forgiveness, she 
said. "I want to save babies and save women from going through the pain I did." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is a crime against God, said Smith, a member of the small, charismatic 
Church on the Word in Mission Viejo. "It needs to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
On the question of whether women who have abortions should be treated as 
criminals, she said, "It's up to the courts to decide." 
</P>
<P>
Sontag, 52, of Anaheim said she and her husband had two children when they 
decided 27 years ago that they wanted to terminate her third pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
"My own gynecologist sent me to Tijuana," she said. "He wouldn't do it, but 
when I came back he filled a prescription" for antibiotics to ward off 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
The abortion was "dirty, filthy and frightening. There are no words to describe 
that kind of experience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion has been legal for 17 years. We're not going back." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the religious right is becoming more active, Sontag sees "a 
whole new resurgence" of pro-choice advocates among the young. At 5:30 a.m. 
Saturday morning, as she joined 100 others to defend the Family Planning 
Associates Clinic in Cypress against anticipated anti-abortion demonstrators, 
she saw that 80% of her group were young. It made her cry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
More men were willing to picket and protest too. 
</P>
<P>
Sontag came to the protest with her son Richard, a lawyer. She said he woke her 
up early Saturday morning, saying, "Let's go defend the Constitution."

CHILDREN OF NIGHT GETS GIRLS OFF THE STREET, BACK HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christina was a prostitute at 12, a mother at 15 and a heroin addict at 16. 
Now, almost 8 years after she left her house following a fight with her father, 
she's finally going home. This time, she says, it's for good. 
</P>
<P>
Christina is one of the success stories of Children of the Night, a Los 
Angeles-based project that tries to get young prostitutes off the streets. The 
organization, founded in 1979 by sociologist Dr. Lois Lee, has served almost 
5,000 youngsters, getting 80% of them off the streets and back home. 
</P>
<P>
Organization volunteers work Harbor and Beach boulevards in Orange County 
because they have become regular stops on the West Coast circuit for 
prostitutes. The streets, Lee says, are full of young girls like Christina. 
</P>
<P>
Christina (not her real name) knows the streets of Orange County well. It was 
in Santa Ana where she was last arrested for prostitution, and it was in the 
Orange County Jail where she decided she had had enough. In a telephone 
interview just hours before catching a plane back to Seattle, she told her 
story: 
</P>
<P>
"I was adopted when I was real young," she begins. "And one day my dad came 
home drunk and he was mad at me. He said, 'Since you don't want to follow my 
rules I'll tell you you are adopted and you can find your own parents.' I was 
really hurt by that. I was 12, you know. I got hurt real easy. (So) I went to 
downtown Seattle and met a girl, and from there it was history." 
</P>
<P>
Scared and alone, Christina latched on to the first person who was nice to her. 
It turned out to be a pimp named Gerald, the first of what would become a long 
line of pimps and protectors. 
</P>
<P>
"So I meet Gerald, and Gerald pretty much says, 'Baby, there is a better way, 
and if you come with me I'll show you.' I was looking for stability, and I 
figured he would be the person." 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks, Christina was converted from innocent sixth-grader to prostitute. 
She immediately went on the circuit with Gerald, driving to Seattle, Tacoma, 
Wash., Portland, Ore., and Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Everything she made went to Gerald. In turn, Gerald bought her food and 
clothes, paid for their motel rooms and bought her cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take It All 
</P>
<P>
"The pimps don't let you have nothing," she said. "They take it all. Oh, maybe 
some cigarette money. I was making $700 on an average night, anywhere from 
$1,000 to $1,500 on a good night. But they take it all. You don't give it to 
them and you've got trouble." 
</P>
<P>
She also learned, quickly, several unbending rules held by the pimps: no drugs, 
and keep yourself clean. A drug habit can be costly, and pimps don't want their 
girls spending his money on drugs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As for fear of AIDS, Christina said the circuit girls always use condoms. The 
pimps see to that. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want you getting sick," she said. "But hell, you can only take so 
many precautions. You can get it anywhere. It doesn't have to be a prostitute 
or a trick." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, she said, she "wasn't really scared because I didn't have any 
bad dates. In my later years I became hard. . . . Things have happened so many 
times to me. It doesn't faze me anymore. You have bad dates where someone tries 
to get their money back or rapes you or hits you. That happens a lot, 
especially in California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jungle Out There 
</P>
<P>
"It's a jungle out there. It can take your life. Cynthia -- she was a friend -- 
she was killed, and another girlfriend was stabbed in Portland. A man chopped 
Ceci's head off for taking his briefcase." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Gerald went to prison and, Christina said, she spent 9 months in a 
youth authority home near Seattle. The partnership broke up, but soon she was 
back on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I got out and met a man named Nate, who was another pimp. I met him in Oregon. 
Nate took me to San Francisco and Anaheim and Santa Ana, Hawaii, Houston, San 
Diego and Denver and Colorado Springs and Albuquerque. This is the circuit here 
in California. We'd keep moving." 
</P>
<P>
"We'd hit the highway. I didn't decide anything. I went where he wanted to go 
and I liked it. Pimps collaborate on where they think it might be going on . . 
. places that attract money or tourists. I just went where he told me to go." 
</P>
<P>
Christina said Orange County was on the circuit "because it's full of people 
that have plenty of money. At the beginning it was pretty easy, but at the end, 
just recently, the Santa Ana police got real hard on us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quit Prostitution 
</P>
<P>
Christina then became pregnant for the first time and had her first child. She 
quit prostitution just long enough to drop the baby off with her parents in 
Seattle and return. Last July she gave birth to her second child. That one too 
was dropped off with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
The fathers of both children were her pimps, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Christina said she left Nate 9 months ago and "I've been through about four 
(pimps) since then." She said it is common for girls to change pimps. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a law of the game," she said. "If a woman leaves, she has to go to 
another pimp. You give him a choosing fee and you go with him. The fee is 
anywhere from $500, tops $1,000. First of all you look for a pimp that doesn't 
do drugs with your money and one who will buy you clothes and make you look 
good, someone who looks to have something in life." 
</P>
<P>
"The pimps, they don't care if you leave. They just say, 'Man, we don't chase 
them, we replace them.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested in Crackdown 
</P>
<P>
Christina was arrested in a recent Santa Ana crackdown on prostitution. She 
spent 13 days in the women's jail and decided she would go home. When she was 
released last week, she called a 24-hour hot line operated by Children of the 
Night and was picked up and taken to the group's offices in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a pimp who was looking for me. I didn't want to see him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fed up; I'm through. Eight years is plenty to realize that there is a 
better way. I'm going back to Seattle tonight.

CYPRESS WILL VOTE ON ZONING FOR DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM and KEN YAMADA, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cypress residents will vote Tuesday on the controversial Cypress Downs, a 
proposed 167-acre project to transform a former public golf course into a 
business and recreational complex next to Los Alamitos Race Track. 
</P>
<P>
The measure -- the only item on the special election ballot -- is the 
culmination of years of debate and legal wrangling over how one of the largest 
remaining open spaces in northwestern Orange County should be developed. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the project have outspent opponents by nearly 5 to 1, pumping 
more than $215,000 into a mail and publicity campaign. Campaign records show 
that all but about $645 of the money was contributed by SDC Co., the Newport 
Beach firm that will buy and develop the land if the measure to allow a zoning 
change passes. 
</P>
<P>
"This has huge importance for us. There are a lot of things at stake in this," 
said 27-year resident Don Galloway, co-chairman of Cypress Citizens for 
Sensible Growth, which urges a "yes" vote. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Downs will produce $748,000 annually for the city, create about 7,000 
jobs and provide $10 million in traffic improvements along Katella Avenue, 
Galloway said. 
</P>
<P>
"And none of it costs taxpayers a dime," Galloway said. "The entire project 
will be funded by the developer." 
</P>
<P>
Galloway conceded that the development will increase the traffic in the area. 
"But with the traffic improvements, it is going to make (traffic conditions) 
better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the issue is the Concerned Citizens of Cypress for 
Greenbelt and Open Spaces Preservation. This group has raised only $25,989, 
which as of Feb. 3, when its financial report was filed, was not even enough to 
pay the committee's $38,870 in campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents say Cypress Downs will increase traffic and lower property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
"With all of their money," Councilwoman Gail Kerry said of the revenue raised 
by the development, "they will not be able to correct the traffic that they 
will be creating." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Geyer, treasurer of the group, maintains the increased traffic is 
something "we shouldn't have to live with." 
</P>
<P>
"All I see are a bunch of people leaving work and running into the patrons of 
the race track," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's president, Joyce Nicholson, said her group is not opposed to 
any development of the property, just "this specific plan." 
</P>
<P>
"It's too dense . . . and too much traffic," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we approve this plan, we will forever lose our recreationally zoned 
property and leave future generations justly accusing us with the question, 
'Why?' " Nicholson said in a statement appearing in the official sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress Downs project includes a business park, an office complex, a hotel, 
retail and commercial space and 31 acres for churches and schools. Under the 
current zoning, only churches and schools are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Downs would surround the Los Alamitos Race Track, bordered on the south 
by Katella Avenue, on the north by Cerritos Avenue, on the west by Denni Street 
and on the east by Walker Street. 
</P>
<P>
SDC Development agreed in May, 1988, to buy the entire 300-acre parcel, 
including the 140-acre race track, from Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises for 
$100 million. The sale, however, is contingent upon approval of the zoning 
change by voters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the sale goes through, Hollywood Park will continue to operate the race 
track under an agreement with SDC. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress Downs project is scaled down from what Hollywood Park originally 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 Hollywood Park asked the Cypress City Council to rezone the land for a 
business park, the Cypress Plaza, which the city did. 
</P>
<P>
By late 1987, Hollywood Park had closed the Los Alamitos Golf Course next to 
the race track. But preservationists and supporters of the golf course mounted 
a petition drive and persuaded the council to rescind the zone change. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a coalition of Cypress residents in November, 1987, won voter 
approval of Measure D, which returned the site's zoning to semipublic or public 
use and required voter approval of any further zone changes for the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park sued the city for rescinding the zoning change, and last May an 
Orange County Superior Court judge invalidated Measure D. The city has appealed 
that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SDC Development and Hollywood Park agreed to put a scaled-down 
proposal to a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
Should Tuesday's ballot measure pass, Hollywood Park and SDC have agreed to 
terminate lawsuits still pending against the city, according to a statement by 
the city attorney in the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"SDC went into this with a different focus," Galloway said. "They wanted more 
corporate-type businesses." 
</P>
<P>
The original plan called for 3.7 million square feet of building area. The new 
Cypress Downs plan provides for 2.6 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The original Cypress Plaza project was expected to generate 45,000 total 
vehicle trips, according to an environmental impact report prepared by the 
city. The smaller Cypress Downs project will generate only marginally fewer 
trips -- 43,568, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
However, the project calls for traffic management efforts such as ride-share 
and car-pool plans by employers. Those, coupled with physical improvements to 
Katella Avenue, mean "acceptable levels of services are anticipated," according 
to the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
But traffic is only one problem opponents have with the Cypress Downs project. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson argues that property values will decline because "people don't want 
to buy homes next to a commercial-industrial development." 
</P>
<P>
However, Cypress Downs supporter and City Councilwoman Cecilia L. Age, a vice 
president of operations in the real estate division of a bank, argues that the 
development will improve the area, consequently raising property values. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything, the houses are going to appreciate," Age maintains. Property 
values decline only when homes directly back up an industrial area, she said. 
</P>
<P>
As the debate has raged, Councilman John Kanel has been distressed by the 
schism created by the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"This matter is to be decided by the voters on Valentine's Day, a day that's 
supposed to be full of love and happiness," Kanel said. "But instead, there are 
many people in this community who are divided. This is very unfortunate."

1 KILLED, 2 HURT AS SIDESWIPED PICKUP VEERS OUT OF CONTROL, HITS CAR ON PCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was killed and two people were injured Saturday when the driver of a 
pickup that was sideswiped on Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach lost 
control and collided with another vehicle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Proios, 27, of Costa Mesa was pronounced dead at the scene after his car 
was hit on the driver's side and then flipped over. His wife, Lisa Proios, 23, 
was in serious condition at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center with broken ribs, Huntington Beach police said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lieber, 44, of Huntington Beach, the driver of the other vehicle, was also 
listed in serious condition at the hospital with a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 2:20 p.m. on Pacific Coast Highway, just west of 
the Santa Ana River bridge and east of Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Lieber was westbound on the highway in a pickup when a gold 
station wagon with several men inside swerved into her lane, forcing her onto 
the sandy shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The pickup swerved across the westbound lanes and into the eastbound lanes, 
striking Proios' car and causing both vehicles to flip over.

PHILADELPHIA STORY; 
</P>
<P>
UC IRVINE'S SCOTT BROOKS HAS TAKEN A ROUNDABOUT ROUTE TO HAPPINESS IN THE NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Is this a great country or what? 
</P>
<P>
In six years, Scott Brooks has gone from Horned Frog to Anteater to Patroon to 
Philadelphia 76er. Me? Oh I'm staying with a teammate of mine, perhaps you've 
heard of him. Charles Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
One moment a guy is too small to play in the National Basketball Assn. and is 
happy to find work in the Continental Basketball Assn.; the next he's the 
starting point guard for the team of his dreams, the 76ers, and in so doing 
develops something of a cult following. 
</P>
<P>
"Philadelphia has been real good to me," Brooks said while watching the 
Fullerton-Irvine game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
How good? Try a Scott Brooks poster, with California boy Brooks standing on a 
beach in his 76er uniform holding a surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that Brooks grew up landlocked near Modesto in a town called 
Lathrop. Cowabunga. 
</P>
<P>
But what are facts in the face of a burgeoning legend? The posters were given 
away during Scott Brooks Night at Philadelphia's Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave everyone 5-11 and under a $4 discount on their ticket," Brooks said. 
"They got a pretty good turnout." 
</P>
<P>
Said Barkley: "He's the little, little guy everybody wants to do good in life." 
</P>
<P>
The little, little guy is 5-feet-11. He has always had a certain strut to his 
dribble drive, a chest that seemed perpetually puffed. A UC Irvine teammate, 
Joe Buchanan, dubbed him Coffee Mocha because, "his game has a certain funk to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
All of that, and the fact that he led the West Coast in scoring (23.8 per game) 
his senior season (1986-87), got Brooks a lot of admiring looks. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a good little player at Irvine," said NBA scout Marty Blake. 
"Anyone who averages 23 points a game can play the game." 
</P>
<P>
But the pats meant nothing come put-up time. Brooks wasn't drafted in 1987, 
even though the Washington Bullets picked 5-3 Tyrone Bogues in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"When he (Bogues) went I thought I would too," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Blake summed up the book on Brooks when he said: "I thought he'd be perfect in 
that 6-4 and under league." 
</P>
<P>
Well, the 6-4 and under league is nowhere to be seen, but there is a growing 
number of short players on NBA rosters. Consider that during the 1986-87 
season, only two players under 6-feet -- Spud Webb and Michael Adams -- were in 
the NBA. At the start of the 1987-88 season, there were nine players under 
6-feet in the league, which paved the way for Scott Brooks, an idea whose time 
had come. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very thankful to players like John Stockton and Spud Webb," Brooks said. 
"They've made it possible for someone like me to make it. I think teams are 
actually looking for one player under 6-feet now, because they make things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks has had more of an opportunity to make things happen while Maurice 
Cheeks, the 76ers' usual starting point guard, has been injured. Though 
averaging five points per game for the season, Brooks has been in double 
figures in each of his six starts. 
</P>
<P>
He had a career-high 18 against Washington. He's averaging about five assists a 
game, and even when Cheeks is healthy, he's playing 15 to 20 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
So Scott Brooks is the latest in the NBA's growing collection of short stories. 
Watching him sign autographs and be generally revered upon his return to Irvine 
Saturday -- he had a couple days off because of the All-Star break -- one could 
only surmise that this was the stuff of a happy ending. But he's had his share 
of dramatic tension. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has come easy for me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Irvine after playing one season with the Texas Christian University 
Horned Frogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Liked the school, hated the state," is how Jim Killingsworth, TCU coach 
explained Brooks' departure. 
</P>
<P>
At Irvine, Brooks eventually blossomed into a big-time scorer. He shot ceiling 
scraping jumpers, something he taught himself to do when he was a 4-11 high 
school freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing he brought from growing up was a work ethic bordering on 
possessed. While at Irvine he would regularly practice on his own after 
practicing with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically put himself through two-a-days all season," said Mike Hess, a 
teammate of Brooks and now an assistant at Irvine. "He worked so hard. He, I 
and Wayne Engelstad used to live across from a Boys' Club, and Scott would 
constantly be over there working out." 
</P>
<P>
But when his college career ended, the NBA never called. He considered Europe 
and the 6-4 and under league, but ended up playing for the Albany Patroons of 
the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to Albany is what got him in the the NBA," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks turned from scoring to passing, pushing the ball upcourt and playing 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He became a much more rounded player," said Bill Musselman, Brooks' coach in 
Albany and now head coach of the NBA expansion Minnesota Timberwolves. "The NBA 
isn't interested in 6-foot scorers, they want guys who are going to make a lot 
of things happen with the pass or playing defense." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Brooks can do that and because, as Musselman observed, "He's the 
toughest kid pound for pound I've ever seen," he's found a home in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are really going great," Brooks said, while signing yet another kid's 
program.

AGGRESSIVE FULLERTON GETS STANFORD ON RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's baseball team stepped slightly out of character Saturday 
with a 5-2 victory over Stanford in a nonconference game in front of about 800 
at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton came in with one stolen base in its first three games but stole two 
against Stanford, both leading to runs. The Titans also had a runner picked off 
and two more thrown out trying to steal. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to be a little more aggressive than normally," Fullerton Coach 
Larry Cochell said. "We wanted to put the pressure on the defense by trying to 
make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' final bit of aggressiveness resulted in their last run in the sixth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
With one out, Rod Klopfer singled and moved to second on a balk. He stole third 
and continued home when Stanford third baseman Roger Burnett had the throw from 
the catcher go off his glove for an error. 
</P>
<P>
Klopfer's run gave Fullerton a 5-1 lead. Fullerton had scored a pair of runs in 
the second to lead, 2-1, and two more in the third for a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
For seven innings, the lead was well protected by starter Huck Flenner, a 
sophomore left-hander, who allowed only one run. 
</P>
<P>
But in the eighth, Flenner tired. After his second walk of the inning, he was 
replaced by Sam Colarusso, a junior right-hander from Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Colarusso walked Tim Griffin to load the bases with two outs, then threw a wild 
pitch to allow a run. He fell behind David Holbrook, three balls and a strike 
before getting him to fly to Trevor Neighbors in right field to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Colarusso got a pair of strikeouts in the ninth as he retired Stanford for his 
first save. Flenner (1-0) allowed four hits and four walks and had seven 
strikeouts for Fullerton (3-1). 
</P>
<P>
The first sign of Fullerton's willingness to run came in the second when Ralph 
Ramirez stole second on a broken hit-and-run play. It was the first steal for 
Ramirez at Fullerton. Ramirez, a senior from Orange Coast College, did not 
steal a base in 42 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez scored from second when Mate Borgogno lined a bad-hop double to center. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Jones time an off-speed pitch from Stanford starter and loser Ben Keyser 
and hit it well over the left-field fence for his first home run of the season 
to open the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors followed with a single and later scored on a groundout by Ramirez to 
give Fullerton a 4-1 lead. Rich Gonzales had three hits for Fullerton, which 
had nine. Stanford (4-5) had four hits. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans will try to complete a sweep of Stanford in the three-game series at 
5 p.m. today at Fullerton.

SCC BREEZES PAST CHRIST COLLEGE FOR THIRD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California College won its 13th consecutive game Saturday with a 
126-74 victory over Christ College Irvine in a Golden State Athletic Conference 
game at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without leading scorer center Jeff Bickmore, who was sick with the flu, 
SCC relied mostly on the outside shooting of guards Kyle Lundy and Todd Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of fun seeing five guards running down the court and dishing off 
to everyone," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "They're so unselfish, it's fun to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon scored 24 points, and had four assists and six steals. Lundy scored 26 
points and had seven assists. Guard Jim Mansfield added 16 points and 8 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought we stayed pretty focused in the second half," Reynolds said. 
"This is a team we can always put away because of their inexperience, but I was 
proud of the way they kept up the intensity." 
</P>
<P>
SCC (22-2 overall, 10-0 in league play) defeated Christ College on Jan. 6, 
132-67, and on Jan. 20, 120-75. Christ College Irvine (4-22, 0-10), hasn't won 
a conference game in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard for us to get up for this game since we knew we were going to beat 
them," SCC's Terrance Jackson said. Jackson came off the bench in the second 
half to score 11 consecutive points. He finished with 16.

FIREPOWER AT LA QUINTA;

<P>
JALEWALIA SCORES, REBOUNDS -- AND PASSES THE NEWS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Need a couple of points? Amy Jalewalia will score them. Inside or out, layup or 
jump shot, off the dribble or off the pass, La Quinta High School's versatile 
basketball player can score. 
</P>
<P>
Need three points? No sweat. Jalewalia has made 27 of 52 three-point shots this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Need the results of the game phoned to the local paper? Jalewalia does that 
too, but she draws the line at picking up shirts from the laundry. She is too 
busy taking opponents to the cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, a 6-foot-3, 130-pound junior, leads the Southern Section in scoring 
with a 31.2-point average. She gives new meaning to the term triple-threat, 
having played guard, forward and center. She is an obvious choice, with some 
consideration to Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel, to succeed Katella's Joni 
Easterly as the premier girls' basketball player in Orange County next season. 
</P>
<P>
She leads her team in every statistical category, including assists (4.5 per 
game) and rebounds (13), and helped La Quinta (21-3 overall, 14-0 in league 
play) capture its eighth consecutive Garden Grove League title and win its 40th 
consecutive league game. The Aztecs are ranked third in the Southern Section 
3-A. 
</P>
<P>
And while her coach, Kevin Kiernan, is busy doubling as a boys' varsity 
assistant, she phones results, including her statistics, to the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove League is not exactly the hotbed of Orange County girls' 
basketball and that accounts, in part, for Jalewalia's scoring dominance. But 
it would be a mistake to think that's the primary reason. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia plays on a team with no senior starters. When she scores, much of the 
time she does it on her own. (After Jalewalia, the team's assist leader is Lucy 
Wong with 3.7 a game.) 
</P>
<P>
"She creates so much on her own off steals, off the press, she pulls up for 
jump shots," Kiernan said. "If we had a true point guard who pushed it up the 
floor and could distribute the ball a little better, it would be scary how many 
baskets Amy could score." 
</P>
<P>
It's downright frightening for Garden Grove League opponents to know she has 
her senior season left to play, especially considering the strides she has made 
each season. 
</P>
<P>
She was a part-time starter as a freshman. She spent the month of December in 
India attending a cousin's wedding and visiting relatives. When she returned, 
she injured her left knee. She recovered but was sidelined again with a stress 
fracture in her foot, which kept her out of the Aztecs' quarterfinal playoff 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Jalewalia averaged about 13 points a game and was voted the 
Aztecs' most improved player. 
</P>
<P>
She has more than doubled her offensive production this season, proving herself 
worthy of the most improved plaque she won last year. She keeps that and her 
other basketball memorabilia in her room. The collection includes team 
pictures, trophies, a poster of Michael Jordan -- "because he is a cool player" 
-- a piece of a Rancho Alamitos jersey, the Aztecs' toughest competitor in 
league play; and a bumper sticker for Louisiana Tech that reads: "Lady 
Techsters, National Champs Again." 
</P>
<P>
She picked up the sticker at the university while playing for an Amateur 
Athletic Union basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went to Louisiana, the teams were really good," she said. "It made me 
think you've really got to work hard because there are a lot of better players 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Her intent to become a complete player has Jalewalia focusing on aspects other 
than scoring. And considering she would rather pass than shoot, her offensive 
accomplishments are all the more phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer it if we had more balanced scoring," Jalewalia said. "It would 
take a lot of pressure off me and give the team a bigger boost. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I get out of high school, I know I am not going to be scoring like this. 
You've got to prove yourself as a defensive player too. I don't know, I just 
try not to concentrate on just score, score, score. If the scoring comes, good. 
But I would like to just get back to defense." 
</P>
<P>
Kiernan has her working on improving her intensity and developing the "innate 
toughness" he sees reflected in the eyes of players such as Easterly and 
McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of this comes easy to her," Kiernan said. "You watch her play 
and it is just so easy. She uses the left hand, she uses the right hand, she 
just moves so well, and sometimes the level of the game drops and she can get 
by playing half speed." 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia started playing basketball with her mother, Sharon, who played some 
as a 5-7 forward at Marylhurst College in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball was my favorite sport when I grew up, so it was my interest to 
teach her," Sharon Jalewalia said. She began by taking Amy to watch Deepak, 
Amy's older brother, play in recreation games. 
</P>
<P>
"She and I used to go and shoot around and just have fun at the park. Her 
brother played a lot of sports and I used to take her along. During halftime or 
warmups, I used to throw her the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Amy's father, Gurpreet, is from India. Amy is short for Amardeep, which means 
"always the source of light" in Punjabi. 
</P>
<P>
With an inexperienced and untested team heading into the pressure of the 
playoffs, Kiernan is looking to Jalewalia to light it up. He also wants to keep 
things light. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year we went in real tight and just played not to lose," said Kiernan, 
whose team was eliminated in the second round of the playoffs and finished 
22-4. "This year we're going to have some fun in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you've got a player like Amy, you never know. You've always got a 
shot."JALEWALIA BY GAME

MATER DEI SOCCER TEAM WINS LEAGUE TITLE, 1-0

Mike Ammann scored the game's only goal with 13 minutes gone in the second half 
to give the Mater Dei High School boys' soccer team a 1-0 victory over Servite 
in Saturday's regular-season finale at Mater Dei. The victory clinched an 
Angelus League championship for Mater Dei (11-8, 7-1). 
</P>
<P>
Ammann, who was the team's goalkeeper until he was moved to the attacking line 
during the Monarchs' first league game against the Friars, got his fourth goal 
of the season Saturday. After taking a pass from Shawn Wyns, he dribbled the 
ball into the penalty area and fired a low-angle shot that eluded Servite 
goalie Dominick Sarno. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei finished league play a half game ahead of second-place Bishop 
Montgomery (13-5-5, 6-1-1), which was ranked eighth in the Southern Section 
4-A. Servite (5-9-4, 3-3-2) finished third. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been great seeing how these guys have come through after the adversity we 
had earlier in the season," said Mater Dei Coach John O'Neil, who was 
suspended, along with several members of his team, after some players drank 
alcohol at a team outing in December, "Our suspension set us back two weeks, 
but the kids worked hard despite that and are beginning to jell as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rich Manning, Servite coach: "How this team has come back after their 
adversity tells you what kind of a soccer program they have at Mater Dei. It 
shows you what kind of talent they have up and down the school." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, which kept the ball in Servite territory most of the contest, was 
unable to convert on several opportunities before Ammann's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Servite's offense was frustrated by the work of defenseman Jason Blair, who 
held Servite's leading scorer, Erwin Garcia, to one shot from outside the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, who scored a goal during Servite's earlier loss this season to the 
Monarchs, scored 10 of his 12 goals in league play this season. Mater Dei 
goalie Chip Packard recorded the shutout. AL PRESTON

FIREPOWER AT LA QUINTA; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPBELL CAME WITH A REPUTATION, AND SURPASSED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Campbell's reputation reached La Quinta High School long before he ever 
set his Size-12 feet on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell hailed from Broomfield, Colo., a mere snowball's throw from Denver, 
where he was star of the undefeated Broomfield High School freshman basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
This kid could shoot, rebound, he could even dunk. Or so La Quinta Coach Jim 
Perry was told. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear this kind of thing a lot, some all-world kid is moving into your 
area," Perry said. "Some pan out, some don't." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Perry wasn't exactly reserving a spot on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell arrived in November of his sophomore year, Perry told him there 
would be a tryout session for kids who had not been a part of the Aztec program 
the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
"The first night Scott came to the gym, my assistants and I were watching him 
shoot," Perry said. "I jokingly said to him, 'I understand you can dunk.' He 
smiled, bent over to pick up a basketball, jumped straight up and did a 
two-hand reverse dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned to my assistant and said, 'Tryout's over.' " 
</P>
<P>
For three seasons, Campbell has been impressing Perry, while depressing 
opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
His shooting range extends beyond the two-hand reverse-jam, about 20 feet 
beyond. Basically, Campbell is a jump shot just waiting to happen -- and it 
usually happens. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is a natural shooter, but he still works to perfect his craft. In 
Broomfield, when it was too cold to ski, he would go shoot at the gym, which 
was 2 minutes by foot -- or snowshoe -- from his house. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell from the first time I saw Scott that he was a shooter," Perry 
said. "There's an air about good shooters, you can tell. It's not arrogance, 
but a confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has been confident to the tune of 30 points per game this season, 
which is the main reason the Aztecs are Garden Grove League champions. 
</P>
<P>
At one point during the season, he scored 30 or more points in eight 
consecutive games. Included in that streak was a 53-point performance against 
Bolsa Grande, which broke Johnny Rogers' school record of 52. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just that Campbell scores, it's the ease with which he does it. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell will drift upcourt, almost casually. The next second, he'll roll his 
6-foot-4 frame off a screen for a 15-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
"The best you can do is try to fight through the screen and hope he doesn't 
make the shot," Rancho Alamitos Coach Terry Munson said. 
</P>
<P>
It's so effortless, yet so effective, that sometimes even Campbell doesn't 
realize how many points he has. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime of the Bolsa Grande game, Campbell was listening to Perry address 
the team when assistant coach Kevin Kiernan sat down next to Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach was talking and Kevin whispered to me, 'You have 34 points,' " said 
Campbell, who averaged 14 points per game as a sophomore and 18 as a junior. "I 
was shocked. I thought maybe I had 15 points." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell broke Rogers' record with 5 minutes left in the game and then took the 
rest of the night off. Had he stuck around, Campbell had a chance to break Art 
Worthy's Orange County record of 58 points, set in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
However, records weren't what Campbell was shooting for that night, according 
to Perry. He said the performance was out of necessity, as the Aztecs were 
missing starting guards James Johnson and Scott Linck with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, people kept asking me, 'Do you think Scott can do that again?' 
" Perry said. "I told them no, not unless we had other players who were sick or 
hurt again. Scott has done what he's had to do all year to make us as good as 
we can be. On that particular night, 53 points was something he had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Perry is accustomed to seeing Campbell do whatever is necessary, even providing 
a little extra effort on defense. 
</P>
<P>
Although Campbell describes himself as an average defender, he dominated a 
4-minute stretch against Rancho Alamitos this season with his defense. 
</P>
<P>
He made four consecutive steals during that stretch, including one that 
required Campbell to leap out of bounds and toss the ball over his shoulder to 
Linck, who scored on a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody, especially the fans, could see he was in total control," Munson 
said. "It looked like a man playing with boys. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly glad he's leaving after this season. But I wish he would have 
come to Rancho instead of La Quinta." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell landed at La Quinta because of some family research and a little luck. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Campbell, Scott's stepfather, was transferred from Colorado to Southern 
California by McDonnell Douglas in the fall of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's mother, Sandy, contacted principals, athletic directors and/or 
basketball coaches at Bolsa Grande, Garden Grove, La Quinta, Rancho Alamitos 
and Santiago, all located in the general area where the family wanted to live. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells have four children, but only Scott was interested in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
So, whatever school district the Campbells moved into would have to include a 
high school with a good basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make sure that my kids had the best opportunity," said Sandy 
Campbell, who besides Scott has a daughter and two stepsons. "La Quinta seemed 
to be the best school for all of them. And, after talking to Jim Perry and 
checking out his program, I knew he would be absolutely wonderful for Scott." 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells leased a home in the La Quinta district and planned to move there 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
But a week before the move, a family friend who lived in the area called and 
said there was a problem with the house. Another family had moved in, claiming 
they had leased it. 
</P>
<P>
"The people that owned the house . . . rented it to three different families 
and then took off with the money. We've never found them," Sandy Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
So, Scott spent his first two weeks in California living in a motel room across 
from Disneyland while his parents searched for a house. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great being in California, but there was no place to play basketball," 
Campbell said. "I was itching to play again." 
</P>
<P>
After his parents bought a home in Westminster -- within La Quinta's boundaries 
-- Campbell enrolled in November. 
</P>
<P>
On his first day of school, he went to see Perry at lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, maybe I would be on the junior varsity my first year," Campbell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, was before the quickest tryout in school history.

BUILDER-ACTIVIST NATHAN SHAPELL IS DRIVEN TO DEVELOP SOME BIG IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a developer and as chairman of the Little Hoover Commission, a public 
watchdog agency, Nathan Shapell has forged a reputation as a take-charge guy. 
Several years ago, during a commission meeting, Shapell told a federal 
education official that California's schools were a mismanaged mess. 
</P>
<P>
"They could turn it over to me and I could run it," said Shapell, a millionaire 
Beverly Hills developer. "You go back to Washington and tell Ed Meese that Nate 
Shapell says we've got to clean up this mess." 
</P>
<P>
Even by Shapell's standards, he has plenty to keep him busy these days. 
Shapell, 69, is the man behind an ambitious $2-billion proposal to develop 
1,300 acres in the Porter Ranch area of Chatsworth. The rolling hills just 
north of the Simi Valley Freeway were purchased in the late 1970s from 
California Federal Savings &amp; Loan by Shapell's Beverly Hills company, 
Shapell Industries, and by Liberty Building Co. of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3,000 Homes Planned 
</P>
<P>
Shapell's company owns 75% of Porter Ranch Development Corp., which last month 
announced plans to develop 3,000 homes and 7.7 million square feet of office 
and retail space on the site over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
But his plan is still only in the idea stage. The first public hearing on the 
proposal is scheduled for later this month. Northwest San Fernando Valley 
residents and merchants have already voiced concern about the proposal. "Our 
major concern at this point is the traffic because that's a phenomenal project 
in size and scope," said David R. Miller, president of the Granada Hills 
Chamber of Commerce. "There's also a concern that a complex that size would 
ruin the small-business community in Granada Hills and Chatsworth." 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development representatives have maintained that the fast-growing 
West Valley needs the additional housing and can accommodate the proposed 
1.5-million-square-foot regional shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
If Shapell pulls it off, it would be one of the biggest land developments in 
the history of Los Angeles County. But Shapell has overcome long odds before. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a hard-driving person," said Richard C. Mahan, a vice president of 
Shapell Industries. "He wouldn't be alive today if he wasn't a hard-driving 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Shapell is a survivor of the notorious World War II death camp at Auschwitz. 
After the war, Shapell worked in Germany finding housing for displaced people 
in the community of Munchberg. In the 1950s he and his brother David and 
brother-in-law Max Webb moved to the United States and settled in California, 
convinced that its real estate market offered plenty of growth. After a few 
years they began their own real estate development company. 
</P>
<P>
Privately owned Shapell Industries did about $400 million in sales last year 
and employs 425 people, Mahan said. Shapell continues to run things as chairman 
and president. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell is no stranger to large projects. Among his 30 or so developments in 
California is the former MGM Ranch in Thousand Oaks, where Shapell is building 
more than 1,400 homes and a 102-acre industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell also is building the 860-acre planned community of Eastlake Village in 
Yorba Linda and the 600 luxury home community of Kite Hill in Laguna Niguel. 
Shapell and builder Jona Goldrich are partners in the $60-million Promenade 
Towers, a 510-unit apartment project in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaped Character 
</P>
<P>
Shapell's experience in Europe during and after the war helped shape his 
management style of tempered ruthlessness, associates said. One former Shapell 
employee, who asked that his name not be used, left Shapell Industries after 
several years because of the pressure. "There were some very bright people who 
couldn't take it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the other side of Shapell is the community activist, the giver to 
charities, the crusading chairman of the Little Hoover Commission. "That's the 
humane side of him, or the feeling that he owes it to society," the former 
employee said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Investigations 
</P>
<P>
Under Shapell's chairmanship since 1975, the Little Hoover Commission has 
conducted about 75 inquiries attacking mismanagement or waste in agencies 
ranging from local school districts to the state Department of Social Services. 
And last year Shapell Industries made charitable contributions of more than $1 
million, Mahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell, a Pole who changed his name from Natan Schapelski, has written 
"Witness to the Truth," a 1974 book about his experience as a prisoner at 
Auschwitz and as a postwar leader of Jewish Holocaust survivors in Munchberg. 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Shapell wrote that Webb and several others at Auschwitz saved his 
life. One day guards were calling out names and serial numbers of those in 
Shapell's unit to be transported from the camp, and he hid in the lavatory. 
Later, Webb and others bamboozled the guards so that they stopped looking for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"To my knowledge, I was the only one lucky enough to escape like this, and to 
all of those men I owe a debt," Shapell wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell, who was traveling and declined to be interviewed for this story, in 
many ways is a private man. Shapell Industries went public in 1969, but Shapell 
regretted it almost immediately, Mahan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEC, Stockholders 
</P>
<P>
Shapell disliked the restrictions of the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
the scrutiny of Wall Street brokerage firms and stockholders who wanted 
ever-rising quarterly earnings from a business that is inherently cyclical, 
Mahan said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the early 1980s when interest rates soared, Shapell Industries, like 
many developers, had a rough time. According to public documents, from 1981-83 
Shapell Industries lost $25 million while averaging annual sales of about $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 the family bought the company back in a leveraged buyout for $35 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell apparently believes in keeping control of his projects. In 1970 Shapell 
Industries expanded into Colorado and Illinois, but Shapell later abandoned 
those plans. "His feeling was, if you can't be on the site of the project 
within an hour by car or plane, it's too far away," Mahan said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushed Housing Bill 
</P>
<P>
Shapell's prominent role in state politics has not been without controversy. In 
1981, Shapell, as head of a governor's appointed affordable housing task force, 
pushed a state bill that would have allowed a new commission to override local 
zoning laws and create up to five new cities anywhere it wished. The measure 
was eventually vetoed by then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But some who worked to defeat the bill, including Thousand Oaks city officials 
and state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), contended that Shapell, a major 
contributor to state politicians, wanted the bill enacted because his plans to 
develop the MGM Ranch property near Thousand Oaks had been frustrated by local 
zoning laws and the new bill could have helped him build more homes there. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who opposed Shapell in the lobbying fight was Ventura County 
Supervisor Madge Schaefer, who was a Thousand Oaks councilwoman at the time. 
"When you're at war with Nathan, you know you're at war," Schaefer said. But 
she came out of the battle respecting him. Shapell "never lied to me," she 
said, while "there are some developers that are double-dealing and underhanded 
and sometimes down and dirty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Fee Dispute 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean everybody sees things his way. Shapell is involved in a 
dispute with several school districts in the Santa Clarita Valley over 
developer fees that cover the cost of building new schools. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires developers to pay $1.53 in school fees for every square foot 
of residential development. But Santa Clarita Valley voters in five school 
districts approved substantially higher fees in a 1987 referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The California Building Industry Assn. sued the districts, challenging the 
constitutionality of the higher fees, and the issue is still tied up in courts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some developers, such as Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., have 
voluntarily agreed to pay the higher, disputed school fees. But Shapell, who is 
developing a 3,000-home project in Canyon Country, is holding firm and paying 
only what is required by state law. And that has created some hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Schools 
</P>
<P>
"Shapell and all those others will build a house, make a profit and walk away 
and leave people in those homes with no schools," said Clyde Smyth, 
superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In a related battle, last year two Santa Clarita Valley school districts sued 
Los Angeles County and Shapell, seeking to force county officials to reject 
building projects unless schools can accommodate growth in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the same issues, such as schools and traffic, are likely to arise as 
Shapell's Porter Ranch proposal receives consideration by the city of Los 
Angeles, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many builders, Shapell keeps his attorneys busy. He or his company have 
been involved in about 75 lawsuits in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help sell his Porter Ranch idea to public officials, Shapell 
has hired some political talent. Paul Clarke, the political consultant and 
husband of former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler, is the proposal's public relations man. 
The project coordinator is Robert M. Wilkinson, who represented the area on the 
Los Angeles City Council from 1953 to 1956 and from 1967 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mall, Offices 
</P>
<P>
The proposal includes 2,195 single-family homes and 800 condominiums. The 
commercial area would include the regional shopping center and an office plaza 
with buildings up to 15 stories high. Project officials said they have received 
inquiries from Nordstrom and May Co. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development officials are quick to point out that their proposal 
calls for spending $40 million to $50 million in traffic improvements such as 
new streets and computerized signal lights. 
</P>
<P>
"Shapell is an honest man and he builds a hell of a house," said Davis. "But he 
is in a general professional group that is organized. They can kill anything 
that's going to be harmful to them. . . . They are heavy players, and they are 
very, very strong and they usually win."

MONEY MANAGER STILL PICKING UP THE POST-CRASH PIECES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market crash in October, 1987, was a nightmare for many investors. 
Unfortunately for David H. Menashe, an investor, money manager and publisher of 
an investment newsletter, the fright isn't quite over yet. 
</P>
<P>
During the crash, he watched $100,000 of his wealth evaporate. He also lost 
$60,000 of the $300,000 that three clients gave him to invest shortly before 
the crash. And although the market has regained all of the ground that it lost 
in the crash, many small investors still have the jitters, and that isn't good 
news for somebody like Menashe. 
</P>
<P>
His personal money-management business, Menashe said, is flat. "I haven't had 
any new clients since last year." 
</P>
<P>
And since the crash, more than half of the 1,200 people who had been buying his 
newsletter, Fund-line, have dropped their subscriptions. The annual 
subscription before the crash cost $97 and is now $127, so Menashe has lost 
about $67,000 a year in newsletter sales. 
</P>
<P>
Being tied to the market guarantees ups and downs for a small business like 
Menashe's, where he's the only employee. What does he do now? Be calm, wait 
until investors feel better about the market, then advertise heavily and hope 
new clients come knocking. 
</P>
<P>
Menashe has been offering market tips for 20 years and claims to have made 
enough correct calls to have carved out a rather wealthy living -- even if he 
is not a household name who's regularly quoted in the financial press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Desperate Yet 
</P>
<P>
Given his net worth, which he says is well into six figures, and given his age, 
67, Menashe isn't desperate to sign up new customers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I feel confident that the confidence is out there again, then I'll 
promote again. I'll do some advertising, some direct mail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Menashe, who raised chickens before he got into the stock-picking business, 
manages about $3 million in other people's money for investment mostly in 
mutual funds, and he collects a fee of 1.5% of his clients' assets at the end 
of the year. His newsletter focuses only on trying to pick winners among stock 
mutual funds, rather than individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Why? When Menashe started his business in 1968, mutual funds were a hot item 
with investors, who liked the idea of pooling their money to own a variety of 
stocks. But mutual funds can drop like any investment, and Menashe said he 
started the newsletter "with the idea that I would be smart enough to tell them 
when to get out and to warn them of the pitfalls." 
</P>
<P>
He contends that over the last 2 decades, an investor would have earned an 
average 16% total return on an investment each year from following his advice. 
"Which is not as good as I'd like," he said. "Some years I've gone 25%, 27%. 
Other years I've done less." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Average Track Record 
</P>
<P>
According to an impartial source, Menashe's forecasting track record appears 
only about average in recent years. The Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria, 
Va., which monitors the performance of newsletters' stock picks, said Menashe's 
Fundline gained 29.3% from the start of 1986 until the end of 1988. That left 
Fundline near the bottom among mutual-fund newsletters; 11 others did better, 
and four did worse. Among all 77 stock newsletters tracked by Hulbert, Fundline 
came in 31st. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Menashe's Fundline isn't the only investment newsletter whose 
following has dwindled in recent months. Norman G. Fosback, an oft-quoted Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., publisher of several newsletters, including one on mutual 
funds that has 175,000 subscribers, said "renewal rates for all mutual fund 
newsletters are down." 
</P>
<P>
"In our case, 65% used to renew, now it's about 40% or 50%," Fosback said. "The 
bottom line is there is very little interest in funds right now." 
</P>
<P>
Menashe, Fosback and other advisers often count on advertising to help bolster 
circulation. Menashe has advertised in Barron's, Money and other financial 
publications, and has used direct-mail ad campaigns. But advertising is costly 
-- it can account for half of Menashe's total expenses -- and these days not 
enough investors are responding to the ads to make the cost worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Menashe said that a year ago he spent $5,000 to send ads directly to 20,000 
people on a mailing list of current and past subscribers that he had collected 
over 2 decades. "The return was very poor," he said. He picked up fewer than 20 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Menashe's gross income from the newsletter and his money-management 
service was about $108,000. His costs that year were $12,800 for advertising, 
$8,500 for printing, $5,600 for postage and $1,100 in telephone charges. His 
pretax income was about $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, he did not advertise because he feared that new 
subscriptions would not cover the costs. Meanwhile, more subscribers dropped 
Menashe's newsletter, leaving him with much less income in 1988, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chicken Business 
</P>
<P>
Menashe was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., but that is as close as he ever got to Wall 
Street. When he was 10, his parents moved the family to Burbank, where his 
father started a chicken ranch. The younger Menashe, after flying several B-25 
bombing missions in the Pacific during World War II, then started his own 
chicken business, first in Sepulveda and then in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Although his chicken flock grew to 30,000 from 4,000, Menashe had some money in 
the stock market and decided in 1959 to become an investment adviser. But after 
4 years of "so-so success," he went back to chicken ranching for another 5 
years. 
</P>
<P>
By 1968, however, Menashe decided that the only way to make good money in 
chickens was to raise hundreds of thousands of chickens -- a growth plan he was 
unwilling to pursue. Menashe decided to give the stock market another try. 
</P>
<P>
With about $20,000, he opened an office in Woodland Hills and started 
publishing his newsletter. He later moved his office into his house. He based 
his recommendations on the market's "technical" trends. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, technical analysts believe that the stock market moves in 
repeating cycles and that money can be made if investors correctly buy or sell 
at certain points within those cycles. Technical analysts pay little heed to 
corporate profits or the economy's overall direction. 
</P>
<P>
Menashe insisted that technical market trends "will show up before the 
fundamental news will show up," so that "you know there's trouble up ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Menashe's newsletter typically is eight pages; the first two are filled with 
his advice, and the rest contain several technical charts and graphs, including 
some devoted to individual mutual funds. On the back page, Menashe lists the 
recent track record of 40 or so funds and tells readers which funds to buy, 
sell, hold or ignore. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best, Worst Calls 
</P>
<P>
Menashe said his best call came in January, 1973, when he urged subscribers to 
sell every mutual fund share they owned. Soon thereafter came the 1973-74 bear 
market. His worst call was in September, 1987, a month before the crash, when 
the market was dropping rather sharply from its record highs reached in August, 
1987. Menashe counseled his subscribers that "yes, there has been a correction, 
but no, it's not yet the beginning of a major bear market." 
</P>
<P>
Menashe urged his readers to be fully invested in stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Menashe has about half of his money in real estate partnerships and the 
other half in -- no surprise -- stock mutual funds. He won't diversify into 
bonds or gold. "That implies that you don't have confidence in what the 
market's going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And just what is the market going to do? Menashe said he thinks that the market 
will probably advance over the next few months. So far this year, the Dow Jones 
average of 30 industrials is up 7.5%, but he warns that this year could be a 
repeat of 1961, when stocks rose sharply for the first few months, then sagged 
during the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm generally confident, but I'm always looking out in case things change," he 
said.
