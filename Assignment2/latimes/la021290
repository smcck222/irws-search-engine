SMILES IMPRESS SOVIETS ON TOUR OF U.S. BASES

It was handshakes rather than hardware that made the biggest impression on a 
Soviet delegation visiting area military bases this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The high-level Soviet officials, whose tour of military bases included an 
aircraft demonstration at the Miramar Naval Air Station and combat 
demonstrations at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, said they were more taken by 
American friendliness and hospitality than by the exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I am especially impressed by the openness of the arrangements," said Valeriy 
N. Ochirov, deputy chairman of the defense and state security committee of the 
Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we came to the combined view, having seen all this, that we should look 
at each other not as target devices in the cabins of planes," Ochirov said 
through an interpreter. "The mountain of weaponry is already too high. We need 
to make it lower and bring people (from both nations) together." 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Anatoly A. Chizhov, also speaking through an interpreter, 
said, "I'm impressed by the technical aspects, but the most important thing was 
the attitude of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
"They were very friendly, and we have to believe that Americans are exactly 
like the Soviet people. That is not (just) pretty words but my sincere 
impression of the trip," Chizhov said. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the Soviet Union's leading legislative body will be touring U.S. 
military installations for two weeks as guests of the U.S. House and Senate 
armed services committees. Their visit, including the stop in San Diego on 
Saturday, is to reciprocate for a tour of Soviet military bases last year by 
U.S. congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation, made up of diplomats, a scientist, journalists, interpreters 
and others, began its tour on Thursday.

UC ASSISTANTS ARE HOPING TO FORM UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego graduate student John Sullivan shudders when people call him a 
teacher's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
"Teacher's assistant is really a misnomer," said Sullivan, who teaches 
undergraduate classes at the university while he pursues a doctorate in 
literature. "We're not listed in the program as teachers for the class, but 
we're the only teacher that undergraduates come in contact with while taking 
the class." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan and other graduate students who work for the University of California 
as teacher and research assistants are demanding to be recognized as employees. 
Long a source of cheap labor in the university's classrooms and laboratories, 
they now are taking steps to organize labor unions and demand higher pay, 
benefits and limits on class size. 
</P>
<P>
UC administrators say a union of graduate students would force the university 
system to hire more instructors or force senior faculty members to assume 
routine duties now assigned to assistants. That, they add, would mean higher 
fees and tuition. 
</P>
<P>
The university's position is that the assistants are students, not employees, 
and administrators succeeded in temporarily blocking any attempts to categorize 
them as UC employees. 
</P>
<P>
"They are employees because they are students. They wouldn't be working as 
teacher or research assistants if they weren't pursuing a graduate degree," 
said Mike Melman, director of labor relations at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The students contend -- and the university doesn't disagree -- that they are 
the backbone of the university's teaching and research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire UC system would shut down if we decided to walk off our jobs," 
Sullivan said. "There would be nobody around to teach underclassmen. We are 
exploited workers in a peonage system. It's time that the university recognized 
this and did something about our low pay and working conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Union organizer Mary Ann Massenburg agrees with Sullivan and is directing an 
effort by the United Auto Workers, District 65 to unionize about 20,000 
graduate students who work throughout the UC system. The UAW began organizing 
graduate students at Berkeley in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The labor movement since has made its way through the UC system to UCSD and the 
issue eventually is expected to be settled in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The students lost the first round with the state when the State Public 
Employees Relations Board sided with the university and ruled that teacher and 
research assistants are students, not employees, because their jobs are 
considered part of their education. 
</P>
<P>
The UAW is preparing an appeal to the state appellate court and continues to 
organize. District 65 is organizing at campuses in Davis, Santa Cruz, Irvine 
and San Diego. Local organizers said that efforts in Irvine and San Diego "are 
in the embryonic stage," while Santa Cruz, Davis and Berkeley are further 
along. The other campuses, including UCLA, are behind the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley recognized the Assn. of Graduate Student Employees (AGSE) in August as 
the representative of graduate student workers. However, UC officials stressed 
that they are not recognizing the association as a labor union and said they 
will not bargain with the group. This was contested by the association's 
officers, who said that recognition of the group gave them de facto bargaining 
status. 
</P>
<P>
UAW officials estimate there are about 3,500 graduate student assistants at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes the important role that graduate students play in a 
university's academic program. At UC Berkeley last year, graduate students 
taught about 38% of all undergraduate courses, and about 60% of all freshmen 
and sophomore students had graduate students for instructors, Jeanne Bergman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergman, who is pursuing a doctorate in cultural anthropology, has been a 
graduate student since 1982 and previously worked as a teacher and research 
assistant. She is an executive board member of the graduate students' 
association and said that problems faced by graduate students at Berkeley are 
typical of those faced by graduate students at other UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a variety of reasons, big and small, why we felt it was necessary to 
organize into a bargaining unit," Bergman said. "Exploitation was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Graduate students get paid for a 20-hour week, earning about $1,200 a month. 
But student instructors, research assistants and graders (who grade professors' 
test papers) commonly are required to work up to 35 hours a week, while getting 
paid for 20 hours, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the class that he teaches, Sullivan said he is also required to 
take two classes per quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if I only worked the 20 hours, that doesn't leave much time to devote to 
my studies," he said. "But the reality is that arranging a lesson plan and 
correcting papers takes up more than 20 hours per week and we should be 
compensated for that." 
</P>
<P>
He pays about $1,800 per year in fees and is paid only during the 10-month 
academic year. He lives in campus housing, paying $528 rent a month, and said 
that he also pays $1,200 a year in health insurance for his wife and two young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures obtained from the university, Sullivan estimated that 
there are about 1,500 working graduate students at UC San Diego. A UAW 
organizer came to San Diego last week to work with the student group, called 
the Graduate Students Assn. The group has registered with the university as a 
student organization, but has not been recognized as a representative of 
graduate students who are employed at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling by the state agency denying students employee status, 
Berkeley's decision to recognize the association there gave a boost to student 
groups struggling for recognition at other UC campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The members of that student group said that Berkeley agreed to recognize them 
in exchange for a guarantee that they would not call another strike of graduate 
students, like the one that disrupted the campus for two days in May. The 
strike was the first of its kind in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We had no obligation to even work with them in any manner," said Deborah 
Harrington, labor relations manager at Berkeley. "Because the case is under 
appeal, the university indicated a willingness to listen to their concerns but 
not to negotiate or bargain collectively with them." 
</P>
<P>
Graduate students at several UC schools said the May strike emphasized the main 
issues they want to negotiate with university officials: fee and tuition 
waivers and salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main demand is for fee and tuition waivers," Bergman said. "Fees and 
tuition are currently about $1,000 per semester. We get paid about $1,000 a 
month, that means we give up a month's salary for fees and tuition." 
</P>
<P>
The UC system has no policy on fee and tuition waivers, so benefits for the 
grad students are uneven from campus to campus. Some, including San Diego, 
grant their research assistants waivers, but not the teaching assistants; 
others, such as Berkeley, grant no waivers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bergman said, salaries paid to teacher assistants always were 
taxed, while research assistants' earnings were not taxed until 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"This was especially difficult for research assistants. When you add up the 
fees, tuition and taxes that are taken from us, you'll find that our earning 
power has regressed considerably in comparison to our pay increases," Bergman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Massenburg said that UAW studies have shown that many graduate students work 
for minimum wage after fees and tuition are deducted. 
</P>
<P>
Graduate students have won collective bargaining rights at the University of 
Michigan, Oregon University, Rutgers University in New Jersey, the University 
of Florida and the University of Wisconsin, Massenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Switkes,director of academic personnel for the UC system, agreed that 
salaries paid to graduate students could stand to be increased but are still 
"quite competitive with those offered at other institutions." 
</P>
<P>
According to Switkes, graduate students receive the same percentage pay 
increases given to the faculty. But graduate student salaries in the UC system 
are set through the use of a complicated process that involves a comparison of 
salaries paid to graduate students by other universities, she added. 
</P>
<P>
She said some campuses have offered graduate students waivers of their health 
insurance fees, which range from $300 to $500 per year, and wishes the campuses 
could waive all their fees. But even without those waivers, she said, the 
assistantships are a financial help to students, not an onus.

A VALENTINE'S DAY SALUTE TO THE MANY NAMES OF LOVE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS CONTRIBUTE TO A HOLIDAY DISPLAY AT 
JOHN BURROUGHS HIGH IN BURBANK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Love is a multilingual thing. 
</P>
<P>
That's what a Burbank school librarian learned when she started assembling an 
unusual Valentine's Day display that reflects the growing ethnic diversity on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Trapenberg, librarian at John Burroughs High School, persuaded students 
and staff members representing more than two dozen nations to contribute cards 
that say love in their native language. The cards, in languages as exotic as 
Norwegian, Amharic, Sri Lankan and Yiddish, became part of a holiday bulletin 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to do something with the word love because we have so many 
people here from all over the world," Trapenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The librarian said she could easily have found the foreign words by consulting 
friends or reference books. "But that's not the point," she said. "I preferred 
to go to the students. I think there's a feeling they're contributing. A lot of 
them are newcomers." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many of the nations represented on the Valentine's display do not 
celebrate the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The multicultural project was inspired by a television show rooted in 
middle-class American nostalgia. A few weeks ago, Trapenberg said, ABC's "The 
Wonder Years" visited the Burroughs library to film part of its Valentine's Day 
episode, slated to air Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The crew left behind some valentine cards, and Trapenberg used them to decorate 
a library bulletin board. She decided to add some pink index cards with love 
written in several languages. "We started out real simple," she said. "I 
thought we'd just do Spanish and French. But we got into so many conversations 
with students at lunch. We realized we had one from West Germany and some from 
Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
To gather additional "love cards," Trapenberg approached students from other 
nations in the library and sought contributions through a bulletin distributed 
to Burroughs teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Ari Mosisoglu, 16, provided cards showing the Armenian and Turkish words for 
love, which sound like sir and ashk. However, it was not love, but war between 
the Turks and his fellow Armenians that led Mosisoglu's family to relocate to 
the United States four years ago. "I like it better here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zsolt Varadi, 15, whose family arrived from Eastern Europe in 1976, provided 
the Hungarian word for love. After he relocated, his American classmates began 
calling him "Zsolt, the lightning bolt." 
</P>
<P>
"I got used to it," he said. "So it's cool now." 
</P>
<P>
Shereen Nocom, 18, whose family is Chinese, and Shino Miwa, 18, from Japan, 
both said the word for love in their languages might be written as ai in 
English. But they said the word is pronounced a bit differently in each 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988-89 school year Burroughs had 141 students with limited 
English-speaking ability, Assistant Principal Maryle Emmett said. An additional 
286 spoke fluent English at school but said another language was spoken at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Although the second language was often Spanish, some Burroughs students listed 
Croatian, Mandarin and Persian. Altogether, Burroughs has about 1,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
Trapenberg said some foreign-born students who speak different dialects within 
the same language have debated the spelling on the valentine cards representing 
their nation. 
</P>
<P>
Students being students, Trapenberg realized that even a love-inspired project 
was not totally risk-free. So she had students check one another's 
contributions and said she is reasonably sure no one slipped a foreign 
obscenity among the love cards. "I think I probably would have heard some 
giggles," she said.

SCHAEFER SHIFTS SUPPORT TO DEVELOPERS, CRITICS CHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE VENTURA SUPERVISOR, WHO IS SEEKING REELECTION, BEGAN AS A 
CONTROLLED-GROWTH ADVOCATE. BUT HALF HER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOW FROM DEVELOPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Madge Schaefer's earliest causes was fighting the now-popular Oaks Mall 
in Thousand Oaks, a grass-roots effort that failed but helped launch her 
political career and reputation as a tough advocate for controlled development. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades later, as the Ventura County supervisor embarks on a 
reelection campaign, public records show that well over half the money she 
raised in the past two years comes from the building and land-development 
industries -- contributions that critics say represent a straying from the 
ranks of her early allies. 
</P>
<P>
"I found Madge Schaefer pro-developer oriented," said John Baloff, a North 
Ranch resident and retired civil engineer for the city of Berkeley who last 
fall unsuccessfully opposed a shopping center in the unincorporated community 
of Oak Park. "She doesn't really care what the people say. She wouldn't 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer's campaign-contribution statements show she has received about $44,000 
since January, 1988, from land developers, real estate agents, contractors and 
their attorneys -- about 62% of the $71,000 she raised during that two-year 
period. She reports a current cash fund of about $38,500. 
</P>
<P>
As she announced her plans last week to seek a second term on the Board of 
Supervisors, the fiery Schaefer maintained that her integrity and environmental 
sympathies are intact -- as do a host of admirers who include Joseph Edmiston, 
administrator of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and Rorie Skei, the 
immediate past chairman of the conservancy's board. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll know when I'm on the take because I'll be dragging a chinchilla coat 
through the Safeway, baby, and the Rolls-Royce will be waiting outside," 
Schaefer declared in response to questions about her fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really offended by it -- that people think I'm for sale, and I'm not. 
Those who are leveling the criticism are the ones who haven't made any 
contributions of any kind. The only thing they've contributed is their 
criticism," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, some of her present critics were early supporters who were members of 
neighborhood groups and homeowner organizations that hoped to stem the 
seemingly inexorable tide of development spreading northward from Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very disappointed and betrayed," said one homeowner activist who asked 
to remain anonymous. When Schaefer was on the Thousand Oaks City Council, "she 
identified herself with environmentalists. Yet on the Board of Supervisors she 
has, to my way of thinking, proved otherwise. She's regarded among 
environmentalists here as a turncoat." 
</P>
<P>
But she also has staunch defenders in the environmentalist ranks, like Skei, 
who is also chairman of the board for the Conejo Open Space Conservation 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a very smart cookie, and I think her integrity is beyond reproach," Skei 
said. "I think she's very capable of taking money from developers and then 
saying, 'Sorry, no deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer has no competition for the county's second-district seat, which 
includes the eastern end of the county and portions along the coast as far 
north as Port Hueneme. Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo acknowledged last 
week that he was thinking of running against her in the Republican primary in 
June, but said he has yet to make up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The other Ventura County supervisor up for reelection this year, James 
Dougherty of Simi Valley, reports a cash fund of about $93,600, most of it left 
over from his 1986 campaign -- during which he also accepted a number of 
developers' contributions, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions from the building industry are nothing new in Southern 
California, and Schaefer's contributions are modest compared with politicians 
elsewhere. Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, for example, reported 
receiving in a recent three-year period more than $880,000 in contributions 
from the building industry, or 48% of the total $1.8 million he received during 
that period. 
</P>
<P>
But in Ventura County, once a primarily agricultural area that is urbanizing 
rapidly, Schaefer's apparent ease among high-power developers has provoked 
skepticism among critics and supporters alike. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer has hosted two fund-raisers in the past two years, and the locations 
she chose for the events raised eyebrows among some constituents. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, Schaefer had a fund-raiser at the Hidden Valley horse farm of 
developer David Murdock, whose luxury residential project at Lake Sherwood, 
southwest of Thousand Oaks, still requires a series of zoning and general plan 
amendments by the Board of Supervisors. Schaefer voted for approval of the 
project in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign reports show Schaefer paid more than $5,000 for the use of Murdock's 
farm, and she asserted last week that no aspect of the brunch and horse show 
was a gift from the developer. Nevertheless, detractors say the location was 
inappropriate since Murdock has business before the Board of Supervisors, and 
Schaefer has since been criticized as being too close to the developer and 
horse breeder. 
</P>
<P>
During the event, Murdock donated a pony to Schaefer's fund-raising effort. The 
horse is reported in Schaefer's campaign statements as a $500 in-kind donation. 
It was purchased during an auction for $4,000 by Michal Bowman, the wife of 
Westlake Village developer Joseph Bowman. Bowman, who owns Wilma Pacific Inc., 
also gave Schaefer $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
A fund-raiser last June was held at the Tower Club in Oxnard, whose owner, 
Martin Smith, was described by Schaefer as one of the biggest landowners in the 
county. Schaefer's campaign reports show that she paid nearly $3,000 for the 
club's use. 
</P>
<P>
Others who have contributed to the Friends of Madge Schaefer committee in the 
past two years are the Lang Ranch Co. ($490), First City Holdings Inc. 
($2,000), Courtly Homes ($1,110), Jordan Ranch developers Peter Kyros Jr. and 
Fredric Maas ($730), Pardee Construction ($240), the H.F. Ahmanson Co. 
($2,000), Shapell Industries ($1,000), David Murdock ($1,500), the Horizons 
Group ($1,500), and Laurence-Hovenier Inc. contractors ($2,500). 
</P>
<P>
R.P. Richards Inc., a Goleta contractor that has been hired for several major 
jobs for the county, gave Schaefer $6,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After a charity ball at Murdock's Lake Sherwood clubhouse last December, 
society coverage of the event in a Thousand Oaks newspaper included a 
photograph of a smiling Schaefer at Murdock's side. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not at my parties or the people's parties," Baloff said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"She's a smart, tough politician. But I have not found her to be able to talk 
to me about density, about zoning, about the environment. Her job is to 
determine what is best for the public and the developer. I find she does what 
is best for the developer." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston said he disagreed with Schaefer's support of Murdock's project, which 
he opposed not only because it involved extensive grading but also because it 
turned Lake Sherwood, once a popular public recreation spot, into a privately 
owned site for the exclusive use of area residents. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Edmiston made a $250 contribution to Schaefer's campaign committee last 
year and said that in general, "she has been a great help to us. . . . I'd say 
we were lucky to have someone like her in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Skei agreed, suggesting that Schaefer attracts criticism more for her acerbic 
style than her voting record. 
</P>
<P>
But a Westlake Village homeowners' representative said he and other residents 
at the eastern end of the county were deeply disappointed when Schaefer voted 
in favor of conducting a combined environmental impact report (EIR) for the 
proposed Jordan and Ahmanson ranch projects, instead of rejecting the proposals 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the two projects would add 3,000 homes, two golf courses and two 
commercial centers to an area of the county that is largely undeveloped and 
flanks Cheseboro State Park. They would also increase traffic and the burden on 
municipal services in nearby Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental studies are expected to be released this spring, and public 
hearings concerning their results should take place in the summer and fall, 
coinciding with Schaefer's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The EIR was approved by a 3-2 vote, and she was instrumental in getting the 
EIR approved. She took the initiative and argued for it. She seems to take more 
of a developer's and builder's side than she does the homeowners'," the 
Westlake Village resident said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer said last week that "anyone who makes up their mind before becoming 
thoroughly informed is performing a disservice." 
</P>
<P>
Edmiston agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't criticize someone for saying, 'Let's see what the environmental 
impacts are,' " Edmiston said. "I don't think there's a single politician who'd 
have a 100% voting record. You have to look at the overall situation."

ROHR WORKERS ACCEPT NEW 3-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the International Assn. of Machinists voted Sunday to accept a new 
three-year contract with Rohr Industries Inc., formally endorsing an agreement 
that averted a strike at Chula Vista-based aerospace manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
The contract increases wages and retirement benefits and improves health care, 
life insurance and pension benefits for the company's 2,900 Chula Vista workers 
and 1,600 Riverside workers, according to Jerry Broening, a Rohr spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which ended nine weeks of negotiations, also provides for 
one-time bonus payments in its second and third years. Broening said he was 
happy with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a stop in the negotiating process," he said. "There's always 
differences of opinion, but we were very pleased with the cooperative attitude 
taken by the union." 
</P>
<P>
Workers were scheduled to return to work beginning with the last shift late 
Sunday night, Broening said. A spokesman for the union could not be reached.

IMMIGRANTS' EVICTION MAY BE POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The future seemed gloomy for hundreds of migrant laborers when a fire raged 
through their encampment in San Diego's Rancho Penasquitos area in November. 
</P>
<P>
Besides destroying dozens of squatter dwellings, the blaze drew considerable 
attention to what is perhaps the county's largest concentration of migrant 
laborers. That notoriety, prompting city pressure for a cleanup, seemed a 
presage to eviction of the workers, who live illegally on private property. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, San Diego city officials say all sides are moving toward an 
interim solution that would allow migrants to remain on the land for the 
immediate future -- if basic health and safety standards are maintained. City 
authorities, the landowner and migrant advocates have discussed the camp's 
status in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got to recognize that kicking people out and just having them 
move into another area is not the solution," said Jack McGrory, assistant San 
Diego city manager. 
</P>
<P>
If evicted from the encampment, residents say they would relocate in another 
canyon, playing out a scenario that has occurred numerous times in northern San 
Diego County, where migrant camps have proliferated and a number have been 
razed. At the bustling Rancho Penasquitos camp, rebuilding and a massive 
cleanup continue. Residents are planning a ceremony to rename the area El 
Fenix, or the Phoenix, after the mythical bird that rose from ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is the beginning of a lot of good things for the people living 
there," said Gina Velazquez, a longtime volunteer with the fieldworker outreach 
program of nearby Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church, which has provided 
considerable assistance to camp residents. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they are working to ensure that health and safety standards 
are in force on the sprawling grounds, which actually include several camps 
spread over several dozen acres of rolling brush. Among other things, the city 
is requiring a steady supply of drinking water, portable toilets and a trash 
storage and removal system. Another requirement is that campfires be at least 
15 feet from dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about some minimal standards," said Michael Kemp, city deputy 
director of housing inspection. 
</P>
<P>
How the improvements will be implemented and financed remains uncertain, 
although camp residents have cleaned up the site considerably and indicated a 
willingness to do more. Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church representatives have also 
pledged assistance, as has the Rev. Rafael Martinez, who heads the 
Encinitas-based North County Chaplaincy, a migrant advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
Both city authorities and the landowners' representative now say that eviction 
of the migrants is unlikely in the near future. "I'm just going to let things 
lie and be quiet for a while," said Robert Scarcia, a Carlsbad resident who, 
along with his brother and brother-in-law, owns a 78-acre parcel that 
encompasses most of the encampment. However, they acknowledged that any 
agreement will be temporary. And workers will remain in substandard housing 
amid the suburban prosperity of North County. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate solution -- legal, permanent housing -- remains elusive, 
especially because little government money is available to build such 
structures. Area employers have expressed little interest in providing housing 
for their work force of migrants, who typically earn minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, there's a socioeconomic problem that has contributed to this 
situation, and I don't expect that it's going to go away that quickly," said 
McGrory, the assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
In North County, thousands of homeless immigrant laborers live without shelter 
in canyons and river bottoms. The workers, mostly Mexican men, are unable to 
afford area housing. The Rancho Penasquitos encampment, in McGonigle Canyon, 
just off Black Mountain Road, is one of the area's most expansive, if not its 
largest, such encampment. During peak seasons, as many as 500 people live 
there; most leave each morning in search of day labor, returning after work. 
</P>
<P>
While Scarcia, the landowner, indicated that migrants would likely remain on 
his property until the end of the year, he made it clear that the residents 
would eventually have to leave. He has posted "No Trespassing" signs. He also 
said that he would decline to sign any formal accord committing him to a lease 
or any agreement making him liable for mishaps or accidents on the property. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll cooperate with the city and the people as much as I can," said Scarcia, 
who city officials and even some migrant advocates have described as reasonable 
and patient. "We're all human beings. But I don't want to be taken advantage 
of."

FLAMES' SPECIAL TEAMS KEY WIN OVER RANGERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Calgary Flames' specialty teams were a little too special for the New York 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames' league-leading power play produced three goals in five chances and 
their penalty-killers added a short-handed goal as Calgary ended a three-game 
losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the New York Rangers on Sunday at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"The special teams were a big part of the win," Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said. 
"We did it both ways. The two power-play goals put us up early, and it's much 
easier to play in this building with a lead." 
</P>
<P>
The Flames are tied with Edmonton atop the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Al MacInnis, Joe Nieuwendyk and Joe Mullen connected on the power play for 
Calgary. Theoren Fleury added a shorthanded goal and the Flames stopped New 
York on six of seven power plays. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 7, Winnipeg 4 -- Petr Klima and Esa Tikkanen each scored twice as the 
Oilers overcame a 3-0 deficit and beat the Jets at Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Klima scored his goals in a four-goal outburst in the final period, with 
Tikkanen and Glenn Anderson also scoring as Edmonton overcame a 4-3 Winnipeg 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Mario Lemieux extended his near-record 
point-scoring streak to 46 games with his 44th goal and the Penguins beat the 
Flyers for a rare victory at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins won for only the eighth time in 70 games at the Spectrum (8-56-6). 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Buffalo 2 -- Brett Hull scored his 52nd goal and extended his 
scoring streak to a team-record 20 games as the Blues downed the Sabres at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Tuttle, Adam Oates and Dave Lowry also scored for St. Louis, 7-1-2 in the 
last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, Boston 2 -- Petri Skriko and Paul Reinhart scored 56 seconds apart 
in the second period and the Canucks beat the Bruins for their first victory at 
Boston Garden since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Cam Neeley scored his 40th and 41st goals for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 5, Minnesota 3 -- Dino Ciccarelli and Dale Hunter each had a goal 
and an assist apiece and Steve Leach set up two third-period goals as the 
Capitals defeated the North Stars at Landover, Md.

<P>
CRIMINAL TYPE STICKS TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of his career, Criminal Type has been the fraternizing type. To the 
detriment of his record and the consternation of his trainer, Criminal Type has 
preferred to pal around with other horses, rather than running past them in a 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The trainer, Wayne Lukas, says the horse has been "too social." One jockey 
after another -- including some of the best in the game -- has dismounted from 
Criminal Type and told Lukas that the horse had untapped ability. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers the hell out of you to hear that," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as a 5-year-old, Criminal Type may have changed his clubby ways. On 
Sunday, in the $325,500 San Antonio Handicap, Criminal Type caught the early 
speed and kept right on running. He scored a one-length victory before 33,960 
fans, giving him four consecutive wins, and in three weeks, for a supplementary 
fee of $20,000, he'll give Lukas one of his rare opportunities to win a Santa 
Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish Winner, a 6-year-old gelding who has won only one stake in the past 
three years, ran second at 34-1, finishing 6 1/2 lengths ahead of the next 
horse, Ruhlmann, the 2-1 second choice who paid the penalty for hooking up in a 
speed duel with Complicate. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron rode Ruhlmann, after having ridden Criminal Type to victory in 
the San Pasqual Handicap two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that horse's name ought to be Compromise," McCarron said of Complicate, 
who was 64-1, the longest price in the seven-horse field. "Because that's what 
he did, he compromised our chances. But there's nothing you can do about it, 
it's just something you have to face. When you try to restrain my horse, he 
just wants to go faster." 
</P>
<P>
Complicate finished sixth, 19 lengths behind Criminal Type. Present Value, who 
went off the even-money favorite, never did fire and finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, the meet's third leading rider, rode his first stakes winner of the 
season, following Lukas' instructions perfectly by patiently keeping Criminal 
Type in third place, several lengths behind Ruhlmann and Complicate, as the 
front-runners swallowed each other up down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
After early splits of :45 2/5 for a half-mile and 1:09 4/5 for six furlongs, 
the final time was an ordinary 1:49. Criminal Type, a son of Alydar and Klepto, 
a No Robbery mare, earned $190,500 for Calumet Farm, his breeder and owner, and 
paid $11.40 to win as the third betting choice. 
</P>
<P>
Complicate started fading into oblivion at the top of the stretch, but Ruhlmann 
took a little longer. Criminal Type took the lead in mid-stretch and held on 
comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I was ever on the horse," Solis said. "He took the lead 
and waited a little. But as soon as he heard the other horse (Stylish Winner) 
coming, he took off again." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type had had only 15 starts, with five wins and purses of $203,677, 
before the San Antonio. Calumet had sent him to Europe, where the horse 
suffered from nutritional problems, before he was turned over to Lukas two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he's legitimate now," Lukas said. "The extra distance shouldn't bother 
him. We'll try to scrape up $20,000 from one of those moldy (Calumet) trusts 
(for the Big 'Cap)." 
</P>
<P>
Lukas had nominated Steinlen, last year's national turf champion, for the Big 
'Cap, but he will keep that horse on grass. In three previous Big 'Caps, the 
best finish for a Lukas horse was a third by Life's Magic in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type carried 117 pounds Sunday, which was five pounds less than the 
top-weighted Ruhlmann. Payant, a stablemate of Ruhlmann's, was scratched by 
trainer Charlie Whittingham after he suffered a minor shoulder injury when he 
was kicked by another horse on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham wasn't happy about the rank outsider, Complicate, being at 
Ruhlmann's throat in the early going. 
</P>
<P>
"That set it up for the winner," Whittingham said. "I knew the other horse had 
speed, but I didn't think he'd chase us. It didn't help him, either. You saw 
where he finished." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron wanted to change Complicate's name to Compromise. Whittingham called 
Ruhlmann's nemesis by a less complimentary name. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Variety Road finished fourth in the San Antonio, under substitute jockey Pat 
Valenzuela, who got the mount when Santa Anita wouldn't let trainer Jerry 
Hollendorfer's first choice, Ron Hansen, ride. Hansen, the leading jockey in 
the Bay Area, has been banned by Golden Gate Fields for undisclosed reasons and 
is awaiting hearings in court and before the California Horse Racing Board. 
Santa Anita is also banning Hansen under an exclusion rule. "I can understand 
Santa Anita's position," Hollendorfer said. "But I wanted to give Ron the call 
on this horse, because he's been loyal to us and won some stakes races with 
him. Ron's a good rider and I don't want to prejudge him." . . . Variety Road, 
a 7-year-old, will now leave the track and spend another spring at stud, at 
owner Kjell Qvale's farm. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Anita has a rare Monday program scheduled today. Wayne Lukas has a chance 
to win his fifth stake of the meet, sending out Bright Candles in the Santa 
Ysabel. . . . Prince Dantan (1974) and Martial Law (1989) are supplementary 
starters who have won the Santa Anita Handicap. . . . "This colt is as good as 
any horse on the grounds, but now we have to get lucky and keep him sound," 
trainer Laz Barrera said about Mister Frisky, his San Vicente Breeders' Cup 
Stakes winner on Saturday. Barrera has paid a $2,000 late fee to make Mister 
Frisky eligible for the Santa Anita Derby on April 7. "I'll run him once before 
the Santa Anita Derby," Barrera said. "After the Santa Anita Derby, the plan is 
to send him to Louisville for the Kentucky Derby (May 5). The horse doesn't 
need any more than that much. He ran 13 times as a 2-year-old and the only 
breather he's had was the first month he was with me after leaving Puerto 
Rico."

INTO THE NIGHT: GRAPHICALLY ARTY DINNER, SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE SCENE: The annual Valentine's Gala for the Graphic Arts Council of the L.A. 
County Museum of Art. (It was held Friday night, presumably getting a jump on 
this year's Valentine activities.) The event, held at the Beverly Hills Hotel, 
honored one of the founders of Pop Art, contemporary artist Roy Lichtenstein. 
It was the second major event in one week for the museum, which opened its 
Helen Frankenthaler exhibit with a dress party last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
THE BUZZ: After dinner, the council held an auction of about 50 items ranging 
from artwork to vacations in London, San Francisco and the Napa Valley. Among 
the more unusual things on the auction block were an original Stephen Sprouse 
gown (Size 6), four hours of computer classes, a case of champagne magnums, two 
hours of private art appraisal and a "couch potato" package with 20 classic 
videotapes and a basket of gourmet food. 
</P>
<P>
WHO WAS THERE: Lichtenstein, wife Dorothy, and most of the Graphic Arts 
Council, including chairwoman Joni Weyl. Shirley Colby and Louise Epstein 
chaired the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
DRESS MODE: Black tie optional, emphasis on the black tie. In deference to 
Lichtenstein, many people wore graphically inspired ties and blouses: Stripes, 
polka dots, checks. 
</P>
<P>
CHOW: French onion soup, chicken piccata, angel hair pasta and strawberries 
with ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
NOTED: One of the items up for auction was a basketball in a plexiglass box. 
Although it appeared to be a sculpture by Jeff Koons, it was actually a ball 
autographed by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, which came with two tickets to an upcoming 
Lakers-Sonics game. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTED: Upon being congratulated on being the evening's honoree, Roy 
Lichtenstein smiled nervously and said: "The honoree? Really? Are you sure I'm 
not just the fall guy here?" 
</P>
<P>
TABLE TALK: While the quality of art drew mixed reviews from guests (none of 
whom, of course, wanted to be quoted by name), most of them were marking their 
bidding books for at least one item or two, and everyone agreed the estimated 
values in the catalogue were quite low. Others, such as Caroline Ahmanson, were 
preparing for next weekend's Music Center outing to David Murdock's new resort 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
TRIUMPHS: A catalogue of Lichtenstein works sold briskly, earning even more 
money for the museum. Also, chairwoman Weyl, a jazz fan, assembled a fine combo 
of musicians to provide dining and dancing music. The dance floor was kept busy 
all evening, even between courses. 
</P>
<P>
GLITCHES: Guests who left during the auction were puzzled by the favors piled 
by the door. There were black and white paper bags emblazoned with the museum's 
name and filled with red tissue paper and . . . nothing else. Serves people 
right for trying to leave early. KEVIN ALLMAN

CATAPULTED RIGHT INTO ANOTHER CZECH REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catapult by Vladimir Paral; translated by William Harkins (Cat Bird Press, 
$15.95; 226 pp). 
</P>
<P>
"Catapult," first published in Czechoslovakia in the Prague spring of 1968, 
sports, just in typographical terms, one of the worst and one of the best 
things that can happen to literature of this kind. 
</P>
<P>
The worst is one of those fiercely terrible introductions designed to make the 
novel seem "important" and "meaningful." It talks about "imagery that turns 
away from the humanized metaphor that animates the world about us to a 
dehumanized system of images that surround the novel's heroes with a whole 
world of bleak, disspiritualized material objects." (What is it about human 
nature that won't let a reader pick up a good novel and enjoy it, but feels the 
overpowering need to dose us first with sentences like that?) This introduction 
also compares "Catapult" with the Don Juan and Faust myths, and tells us that 
this sweet little narrative is a "parodic expose of Eastern European Socialism, 
of wasted economic potential. . . ." In short, the introduction does everything 
it can, in four dreary pages, to make you put the book down. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the publishers had a fortunate brainstorm when they listed 
the characters, with all their nicknames, a tiny description and phonetic 
transliteration of how to pronounce everyone's various monikers so you don't 
have to worry about keeping "Janicka," "Lenicka" and "Lenunka" straight. It is 
also suggested that this page be cut out and used as a book mark, and this 
device works perfectly. It's easy to keep characters sorted out and enjoy the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Czechoslovakia is on the road to reform, it seems that everybody and 
his brother was over there during the Prague spring. They've come out of 
American woodwork now with their Czech stories. 
</P>
<P>
Why should I be the exception? I was in Slovakia six weeks after the Russian 
invasion, saw the tanks, wore a Dubchek flag in my lapel and so on. I was also 
an adult in 1968 (was that the year after the Summer of Love or the year of 
it?), and based on this dual expertise, my reading of "Catapult" may be 
somewhat revisionist. 
</P>
<P>
Put another way, the trials that the Brno-based Cottex Corp., which seemed to 
manufacture nothing at all, were not all that different from the trials of the 
RAND Corp., in Santa Monica. All over the world that year, men were looking at 
their homes, their wives, their children, their errands, their parcels, their 
burdens, with a terrible disgust. All over the world (even in China, in a whole 
other way), men were saying, I hate my daily life, this laundry, this 
baby-talking kid of mine, this lump-wife I'm stuck with, there's got to be 
more! All over the world, regardless of race, creed, color, political 
affiliation, grown men were looking wistfully out windows and dreaming of the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
And so does Jacek Jost, married to Lenka, father to little Lenicka. Jacek is 
bored out of his wits, and when his train stops, catapulting him into the lap 
of a beautiful Nada, he is more than ready for an affair. In fact, he's ready 
for six more affairs, with six other ladies, and the six alternate lives that 
they bring along with him. In vain does Jacek try to get his wife to "discover" 
his flagrant infidelities. Her good heart and willful dullness foil him at 
every turn. Jacek brings home hairpins -- which his wife claims as her own. He 
tries to drive her seriously crazy by turning on the kitchen appliances when 
she's out of the room. It doesn't work. And his clumsy attempts at 
wife-swapping only make her cry. 
</P>
<P>
But another law of human nature is at work here: That which Jacek despises, 
other men envy onto madness. Lenka is not the dull little slice of meat loaf 
that her husband perceives her to be, and even as Jacek tries and tries to be 
rid of his wife once and for all (going through the apartment, mentally 
labeling things he will either take or leave, and if that's a Socialist trait, 
I guess we're all Socialists), other forces contrive to push him out of his 
safe domestic nest. 
</P>
<P>
"Catapult" would make a wonderful movie, a screwball comedy, descendant of the 
lovely, crazy Czech "Closely Watched Trains," or very distant cousins of the 
"Lavender Hill Mob." Just once, if you pick up this book, forget the weighty 
issues of the larger world. And remember that every hard-working husband over 
30 has at least once had a fantasy of turning his worthy wife in for a newer, 
sportier model.

'CARMELITES': A REVOLUTION AND REVELATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Poulenc's "Dialogues des Carmelites," which was completed in1957, isn't the 
most modern of operas. But the San Diego Opera, which undertook this fine 
Gallic challenge on Saturday, isn't the most adventurous of companies. 
</P>
<P>
One approached the Civic Theatre with a certain amount of trepidation. Would 
the psychological subtleties and spiritual complexities of the piece -- a 
fragile setting of Georges Bernanos' drama -- be conveyed with the proper 
concern for mood, idiom and historical perspective? Would the local audience -- 
usually happiest when confronted with cozy stage pictures, carefree plots and 
extrovert tenors -- respond to this bleak tragedy about the martyrdom of 16 
nuns in Compiegne during the French Revolution? 
</P>
<P>
Poulenc may not have been a violent avant-gardist. Still, one can't confuse him 
with Puccini. There are no gut-busting climaxes in this daunting dialogue, and 
no hit tunes. 
</P>
<P>
One needn't have worried. The San Diego Opera took Poulenc seriously on his own 
lofty terms. The attentive San Diegans -- unlike the sophisticated Angelenos 
who found Liszt's "Faust" symphony too much of a trial only last week -- seemed 
appropriately moved. 
</P>
<P>
The only debatable elements in the "Carmelites" production involved some of the 
theatrical decisions. Bliss Hebert, the seasoned director, introduced a 
self-conscious staging scheme that required the principals to perform their 
urgent maneuvers on a central ramp while the generally unaroused rabble 
observed the proceedings from bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
The motley rabble, not incidentally, milled about the curtainless stage, for no 
apparent purpose, before the opera began and during the intermissions. Anyone 
for "Les Miserables"? 
</P>
<P>
To facilitate rapid scene changes, costumed stage hands constantly moved props 
around the playing area. To define locales, prosaic illustrations were flashed 
on a screen that served as mini-cyclorama. Here, once again, we were subjected 
to the handicraft of Gunther Schneider-Siemssen. His picture-postcard designs 
were shared this time with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
John Dexter's celebrated production at the Metropolitan Opera in 1977 
demonstrated the superior power of grim abstraction. Nevertheless, the 
storybook version favored here did score Poulenc's basic points in an 
undeniably neat and functional fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Musically, the opera was in appreciative hands. Proving that there indeed is 
life beyond bel-canto accompaniment, Richard Bonynge maintained fluidity in 
orchestral textures, sustained cumulative tensions and supported the vocal 
exchanges sympathetically. His abiding finesse compensated for dynamic 
definitions that occasionally got blurred. 
</P>
<P>
The cast had been carefully selected and beautifully balanced. Nova Thomas 
conveyed the innocent pathos of Sister Blanche with tireless, radiant tone and 
expressive restraint. As the girlish Constance, Cheryl Parrish mustered the 
complementary virtues of uncloying sweetness and lyric purity. 
</P>
<P>
In what must be the most subdued assignment of an often flamboyant career, 
Carol Neblett brought dignity and spinto intensity to the noble utterances of 
Mme. Lidoine. Heather Begg as the deceptively stern Mother Marie enjoyed the 
advantage of brooding fervor, even when the rising line strained her 
open-throated mezzo-soprano. 
</P>
<P>
Most memorable of all, perhaps, was Maureen Forrester as old Mme. de Croissy. 
Although her once-lush contralto now resembles a thing of threads and patches, 
she focused the resources at her command with uncanny purpose. She turned the 
Prioress' death scene -- which lesser artists often use as an excuse for Grand 
Guignol indulgence -- into a riveting study of doubt that becomes terror in the 
process of self-revelation. She made every word tell, every inflection ring. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting players, all competent, tended toward the pallid. A mellifluous 
young tenor from Texas named Kip Wilborn attracted attention, however, as 
Blanche's brother, the Chevalier de la Force. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone in the non-French cast articulated the French text clearly 
but inelegantly. Under the circumstances, it might have been wiser to perform 
this essentially philosophical opera in English. If nothing else, that radical 
move would have allowed the public to pay more attention to the actors, and to 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, the conscientious supertitle-addicts had to devote most of 
their energies to reading the opera. Yet another crisis of faith . . .

'SEMIRAMIDE,' UNWISELY, UNWELL IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fools rush in where. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Oh, never mind. The good, ambitious, dedicated, hard-working, idealistic people 
who formed the Garden Grove Opera are not fools. But their introductory effort, 
an amateurish approximation of Rossini's seldom-performed "Semiramide," 
suggests that they might be a bit foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, not so long ago, when any operatic endeavor in blighted 
Southern California deserved instant respect. Those were the dark ages, before 
serious and reasonably equipped companies materialized in San Diego, Costa 
Mesa, Long Beach and even Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In those dismal days, one might have looked at the Garden Grove effort with 
indulgence, if not with admiration. One might have wanted to ignore the 
embarrassment of two eminently professional singers surrounded by an inadequate 
supporting cast. One might have tried to overlook risible stage direction and a 
scrappy mini-orchestra led by a conductor afflicted with a leaden beat. 
</P>
<P>
One might have wished to make excuses for a scraggly chorus planted at stage 
left where its members tried in vain to sight-read the score, leaving their 
theatrical duties to a bunch of eager mimes. This, after all, was an inventive 
case of mime over matter. 
</P>
<P>
All need not not have been lost. Under certain conditions, shoestring opera 
still can make sense. 
</P>
<P>
If Garden Grove had thought small, it might have had a chance of coming up at 
least with a small success. Unfortunately, the choice of "Semiramide" reflects 
elephantine thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Rossini's flawed masterpiece abounds in quaintly elaborate ancient-Babylonian 
rituals, ultra-ornate mock-dramatic trappings and, most crucial, massive 
bel-canto flights. The work exposes the weaknesses of even the grandest of 
grand opera companies. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny audience at the reasonably cavernous Don Wash Memorial Auditorium on 
Friday had to find whatever consolation it could, wherever it could. Rex 
Heuschkel's unit set, an all-purpose arrangement of steps, platforms and 
painted columns -- looked attractive and sometimes proved functional. Karon 
Poston-Sullivan brought silvery tone and easy top notes to the great bravura 
challenge of the title role. Gail Dubinbaum, though not in resplendent voice, 
mustered appropriate agility and depth for the heroic Hosenrolle, Arsace. 
</P>
<P>
James Sullivan conducted. Don Hayes served as stage director. The supporting 
cast included Paul Johnson, Richard Irving, Mel Whitehead, Steven Dunham, Nancy 
Bliss Estes and Stanley Jerman. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most intriguing contributions to the presentation came, not 
incidentally, in the form of a slip in the credit booklet announcing "programme 
corrections." 
</P>
<P>
The public was duly informed that "no disrespect is intended by James 
Sullivans' (sic) name being in 8 point Swiss Roman rather than 10 point Swiss 
Roman type. Opps (sic)." 
</P>
<P>
Dutiful confession: Your faithful scribe fled sadly into the night after an 
hour and 45 minutes. Sometimes enough is too much. 
</P>
<P>
Opps.

Wiesenthal in West Berlin Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal paid tribute Saturday to 
the actor who played him in a television film of his life story -- British 
actor Ben Kingsley. Wiesenthal, who was in West Berlin, also praised the 
American television production, entitled "The Murderers Among Us -- The Simon 
Wiesenthal Story," which starred Kingsley and won the Golden Camera award, one 
of West Germany's highest television honors. 
</P>
<P>
Wiesenthal appeared to be moved as Kingsley said that the real prize was for 
Wiesenthal and his work. Wiesenthal, now 81, was confined in 12 concentration 
camps and lost nearly all his relatives to the Holocaust. He was liberated by 
U.S. troops from the concentration camp Mauthausen in 1945, and has brought 
about 1,200 Nazi criminals to justice. CLAUDIA PUIG

Violence on Film Evaluated: The National Coalition on Television Violence, 
which computes the violence and assesses the pro- and antisocial thematic 
content in movies and TV shows, has picked its best and worst movies for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Romero," "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Dad" were rated the most pro-social 
pictures. Tom Cruise ("Born on the Fourth of July") and Sally Field ("Steel 
Magnolias") were cited for their work. The "most violent (and) socially 
destructive" films of 1989 were "Bloodfist," "Tango &amp; Cash" and "Friday the 
13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan." CLAUDIA PUIG

McCartney Helps the Homeless: Paul McCartney's concert to help the Bay Area 
homeless is doing that already for at least one homeless man -- weeks before 
the March 31 performance at UC Berkeley's Memorial Stadium. Janise Jordan, 
assistant manager of a local Wherehouse store, said about 20 people were lined 
up Saturday hoping to buy tickets, which went on sale Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
One of those in line, she said, was a homeless man who was paid $40 to save a 
space in line for someone else wanting to snare tickets, priced at $30 each. 
The city of Berkeley has been promised at least $100,000 of the proceeds to 
help the local homeless. The university is expected to receive a like amount.

STATION'S SUCCESS OR FAILURE HINGES ON NEWS ANCHORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
News anchors, television news experts will tell you, are the key to ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the reporters' looks, the sets' color and the opening graphics are 
important. Content makes a difference, too. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, though, the ability of anchor men and women to win 
over the audience, to earn their trust, is the essential ingredient to beating 
the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Anchors can be a reason not to watch a newscast," a local television executive 
said. "No matter how straight or honest, or how good a newscast is, if people 
don't like the anchors, they won't watch." 
</P>
<P>
Viewers seem to like anchors who display some journalistic skill, but it is not 
essential. Far more important is the anchor's ability to communicate -- in 
other words, that they speak clearly and forcefully and act like they can think 
and talk at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Stations love to portray their anchors as hard-working journalists, in the 
field, press card in fedora, seeking truth and justice. They know they're not 
fooling anybody. Yet it is imperative to build respect, to have the audience 
believe that news readers have a real idea of what is going on in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers tune in to anchors who make them feel warm and comfortable. After all, 
they're inviting these people into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, television news departments are entering an unusually stable period. 
Except for KGTV's (Channel 10) Michael Tuck, who is headed for Los Angeles, the 
anchors are set. 
</P>
<P>
The race is on. This month is a ratings sweep period, and beyond the sea of 
special reports and in-depth features, San Diego audiences will be passing 
judgment on the anchors. The team that woos the hearts and viewing habits of 
San Diegans stands to win big bucks for themselves, as well as their stations. 
</P>
<P>
The lineups: 
</P>
<P>
* KGTV (Channel 10): The current champions have been buoyed by one of the 
city's most consistent lineups. Viewers like consistency. Tuck is headed for 
Los Angeles, but the station has signed Kimberly Hunt to a new deal, and Carol 
LeBeau doesn't seem to be going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt and LeBeau are the glamour queens of local news. They dress for each 11 
p.m. newscast as if they just came from a high society cocktail party. 
</P>
<P>
LeBeau comes across like the stern aunt who always brings the kids a present, 
but makes them listen to a lecture about the evils of overeating as payment. 
Aunt Carol is a familiar face to San Diegans. That's a plus. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt is saddled with a blond baby-doll image, but her on-air demeanor is cool 
and formal. Certainly some tune in simply to see her hair style of the day. The 
station has been making efforts to portray her as a Serious Journalist, sending 
her out on more stories. 
</P>
<P>
* KFMB-TV (Channel 8): Allison Ross is long gone. Long live Susan Roesgen. At 
least that's what the station is hoping. The ratings slipped after Ross left 
last year, but it always takes viewers a while to grow accustomed to new faces. 
</P>
<P>
Roesgen is cool and reserved, moving dangerously close to being cold and 
distant. She blinks quite a bit, to the point of being unnerving. She seems 
offended by the banter of jokers Larry Mendte and Ted Leitner. Yet she has a 
certain alluring look. 
</P>
<P>
Sidekick Stan Miller is apparently her male equivalent. The pairing of two high 
sex-appeal anchors has to be more strategy than accident. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has a folksy, lets-sit-down-and-chew-the-fat style. He has an uncanny 
ability to look earnest one moment, jovial the next. He should be forbidden 
from making small talk on the air. Typical witty Miller ad lib: "Yeah, you can 
say that again." 
</P>
<P>
* KNSD-TV (Channel 39): The Marty and Denise Show is developing into a 
long-running act. For more than two years, Marty Levin and Denise Yamada have 
been the key anchors at the perennial third-place station. It has yet to be 
proven that large numbers of San Diegans will tune in to see the duo deliver 
the news "straight," despite a recent minor ratings increase at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Levin manages to project his no-nonsense personality on the air. Other than 
(perhaps) Tuck, he is the only local anchor who appears able to converse on 
local topics and sound intelligent. His skills are abundantly clear during 
special shows, such as election coverage or the monthly "Third Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Yamada has stopped giggling on the air. That's a plus. She seems to be 
straining to be a serious news reader. But, in general, she seems to have grown 
more comfortable in the co-anchor role. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line: Will San Diegans let Levin and Yamada into their homes? 
</P>
<P>
In a move that can be seen as a major coup in terms of exposing its newscast to 
more people, Channel 10 has reached an agreement with Cox and Southwestern 
cable systems to air short local news segments throughout the day on CNN's 
"Headline News" channel. The service is tentatively scheduled to begin in 
April. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Larry Himmel has signed to work on a pilot for Fox Television. On the show, 
described as an "updated Real People," Himmel will provide interviews and 
commentaries. It is scheduled to air on KTTV (Channel 11) in March. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KVSD-AM (1000), unable to make much of a dent in the news-talk competition, is 
switching its call letters to KCEO, pending FCC approval, and emphasizing a new 
business and financial news format. Perry Allen and Ron Fortner are out in the 
mornings. Stockbroker George Chamberlin, who left KVSD to go to XTRA-AM (690), 
only to be dumped a few months later, will return to handle the morning slot. 
Fortner has been hired by XTRA to be a general assignment anchor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Send a press release and they will come. There was no real news value in the 
opening of an Aventine Center health club last week. Sure, it seems to be a 
large and trendy place. And maybe that's why channels 8 and 10 did features on 
it, and the San Diego Tribune ran a big picture. Or maybe it was simply because 
they received a press release. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Recently deposed Channel 39 weatherman Dave Bender says the station didn't pick 
up the option on his contract last September. When he turned down their offer, 
he was told to pack his belongings. He wasn't that upset. He has a new agent, 
Conrad Shadlin -- who also handles Greg Hurst and Larry Mendte, among others -- 
and has already made contact with stations in Cleveland, Dallas and Los 
Angeles. He'd prefer Los Angeles, where he could pursue his real dream -- to 
someday be the host of a television game show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This Thursday's edition of Channel 39's "Third Thursday," focusing on the death 
penalty, is scheduled to include a live interview from Houston with Clarence 
Brandley, who was a few days from being executed when a court reversed his 
murder conviction. Also due to appear: Doris Tate, mother of actress Sharon 
Tate, who was murdered by the Manson clan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Channel 39 has picked up "A Current Affair," now airing on Channel 10, 
effective in September.

WATTS' EXPERIMENTAL TRIO HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't know what it is, but it's not jazz" were the words of caution firmly 
spoken by a member of the audience between sets Friday night at Le Cafe, where 
a drum-less trio fronted by saxophonist Ernie Watts began a two-night stint. 
</P>
<P>
The caution was overstated as Watts, pianist Peter Robinson and bassist Joel 
DiBartolo provided an impressive second set of original compositions that 
challenged the ear and stimulated the mind. True, the group did not present 
jazz from any of the traditional bags, but the concepts and improvisational 
spirit evidenced the players' familiarity with the territories of bop, blues 
and the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
The late-night set before a full house at the intimate Sherman Oaks nightery 
began with "Echoes," an attractive swing piece from Watts that recalled the 
influence of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley and other jazz saxophone 
greats. The piece, wide ranging in scope and style, provided an apt setting for 
Watts' inspired tenor sax melodies and established the trio's ability to create 
distinctive, propelling rhythm patterns without the aid of drums. 
</P>
<P>
Just as compelling and effective were several moments when an arrhythmic 
approach was taken, as in Robinson's beautifully wrought "Lullaby" and the 
following "Phoenix Rising," the former played without DiBartolo's bass. Both 
compositions featured stark, plaintive melodies that Watts, playing both tenor 
and soprano, and Robinson explored with deft musicality. 
</P>
<P>
DiBartolo's musicianship was extraordinary throughout the set, his walking 
lines providing rhythmic impetus and harmonic movement on such tunes as "On the 
Border," which featured a funk backdrop from Robinson, and "Blues in H," a 
note-laden piece that showed there is indeed room for humor in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The teaming of Watts, Robinson and DiBartolo is a good one. Lacking in pretense 
(as so many experimental groups are not), this trio successfully served 
inspired musicianship in an entertaining format. Who could ask for anything 
more?

PIANIST ALEXANDER SLOBODYANIK AT EL CAMINO COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's rueful. He's dour. Smiling to an audience hardly occurs to him. He's also 
startlingly handsome in a tall, gaunt sort of way. And when he sits 
picture-perfect at the piano -- as he did Friday at El Camino College -- with 
his flaxen hair caught by the overhead light and his lanky frame fitting itself 
to the instrument, he defines poetic elegance. 
</P>
<P>
Even if central casting had dreamed him up, Alexander Slobodyanik could not be 
better. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point: The Soviet pianist's image and art are one, as made evident 
in a program of familiar Chopin, Liszt, Mozart, Mendelssohn and Prokofiev. 
</P>
<P>
No blandishments marred his musical vision. Neither did sentimentality have a 
place. Pathos was set forth simply and drama took on a dark intensity, whether 
brooding or fiery. Prettiness of tone and sensuality of touch -- for their own 
sake -- were banished. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his prodigious technique could be put to whatever use he chose. In 
the Chopin group, for instance, Slobodyanik went straight to the harmonically 
difficult center, pulling out seldom heard voices. 
</P>
<P>
He reined in the glitter commonly found in the "Fantaisie-Impromptu" and 
thoroughly Scriabinized the third and fourth ballades -- the F-minor, for 
instance, came off as a darkly roaring epiphany. 
</P>
<P>
That so hackneyed a piece as Liszt's "La Campanella" could emerge sans 
showiness, reduced to a frenzied, nerve-wracked episode of mania, was a 
testament to the pianist's individuality. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, he knew how to roll back. The sad little waltz in the midst of 
Mozart's D-minor Fantasy was laid out with a placid perfection, eloquently 
bespeaking a world of sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
There were no encores after Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata. But the audience seemed 
satisfied to be sent out on the gust of this acerbic, dense, aggressive music 
-- played with brusque authority and the same breathless spontaneity noted 
before.DONNA PERLMUTTER

ISO DANCE THEATRE IN 'TIME OUT' AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Time Out," ISO Dance Theatre reassembles classic images from '80s dance in 
a quasi-nostalgic cavalcade. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the high-intensity spotlights and billowing smoke of Twyla Tharp's 
"Fait Accompli" and "In the Upper Room"? They're here. So are the whimsical 
body masks of Mummenschanz, the sculptural Expressionism of the revived 
Triadisches Ballett, the partnering innovations of La La La Human Steps, the 
canopy seascape of Pilobolus' "Day Two" -- plus gladiatorial-style sex warfare 
that might have come from nearly anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Instantly familiar at its North American premiere over the weekend in Royce 
Hall, UCLA, "Time Out" represents a kind of Zeitgeist cartoon, with ISO 
reworking other artists' visions for maximum accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes there's a sense of Walter Mittyesque fantasy to these borrowings, as 
when Jamey Hampton tries on the gauze discarded by a "Thriller"-style monster. 
Sometimes, ISO seems to comment on its sources, as when Daniel Ezralow moons 
the audience from behind the Pilobolus sea-canopy. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, the piece makes reference to Andrea De Carlo's original "Time 
Out" scenario, a 14-scene narrative about "an accidental journey in the fourth 
dimension." Thus time cycles are juxtaposed in a sequence where Ezralow is 
shadowed by dancers behind him -- their movements the same as his but dilated 
-- just as the undersea segments reflect De Carlo's notions of the surreal. 
</P>
<P>
A blaring, apocalyptic jazz score by Ludovico Einaudi and an elaborate 
production designed by Anita Evenepoel and Maria Blaisse complete the aura of 
upscale overkill: ISO as "I'm So Overproduced." What's missing is both an 
individual perspective on most of the '80s references and even minimal 
choreographic interest. 
</P>
<P>
Now featuring Sheila Lehner as well as its founders (Ezralow, Hampton, Ashley 
Roland and Morleigh Steinberg), ISO remains passionately devoted to displays of 
dance skill, theater technology and bare skin. But the movement ideas in "Time 
Out" stay so undeveloped that the piece has no momentum of its own -- it has to 
be continually forced forward by the hard labor of its cast. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the familiar "Night Thoughts" (on the same UCLA program) may be 
awfully grandiose in its religioso imagery -- angelic women hovering in the air 
(on wires) above suffering, earthbound men. But at least it has a spectacular 
finale in which the gang-of-four uses aerial harnesses to create a vision of 
dancing freed from any gravitational limits. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Ezralow-Hampton duet "Woomen" moves, as always, with the speed of 
thought though inspired manipulations of time, energy, gestural metaphor and 
special effects. If only "Time Out" were nostalgic for that kind of '80s dance 
experience. . . .

'HARD TO KILL': ACTION AT POINT-BLANK RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steven Seagal, the hero of "Hard to Kill" (citywide), is not just hard to kill. 
He's practically impossible to kill. Early on, hired assassins blaze away at 
him repeatedly from point-blank range. All it does is knock him into a coma for 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
When he wakes up, Seagal's "unstoppable" Storm Mason really hits his stride. 
Wave after wave of murderers stalk him, ambush him, surround him, blast him 
with automatic rifles, flail away at him with knives and hatchets -- all to 
little avail. Even lying flat on his back on a hospital cart, armed with 
nothing but a mop, he's more than a match for everybody. And, after he 
recovers, with the help of Kelly Le Brock and acupuncture, he's hell on wheels: 
ready to match antics with Stallone, Schwarzenegger and any other 
one-against-a-hundred Ubermensch in town. 
</P>
<P>
There's a plot to this ludicrous mayhem, but it's almost embarrassing to 
repeat. In it, Mason surreptitiously records a murder-for-hire discussion 
between a "flamboyant Los Angeles assemblyman" and Mafia killers. Then Mason 
makes a phone call to headquarters: a hideous mistake, since every phone call 
in the movie is constantly being intercepted by crooked cops or leering thugs 
-- and he winds up with his friend and wife dead, his son in hiding and himself 
comatose in the hospital, being ogled by nurse Le Brock. Meanwhile, the 
assemblyman, riding on his vacuous blond looks, inane slogans ("You can take 
that to the bank!") and hypocritical politics, rises inevitably toward the vice 
presidency: the only half-believable element in the script. 
</P>
<P>
But they made a mistake. They made Mason mad. What does it matter if he's 
battling a senator, corrupt police, dozens of surly thugs and the entire phone 
system? These guys don't know who they're messing with. Soon, they're dropping 
like flies: crashing through windows, tumbling over car hoods, blasted through 
piazzas, blowing up in cars, spinning head over heels in their own gore. 
</P>
<P>
Most one-against-a-hundred action movies are fairly reactionary, full of 
vigilante cops and lone avengers. Seagal's movies tend to be leftish, which 
makes for a fairly curious conclusion: at the climax, the senator is holed up 
just like a cocaine czar, with bikinied doxies and sneering torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
Seagal , a martial-arts expert, has lots of nifty chop-socky moves and a 
menacing murmur that sounds like Mickey Rourke doing Clint Eastwood. Le Brock 
looks great and manages her costume changes with dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
Director Bruce Malmuth keeps all the carnage in the frame, despite his 
addiction to sweaty close-ups and wet streets. Everyone else in the 
preposterous "Hard to Kill" (rated R, for sex, nudity, language and violence) 
dies right on schedule. There's nothing dopier than the crooks in 
one-against-a-hundred action movies -- except maybe the people who cook them 
up.

<P>
CALIFORNIA: HERE'S A CRIME TO BE OUTRAGED ABOUT. LOOK AT THE ENORMOUS AND 
GROWING WASTE OF STATE RESOURCES ON PRISONS AND PRISONERS, WHILE WE MAKE NO 
HEADWAY AGAINST THE CRIME RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCENT SCHIRALDI, Vincent Schiraldi is director of the National Center on 
Institutions and Alternatives in San Francisco and a member of the Blue Ribbon 
Commission on Inmate Population Management. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two big criminal-justice developments occurred during the last week of January. 
Charles Rothenberg, convicted of attempting to murder his son by setting him 
afire, was released from prison. California's Blue Ribbon Commission on Inmate 
Population Management, charged with devising ways to make the state's 
criminal-justice system saner, issued its report to the Legislature. Most 
readers, unfortunately, missed the latter story, and therein lies a reason why 
our views of justice issues are so distorted. 
</P>
<P>
Media and public preoccupation with the release of criminals like Rothenberg 
and rapist Larry Singleton, paroled in 1987, spoils our chances for rational 
criminal-justice decision-making. And judging by the commission's report, a 
rational and practical approach to crime and justice is exactly what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's report includes some astounding data on imprisonment in 
California. During the past 10 years, for example, the state's prison 
population has nearly tripled. The percentage of the state budget spent on 
adult and juvenile facilities has tripled as well. The result: The crime rate 
is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 172,000 inmates in state adult and juvenile facilities and 
in local jails. If the status quo is maintained, that number will soar to 
250,000 by 1994. The budget for the Department of Corrections alone will be $4 
billion, up from $300 million a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of financing the construction of every $50,000 minimum-security cell 
is another $50,000 in interest over 20 years. Operating expenses per cell over 
the same interval is $300,000. The price tags for each medium- and 
maximum-security cell are higher. The source for all this money is the state's 
general fund. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Inmate Population Management also found that California leads 
the nation in some dubious-distinction categories. The state is in the midst of 
what one legislator called "the largest prison construction program ever 
attempted by any governmental entity." It has the most overcrowded correctional 
system in the country -- at 173% of capacity -- with 83,779 prisoners jammed 
into prisons designed to house 48,391. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most shocking statistic was the number of inmates sent back to 
prison, not by the courts, but by the parole board. Last year, the total number 
of these technical violators -- mostly on drug-abuse grounds -- in 49 states 
was 19,000. By contrast, California re-imprisoned 34,000 -- at a cost of $204 
million. 
</P>
<P>
While California has rushed to improve its ability to punish convicts, it has 
dramatically scaled back its rehabilitation programs. Parole failure rates 
nearly doubled during the past 10 years. Treatment programs disappeared nearly 
as fast as drug abusers in need of them signed up. The percentage increase in 
youth and adult corrections funding is nearly double that of either education 
or health and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens and elected officials should be morally outraged over the offenses of 
a Rothenberg and a Singleton. But when politicians pander to fear and hate to 
build their careers, at great cost and questionable benefit to the state, we 
should be no less outraged. The media's chase of the easiest and most 
sensational crime story is certainly no help -- especially when we need to "get 
smart" and not just "tough" on crime.

CRIME: LATINO LEADERS HAVE JUMPED ON THE LAW-AND-ORDER BANDWAGON EVEN THOUGH 
THAT MEANS SENDING MORE AND MORE OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE TO JAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODOLFO ACUNA, Rodolfo Acuna is a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latinos should take a long, hard look at the so-called "Decade of the Hispanic" 
-- the 1980s -- to assess the consequences of their me-too attitude toward law 
and order. Most Latino politicians have bought the idea that urban decay can be 
solved by passing tougher laws and building more and bigger prisons. How else 
to explain their silence when the drug war disproportionately targets young 
Latinos, or their failure to question the need for more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
A consequence of this get-along attitude toward crime, as set forth in 
"Choosing Democracy," a book by Duane Campbell, is that today's entering Latino 
kindergartner is as likely to go to jail as meet the admissions standards of 
the state's universities. 
</P>
<P>
Latino politicos are understandably concerned about rising crime rates in their 
districts. Their law-abiding constituency is fearful and demands action. But 
that's no reason for them to abandon rationality by placing their faith in a 
policy of rounding 'em up and throwing 'em into jail. A large number of those 
rounded up and thrown into jail are also members of their constituency. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, adults and juveniles in California prisons and local jails, 
given present trends, may exceed 300,000, not quite double the current number 
of 172,000. Chances are good that 50% of the new inmates will be Latino, for 
several reasons: Most Latinos live in poverty and the Latino population is 
relatively young -- two factors associated with crime; they lack economic 
opportunity and are victims of selective law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Economically, Latinos are worse off today than they were 30 years ago. 
According to the 1980 Census, the earning power of a typical Latino family in 
California was less than 70% of its white counterpart, down from 79% in 1960. 
Latino poverty has also markedly increased. 
</P>
<P>
As in Latin American countries, poor Latinos in the United States are growing 
more dependent on an underground economy, largely fueled here by the illicit 
drug trade. If current arrest and conviction trends continue, families who do 
not have an ex-con relation will be rare indeed. 
</P>
<P>
This poses troubling consequences for the moral authority of Latino parents. 
When a close family member -- a son or daughter -- is arrested for drug abuse 
or dealing, parents naturally are less judgmental than if the neighbor's child 
is taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
But this attitude, however commendable, weakens their moral clout. When an 
entire community is similarly afflicted, its capacity to exercise social 
control is severely strained, if not moot. Outlaws are glorified as social 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on incarceration to correct this situation is clearly misguided. Prison 
life will not build Latino character. It reinforces gang identification and 
encourages the growth of its associated underground subculture. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Latinos more closely fit President Ronald Reagan's stereotype of 
the all-American family -- hard-working, religious, extended -- than do whites. 
Latinos, as a group, are more likely to have a job than any other, including 
whites, according to the 1980 Census. They are poor, to be sure, but not 
because they don't work. They just don't get paid decent wages. 
</P>
<P>
Latino politicians have failed to capitalize on this important fact about their 
constituents. One reason is the political mind-set born during the "Decade of 
the Hispanic": Fearful of offending anyone, Latinos strove to be gentlemanly 
about Latino problems; none dared call anything racist. Today, this attitude 
plays right into the hands of the law-and-order crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem of crime cannot be solved so long as we place the burden of 
saying "no" on a poor teen-ager who sells crack so he and his family can 
participate in the "good life." For Latino politicians to believe otherwise is 
a measure of how far they have strayed from addressing the needs of their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, this problem cannot be corrected by declaring expensive 
wars at home or abroad. The jail quick-fix only works in John Wayne movies. In 
reality, it feeds crime and its acceptance, and will ultimately bankrupt 
California. When the state spends $3,900 a year to educate a child and roughly 
$30,000 a year to keep an adult behind bars, something is out of whack.

FISH COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "Commission Should Go Fishing" (Jan. 27) suggests that the 
Legislature should abolish the state Fish and Game Commission and assign all 
fish and wildlife decisions to Fish and Game Department administrators who will 
"make decisions based primarily on scientific evidence and environmental good 
sense." The naivete of your position overwhelms. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for those of us who have worked with both agencies for many years, let 
me say that the good old American system of checks and balances -- in this case 
between administrators and policy-makers -- is crucial. Each agency has its 
strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the Fish and Game Commission can be improved in structure and 
operation. But abolish it? Dumb. Very dumb.

GIVING HATE CRIMES DUE NOTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government collects voluminous statistics on an abundance of 
activities. Is there any need to extend that list by adding to it information 
on the specific incidence of hate crimes? There is, because hate crimes are 
indications of a social pathology that represents a clear and present danger to 
public safety and welfare. Hate crimes seem to be on the rise, but no one knows 
for sure because no comprehensive collection of data takes place. That will 
soon be remedied. Both houses of Congress have now passed the Hate Crimes 
Statistics Act. The measure has President Bush's support. Soon it should be 
possible to get a clear understanding of just how widespread hate-related 
incidents are. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill approved by the Senate last week -- the House passed a similar 
version last June -- the attorney general would be required to keep statistics 
on crimes motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. Among 
the crimes to be counted are murder, assault, arson, robbery, theft, threats 
and vandalism. Reports on these crimes can easily be gathered by the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation as part of its regular Uniform Crime Report survey of 
nearly 16,000 law enforcement agencies. The bill has been strongly backed by 
civil rights, ethnic and law enforcement organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Hate crimes, the Justice Department noted in a 1988 report, "are far more 
serious than comparable crimes that do not involve prejudice because they are 
intended to intimidate an entire group." That point -- that hate crimes have a 
multiplier effect, with a single incident capable of affecting many people -- 
is of supreme importance. Are hate crimes on the rise, and if so, what patterns 
can be discerned, what groups in society might be most at risk? Before long, 
thanks to this necessary legislation, law enforcement officials and the public 
should begin to get some credible answers.

<P>
All hail our many-faceted President for his sound sense of proportion.

<P>
Our "education President" has allocated for Head Start programs, one-half as 
much as for rebuilding the parts of Panama he destroyed as a Christmas gift to 
the poor of that country (Part A, Feb. 1).

<P>
Our "environment President" has decided that twice that amount should "do it"

Our "support repressive governments as long as they aren't communist" President

homeless, the fixed-income aged, and the uninsured ill can wait at least until 
the next State of the Union message, to hope for a little of the largess our

GOVERNOR'S HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days the amount and quality of health care an individual receives depends 
on his monetary worth. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's health insurance plan, which will theoretically cover 4 of the 5 
million currently not covered, implicitly embraces a new model -- that health 
care is a fundamental right -- not just for the lucky ones in the mainstream, 
but for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The plan divides responsibility proportionally among government, employer and 
employee. If we're willing to work at it this could be a giant step towards 
health care for all.

GOOD ETHICS MAKES GOOD POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There may not be any second acts in American lives, but occasionally you do get 
one in politics. Tuesday morning, for instance, the curtain will go up on a new 
installment in a drama called the City of Los Angeles Ethics Act. That's when 
the City Council will reconsider its sorry vote of a few weeks ago to strip the 
proposal of its public- financing provisions and gut much of what remained. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict in this dramatic episode is between the public interest -- in the 
form of enforceable new ethics laws, affordable public financing of campaigns 
and reasonable pay for city officials -- and the council majority's 
self-interest, which reflexively resists reform. In the first act, to put the 
matter bluntly, self-interest triumphed. Now, the best way to restore the 
public's battered confidence in the basic integrity of its local government is 
to have the council itself set Los Angeles' ethical house in order. 
</P>
<P>
The council will have a chance on Tuesday to reconsider measures that will do 
just that: The first two -- the proposals for clear new conflict-of-interest 
and disclosure statutes enforced by an independent ethics commission, and for 
partial public financing of campaigns -- originated with a committee of 
distinguished private citizens appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley. The third -- the 
proposal to increase council members' pay from $61,522 to $80,000 by linking it 
to the salaries of municipal judges -- originated with the lawmakers 
themselves. In the original form, all three are meritorious. How the council 
now chooses to combine these proposals in the charter amendments that must be 
placed before the voters should not be decisive for anyone with a serious 
interest in equitable, effective city government. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles needs clear, commonsensical ethics, financial 
disclosure and conflict-of-interest laws, and an independent body to enforce 
them, as the citizens' commission originally proposed them. It needs what 
cities like New York and Seattle already have: affordable public campaign 
finance, which will reduce the pressure on elected officials to accommodate 
themselves to special interests. It needs to pay its public officials a salary 
at least roughly commensurate with their arduous responsibilities. It needs to 
secure these things not only for its own sake but also because cities 
throughout California are looking to the state's largest city for leadership on 
these issues. 
</P>
<P>
None of these steps will create a political Eden from which the serpent of 
corruption is forever banished. There is, after all, no perfection this side of 
the grave. But enactment of the commission's initial proposals on ethics and 
public finance, along with equitable pay for public officials, will go a long 
way toward reassuring reasonable people that their city government is honestly 
doing the best it can.

SOCKERS' LATE COMEBACK NOT ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK McDERMOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
RICHFIELD, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trailing, 4-0, with just 10:19 remaining in regulation play, the Sockers came 
up with their best clutch performance of the season before dropping a 5-4 
double-overtime decision Sunday afternoon to the Cleveland Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never over until it's over," said victorious Crunch Player-Coach Kai 
Haaskivi, who watched from the bench as his team struggled to come up with the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, at the Richfield Coliseum in front of 4,335 fans, was the Sockers 
12th in 15 road games this season. It snapped a four-game winning streak 
against the expansion Crunch. Two of the Sockers three road victories came 
against the Crunch. The third was against the expansion St. Louis Storm. 
</P>
<P>
After building a 4-0 lead against the Sockers, with just 10:19 remaining in 
regulation play, the Crunch was forced into double overtime before team captain 
Mike Sweeney sent the Sockers packing with a power-play goal just 1:54 into the 
second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney, who had crossed from the left of the Sockers' goal to the corner of 
the Sockers' penalty area, took a pass from teammate Pato Margetic and then 
took three steps toward the middle line before firing a shot from straight on 
past goalie Zoltan Toth. 
</P>
<P>
While Sweeney was the building's happiest occupant after the team's victory lap 
around the Coliseum carpet, the most unhappy was Sockers' Coach Ron Newman, who 
was trying to find justification for a two-minute tripping penalty handed 
defender Branko Segota by referee Casey Frankewicz with just one second 
remaining in the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
After the contest ended, Newman charged onto the field and ran up to 
Frankewicz, grabbing his hand and shaking it. "It was bloody - - - - - - - -," 
Newman said, of the call which gave the Crunch a man-advantage in the second 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I shook his hand and said to him, 'Congratulations on your win.' The man 
totally forgot the main rule of calling a penalty as opposed to just a simple 
foul -- a player's intent. That was the worst time he could have made a call 
like that. If he wants to call it a foul, fine. But pulling a card with just 
one second left is bloody B.S." 
</P>
<P>
The Crunch jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first half, with defender Bernie 
James scoring at 3:49 of the first quarter, with a shot from 15-feet out. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney then added a goal at 6:44 of the opening quarter, with a 15-footer 
straight on off a pass from Michael King. 
</P>
<P>
The Crunch then scored again at 5:54 of the third quarter, with Hector Marinaro 
bouncing the ball off Toth and into the net from five-feet away. Michael King 
then scored his 30th goal of the season with 4:41 gone in the fourth quarter, 
giving the Crunch a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The next 10 minutes will remain in the mind of Haaskivi for a long time, as the 
Sockers scored four goals over a 5:25 period to tie the score at 4-4, sending 
the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Thien Nguyen got it started with his first goal of the season, at 
6:13 of the fourth quarter. Cacho then followed with the Sockers' second goal 
at 9:45, followed by Steve Zungul's third goal of the season, at 10:40. Then 
came Zoran Karic's game-tieing effort from 10-feet out to the left of Crunch 
goalie P.J. Johns, which deflected off Johns with just 3:17 remaining in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught looking," Haaskivi admitted. "They're a great team and great 
teams never quit. I saw my worst nightmare happening right before my eyes and I 
felt a little helpless. 
</P>
<P>
"But I couldn't be prouder of the way we responded in the overtime. We sucked 
it up and went out and played determined soccer at a time we needed a total 
team effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say we were exactly thrilled with a few calls ourselves. When Zungul 
scored their third goal, they had seven players on the field and didn't get 
caught. We argued with the officials, but nothing was changed."

KASTOR TAKES HIS SHOW ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Vaughan Kastor of West Hills, Sunday's fifth Heart Run was little more than 
a workout. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all just training for track, sideline stuff for me," said Kastor, a 
former NCAA Division II track All-American at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, then watch out when Kastor gets serious. Because for practice, 
he outdistanced a field of more than 600 starters to win the five-kilometer 
race in 16 minutes 2 seconds. John Quinn was second in 16:21. 
</P>
<P>
Candice Kutrosky, 21, clocked 19:01 to handily win the women's 5K competition 
over Chantal Plante (19:35). In the 10K, Kim Gallagher, a silver medalist at 
800 meters in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, won the women's division in 37:55 
over Shirley Geerling (38:05). Richard Shelley, 28, won the men's 10K in 31:41, 
19 seconds ahead of Tommy Leon, 23. 
</P>
<P>
Though Kastor, 23, says road racing is not his forte, his track credentials at 
Northridge and Chaminade High reflect his big-race experiences. A 1988 CSUN 
graduate, Kastor ran 1:49.21 to finish third in the NCAA Division II 800-meter 
final. 
</P>
<P>
In his senior track season at Chaminade, Kastor won the Southern Section 1-A 
Division 800 title and he's run a personal best of 1:48.47. But this spring 
he's planning to step up to the 1,500 meters, which is why he found himself in 
Woodland Hills on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"(Right now), I'm about as comfortable in the 1,500 as I am in these 5Ks, so I 
have to teach myself how to run (the 1,500)," he said. Winning, however, was 
not a serious consideration until Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw (Buster Douglas) beat Tyson last night, that showed me that 
anything is possible," said Kastor, who passed the first two miles in 4:52 and 
4:50. "That even I can get up and run with the big boys." 
</P>
<P>
Race officials said 1,619 runners finished the two races, but an estimated 
3,000 people, most unofficial entrants, ran the pavement course, which started 
on Owensmouth Avenue adjacent to the Warner Center and finished at the 
intersection of Owensmouth and Oxnard Street.

CAL LUTHERAN HITTERS GANG UP ON CS NORTHRIDGE, 18-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Hitting," Cal Lutheran baseball Coach Rich Hill said, "is contagious." 
</P>
<P>
If that's true, then CLU has apparently been hit by a plague of epidemic 
proportion because Sunday the Kingsmen battered Cal State Northridge, 18-3, in 
a nonconference baseball game at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
That outbreak comes on the heels of a 23-1 season-opening win over Whittier. In 
two games, CLU has scored 41 runs and collected 34 hits, not bad for a team 
that finished last in the seven-team NAIA District 3 in hitting last season. 
</P>
<P>
CLU (2-0) did most of its damage Sunday in a 12-run fifth inning, sending 16 
men to the plate. Eight of them got hits, including Leonard Matsumoto, who hit 
the first pitch of the inning for a home run. 
</P>
<P>
Matsumoto finished with two home runs, two walks and four runs scored before 
leaving in the eighth inning. Peter Washington, a junior transfer from College 
of the Canyons, also had a big day with two doubles and a single in five trips. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen started quickly when Dave Leonhardt, the second batter of the 
game, lofted a home run to the opposite field off CSUN starter Monte Jones 
(0-1). Three walks and a double later, Jones was lifted in favor of Eric 
Spellman, who yielding a run-scoring single before ending the inning with CLU 
ahead, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
After the 12-run fifth, the Kingsmen scored twice more in the sixth, then 
cleared their bench. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN (3-4), held to seven hits by four CLU pitchers, scored single runs in the 
third, sixth and seventh innings, the middle score coming on a Scott Sharts 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
CLU starter Craig Anderson (1-0) got the win.

MOSCOW OFFER: ALL FORCES OUT OF CENTRAL EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union, declaring the Cold War over, on Sunday stated its readiness 
to withdraw all of its troops from Central Europe, many of them unilaterally, 
in an effort to accelerate the negotiations now under way on reducing 
conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In a formal government statement, the Soviet Union said that it expects to 
conclude agreements shortly with Czechoslovakia and Hungary on the withdrawal 
of its troops from those countries, that it is willing to reach a similar 
agreement with Poland and that it wants to speed up its pullout from East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow, expressing the hope that it could withdraw all of its 555,000 troops 
from Europe within five years, called for the bolder moves at the negotiations 
in Vienna between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact on 
military cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the growing rapprochement between East and West and attempting to speed 
the pace of negotiations to match, the Kremlin urged other countries "not to 
miss this historic chance and to supplement political detente by the relaxation 
of tensions in the military field." 
</P>
<P>
In declaring its readiness to withdraw all its forces from Central Europe, the 
Soviet Union again sought to set the political and moral priorities in 
negotiations with the West and to overtake the recent proposal by President 
Bush that Moscow and Washington reduce their force levels in Central Europe to 
195,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
That figure is too high for Moscow to accept as a ceiling, Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III was told during his discussions with President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev here last week, and the Soviet Union is more determined than ever to 
promote broad disarmament in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow accepted Bush's 195,000 limit if more than 30,000 American troops in 
England, Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey are included and if negotiations are 
scheduled to reduce the overall number. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cold War period has ended," the Soviet Union said in its statement, "and a 
transition to a qualitatively new international order based on fundamentally 
different relationships among European states has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in the post-war period, a realistic possibility has arisen 
for the gradual dismantling of the outdated model of the European balance of 
forces that took shape over the Cold War years and was based primarily on 
military confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, a new system of relations is to be established to ensure stability 
and security on the European Continent." 
</P>
<P>
With the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe in the past six months and the more 
gradual improvement in relations between East and West, the Soviet Union is 
increasingly apprehensive that a failure to match political detente with 
military cutbacks could undermine the whole process. 
</P>
<P>
"This task (of disarmament) becomes increasingly urgent, and there are good 
prerequisites for accomplishing it," the government statement said. "Successful 
headway at the Vienna talks on reductions in conventional armed forces . . . is 
one of the main prerequisites. At the same time, there are misgivings that the 
results of the Vienna talks may lag behind the pace of reforms in Europe. This 
should not be allowed to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet fear, quite plainly, is that most of its forces will already have 
returned home by the time the negotiators in Vienna have worked out an 
agreement covering their withdrawal and that there will be a consequent pause 
while the United States and NATO catch up in pullouts. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna negotiations are expected to produce a first agreement this autumn 
on reduction of armed forces in Europe. Diplomats are now discussing a possible 
summit meeting, favored by both the United States and the Soviet Union, to sign 
the agreement and lay the basis for further talks. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's initiative on Sunday, going significantly beyond its previous calls 
for arms reduction, was the first to recognize the impact on arms control of 
the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe, where one Communist regime after 
another has been forced out, and to acknowledge that the often breathtaking 
speed of the changes has left the diplomats far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow said it expects to conclude agreements, which are already under 
negotiation, with Czechoslovakia to withdraw its 70,000 troops there and with 
Hungary to pull out its 65,000 troops there this year, probably before the end 
of summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union said it is also prepared for similar talks with Poland, where 
40,000 Soviet troops are based. 
</P>
<P>
"There are all grounds to expect that these talks will end in agreement on all 
aspects of troop withdrawal, including the technical and social matters, and 
that Soviet soldiers and officers will be able to return home as quickly as 
possible," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet troops in East Germany, estimated to number 380,000, are in a 
different category, Moscow said, and their reduction -- beyond important 
unilateral cutbacks already under way -- must be negotiated in Vienna, perhaps 
in terms of the probable reunification of East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moscow was initially pushed hard to meet the demands of Hungary and 
then Czechoslovakia for the withdrawal of Soviet forces, Soviet officials now 
speak with some enthusiasm for bringing the troops home, thus ending a much 
regretted chapter in Soviet foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The major problem, Soviet officials say, is practical -- how to retrain, 
employ, resettle and house the officers and noncommissioned officers 
demobilized in the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly a fifth of those being demobilized -- Gorbachev unilaterally trimmed 
500,000 men from the 4.3-million-member defense forces this year -- need such 
retraining and resettlement. But the officers coming from East Germany will be 
even more of a problem because they have enjoyed better housing, better 
supplies of food and more consumer goods there than are available at home. 
</P>
<P>
If Moscow's East European deployments were cut back to the 195,000 limit 
proposed by Bush and accepted in principle by Gorbachev, the troops that 
remained would be concentrated in East Germany -- assuming that Moscow 
concludes the agreements it expects for the withdrawal of its forces from other 
Warsaw Pact countries.

Wataru Tanaka, a science fiction writer and self-described "aerospace 
exploration commentator," nearly became the first Japanese to venture into 
space. He hatched an outrageous plan four years ago to bring home a surplus 
American rocket and blast himself into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
But Tanaka, 58, whose credits include a book titled "The Taste of Lettuce Eaten 
In Space," gave up his dream after running into a wall of red tape. He counted 
26 laws and regulations administered by six government agencies that made his 
extraterrestrial mission all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka's countrymen are not far behind, though. After decades of quiet, modest 
research and development that attracted scant notice from abroad, Japan's 
official -- and unofficial -- space programs are now reaching critical mass. 
The effort could open yet another field where Japanese technological prowess 
translates into an economic challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Japan has become the third country, after the United States and the 
Soviet Union, to take aim at the moon. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 24, a small scientific research institute run on a shoestring budget by 
the Education Ministry launched "Muses-A," a lunar orbiter that, if successful, 
next month will become the first object from Earth to approach the moon since 
the Soviets sent up an unmanned probe in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
And in a peculiar drama that gives a new meaning to the "space race," Japanese 
government astronauts and private cosmonauts are competing to see who will be 
the first to take a Rising Sun flag to the heavens. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's primary space agency, the National Space Development Agency or NASDA, 
is training two men and a woman to serve as payload specialists on the U.S. 
space shuttle Atlantis in a flight scheduled for June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a commercial television network, Tokyo Broadcasting System, 
has paid a hefty sum, reportedly $10 million, to Moscow for the privilege of 
sending one of its journalists aboard the Soviet space station Mir in a mission 
that could come as early as the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
NASDA, meanwhile, is joining the European and Canadian space agencies in 
cooperative development of the U.S. space station Freedom. Japan is building a 
$2-billion laboratory module for the space station, which is expected to start 
orbiting the Earth in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
On the immediate horizon, the Japanese are focusing their efforts on commercial 
satellite launchings and other practical applications, such as last Wednesday's 
launch of a marine observation satellite by NASDA. 
</P>
<P>
But they also have long-range plans to send astronauts aloft in their own space 
shuttle. The government's Space Activities Commission proposed last June that 
Japan try launching its own space station by the year 2010. One of the 
country's major construction companies is designing a "space hotel," while 
another envisions a lunar resort offering "zero-gravity games" to shuttle-loads 
of Japanese tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the destiny of the human race," said Akira Kubozono, executive 
director of NASDA. "We Japanese have decided we must pursue manned space 
development. It's a dream, a romance. And if new technologies spin off in the 
process, we can always benefit by spreading them through industry." 
</P>
<P>
This bold vision of space development and the commercialization of related 
technologies may seem laughable given Japan's meager space budget. In the 
current fiscal year, Japan is spending about $1.1 billion on space, or less 
than a tenth of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
$12.3-billion budget. NASDA has 950 employees, as opposed to about 22,000 
working for NASA. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Muses-A moon mission demonstrates, impressive results sometimes can 
be achieved without astronomical spending. The scientific organization that 
launched the lunar orbiter, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science 
(ISAS), grew out of a low-key research laboratory at Tokyo University that 
pioneered Japan's efforts to escape gravity in 1955 by launching 9-inch-long 
"pencil rockets." 
</P>
<P>
(A replica of the first Japanese pencil rocket is on display at the National 
Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
ISAS, which now has a full-time staff of 105 and operates on a budget of about 
$145 million a year, has launched 19 satellites since 1970 with essentially 
home-grown technology. It made its first interplanetary voyage in 1985 and sent 
two satellites to rendezvous with Halley's comet the following year. Muses-A is 
designed to test the "swing-by" technique, by which the moon's gravitational 
pull will be used to catapult a second, tiny satellite into lunar orbit 
sometime around March 18. 
</P>
<P>
"After we finish with the moon in the 1990s, we may be ready to take on Mars," 
said Yasunori Matokawa, an ISAS official. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka, the writer and failed free-lance astronaut, predicts that it is only a 
matter of time before space fantasies start becoming reality here. When a 
Japanese finally flies in space, he said, the media hoopla can be expected to 
spark a boom in public interest and mobilize vast resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Japanese see something with their own eyes, they can understand it," said 
Tanaka, who also operates a space cafe in Tokyo called "Restaurant Goddard," 
after the U.S. rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard, who pioneered liquid fuel 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not good at imagining things we can't see, and at this point space 
exploration is entirely abstract," Tanaka said. "But when the time comes, you 
can count on the Japanese to jump out in front." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, early signs of space fever are already starting to appear. In April, 
Nippon Steel Corp. plans to open "Space World," a so-called "edu-tainment" 
theme park on the site of its shut-down plant in Yawata, in southwestern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the banner of diversification, the world's largest steelmaker will also 
run a space camp at the park, modeled after and licensed by the original one in 
Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. is marketing "space food" through the health food 
section of a major department store chain, and Uni-Charm Corp., a leading maker 
of sanitary napkins and disposable diapers, is now designing products for space 
travel. Both these companies, along with Sony and Minolta, have lined up as 
commercial sponsors for the Tokyo Broadcasting System's six-day ride aboard the 
Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
Toshio Nakanishi, a network spokesman, said the extravaganza was initially 
planned as a stunt to celebrate the commercial broadcaster's 40th anniversary 
next year, but it quickly took on a deeper meaning. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was necessary now for a Japanese to go to space," Nakanishi 
said. "So far, a total of about 200 people from 20 countries have been in 
space, but not a single Japanese. We're way behind, compared to the economic 
power we possess." 
</P>
<P>
The network plans to broadcast daily 10-minute live television spots from 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Author Tanaka is disturbed by the thought that a television journalist aboard a 
Soviet craft may be first Japanese in space, before one of NASDA's 
professionals rides on a friendly American space shuttle. (The original plan to 
have a Japanese payload specialist fly on the U.S. space shuttle two years ago 
was delayed by the Jan. 27, 1986, Challenger explosion.) 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a problem from a historic point of view if the first Japanese 
in space rides with the Soviets," he said. "This is a highly symbolic matter. 
The United States is our closest ally. We owe our postwar economic prosperity 
to America. I don't know where this idea comes from that you can buy whatever 
you want with money. We Japanese didn't used to think like this." 
</P>
<P>
NASDA's Kubozono was somewhat more philosophical about the network's deal with 
the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of room in space," Kubozono said. "They're making considerable 
noise about who's going to be first, but our aims are completely different. 
We're in this for science, not publicity. We may have feelings about it in our 
hearts, but we don't need to say anything out loud." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the confusion over who might actually be blazing the trail for 
Japanese space exploration is the subtle bureaucratic rivalry between NASDA, 
part of the Science and Technology Agency, and ISAS, part of the Education 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
NASDA is the younger of the two agencies, created in 1969 to pursue practical 
applications in space, and it receives the lion's share of the space budget. 
ISAS is ostensibly confined to scientific research -- Parliament even sets a 
limit on the diameter of the rockets it may build and launch, which was only 
recently expanded to 8 feet 3 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the division of labor is sometimes blurred. Both agencies are working on 
separate projects to develop an unmanned space plane, for example. And the fact 
that ISAS invented its own rocketry while NASDA imported technology from the 
United States, in a crash catch-up program, appears to be a lingering sore 
point for the latter agency. NASDA did not launch its first satellite until 
1975, five years after ISAS. 
</P>
<P>
Now, NASDA is exhibiting a stubborn pride -- and commercial interest -- in 
sticking to purely Japanese technology in developing the next generation of the 
H-II rocket, a two-stage, 108-foot-tall launch vehicle capable of carrying a 
two-ton payload. 
</P>
<P>
NASDA's earlier efforts were based on McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co.'s 
Delta rocket, and although its current workhorse rocket, the costly H-I, is 
about 80% Japanese, key components such as the first-stage engine rely on 
imported technology. The compulsion to go it alone has resulted in some serious 
problems and delays in the H-II development, however. 
</P>
<P>
Twice last year, the H-II's first-stage engine, the LE-7, caught fire during 
tests at NASDA's launch center on Tanega Shima, an island off Kagoshima in 
southwestern Japan. The problem, related to regulating the flow of liquid 
hydrogen into the combustion chamber, has already delayed completion of the 
H-II by one year, to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Although the engine is similar to those used on U.S. space shuttles, Tomifumi 
Godai, NASDA's chief of launch vehicle development, dismissed the idea of 
turning to the Americans for help, saying Japanese engineers would be able to 
solve the problem by themselves. Godai also insisted that the new rocket would 
be a cost-effective launch vehicle, capable of carrying satellites aloft at 
internationally competitive prices. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the H-II development limited to 100% domestic know-how is a crucial 
challenge because a bilateral agreement with the United States currently gives 
Washington veto power over the launching of third-country satellites when U.S. 
technology is involved. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is the potentially lucrative market for commercial satellite 
launching, which Arianespace, the European consortium, now dominates. But even 
if NASDA overcomes its H-II engine troubles, other barriers to competitiveness 
remain, not the least of which is an agreement with local fishermen limiting 
launch schedules to two 45-day windows, one in summer and one in winter. Noise 
from the rockets supposedly scares away the tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Americans who recall dismissing those first imported fleets of homely 
Japanese cars in the 1960s might think twice before laughing away Japanese 
ambitions in space. Japan went on to out-finesse the U.S. auto industry, it may 
be recalled, after starting very small. 
</P>
<P>
And a familiar name is on the cutting edge of Japan's space technology: 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the company that built the Zero fighter 50 
years ago and more recently lobbied unsuccessfully to go it alone designing 
Japan's next generation jet fighter, the FSX. 
</P>
<P>
A co-development agreement to license technology from the U.S. front-line 
fighter, the F-16, to Mitsubishi Heavy for the FSX was nearly scuttled in a 
last-minute attack by critics in Washington last year. Opponents argued that 
the deal handed over key technology that Japan could later use to compete 
against the United States in the aerospace and commercial airliner industry. 
</P>
<P>
A residue of mutual suspicion left by the FSX dispute, coupled with unresolved 
U.S. frustrations over a contentious trade complaint about American commercial 
satellites sales to Japanese government agencies, perhaps colors the atmosphere 
in cooperative space development. 
</P>
<P>
According to news reports, Kubozono expressed irritation over delays in the 
Freedom space station program when he visited Washington recently. In general, 
the Japanese appear to be growing wary of relying on the United States and its 
vastly superior experience in space. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't depend on another country. If you don't have advanced technology of 
your own, it's impossible to truly participate in international cooperation," 
said Matokawa of ISAS. "From now on, I suppose we'll go on relying on NASA; at 
the same time we'll have to develop our own independent capabilities."

EDUCATION: THE NO. 2 ADMINISTRATOR AT UC IRVINE, A NATIVE OF CHINA, IS REPORTED 
TO BE A LEADING CANDIDATE FOR THE CHANCELLORSHIP.

Chang-Lin Tien, the No. 2 administrator at UC Irvine, is a leading candidate to 
become chancellor of UC Berkeley and thus the first Asian-American to head a UC 
campus, sources said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tien, a 53-year-old native of China, is an internationally recognized expert in 
mechanical engineering and a former vice chancellor for research at Berkeley. 
He joined the faculty there in 1959 and went to UC Irvine as executive vice 
chancellor in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
If chosen, Tien, who once faced segregated drinking fountains in Kentucky, 
would head a prestigious and argumentative campus that has been under fire for 
its policies on admission of Asian-American students and hiring of minority 
faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Tien declined to comment Sunday on reports from several sources that he is 
among the finalists recommended to UC President David P. Gardner by a search 
committee. "Any comment has to come from the university," Tien said. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner must recommend one name to the UC Board of Regents to succeed Ira 
Michael Heyman, who is retiring after 10 years as chancellor. The regents are 
to meet Thursday in San Francisco to discuss the location of the first of three 
proposed new campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kolb, a spokesman for Gardner, said Sunday that if the Berkeley 
chancellorship is to be taken up at that meeting, the matter would have to be 
added to the agenda by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that President Gardner has not made a decision or a 
recommendation," Kolb said. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty and administrators at Irvine said Tien's candidacy had been rumored 
there for months. Several were disappointed by the reports and said they would 
consider the departure of the administrator and scientist a great blow to UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"To be quite truthful, I'm kind of disappointed if he's leaving," said John 
Liu, co-chairman of Irvine's Asian Faculty Staff Assn. "I think he's brought 
dialogue that the campus has long needed and he has shown a sensitivity to a 
lot of pressing issues that the administration hasn't always done." 
</P>
<P>
Liu and others said Tien has played a leading role in recruiting minority 
faculty to the Orange County campus and instituting a new "international 
breadth requirement." As of next year, all incoming freshmen will be required 
to take one class on a multicultural issue and one class on an international 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Jones, associate vice chancellor at Irvine, said Tien has also taken 
steps to give faculty a greater voice in managing the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Tien was born in Wuhan and fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communist takeover 
on the mainland. He graduated from National Taiwan University and earned a 
master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got off at the bus station, I saw drinking fountains that said 'whites 
only' and drinking fountains for 'colored,' " Tien told The Times in a 1988 
interview. "I was very disturbed. I didn't know which fountain I was supposed 
to use." 
</P>
<P>
Tien went on to earn a second master's degree and then a doctorate in 
mechanical engineering from Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
Tien has won a distinguished teaching award from Berkeley, a Guggenheim 
fellowship, and prestigious scientific awards from West Germany and Hong Kong. 
He also held the Berlin Chair in Mechanical Engineering at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
As a consultant for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, he 
helped solve the problem of keeping heat-shielding tiles from falling off U.S. 
space shuttles in the early days of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Tien lives with his wife, Di-Hwa, in University Hills.

WILSON TAKES SHOT AT CRIME AS HE OPENS GOVERNOR BID; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATOR OFFICIALLY TOSSES HIS HAT IN THE RING. HE 
HAS NO GOP OPPOSITION FOR THE NOMINATION.

<P>
Former U.S. Marine, state legislator, mayor of San Diego, and now U.S. senator 
and great hope of the California Republican Party, Pete Wilson officially 
entered the race for governor Sunday, his third try. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old, still boyish-faced Wilson began a four-day barnstorm of 
California in San Diego, the town he calls home, and then headed north reciting 
from Chapter 1 of the time-worn GOP campaign playbook -- the feverish politics 
of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not have California under siege to rapists and thugs and drug dealers!" 
Wilson told an audience of 200 outside the San Diego Police Officers' Assn. 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
He repeated the speech to about 300 people at a picnic at the Los Angeles 
Police Academy, to 250 people in Alameda and to 350 people at the Railroad 
Museum in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
At each of the three stops, Wilson was greeted enthusiastically. In the only 
sign of dissent he encountered, 15 anti-abortion demonstrators picketed his 
Sacramento appearance because of Wilson's support for a woman's right to choose 
whether to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990 gubernatorial preliminaries, Wilson sketched an activist agenda of 
environmental protection, political independence and increased attention to 
social problems and progress. Buthose themes were left in the background at the 
formal campaign kickoff Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson surrounded himself with police and prosecutors and focused 
single-mindedly on what he said was California's No. 1 problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bitter irony that, despite our having perhaps the most pro-law 
enforcement governor in our history, in George Deukmejian, and the most skilled 
and dedicated law enforcement professionals to be found anywhere, California's 
streets are needlessly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a misnomer to speak of a California criminal justice system. The people 
of California have lost confidence in the ability of that system to protect 
them. They are afraid -- afraid in their homes and afraid to leave them. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Wilson said, "that situation is intolerable and I mean to bring it to 
an end." 
</P>
<P>
Along with his speech, Wilson announced endorsements from a dozen law 
enforcement groups, representing rank-and-file officers and police chiefs, and 
from 300 prosecutors across the state. "I've never seen anything like it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In subsequent days of his extended ritual "announcement" tour of the state, 
Wilson plans to broaden his pitch to include education and quality-of-life 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
The senator is seeking to duplicate what George Bush accomplished at the 
national level last election -- maintain Republican control of an office after 
an eight-year GOP Administration. Not in 30 years has one party held the 
governorship of California for more than two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
A Republican who can be described as a moderate on social issues and a 
conservative on economic matters and foreign policy, Wilson enters the GOP race 
in a happy and commanding position. He is the undisputed leader of his party, 
and has no substantive GOP challenge to his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
This is a source of deep satisfaction, given his two previous runs at the 
office. In 1978, the GOP Establishment gave him the cold shoulder and he 
finished fourth in a field of five in the Republican primary. Four years later, 
he set out again for the office but was persuaded by GOP elders to run for the 
U.S. Senate. He won the primary and was elected over Democrat Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., then the governor. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson begins this campaign with substantial advantages. While he has a 
seemingly united party at his command, Democrats face a costly and potentially 
draining primary battle between Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. And Wilson has shown the capacity to raise 
twice as much money as either of the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wilson's early campaign is not without its skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
Some doubt his gusto in looking forward and engaging California's growing list 
of problems. His speeches Sunday were often vaguer than even typical political 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
"California is besieged by big problems, there is no denying that. But no state 
is blessed with more ability to solve those problems -- if we have the right 
leader," Wilson said. "And guess who that is?" 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, his campaign was involved in a fund-raising drive that underscored 
Wilson's apparent confidence in a strategy that looks back as much as forward. 
A solicitation letter mailed to about 60,000 Republicans did not mention his 
opponents but liberally fanned years-old hostilities toward Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the leading Democrat candidates for governor has criticized Jerry 
Brown for his mismanagement of California," said the letter, signed by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, Wilson has offered ideas for the new decade, such as a stronger 
educational effort to help young children and improved health care. But he has 
been reluctant to commit significant additional government financing. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of crime, however, Wilson was both specific and emphatic Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He touted his role as the chairman of a June ballot proposition to speed up 
criminal trials. This grass-roots initiative is the work of an active and vocal 
group of crime victims and their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd that it took four years to bring the 'Night Stalker' to trial, 
that it requires two years on average to bring an alleged felon to trial in 
California," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
He went further, even at the risk of over-promising. A drug-free California, 
for instance. "I promise you we will succeed in this." 
</P>
<P>
Later, aboard his twin-engine propeller campaign charter that lumbered through 
the skies of Central California, Wilson was asked if his kind of pledge was 
realistic. "I think you have to aim high," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
One way to counter drugs, Wilson continued, is drug testing of first-time 
recipients of driver's licenses. He proposed that young drivers face such tests 
randomly for a year after receiving their license. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the crime victims movement and assorted law enforcement supporters 
joined the Wilson entourage on Sunday's campaign swing. Also along was Wilson's 
wife, Gayle, an enthusiastic campaigner; her two sons from a previous marriage, 
Todd and Phillip Graham; and no fewer than eight campaign assistants. 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious to everyone that Wilson's third campaign for governor was vastly 
different from his earlier tries. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on some experience and successes, you get to feeling more confidence," 
Wilson said in an informal chat with reporters. "Ever since people asked us to 
consider running this time, it's been remarkable." 
</P>

The head of the American Medical Assn. has resigned because of an inquiry into 
financial transactions, the doctors' group said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
James H. Sammons, chief executive of the 300,000-member organization, said he 
was retiring 10 months earlier than planned because the financial questions 
were interfering with his job. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern was that there was so much inordinate time and energy that was 
going into answering all of these things, and the AMA has got to get on with 
the business of looking at the health care of this country," he said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Sammons, 62, has been under scrutiny for a $350,000 bailout in pension fund 
stock losses to one AMA executive and for a home loan to another association 
official. He has denied any impropriety.

Six convicts, including three murderers, escaped from the maximum-security 
Joliet Correctional Center early Sunday, apparently by cutting through metal 
bars, state police said. One was captured later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The escapees, most in their 20s and all in segregation cells as disciplinary 
problems, were considered extremely dangerous, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Munoz was captured shortly after 5:30 p.m. at a cousin's Chicago home by 
officers who had staked it out, state Department of Corrections spokesman Nic 
Howell said. Munoz, 22, was serving a sentence for narcotics violations and 
intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
A search with dogs and an airplane was called off because the escapees 
apparently split up, state police trooper Thomas Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The prisoners escaped from the segregation cells, authorities said. Four of the 
inmates were doubled up in cells and the other two were in cells alone. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of when the prisoners escaped changed over the course of the day. State 
police originally reported the men were discovered missing at 4:55 a.m., but 
Howell said later that the discovery was made after a 7 a.m. inmate count came 
up short. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 corrections officers specially trained to deal with escapes assisted 
state police and local law enforcement officers in the search. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates had to cut through bars on the cells, break a window, cut through 
bars outside the window and cross a fence to get away, Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, this is a breach of security," he said. "They shouldn't have had 
the materials to be able to cut with and should not have been able to cut like 
this without being noticed." 
</P>
<P>
The prison, which has been plagued by overcrowding in recent years, is one of 
the state's four maximum-security facilities and one of two in Joliet.

NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner emerged Sunday from talks with President 
Bush to suggest that a reunified Germany could be a part of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization without extending NATO's military reach over the territory 
that is now East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Woerner said a way can and will be found to keep a united Germany in NATO while 
recognizing "the legitimate security interests of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
After two days of talks at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., both 
Bush and Woerner hailed what the White House called West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's "extraordinarily successful" talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said Saturday that he received "unequivocal" assurances from Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Moscow would respect the right of the two 
Germanys to decide for themselves the timing and structure of their 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said Bush and Woerner agreed that NATO "should adopt new 
political roles," including helping shape U.S. policies toward the East Bloc 
nations now moving toward democracy.

'WAY IS FREE' FOR GERMAN REUNIFICATION, KOHL SAYS

<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday 
that "the way is now free" for German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
His meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev convinced him, he told 
West German radio, that the two German states should "enter into negotiations 
as quickly as possible" after the March 18 East German election. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl will meet with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on Tuesday and 
Wednesday in Bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation, including 
monetary union, to prevent the collapse of the faltering East German economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Political and economic union go hand in hand," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to "stop the 
hemorrhage of East Germans to the Federal Republic and keep them in their 
heimat," or home, in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a 
matter for the Germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an "economic 
breakthrough" in East Germany, which in turn could provide a "push forward" for 
all of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how soon the two Germanys could merge, Kohl declared that the March 
election has to come first, and "then I think it will all go very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition 
groups in East Germany now support reunification. And after the election, he 
said, "they will want to put their programs into practice quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev inquired about plans by West German politicians to campaign in East 
Germany, Kohl said, adding that the Soviet leader did not appear to be upset 
about such political activity. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Social Democratic Party is expected to campaign heavily in East 
Germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a 
surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
Major members of the party, including former Chancellor Willy Brandt, are 
scheduled to appear at rallies on behalf of the East German Social Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
With the surge of the East German Social Democrats, political analysts are 
pointing to the strange role they could play in the ultimate political fate of 
Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since reunification became a blazing issue, Kohl's standing in West German 
opinion polls has risen, and if the national elections, now scheduled for 
December, were held today, he would have a good chance of leading his Christian 
Democratic Union to victory. 
</P>
<P>
But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, 
the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany -- 
who would presumably be allowed to vote in December -- could easily tip the 
balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government 
leadership.

A DIFFERENT WORLD, THE SAME CAUSE;

<P>
APARTHEID: MANDELA'S PRINCIPLED STANDS OF DECADES AGO REMAIN THE BIBLE FOR 
BLACK ACTIVISTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1964, when 45-year-old Nelson Mandela and seven other men were 
sentenced to life in prison for sabotage, the Beatles were touring Australia, 
winter coats were selling for $10 and Ford Motor Co. was proudly increasing its 
investment in what it called "a prosperous South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
South Africa and the world have changed drastically since the days when Mandela 
and his colleagues launched the armed struggle against apartheid. Thousands of 
blacks have died in South Africa, hundreds of bombs have exploded and three 
leaders of the ruling National Party have come and gone, always clinging 
desperately to legally prescribed racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in all those years, Mandela's principled stands on the enduring problems 
facing this wealthy, white minority-ruled country have remained steadfastly 
unchanged. And those stands, unmarked by bitterness or emotion, have been the 
bible that generations of African National Congress leaders have turned to for 
answers to the problems of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I have done my duty to my people and to South Africa," the tall lawyer told a 
court during a 1956 treason trial for which he received a five-year prison 
term. "I have no doubt that posterity will pronounce that I was innocent and 
that the criminals that should have been brought before this court are the 
members of the (white) government." 
</P>
<P>
It was Mandela's speech from the dock during his later sabotage trial, after 
which he was sentenced to life in prison, that publicly established the moral 
underpinings of the armed black liberation struggle and became one of the most 
famous speeches in South African history. On that April day in 1964, he 
admitted having founded Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, the military 
wing of the then-banned African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not deny that I planned sabotage," he said. "I did not do this in a 
spirit of recklessness . . . but as a result of a calm and sober assessment of 
the situation after many years of opposition and tyranny of my people by 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
"All lawful modes of expressing opposition to this principle had been closed by 
legislation," he said. "We were placed in a position in which we had either to 
accept a permanent state of inferiority or defy the government. We chose to 
defy the government." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, in announcing Mandela's release on Sunday, President Frederik W. 
de Klerk said he is convinced that Mandela is committed to peaceful solutions 
to the country's problems. But it is the government, not Mandela, that has 
changed its position on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, then-President Pieter W. Botha made world headlines when he offered to 
release Mandela if the prisoner would renounce violence. Mandela's answer, 
smuggled out by his daughter, Zindzi, and read to a rally that year, showed 
that in more than two decades behind bars, he had not changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Only free men can negotiate," his statement bluntly responded. "Prisoners 
cannot enter into contracts." 
</P>
<P>
And a few months ago, at age 71, Mandela indicated that his years in prison 
have not softened his stance on violence. 
</P>
<P>
"White South Africa must accept the plain fact that the ANC will not suspend, 
to say nothing of abandoning, the armed struggle until the government shows its 
willingness to surrender the monopoly of political power, and to negotiate 
directly and in good faith with acknowledged black leaders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those words were contained in a lengthy policy statement that Mandela wrote in 
sturdy longhand and presented to the government last year. As in the 1950s, 
when Mandela asked the government to negotiate with the ANC and was spurned, he 
was again urging talks. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only did the government ignore our demands for a meeting (but) it took 
advantage of our commitment to a nonviolent struggle and unleashed the most 
violent form of racial oppression this country has ever seen," Mandela had said 
in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, it came amid a new era in which De Klerk's government was 
actively talking with its most famous prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
"My views are still the same," Mandela wrote the government last year. "The ANC 
. . . has no vested interest in violence. It abhors any action which may cause 
loss of life, destruction of property and misery to the people. 
</P>
<P>
"But we consider the armed struggle a legitimate form of self-defense against a 
morally repugnant system of government which will not allow even peaceful forms 
of protest." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Mandela held no bitterness against the government and he again made a peace 
offering, an attempt, he said, "to bring the country's two major political 
bodies to the negotiating table."

MOOD GRIM AT '64 TRIAL OF MANDELA; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: THE JUDGE PONDERED NOT GUILT OR INNOCENCE BUT LIFE OR DEATH.

<P>
When red-robed Judge Quartus de Wet, sitting in Courtroom C of the Palace of 
Justice here, considered the case against Nelson R. Mandela in 1964, it was not 
a question of guilt or innocence that he pondered. 
</P>
<P>
It was whether to send Mandela and seven co-defendants to Death Row or give 
them life sentences. A ninth man, Lionel Bernstein, was acquitted but arrested 
after the trial and banned. 
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere was very grim," remembers George Bizos, a Johannesburg lawyer 
who was on the defense team. "There was a great hue and cry in the country, and 
a great fear among us all, that they would be sentenced to death." 
</P>
<P>
In his statement to the judge, introduced without cross-examination, Mandela 
had admitted his role in launching Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, 
the military wing of the then-banned African National Congress, and he said he 
was prepared to die for what he believed. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't just rhetoric," said Bizos, who is still one of Mandela's lawyers 
and a longtime friend. "Nelson has a sense of history, and he considered 
himself as one of a line of people who had been dealt with harshly by the law." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants were charged with sabotage, a capital crime equal to treason 
under South African law. The state accused them of recruiting people to make 
explosives and training them to plant them. In all, the charge sheet listed 
nearly 200 attacks of sabotage and damage to property aimed at symbols of 
apartheid, such as rail lines and pass offices, during 1961-63. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants and their four attorneys discussed whether they should even 
testify in their own defense, with some arguing that doing so would be 
tantamount to accepting the legality of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
But, because the government planned to cross swords with the defendants on 
political issues, it was decided that the defendants would place their 
positions on record. The resulting speech from the prisoner's dock by Mandela, 
delivered to a packed courtroom in 1964, came to be the guiding document for 
the armed struggle against Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Their defense was that they had no option, given the violence launched by the 
state against peaceful protest, and they argued that it was nothing more than 
what the white Afrikaner people had done years earlier to win 
self-determination under British colonial rule. As Umkhonto we Sizwe's 
manifesto, seized by police, had said: "There comes a time in the life of a 
nation when they can no longer turn the other cheek." 
</P>
<P>
"As a legal defense, it wasn't one," Bizos says. "There was no legal defense. 
They said, 'Yes, we formed this organization.' There was no attempt to avoid 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
In his closing arguments, Percy Yutar, the deputy attorney general, said he was 
amazed by the "conceit and deceit" of the defendants, who he contended 
represented less than 1% of the black population. 
</P>
<P>
Yutar described the crime as "a classic case of the intended overthrow of the 
government by force and violence. It is tragic to think that the accused, who 
between them did not have the courage to commit a single act of sabotage 
themselves, should have incited their followers to acts of guerrilla warfare, 
open rebellion and ultimately civil war." 
</P>
<P>
Judge De Wet, who had heard the lawyer Mandela defend clients in his courtroom 
many times, sentenced the eight convicted men to life in prison, saying "that 
is the only leniency I can show." 
</P>
<P>
"The primary concern was to save their lives," Bizos said. "And the verdict was 
a tremendous relief. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling at the time, both of the prisoners and ourselves, was that the 
life sentence would not be served," he added. "Certainly we didn't think in 
terms of 26 or 27 years. Somehow it always seemed that apartheid would come to 
an end within the near future." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, released Sunday, was the last to regain his freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Goldberg was released in 1985 after accepting President Pieter W. 
Botha's offer of an amnesty if he renounced violence. As a white, he had not 
been sent with the others to Robben Island prison, northwest of Cape Town, but 
was jailed on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Govan Mbeki, born in 1910 and the oldest defendant, was freed in November, 
1987, but was subjected to a banning order and restricted to Port Elizabeth 
until last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Five were released last October under President Frederik W. De Klerk's pledge 
to start negotiations with black leaders. The most prominent is Walter Sisulu, 
former secretary general of the ANC, and regarded as Mandela's closest 
associate. He was placed under restrictions until Feb. 2 when De Klerk 
announced sweeping reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The others freed last fall were Raymond Mhlaba, a trade union activist and 
anti-apartheid worker; Andrew Mlangeni, a former newspaper writer and one of 
the founding members of Umkhonto we Sizwe; Ahmed Kathrada, head of a left-wing 
Indian organization and member of Umkhonto we Sizwe's high command; and Elias 
Matsoaledi, a union activist and leading member of Umkhonto we Sizwe.

They had waited throughout the night and into the dawn Sunday at Los Angeles' 
First African Methodist Episcopal Church. When the moment came, shortly after 6 
a.m. here, it was as sweet as promised. 
</P>
<P>
As the image of a freed Nelson R. Mandela flashed on TV screens in First AME's 
crowded annex, the roomful of revelers surged. First came a deafening cheer, 
then fists started pumping into the air. 
</P>
<P>
A cappella strains of the black anthem "Lift Every Voice and Sing" were drowned 
out by shouts of "Free at last, Mandela!" 
</P>
<P>
Half a world away, amid a similar throng of South African supporters, Mandela 
looked up, smiled, then waved. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the African National Congress leader walking away from his Cape 
Town prison evoked tears from many of the 200 anti-apartheid activists who 
huddled around television sets at the church in Los Angeles' West Adams 
district. 
</P>
<P>
At every glimpse of the 71-year-old man whose plight had become a symbol of 
oppression suffered by black South Africa, the group cheered. 
</P>
<P>
The room then slipped into a graceful sway that matched the rhythm of freedom 
anthems led by organizers from more than a dozen student and activist groups. 
</P>
<P>
Starting at 6 p.m. Saturday, the gathering had waited for the early-morning 
release of Mandela. During the night, speakers from around the county and some 
recently from South Africa described conditions under the government system 
that kept Mandela imprisoned for more than 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Walimu Evans, 47, founder of the Nelson R. Mandela Educational Institute in 
Compton, said she named her nursery and elementary school after the ANC leader 
because she "was impressed that Mandela stayed true to what he believed." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted the kids to learn about sticking with what they believe and that by 
(doing so) they can eventually succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela has made an impression on even her youngest students, including Nia 
Ujamaa, 8, a fourth-grader at the institute who came to the vigil with her 
godmother. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that he is a freedom fighter and that he was put in jail for trying to 
help the people who are like slaves in South Africa," Nia said at about 2:30 
a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As the girl picked up a sleeping bag and pillow and trooped upstairs to take a 
nap, she added, "I also know that his being free means the other people can be 
free too." 
</P>
<P>
Between speakers during the vigil, an African traditional dance company from 
Los Angeles provided impromptu performances. 
</P>
<P>
"The world needs a lot of healing," said Nzingha Camara, director of Le Ballet 
de Kouman Kele, which specializes in a West African form of "healing dance" 
called lambda. "Mandela is one who is trying to heal the ills of South Africa. 
That's why we wanted to do lambda tonight." 
</P>
<P>
After the revelry that had surrounded Mandela's release began to subside, some 
people voiced words of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too premature to say that the system is really changing," said Sam 
Phillips, 41, a performing arts teacher who left South Africa in 1987. "What 
(Mandela's release) does do is signify that a black man can fight to the end. I 
see it as a sign that the struggle is intensifying." 
</P>
<P>
Lebo Morake, a member of the student group Themba (Hope), told the audience 
that the apartheid system that separates its victims according to race must be 
challenged by all those who are oppressed. 
</P>
<P>
"Unity is our number one weapon," Morake said. "It is in fact our only weapon." 
</P>
<P>
After the vigil, celebrations over Mandela's release continued. 
</P>
<P>
During two crowded church services at First AME, sermons by ministers were 
sprinkled with references to his release. A choir member interrupted her solo 
to praise Mandela. After the services, members of the congregation walked 
through the neighborhood displaying a placard that read: "Mandela Is Free." 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, 300 protesters marched in front of the South African 
Consulate in Beverly Hills in a demonstration organized by the Southern 
California chapter of the African National Congress. They covered the front of 
the building with black, green and gold ANC flags. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters demanded that the consulate vacate its offices and that the City of 
Beverly Hills rename the building. As the demands were recited, protesters 
unfurled a banner that read: "Welcome to Nelson Mandela Square."

TROOPS STILL FIGHTING REBELS FOR KEY PORT, ETHIOPIA SAYS;

CIVIL WAR: FAMINE RELIEF EFFORTS ARE HALTED AS BATTLE ENTERS FOURTH DAY,

<P>
Government troops and secessionist rebels battled for a fourth day Sunday for 
Ethiopia's vital Red Sea port of Massawa, state radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday morning broadcast by the government-controlled station conflicted 
with a report Saturday night by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front that it 
had captured the city. 
</P>
<P>
The government broadcast did not directly deny the claim by the rebels' 
clandestine radio station, but it said fighting is continuing around the port, 
one of only two on Ethiopia's Red Sea coast. The other port is Assab, near the 
border with Djibouti. 
</P>
<P>
Massawa is a key staging point for emergency food donated through the United 
Nations for an estimated 4 million people facing famine in northern Ethiopia 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ashagre Yigletu, deputy prime minister for social affairs, reported that the 
renewed fighting around Massawa had effectively halted the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations hoped to ship 700,000 tons of food in the next few months to 
northern drought victims, most of them in Eritrea and neighboring Tigre 
province. Most of that aid would have been delivered by ship to Massawa, 
although detailed plans for its distribution have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels broke an almost yearlong lull in fighting in Eritrea by launching a 
massive offensive Thursday that clearly had the capture of Massawa as a primary 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
In the first three days of fighting, the rebels claimed to have destroyed eight 
government brigades totaling about 12,000 troops, most of them entrenched along 
the 40-mile road linking Massawa with the provincial capital of Asmara. 
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean rebel attack erupted as the government appeared to be containing 
another offensive to the south by a separate insurgent group, the Tigre 
People's Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tesfaye Dinka told diplomats in Addis Ababa that the Eritrean 
offensive appeared aimed at taking pressure off the Tigrean rebels. 
</P>
<P>
While they do not share common goals, the two insurgent groups have long 
maintained a loose alliance and have been known to coordinate their attacks 
against government forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigrean rebels launched their own offensive in late August, sweeping south 
and west. 
</P>
<P>
A government counteroffensive begun in January appeared to have halted and in 
some areas pushed back the Tigreans' southern drive.

PHILIPPINE BASE TALKS LIKELY TO BE COMBATIVE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: SECRETARY CHENEY SAYS HE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP TWO KEY FACILITIES BUT 
ONLY ON FAVORABLE TERMS. PRESIDENT AQUINO DECLINES TO MEET HIM.

<P>
Staking out a firm early negotiating posture in talks on the future of two key 
U.S. military bases in the Philippines, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said 
Sunday that the Pentagon wants to keep the bases, but only on terms favorable 
to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who is in Honolulu at the start of a two-week visit to Asia, said: 
"Obviously, we are interested in renewing the base rights agreement, (but) it's 
only going to happen if both parties can reach acceptable understanding. It has 
to be on the basis that the Filipinos want us there and it is in accordance 
with terms we can accept." 
</P>
<P>
The base negotiations, certain to be the most contentious ever between the two 
countries, are scheduled to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials are entering the talks in an equally combative mood. 
President Corazon Aquino said Sunday that she will not meet with Cheney when he 
arrives in Manila on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio address, she complained about recent statements by U.S. 
officials that appeared hostile to her government. Senior officials in 
Washington have questioned the Aquino government's ability to handle a 
continuing leftist insurgency and to run public services free of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
A Cheney spokesman, while playing down the significance of the Aquino 
controversy, noted that Cheney's schedule had been changed so that he will 
spend two rather than the previously planned three days in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
He will meet there with Defense Minister Fidel V. Ramos and visit U.S. naval 
and air forces. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney indicated that the Pentagon was planning for the possibility that U.S. 
troops stationed at Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base would be forced 
out, if not in this round of talks then within the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously will stay only as long as we're wanted," Cheney said Friday 
before leaving Washington. "We hope to be able to come to an acceptable 
agreement, but it obviously has to be acceptable to both parties, both the U.S. 
and the Philippines, or we will have no other choice but to depart." 
</P>
<P>
Other defense officials have said privately that the United States could move 
the ships and aircraft to new or existing bases in Japan, Guam or Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Pentagon official noted pointedly on Friday: "It's not that they're 
irreplaceable" 
</P>
<P>
Cheney also plans to visit Japan and Korea, where he will be discussing 
withdrawal of some U.S. troops from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
He said there will be "some redeployments" of U.S. forces based in Asia but not 
on the scale planned for Europe, where the United States has offered to 
withdraw fully a third of its land-based troops.

VOLUNTEERS TO BE TRAINED BEFORE HANDLING WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials are asking volunteers who want to help find and clean oil-injured 
wildlife not to telephone with any inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, volunteers are to go to an outdoor training facility set up on a 
grassy area next to the beach at Pacific Coast Highway and Lake Street in 
Huntington Beach before they may help in the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute training sessions are offered at 10 a.m. and noon each day. After 
completing one of the sessions, volunteers are issued rubber gloves, boots and 
an orange hat, then assigned to teams that rove the beach in search of injured 
birds and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers are being used only to find and clean wildlife, not to assist in the 
oil cleanup.

Police arrested a Capitol lobbyist for allegedly arranging to have the home of 
Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose) painted for free, officials said. 
Carl Burg, 65, executive director of the Painting &amp; Decorating Contractors 
of California Inc., was booked into the Sacramento County Jail on suspicion of 
unlawfully arranging a gift through a third party to Cortese and released on 
$500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the misdemeanor, Burg could be sentenced to six months in jail 
and given a $10,000 fine. Dist. Atty. Steven White said Burg represented a 
painters' union that wanted a bill carried by Cortese to pass. Cortese issued a 
statement saying he was sorry to hear of Burg's arrest. "I cooperated fully 
with the attorney general's office on this matter. Several months ago the 
attorney general's office informed me that nothing was going to be pursued as 
to my involvement," Cortese said.

DOG PEDIGREE PAPERS ARE LABELED 'A JOKE'

The American Kennel Club has certified thousands of dogs across the country 
that investigators contend were fraudulently registered and others whose 
pedigrees are uncertain, according to a newspaper report. "The breeders and the 
pet stores all know the AKC papers are a joke, but they make their livelihood 
on it," Robert Baker, a veteran investigator with the Humane Society of the 
United States, told the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials said the organization routinely accepts a dog owner's word that 
an animal is a purebred and does little to verify the applications for the 1.3 
million dogs it registers each year. "Basically, the whole system is based on 
trust; let's face it," said AKC President Kenneth Marden. The AKC has never 
said registering a dog guarantees its breeding, he said, although the public 
generally believes that to be true.

COURT TO DECIDE ON COAL-BURNING PLANT

<TEXT>
<P>
Attorneys for a coalition of farmers and environmentalists told a state 
appellate court it should overturn approval of a $43-million coal-burning power 
plant because it violates environmental law and will further damage crop 
production in the San Joaquin Valley, the nation's richest farming region. 
Chris Garrett, attorney for GWF Inc., the power company, told judges of the 5th 
District Court of Appeal that the project has state-of-the-art coal-burning 
technology that will not damage air quality. 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys representing the coalition argued before that the project 
violates the California Environmental Quality Act and would spew nearly 1,700 
pounds of noxious gases and particulate matter into the air daily. They noted 
that damage from poor air quality to Kings County's cotton crop already amounts 
to $30 million a year.

PATROLS TRY TO STOP HARASSING OF WHALES

Coast Guard and National Marine Fisheries Service agents began patrolling the 
San Diego coast to prevent weekend boaters from harassing migrating gray 
whales, officials said. The huge mammals, which are protected under the Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, travel down the coast on their journey from Alaska to 
their breeding grounds off Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody starts out their day by saying, 'Let's go harass some 
whales today.' I think they just want to get closer," Fisheries agent Ray 
Sautter said. "But when you start seeing boats that are making course changes 
to pursue the whales and whales making course changes to evade the boats, that 
is a violation." Sautter said he called for the patrols after observing boaters 
while he took a whale-watching cruise. Fines for harassing whales could be as 
high as $25,000, he said.

THOUSANDS LOSE WELFARE BENEFITS AS PART OF EXPERIMENT, REPORT SAYS

Thousands of poor people in Texas and four other states -- Ohio, Washington, 
New York and Wisconsin -- are unwitting subjects in a federal experiment that 
denies some aid to a portion of them to see how well they live without it, a 
newspaper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Extra Medicaid and child-care benefits now go to about 8,000 people in five 
regions of Texas, while about 800 people -- selected at random -- are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
On April 1, those extra benefits will be available to more than 50,000 people 
statewide -- but not to the 800 unlucky Texans who face two more years without 
the help, the Dallas Morning News reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas pilot program targets welfare recipients who find jobs or job 
training. Traditionally, such recipients have received four months of free 
medical care, plus some child care, after they leave the welfare rolls. The 
experimental program extended the benefits to one year of Medicaid coverage and 
subsidized child care -- to all but the 800. 
</P>
<P>
The theory is that the extended benefits will spur people to take and stay with 
entry-level jobs that are unlikely to offer medical insurance or child care 
immediately.

TORNADO CLEANUP UNDER WAY IN SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of work crews took to the streets across Georgia and Alabama on 
Sunday to clean up from a barrage of powerful thunderstorms and tornadoes that 
wrecked dozens of homes and knocked out power to 600,000 utility customers. 
</P>
<P>
Some 38,000 homes in Alabama and 14,000 in Georgia remained without power 
Sunday as utility crews worked to clear away fallen tree limbs and replace 
downed power lines, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of Saturday's storms, 500,000 homes were without power in 
Georgia, mostly in the Atlanta area. The storms cut electricity to 112,000 
homes across Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 13 tornadoes and straight-line winds to 90 m.p.h. tore through the South 
on Saturday, killing at least four people and injuring scores of others. 
Tornadoes were reported in Georgia, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, Florida and 
South Carolina, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
"This really qualifies as the worst storm we've had since 1973," said Tripp 
Cagle, a spokesman for the Georgia Power Co. "We're hoping we can get everyone 
on by Sunday night." 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 cleanup crews from sheriffs' departments and other law 
enforcement agencies were clearing debris and downed trees all over Georgia, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service said the most serious tornado struck in south Cobb County 
in suburban Atlanta, leveling six homes and damaging 44 others in one 
subdivision. The weather service said the tornado's winds reached 115 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Four people in the Atlanta area were killed by falling trees. 
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, Lawrence Bowden of the state Emergency Management Agency said a 
damage survey showed more than 300 mobile homes and houses were destroyed and 
as many as 50 businesses were either destroyed or damaged. A dollar estimate on 
the damage had not yet been made, he said. More than 40 people were injured, 
nine requiring hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeless Alabamians were put up in shelters Saturday night but most stayed 
with relatives, Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific Northwest, another wave of Pacific storms pushed ashore in 
Washington and Oregon, triggering heavy rains and snow above 500 feet. A 
half-inch of rain soaked the coastal town of Astoria, Ore., during a six-hour 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Storms over the last two weeks have dropped 85 inches of snow over the 
Washington Cascades, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
Winds gusting to 60 m.p.h. prompted the weather service to post high wind 
warnings for eastern Washington. High wind warnings also were in effect for 
parts of Idaho and Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Showers and thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain in southern Florida. 
Nearly an inch of rain fell at Ft. Myers and a half inch at Vero Beach during a 
six-hour period.

Fifty years may seem like a long time for a brain surgeon to toil over one 
head. But not to Dr. Emil Seletz. 
</P>
<P>
That's how long the veteran Los Angeles neurosurgeon has been carving the 
cranium of one of the most celebrated Americans -- Abraham Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Seletz is a self-taught sculptor whose lifelong goal has been to create 
detailed bronze busts of Lincoln. Today he plans to mark the anniversary of the 
16th President's birth in 1809 by working on his grandest Lincoln head yet. It 
is a four-foot replica that he hopes to place in Ford's Theatre in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Seletz, who retired from medical practice three months ago, will also celebrate 
his own birthday today. He plans to spend part of it working in his back-yard 
studio surrounded by 40 other busts of Lincoln he has shaped over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Declining to give his exact age, Seletz said with a grin, "I'm past 75." 
</P>
<P>
The short, courtly Seletz picked up his first glob of modeling clay after he 
spied a bust of Lincoln in the Capitol rotunda during a visit to Washington. He 
was a 23-year-old Philadelphia medical student at the time. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes sparkle as he remembers being left breathless by the beauty of artist 
Gutzon Borglum's work. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply enthralled me. It excited me beyond my ability to express it," 
recalls Seletz. "That head was remarkable. I ran back every holiday to take a 
look at it." 
</P>
<P>
When he could not find a copy of the Lincoln bust to purchase, he set out to 
shape one with his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing medical school and settling in Los Angeles, Seletz created one 
Lincoln head after another. There was Lincoln in Illinois in 1858. Lincoln the 
lawyer. Lincoln in 1860. Lincoln in 1861. Lincoln the President in 1863. A 
tired Lincoln shortly before his assassination in 1865 at Ford's Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporaries of Lincoln described him as homely, even ugly. Seletz disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the most beautiful face I've ever seen," he said. "More beautiful than 
any woman." 
</P>
<P>
Seletz said he has always sought to capture Lincoln's weary compassion in his 
busts, some of which have taken seven years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Between Lincolns, Seletz has done other busts, including studies of medical 
figures and family members, as well as such personalities as Albert Einstein, 
Ludwig van Beethoven and Charles Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
He always returned to Honest Abe, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm a little berserk on the subject," he said, pointing at Lincoln 
heads that have spilled out of his studio and onto a covered patio behind his 
Los Feliz home. "I'm obsessed." 
</P>
<P>
Said his wife of 40 years, Sylvia: "I've learned to live with them." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of his other busts have been placed in schools and at Los Angeles 
County Medical Assn. offices, only two of Seletz's Lincolns are on official 
public display. One is at a courthouse in San Jose. The other is at the Los 
Angeles County Hall of Administration.

FREE CLINIC -- NEW SETTING, SAME MISSION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: THE NATION'S OLDEST NO-COST HEALTH CLINIC WILL MOVE INTO A 
$2.3-MILLION FACILITY ON BEVERLY BOULEVARD. BUT IT IS STILL COMMITTED TO 
SERVING THOSE ON THE ECONOMIC FRINGES OF SOCIETY.

<P>
Working in blue jeans and T-shirts in cramped examination rooms in a dowdy 
brick building, volunteers of the fabled Los Angeles Free Clinic for two 
decades took pride in the scruffy, down-to-earth feel of the place. 
</P>
<P>
What better way to encourage tattered street people and hippie nomads to seek 
health care than to throw off the lab coats, shrug off formalities and pipe in 
rock music of the Love Generation and beyond? 
</P>
<P>
But when the Free Clinic moves today into new $2.3-million quarters three times 
the size of its old building, the homely atmosphere of the nation's oldest 
no-cost health clinic will have headed decidedly uptown. Three stories tall, 
with a glassed-in atrium and walls painted hues of purple heather, the new 
clinic will have bathrooms larger than its old examination rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The new Beverly Boulevard facility will be outfitted with decorator-colored 
dental chairs, an elevator, a board room and a host of expanded facilities that 
reflect the health care demands of the times -- a larger diagnostic laboratory 
with AIDS testing equipment, a shower for the homeless, nine counseling rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1 million clients after it opened in 1967 on Fairfax Avenue to help 
waves of flower children deal with bad drug trips, venereal disease, and birth 
control, the Free Clinic's mission to offer short-term health care to people on 
the economic fringes of society has not changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We will still be very open and accepting," said Mimi West, president of 
Friends of the Los Angeles Free Clinic, a fund-raising organization. "We will 
still serve all parts of the population that have been cut off from health 
care." 
</P>
<P>
What has changed is the clientele. The long lines of barefoot free-spirits -- 
whose care was funded by donations that included a $10,000 gift from Elvis 
Presley -- have given way to those in more desperate need. The Free Clinic now 
caters primarily to homeless people, runaway youths, minimum-wage workers, 
prostitutes and non-English-speaking clients. 
</P>
<P>
"The hippies lived their life styles by choice, coming to us when they ran into 
difficulties," said Gary Bess, the Free Clinic's executive director. "But now 
we are seeing increasing numbers of throwaway kids, homeless and victims of 
domestic violence, none of whom have chosen their situations. We are also 
seeing a lot of working poor who simply can't afford health care." 
</P>
<P>
The new facilities will allow the clinic to increase by half the number of 
patients it sees, but with demand for free health care at an all-time high, 
clinic volunteers still expect an overflow of clients. Between 1985 and 1987, 
the last year the clinic operated in a single location, the annual patient load 
jumped from 19,843 to 22,600. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the building is already too small," Bess said, estimating that 
the clinic will have to continue turning at least one person away for every 
person served. Even as plans are under way for the new building's grand-opening 
celebration, the Free Clinic's board of directors is seeking a Hollywood site 
for its first branch office. 
</P>
<P>
A list of the concerns addressed by the clinic's programs reads like an 
encyclopedia of modern social ills: AIDS, teen-age pregnancy, mentally ill 
homeless people, battered spouses and malnourished runaways. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic moved to the Beverly Boulevard site in 1975, after outgrowing its 
first modest home on Fairfax Avenue. Since 1988, when the existing building was 
bulldozed and construction began on the new building, the clinic has operated 
out of donated quarters in several local outpatient facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Early volunteers at the clinic were mostly caring peers with little medical or 
counseling education. But since it has developed a reputation as a national 
model for such programs, the Free Clinic now draws established professionals 
and graduate medical students who need experience. All the physicians, nurses 
and technicians who work at the clinic are professionals who volunteer their 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Full of the optimism that has kept the nation's oldest free clinic in business, 
supporters say the added space and facilities will bring in even more 
volunteers -- already there are more than 400. "We'll have more than the 
thousand points of light right here in the building," West said. "The 
volunteers who love and know the clinic will maintain the looseness." 
</P>
<P>
Expanded services that the clinic has added over the years include legal and 
psychological counseling, treatment for victims of domestic abuse and AIDS 
education. Because of a flurry of agencies now specializing in drug counseling, 
the clinic refers most drug problems to specialists. 
</P>
<P>
New needs appear every year, and the Free Clinic has prided itself on its quick 
adaptability. In fiscal year 1988-89, for example, volunteers saw 771 people 
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome testing and counseling. Increasingly, 
the clinic has offered ongoing mental health counseling to homeless people, 
legal services to victims of domestic violence and financial counseling for 
AIDS patients who have exhausted their bank accounts fighting the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"This agency by nature is evolutionary. Even while building the new clinic, we 
have suddenly had to run around and find out where to put new things," such as 
a shower for homeless people, said Joel Schwartz, president of the clinic's 
Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The new Free Clinic has seven examination rooms, nine counseling rooms and a 
separate area for dental care. It has an expanded diagnostic laboratory to test 
urine and blood, more and larger bathrooms and parking for volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, photographs that volunteers saved of the old building show a 
resourceful use of cramped space: Technicians performed tests in a lab the size 
of a large broom closet, and tables in tiny examination rooms were hemmed in by 
sinks and instrument trays. 
</P>
<P>
Though the new building looks like a New Age, upscale physician's office, 
supporters say the tenets of the original, ragtag Free Clinic will remain 
intact. Confidentiality, and even anonymity where AIDS is concerned, will still 
be the law of the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of our whole philosophy is that we are non-judgmental: You can come in a 
three-piece suit or holey jeans, and it does not matter," said West. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic now draws much of its financial support from past clients, more than 
a few of them former bead-strung hippies who now have established careers, West 
said. The $2.3 million needed to build the new clinic was raised entirely from 
private sources, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Clinic has also received the attention of numerous celebrities and 
politicians over the years. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) is slated to 
appear at the clinic's "grand reopening" ceremony in April, and Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley has made annual contributions since he first toured the 
clinic as a councilman in 1971.

GENE FOUND TO SUPPRESS PROSTATE CANCER GROWTH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The retinoblastoma gene, the prototype member of a family of so-called 
anti-oncogenes that protect against certain types of cancer, can suppress 
growth of prostate cancer cells, UC San Diego researchers reported in Science 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The gene had previously been reported to have the same effect in retinoblastoma 
-- a rare tumor of the eye -- breast cancer, bone cancer and small-cell lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The gene's effectiveness in controlling growth of cultured prostate tumor cells 
suggests that it and related genes play a major role in protecting humans from 
cancer. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. The discovery "gives 
us insight into genetic events related to prostate cancer, of which we know 
very little," said UCSD molecular biologist Robert Bookstein, who authored the 
report along with Wen-Hwa Lee and their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of the RB gene to suppress several types of tumor growth suggests 
that each of the 100 types of cancer may have a gene equivalent to the RB gene 
that protects against it. Researchers hope eventually to be able to insert the 
RB gene into tumors to halt their growth.

SEX DETERMINANT: HYPOTHESIS THAT WENT WRONG; 
</P>
<P>
GENETICS: THEORY ON WHAT MAKES BOYS OR GIRLS WAS SO GOOD THAT IT WAS TAKEN AS 
FACT BY MANY UNTIL FURTHER RESEARCH FOUND TOO MANY LOOPHOLES.

<TEXT>
<P>
On the corner of Dr. David Page's desk rests a foot-high stack of newly 
published genetics textbooks. They matter-of-factly describe the location of 
the sex-determining factor, the single gene that settles the question of 
whether a fertilized egg will be a boy or a girl. 
</P>
<P>
The gene was Page's discovery. Its rapid rise to the status of accepted wisdom 
is hardly a surprise, for when he revealed it at a news conference, the 
announcement was a major event in the world of genetics. 
</P>
<P>
Isolating the gene was a milestone in basic biology, the prize in an exhausting 
race and the kind of achievement on which distinguished careers are built, 
clearly a breakthrough in a field that uses the word sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
The story was simple: One tiny bit of genetic code rules gender. If we have it 
at the moment we are conceived, we will be male. If not, we'll be female. 
</P>
<P>
Just two years after Page's announcement, the precise location of the 
sex-determining factor is a mystery again. The gene he found, while interesting 
and probably important, is almost certainly not it. 
</P>
<P>
The case illustrates the skittish and often whimsical way science moves. Rather 
than flowing forward in a neat, sane way, facts -- and theories cobbled 
together to fit them -- emerge in a jerky tango of discovery and setback. A new 
set of lab results can turn breathtaking insight to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Page is a staff scientist at the Whitehead Institute, an elite center for 
genetics research across the street from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
While still in training at MIT, he used to smile at a cartoon on a biology 
professor's door: "Theory, like mist on eyeglasses, obscures vision." 
</P>
<P>
Page's theory, accepted by many, is now in a shambles. But it is not the first 
time people have been wrong about the location of the sex-determining factor. A 
decade ago, many believed it was a gene called H-Y, and some textbooks still 
state this unequivocally. 
</P>
<P>
Page's quest to find the sex switch began in 1982. Like others, he tried to 
track it down by a process of elimination. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes. Two of these, 
called X and Y, are the sex chromosomes. Women have two Xs, while men have an X 
and a Y. Scientists reason that the gene that makes men different from women 
must be located someplace on the Y. 
</P>
<P>
Page and others have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the rule, so-called 
XX males. To all outward appearances, these people are physically normal men. 
But their cells contain the double Xs of women. Through a genetic mix-up, one 
of their Xs contains a tiny fragment of Y, enough to make them men. 
</P>
<P>
Among those he studied was an XX man with just half of 1% of a Y chromosome. 
Within this bit of DNA he found a gene that was shared by other XX males. He 
postulated this was TDF, testis-determining factor -- the sex switch. 
</P>
<P>
His description of the gene and his idea of what it did were published in 
December, 1987, in the journal Cell. It was a depressing moment for Dr. Peter 
N. Goodfellow at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London, whose team was 
just a few months from making the same discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Page was almost certain he had correctly identified TDF but remembers feeling 
uneasy when colleagues flashed slides during lectures that confidently called 
it that. "You try as hard as you can to say that something is a working 
hypothesis, and it gets boiled down, even in a textbook, to established fact." 
</P>
<P>
To be on the safe side, he named his gene ZFY, or Y-linked zinc finger protein, 
a reference to the kind of chemical structure it makes. Then he and other 
scientists searched for evidence that ZFY is TDF. But when new pieces of the 
puzzle emerged, they did not quite fit. 
</P>
<P>
"If you get something that is right, more and more things start clicking into 
place," Goodfellow said. "What happened with the ZFY story is that it didn't 
get stronger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Among the conflicting details: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Page knew from the start that there was a related gene on the X chromosome. 
But when its structure was decoded, it was disquietingly like ZFY. If ZFY is 
uniquely male, why would females have a very similar gene? 
</P>
<P>
* All mammals have their own version of ZFY. But among the marsupials, such as 
kangaroo, the gene is not on the Y chromosome at all; it lies on one of the 
non-sex chromosomes that presumably has nothing to do with sex determination. 
</P>
<P>
* Other XX males turned up who did not carry ZFY. 
</P>
<P>
* In mouse embryos, the gene did not seem to be doing anything at the time when 
sex is determined. 
</P>
<P>
* Efforts to transplant ZFY into female embryos did not produce male mice. 
</P>
<P>
Alone, any of these tidbits could be explained away. Maybe the male mouse 
embryos were not producing the ZFY protein because scientists were looking for 
it after the gene had already turned itself on and off. Maybe marsupials and 
their distant relatives among placental mammals have simply evolved different 
means of sex determination. Together, though, the tidbits raised doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"As the data accumulated, it seemed to be more and more puzzling how it could 
be the sex-determining gene," said Benjamin Lewin, editor of Cell. 
</P>
<P>
The breaking point for Page's model came with a paper in December in the 
journal Nature. Goodfellow had found four XX males who carried a bit of the Y 
chromosome, but not the part with ZFY on it. He argued that somewhere in the 
fragment they shared was the true sex-determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
While Page was unmoved by the earlier skepticism over ZFY, Goodfellow's 
discovery was a shock. "It hit me, sure, in part because I did not know this 
was coming until it was published." He could dismiss the other evidence as 
circumstantial, but Goodfellow had used precisely the same line of reasoning to 
attack ZFY's role as Page had used to support it. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes it clear that ZFY is not the only sex-determining function on the 
Y," Page said. "It's possible that ZFY has little, if anything, to do with sex 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
Goodfellow is not gloating. If he had found ZFY first, he said, he would have 
written the paper Page wrote.

BELL LABS CONFIRM QUASI-CRYSTAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists peering at atomic structures through a super-powerful microscope 
have taken the first clear look at the quasi-crystal. AT&amp;T's Bell 
Laboratories said last week their research shows that quasi-crystals have an 
arrangement of atoms with multi-faceted symmetry, which many scientists doubted 
could happen. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said X-rays and other techniques had pretty much proven the 
existence of quasi-crystals, but Bell Labs' research showed them with unmatched 
clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Labs provided the first surface glimpse of a quasi-crystal, helping refute 
arguments that previous manifestations were a quirk of nature, said Lionel 
Kimmerling, director of Bell Labs' materials interface research department in 
Murray Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Labs used a scanning-tunneling microscope, which is exact enough to probe 
individual atoms. Researchers cut atoms on a plane and used the microscope to 
sweep a fine-tipped probe over the surface. The image of each atom was then 
projected on a TV screen.

DEFECT TIED TO ANESTHESIA DEATHS

<P>
Scientists report they have zeroed in on a genetic defect that appears to 
underlie life-threatening reactions to anesthesia, findings that may lead to 
better tests to avert anesthesia-related deaths. Two research teams, working 
independently, said they have narrowed down the location of the gene for 
inherited malignant hyperthermia -- one of the major causes of death from 
anesthesia -- to chromosome 19. 
</P>
<P>
In two articles published in the journal Nature, one team from Ireland's 
University College, Germany's University of Munich and London's St. Mary's 
Hospital and another group from the University of Toronto said they have found 
genetic markers that appear linked to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, or 
MHS.

BOXING: WBA, WBC "SUSPEND RECOGNITION" OF DOUGLAS AS HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION, PLAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-three years after Gene Tunney benefited from a "long count" to defeat 
Jack Dempsey, boxing has another such incident to debate. 
</P>
<P>
Video replays show that James (Buster) Douglas was down, by stopwatch timing, 
from 13.52 seconds to 13.65 seconds in the eighth round of his heavyweight 
championship fight against champion Mike Tyson Sunday afternoon. Douglas went 
on to knock Tyson out in the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
What happens now? No one had any idea late Sunday night in Tokyo, as the heads 
of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Assn. met to resolve the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC and WBA said their executive committees would meet in a week to 10 days 
to decide the issue, and both agreed to "suspend recognition" of Douglas as 
champion until then. 
</P>
<P>
The only group in Tokyo that certified Douglas as the winner was the Japan 
Boxing Council. "We recognize Buster Douglas as champion, and the referee's 
count as official," said Kojima Shigeru, JBC president. 
</P>
<P>
The New Jersey-based International Boxing Federation, which was not represented 
in Tokyo because it isn't recognized by the Japan Boxing Council, will 
recognize Douglas as champion. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have to recognize Douglas," said Robert Lee, IBF president, by 
phone from Fanwood, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas won the fight in the ring. If there's going to be a change, we would 
have to review tapes and Tyson would have to request a reversal. 
</P>
<P>
"All Douglas has to do (during the knockdown) is get up before the 10 count and 
he did that. If the clock is broken or the referee makes a mistake. . . . 
that's not his (Douglas') fault." 
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier in the week that Tyson's IBF title wasn't at stake 
because of the IBF-Japan feud, but Lee said Sunday his organization sanctioned 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible the heavyweight championship could be declared vacant and Tyson 
and Douglas ordered to stage a rematch. But if that happens, Evander 
Holyfield's manager, Ken Sanders, might sue everyone in sight. His fighter has 
been rated the No. 1 contender for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd still prefer to fight Tyson June 18, because we'd make more money," 
Sanders said. "But we'd fight Douglas, if we had to. But what I don't want to 
have happen is for these two guys to have a rematch. We've waited too long 
already." 
</P>
<P>
But that's exactly what will happen, according to Jose Sulaiman, WBC president. 
He said a rematch is "absolutely mandatory." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the referee in the Dempsey-Tunney fight, who handled his problem 
correctly, Octavio Meyran of Mexico mishandled this one completely. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, hurt and on the verge of being knocked out, landed a desperation right 
uppercut late in the eighth round and dumped the challenger on his back. At 
that point, Meyran was supposed to look at the ringside timekeeper and pick up 
his official count. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Meyran never looked at the white-gloved timekeeper who was indicating 
his count with his fingers. As he counted "four," Meyran began his count at 
"two." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Meyran looked around while counting, apparently to see where Tyson was, 
and that may have delayed the count further. Tyson had gone to a neutral corner 
after the knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
In boxing, a 10-count is simply that -- a count. A knockout is not necessarily 
10 seconds, only a human being's 10-count. 
</P>
<P>
More important, through it all, Douglas coolly watched the referee, not the 
timekeeper, and plainly beat the referee's count. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's promoter, Don King, was furious afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"We want what's fair," he said. "Buster Douglas was knocked out." 
</P>
<P>
Meyran, the referee in the famed "no mas" Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran fight 
in New Orleans in 1980, freely admitted his mistake at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
There is little precedent for a major fight result being reversed due to a 
referee's error. In 1987, Tomas Molinares hit Marlon Starling about two seconds 
after the bell ending the sixth round in a welterweight title fight and knocked 
Starling out. 
</P>
<P>
A protest was filed, but the WBA simply ruled "referee error" and the result 
stood. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955, Rocky Marciano was knocked down in the second round by Archie Moore in 
a heavyweight championship fight. The standing-eight count had been waived for 
the fight, but referee Harry Kessler forgot. 
</P>
<P>
He began a standing-eight on Marciano, got to three, remembered there was no 
standing-eight, and motioned the two to resume fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Marciano won the fight on a ninth-round knockout but Moore claims to this day 
that the extra few seconds Kessler gave to Marciano allowed the champion to 
clear his head. 
</P>
<P>
The WBC assigned Meyran to referee the fight, and Sulaiman, called him a solid 
referee. 
</P>
<P>
"Octavio Meyran has been a good referee for 22 years, and he is a man of 
honor," he said. "But he made a 100% human mistake, according to his own 
words." 
</P>
<P>
THE RULE 
</P>
<P>
In boxing, a 10-count is simply that -- a count. A knockout is not necessarily 
10 seconds, only a human being's 10-count. According to WBA rules: When a 
contestant is deemed "down," the referee shall order the opponent to retire to 
the farthest corner of the ring . . . and immediately assume counting from the 
timekeeper. WBC rules are clear in regard to sending a boxer to a neutral 
corner, but do not specify the roles of the timekeeper and referee in the 
count. 
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Boxing's memorable Long Count bout occurred during the heavyweight fight 
between Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney at Soldier Field in Chicago Sept. 22, 
1927. 
</P>
<P>
After Tunney was knocked down in the seventh round, referee Dave Barry refused 
to begin a count over Tunney until Dempsey went to a neutral corner. 
</P>
<P>
It was a costly mental lapse by Dempsey. The rule that a fighter has to go to a 
neutral corner after a knockdown was new at the time and Dempsey simply forgot. 
</P>
<P>
Studies later showed that Tunney was down for well over 10 seconds. Tunney got 
up and went on to win a decision.

MIKE DOWNEY: EARMARKS ARE LONG, POINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don King, the man with the cauliflower head, has done it again. 
</P>
<P>
Who else could turn tragedy into comedy, failure into triumph, nothing into 
something? Only you, Don. Who else could get away with insisting that his boxer 
knocked out another boxer before the other boxer knocked out his boxer? Only 
you, Don. Who else could make us feel sorry for the new heavyweight champion of 
the world? Only you, Don, you large furry fuzzball. Only you. 
</P>
<P>
Let's hear it, then. Ten rounds of applause for Don King, the donkey king. This 
is without a doubt the best thing to happen to heavyweight boxing since the 
1970s. Don, you have done more for your favorite sport in the last day and a 
half than you did in the last 10 years. Go ahead, get out those hedge-clippers, 
trim those weeds, give yourself a pat on the head. 
</P>
<P>
You've got everybody talking about boxing again, in the bars and in the barber 
shops, in the papers and on the box. You've got people actually thinking about 
spending money on boxing again, at a time when boxing's stock should have been 
hitting rock bottom. You've got opponents standing in line now to fight your 
client, less than 36 hours after seeing him take the most terrible beating of 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, Don. 
</P>
<P>
Before, you were so desperate for opposition that you talked about arranging a 
scuffle between the heavyweight champion of the real world and Hulk Hogan, the 
wrestler-slash-actor. You were so starved for attention, you even talked about 
putting your 23-year-old lethal weapon into a ring with George Foreman, a bald, 
41-year-old fat man. 
</P>
<P>
We knew you'd come up with something else eventually, Don. You haven't come 
this far to let a little thing like a knockout stop you. 
</P>
<P>
You took Mike Tyson away from his handlers. Smart. You took Tyson to Tokyo. 
Even smarter. You took Tyson by the hand and steered him into a ring occupied 
by one James (Buster) Douglas, the No. 1 contender in the latest ring rankings 
from Mad magazine. Extremely smart. Give the whole world a show. Introduce the 
Far East to Mr. Mike Tyson, the Occidental tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that was nothing compared to what you accomplished over the weekend, Don, 
you devil. 
</P>
<P>
With one stroke of mad genius, you turned the greatest upset in the history of 
boxing into your latest promotional venture, The Gyp in Japan. We can expect 
T-shirts and satin jackets in the mail, any hour now. 
</P>
<P>
You actually succeeded in making some people believe that Buster Douglas didn't 
really beat Mike Tyson, even though Buster socked the little sucker halfway to 
Osaka. You actually made some people believe that the only way anybody could 
have beaten Tyson was to cheat him with a long count, even though Douglas 
clearly knelt there with a clear head, waiting for the referee to reach "nine" 
so he could get back up on his feet and fight. 
</P>
<P>
Shrewd, Don. 
</P>
<P>
You made people want to see an immediate rematch between your client, Tyson, 
and the new champion, rather than a bout between the champ and the perfectly 
worthy No. 1 contender, Evander Holyfield. You even created a gate for fights 
we never wanted to see, like the one between Tyson and Donovan (Razor) Ruddick 
that was earmarked for Edmonton, Canada, but was postponed due to Tyson's 
sudden and mysterious illness. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, if Buster can beat Tyson, maybe Razor can, too, right, Don? (C'mon, 
whisper those romantic three little words: "Pay per view.") 
</P>
<P>
You are wise beyond your ears, Don. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, you're so smart, you're even outsmarting yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Because if you think the general public can't see through this smokescreen of 
yours, you're nuts. You've got bats in your plush-carpeted belfry. The public 
knows who won the fight. The public knows who's the heavyweight champion of the 
world now. The public wants -- but doesn't expect -- you to be gracious enough 
to bow before Buster Douglas, hail him as champ and beg him to give Tyson a 
title shot, the same way Tyson gave him one. 
</P>
<P>
Buster won the fight, fair and square. The only crime or misdemeanor committed 
in Tokyo that night was the distinct possibility that the judges would have 
awarded a decision to Tyson had he been able to stay on his feet. Yet by the 
time Don King gets through with this thing, he will have people believing that 
it was Douglas who landed a lucky punch after taking savage punishment from 
Tyson for 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Smooth, Don. 
</P>
<P>
Just one thing: You're in danger of making a fool out of Mike Tyson, rather 
than just making a fool out of yourself. We may not have always liked Mike's 
occasional misconduct, his automobile run-ins or his dangerous liaison with 
Robin Givens, but at least we respected his professional stature. Thanks to 
you, though, Don, some of us today wonder whether Tyson would rather take a 
miserable win than accept an honorable loss. 
</P>
<P>
You don't care, do you, Don? We talked boxing yesterday; we're talking boxing 
today; we'll be talking boxing tomorrow. Life is good.

JACKIE ROBINSON: SIMPLY A GREAT ATHLETE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE MAY BE BEST KNOWN FOR BREAKING THE COLOR LINE, BUT HE IS ALSO 
REMEMBERED FOR HIS TREMENDOUS ABILITIES IN MANY SPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK BALOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In today's sports world, fans thrill to Eric Dickerson cutting-back off-tackle 
and Jerry Rice making fingertip catch behind a startled secondary. 
</P>
<P>
They applaud Ozzie Smith as he darts into the hole for a backhand stop and 
Kevin Mitchell when he clouts the ball into the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
And they marvel as Magic Johnson drives by a muscling Moses Malone. The black 
athlete is an obvious force. It was not always so. At one time the black man 
was welcome only in track and boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Then a husky, superlative athlete signed a Montreal baseball contract in 1945. 
Jack Roosevelt Robinson turned it around in an adventure that aroused the 
spirit of his race and opened the eyes of whites throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The country came out of World War II looking for escape from the four-year 
torment of global war. The black was looking for a chance to better his lot. 
And Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was looking for a 
pennant. Rickey had scouts beating the bushes in Puerto Rico, Central America 
and throughout the Negro leagues. No black had played in the major leagues 
since 1888. They were an untapped source of talent. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger scouts thought the great Satchel Paige and power-hitting Josh Gibson 
were too old. Roy Campanella and Monte Irvin lacked the maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The scouts agreed Robinson, a four-sport letterman at UCLA before the war, was 
the man to face the unbelievable pressure of breaking the color barrier. Scout 
Wid Matthews watched Robinson play with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Robinson can protect the strike zone better than any other young 
ballplayer I've ever seen," Matthews reported. 
</P>
<P>
That helped to sell Rickey, who met with Robinson in Brooklyn on Aug. 28, 1945. 
It was a rough one-on-one conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The executive explained he planned to break the color line and wanted Jackie to 
be his man. 
</P>
<P>
"But do you have the courage?" Rickey asked. "When the opposition calls you 
'black son-of-a-bitch' and 'black bastard'; when they try to spike you; when 
they throw at you, do you have guts enough not to fight back?" 
</P>
<P>
Jackie listened, stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you this," Rickey continued. "What would you do if a ballplayer 
made sexual remarks about you and your mother?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'd kill him!" Robinson exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"No, No!" Rickey bellowed. He emphasized the only way to succeed was by Jackie 
"turning the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
"A fight is what the bigots would want," Rickey said. "They'd claim whites and 
blacks couldn't play on the same field without the threat of a riot and it 
would be years before we could try again." 
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed on the path of non-violence and Jackie signed with the 
Dodger farm club at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiery, competitive Robinson, it would be his toughest battle. But for 
Jackie, it was never easy. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Cairo, Ga., on Jan. 31, 1919, the youngest of five children. His 
father deserted the family when Jackie was 6 months old. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1920, his mother headed to California with her brood. There 
she would support the family on the $8 a week she earned as a maid. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinsons lived on Pepper Street in Pasadena, where Jackie became am 
athletic legend. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Jackie's older brother, Mack, who was the family's first 
sports star. Mack finished second to Jesse Owens in the 200- meter dash at the 
1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie was a heralded all-around athlete at Muir High school in Pasadena, 
winning letters in football, basketball, baseball and track. 
</P>
<P>
He was the catcher on Muir's baseball team in 1937. Jackie joined outfielder 
Ted Williams of San Diego Hoover and third baseman Bob Lemon of Long Beach 
Wilson on the Pomona tournament all-star squad. 
</P>
<P>
At Pasadena Junior College he led his football team to 11 consecutive victories 
in 1938. Jackie scored two touchdowns and passed for another in a thrilling win 
over Compton College at the Rose Bowl. Edwin (Duke) Snider was among the 40,000 
fans in attendance that day. 
</P>
<P>
The Duke, later to be Jackie's teammate with the Dodgers, recalled with a 
chuckle of admiration Robinson's exploits at Pasadena JC. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie was great in football, basketball and baseball," said Snider. "He could 
have been a pro in all three sports. 
</P>
<P>
"On a punt return against Compton, he reversed his field three times. Everybody 
on the field took a shot at him, but nobody could touch him. He was something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
On May 8, 1938, Robinson performed two feats usually reserved for pulp fiction. 
</P>
<P>
At a track meet in Claremont he won the long jump with a leap of 25-6 1/2 to 
break his brother Mack's national junior college record. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie then hustled to a waiting car, which headed for a Glendale baseball 
diamond. He arrived in the third inning, entered the lineup at shortstop, and 
paced his Pasadena Junior College team to a 5-3 victory for the Southern 
California junior college baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the long jump at Pasadena City College, Robinson ran a 9.7 100, a 21.5 
220, a 48.5 440; he pole-vaulted 13 feet, had a 23.7 mark for the 220 low 
hurdles and ran on the 440 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged more than 25 points a game in basketball during his two years at 
Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
The first time he attempted golf, 1,000 people watched Robinson break 90 at 
Pasadena's Brookside Park. 
</P>
<P>
In tennis, badminton and Ping-Pong, Jackie competed aggressively against 
Pasadena's Dave Freeman, who became the world's badminton champion. 
</P>
<P>
And Robinson was a quick and talented boxer. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie was awarded a partial scholarship to UCLA when he decided to attend 
college near his family. 
</P>
<P>
He remains UCLA's only four-sport letterman with monograms in football, 
basketball, baseball and track. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was college football's leading ground gainer in 1939, averaging 11.4 
yards-a-carry and returning punts for a 16.4-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Teamed with Kenny Washington, he drove the Bruins to within two yards of 
victory over USC and a trip to the Rose Bowl. The 1939 USC-UCLA game ended in a 
0-0 tie, however, and the Trojans received the bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
The late Cotton Warburton, one of USC's famed backs of yesteryear, called 
Robinson the most exciting back he ever saw. And he watched most of the Trojan 
greats, including Frank Gifford, Jon Arnett, Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie was quick and fast," Warburton said. "Coach Jones (USC Coach Howard 
Jones) would put his best defensive man on Robinson telling the defender to 
tackle him whether he had the ball or not." 
</P>
<P>
On the basketball court, Jackie led the southern division of the Pacific Coast 
Conference in scoring for two years. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the winning basket in an upset of Cal, and scored 23 points against 
highly ranked Stanford during the 1940 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In 1941, Jackie closed out his college career with 20 points against USC, but 
the Bruins dropped a 57-52 decision. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the 1940 NCAA long jump with a leap of 24 feet 10 1/4 inches 
indoors at the University of Minnesota field house. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, baseball was his weakest sport. He batted under .200 as a Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtely the highlight of Jackie's college life was meeting Rachel Isum, the 
woman who would become his wife. She was an honor student majoring in nursing 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A refined, pretty woman, Rachel had no interest in sports . . . until she dated 
Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Years later he remarked, "Rachel was the most important, helpful and 
encouraging person I met in my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
They were married shortly after Jackie signed with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
When his college athletic eligibility ended, Jackie left school and took a job 
with the National Youth Administration to help support his mother. He also 
played professional football with the Los Angeles Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
With the outbreak of World War II, Robinson entered officer candidate school at 
Ft. Riley, Kansas. Actually, OCS was closed to blacks at Ft. Riley. But through 
the intervention of Joe Louis, Jackie was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
In the service his biggest battle was against bigotry. After Robinson was 
commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant, he became morale officer of a Negro truck 
battalion. 
</P>
<P>
In that capacity he phoned the provost marshall, Major Hafner, and stated a 
half-dozen seats in the PX were not enough for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The major told him things would remain as they were. 
</P>
<P>
Hafner than reportedly asked Jackie over the phone, "Lt. Robinson, how would 
you like your wife sitting next to a (black)?" Except Hafner didn't say 
"black." He used a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie exploded. The battalion commander supported Robinson. Hafner was 
reprimanded, Jackie commended and the PX seating arrangement changed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson quit the Ft. Riley football team when he was suddenly granted a 
two-week leave before a game with the University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri had notified military authorities it would not compete against a squad 
with a black athlete. Robinson wanted no part of a team that would bow to 
racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
At Camp Hood, Tex., Jackie refused to move to the back of a bus. The custom was 
in direct violation of a federal ruling against segregated buses on army posts. 
</P>
<P>
The incident led to court-martial proceedings against Jackie with charges that 
he was insolent and impertinent to a military police officer. Robinson was 
acquitted, but it was a needless and humiliating incident. 
</P>
<P>
After his discharge, Jackie became basketball coach at Samuel Houston College 
in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He missed competing himself, however, and signed on as shortstop with the 
Kansas City Monarchs for $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson batted .345 for Kansas City in 1945. It was here he was so carefully 
scouted by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
When he donned a Montreal uniform in 1946, Jackie captivated the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game he became an instant star. Jackie led the Royals to a 14-1 
victory over Jersey City. He played second base and batted second in the Royal 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson banged out four hits in five trips to the plate with three singles and 
a home run. 
</P>
<P>
He stole second twice and scored four runs -- two of which came when the 
pitcher balked after becoming unnerved by Robinson's dashes down the third base 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Joe Bostic summed up the event by writing in the New York Amsterdam 
News: "The most significant sports story of the century was written into the 
record books today as baseball took up the cudgel for democracy and an 
unassuming but superlative Negro boy ascended to heights of excellence to prove 
the rightness of the experiment. And prove it in the only correct crucible for 
such an experiment -- the crucible of white-hot competition." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Al Campanis was Jackie's double-play partner at Montreal. Campanis, 
who three years ago was forced to resign as Dodger vice president/general 
manager as a result of his remarks about blacks, recalled vividly Robinson's 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie had great athletic aptitude," said Campanis. "I was playing shortstop, 
but I had experience at second base and knew the position. 
</P>
<P>
"The baserunners were going for Jackie as he came across the bag on a double 
play. I worked with him on the rocker step. That's where you hit the bag with 
the left foot, step back on the right and throw to first. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie picked it up in a half-hour. We had another second baseman who needed 
weeks to learn the move. 
</P>
<P>
"Robinson was a big man," Campanis continued. "He weighed 195 at Montreal and 
well over 200 with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"But he was amazingly fast and agile. If he were caught in a rundown, the odds 
were in Jackie's favor to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson took an incredible amount of verbal abuse during the year with 
Montreal, and there was always the beanball. 
</P>
<P>
"You never saw anything like it," said Dixie Howell, the catcher who was 
Robinson's teammate at Montreal and later in Brooklyn. "Every time he came up, 
he'd go down!" 
</P>
<P>
The pressure mounted and Jackie was close to a nervous breakdown during the 
season. But as always, he sucked it up. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to hit .349 and win the International League batting title and most 
valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie then paced Montreal to the Little World Series flag as the Royals downed 
Louisville, four games to two. 
</P>
<P>
Courage is like love -- it must have hope for nourishment -- Napoleon Bonaparte 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was promoted to Brooklyn for the 1947 season. With Eddie Stanky at 
second base for the Dodgers, Jackie opened National League play at first. 
</P>
<P>
Now he faced major league pitching as well as big league bigots. 
</P>
<P>
They called him every slur in the book. 
</P>
<P>
They yelled remarks about his odor. There were hyphenated expressions about his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Fans threw watermelon rinds in his path. Pitchers threw at his head, knees and 
groin. 
</P>
<P>
Baserunners came in with spikes flashing. Infielders tagged him viciously. 
</P>
<P>
It was a 200,000-1 shot for a young man to make it to the major leagues and 
succeed. Jackie Robinson became a star with hatred ringing in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
Young blacks of a later era criticized him for not fighting back. He couldn't. 
His hands were tied. "No fights . . . no brawls" was the agreement with Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, when the pitcher flipped him, Jackie had to get up out of the dirt 
and face the fast ball again, always the tight fast ball. 
</P>
<P>
That first year some of his Dodger teammates asked to be traded. Popular Fred 
(Dixie) Walker was swapped after the 1947 season. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Hal Gregg went to Pittsburgh for left-handed pitcher Preacher Roe 
and third baseman Billy Cox. It was a great trade for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis Cardinals threatened to strike if Robinson played. They backed 
down when league president Ford Frick warned he would suspend any 
trouble-makers. 
</P>
<P>
There was a particularly ugly incident of bench-jockeying in a series with 
Philadelphia. Alabama-born manager Ben Chapman and his Phillies were all over 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Stanky couldn't take it and shouted at the Phillies' bench, "You're all a bunch 
of cowards, picking on a man who can't fight back!" 
</P>
<P>
It might have been the turning point in the season as the Dodgers rallied 
around Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
During that first year -- 1947 -- Robinson won the rookie of the year award, as 
the Dodgers took the National League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .297 with 12 homers in 151 games. Robinson garnered his first of two 
stolen base titles with 29 thefts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948 Jackie replaced Stanky at second base and batted .296. Robinson's top 
year was 1949, when he won the National League's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .342 with 203 hits, 38 doubles, 12 triples, 16 homers, 124 runs 
batted in, and 122 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie's .342 average and 37 stolen bases were league highs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of six straight seasons in which he batted over .300. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn club of the late '40s and early '50s was loaded with talent. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Roy Campanella, who possessed "bleacher power" and outstanding 
defensive skills, was named National League most valuable player in '51, '53 
and '55. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Hodges, a fine fielding first baseman, hit the long ball, particularly in 
Brooklyn's Ebbets Field. From 1949 to 1955 he recorded 100 or more RBIs a 
season and averaged more than 32 home runs a year. 
</P>
<P>
Talented Junior Gilliam broke into the lineup at second base in 1953. 
Thereafter, Robinson split his time between third base and the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Pee Wee Reese became one of Jackie's closest friends on the club. 
Reese, who picked up his nickname for his childhood skill in marbles, ranked 
with contemporaries Marty Marion, Lou Boudreau and Phil Rizzuto as a shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Cox, with the hands of a pickpocket, could be compared with Brooks 
Robinson as a defensive third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Amoros, Gene Hermanski, Andy Pafko and George (Shotgun) Shuba divided 
time in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Center belonged to Hall of Famer Duke Snider, a highly talented fielder who hit 
.259 lifetime and 407 career home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The late Carl Furillo was an outstanding right fielder. Furillo led the 
National League in batting in 1953 with a .344 average. His rifle arm was the 
most accurate in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
On the mound were fireballing Don Newcombe, Ralph Branca, Preacher Roe and Carl 
Erskine, whose overhand curve was the best since Tommy Bridges'. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen boasted hard-throwing relievers Clem Labine and Joe Black. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson was the catalyst. His alert mind, level swing, sure hands and 
agility and daring on the basepaths helped propel the Dodgers to six National 
League pennants from 1947-1956. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1949 campaign, Rickey and Robinson had another meeting. The 
executive said it was time to no longer "turn the other cheek." 
</P>
<P>
There were other blacks in the majors now -- Larry Doby at Cleveland and Roy 
Campanella with the Dodgers. Don Newcombe and the Giants' Monte Irvin were 
coming up in '49. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd been quiet long enough," Rickey said. "Jackie had to show his courage to 
men who only know courage in a physical sense." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson joined Ty Cobb and Pepper Martin as the most exciting and competitive 
players to perform between the white lines. 
</P>
<P>
On the basepaths there might never have been anyone so unnerving. As a runner 
he had a quick start -- a carry-over from his days as a track star. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie had dancing moves off the bag. By the third step he was in full stride. 
He had the ability to look back over his shoulder without losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
What was really a show was when Jackie reached third base. He stole home 19 
times, and once in World Series play (Sept. 28, 1955 against the Yankees). 
</P>
<P>
On third, he'd be a constant threat to the pitcher. He'd dash halfway home 
during the windup and still hustle back to third to beat a throw from the 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson even amazed his teammates with his daring. Once he scored all the way 
from first base on a sacrifice fly by Gene Hermanski. And he was a master of 
the slide. 
</P>
<P>
At bat Jackie overcame "football shoulders," once pointed out by Bob Feller, 
who claimed Robinson couldn't get around on the fast ball. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie held the bat uncommonly high with wrists not far from his right ear. 
Hall of Famer George Sisler taught him to hit to right field during the '49 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
During his later years with the Dodgers he batted clean-up. He had average 
power, but he was a true clutch hitter with fine bat control on the bunt. The 
threat was always there that he would put the ball down. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949 the Dodgers were back in the World Series. Once again they were beaten 
by the Yankees as they would be in five of the six World Series in which Jackie 
competed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson played only one game -- in 1953 -- at shortstop in his major league 
career. His arm wasn't strong enough for the position. 
</P>
<P>
He played 197 games at first, 751 at second, 256 at third and 152 in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing that impressed everyone was Jackie's constant hustle. And nothing 
pointed that up more than the Dodger nightmare year of 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn blew a 13 1/2-game lead and lost the flag to the Giants in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Few remember, though, that the Dodgers were fortunate to get in that playoff. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers and Giants were tied on the last day of the campaign and the 
Dodgers were at Shibe Park in Philadelphia for a game with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard showed the Giants beat Boston, 3-2, to move one-half game ahead. 
The Dodgers needed a win to make a playoff necessary. And it was Robinson who 
almost single-handedly got it for them. 
</P>
<P>
He made a diving catch over second base of a liner off Eddie Waitkus' bat to 
get Don Newcombe out of trouble in the 12th inning of an 8-8 tie. In the 
process, Jackie's elbows were jammed into his body and he lost consciousness 
for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie refused to leave the game and with two out in the 14th inning, he 
clouted a home run off Robin Roberts to earn Brooklyn a 9-8 decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and Dodgers split the first two games of the playoff. Bobby 
Thomson's dramatic 315-foot, three-run homer off Ralph Branca in the last of 
the ninth of the third game gave the Giants an unbelievable pennant. 
</P>
<P>
The Giant fans in the Polo Grounds went wild. The Dodgers walked slowly off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Only Jackie remained. With hands on hips he watched to see that Thomson touched 
every base. Then Robinson turned and in his familiar pigeon-toed gait moved 
toward the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Jackie was reduced to 105 games and he batted .256, but this was the 
year the Dodgers finally beat the Yankees in seven games for the World 
Championship. Johnny Podres spaced eight hits and the Dodgers topped the 
Yankees, 2-0, in the decider. 
</P>
<P>
By 1956 Jackie was clearly slowing down. He batted .275 with 10 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was traded to the hated Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 on 
Dec. 13, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackie wanted to spend more time with his wife and three children and he 
announced his retirement on Jan. 5, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of baseball his interests varied. Jackie worked for a restaurant chain 
in New York and was a major spokesman in the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
He became involved in politics and assisted New York Governor Nelson 
Rockefeller. He also did frequent radio and television work including 
baseball's Game of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, his first year of eligibility, Jackie was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was beset with personal problems. Jackie Jr. picked up a drug habit in 
Vietnam. When he had the addiction beaten, the young Robinson was killed in an 
auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie himself suffered from diabetes and he had a heart attack in 1968. By 
this time the once great athlete walked with a cane and his sight was failing. 
</P>
<P>
At the opening same of the 1972 World Series Jackie made a rare appearance when 
he was honored by the sport on which he left an indelible mark. 
</P>
<P>
Only weeks later, on Oct. 24, 1972, he died at age 53. The diabetes and the 
inner conflict of his first three years in baseball took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime he touched many people in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
That first year in the majors -- 1947 -- he was voted runner-up to Bing Crosby 
as the most popular man in America in a poll. He had more than 5,000 social and 
commercial requests for personal appearances that year. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist John Crosby called him "the blackest black man, as well as one of the 
handsomest, I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
President Dwight Eisenhower crossed a crowded ballroom to shake Jackie's hand 
at a black-tie affair. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball people saw him as a multi-talented competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"He was tough, intelligent and proud," Dodger scout Clyde Sukeforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner, who is now a broadcaster for the New York Mets, 
emphasized, "Robinson was the only player I ever saw who could completely turn 
a game around by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"His ability to run the bases, to intimidate the pitchers, to take the extra 
base, to hang in there under the worst kind of pressure made him antagonize the 
opposition to the benefit of his own team." 
</P>
<P>
Campanella said, "I never saw a ballplayer who could do all the things Jackie 
could. He could think so much faster than anybody I ever played with or 
against. He was two steps and one thought ahead of anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Although Willie Mays of the Giants and Robinson were fierce rivals, they were 
friends off the field. Mays recalled an incident in Ebbets Field when he 
crashed into the wall after catching a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie came running out," Mays said. "He turned me over to see if the ball 
dropped out of my glove." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Duke Snider's story about Sam (Toothpick) Jones, a fine black 
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie was yelling at Jones from the on-deck circle," Snider said. "Jackie 
kept yelling, "Sam, you've got no guts . . . I'm going to beat you."' 
</P>
<P>
"By the time Jackie stepped in, Sam was boiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones hit Jackie with a pitch, then threw the ball into right field when he 
tried to pick Robinson off first. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Jackie's on third taunting Sam and dancing around. Jones was paying more 
attention to Jackie than the batter and he bounced a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie scored on the wild pitch to give us a 3-2 win. Sam nearly swallowed his 
toothpick." 
</P>
<P>
And there were always the confrontations between Giant Manager Leo Durocher and 
Jackie. They were so much alike -- great competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey once maintained Durocher had the uncommon ability to make a bad 
situation infinitely worse. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the bad feeling between Robinson and Durocher stemmed from a play at 
first base when Jackie barrelled over Giant second baseman Davey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams suffered a spinal injury which nearly ended his career. The Giants 
thought it was a cheap shot. Jackie maintained it was part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Durocher, always a dandy but all man, was married to actress Laraine Day. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie would yell from the dugout in his unmistakably high voice, "Leo, lay off 
of Laraine's perfume." 
</P>
<P>
Durocher would retaliate by holding his hands a couple inches from his head, 
alongside his ears, indicating Jackie had a swelled head. 
</P>
<P>
Late in his career Jackie had ballooned up to 230 pounds. Leo was always 
yelling remarks about his size. 
</P>
<P>
They almost went at it a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
Years later Durocher said of Jackie, "He beat me a thousand times in a thousand 
ways -- getting a base hit, making a play, making the double play, hitting the 
home run, stealing a base, stealing home, upsetting my pitcher with his antics 
on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy didn't just come to play. He came to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
He did more than that. His accomplishments transcend baseball -- he showed the 
way for his race.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
The World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Assn. might not know who the 
heavyweight champion is, but the rest of the world does. It's James (Buster) 
Douglas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Taking away Douglas' 10th-round knockout of Mike Tyson because of a long count 
in the eighth round would be like reversing the result of a football game 
because of a call made in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Long count, short count, regular count. It made no difference. The clear-eyed, 
alert Douglas would have gotten up in time because he was watching the referee 
and listening to his count. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was the impartial promoter, Don King, who registered the 
complaint on behalf of Tyson. King's good friend, WBC president Jose Sulaiman, 
quaked in his boots. And the referee, Octavio Meyran, quickly entered a plea of 
guilty. Oh, the shame of it all. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What should have been one of boxing's greatest moments of the century has 
degenerated into still another fiasco. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If anything should be reviewed, it's the cards of the two Japanese judges. One 
had Tyson ahead going into the 10th and the other had it even. The one judge 
who was scoring the fight with his eyes, Larry Rozadilla of Los Angeles, had 
Douglas ahead by six. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Where I watched the bout on HBO, a half-dozen knowledgeable boxing observers 
all had Douglas ahead by anywhere from four to six points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Was this the biggest upset in the history of boxing? No contest. At the Mirage 
Hotel in Las Vegas, Tyson was a 42-1 favorite. According to the Ring Record 
Book, the previous biggest upset in a heavyweight championship bout was 
recorded by James J. Braddock at odds of 10-1 over Max Baer in 1934. Sonny 
Liston was 7-1 over Cassius Clay in their first fight in 1964. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Until Saturday night, I had been most startled by Ingemar Johansson knocking 
Floyd Patterson down, down, down, down, down, down and finally out in the third 
round in 1959 in New York and George Foreman demolishing Joe Frazier in the 
second round in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In a refreshing change from the usual pre-fight hype, HBO announcers Jim 
Lampley and Larry Merchant prepared the viewers for a mismatch. They were 
right. It was a mismatch. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The cable network didn't even bother to bring along the man who keeps its 
unofficial scorecard, former referee Harold Lederman, to Japan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What the telecast needed was some canned yelling and screaming. I've heard more 
noise in a library. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference between the two fighters was conditioning. Douglas had 
the stamina to climb off the canvas from his knockdown. Tyson didn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Douglas also had the good sense not long ago to replace Bill (Dynamite) Douglas 
as his manager. Fathers just don't make good managers of their sons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tyson missed his old trainer, Kevin Rooney, in his corner. For the first time 
in his boxing life, he needed advice. None of any value was forthcoming. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The first defeat may have done irreparable damage to Tyson's psyche. He thought 
he was indestructible and unbeatable. So did his opponents. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Such "invincibles" as George Foreman, Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns were 
never the same after losing for the first time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tyson's late manager, Jimmy Jacobs, knew he needed to fight at least once a 
month on his way up to stay out of trouble. Jacobs never would have allowed him 
this much time between bouts even as champion. Too much partying, too little 
serious training. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tyson looked more disinterested than mean on his way down the aisle and into 
the ring. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent from the first minute that, unlike most of Tyson's other 
opponents, Douglas wasn't intimidated. He stuck out the jab to make use of his 
longer reach and often led with his right to keep Tyson from lunging in with 
the left hook. And he tied up Iron Mike inside, where he still hasn't learned 
how to fight. A terrific plan worked to near perfection. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In victory, Douglas was cocky, but likable. In defeat, Tyson was cowardly, 
hiding from the media. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I would pick Douglas over Evander Holyfield. Too big and too smart. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The economics of the heavyweight division will change drastically. No longer 
will Tyson be able to command outrageous sums of money. But there will be good 
paydays now for him, Douglas, Holyfield and George Foreman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
As far as Busters go, Douglas has passed Mathis and Brown and is second only to 
Keaton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Question of the Day: Who is going to referee the Hulk Hogan-Macho Man Savage 
wrestling match now?

WAY TO A KNOCKOUT BECAME PERFECTLY CLEAR;

<P>
BOXING: DOUGLAS SAYS THE SECRET TO DEFEATING TYSON EMERGED FROM A MOVING 
EXPERIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James (Buster) Douglas, heavyweight champion of the world for the previous 
three hours, lay on a bed in his hotel room Sunday night, serenely enjoying the 
scene swirling around him. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 29, whose career until Sunday afternoon in Tokyo was a symphony in 
mediocrity, seemed to have no difficulty grasping what had happened. He had 
scored the greatest upset in the history of the heavyweight division, a 
10th-round knockout of Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
But as he savored these moments, boxing officials were still meeting at the 
scene of battle, the Tokyo Dome, where it was decided to at least temporarily 
withhold certification of Douglas' stunning triumph. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth round, Douglas had been decked by a Tyson uppercut and Team Tyson 
argued afterward that Douglas had been down for more than 10 seconds, that 
referee Octavio Meyran had started his count two or three seconds late. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Douglas enjoyed the triumph. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't show me any respect, like he didn't think I had a punch," Douglas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 38 fights, it was Mike Tyson, not a fading, fearful 
opponent, who was first hurt and then, finally, on his back. 
</P>
<P>
"I was showing him movement in the early rounds, but after a while I realized I 
could see his shots coming, clearly," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
"So I stopped moving. See, Mike Tyson is vulnerable when he moves in on you, 
winging (punches). If you stay focused, you can see them (punches) coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit him with good shots all night, but he's so strong it took time to wear 
him down. My dad (Billy Douglas, a 1950s and '60s middleweight/light 
heavyweight) always told me that with a big tree, you keep right on chopping, 
because eventually it'll come down." 
</P>
<P>
Some wondered afterward if this was vintage Tyson, if he was properly fit, if 
all those one-round knockouts had diminished his intensity. From the fifth 
round on, Tyson's knees trembled and his legs were unsteady. 
</P>
<P>
One of Tyson's sparring partners, who asked not to be identified, said Tyson 
was over-trained. But J.D. McCauley, Douglas' uncle and trainer, said his 
fighter, not fatigue, put the shakes to Tyson's legs. 
</P>
<P>
"You're missing (the point)," he told a reporter. "Your legs would be shaking, 
too, if you'd taken those shots for five or six rounds. See, Buster's got awful 
quick hands and Mike didn't know that. Buster is basically a big middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told people for 2 1/2 years that Buster would beat Tyson, long before we 
ever got the fight. He matches up perfectly with Mike. You know how Tommy 
Hearns canceled out almost everything Sugar Ray Leonard tried to do with him? 
That's what happened tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's other guys out there who can beat Tyson, too. Razor Ruddock and 
Greg Page can beat him. Those guys are quick, too, with good movement, and 
they're almost as strong as Mike. And Buster will beat him again, too. That was 
not Buster's best fight tonight." 
</P>
<P>
McCauley said he knew Douglas would win the fight after two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He was making Mike eat that big jab with no trouble at all and at that point I 
knew he had him whipped." 
</P>
<P>
It was almost a perfect performance, as Team Douglas saw it, with one 
frightening lapse. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Buster over and over in training, whatever you do, don't lean in on 
the guy when you're close to him," McCauley said. "He got lazy in the eighth 
round and did it, and Mike caught him with that shot." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' manager, one-time Ohio State assistant football coach John Johnson, 
who calls himself "a disciple of Jesus Christ and Woody Hayes," was making 
veiled threats in the event that the WBA and WBC withhold recognition of 
Douglas as champion. 
</P>
<P>
"If they take away from James what he earned tonight, then there's a strong 
possibility that Mike Tyson will never get another fight with James Douglas," 
he said. "If the referee made a mistake, we can't help that." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also derided two Japanese judges, Ken Morita and Masakazu Uchida. After 
nine rounds, Morita had Tyson ahead, 87-86, and Uchida had the fight even, 
86-86. Judge Larry Rozadilla of Los Angeles had Douglas ahead, 88-82. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two (the Japanese judges) should never be allowed to work another 
fight," Johnson said. "Those scorers were a disgrace. I told Buster at one 
point that he'd won every round." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said he never felt certain he would win. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not with this guy," he said. "I knew I was in there with a champion, and I 
expected him to pick up the pace when things got tough for him, and he did, in 
the sixth and seventh. It was like he was saying, 'OK, that's enough of this 
bleep.' At that point, I knew I had to keep the hammers on him." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1987, Douglas had the International Boxing Federation's 
championship in his grasp, against Tony Tucker. He was ahead on points when he 
ran out of steam in the 10th round. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, on the undercard of Tyson's 93-second knockout of Carl Williams, 
Douglas looked dreadful in going 10 rounds with an unknown, Oliver McCall. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said all week here that he had converted personal losses in his life 
into motivating factors. His wife left him last summer and his mother died 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't afraid of Mike Tyson, I'm only afraid of God," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And it was experience, he said, that enabled him to recover quickly from the 
knockdown in the eighth round and turn in a smashing ninth round that softened 
up the champion for the 10th-round knockout. 
</P>
<P>
"My experience took over, knowing how to handle being hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike had never been in that situation before, and he couldn't handle it." 
</P>

BOXING: CABLE NETWORK IS PUTTING TOGETHER A TWO-HOUR SPECIAL, BUT IT PROBABLY 
WON'T BE SHOWN BEFORE FRIDAY.

HBO will replay the Buster Douglas-Mike Tyson fight, but not until the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
The playdate will be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably won't be before Friday," Seth Abraham, HBO senior vice president 
in charge of sports, said Sunday from his home in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"If there had been no controversy, we would probably show the fight (today) or 
Tuesday. But now we want to put on a different type of show than just the 
fight. We'll approach it with a eye toward history, not just an eye toward 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we are a pay network, we don't have advertisers telling us to play it 
right away and get the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Abraham said HBO wants to line up interviews with both fighters, with the 
referee, and possibly others. A two-hour special is being planned. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of logistical work to be done," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
Unless promoter Don King's appeal is upheld, the loss for Tyson means his 
$26.5-million, eight-fight contract with HBO is off. 
</P>
<P>
With two fights remaining on the contract, Tyson will get about $20 million 
from HBO, Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham said he went to the HBO studios Sunday to take a close look at the long 
count in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an engineer slow it down," Abraham said, "and I looked at it over and 
over. No question it was a long count, but no question Buster Douglas could 
have gotten up at any time. He simply took the four extra seconds the referee 
gave him." 
</P>
<P>
On NBC Sunday, sportscaster Bob Costas also put a clock on the 10th-round 
knockout of Tyson. It too had a long count. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights from the fight can't be shown by news outlets for one year because 
HBO owns the delay rights. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, NBC and CNN did show the long count in the eighth round. They got 
it from a news conference held by King Sunday in which he used footage from 
Japanese television to make his point. CNN and NBC simply had a cameraman shoot 
off the video. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't put an iron curtain over the world," Abraham said. 
</P>
<P>
"ESPN and other networks have inquired about a deal for permission to show 
highlights. We said no thank you." 
</P>
<P>
HBO commentator Larry Merchant, after returning home to Santa Monica Sunday, 
said he was simply doing his job when he pressed Douglas for postfight comments 
despite the fighter's emotional state. 
</P>
<P>
"My job was to let him compose himself and for him -- not me -- to decide if he 
wanted to go on," Merchant said. "Knowing him from the past and knowing him to 
be a bright fellow, I felt he would come around, and he did."

ROONEY SAYS TYSON WASN'T READY, PUTS THE BLAME ON DON KING, TRAINERS

Kevin Rooney, Mike Tyson's former trainer, blamed Tyson's showing against 
Buster Douglas on the champion's co-trainers Aaron Snowell and Jay Bright and 
on adviser Don King. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike acted like he didn't want to fight," Rooney said Sunday in Catskill, N.Y. 
"He didn't want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
He allowed Buster Douglas to get brave. I wouldn't have been whispering in his 
ear (as Snowell did between rounds). I would've said, 'Do you want to fight or 
should I throw in the towel?' He wanted to lose. Maybe the pressure was getting 
to him. He was hit more in that fight than in his amateur career through his 
pro career with all the sparring in between. 
</P>
<P>
"Don King is a great con man. He controls everything. Didn't you see Don King 
in the background (after the bout)? While Tyson was in the dressing room, King 
was trying to get close to Buster Douglas. I hear he has five options on 
Douglas. He has ruined a great young career."

FIRST EXECUTIVE'S BOND PORTFOLIO IS AVERAGE JUNK; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: COMPANY PRESIDENT AND CEO FRED CARR USED TO BOAST ABOUT HIS SAVVY 
BOND BUYS. NOW HIS HIGHLY PROFITABLE PORTFOLIO HAS PLUMMETED BY $1.9 BILLION. 
</P>

<P>
Fred Carr was once lauded for providing his insurance company's policyholders 
and shareholders with heady returns through his active and savvy management of 
a massive pool of risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
But an analysis of Carr's investment portfolio reveals that he has done no 
better than the average junk bond buyer -- which is dismal now that the junk 
bond market has gone into the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Carr, president and chief executive of First Executive Corp., has been one of 
the nation's biggest buyers of this high-yield debt since it became popular in 
the early 1980s. He's boasted in the past about cleverness in weeding through 
the issues to pick only the very best bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But, almost overnight, Carr's gone from hero to bum. His company's profits have 
evaporated. His policyholders are abandoning First Executive's operating 
subsidiaries, Executive Life Insurance Co. and Executive Life of New York, in 
droves. And his biggest shareholders are talking about an ouster. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the turnaround? Carr's once highly profitable bond portfolio has 
declined in value by at least $1.9 billion. And the future performance of the 
highly volatile and risky junk bond market is pivotal to the Los Angeles 
insurer's very survival, industry experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two things that can do them in: a large number of defaults in the 
junk bonds they hold or a run on the bank, which would force them to realize 
some of the unrecognized losses in their junk portfolio," said Frederick 
Townsend, president of Townsend &amp; Schupp, a Hartford, Conn., research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Still, according to industry experts and an analysis of a segment of First 
Executive's high-yield bond portfolio by the Los Angeles Times, he's done no 
better or worse than the average junk buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The Times examined Executive Life's investment portfolio, as described in state 
Insurance Department filings and selected a group of 30 bonds in an attempt to 
reflect the overall package, both good and bad. The criteria for choosing the 
bonds was that they are actively traded and purchased by First Executive in 
relatively large quantities. The company's purchases and sales of these 30 
issues were then tracked through the third quarter of 1989, the most recent 
period for which data is available, to determine performance. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the market value of this sample portfolio has slid about 20%, to less 
than $1.1 billion from $1.38 billion. Industry experts caution that the 
company's total portfolio probably would have deteriorated more because this 
analysis does not include rarely traded issues, which generally sell at steeper 
discounts. First Executive has a wide variety of these hard-to-sell bonds, but 
they were not included in the sample because it is virtually impossible to get 
accurate market prices for them. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive has said its total portfolio has declined in value by $1.9 
billion -- roughly a 30% drop. 
</P>
<P>
But a 20% to 30% decline is not unusual these days, said Michael Singer, 
president of R. D. Smith &amp; Co., a New York firm that specializes in buying 
and selling securities issued by troubled companies. Some of the publicly 
traded mutual funds that invest in junk bonds have seen asset values decline as 
much as 40%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive's junk bond portfolio reflects the market as a whole, added 
another industry expert. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't done a particularly bad job or a particularly good job. They've 
just ridden the market down," he said. "I don't believe they've suffered 
disproportionately." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is a far cry from Carr's claims of only six years ago, when he 
was taking bows for First Executive's financial successes and fast growth. At 
the time, Carr maintained that the generous yields on junk bonds were more a 
product of inefficiencies in the marketplace than real credit risk. 
Additionally, he said he was able to wade through the junk issues to find the 
gems. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' review of Executive Life's $10.6-billion bond portfolio revealed a 
number of gems and plenty of junk. 
</P>
<P>
First Executive, through its insurance subsidiaries, has invested heavily in 
now bankrupt companies such as Hillsborough Holdings, Allied Stores, Federated 
Department Stores and Southmark Corp., but it also has bought the securities of 
thriving firms such as Holiday Inns, Viacom and FMC Corp. 
</P>
<P>
To be specific: 
</P>
<P>
* The company assembled a $155.5-million stake in Hillsborough Holdings, a 
bankrupt firm that issued bonds in connection with a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
&amp; Co. buyout of the former Jim Walter Corp. Hillsborough's bonds are now 
worth about 15 cents on the dollar, leaving Executive Life with roughly $116 
million in paper losses. 
</P>
<P>
* It bought $26.75 million of Integrated Resources' debt. Integrated, a 
financial services and limited partnership concern, is now so troubled that its 
debt sells for about 2 cents on the dollar. First Executive's paper losses 
amount to just over $26 million. 
</P>
<P>
* First Executive also snapped up nearly $130 million of E-II Holdings' bonds. 
E-II debt, which is controlled by Meshulam Riklis, now sells for 60 to 65 cents 
on the dollar, even though Riklis has extended a tender offer that would pay 
bondholders slightly more. First Executive's paper losses: about $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, even in the currently depressed junk market, First Executive 
can point to a handful of success stories. 
</P>
<P>
* For example, First Executive spent about $30.4 million on Multimedia Corp. 
bonds. When the insurer bought its stake, Multimedia's debt was depressed, 
selling for about 54 cents on the dollar. It has since recovered, and First 
Executive has a paper profit of about $20 million on the holding. 
</P>
<P>
* It also bought a $108.3-million stake in Holiday Inns' senior notes. Holiday 
has offered to buy back its debt at a premium. First Executive should post a 
$4.3-million profit on the deal. 
</P>
<P>
* The company's $64.9-million holding in Occidental Petroleum's senior 
subordinated notes has also appreciated, although more modestly. It is now 
worth about $670,000 more than First Executive paid. 
</P>
<P>
A number of other issues in First Executive's portfolio are extremely healthy 
and have declined in value only because of the market's malaise, industry 
experts said. If the company can wait to sell these issues until they mature or 
the market recovers, it should do well. Among those issues are Healthtrust 
Hospital Corp., McCaw Cellular, Mattel and Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some big institutional holders of First Executive stock are critical of 
Carr's portfolio management, partly because he acknowledged as much as two 
years ago that the junk bond market was getting overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred has mentioned in many public forums over the past two years that junk 
bonds were overpriced," said the owner of one big East Coast money management 
firm. "But there was no recognition on his part of the desirability of selling 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Now, opportunities to sell the bonds are limited and investors are angry that 
Carr bet the company on such a speculative investment. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they point to Carr's past claims that his active management of the 
portfolio would guide the company through hard times. Carr has also been openly 
critical of other insurers in the past, maintaining that their conservative 
investment philosophies left them with low-yielding securities that, if written 
down to current market values, would wipe out the net worth at a number of 
these companies. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, insurers should trade their investments to generate 
investment gains. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1984 interview with The Times, for example, Carr said: "If your portfolio 
doesn't generate capital gains consistently, if investors are not interested in 
buying what you have, then you are not buying the right things." Capital gains 
are generated when a company sells an investment at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, if Carr were forced to mark his investment portfolio down to 
current market values, it would wipe out First Executive's net worth -- a 
scenario he once described as "not just bad but catastrophic" when speaking of 
his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
And recently, First Executive has been better at damage control than generating 
capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
The company had a $30.1-million stake in Southmark Corp. at year-end 1988, for 
example. But sensing severe problems at the company, First Executive began to 
unload the bulk of its Southmark holdings last year. Southmark filed for 
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, and its bonds now sell for about 16 
cents on the dollar. Although First Executive has recognized losses of about 
$14.5 million on the investment, its losses would have surpassed $25 million 
had it held onto the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The company also sold its Allied Stores senior notes last year, which cut its 
losses to $5.4 million, compared to the potential loss of $8.3 million if those 
bonds were still in its portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, industry experts are uncertain about First Executive's 
future, which they say almost completely hinges on the future performance of 
the junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
"We would still say there is a fairly low chance of a meltdown" at First 
Executive, said Weston Hicks, vice president and associate director of Moody's 
Investors Service in New York. "But that's not to say there is no chance."

Ex-Dokken Members Block Founder: Three members of the now-defunct heavy metal 
rock group Dokken won a preliminary injunction in Superior Court on Thursday 
blocking group founder Don Dokken from using the name Dokken or Dokken II to 
launch a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Zebrowski found that a contract signed by all four band members 
prevents Don Dokken from using his last name on future recordings. The former 
Dokken members, Jeff Pilson of Van Nuys and Mick Brown and George Lynch, both 
of Phoenix, filed the suit in January after learning that Don Dokken was 
preparing to release an album on Geffen Records under the name, Dokken II.

Costner Sues Video Firm: Actor Kevin Costner and Universal Pictures Inc. filed 
suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Monday charging a video firm with 
trying to profit from "Field of Dreams," a hit movie in which Costner starred. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said Prism Entertainment Corp. is distributing videocassettes of a 
1985 film, "Chasing Dreams" in which Costner played a minor role, by linking it 
with "Field of Dreams." Costner and Universal seek to alter the marketing plan 
and collect profits from the sale of Prism's videocassette. (Filed Feb. 5,

Ex-U.S. Official Sues Hughes: A whistle-blower lawsuit was filed in U.S. 
District Court by a former high-ranking government official who oversaw 
contracts at Hughes Aircraft Co. alleging that the company's Ground Systems 
Group in Fullerton overcharged the government by $70 million between 1983 and 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick M. Kelley, former chief of the contracts division for the Pentagon 
office that manages government operations at the plant, filed the suit under 
seal last August. The case was unsealed Jan. 16 and released by Kelley's 
attorney Tuesday. (Filed August 14, 1989, Case No. CV89-4832)

Atari Loses Plea: A U.S. District Court judge denied a request Monday by Atari 
Corp. to force Nintendo of America Inc. to change its advertising for its Game 
Boy portable video game system. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Stephen V. Wilson ruled that Atari did not have enough evidence to 
support its request that Nintendo be restrained from using its current 
advertising and packaging for the video game. He set the case for trial April 
17. (Filed Dec. 7, 1989, Case No. CV89-7071.)

Citrus Damage Estimate Eases: The government said freeze losses in the South 
were not quite as bad as initially thought, but it still listed the citrus crop 
at 9.92 million tons, 23% less than last season. 
</P>
<P>
Orange production was forecast as 169 million boxes, 19% less than last season, 
but 7% more than estimated by the Agriculture Department two weeks after the 
Christmas weekend freeze. Grapefruit prospects, however, worsened. The crop was 
pegged at 41.6 million boxes, down 9% from last month. If correct, it would be 
38% smaller than the 1988-1989 crop.

Securities Issues Up, Underwriting Fees Down: In 1989, corporations issued a 
record $307.7 billion in domestic securities, up 11.9% from the previous year, 
according to a report by New York-based IDD Information Services. However, due 
to increased competition among investment houses, underwriting fees for the 
year fell 20.9% to $3.07 billion.

RALPHS' BONDS DEPRESSED BY CAMPEAU FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors are still cool to the junk bonds of Ralphs Grocery Co., even as a 
growing chorus of analysts are expressing confidence in the supermarket chain. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns were raised by the Chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing Jan. 15 by two 
of Ralphs' sister companies in the troubled Campeau Corp. organization, 
Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy case and is considered in 
relatively good financial shape, the company's bonds have fallen on worries 
that the chain will be dragged into the Campeau morass. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds, which traded as high as $97 per $100 in face value in mid-January, 
have moved down into the mid-$70s during the past two weeks and posted a 
closing bid of $74.50 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Worried investors have pointed to the possibility that Compton-based Ralphs 
will face big tax bills if the Internal Revenue Service demands payment from 
Campeau for $350 million in deferred taxes. Another concern stems from the 
deferred gains taxes of more than $200 million that could be triggered if 
either of the big investors with claims on Ralphs' assets -- Olympia &amp; York 
Developments or Ohio real estate developer Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. -- take over 
the chain. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and company officials, however, say there is no more than a remote 
chance that Ralphs will be hit by either of those problems. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila O'Connell, an analyst with the Duff &amp; Phelps investment firm in 
Chicago, said the Ralphs bonds have been hurt by the overall weakness in the 
junk bond market, too. She predicted that Ralphs bond prices would stay 
depressed until the junk bond market improves or the company can provide 
further assurances to investors.

The national best seller is written by the founder of one of South Korea's 
largest conglomerates, an unabashed workaholic who says he shaves and eats 
breakfast in his car to save time. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Woo-choong heads Daewoo Group, maker of products ranging from Leading Edge 
computers to Pontiac LeMans exports to the U.S. market. Kim says he wrote the 
book to tell young people how to find inspiration and direction in life. Or as 
the suggested title for the English version suggests, "Work!!!" 
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, one of the fastest-growing Asian countries, the drive to 
succeed and make money is a passion. Kim's position as head of a conglomerate 
with 1988 sales of $17.2 billion hasn't hurt his credibility as an author. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing comes free in this life and nothing is accidental," writes Kim, 
53-year-old father of four. "The more you dig, the deeper the hole. And the 
deeper the hole, the more water from the well. That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
More than 900,000 copies of "It's a Big World and There's Lots to be Done" have 
been published since it came out last August. In January the book was in its 
89th printing. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's largest bookstore named it one of the five best sellers of the 
decade. Daewoo says it has even sold the rights to a professor in China for a 
Chinese version. 
</P>
<P>
Although the book has been translated into English, Daewoo is looking for a 
U.S. publisher, and negotiations are under way for publication in other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The 211-page paperback sells for $4.50 and features 39 essays with pithy 
fatherly advice on school, working women, choice of jobs, relationships and 
making money. 
</P>
<P>
His commentary is full of personal anecdotes ranging from his school life ("not 
exemplary") to religion ("better than not having one") to observations on why 
nations in southern Europe waste so much time napping. 
</P>
<P>
Kim says he doesn't exercise, takes no vacations, sleeps five hours a night and 
spends the rest of the time working and making business deals. He wrote the 
book nights while waiting out a shipyard strike last spring. 
</P>
<P>
"My generation didn't eat well and couldn't dress well, but look at the Korea 
that we've built," he says, advising young people not to become smug by the 
country's new consumerism and leisure time. 
</P>
<P>
"Days are too short for me," he writes. "I wish they were 30 or 40 hours long. 
I sometimes shave and wash with a towel in the car on the way to work. I even 
occasionally have breakfast in the car." 
</P>
<P>
He holds staff meetings before or after the regular workday and prides himself 
that at Daewoo, which means "Big House" in Korean, a 9-to-5 workday can mean 5 
a.m. until 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Wasting time is worse than wasting money, for you can always make more money," 
says Kim. "When it comes to making money, I'm an expert." 
</P>
<P>
As founder and chairman of Daewoo, Kim oversees 70 overseas offices and 93,000 
employees involved in trade, construction, shipbuilding, the manufacture of 
cars, industrial robots, telecommunications, consumer electronic products, 
textiles and home appliances. 
</P>
<P>
The book skips over the ways that Daewoo rose from a small textile exporter to 
the world's 46th-largest industrial company in 22 years, omitting mention of 
its ties to past authoritarian governments, low wages, easy bank credit and 
protectionist barriers that allowed Daewoo and other conglomerates to grow. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a frantic trend nowadays to think only in terms of immediate profits," 
Kim writes. "People are looking for comfort and satisfaction rather than having 
a fighting spirit to overcome difficulties and succeed in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
He advises Korean women to stamp out sex discrimination by considering a job 
professionally, not "a bus stop on the way to marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to find places that people have never been to and you have to do 
things that people haven't done before," he advises both sexes. "Of course, 
there's danger in pioneering. Pioneers take paths that haven't been paved." 
</P>
<P>
"There is too much egocentrism," he says. "If everyone's an egoist, then 
there's always going to be trouble." 
</P>
<P>
He recommends forming close lifetime friendships, a code followed closely among 
Korean businessmen who often judge each other by the schools they've attended. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kim exalts nonstop work, he encourages day-dreams. "Dreams are like 
the rudder of a ship setting sail. The rudder may be small and unseen, but it 
controls the ship's course."

AMERICAN AIRLINES SHOWING LESS INTEREST IN CALIFORNIA MARKET; 
</P>
<P>

SAY THE MOVE HELPS SUPPORT HIGHER FARES IN THE STATE.

<P>
American Airlines, the nation's biggest airline, is an also-ran in California. 
</P>
<P>
It moved into the state in a big way when it bought AirCal three years ago, but 
now, it appears, American has lost some interest in California -- the nation's 
biggest travel market. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* It leased four former AirCal Boeing 737s to Braniff Inc., taking the aircraft 
out of the California market. 
</P>
<P>
* It dropped all intrastate flights from Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
* It reduced by half the number of its daily flights to the Los Angeles basin 
from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
These actions were part of American's plan to cut its capacity in the busy 
California corridor by a whopping 40% during the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to an executive at a competing airline, these cutbacks have 
helped support higher air fares that have recently come under fire in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"When you reduce the number of seats, you can increase the fare," said Richard 
Sweet, a marketing executive with Southwest Airlines in Los Angeles. Normally, 
that would chase passengers away, he said, "but American has very, very loyal 
frequent fliers, so the strategy works for them." 
</P>
<P>
According to industry information obtained by The Times, American isn't the 
only airline cutting back in California. USAir -- the state's largest carrier 
since its 1987 purchase of Pacific Southwest Airlines -- has trimmed its 
capacity in California by 25% during the past 18 months. USAir said there 
wasn't enough demand to support so many flights on some of its north-south 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
But American's cutbacks are clearly the most drastic, and they come at a time 
when other airlines, such as United Airlines and Southwest, are putting more 
planes into California. Many in the industry expect that American, as a result 
of its cutbacks, will soon drop to No. 3 in the state, behind USAir and United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
American acknowledges that -- as its actions suggest -- California is not a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things we need to do everywhere, and there simply aren't enough 
airplanes to do it," American spokesman Alton W. Becker Jr. said. "We had to 
make judgments about which markets were most important to us. We could not 
sustain the level of service in California and do other things in our system." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said American doesn't plan to restore any California flights. "We're 
satisfied with our service levels in California." 
</P>
<P>
American's cutbacks are starting to attract attention from state legislators, 
who complain that Californians are not getting good air service. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Roberti, a Democratic state senator from Los Angeles, has proposed 
legislation that would set up a state office "to protect consumers from these 
kinds of actions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti's legislation, approved by the Senate about two weeks ago, would create 
an Office of Airline Consumer Protection to monitor complaints about airlines. 
Though the office would not have the power to regulate airlines, Roberti 
contends that informed consumers can force change on an airline, even if 
government can't. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators are particularly concerned about air fares, which have climbed 
dramatically in the last decade or so. The state Public Utilities Commission 
found that fares between the Los Angeles basin and the San Francisco Bay Area 
rose 40% in that time, while average air fares elsewhere in the nation 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC said it did not have enough information to determine why fares rose so 
sharply here between 1978 and 1988, and no one has linked the 10-year climb in 
fares to American's actions. 
</P>
<P>
However, American's reductions raise questions about its decision to pay $225 
million for AirCal, which was a major carrier between the Los Angeles basin and 
the Bay Area. The corridor linking the five Los Angeles basin airports with the 
three in the Bay Area accounts for 80% of air travel within the state. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, AirCal alone had 252 daily flights within the state. Today, after 
taking an ax to AirCal's schedule, American has only 92 flights in the 
California corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, industry analysts and others familiar with American say the AirCal 
acquisition benefited American because it gave the Dallas-based airline 
hard-to-get gates at Orange County's John Wayne Airport and greater exposure in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always maintained that it was a good deal for AirCal and for American," 
said David A. Banmiller, a former president of AirCal who joined American after 
the merger as a vice president involved with its international operations. Now 
an airline consultant in Orange County, Banmiller said the AirCal deal gave 
American "greater consumer exposure in the Western marketplace, . . . a chance 
to put more product on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that American is reducing its presence in California doesn't mean that 
the AirCal purchase was a bad deal, Banmiller said. "Airline schedules are 
continually adjusted to fit changing situations." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, American has focused its attention primarily in the East. It 
has pulled aircraft out of California to develop a hub in Miami. American 
targeted Miami to take advantage of difficulties at rival Eastern Airlines, 
which was weakened last year by a machinists union strike and bankruptcy court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
This year, American plans to pour resources into Dallas-Ft. Worth, its 
headquarters. The airline recently announced a $276-million expansion there 
that would add 100 daily flights and 55 airport gates, although it faces 
opposition in Dallas from some who think that the move will increase airport 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
On the West Coast, American has concentrated on creating a route network within 
California to feed its hub in San Jose, where, according to a recent state PUC 
study, it controls 50% of the traffic. For example, flights headed to the Bay 
Area from Burbank and Long Beach go only to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose serves as the West Coast link in American's route system, connecting 
with other major points, such as Dallas and Chicago. "Our strategy is to focus 
on hubs, and links to the hubs," said Becker, the American spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of this strategy is American's plan to begin service to Honolulu from 
San Jose next month, or its longer range goal of providing service between San 
Jose and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"American is an east-west airline," said Paul Turk, an analyst with Avmark, a 
Washington aviation consulting firm. "They look to California to feed their 
other routes."

LITTLE GUY PLAYED BIG ROLE

Faster than you can clip a bond coupon, the terror over rising interest rates 
has suddenly subsided. You can thank a lot of small investors -- and hope 
they're right in their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's $30-billion Treasury financing went far more smoothly than Wall 
Street expected, mainly because individual investors were elated at the idea of 
getting 8.4% to 8.6% yields on Uncle Sam's 3-year, 10-year and 30-year notes 
and bonds. And there's a lesson in that for the future. 
</P>
<P>
How hungry were investors? Bond trader Charles Ovis at Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards in Los Angeles says he saw "very good demand from mom-and-pop 
accounts" for the 3-year and 10-year securities. At A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, a 
St. Louis-based brokerage that is a big name throughout the nation's heartland, 
bond trader James Hodapp says he saw "much more demand by individuals than at 
any time since last spring." 
</P>
<P>
Although many analysts had worried that the government would have to pay 
sharply higher rates to sell its notes and bonds, the run-up in rates that had 
taken place in January turned out to be enough. And the euphoria carried into 
Friday, when buyers continued to pour into the Treasury market, fueling a 
tremendous rally. While the government sold its 30-year bonds at an average 
yield of 8.50% on Thursday, by Friday the demand for the bonds was so strong 
that the yield had tumbled to 8.33%. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, analysts had been overly preoccupied with whether Japanese buyers 
would bid for the securities. The experts overlooked the American investor's 
point of view: Rates on short-term investments, such as money market funds, are 
no longer very attractive; high-yield junk bonds have become Untouchables, and 
the stock market looks too risky. That leaves few options for your money. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the average money market mutual fund yield was 8.33%. The yield 
on 30-year T-bonds was 8.05%. So who needed long-term bonds then? Now, the 
average yield is just 7.66%. So 8.50% on a long-term bond is a big incentive to 
invest. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term interest rates in the United States jumped in January largely because 
rates in West Germany and Japan had jumped. Many analysts worry that German and 
Japanese rates will head even higher soon, given the booming economies of those 
nations. The fear is that long-term rates here will follow. But the Treasury 
auction suggests that any rise in rates would quickly bring out a herd of bond 
buyers and that rates here wouldn't stay up for long. If so, that would be good 
news for the housing market, the stock market and the economy in general. Stay 
tuned.

Sutro's Challenge to Brokers: The misfortunes of the nation's major New 
York-based brokerages create great opportunities for regional firms in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere in the 1990s, says Lloyd Greif, vice chairman of Sutro 
&amp; Co. In fact, Greif told a conference of regional brokerage executives in 
San Francisco last week that the decade is theirs to grab. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s clearly belonged to the national securities firms because they were 
the ones that put together the mega-mergers, the billion-dollar-plus hostile 
takeovers," said Greif, who runs Sutro's corporate finance arm from Los 
Angeles. "These major transactions will be fewer and farther between in the 
1990s. . . . But the middle-market deals, those of $250 million and less, are 
continuing to get done," Greif said, because they don't require the junk bond 
financing that big deals required. While most mega-deals were engineered in New 
York, middle-market deals tend to originate outside New York, on regional 
brokerages' turf, Greif said. And Los Angeles, he said, "is the middle-market 
capital of the U.S., if not the world." 
</P>
<P>
Greif isn't talking about hostile takeovers when he uses the word "deal." Most 
middle-market corporate deals are cases of smaller firms making friendly 
purchases of others; family-owned firms that have opted to sell, or 
entrepreneurs looking for financing. Despite the generally sorry state of the 
brokerage business, Sutro's backlog of work in those deal areas is bigger than 
at any time in the '80s, Greif said. "We're hiring," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To keep clients happy in the 1990s -- and to lure new clients -- Greif said 
regional brokerages have to think bigger. In particular, he said, regional 
firms have to think internationally, because that's the way smart corporate 
clients and individual investors will be thinking. And he also warned that 
"California (brokerages) can't focus just on the Pacific Rim, and East Coast 
firms can't concentrate only on Europe. Firms must look at the market on a 
global basis." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: For small-stock fans, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers offers 
a directory of 4,300 over-the-counter firms. It includes address, phone number, 
stock symbol and an investor contact for each firm. Price: $10. Send check or 
money order payable to NASD, plus a shipping label, to: NASD Inc., Book Order 
Dept., P.O. Box 9403, Gaithersburg, Md. 20898-9403 . . . In an uncertain stock 
market, Smith Barney, Harris Upham tells clients to refocus on the basics. 
"Look for companies and industries that are likely to have pricing power in the 
1990s." That means industries where capacity is tight, even in this slow 
economy. "Natural gas producers are an example," the brokerage says.

LORENZO'S LINE JUST WON'T FLY IN FINANCIAL MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The empire of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air Corp., is in serious, 
serious trouble. And it couldn't happen to a nicer guy. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo's problems don't involve airline unions or the managers of conventional 
airlines, who loathe and fear Lorenzo and for years have wished that he would 
shrivel up and blow away. The problems don't even directly involve the 
humongous 1989 loss of $886 million that Texas Air, which owns Eastern Air 
Lines and Continental Airlines, reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Lorenzo's problem is the evaporation of the financial markets' enormous 
enthusiasm for airline assets. The enthusiasm -- which peaked in late summer, 
with Texas Air stock in the $20 range -- burst like a bubble in October when 
the $300-a-share United Airlines buyout cratered. Suddenly, everyone remembered 
that airlines are cyclical businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But most of Lorenzo's problem is self-made. Lorenzo, whose debt-laden 
Continental Airlines couldn't make money on its operations last year, a boom 
time in the airline business, has had his credibility shattered by recent 
developments at Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the creditors of Eastern, which has been operating under 
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since March 9, 1989, loved Lorenzo and 
believed his every word. Especially the magic words: 'I'll pay 100% of your 
claim." Lorenzo had paid everyone 100% after he put Continental into bankruptcy 
in the early 1980s, so he could do it again. 
</P>
<P>
But the affair between Lorenzo and Eastern's creditors came to a shocking end 
-- shocking for the creditors, that is -- in late January, when Lorenzo 
unveiled Eastern's plan to emerge from Chapter 11. Oops! Even though some of 
Eastern's creditors were to get 100% of face value, lots of people were being 
offered securities and cash ranging from maybe 45 cents of face value (for 
unsecured creditors) to less than 5 cents (for some preferred stockholders). 
</P>
<P>
The jilted creditors feel betrayed, to put it mildly. As William Congreve would 
have said if he wrote about bankruptcy rather than more earthy passions, "Hell 
hath no fury like a creditor scorned." 
</P>
<P>
To sweeten his plan, Lorenzo offered the unsecured creditors 40% of the stock 
of the new, post-bankruptcy Eastern. Given that Lorenzo, renowned for tough 
bargaining, is making an initial offer of 40%, it seems reasonable to assume 
that when and if the New Eastern emerges from Chapter 11, Lorenzo's Texas Air 
will own much less than the 60% that it proposes to keep. It may end up with 
very little of Eastern -- or none at all. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's another problem, involving Eastern's dealings with other Texas Air 
companies. Up to now, no one in the bankruptcy proceedings except Eastern's 
labor unions seemed to care very much about these deals in which Eastern always 
seemed to get the short end. And the unions, as the Miami Review showed in two 
excellent articles in December, haven't been a factor in the bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new circumstances, Eastern's creditors now care about these deals. A 
lot. A report by a court-appointed examiner is due one of these days, and it 
should make interesting reading. Lorenzo, who always defended the deals, told 
airline securities analysts in a Jan. 30 meeting that he has made a settlement 
offer for those transactions. How much, he didn't say. 
</P>
<P>
But isn't Lorenzo well rid of Eastern, which wasn't worth anything anyway? No, 
because Texas Air can't just walk away from Eastern. It has guaranteed payment 
of interest and principal on $240 million of Eastern preferred stock that it 
gave to Eastern's stockholders in 1986 when it bought the company. The 
dividends run about $6.7 million every three months, and Texas Air has made the 
last three quarterly payments. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the real doozy: Eastern's unfunded pension liability, an 
obligation for which not only Eastern but also Texas Air and all its companies 
are "jointly and severally liable." That's lawyer talk for "on the hook." Last 
month, Lorenzo talked about a $450-million pension shortfall at Eastern. The 
U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which crunches the numbers using different 
assumptions, puts the shortfall at $1.1 billion and has gotten involved in the 
bankruptcy proceedings to protect its interests. 
</P>
<P>
How deep is the pension hole, and how much will Texas Air have to put in toward 
filling it? Who knows? But it's obviously a lot. 
</P>
<P>
Given the confusing way in which Lorenzo's empire reports financial results -- 
for example, the reported cash positions of Texas Air, Eastern and Continental 
as of Sept. 30 seemed to add up to $100 million more than the cash actually on 
hand -- it's hard to tell the true circumstances of Continental or Texas Air. 
But they can't be very good. 
</P>
<P>
The bond market is treating Texas Air as if it's going to default on its debts. 
The last time I looked, the Texas Air bonds maturing this October were yielding 
about 25% a year. Bonds due in 1992 had annual yields in the 35% to 40% range. 
If the bond market's pricing is even close to right, Texas Air stock, recently 
at about $6, is overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo has escaped disaster before. But this time, with the financial markets 
against him, fuel prices rising and his credibility in tatters, he may be on 
his final flight. 
</P>
<P>
When Lorenzo took over Eastern in 1986, he was hailed as a genius, and Texas 
Air stock rose to the $50 range. What an irony it will be if Eastern turns out 
to be what sinks him.

CHILDREN WITH VIOLENCE IN THEIR PASTS LEARN TO COPE WITH DEATH

Mark slouches in a grown-ups' chair, his feet dangling, his 6-year-old face 
solemn. He has just finished a doughnut and is telling the others in the room 
how his Dad was killed -- "He got hit on a motorcycle, without a helmet." Mark 
sucks his thumb for a moment, then, expressionless, adds, "It was sad." 
</P>
<P>
He is the youngest member of a peer bereavement group at Hathaway Children's 
Services in Pacoima, a private nonprofit agency serving severely emotionally 
disturbed children ages 5-18. 
</P>
<P>
Once a week, for an hour, eight of these youngsters, most of whom call Hathaway 
home for now, sit around a small room with counselors and talk about the deaths 
of people they loved. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they are dealing with violent deaths. Shooting deaths. 
Deaths from drug overdoses. Suicides. 
</P>
<P>
Death is not the only trauma in the young lives of these youngsters, whom 
social workers call "multiproblem" children. Their home lives have been filled 
with physical and sexual abuse, multiple foster homes, failed adoptions, 
instability. 
</P>
<P>
The bereavement group is one way one agency is trying to meet the needs of a 
society in which adolescents and preadolescents now deal with such realities as 
drug-dependent parents and gang murders of peers. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Eric says: "I'm here, because, when I was 14 months old, my 
mother committed suicide with a sleeping agent." He describes an abusive early 
childhood in the care of his father, until, at age 4, he went to live with his 
grandmother. Since then, Eric adds, his voice without emotion, he has been in 
and out of placements. 
</P>
<P>
When he was eight, he says, "I started to freak out." A Hathaway resident for 2 
1/2 years, he is trying to deal with "rejection and all that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
It was Eric who suggested the need for this group, started 16 months ago by 
therapist Pamela Davis, of the Hathaway staff, and Stephen Lott, a psychology 
intern. Davis, as a former medical social worker, was experienced in dealing 
with death and grief. 
</P>
<P>
In the bereavement group, Davis says, the youngsters (all of whose names have 
been changed in this story to protect their privacy) find "a place where they 
have friends they can talk to about losing a person they've been real close to. 
They know how to offer each other support." 
</P>
<P>
Six-year-old Mark, who lives at Hathaway, joined in October, a month after his 
father was killed. Usually, he stays for only 30 minutes each time, which 
counselors feel is all he can handle. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent session, with prompting from group leaders, he talked about death 
and cemeteries. Then he wiggled out of his chair, and, on all fours, began 
chasing a moth. Later, he climbed onto a sofa next to Eric and silently linked 
one arm through the older boy's. 
</P>
<P>
Laura, a worldly wise 13-year-old who was concentrating on applying her lip 
gloss, thinks Mark is doing well. "Sometimes little kids can't handle some of 
the things here," she says, adding, "I just fiddle with my fingers" if things 
get bad. 
</P>
<P>
But, prompted, she talks openly about her loss -- the death from cancer of the 
beloved aunt with whom she lived. 
</P>
<P>
She talks, too, about an abusive mother who treated her like "a big maid around 
the house. If I'd quit, she'd spank me with a big 4-by-4 board. My life was 
really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Laura lived at Hathaway, off and on, for seven years, from the time she was age 
7; now she lives in the Valley with her father but attends school at Hathaway. 
</P>
<P>
Does she see her mother? 
</P>
<P>
Laura smiles, and says, "If I did, I'd run." 
</P>
<P>
She is in transition. She has taken the first step in breaking away from 
Hathaway but is not ready for total integration into the mainstream, for public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle, 12, another member of the group, is wearing a "Don't worry. Be Happy" 
T-shirt. And she is explaining that her mother died in August -- "She got hit 
by a car" while walking down the street. (The driver was on drugs). 
</P>
<P>
What she does not say is that she had been removed from her mother's home, an 
abusive situation, at age 4 months, that her father is also dead. Michelle has 
lived at Hathaway for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an interview, Davis explains that with these children "there is still 
a fantasy that I'll get back together with my mother and things eventually will 
end up OK." 
</P>
<P>
Such fantasies are part of the glue that bonds them to one another. 
</P>
<P>
Mark, for example, talks about having seen his father killed. But, Davis says, 
"He did not see it. He'll describe it to you as though he had seen it. Maybe he 
feels he would be a little closer to him if he had seen it." 
</P>
<P>
As they share, the youngsters start to see reality. Linda Librizzi, assistant 
director of clinical services who is sitting in on this session with two 
interns while Davis is on maternity leave, describes that truth -- that "life 
was hell" for all of them even before this awful thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the group plays games like "three wishes." This day, Laura's wishes 
are "that my aunt took care of herself and went to the doctor, that my real 
grandmother is not dead any more . . . and that I'd get rich." 
</P>
<P>
Eric's first wish is that "wherever my mom is, for her to take care of her 
problems and not be a fool." His second is "to have a better family," instead 
of the one he has, all of whom, he says, have "long hair and beards and stuff. 
My grandma has a beard." 
</P>
<P>
The group titters at this revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Eric says, she does have a lot of chin hairs. 
</P>
<P>
His third wish: "To make it through college." 
</P>
<P>
He talks about being an orthopedic surgeon, then adds, "but I've thought of 
being a mortician." There is a strange silence. Eric smiles and says, "That was 
just a cruel joke." 
</P>
<P>
All he wants, Mark says, is "for my father to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
But he's dead and, Mark adds, "It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew, 14, who has been silent, wishes only "to go home." Later, a counselor 
says that "like many others here, there have been suicides in his family, a 
long history of more than one." 
</P>
<P>
As therapy, members of the group have written poems, which have been 
mimeographed and stapled into a little booklet called, "I Love You, Thank you, 
Good-Bye." 
</P>
<P>
These are not love poems in any traditional sense. 
</P>
<P>
One child wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 You killed my sister, 
</P>
<P>
 And screwed up my life 
</P>
<P>
 And hurt my family. ... 
</P>
<P>
 Mark wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 You did a stupid thing. You shouldn't 
</P>
<P>
 Have gone so fast on that motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 You knew it was dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 You should have worn a helmet or something 
</P>
<P>
 To protect your head. ... 
</P>
<P>
 His poem concludes: 
</P>
<P>
 You really hurt me and a lot 
</P>
<P>
 Of other people. 
</P>
<P>
 One contribution is a "Dear Mom" letter to a dead mother from a runaway 
daughter. It asks, "So how do you like life up there, or down there? . . . I 
know I've hurt you and you hurt me, but when we meet again I hope our lives 
will be 100% better. . . . I am sad 'cause I never got to say I love you. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
Early on, each youngster was asked to draw a picture of the person who had 
died, as a way of introducing that person. 
</P>
<P>
Davis remembers a picture drawn by one 12-year-old: "There were more drugs in 
that picture, things I'd never heard of. He was able to really share a lot of 
anger about his mother using drugs," his fury at the boyfriend who got her 
hooked. The mother had died of an apparent overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to depict what happens to a person after they die, one child painted his 
paper totally black, with "blood" dripping down; another, a youngster who 
tended to deny feelings, drew a big sun with flowers, all bright and yellow and 
pretty. 
</P>
<P>
On average, a child stays 11 months in the group. Some can't handle it and drop 
out. Others cling to it. Everyone also receives one-on-one psychotherapy twice 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Brooks, a Hathaway staff psychologist, speaks of the "tremendous value" 
of this group of peers in dealing with loss: "The worst thing in the world one 
can do . . . is keep it to themselves. It just festers." Alone, he says, 
youngsters can become detached from reality, which creates fertile ground for 
"the seeds for feelings of hatred and cruelty." 
</P>
<P>
"Violence tends to replicate itself," Brooks says. "When kids have been exposed 
to violence, you see it in the violence they enact." He adds, "Anyone who has 
experienced a murder, that in itself decreases the preciousness of life and 
increases the possibility that the person himself could be capable of 
murdering." 
</P>
<P>
And, Brooks says, a child exposed to life-threatening circumstances and the 
attendant chronic fear may, as an adult, "turn the tables. They put other 
people in the circumstances they were in. It devalues life." 
</P>
<P>
Some in the group have had scrapes with the law -- perhaps arrests for theft or 
drugs. And, Davis says, "there have been times when kids have been suicidal," 
overwhelmed by guilt feelings about a parent's death or wanting to join that 
person in death. 
</P>
<P>
No one is forced to attend, but they are strongly encouraged. Of course, Davis 
says, a child may sabotage the effort by refusing to be an active participant. 
But even then, she says, it is helpful for that kid to see that others are "not 
embarrassed to share how sad they feel, that it's OK to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
At home, she says, "it's not really OK for them to talk with their mother about 
the father that has died." It is difficult to express anger at a dead parent 
with whom one had had a troubled relationship. But these children are angry. 
Angry that a mother or father was not there for a birthday, for Christmas. A 
girl who lost her mother on her birthday wondered whether it was OK for her to 
celebrate birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
Like Eric, an engaging youngster with a curly ponytail and an earring in his 
left ear, many have gone from abusive homes into foster homes or group homes, 
where they would act out, and finally to Hathaway. There, Brooks says, they 
find "a safe place that isn't going to hurt them back." 
</P>
<P>
Hathaway was founded as "Kiddie Koop," an orphanage, in 1919. Today it's 
situated on an idyllic 300 acres in Angeles National Forest -- once Cecil B. 
DeMille's ranch and a gift from the DeMille family. It houses 126 children, who 
may attend an on-site accredited school through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
Eric has, through therapy, come to realize that it was not his fault that his 
mother killed herself, that it was "her problems." At 15, he has known tragedy 
enough for a lifetime: His aunt was shot and killed the year before his 
mother's suicide. His mother was pregnant when she killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
He describes his father, a Vietnam veteran almost legally deaf from mortar 
shelling, as "wild and he smokes marijuana. I try to keep my home visits to a 
minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, he says, his Dad grows morose and "he cries and talks to me about 
Mom, about Vietnam. He showed me a bracelet that belonged to my mom." 
</P>
<P>
At a recent group session, Laura listened to this and suggested, "If I were 
your father, I'd bury the jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
Last Veterans' Day, Eric, with his Dad, visited his mother's grave at Forest 
Lawn. The traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the black granite 
wall, was also there that day. 
</P>
<P>
"That," Eric says, "was heavy duty." 
</P>
<P>
He wants to be a surgeon. Michelle wants to be a teacher. Laura wants to be a 
lawyer, working with troubled kids. 
</P>
<P>
But, in reality, what are their chances? Some Hathaway youngsters will make it, 
Librizzi says -- "There are some resources out there for kids who have been 
part of the system," money for education. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hathaway statistics, 68% of the youngsters -- who are referred by 
agencies including the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services and 
the Probation Department -- will improve enough to return to their own home, a 
foster or adoptive home, a group home or a less intensive institution. The 
average residential stay at Hathaway is 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
The bereavement group is special, Librizzi says, in that "death is what binds 
them together." 
</P>
<P>
In group, Librizzi asks Mark, the youngest member, "If there's a little boy or 
girl who lives at home and their Mom or Dad dies, what do you think they should 
do?" 
</P>
<P>
Mark removes his thumb from his mouth and says he thinks they should talk to 
other family members. His 4-year-old brother, he adds, "asks me a lot of 
questions."

BIG BROTHERS PUT 45 ON THE BLOCK TO THE TUNE OF $67,000

Fun. Excitement. Romance. Dudes. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the draws at the fourth annual Bachelor Auction held by Big Brothers 
of Greater Los Angeles on Thursday night at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
There were 600 women to place their bids on 45 bachelors, including KNBC 
newsmen John Beard and Bret Lewis, singer Ray Parker Jr. and Rams linebacker 
Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the women, like Sherryl Pinsher, were there with credit cards in hand. 
"I've got a nice limit on my Visa," she said, surveying the tuxedoed bachelors 
at a reception before the auction. 
</P>
<P>
The dates for sale ranged from dinners for two at local restaurants to ski 
weekends in Lake Tahoe and Mammoth -- but one of the most popular packages was 
a ticket to "Phantom of the Opera" and an after-show date with star Michael 
Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
"Make sure you have fun and make sure you get your money's worth," said Beard 
before turning the evening over to emcee Ted Ziegenbusch, honoree Cathy Crosby 
and auctioneer Chris Sheik. And, for the next few hours, 45 bachelors walked a 
runway as the women whooped, screamed and waved their bidding paddles. "It's 
like a classy Chippendales," noted one volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crawford, auctioned in absentia, went for $4,000. But it was television 
actor Gil Gerard who carried the highest price tag, for a simple date package 
watching the sunset from a restaurant in Malibu. The winning bid was $5,100. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the evening, Big Brothers had charted its most successful auction 
ever, and was ringing up women's credit cards to the tune of $67,000. 
</P>
<P>
Who says it's hard to get a date in L.A.?

BACHELORS GO HOLLYWOOD IN ANNUAL BASH

<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time -- in 1905, to be exact -- a group of single gentlemen formed 
The Bachelors to host an annual gala to repay social obligations. Tradition 
continued Friday in what must be the ultimate fancy dress ball in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Sean Conway McCarthy (escorting Mary Louise Frawley) went Hollywood 
with film reels on tables, Cocoanut Grove-like Mylar palms shining in the 
Beverly Hilton ballroom, blowups of Lana Turner and Jean Harlow. Lester 
Lannin's Orchestra rocked until 4 a.m. for nearly 850, with a multicourse 
dinner and onion soup at 2 a.m. interspersed. 
</P>
<P>
President Walter Wilson, secretary Hugh Bateman and treasurer William Bessolo 
received with patronesses Mrs. Felix (Barbara) McGinnis, Mrs. William French 
(Jean) Smith and Mrs. Donald (Anne) Moulton. Among prominent Bachelors: Scott 
Brittingham, William Ahmanson, Scott Adair, Hugh Evans III, Peter Adams, Palmer 
Casey, Chauncey Medberry, Whitley Collins, Robert Fuelling, B.D. and Briant 
Howes, Richard Mogan, John Welborne, Grafton Tanquary and William Williams.

'KILL ME AGAIN' DISCOVERS IT'S BETTER THE SECOND TIME AROUND; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE PERSEVERANCE OF FILM MAKERS, AND A LITTLE HELP FROM CRITICS, HAS 
BREATHED NEW LIFE INTO THE LOW-BUDGET THRILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a disastrous regional opening last fall, "Kill Me Again" was thought to 
be dead and nearly buried -- and destined for a video afterlife. It's only 
because of the perseverance of its film makers -- and an assist from the 
critics -- that "Kill Me Again" is playing again. 
</P>
<P>
The resurrection of the modest, film noir-ish thriller is under way at the Mann 
Westwood Theater, where the first two weeks' ticket sales topped $28,000. 
That's brisk enough business to warrant additional theaters, says Barry 
Glasser, senior vice president of publicity for the distributing MGM/UA. And 
so, on Friday, "Kill Me Again" will make its way into "a yet undetermined 
number" of additional Los Angeles-area theaters. "We're moving carefully. We 
have to," says Glasser, stressing, "This isn't a mainstream movie we're talking 
about. It doesn't have superstars or a science-fiction gimmick." 
</P>
<P>
What "Kill Me Again" has are blatantly familiar noir elements -- including the 
down-on-his-luck private eye (played by Val Kilmer) and the femme fatale 
(played by Kilmer's wife, Joanne Whalley-Kilmer); plus, the noir look -- 
complete with the obligatory Venetian blinds. 
</P>
<P>
The first feature for producer David W. Warfield and director John Dahl, 
co-writers of the project, "Kill Me Again" was filmed last spring for about 
$4.5 million. Propaganda Films, known for rock videos and commercials, produced 
in conjunction with Polygram Pictures and MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, "Kill Me Again" was one of a number of small films that the 
once-lofty MGM/UA ultimately chose to release regionally. And so, late last 
October, "Kill Me Again" made its way into 220 theaters. With the exception of 
San Francisco, they were located primarily in the South where the ad campaign 
stressed the picture's action-thriller elements. 
</P>
<P>
"We died immediately," remembers Dahl. "We didn't even last out the week at a 
lot of the theaters." 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if "Kill Me Again" was going to join the myriad of titles that 
have had to find their audience via video. Then -- appropriately -- came a plot 
twist (plot twists, after all, are a film noir convention). Reviews began 
trickling in -- some from cities where the movie had been pulled before the 
reviews even ran. To the surprise of Warfield and Dahl, most critics -- 
including those from the trade papers, Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter 
-- had given their picture a thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with reviews from places like New Orleans, Oklahoma City and Little Rock 
as well as San Francisco, Warfield and Dahl went to MGM/UA to ask for a second 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Michael Madsen, who co-stars as Whalley-Kilmer's psycho ex-con boyfriend, 
also got into the act -- putting in telephone calls to studio executives, 
including head of distribution Jack Foley. 
</P>
<P>
The first week's ticket sales in Westwood were an impressive $18,000. Week two 
brought in a respectable $10,000. Reviews have been equally respectable. 
KABC-TV's Gary Franklin gave the film an "8" (of a possible "10"). KNBC-TV's 
David Sheehan called it "a fairly classy little thriller." The Times' Michael 
Wilmington found it "easy to praise, because it's small, cool and 
craftsman-like." 
</P>
<P>
The real test, however, continues to be at the box office where the competition 
is suddenly heating up, following a sleepy start to the film year. Ironically, 
MGM/UA -- which hasn't released a major movie for months -- is providing some 
of the competition, with its release of the just-out "Stanley &amp; Iris," 
starring Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro.

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ARENA UNNEEDED IN O.C., 57% SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About 57% of Orange County residents say they do not believe that a new sports 
arena is needed in the county, despite plans to build state-of-the art indoor 
facilities in Santa Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, according to The Times Poll, there appears to be plenty of fans 
willing to attend National Basketball Assn. or National Hockey League games if 
either arena is built. And those with a preference for a city overwhelmingly 
prefer Anaheim to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a tradition of fiscal conservatism, nearly two-thirds of Orange County 
residents either favor using public funds for a new sports arena or would 
approve of taxpayer support, depending "on the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Even though most people don't think a new arena is needed, chief negotiators 
for the competing projects said the poll results show broad-based patronage for 
the arenas they hope to build. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's tremendous support for what we've been saying, particularly when 
that's reflected in numbers of people" rather than in percentages, said Neal 
Papiano, attorney for Ogden Corp., which hopes to build a $95-million arena in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Also upbeat was Tony Guanci, of King Guanci Development Inc. of Newport Beach, 
which is working with Spectacor Management Services and MCA Entertainment to 
bring a $75-million arena to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, I think it's a good indication that the NBA and the NHL . . . 
would be supported in Orange County," Guanci said. "That's why we believe 
strongly that there are teams that would like to relocate in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, has a margin of error of plus or minus four 
points on results from Orange County, and three points for results tabulated 
from Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana and Anaheim each hopes to lure NBA or NHL franchises to play in their 
as-yet unbuilt indoor arenas. If an arena is built, 43% of those questioned 
said they would attend NBA games and 39% said they would attend NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
In a county of 1.7 million adult residents, this means that there may be 
663,000 to 731,000 adults willing to buy tickets, seemingly more than enough to 
regularly fill the 20,000-seat arenas proposed in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that there is that much interest is very exciting," Papiano said. 
"Keep in mind, you are only talking about 20,000 seats." 
</P>
<P>
Among those polled by The Times was Terry Miller of Fullerton, who said she 
probably would not attend basketball or hockey games in an Orange County arena 
because she is "not a sports-minded person." 
</P>
<P>
However, "my husband follows basketball, and I think he probably would," Miller 
said. "The only reason he doesn't attend them (basketball games) right now is 
he doesn't like driving that far" to Los Angeles and Inglewood, where the 
area's only two NBA franchises are located. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll also found that the median ticket price residents are willing to 
pay to attend professional basketball and hockey games is near to the existing 
price of tickets in the NBA and NHL. 
</P>
<P>
The average price that those polled said they would be willing to pay for NBA 
tickets is $19.30 and for NHL tickets $17.60. The average ticket price in the 
NBA of $19.21, and the average in the NHL is $18 to $19. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a significant number of Orange County residents, 18%, said they 
would be willing to pay $21 or more to attend NBA or NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
But there were extremely few residents who said they would be willing to 
purchase season tickets to either NBA or NHL teams playing in an Orange County 
arena. Only 4% of those asked said they would buy NBA season tickets and only 
1% said they would buy NHL season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
With the cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana racing to see which will build an 
arena first, The Times Poll found a preference for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
When asked in which city they would be more likely to attend sporting events, 
22% said Anaheim, while only 7% favored Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
However, 34% said they would attend events in either city. But 35% said it is 
not likely that they would attend events in either city. 
</P>
<P>
"The image that Santa Ana has had in the past is not too favorable," said Santa 
Ana Councilman John Acosta, "but we're coming out of that. You're seeing all 
these major developers coming back to Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Although the arenas in Anaheim and Santa Ana are to be privately built and 
operated, the current proposals also call for some public funding. This concept 
apparently doesn't disturb Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
A 52% majority of those polled said that, depending "on the circumstances," 
they would approve of using public funds to pay for sports arenas. Of the 
balance of those questioned, 32% said public funds should not be spent, while 
12% said the spending of public funds would be all right with them. 
</P>
<P>
Guanci said those conditionally supportive of using public funds would find the 
Santa Ana proposal acceptable. Santa Ana's arena is expected to use property 
taxes generated by the arena improvements, he said, and would not draw from the 
city's general fund or affect services, such as police and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Papiano also was encouraged by response on public funding because the Anaheim 
arena "is not all going to be built with public funds." Anaheim has issued $18 
million in bonds to be repaid by an increase in its motel and hotel bed tax to 
acquire land for the arena.

PERRIER WATER SCARE GOES FLAT IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life proceeded quite nicely in Southern California on Sunday in the wake of the 
recall of Perrier water due to a chemical contamination scare. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it seems that Perrier -- once so popular as a symbol of health in the 
trendy Southland -- has become downright passe in some local watering holes, 
grocery stores and exercise salons. 
</P>
<P>
"We use Calistoga," Rose Cafe manager Cheron Vekavat said above the 
brunch-crowd din in Venice. "It tastes better." 
</P>
<P>
"Perrier today is a shadow of its former self," said Carl Lundgren, general 
manager of Vicente Foods, a Brentwood market popular with the movie crowd. 
Non-carbonated distilled water, like Evian, is what's in these days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many new source waters around," said Robert Schwan, general 
manager of 72 Market St., a restaurant in Venice. "There's no reason to use 
Perrier. It's a little pricey." 
</P>
<P>
Even at two well-known West Side health clubs -- the Sports Connection in West 
Hollywood and actress Jane Fonda's Workout Center in Beverly Hills -- the 
recall was a non-event. Both clubs said they serve Evian. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, the recall had an impact at (ixi:z), a men's clothing store on Rodeo 
Drive that has the nation's only water bar??? No. The bar, opened amid some 
fanfare in late 1986, closed about a year ago, a store spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The recall did send tremors through luxury hotels owned by Severyn Ashkenazy -- 
like L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills and Le Bel Age in West Hollwyood -- because 
each room had two bottles of Perrier in their refrigerators. The bottles, about 
2,400 in all, had to be seized from the rooms, Ashkenazy said. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier's misfortune, though, was a boon for sales of bottled seltzer water. 
"They doubled in one evening," Ashkenazy said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone had heard about the recall Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At the El Gaucho Liquor Market in Santa Ana, night manager Bryan Lee said he 
was totally unaware that there was any problem with Perrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew a thing about it until some news reporter came in here (Sunday 
night)," Lee said. He added that he would talk to the market's owner today to 
see what she wants to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Jackson, assistant manager at the Original Irvine Ranch Market in Costa 
Mesa, said he had heard "not a word" about the recall from anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people care anymore," he said. "No matter what you eat or drink, 
you're going to die anyway." 
</P>
<P>
At the Tustin Yacht Club in Tustin, which specializes in steak and seafood, 
owner Jack Morrell said he hasn't heard much about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting here looking at about five cases of it," he said. "I guess I'll 
sell it if people want it." 
</P>
<P>
And at the fashionable Pirets restaurant at South Coast Plaze, the Perrier 
scare was not a problem at all -- more than a year ago its managers switched to 
its own personal brand of mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
The Perrier scare began late Friday when officials of the French-based firm 
began the recall of as many as 72 million bottles nationwide. Some bottles had 
been found to be contaminated with benzene, a colorless chemical used in the 
manufacture of such products as paint and detergents. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina health officials made the discovery during routine testing, and 
while U.S. health officials played down the immediate danger to consumers, 
Perrier took no chances and ordered the recall. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason at all it should be in our product," a Perrier spokesman 
said. "We don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Though Perrier has many challengers today, it remains the nation's most popular 
carbonated water, with about $160 million in annual sales. Perrier officials 
say they will stop sales for up to three months, which could cost them $40 
million in lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
One of Perrier's competitors LaCroix Sparkling Water in LaCrosse, Wis., said 
Sunday that it planned to increase its output by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a chance . . . to jump in and fill the void," a LaCroix spokesman said.

OIL'S SPREAD FRUSTRATES CLEANUP OF OCEAN SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although only a third of the nearly 400,000 gallons of oil spilled offshore 
Wednesday remained at sea Sunday, the meandering crude was so dispersed that 
cleanup crews held little hope of skimming much more of it from the water. 
</P>
<P>
With a mild cold front expected in Southern California late today or Tuesday, 
cleanup officials said resulting onshore winds could blow the estimated 131,000 
gallons ashore to be collected by more than 400 workers who have been deployed 
between Laguna Beach and Seal Beach with absorbent pompoms and foam pads. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, officials said, waves associated with the weather front could break 
up the oil altogether before the slick reaches land. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I knew where it would go," mused Roy McClymonds, general manager of 
Clean Coastal Waters of Long Beach -- a nonprofit oil industry cooperative 
assisting in the cleanup. "I wouldn't even want to guess." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, thick frothy oil, known as "mousse" to cleanup crews, began 
coming ashore at the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier and along a 3.5-mile 
stretch to the north. The Coast Guard said 200 workers were to be sent to the 
soiled areas by midnight, and additional booms would be placed off the Anaheim 
Bay jetty. 
</P>
<P>
A small flotilla of 14 skimming vessels had been deployed Sunday, and another 
four were to join in the cleanup today. However, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer 
Dennis Hall said the skimmers were greatly handicapped in their oil collection 
efforts because the oil had spread in many areas into a thin sheen, with 
microscopic thickness in places. And the sheen -- already 14 miles long and 
five to six miles wide Sunday afternoon -- was continuing to expand, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheen was so thin that additional boats had to be called in Sunday to 
corral the oil into heavy enough concentrations for the skimmers to function, 
said McClymonds, whose cooperative is operating nine of the skimmers. This was 
done, he said, by dragging long extensions of containment boom behind the 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes longer," McClymonds said of the corralling process. "Obviously, we 
have to go for a while until we get a concentration. The thinner the oil gets, 
the less effective the skimmers are, until you concentrate the oil in a larger 
pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Capt. James Card, who is heading the cleanup, estimated that 
roughly two-thirds of the oil has been accounted for -- about 23% through 
skimming and other recovery methods and 43% through evaporation, leaving 
131,087 gallons at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to favorable winds since the spill, Card and other federal officials 
said the Huntington Beach cleanup has proven more successful than in other 
spills, which have seen an average recovery of only about 10% of the lost oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy with the results so far, but we've still got a ways to go," 
Card said. 
</P>
<P>
A critical spot now remains the mouth of the Santa River -- and the Huntington 
Beach wetlands that sit just a half-mile behind it. The wetlands are a 
vulnerable environment supporting rare animal species. Cleanup crews devoted 
some of their efforts to the wetlands Sunday, working to shore up a temporary 
dam in case of a storm. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the one area we've seen so far that has had a real threat from the oil 
and, of course, that's a very sensitive area," said Lt. Reed Smith of the state 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a man-made sand dam and layers of booms at the mouth of the river, some 
minimal amounts of oil may have seeped through during high tide Sunday and over 
the last few days, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Smith, administrator for the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, 
said: "The probability is that if a storm comes Tuesday or Wednesday, the sand 
(dam) just won't hold. The more saturated it gets, the more erosion there is." 
</P>
<P>
Worried about that prospect, cleanup officials decided to add a layer of 
sandbags to the Santa Ana River dam to try to protect it from a potential 
storm. At the same time, they also planned to open a notch in the dam to allow 
fresh water into the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Should the oil reach the 2.5 acres of marshland behind the mouth of the river 
-- an area that is now undergoing restoration, "it'll set us back years," Smith 
said. The oil, tough if not impossible to clean from marshlands, would coat the 
muddy bottom of the wetlands and threaten small animals at the base of its food 
chain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Containment booms in place at entrances to a number of other environmentally 
sensitive areas, including the Bolsa Chica wetlands, were reinforced Sunday 
after a Coast Guard overflight showed that the oil sheen had extended farther 
northwest, to an area off Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Floodgates connecting the Bolsa Chica wetlands to Anaheim Bay were closed as a 
precaution. The mouth of Anaheim Bay, which is the entrance to the Bolsa Chica 
sanctuary, was protected with a triple boom, a Coast Guard utility boat and a 
skimmer. New booms were placed across the entrance to Alamitos Bay and the San 
Gabriel River estuary late Saturday to protect marinas and wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
While only small amounts of oil washed ashore through most of Sunday, heavier 
deposits appeared after dark, and cleanup crews stationed along the coast 
braced for an onslaught of goop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so bad right now, but we're expecting it to get much worse," said 
cleanup worker Angela Bowen, 18, of Riverside as she took a lunch break from 
her patrol duties near the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
In all, area beaches were patrolled by 415 workers for an assortment of cleanup 
contractors retained by British Petroleum America Inc., which leases the 
stricken tanker American Trader from American Trading Transportation Co. of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
In the company's first hint at what the massive cleanup operation might cost, 
British Petroleum spokesman Charles Webster said the company has already spent 
"millions and millions" of dollars. The bulk of that expense has gone toward 
hiring hundreds of cleanup workers and providing equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum officials said their contractors managed to maintain a full 
deployment Sunday, despite an edict from the federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration on Saturday that some workers would have to be sidelined 
temporarily because they had not undergone the required 24 hours of training in 
oil cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
All the workers remained on the job Sunday as contractors worked out a schedule 
with OSHA for the training to be undertaken early this week, said Tony 
Kozlowski, a British Petroleum spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Although cleanup crews on the beach had little to do except patrol and pick up 
occasional oil-stained garbage, police and lifeguards kept beaches closed 
between Newport Beach and Seal Beach to all but authorized visitors. In 
Huntington Beach, however, that edict did not keep back the curious, who dashed 
from an open bicycle path to the oily shore. 
</P>
<P>
"One person will go, and then you get a whole flood of people," said Rick 
Reisenhofer, a Huntington Beach state lifeguard. "We get a lot of looky-loos, 
and you can't blame them really. A lot of people have been frustrated because 
they don't know what they can do to help."

An 8-year-old girl was hit in the back by an apparently errant bullet about 6 
p.m. Sunday as she rode an open-car train through the Fantasyland section of 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. John Cross said the that shot apparently was fired from 
outside the park, but that there were no reports of shooting in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Nayeli Diane Placentia of Downey was in guarded condition Sunday night in the 
pediatrics intensive care unit at UCI Medical Center in Orange after surgery to 
remove the bullet from her back.

Cross said the girl did not realize she had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
"She complained to her parents that something struck her back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's parents, whose names were not released, took her to Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim, where doctors discovered the bullet wound. Cross said police 
were called at 6:43 p.m. by hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was transferred to UCI Medical Center for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the operation was successful," Cross said. He added that the bullet 
removed by doctors was of small caliber, most likely from a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators were on the scene Sunday night attempting to discover 
where the shot came from. The girl and her family had been sitting together in 
one of the train's open-sided cars with a canvas roof. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think this was intentional at all," Cross said. "It probably was 
someone firing a shot into the air." He added that it almost certainly occurred 
off park property. 
</P>
<P>
A Disneyland night manager said that park representatives had ordered him not 
to say anything about the shooting except that park public information officers 
would answer news media questions today. 
</P>
<P>
Operations at the park, which remained open until midnight Sunday, were not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
Cross said there were no reports that anyone near the girl heard any shots or 
knew what had happened.

DESIGN STANDARDS DECISION DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has postponed for three months a decision on setting new 
design standards for gasoline stations and automobile repair shops. 
</P>
<P>
The council had been scheduled to vote on an ordinance that would affect future 
stations or those planning extensive remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we really want to get right," said City Manager David N. Ream. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, in its current form, would require stations to have such 
features as 15 feet of frontage landscaping, five-foot planters around all 
buildings, parking next to convenience stores, and a wall at least six feet 
high along the rear and side property lines. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements drew fire from an Arco representative at a council meeting 
last week and from an engineering company that specializes in designing auto 
service stations. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Urquiza, president of Da Vinci Engineering Inc., said the ordinance doesn't 
take into consideration the acreage of individual sites, traffic flow and the 
amount of room needed for a tanker truck to deliver fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Planning Director Kenneth Adams defended the proposed standards, 
saying: "We consider this set of standards a generic set of standards 
applicable across the board," Adams said. GREG HERNANDEZ

FIRE KILLS MAN, 70, GUTS 2-STORY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An elderly man who had become reclusive after his wife's death two months ago 
perished in a fire that gutted his north Santa Ana home Saturday night, 
firefighters and neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters discovered the body of Albert Grenda, 70, lying near a sofa in the 
living room of his two-story house on West Buffalo Avenue. The body was burned 
beyond recognition, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they heard glass breaking shortly after the fire broke out on 
the first floor of the house about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire had blown out the glass" in the windows, said James Broeske, who 
lives across the street from the Grenda home. 
</P>
<P>
Broeske said he was having a party when a neighbor rapped on his door and told 
him that Grenda's house was on fire. "We smashed a window" to gain entry, 
Broeske said, "but by this time, the house was hot and smoky. We tried to push 
open the door to the family room. It was real hot. We couldn't go any farther." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Fire Department spokeswoman Sharon Frank said the first floor was 
"heavily involved" when firefighters arrived on the scene about 10 minutes 
later. It took 25 firefighters about 20 minutes to extinguish the blaze, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said investigators have estimated the damage at $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Grenda's stepson, Bill Francis, said Grenda had become "distraught and 
withdrawn" after his wife died in December. Neighbors said that Grenda did not 
leave the house even to pick up the daily newspapers, which lay in stacks in 
the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said his stepfather had been a buyer with the Fluor Corp. before his 
retirement several years ago. Grenda moved into the house about seven years 
ago, when he married Francis' mother, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very much a loner. I tried to draw him out," said Francis, who is a 
Sheriff's Department lieutenant. "He wouldn't answer the phone or even answer 
the door. I had to respect his privacy." 
</P>
<P>
Frank said investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze.

SPECIAL PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city is now offering seniors free services and low-cost recreational 
programs at the new West Newport Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
The center, at 883 W. 15th St., which used to be a private school, was opened 
and staffed last month to serve seniors living in that area. But few have yet 
come in, said Community Services Coordinator Vicki Chin. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just now aware that we're there," she said. "We are looking to see 
how much interest there is to have these programs available in West Newport." 
</P>
<P>
Activities this month will include blood-pressure tests and vision screening, 
with no appointments necessary. Other services include Medicare counseling and 
income tax assistance. Driving, dancing and exercise classes are also planned.

TONIGHT'S MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-square-mile region of North Orange County and Los Angeles County will be 
sprayed with a pesticide mixture tonight beginning at 9 as part of the state's 
ongoing battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly. The region includes a 
10-square-mile area that was sprayed initially on Nov. 30 and three time since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
The entire region will be sprayed perhaps as many as a dozen times by summer. 
</P>
<P>
The only other spray region in Orange County, covering 36 square miles around 
Garden Grove and Westminster, is scheduled for its second application on 
Thursday, Feb. 15. But lawyers for the cities of Garden Grove , Huntington 
Beach and Westminster will go to court before then to try to get it halted. 
Residents with questions can call the county's Medfly Hotline at 447-7118.

LAWYERS' PAY TALKS SEE LITTLE PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both sides in a labor dispute between county administrators and 300 county 
lawyers say they want to avoid a strike -- and the chaos it could bring to 
already jammed courts. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of last week, there was little hint of progress in salary talks 
for deputy prosecutors, public defenders and county counsel, whose contract 
expired at 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the lawyers' association rejected the last offer, 255 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the Orange County Attorneys Assn. staged a sickout 11 
years ago, county lawyers are working without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
While both sides deny animosity, there is a growing note of bitterness in their 
public comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I first became a city council member and in my time on the board . . . I 
have never seen a less professional organization to deal with," Supervisor 
Roger R. Stanton angrily said about the lawyers' group. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the debate is the association's contention that the county's 
pay for its its legal staff is producing an exodus of experience and talent 
that has reached crisis proportions. In the last two years, according to 
figures compiled by the association, 100 of the 300 lawyers employed by the 
county have left, in most cases for higher-paying jobs in other counties or in 
the private sector as defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office has lost 51 of its 143 deputies, 
according to the association's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is more effective to have an office of career prosecutors than an 
office of people that come here to get a year or two of training and then join 
the other side," said Christopher J. Evans, a deputy prosecutor and spokesman 
for the association. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries for county lawyers range from about $35,000 a year for the 
least-experienced lawyers to $72,000 for the most senior deputies. The county 
has refused to discuss its last salary offer, but lawyers in the bargaining 
unit have said that the proposed increases range from 3.5% to 13.5%, to be 
spread over the next two years, with the largest raises going to those at the 
lower end of the pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
The association first asked for a raise to bring members more in line with Los 
Angeles County, which pays its senior deputies $94,000 a year. County lawyers 
say they have since lowered their request but decline to specify. 
</P>
<P>
The county's offer, Evans said, would do little to stem the attrition within 
the county's legal staff: "We could not stand a similar attrition rate during 
this contract period. It would be difficult to do the job the taxpayers and the 
citizens want us to do to protect them from crime." 
</P>
<P>
County negotiators dismiss such warnings as hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
David M. Carlaw, chief of county employee relations, estimated the turnover 
rate among county lawyers last year at 14%, which he said was just slightly 
higher than the countywide average of 10%. Carlaw said the association's 
numbers are higher because they include those who have been promoted to other 
jobs and those hired temporarily, who then left. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty close" to the countywide attrition rate, Carlaw said. "A 
certain amount of turnover is to be expected in any organization." 
</P>
<P>
Evans insists that his association's figures are correct. As for those who have 
left after being hired for a temporary assignment, Evans said many permanent 
attorneys are classified as temporary so that the county does not have to pay 
them benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't just come and go like grape (pickers)," Evans said. "It's not like 
we expect a lot of drunk drivers one year, so we hire some migrant D.A.s." 
</P>
<P>
Recent court decisions have raised questions about whether county prosecutors 
and public defenders could legally strike. And both sides dismiss the 
possibility of a strike as remote. 
</P>
<P>
County deputy prosecutors and public defenders staged a sickout for several 
days in July, 1979. It had little effect on criminal cases, which were handled 
by management personnel, but it caused delays in the civil courts. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said that his association started an "impasse resolution account" about a 
month ago but that it is a misnomer to call it a strike fund. The money has 
been used to pay the mailing and printing costs of keeping members informed of 
the status of talks and the legal fees of the attorneys representing the 
association at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
The money could be used, Evans conceded, to help members who participate in a 
future job action. "We have no immediate plans for a strike," Evans said. 
"We're not going to predict the future. We're hopeful and confident a 
settlement can be worked out." ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR

MANY COLLEGE FOOTBALL RECRUITS DON'T WAIT FOR DEADLINE TO SELECT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was serenaded by the Trojan marching band and wooed by UCLA Coach Terry 
Donahue and several other of the best college football programs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
For the last month, Hartwell Brown of Los Alamitos High School heard more 
recruiting pitches than a potential Marine. Football coaches and recruiters 
called day and night. Letters flooded his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
Then, it all came to an end last week. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound defensive end, is one of 24 Orange County football 
players who have orally committed to a college and plan to sign national 
letters of intent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed the recruiting process," Brown said. "Some players say they get sick 
of it but that wasn't the case with me. But it is a relief to get all this over 
with. I spent four weekends in a row on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford won a close battle for Brown, one of the most widely recruited players 
on the West Coast. He orally committed to Stanford on Feb. 5 after a weekend 
visit to USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pleased with the (recruiting) experience," Brown said. "One of my 
fondest memories was having a one-on-one breakfast with Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
"During my trip to USC, we were having lunch at a club on campus and the 
marching band came in, lined up along the wall and started playing for us. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very impressive. They finished with (the song) 'Conquest' and I was 
sitting there going 'Wow.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the Trojan fight song wasn't enough to lure Brown to USC. 
</P>
<P>
After his recruiting trip, he discussed options with his parents. He narrowed 
his choices to USC, UCLA and Stanford. Then USC and Stanford. Then just 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Stanford will win and the academics are very, very strong," Brown 
said. "I felt comfortable with the coaches and players when I visited there. I 
had a gut feeling I would be going there after my visit." 
</P>
<P>
That "gut feeling" also told Brown to turn down offers from Notre Dame, 
Colorado, Nebraska, California, Washington State, Arizona State, Oregon, Oregon 
State, Arizona, Northwestern, Fresno State and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
Why all the interest? 
</P>
<P>
Take a look at his resume: 
</P>
<P>
 -- SuperPrep magazine's defensive player of the year in the Far West region. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sixty-three tackles, seven sacks and two fumble recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A score of 1,330 out of a possible 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 -- National Football Foundation scholar-athlete award winner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Times' All-County first team. 
</P>
<P>
Max Emfinger, a Houston-based college scout, said Brown "is one of the best 
defensive linemen in the country." 
</P>
<P>
"Brown is definitely the best on the West Coast," Emfinger said. "He has 
everything you want -- good size, speed and has good numbers on his (college) 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
"He came out of nowhere this season. He's not on any of the preseason lists, 
but he's on everyone's now." 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned Wednesday, Brown will join El Toro quarterback Steve 
Stenstrom, the county's leading passer last season, at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Emfinger said the oral commitments are usually kept, although a few players 
change their mind on signing day. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the kids who go into this weekend with commitments, 95% will stay with 
their (original) decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If that's the case, then Oregon has fared the best in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Nine county players listed Oregon among their final choices and four have 
orally committed to the Ducks -- Mater Dei's Danny O'Neil (quarterback) and 
Kealii Clifford (running back), El Toro's David Cuttrell (offensive lineman) 
and Mission Viejo's Mark Slymen (defensive lineman). 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, 6-2 and 175 pounds, was fourth in the county in passing, completing 132 
of 210 attempts for 1,929 yards and 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good opportunity for me," O'Neil said. "Oregon's a program on the 
rise. I turned down a couple of good places in USC and Alabama, but I had to go 
where I felt I belonged." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil said he might compete for playing time as a freshman with the Ducks, who 
were 8-4 last season and tied for second in the Pacific 10 with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon beat out traditional powers USC and Alabama for O'Neil's commitment. 
Cuttrell plucked the Ducks from a list that included USC, UCLA and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Emfinger figured Oregon's passing game has a certain appeal. Also, USC and UCLA 
are set with quarterbacks Todd Marinovich and Bret Johnson, so "all the good 
quarterbacks in California had to go elsewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's just what Los Alamitos quarterback Todd Gragnano did. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano is one of three county players who has orally committed to Nebraska. 
The others are Los Alamitos linebacker Brian Havens and Esperanza offensive 
lineman Brenden Stai. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's a dropback passer, Gragnano said he wouldn't have any problems 
fitting into Nebraska's run-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano, 6-2, 181 pounds, threw for 2,315 yards and 19 touchdowns last season 
and etched a place in the Orange County record books. 
</P>
<P>
His 6,140 career passing yards are fifth in Southern Section history and third 
on the all-time county list behind Capistrano Valley's Marinovich (9,182) and 
El Toro's Johnson (6,627). 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Gragnano was great from the start," Emfinger said. "Nebraska thinks 
he's the quarterback of the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time Nebraska has signed a big-time passing quarterback. 
They're always looking for an option guy who can run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel he will be a dominant player. He has a strong arm and he's one of 
top quarterbacks on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos sent four players to Division I programs -- Gragnano, Brown, 
Havens and running back Erik Mitchell (Colorado) -- more than any other Orange 
County high school. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei has three players who committed: O'Neil, offensive lineman Ryan 
Motherway (UCLA) and linebacker Ryan Walton (Northern Arizona). Corona del Mar, 
Mission Viejo and Esperanza each have two. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills linebacker Andy Marrone had a good time on his recruiting trip to 
Nevada Las Vegas. Although he's under the legal gambling age of 21, he managed 
to slip a few coins in the slot machines on The Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost about $10," he said. "We cruised The Strip a bunch of times on the 
first night. We went on a tour of the campus the next day and saw the 
UNLV-North Carolina State basketball game. It was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Incredible enough for him to orally commit to the Rebels last week.

CAL STATE FULLERTON SHUTS OUT UCLA IN SOFTBALL

<TEXT>
<P>
Before Cal State Fullerton's softball game against top-ranked UCLA Sunday, 
starting pitcher Ann Van Dorchert told Coach Judi Garman that she felt ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her, 'Great, that's when you usually pitch your best games because you 
are so worried about being sick that your concentration on pitching is better,' 
" Garman said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dorchert left the UCLA hitters feeling ill, pitching a three-hit, 2-0 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the fourth-ranked Titans a four-game split in the Big 
West-Pacific 10 Showdown, a tournament featuring six top-20 ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Van Dorchert did a nice job today of keeping us off-balance," UCLA Coach 
Sharon Backus said. "Give all the credit to the Titans." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton topped No. 15 Arizona State, 3-2, in its first game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Against UCLA, Titan center fielder Mich DeBree, who earned all-tournament 
honors, had the key hit in the second inning. Her line-drive single to center 
drove in the only two runs of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dorchert took care of the rest, improving her record to 2-1, and giving 
Fullerton some much needed confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Against UCLA yesterday, some of the players were scared to death," Garman 
said. "But it will give you confidence when you beat the No. 1 team in a 
well-played game. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, and Ann's only a sophomore," Garman said. "Here we are handing her the 
ball for the big game with UCLA, telling her she's our No. 1 pitcher and she's 
supposed to carry the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, Ann proved that she can handle those big games." 
</P>
<P>
Pitching depth could be a problem for Fullerton this season, with only Van 
Dorchert, sophomore Shireen Campbell, who started only four games last season, 
and freshman Tracy Tousley available. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton's offense features two returning first-team All-Americans, senior 
right fielder Carey Hess (team-high .409 batting average, 52 runs scored) and 
senior first baseman Missy Coombes (.359 batting average, team-high 29 runs 
batted in). 
</P>
<P>
The Titans also returned 12 of 16 players from a squad that had a team average 
of .267 last season and averaged more than three runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
"This tournament showed us what areas we need to work on in practice," Garman 
said. "I feel pretty good right now, and I think if Ann's healthy, we can beat 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific 10 wrestling: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield 29, Cal State Fullerton 6 -- Lyndon Campbell won a 5-3 
decision at 134 pounds and Ramon Diza won a 3-1 decision at 177 pounds for 
visiting Fullerton.

Eighth-inning hits by Josh Bammer and Gary Christopherson helped Golden West 
College defeat Cypress, 12-5, in the championship game of the Cypress baseball 
tournament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West led, 6-1, after five innings, but Cypress rallied for two runs in 
the sixth, and two more in the seventh to pull within 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (5-1) then bounced back in the eighth and ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Steve McKowen walked to open the eighth and Gerad Cawhorn walked one out later. 
Bammer singled to left field, scoring McKowen. Christopherson then doubled to 
the fence in left, scoring Cawhorn and Bammer, and Golden West led, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West then scored three runs in the ninth on McKowen's sacrifice fly, an 
RBI double by Cawhorn and a Cypress error. 
</P>
<P>
Errors proved to be the downfall for Cypress (8-2), which committed five that 
led to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West scored three unearned runs in the third for a 5-0 lead. With one 
out, Bammer reached base on Cypress shortstop Jason Bates' throwing error. 
Christopherson then singled and, after an out, Mike Willey tripled to right to 
drive in two runs. Willey scored when second baseman Troy Babbitt's relay throw 
to third went out of play. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Henderson (1-0), making his first collegiate start, allowed six hits and 
three runs, two earned, in 5 2/3 innings for the victory. He also had seven 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Ogle had two strikeouts and didn't allow a hit in the final two innings 
for the save. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Puppe had three hits for Cypress. Losing pitcher Noe Najera (2-1) allowed 
six runs, three earned, in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
In the San Diego Southwestern tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago 10, Los Angeles Harbor 3 -- Conrad Colby had four hits and 
scored two runs to help Rancho Santiago win the tournament championship. Steve 
Grack, Marty Neff and Rob Reimers each had two hits and two RBIs for the Dons 
(7-0). Rancho Santiago scored three runs in the second and five in the third 
for an 8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Hassel (2-0) pitched the first five innings for the victory, and Chris 
Floth pitched the final four innings for the save.

Now here's a good idea for an exhibit: Round up a bunch of artists who have 
dreamed up new ways of interpreting an old subject -- landscape -- and find a 
fiction writer to embroider some vivid landscape-related reveries for the 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, everything depends on who the artists and writer are and what, if 
anything, they have to say. Make the wrong choices and you wind up with a show 
as disappointing as "Insistent Landscapes," at the Security Pacific Art Gallery 
through April 1. 
</P>
<P>
In a vaguely worded foreword to the catalogue, curator Mark Johnstone says the 
six East Coast and West Coast artists in the show "use powerful psychological 
aspects of technique or choice and treatment of subject matter." Powerful, 
pshaw -- the power here wouldn't run an electric toothbrush. For the most part, 
the paintings register either a pasteurized, yuppie version of Angst or a 
desperate attempt to be outrageous. Even Terry Wolverton's essay is little more 
than a collection of cliches about memory and landscape and art, presented in 
tiny post-modernist sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Tobi Kahn reduces landscape features to uniformly textured, soberly colored 
basic shapes. In "Alohm II," three oval black islands poke into a burnt sienna 
lake. In "Ehlak II," vaguely triangular black mounds appear in a deep V-shaped 
valley between a pair of umber hills. These spare little works seem too neatly 
resolved; they lack the elements of surprise and tension that would give the 
images more presence. 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Teague-Cooper paints objects that hover in an empty world: broken bones 
floating over a transparent curving orange body of water; a dunce's hat 
airlifted above a sparse outcropping of trees; a tree plummeting through black 
space. Again, it's easy enough to figure out what the work is supposed to 
suggest -- a surreal state of mysterious tension and foreboding. But the 
juxtaposition of mundane objects and vast, colorful space is too pat and cute 
and, frankly, unoriginal to suggest larger issues. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Gygli King attempts to set the tradition of easel landscape on its ear 
by adding hunks of three-dimensional materials to flesh out her garish painted 
landscapes and enclosing them in flamboyantly carved glittery and painted 
frames, some of which rest on equally loud-mouthed easels. 
</P>
<P>
With titles such as "Southampton Salad" and "Coastal Front," these paintings 
are conveyances for all sorts of flotsam: plastic tomatoes, carved swaths of 
drapery, carved shells and unidentifiable stuff that oozes from the painted sea 
onto the frame. These resemble a prescient allusion to the garbage that washed 
ashore on New York beaches last year, after these works were painted. 
</P>
<P>
But King's works ultimately straddle the fence: They are are too campy to be 
taken seriously but they aren't outrageous enough to be a real menace to the 
polite fictions of landscape painting. 
</P>
<P>
Also represented in the exhibit are works by Jean Towgood, who reduces 
landscape imagery into unremarkable patterns of scribbly brush strokes, and 
Richard Sedivy, whose blend of landscape and architectural imagery was reviewed 
here for his show at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery last month. (Those works 
demonstrated a considerably greater range than the pieces at Security Pacific.) 
</P>
<P>
By far the best works in the show are by Los Angeles painter Lawrence Gipe. For 
one thing, they are pleasingly substantial paintings, with commanding 
compositions and a richly evocative use of paint. More important, perhaps, 
given the context of this show, are the big, meaty themes Gipe favors. In these 
black-and-yellow images of railways and industrial landscapes, unabashed 
nostalgia for icons of the industrial age mingles with a brooding concern for 
the fate of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"Diptych for Krupp" is a luminous quayside scene framed by the silhouettes of 
smokestacks and tanks. The smoke and gases wafting through the soft lights 
blanket the night sky with an apricot haze -- the painter's homage to the 
Impressionists, who created their atmospheric landscape imagery under the 
shadow of increasing urbanization and pollution. (In some paintings by Monet, 
for example, the air is colored by the byproducts of industrialization.) 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of Gipe's painting, the colloquial German phrase "Wo gehobelt 
wird, da fallen Spane" is painted in red. It means, "You can't make an omelet 
without breaking some eggs." The bitter reference is to the activities of 
Krupp, the giant steel company founded in the early 19th Century that became 
known as "the arsenal of the Reich" after it supplied guns for the 
Franco-Prussian War. During World War II, the firm plundered property and 
plants in occupied countries and used concentration camp inmates to manufacture 
steel weaponry. Owner Alfried Krupp was convicted of war crimes at the 
Nuremberg Tribunal after the war, but the company soon recovered its economic 
clout. It seems symptomatic of the superficiality of the show that no effort 
was made in the catalogue to explore the specifics of any of Gipe's paintings. 
The wall labels don't even offer translations of the German words. 
</P>
<P>
The new piece in the gallery Project Room (through July 29) is Michael 
McMillen's baffling "Train of Thought" installation. As you walk down an angled 
corridor, you encounter a mirror, an old sash window mounted high on the wall, 
and a tall, thin wood construction. Then you enter a mock-up of a seedy room 
with useless pipes and wires on the walls and yellow rust stains running down 
the faded floral wallpaper. A book called "Practical Engineering" is anchored 
to a table with wire. A stained lab coat hangs on a hook, and an upside-down 
globe rests on a glass case filled with various items that include a skull, a 
dried rose, a mannequin's hand clutching a revolver, a baby bottle nipple and a 
100-peso bill that says it was issued by the Japanese government. 
</P>
<P>
After examining these items -- most of them either old or bogus, or both -- you 
can sit in an armchair and contemplate the workings of yet another curiousity: 
a conveyor belt contraption mounted on tall scaffolding somewhat like a 
railroad trestle. The machine drops a steady trickle of tiny alphabet pasta 
onto the floor, where it forms a golden hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Train of Thought" appears to have been intended as a meditation about time, 
history and memory. The image of a train moving over great distances and the 
mind stringing together free associations come together in a pleasing way. In 
the piece, the ever-growing mound of fallen letters -- the building blocks of 
language -- marks the passage of hours and days. But the letters have no more 
meaning than the grains of sand in an hourglass. Time, it seems, can turn even 
language to meaningless dust. The stains on the wall are traces of processes 
that occurred in some unspecified past. 
</P>
<P>
But the jumble of items in the case and the other miscellaneous objects in the 
room -- including what appear to be wartime photographs of a skeleton with a 
rifle -- don't have a readily decipherable common denominator. Fakery, death, 
health concerns, war, engineering -- it just doesn't add up. You sit there 
willing the piece to reveal itself, and it remains bundled up in an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insistent Landscapes" continues at Security Pacific Gallery, 555 Anton Blvd., 
Costa Mesa, through April 1. Michael McMillen's "Train of Thought" installation 
remains through July 29. The gallery is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 11 
a.m. to 5 p.m.. Admission is free and parking is validated. Information: (714) 
433-6000.

SPECIAL REPORT: OIL ON THE BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
A POSTCARD-PERFECT SHORELINE IS SMUDGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The oil spilled into the sea and the wind delivered it to our shores in 
teasing, grimy licks or in steady waves of foaming filth. 
</P>
<P>
It crept in slowly, tauntingly, then retreated with the tide, loitering, as if 
deciding where it would strike next. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 400,000 gallons of crude that poured from the wounded hull of the 
American Trader soiled the sands in Newport Beach, Huntington Beach and, 
irregularly, to the north. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, volunteers and those paid to do a job, turned out to mop it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse's aide Michelle Vale of Costa Mesa was barefoot and bent at the waist, 
her pants rolled to her knees, as she blotted the sand near the Newport Pier 
with what looked like a thick paper towel. She'd been that way for about three 
hours; she was cold and wet. Her back ached. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved out here from Arizona because my husband wanted to be by the ocean," 
she said. "And here we have a tragedy on our hands. We have to be here. . . . 
We are already in trouble with the environment. The Valdez was one warning. We 
chose to ignore it. This has got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Vale went on with her task, an unarmed sentry, keeping an eye on the sea gulls 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's environmental tragedy was at once communal and personal. People 
bemoaned it, seethed with the news of it. Shock mushroomed into anger and 
later, to sadness and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from where Vale worked, two tall, long-haired men marched with 
placards, silently defiant, as if they were picketing the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"Idiots Rule," read one of the signs. "Save our Environment!" said the other. 
</P>
<P>
"When I grow up I want to be a marine biologist and a writer," said 13-year-old 
Misty Mallory, picking up bits of petroleum debris on the Newport shore. "I 
want to write about marine conservation and about how they are messing it up. 
This really makes me mad!" 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rhodes was standing just outside the entrance to the beachfront house 
where he has lived for 15 years as he watched the strange parade before him 
with a Budweiser at hand. He used binoculars to see past all the television 
trailers and from there, out into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have been very lucky," he said. "We take where we live for granted. 
The oil companies, I don't think they really care. All they're worried about is 
their big bucks; the rest can go to hell." 
</P>
<P>
A little farther south, however, the slow, jagged spread of the crude seemed to 
make this environmental calamity more amorphous. Here, the media did not 
cluster and the view from the luxury homes was much the same. 
</P>
<P>
Roller skaters still zoomed along the shorefront sidewalk, joggers and 
bicyclists too. Boys played basketball on the asphalt court off beachfront 
Newport Elementary School. One fiddled with a sailboard in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
Still, word of the tragedy seemed to be on everyone's lips. 
</P>
<P>
Justin Torres' third-grade classroom from Newport Elementary made a field trip 
to the pier to see if the boys and girls could help with the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"The fumes were too strong, so they wouldn't let us help," Justin said. "This 
oil is really bad. It kills animals or it gets them all sick, and then we can't 
go into the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
And Natalie Turpen, talking with a friend at the 15th St. Surf Shop, said she 
would never forget the bird that she saw the other night. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't even move his wings, they were so soaked with oil," she said. "I 
just watched him drown. It makes me feel so bad." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the sight of contract workers along the beach, looming like some odd 
sort of extraterrestrials in yellow slickers and pink hard hats, that seemed 
the surest sign that something wasn't quite right. 
</P>
<P>
The men moved in small groups, past the signs that read "Danger Beach Closed." 
They poked at the sand for hardened globs of crude that they tucked into long 
plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
They moved slowly, some hardly at all. This for them was only a job, paid at 
$7.50 an hour. They were pulling down 12-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these guys, they're just here 'cause they get paid," said one of the 
workers. "We've got 45 guys right here. If they had been picking up the stuff 
earlier, we wouldn't have to look for these chips right now." 
</P>
<P>
The mood changed, dramatically, at Huntington Beach. It was desperation, 
underlined with outrage and fear. The delicate ecological sanctuary of the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands might yet be in the oil's path. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, a lifeguard-storage garage converted into an avian hospital was 
overburdened with oil-drenched birds, stunned and lucky to be alive, who were 
kept quiet and fed. Later they would be washed. 
</P>
<P>
"It upsets me because all of this was caused by man," said Amy Sano, a senior 
at the city's Marina High School who stood watching a bulldozer tear up 
oil-sprinkled sand near Huntington pier. "And it's the animals who are paying 
for this." 
</P>
<P>
Sano and her classmate, Jenny Satler, stayed out of school for two days so that 
they could lend a hand. "When I have kids, I don't want to say, 'Gee, this is 
where our beach used to be,' " Satler said. 
</P>
<P>
The girls were angered, however, that authorities refused to let them help as 
much as they would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to stay 50 feet from the shore," Satler said. "They wouldn't even let 
us go in and get birds that were there! One woman was so upset that she was 
crying. She threw down her box and left. She had to watch a bird die because 
they wouldn't let her get it. They said they were busy with other things." 
</P>
<P>
Emotions ran high too among those helping to take charge. Huntington Beach 
lifeguard Rick Reisenhofer said he feared that it could take years to really 
clean up the mess, much of it invisible to those on land. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we were just playing the odds," he said. "You have all this tanker 
traffic here. . . . That's 20/20 hindsight, I know. . . . Accidents happen."

AT 16, YOUNGEST VOLUNTEER AT HUNTINGTON BEACH BIRD-RESCUE CENTER.

<P>
Brian Leanza was young, as bird rescuers go -- looking better suited for a 
Motley Crue concert than a rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
At 16, Brian was the youngest volunteer at the Huntington Beach bird-rescue 
center. 
</P>
<P>
In a heavy black leather jacket and faded black jeans, wearing a silver dagger 
earring and rough whiskers, he seemed out of place on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
But since Wednesday, Brian had built bird pens, held down birds as they were 
cleaned, nailed down floor mats and crumpled newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile for the birds by being here," he 
said, taking a 15-minute break. "The birds look so tired. They look like they 
need all the help they can get. So I'm here for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of birds as people," said Brian, who wants to be a game warden or a 
narcotics officer. "I kind of feel responsible for them, because I think if I 
were in some sort of trouble the birds would try to help me out." Brian heard 
of the oil spill from his aunt, a wildlife biologist for the State Department 
of Fish and Game. Since arriving at the center Wednesday night, he has stopped 
only to go home to Orange for sleep. He doesn't plan to stop working until the 
danger has passed. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday and Friday, Brian hitched rides at 5:30 a.m. from his aunt. As a 
sophomore taking independent study at Parkside High School, he says he is not 
missing any classes. 
</P>
<P>
It had been 36 hours since the spill and Brian admitted that he was tired. His 
hands were marked with tiny scratches and blackened from crumbling newspapers 
for the western grebes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only when I stop moving that I feel it in my legs the most," Brian said. 
"But it's all right. Maybe I'm too tired to be tired." LILY ENG

ON SHORES OF CONGRESS, SPILL EXPECTED TO ADD TO RIPPLE EFFECT OF OUTRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the hull of the American Trader was ripped open with its own anchor last 
week and crude oil surged into Southern California's coastal waters, the 
ripples could be felt all the way to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the 400,000-gallon Huntington Beach spill, the oil industry had 
been fighting a tidal wave of congressional outrage stirred by the 11-million 
gallon Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska last March. 
</P>
<P>
Congress had delayed consideration of the industry's plans for exploratory 
drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve and Bristol Bay. It also voted 
last September to impose a blanket moratorium on new drilling off California 
until July. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as a congressional conference committee prepares to iron out differences 
later this month between House and Senate bills that would take the lid off 
financial liability limits for oil spillers and require expensive double hulls 
and bottoms for oil tankers, Big Oil is in for yet another bruising battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of the Alaskan spill was enormous. The follow-up spill this week at 
Newport Beach within helicopter distance of every major media outlet in Los 
Angeles is going to reinforce the emotion," Richard W. Lewis, a Washington 
D.C.-based Chevron, U.S.A. lobbyist said a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Palmer of the American Ocean Campaign, which has been fighting offshore 
oil drilling, added, "I think this will put the political pressure on even 
more. It's clearly the kind of accident that could have been lessened or 
prevented with a double hull tanker." 
</P>
<P>
But proponents of tougher liability laws and double hulls still don't 
underestimate the oil industry's determination to push members of the 
conference committee for favorable provisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be nip and tuck even with the record floor votes and the spill 
because it represents a tremendous cost to the oil industry and they're going 
to fight it," Lynda Schuler, an aide to Sen. Pete Wilson, said. 
</P>
<P>
Both the House and Senate bills, approved earlier on overwhelming votes, would 
create a $1 billion national fund -- financed by a new tax on oil -- to pay for 
oil spill damages and would place the U.S. Coast Guard in charge of 
coordinating cleanup activities. 
</P>
<P>
Both bills would also remove the limit on how much an oil spiller would have to 
pay in damages if a spill resulted from "gross negligence, willful misconduct 
or failure to observe navigation or safety laws . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Barring such failures, however, a tanker's liability would be limited, 
depending on its size. The House would sharply raise existing limits of $150 
per ton to $1,200 per ton for any accident. The Senate would raise the limit to 
$1,000 per ton or $10 million, whichever was greater. 
</P>
<P>
The House version of the bill, approved Nov. 1, would require double bottoms, 
hulls and sides on all new tankers and barges. It also would require existing 
tankers and barges to be retrofitted with double bottoms within 7 years if they 
are in excess of 20,000 tons, and double hulls within 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate bill would require double hulls and bottoms on new tanks only if the 
secretary of transportation determines within a year of the bill's passage that 
the extra construction would result in "a net enhancement of oil tanker 
navigation safety." A study that could help settle that issue is due in 
November by the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Huntington Beach spill, in the view of environmentalists, argues 
persuasively for the tougher House version. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to make it a lot harder for industry to say the Senate bill is a 
better way to go," said Clifton E. Curtis, executive director of the Oceanic 
Society in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, legislation is moving in the California Legislature as well. A bill 
by Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo) would impose a 50-cent fee on each 
barrel of oil shipped to the state to underwrite a $500 million oil spill 
response fund. The money also would be used to strengthen the state Fish and 
Game Department's oil spill response office. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to the proposed federal legislation, the Lempert measure -- strongly 
backed by state Controller Gray Davis and Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy -- would 
require tankers in California waters to be double-hulled, would levy a 
$10-per-gallon fine for any oil spills and a $30-per-gallon fine for spills 
caused by willful misconduct or negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Several authorities have suggested that had the American Trader been built with 
a double hull, last Wednesday's spill may have been much less extensive or 
averted altogether. Earlier, a Coast Guard study indicated that spillage from 
the Exxon Valdez would have been reduced by 80% if it had had a double bottom, 
according to Sen. Brock Adams (D-Wash). 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach spill poses political problems for President Bush as well 
as the oil industry. The White House is due to announce soon its decision on 
whether to support a permanent or longer-term moratorium on offshore oil and 
gas drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that particularly in light of the Huntington Beach spill we should be 
able to muster the voters to extend the moratorium another year," said Schuler 
of Wilson's office. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be expedient for the President to agree to Congress' intent. 
Secondly, it would be a real signal to the country and and the environmental 
community that Bush does intend to live up to his pledge to be an 
environmentalist," she said.

SURFACE-DIVING BIRDS MOST VULNERABLE TO OIL; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: SPILL COULD ALSO HARM PRIMARY FOOD SOURCES FOR COUNTLESS MIGRATING 
BIRDS AND THE ENDANGERED LIGHT-FOOTED CLAPPER RAIL IF IT ENTERS SENSITIVE 
WETLANDS AREAS.

<P>
Each fall, the distinctive black-and-white western grebe wings south from its 
breeding grounds in Alaska to winter off the coast of Southern California and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of the birds bob in the waters off Orange County, where they are 
joined by other surface-diving sea birds: common murres and several species of 
scoter. 
</P>
<P>
These birds are the most vulnerable to the floating oil released Wednesday by 
the ruptured tanker American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
"Grebes and murres spend most of their time sitting on the water, so they're 
highly vulnerable to oil," said Michael Fry, a research physiologist in the 
avian sciences department at UC Davis. And because oil is not a natural aspect 
of the birds' environment, they don't know to avoid it. In fact, Fry said, the 
oil has a flattening effect on the water that may actually attract the birds as 
they fly in search of choice feeding locations. 
</P>
<P>
Fry has seen his share of oil-soaked birds. He oversaw the pathological study 
of birds killed by last year's spill off Valdez, Alaska, in which an estimated 
30,000 sea birds and 127 bald eagles died. 
</P>
<P>
There are two life-threatening problems that occur when a bird's feathers are 
fouled with oil. 
</P>
<P>
First, a bird will try to clean itself with its bill, called "preening," thus 
ingesting some of the oil. "They do eat substantial quantities of the oil when 
they're trying to get it off their feathers," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil, such as that spilled off Huntington Beach, has a certain percentage 
of gasoline that gradually evaporates. If swallowed, it can cause serious 
damage to liver and kidneys. The oil itself causes anemia in the birds, which 
can lose half to two-thirds of their red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
through the body. For diving birds, which must hold their breath to feed, that 
can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
The other main problem is that the oil mats the feathers, interfering with the 
bird's ability to float and to insulate itself from the cold waters. The body 
temperature drops, and the bird can die from hypothermia, or can literally 
starve to death as its metabolism increases to make up for the escaping heat. 
</P>
<P>
The oil spill can effect other aspects of the marine food chain, down to its 
most basic elements. If the spill enters any of the county's sensitive wetlands 
areas, it could smother the invertebrates that live in the ground. These are 
the primary food source for shore birds, including the endangered light-footed 
clapper rail, which nests in Anaheim Bay and Upper Newport Bay, and the myriad 
migrating birds that depend on the wetlands as vital refueling stops on their 
long journeys. 
</P>
<P>
"In the long term, I don't think things are going to be disastrous" if some oil 
enters the marshes, said Louann Murray, a specialist in wetland invertebrates 
and a member of Amigos de Bolsa Chica. Microbes in the mud will eventually 
break down the oil that isn't scooped out, and the marsh will eventually 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
The short-term effects, however, could be disastrous for the migrating birds 
and especially for the clapper rail. Half of the remaining clapper rails in the 
United States live in Upper Newport Bay, and "could be wiped out by this 
spill," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
If the oil hits tide pools, the results could also be devastating, according to 
Harry Helling of the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point. "There's 
nothing you can do to rescue a tide pool," Helling said. 
</P>
<P>
In the ocean waters near shore, mussels and snails can ingest the oil without 
apparent harm. But it accumulates in their systems, and can contaminate the 
birds that feed on them, such as harlequin and goldeneye ducks and oyster 
catchers. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs and young fish are vulnerable, but because this is not breeding season, 
adult fish won't be severely impacted. However, if the oil settles to the 
bottom it could kill such bottom-dwelling fish as halibut. 
</P>
<P>
In Alaska, sea otters -- which depend on their fur for insulation -- were the 
biggest victims of the spill among marine mammals. Otters no longer live off 
the Orange County coast, but there are numbers of California sea lions, 
bottle-nose and common dolphins and the migrating gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
Large mammals are usually able to escape the oil, says Jacqui Michel, a South 
Carolina-based scientific consultant who worked the Valdez spill and is heading 
to Orange County. While evidence is inconclusive, the oil does not seem to 
stick to the skin of whales and dolphins when they swim through. 
</P>
<P>
One concern is that dolphins, which accumulate toxins in their systems, may 
suffer long-term effects if they eat fish contaminated by the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Overall though, some experts are optimistic that wildlife off the Orange County 
coast will not suffer major long-term consequences if the spill is kept out of 
wetlands and other inlets. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to say it, but in the grand scheme of things, if you had to have a 
spill, this was the time and the place," said state biologist Robin Lewis, who 
is helping assess potential environmental damage for the state Department of 
Fish and Game. "A month later, a few miles farther to the south, in that rocky 
reach near Corona del Mar and Laguna, and it would have taken years to 
recover."

Here are descriptions of five birds threatened by the oil spill off Huntington 
Beach, shown above from left. 
</P>
<P>
Western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis) 
</P>
<P>
Because it spends most of its time on the surface of coastal waters, this 
wintering bird is among the most vulnerable to the early effects of a spill. 
</P>
<P>
California least tern (Sterna antillarum browni) 
</P>
<P>
This endangered gull-like bird nests on the sand in wetlands such as Bolsa 
Chica. Now wintering farther south, its nesting grounds would be threatened if 
oil enters the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) 
</P>
<P>
This endangered bird flies along the surface and dives for fish; at least two 
have been found with their feathers covered with oil. 
</P>
<P>
Common murre (Uria aalge) 
</P>
<P>
Like the grebe, this sea bird bobs on the water's surface, diving occasionally 
for fish. 
</P>
<P>
Light-footed clapper rail (Rallus longirostris levipes) 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the state's population of this sedentary marsh bird lives in 
the dense cordgrass stands of Upper Newport Bay. Any damage to this nesting 
site would be devastating to the bird's future prospects.

BUSH SAYS HE IS BOUND BY SANCTIONS

President Bush said today he will not lift any sanctions against South Africa 
-- despite the release of Nelson R. Mandela and other signs of moderation -- 
until Pretoria meets all conditions set by U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do that," Bush said at a news conference when asked if he would 
modify any economic curbs against South Africa on the basis of recent 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bound by the law. What I do want to do is discuss these provisions with 
Mr. Mandela and (South African President Frederik W.) de Klerk," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Both have been invited to meet with Bush in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bush acknowledged that he finds some sanctions counterproductive but noted that 
under the U.S. law establishing sanctions in 1986, a number of specific 
conditions must be met before sanctions can be changed or lifted. 
</P>
<P>
They include the release of all political prisoners, the lifting of a state of 
emergency, negotiation with the black majority, permission for blacks to live 
and work where they please and freedom for political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would broker negotiations between Mandela and De Klerk similar 
to those of former President Jimmy Carter in the Camp David Middle East 
accords, he said he would if the two parties feel it would be "helpful." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, his brief telephone conversations with the two men indicated 
to him that they could likely negotiate on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Bush praised De Klerk for taking steps that "move South Africa down the road 
toward racial equality." 
</P>
<P>
"I think his coming here evidences that we see in him a new brand of 
leadership," the President said of De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
On another subject, Bush rejected Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposal 
that U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe be cut to equal levels, saying that he 
wants to get away from such direct "linkage" in the size of troop 
concentrations. 
</P>
<P>
Bush defended his proposal that the United States be allowed to keep a total of 
225,000 troops in Europe while Moscow would be limited to 195,000, and rejected 
Gorbachev's counterproposal that the numbers be equal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to stay with our proposal because we don't see this linkage. . . . 
We've got a big ocean between us and Western Europe," he said in explaining why 
the United States should be allowed slightly higher troop levels. 
</P>
<P>
In his State of the Union address, Bush proposed that the United States and 
Soviet Union be limited to 195,000 troops in central Europe, but that the 
United States be allowed to keep another 30,000 troops in other European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow now has about 570,000 troops in Europe and the United States has about 
305,000 troops on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Bush opened the news conference with praise for talks by Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III in Moscow last weekend with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
He said Baker made "solid progress" on arms control issues that should lead to 
a successful summit meeting between himself and Gorbachev in Washington in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
On a related issue, Bush took note of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 
weekend talks with Gorbachev and said a reunified Germany should be a member of 
NATO.

Four robbery suspects leaving a McDonald's restaurant in Sunland after tying up 
the manager were confronted by nine police officers early today, resulting in a 
gun battle in which three suspects were killed and one wounded, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the officers involved in the northern Los Angeles shoot-out were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The gun battle occurred about 1:30 a.m., said Police Lt. William Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers had been followed by undercover officers investigating a rash of 
McDonald's restaurant robberies, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
"The doors were locked," Hall said. "We don't know how they got in, but (the 
manager) didn't let them in. They tied her up and forced her to provide the 
combination to the safe." 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified manager was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
A Holy Cross Hospital nursing supervisor would not give the condition of the 
wounded suspect.

A federal judge today delayed the start of John M. Poindexter's Iran-Contra 
trial by two weeks but said he will proceed with plans to take former President 
Ronald Reagan's videotaped deposition Friday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said that "hopefully" Reagan's testimony 
can be taken in a courtroom of the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The judge rejected a suggestion by the ex-President's lawyers that the 
deposition be taken in a Los Angeles building where Reagan has offices. 
</P>
<P>
One of Poindexter's lawyers, Richard W. Beckler, had urged Greene to put off 
taking Reagan's testimony until the middle of the trial, after Iran-Contra 
prosecutors have presented their case. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to buy that; we are going to proceed," said Greene. 
</P>
<P>
Seven news organizations applied to the court for permission to attend the 
videotaped deposition. They are Cable News Network, Capital Cities-ABC Inc., 
CBS Inc., National Broadcasting Co., The New York Times Co., Times Mirror Co. 
and The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he will rule before Friday on their request, but he said he is 
"doubtful that the press could be there" in view of concerns over the 
possibility of disclosing classified information during the deposition. Such 
material will be edited out of the videotape before it is shown in court at 
Poindexter's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Greene said he is delaying the start of the trial until March 5 to resolve a 
number of other issues, including disagreement concerning about 150 classified 
documents that Poindexter, a former national security adviser to Reagan, wants 
to use at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the dispute over classified material, the judge will have to rule on 
whether the documents are necessary for Poindexter to get a fair trial.

Pakistani troops fired on Indian security forces that stopped a mob of 
Pakistani protesters from storming across the border into disputed Kashmir, 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
At least three demonstrators were killed Sunday night, a Defense Ministry 
spokesman said in Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's state-run TV said the Indian guards killed as many as six. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started after Indian border guards opened fire on hundreds of 
Pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating Pakistan-controlled 
Kashmir from the Indian-held region. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani troops then fired 
about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at Indian border posts in the 
Uri sector. Indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about 
half an hour, the spokesman said. No one was hurt.

flights allowed emerged as a potential stumbling block for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, attending a meeting of the 23 
foreign ministers of the two alliances, warned that Open Skies would work only 
if all countries are allowed an equal amount of flights over each other's 
territory and said information gathered from the flights should be shared. 
</P>
<P>
NATO has proposed a quota system under which the number of flights would be 
based on the size of each country. Under that system, two to three flights a 
week would be allowed over the Soviet Union and only about one a week over the 
United States.

SEN. THURMOND, 87, ANNOUNCES HE WILL RUN FOR HIS 7TH TERM

<P>
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), a living legend in South Carolina and the oldest 
member of Congress at 87, announced today that he will be a candidate for a 
seventh six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The senator was accompanied at a series of news conferences across the state by 
his wife, Nancy, and key political supporters. 
</P>
<P>
A heavy favorite for reelection -- no Democrat has stepped forward to challenge 
him yet -- Thurmond would be 94 at the end of another term, making him the 
oldest member of Congress ever. Sen. Theodore Green of Rhode Island was 93 when 
he retired in 1961 and Sen. Carl Hayden of Arizona was 91 when he retired in 
1969. 
</P>
<P>
Thurmond generally answers questions about his advanced age by pointing to his 
daily physical fitness regimen and challenging anyone to find a candidate in 
better shape. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker, who became the oldest member of Congress when Florida Rep. Claude 
Pepper died last year at the age of 88, indicated that his seniority in the 
Senate would help him better serve his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't elect a man just because of his seniority, but if he has all the 
other qualifications then it should be counted, and it is very helpful," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Thurmond is the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Rep. E. Harold Ford, the only black congressman in Tennessee history, predicted 
acquittal today as he went on trial on charges he took $1.5 million in 
fraudulent bank loans in return for backing a candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, a flamboyant eight-term Democrat who controls a political machine with 
the power to deliver the votes of Tennessee's most populous city, strode 
smiling confidently past reporters into the federal courthouse for the start of 
jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 indictment alleges that Ford took $1.5 million disguised as loans from 
banks controlled by brothers Jake and C. H. Butcher Jr. in 18 payments between 
1976 and 1983. In return, Ford delivered the votes of his congressional 
district to Jake Butcher in the banker's unsuccessful race for governor in 
1978, the indictment says. 
</P>
<P>
Ford maintains the loans were for his legitimate business interests, including 
his family's funeral home.

Declining mortgage rates and lower prices for starter houses gave first-time 
home buyers greater purchasing power during the fourth quarter of last year, 
the National Assn. of Realtors said today. 
</P>
<P>
The association's first-time home buyer affordability index measured 74.4 
during the three-month period ended in December, an improvement from a rating 
of 71 in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That means that typical first-time buyers had 74.4% of the income needed to 
qualify for a starter home. 
</P>
<P>
The relief may be short lived, however, as interest rates have pushed upward 
during the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
John Tuccillo, the association's chief economist, said the return of higher 
interest rates this quarter should make it even more difficult for first-time 
home buyers to qualify for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
First-timers will have to be "more inventive to get into the housing market," 
Tuccillo said.

OUTSIDE HELP SOUGHT BY DREXEL BURNHAM WALL STREET: SECURITIES FIRM BATTERED BY 
CRIMINAL TROUBLES AND SLUMPING JUNK-BOND MARKET. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said today that it is seeking a major investor or 
merger partner after falling on hard times because of its criminal troubles and 
the slumping junk-bond market. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Drexel said senior members of the firm have concluded that it 
should seek outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The unsettled markets, particularly in the high-yield area, have adversely 
affected the liquidity of our parent corporation, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group. 
. . ," Drexel said. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel has long been rumored on Wall Street to be in serious financial 
difficulty and seeking an outside investor or partner. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move would conclude one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Wall Street 
history. Drexel was the emblem of the high-flying, takeover-driven 1980s, and 
the firm made a profit of $522.5 million on revenue of $5.3 billion in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Drexel reported a loss of about $40 million for last year, in which it 
pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid $650 million to the federal government 
to settle wide-ranging securities fraud charges and avoid a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The firm earned more than $400 million in 1987 but reported a loss of $166.7 
million in 1988, which included a charge to cover the $650-million payment to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's net capital position was said to be of concern because a slumping 
capital base could put it in jeopardy with federal regulators. Drexel's equity 
capital has fallen from a peak of $1.4 billion in recent years because of the 
government payments and withdrawal of stakes in the firm by departing 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
The closely held Wall Street firm said today that the parent company has a 
consolidated net worth of more than $800 million. It said the securities 
business subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., "continues to have good 
liquidity and has satisfactory excess regulatory capital." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said it is "taking appropriate action to maximize liquidity" but it did 
not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The firm had been battered by the charges in the government's lengthy 
investigation of Wall Street securities fraud. The inquiry now focuses on the 
former head of Drexel's highly productive high-yield "junk bond" division, 
Michael Milken, who is under indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Before Drexel's troubles mushroomed, Milken reportedly received $550 million in 
total compensation in one single year, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel was also hard hit by the slump in the nation's $210-billion junk bond 
market last fall, which followed the collapse of a takeover deal for United 
Airlines parent UAL Corp. The market has yet to recover, and Drexel had to 
write down the value of its junk-bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said they are not surprised by the announcement, adding 
that they expect Drexel to try to sell a chunk of its business or a general 
stake rather than the entire firm. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if anything is too drastic," said securities industry analyst 
Lawrence Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco. 
"Selling a piece of the firm would be the best way for them to go."

MRS. TRUMP TO GET $20 MILLION AND CHILDREN

Real estate developer Donald J. Trump said today he is ending his 15-year 
marriage to his former fashion model wife, Ivana, giving her a $20-million to 
$25-million share of his estimated $1.7-billion fortune and custody of their 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by Trump spokesman Dan Klores, the 43-year-old tycoon 
also indicated that his 40-year-old wife would no longer manage New York's 
Plaza Hotel, his most prestigious real estate holding. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Trump has always made all the business and financial decisions about the 
Plaza and I'm sure he'll continue to do so," Klores said. 
</P>
<P>
Klores said that Trump decided to end the marriage nearly a week ago, before 
leaving for Japan to attend the Mike Tyson-James (Buster) Douglas fight as one 
of Tyson's most prominent fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to leaving for Japan last Tuesday, Mr. Trump told his wife that, as 
painful as it was, the marriage was no longer working out," Klores said. "Mrs. 
Trump then decided not to go to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a prenuptial agreement whereby Mrs. Trump will receive a 
multimillion-dollar, 45-room mansion in Greenwich, Conn., and somewhere between 
$20 and $25 million. She also will retain custody of the three children." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's fortune was estimated last year by Forbes magazine in its Forbes Four 
Hundred at $1.7 billion, the nation's 19th largest. 
</P>
<P>
Trump denied in another statement, reported in the Daily News, rumors that his 
wife initiated divorce proceedings because of his womanizing. 
</P>
<P>
"As for those other women I have been linked with, I want to say that we are 
all 'just friends,' and that's as far as it goes," he was quoted as saying. "It 
is better for Ivana and me to separate at this time. But I am leaving because I 
want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Trump could not be reached for comment. She was reported to be staying at 
the luxury penthouse suite in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, which the Trumps 
used as their principal residence. With her were their two sons and a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, who transformed his father's $40-million Queensboro real estate kingdom 
into a Manhattan-based empire, met his Vienna-born wife in Montreal when she 
was a model and married her in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to Trump was quoted by the Daily News as saying the developer is 
not planning to negotiate a gilt-edged settlement with his wife on the grounds 
that she was not considered a vital part of his business empire.

Commentator Andy Rooney, under suspension from CBS for three months for 
allegedly making a racist remark, said Sunday that the subsequent publicity 
barrage made him feel like novelist Salman Rushdie, who was condemned to death 
for his writings. 
</P>
<P>
In a syndicated column, Rooney, the resident humorist at "60 Minutes," again 
insisted that he did not make the controversial comments attributed to him by a 
reporter for the Advocate, a newspaper for homosexuals based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I not only deny the quote attributed to me, I say the quotation was made up by 
a young reporter who couldn't take notes," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The article in the Advocate quotes the commentator as saying, "Most people are 
born with intelligence, but blacks have watered down their genes because the 
less-intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children. They drop out 
of school early, do drugs and get pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Rooney was suspended for three months on Thursday by CBS News President David 
Burke. His future with the network after that time remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
In the column, Rooney said the remarks attributed to him came from an "angry 
gay organization" that had conducted an organized campaign against him after he 
made comments during a "60 Minutes" commentary that they called homophobic. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said he was subjected to intense public scrutiny after the quotes in the 
Advocate were first reported, describing the barrage of phone calls he received 
at his office from news organizations seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside the front door, as we answered calls upstairs, camera crews were lined 
up on the sidewalk waiting for me to poke out my head out the door so they 
could pounce on me," he said. "I felt like Salman Rushdie." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie was sentenced to death last year by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini after the Iranian leader labeled his novel, "The Satanic Verses," 
blasphemous to Muslims. Rushdie remains in hiding in England. 
</P>
<P>
After the suspension became public Friday, the network's Manhattan switchboards 
were deluged by thousands of mostly angry callers who implored the network to 
reinstate Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that virtually all callers were pro-Rooney. CBS declined to 
comment on the reaction.

Former Sen. J. William Fulbright is getting married. 
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old Democrat who represented Arkansas in Congress for 32 years will 
marry Harriett Mayor on March 10 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor, 56, is executive director of the Fulbright Assn.. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been really good friends for a long time and it's only been recently 
that he asked me to marry him," Mayor said in a telephone interview from 
Washington. "We talk about world affairs. That's what got us together, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
Fulbright, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 15 years, 
said he called Mayor early one morning several weeks ago to propose. He said he 
figured it would take the better part of the day to persuade her and was 
surprised when she said yes right away. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid she wouldn't accept because I'm old and she's young, you know," 
Fulbright said in a telephone interview from Captiva, Fla., where he was 
visiting one of his two daughters.

Steffi Graf will not need surgery to repair her broken thumb, the world's 
top-ranked woman tennis player learned today when she was also told that she 
will not be able to resume swinging a racket for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, after speaking with doctors, said she is certain she will be ready to 
play in the French Open starting May 28 and continue her quest for a second 
Grand Slam.

Graf splintered a bone in her right thumb when she fell last week while on 
skis, apparently trying to evade photographers at the Swiss resort of St.

James (Buster) Douglas returned home to a hero's welcome today, greeted by more 
than 1,000 new fans who wanted to catch a glimpse of the man who surprised the 
world by knocking out heavyweight champion Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
When Douglas headed for Tokyo to fight Tyson, he left in obscurity. Hardly 
anyone noticed or cared. But he was met by a cheering crowd upon his arrival 
this afternoon at Port Columbus International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
His grandmother, Sarah Jones, stepped to the microphone, held the World Boxing 
Council belt high in the air and said: "We did it, Columbus. We got it. And now 
we're going to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said he wants to take on undefeated Evander Holyfield, who had already 
signed a contract to fight Tyson in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Evander Holyfield's the No. 1 contender, and he would be the next opponent," 
he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he discussed with Mayor Dana Rinehart the possibility of having 
the fight at Ohio Stadium, home of the Ohio State football team in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was greeted by about 500 pupils of the Windsor Alternative School, 
where his son, Lamar, is a fifth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just like to thank everyone for coming out and showing their support. All 
the little people, all the kids," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 29, shocked the sport of boxing Sunday with his 10th-round knockout of 
Tyson, who went down to his first defeat in 38 fights. 
</P>
<P>
But two of boxing's three governing bodies suspended Douglas' victory, pending 
review of film to determine if Douglas received a long count when Tyson knocked 
him down in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
Rinehart said as far as he and Columbus are concerned, Douglas is the city's 
newest champion. 
</P>
<P>
"If they take this championship away from him, Rocky Marciano will flip over in 
his grave," Rinehart said. 
</P>
<P>
A parade was scheduled for Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The International Boxing Federation said it recognized Douglas as the champion, 
but the World Boxing Council and the World Boxing Assn. suspended the result 
pending their investigation. They could order a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson stood to make at least $25 million by fighting Holyfield, and Holyfield 
at least $12 million. Douglas got $1.3 million for Sunday's fight. 
</P>
<P>
Even in Columbus, Douglas' knockout of Tyson came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
At the Scoreboard Lounge, a local sports bar, most of the patrons watched the 
preliminaries to Sunday's NBA All-Star Game instead of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it all happen, but there were just a few of us watching," said bartender 
Scott Dye. "The vast majority were paying attention to the slam-dunk 
competition at the NBA All-Star Game on the big screens. 
</P>
<P>
"What an upset, the biggest upset in boxing history. It's not too often you get 
a heavyweight champion from Columbus, Ohio, but you've got one now." 
</P>
<P>
But Doug Owens of the Fitness Center in suburban Westerville, where Douglas 
trains, said he was not surprised. Owens supervises Douglas' diet and weight 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw it as a wonderful fight," Owens said. "It shows that James is the great 
fighter that he is."

Mike Tyson returned from Japan today, pledging to come back from his disputed 
heavyweight title loss to James (Buster) Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lost before," Tyson said as he was hustled through John F. Kennedy 
Airport. "It's no big deal. I've always come back from a loss." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he hopes to get back in the ring soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," he said. "I have a slight swelling in my eye and, as soon as it 
goes down, I'm ready to go back to training. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a pretty bad performance, but I'm not going to make excuses. I'm just 
going to go on and make better results." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who met Tyson's Japan Air flight was Lou Duva, manager of Evander 
Holyfield, who was scheduled to fight Tyson for the heavyweight championship in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"When Tyson walked into the ring, I could see something was wrong," Duva said. 
"He had no life. He didn't have that drive. He's not the fighter he was with 
Kevin Rooney." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson dismissed Rooney as his trainer a year ago. The Douglas bout on Sunday 
was his third title defense without Rooney in his corner. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson was accompanied by promoter Don King, who lodged a protest with the World 
Boxing Council and World Boxing Assn. claiming Douglas had benefited from a 
long count after Tyson knocked the challenger down near the end of the eighth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
King refused any comment. 
</P>
<P>
Duva said the long count dispute was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The ref is the boss in the ring at all times," Duva said. "I think it would be 
a black eye for boxing if they take the title away from Douglas, but I know the 
way they operate, they might order a rematch. But as far as I'm concerned, Mike 
Tyson got knocked out." 
</P>
<P>
Tyson said of the long count controversy: "The referee said he made a bad 
mistake. Regardless of that, I'd be happy to get a rematch. I'll be better 
prepared next time." 
</P>
<P>
Airport crowds who recognized Tyson shouted encouragement, and Tyson responded 
with a thumbs up sign as he climbed into a waiting limousine.

ADVERTISING MAY BE IN THE CARDS FOR COLLECTORS, TRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORM COHEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You see it on television, along the highways, in the newspapers, at the movies 
and even at sporting events. You don't even have to look closely to find 
advertising with your trading cards, either. 
</P>
<P>
Card manufacturers have traditionally used wrappers and insert cards to push 
other products made by their parent companies, and collectors never seemed to 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you opened a pack of store-bought cards and found an insert 
promoting Pepsi or Coke? Although the card company people say they don't 
foresee it, baseball cards may someday include a word from your sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Packs of cards that used to go for a nickel in the '60s now sell for anywhere 
from 50 cents to a dollar. Accepting advertising could help the card companies 
stabilize prices in the same way that commercials have helped bring down home 
video costs. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Score knows it or not, it has already laid the foundation for bringing 
Madison Avenue to cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
Although no corporate logos appear, Score's 1989 football and 1990 baseball 
sets contain studio photos of Brian Bosworth and Bo Jackson that are readily 
associated with major athletic shoe ad campaigns. They have left collectors 
wondering whether the cards represent an advertising deal on the sly. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not at all," Score spokesman George Martin said. "In fact, we had a lot of 
trouble getting permission to use the Bo picture." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the photographer who owns the rights to the picture of a shirtless 
Jackson stretching a bat over his shoulder pads was steadfastly against 
allowing it to be used on a baseball card. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an artist," Los Angeles fashion photographer Richard Noble said to Martin. 
"Baseball cards are certainly not art." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said he softened Noble up by showing him some artsy Scoremaster cards. 
But it finally took letters from Nike and Jackson's agent, and a good word from 
a vice president of the Ford Modeling Agency, to turn him around. 
</P>
<P>
The result is No. 697 in the '90 baseball set. 
</P>
<P>
The Bosworth card is another story. The art from an Avia ad showing a shoe and 
the back of Boz's famous head appears on the reverse of No. 239 in Score's 
debut football set. 
</P>
<P>
Because Bosworth is not a member of the National Football League Players Assn., 
Score had to negotiate with him directly. "Brian Bosworth's agent made using 
that picture a condition of including him in our set," Martin said. "But we 
think it's great." 
</P>
<P>
Collectors with a sense of humor seem to like it, but many others say: "Big 
deal. I've seen the ad." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the meat of the matter. Avia logo or not, people are aware of what 
the picture represents. Whether the company paid Score or not, the card buyer 
has received Avia's advertising message. 
</P>
<P>
Although Score is using advertising art without accepting advertising fees, 
these two cards might be pointing the industry toward its destiny. If 
corporations are already sponsoring bowl games and card shows, can the cards 
themselves be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
Ball-card advertising would certainly pay off handsomely for the sponsors. 
Imagine how children would react if they saw Michael Jordan eating his Wheaties 
or Joe Montana sipping Diet Pepsi every time they opened a pack of cards. 
</P>
<P>
Taking it one step further, maybe every card will have its own sponsor some 
day, and the reverse of a card featuring some iron-gloved, slow-footed, .198 
hitter will read, "This Space for Rent."

JACKIE ROBINSON: SIMPLY A GREAT ATHLETE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: HE MAY BE BEST KNOWN FOR BREAKING THE COLOR LINE, BUT HE IS ALSO 
REMEMBERED FOR HIS TREMENDOUS ABILITIES IN MANY SPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In today's sports world, fans thrill to Eric Dickerson cutting-back off-tackle 
and Jerry Rice making fingertip catch behind a startled secondary. 
</P>
<P>
They applaud Ozzie Smith as he darts into the hole for a backhand stop and 
Kevin Mitchell when he clouts the ball into the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
And they marvel as Magic Johnson drives by a muscling Moses Malone. The black 
athlete is an obvious force. It was not always so. At one time the black man 
was welcome only in track and boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Then a husky, superlative athlete signed a Montreal baseball contract in 1945. 
Jack Roosevelt Robinson turned it around in an adventure that aroused the 
spirit of his race and opened the eyes of whites throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The country came out of World War II looking for escape from the four-year 
torment of global war. The black was looking for a chance to better his lot. 
And Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was looking for a 
pennant. Rickey had scouts beating the bushes in Puerto Rico, Central America 
and throughout the Negro leagues. No black had played in the major leagues 
since 1888. They were an untapped source of talent. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger scouts thought the great Satchel Paige and power-hitting Josh Gibson 
were too old. Roy Campanella and Monte Irvin lacked the maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The scouts agreed Robinson, a four-sport letterman at UCLA before the war, was 
the man to face the unbelievable pressure of breaking the color barrier. Scout 
Wid Matthews watched Robinson play with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Robinson can protect the strike zone better than any other young 
ballplayer I've ever seen," Matthews reported. 
</P>
<P>
That helped to sell Rickey, who met with Robinson in Brooklyn on Aug. 28, 1945. 
It was a rough one-on-one conversation. 
</P>
<P>
The executive explained he planned to break the color line and wanted Jackie to 
be his man. 
</P>
<P>
"But do you have the courage?" Rickey asked. "When the opposition calls you 
'black son-of-a-bitch' and 'black bastard'; when they try to spike you; when 
they throw at you, do you have guts enough not to fight back?" 
</P>
<P>
Jackie listened, stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you this," Rickey continued. "What would you do if a ballplayer 
made sexual remarks about you and your mother?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'd kill him!" Robinson exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"No, No!" Rickey bellowed. He emphasized the only way to succeed was by Jackie 
"turning the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
"A fight is what the bigots would want," Rickey said. "They'd claim whites and 
blacks couldn't play on the same field without the threat of a riot and it 
would be years before we could try again." 
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed on the path of non-violence and Jackie signed with the 
Dodger farm club at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
For the fiery, competitive Robinson, it would be his toughest battle. But for 
Jackie, it was never easy. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Cairo, Ga., on Jan. 31, 1919, the youngest of five children. His 
father deserted the family when Jackie was 6 months old. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1920, his mother headed to California with her brood. There 
she would support the family on the $8 a week she earned as a maid. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinsons lived on Pepper Street in Pasadena, where Jackie became am 
athletic legend. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was Jackie's older brother, Mack, who was the family's first 
sports star. Mack finished second to Jesse Owens in the 200- meter dash at the 
1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie was a heralded all-around athlete at Muir High school in Pasadena, 
winning letters in football, basketball, baseball and track. 
</P>
<P>
He was the catcher on Muir's baseball team in 1937. Jackie joined outfielder 
Ted Williams of San Diego Hoover and third baseman Bob Lemon of Long Beach 
Wilson on the Pomona tournament all-star squad. 
</P>
<P>
At Pasadena Junior College he led his football team to 11 consecutive victories 
in 1938. Jackie scored two touchdowns and passed for another in a thrilling win 
over Compton College at the Rose Bowl. Edwin (Duke) Snider was among the 40,000 
fans in attendance that day. 
</P>
<P>
The Duke, later to be Jackie's teammate with the Dodgers, recalled with a 
chuckle of admiration Robinson's exploits at Pasadena JC. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie was great in football, basketball and baseball," said Snider. "He could 
have been a pro in all three sports. 
</P>
<P>
"On a punt return against Compton, he reversed his field three times. Everybody 
on the field took a shot at him, but nobody could touch him. He was something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
On May 8, 1938, Robinson performed two feats usually reserved for pulp fiction. 
</P>
<P>
At a track meet in Claremont he won the long jump with a leap of 25-6 1/2 to 
break his brother Mack's national junior college record. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie then hustled to a waiting car, which headed for a Glendale baseball 
diamond. He arrived in the third inning, entered the lineup at shortstop, and 
paced his Pasadena Junior College team to a 5-3 victory for the Southern 
California junior college baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the long jump at Pasadena City College, Robinson ran a 9.7 100, a 21.5 
220, a 48.5 440; he pole-vaulted 13 feet, had a 23.7 mark for the 220 low 
hurdles and ran on the 440 relay team. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged more than 25 points a game in basketball during his two years at 
Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
The first time he attempted golf, 1,000 people watched Robinson break 90 at 
Pasadena's Brookside Park. 
</P>
<P>
In tennis, badminton and Ping-Pong, Jackie competed aggressively against 
Pasadena's Dave Freeman, who became the world's badminton champion. 
</P>
<P>
And Robinson was a quick and talented boxer. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie was awarded a partial scholarship to UCLA when he decided to attend 
college near his family. 
</P>
<P>
He remains UCLA's only four-sport letterman with monograms in football, 
basketball, baseball and track. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was college football's leading ground gainer in 1939, averaging 11.4 
yards-a-carry and returning punts for a 16.4-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
Teamed with Kenny Washington, he drove the Bruins to within two yards of 
victory over USC and a trip to the Rose Bowl. The 1939 USC-UCLA game ended in a 
0-0 tie, however, and the Trojans received the bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
The late Cotton Warburton, one of USC's famed backs of yesteryear, called 
Robinson the most exciting back he ever saw. And he watched most of the Trojan 
greats, including Frank Gifford, Jon Arnett, Mike Garrett and O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie was quick and fast," Warburton said. "Coach Jones (USC Coach Howard 
Jones) would put his best defensive man on Robinson telling the defender to 
tackle him whether he had the ball or not." 
</P>
<P>
On the basketball court, Jackie led the southern division of the Pacific Coast 
Conference in scoring for two years. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the winning basket in an upset of Cal, and scored 23 points against 
highly ranked Stanford during the 1940 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In 1941, Jackie closed out his college career with 20 points against USC, but 
the Bruins dropped a 57-52 decision. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson won the 1940 NCAA long jump with a leap of 24 feet 10 1/4 inches 
indoors at the University of Minnesota field house. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, baseball was his weakest sport. He batted under .200 as a Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtely the highlight of Jackie's college life was meeting Rachel Isum, the 
woman who would become his wife. She was an honor student majoring in nursing 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A refined, pretty woman, Rachel had no interest in sports . . . until she dated 
Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
Years later he remarked, "Rachel was the most important, helpful and 
encouraging person I met in my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
They were married shortly after Jackie signed with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
When his college athletic eligibility ended, Jackie left school and took a job 
with the National Youth Administration to help support his mother. He also 
played professional football with the Los Angeles Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
With the outbreak of World War II, Robinson entered officer candidate school at 
Ft. Riley, Kansas. Actually, OCS was closed to blacks at Ft. Riley. But through 
the intervention of Joe Louis, Jackie was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
In the service his biggest battle was against bigotry. After Robinson was 
commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant, he became morale officer of a Negro truck 
battalion. 
</P>
<P>
In that capacity he phoned the provost marshall, Major Hafner, and stated a 
half-dozen seats in the PX were not enough for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The major told him things would remain as they were. 
</P>
<P>
Hafner than reportedly asked Jackie over the phone, "Lt. Robinson, how would 
you like your wife sitting next to a (black)?" Except Hafner didn't say 
"black." He used a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie exploded. The battalion commander supported Robinson. Hafner was 
reprimanded, Jackie commended and the PX seating arrangement changed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson quit the Ft. Riley football team when he was suddenly granted a 
two-week leave before a game with the University of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri had notified military authorities it would not compete against a squad 
with a black athlete. Robinson wanted no part of a team that would bow to 
racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
At Camp Hood, Tex., Jackie refused to move to the back of a bus. The custom was 
in direct violation of a federal ruling against segregated buses on army posts. 
</P>
<P>
The incident led to court-martial proceedings against Jackie with charges that 
he was insolent and impertinent to a military police officer. Robinson was 
acquitted, but it was a needless and humiliating incident. 
</P>
<P>
After his discharge, Jackie became basketball coach at Samuel Houston College 
in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He missed competing himself, however, and signed on as shortstop with the 
Kansas City Monarchs for $400 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson batted .345 for Kansas City in 1945. It was here he was so carefully 
scouted by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
When he donned a Montreal uniform in 1946, Jackie captivated the sports world. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game he became an instant star. Jackie led the Royals to a 14-1 
victory over Jersey City. He played second base and batted second in the Royal 
order. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson banged out four hits in five trips to the plate with three singles and 
a home run. 
</P>
<P>
He stole second twice and scored four runs -- two of which came when the 
pitcher balked after becoming unnerved by Robinson's dashes down the third base 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Joe Bostic summed up the event by writing in the New York Amsterdam 
News: "The most significant sports story of the century was written into the 
record books today as baseball took up the cudgel for democracy and an 
unassuming but superlative Negro boy ascended to heights of excellence to prove 
the rightness of the experiment. And prove it in the only correct crucible for 
such an experiment -- the crucible of white-hot competition." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Al Campanis was Jackie's double-play partner at Montreal. Campanis, 
who three years ago was forced to resign as Dodger vice president/general 
manager as a result of his remarks about blacks, recalled vividly Robinson's 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie had great athletic aptitude," said Campanis. "I was playing shortstop, 
but I had experience at second base and knew the position. 
</P>
<P>
"The baserunners were going for Jackie as he came across the bag on a double 
play. I worked with him on the rocker step. That's where you hit the bag with 
the left foot, step back on the right and throw to first. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie picked it up in a half-hour. We had another second baseman who needed 
weeks to learn the move. 
</P>
<P>
"Robinson was a big man," Campanis continued. "He weighed 195 at Montreal and 
well over 200 with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"But he was amazingly fast and agile. If he were caught in a rundown, the odds 
were in Jackie's favor to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson took an incredible amount of verbal abuse during the year with 
Montreal, and there was always the beanball. 
</P>
<P>
"You never saw anything like it," said Dixie Howell, the catcher who was 
Robinson's teammate at Montreal and later in Brooklyn. "Every time he came up, 
he'd go down!" 
</P>
<P>
The pressure mounted and Jackie was close to a nervous breakdown during the 
season. But as always, he sucked it up. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to hit .349 and win the International League batting title and most 
valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie then paced Montreal to the Little World Series flag as the Royals downed 
Louisville, four games to two. 
</P>
<P>
Courage is like love -- it must have hope for nourishment -- Napoleon Bonaparte 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was promoted to Brooklyn for the 1947 season. With Eddie Stanky at 
second base for the Dodgers, Jackie opened National League play at first. 
</P>
<P>
Now he faced major league pitching as well as big league bigots. 
</P>
<P>
They called him every slur in the book. 
</P>
<P>
They yelled remarks about his odor. There were hyphenated expressions about his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Fans threw watermelon rinds in his path. Pitchers threw at his head, knees and 
groin. 
</P>
<P>
Baserunners came in with spikes flashing. Infielders tagged him viciously. 
</P>
<P>
It was a 200,000-1 shot for a young man to make it to the major leagues and 
succeed. Jackie Robinson became a star with hatred ringing in his ears. 
</P>
<P>
Young blacks of a later era criticized him for not fighting back. He couldn't. 
His hands were tied. "No fights . . . no brawls" was the agreement with Rickey. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, when the pitcher flipped him, Jackie had to get up out of the dirt 
and face the fast ball again, always the tight fast ball. 
</P>
<P>
That first year some of his Dodger teammates asked to be traded. Popular Fred 
(Dixie) Walker was swapped after the 1947 season. 
</P>
<P>
Walker and Hal Gregg went to Pittsburgh for left-handed pitcher Preacher Roe 
and third baseman Billy Cox. It was a great trade for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Louis Cardinals threatened to strike if Robinson played. They backed 
down when league president Ford Frick warned he would suspend any 
trouble-makers. 
</P>
<P>
There was a particularly ugly incident of bench-jockeying in a series with 
Philadelphia. Alabama-born manager Ben Chapman and his Phillies were all over 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Stanky couldn't take it and shouted at the Phillies' bench, "You're all a bunch 
of cowards, picking on a man who can't fight back!" 
</P>
<P>
It might have been the turning point in the season as the Dodgers rallied 
around Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
During that first year -- 1947 -- Robinson won the rookie of the year award, as 
the Dodgers took the National League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .297 with 12 homers in 151 games. Robinson garnered his first of two 
stolen base titles with 29 thefts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1948 Jackie replaced Stanky at second base and batted .296. Robinson's top 
year was 1949, when he won the National League's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
He batted .342 with 203 hits, 38 doubles, 12 triples, 16 homers, 124 runs 
batted in, and 122 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie's .342 average and 37 stolen bases were league highs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of six straight seasons in which he batted over .300. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn club of the late '40s and early '50s was loaded with talent. 
</P>
<P>
Catcher Roy Campanella, who possessed "bleacher power" and outstanding 
defensive skills, was named National League most valuable player in '51, '53 
and '55. 
</P>
<P>
Gil Hodges, a fine fielding first baseman, hit the long ball, particularly in 
Brooklyn's Ebbets Field. From 1949 to 1955 he recorded 100 or more RBIs a 
season and averaged more than 32 home runs a year. 
</P>
<P>
Talented Junior Gilliam broke into the lineup at second base in 1953. 
Thereafter, Robinson split his time between third base and the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Shortstop Pee Wee Reese became one of Jackie's closest friends on the club. 
Reese, who picked up his nickname for his childhood skill in marbles, ranked 
with contemporaries Marty Marion, Lou Boudreau and Phil Rizzuto as a shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Cox, with the hands of a pickpocket, could be compared with Brooks 
Robinson as a defensive third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Amoros, Gene Hermanski, Andy Pafko and George (Shotgun) Shuba divided 
time in left field. 
</P>
<P>
Center belonged to Hall of Famer Duke Snider, a highly talented fielder who hit 
.259 lifetime and 407 career home runs. 
</P>
<P>
The late Carl Furillo was an outstanding right fielder. Furillo led the 
National League in batting in 1953 with a .344 average. His rifle arm was the 
most accurate in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
On the mound were fireballing Don Newcombe, Ralph Branca, Preacher Roe and Carl 
Erskine, whose overhand curve was the best since Tommy Bridges'. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen boasted hard-throwing relievers Clem Labine and Joe Black. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson was the catalyst. His alert mind, level swing, sure hands and 
agility and daring on the basepaths helped propel the Dodgers to six National 
League pennants from 1947-1956. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1949 campaign, Rickey and Robinson had another meeting. The 
executive said it was time to no longer "turn the other cheek." 
</P>
<P>
There were other blacks in the majors now -- Larry Doby at Cleveland and Roy 
Campanella with the Dodgers. Don Newcombe and the Giants' Monte Irvin were 
coming up in '49. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd been quiet long enough," Rickey said. "Jackie had to show his courage to 
men who only know courage in a physical sense." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson joined Ty Cobb and Pepper Martin as the most exciting and competitive 
players to perform between the white lines. 
</P>
<P>
On the basepaths there might never have been anyone so unnerving. As a runner 
he had a quick start -- a carry-over from his days as a track star. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie had dancing moves off the bag. By the third step he was in full stride. 
He had the ability to look back over his shoulder without losing speed. 
</P>
<P>
What was really a show was when Jackie reached third base. He stole home 19 
times, and once in World Series play (Sept. 28, 1955 against the Yankees). 
</P>
<P>
On third, he'd be a constant threat to the pitcher. He'd dash halfway home 
during the windup and still hustle back to third to beat a throw from the 
catcher. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson even amazed his teammates with his daring. Once he scored all the way 
from first base on a sacrifice fly by Gene Hermanski. And he was a master of 
the slide. 
</P>
<P>
At bat Jackie overcame "football shoulders," once pointed out by Bob Feller, 
who claimed Robinson couldn't get around on the fast ball. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie held the bat uncommonly high with wrists not far from his right ear. 
Hall of Famer George Sisler taught him to hit to right field during the '49 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
During his later years with the Dodgers he batted clean-up. He had average 
power, but he was a true clutch hitter with fine bat control on the bunt. The 
threat was always there that he would put the ball down. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949 the Dodgers were back in the World Series. Once again they were beaten 
by the Yankees as they would be in five of the six World Series in which Jackie 
competed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson played only one game -- in 1953 -- at shortstop in his major league 
career. His arm wasn't strong enough for the position. 
</P>
<P>
He played 197 games at first, 751 at second, 256 at third and 152 in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing that impressed everyone was Jackie's constant hustle. And nothing 
pointed that up more than the Dodger nightmare year of 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn blew a 13 1/2-game lead and lost the flag to the Giants in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
Few remember, though, that the Dodgers were fortunate to get in that playoff. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers and Giants were tied on the last day of the campaign and the 
Dodgers were at Shibe Park in Philadelphia for a game with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard showed the Giants beat Boston, 3-2, to move one-half game ahead. 
The Dodgers needed a win to make a playoff necessary. And it was Robinson who 
almost single-handedly got it for them. 
</P>
<P>
He made a diving catch over second base of a liner off Eddie Waitkus' bat to 
get Don Newcombe out of trouble in the 12th inning of an 8-8 tie. In the 
process, Jackie's elbows were jammed into his body and he lost consciousness 
for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie refused to leave the game and with two out in the 14th inning, he 
clouted a home run off Robin Roberts to earn Brooklyn a 9-8 decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants and Dodgers split the first two games of the playoff. Bobby 
Thomson's dramatic 315-foot, three-run homer off Ralph Branca in the last of 
the ninth of the third game gave the Giants an unbelievable pennant. 
</P>
<P>
The Giant fans in the Polo Grounds went wild. The Dodgers walked slowly off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Only Jackie remained. With hands on hips he watched to see that Thomson touched 
every base. Then Robinson turned and in his familiar pigeon-toed gait moved 
toward the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
In 1955 Jackie was reduced to 105 games and he batted .256, but this was the 
year the Dodgers finally beat the Yankees in seven games for the World 
Championship. Johnny Podres spaced eight hits and the Dodgers topped the 
Yankees, 2-0, in the decider. 
</P>
<P>
By 1956 Jackie was clearly slowing down. He batted .275 with 10 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was traded to the hated Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 on 
Dec. 13, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
But Jackie wanted to spend more time with his wife and three children and he 
announced his retirement on Jan. 5, 1957. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of baseball his interests varied. Jackie worked for a restaurant chain 
in New York and was a major spokesman in the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
He became involved in politics and assisted New York Governor Nelson 
Rockefeller. He also did frequent radio and television work including 
baseball's Game of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, his first year of eligibility, Jackie was elected to the Baseball Hall 
of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was beset with personal problems. Jackie Jr. picked up a drug habit in 
Vietnam. When he had the addiction beaten, the young Robinson was killed in an 
auto accident. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie himself suffered from diabetes and he had a heart attack in 1968. By 
this time the once great athlete walked with a cane and his sight was failing. 
</P>
<P>
At the opening same of the 1972 World Series Jackie made a rare appearance when 
he was honored by the sport on which he left an indelible mark. 
</P>
<P>
Only weeks later, on Oct. 24, 1972, he died at age 53. The diabetes and the 
inner conflict of his first three years in baseball took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime he touched many people in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
That first year in the majors -- 1947 -- he was voted runner-up to Bing Crosby 
as the most popular man in America in a poll. He had more than 5,000 social and 
commercial requests for personal appearances that year. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist John Crosby called him "the blackest black man, as well as one of the 
handsomest, I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
President Dwight Eisenhower crossed a crowded ballroom to shake Jackie's hand 
at a black-tie affair. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball people saw him as a multi-talented competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"He was tough, intelligent and proud," Dodger scout Clyde Sukeforth said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner, who is now a broadcaster for the New York Mets, 
emphasized, "Robinson was the only player I ever saw who could completely turn 
a game around by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"His ability to run the bases, to intimidate the pitchers, to take the extra 
base, to hang in there under the worst kind of pressure made him antagonize the 
opposition to the benefit of his own team." 
</P>
<P>
Campanella said, "I never saw a ballplayer who could do all the things Jackie 
could. He could think so much faster than anybody I ever played with or 
against. He was two steps and one thought ahead of anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Although Willie Mays of the Giants and Robinson were fierce rivals, they were 
friends off the field. Mays recalled an incident in Ebbets Field when he 
crashed into the wall after catching a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie came running out," Mays said. "He turned me over to see if the ball 
dropped out of my glove." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Duke Snider's story about Sam (Toothpick) Jones, a fine black 
pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie was yelling at Jones from the on-deck circle," Snider said. "Jackie 
kept yelling, "Sam, you've got no guts . . . I'm going to beat you."' 
</P>
<P>
"By the time Jackie stepped in, Sam was boiling. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones hit Jackie with a pitch, then threw the ball into right field when he 
tried to pick Robinson off first. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Jackie's on third taunting Sam and dancing around. Jones was paying more 
attention to Jackie than the batter and he bounced a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie scored on the wild pitch to give us a 3-2 win. Sam nearly swallowed his 
toothpick." 
</P>
<P>
And there were always the confrontations between Giant Manager Leo Durocher and 
Jackie. They were so much alike -- great competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey once maintained Durocher had the uncommon ability to make a bad 
situation infinitely worse. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the bad feeling between Robinson and Durocher stemmed from a play at 
first base when Jackie barrelled over Giant second baseman Davey Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Williams suffered a spinal injury which nearly ended his career. The Giants 
thought it was a cheap shot. Jackie maintained it was part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Durocher, always a dandy but all man, was married to actress Laraine Day. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie would yell from the dugout in his unmistakably high voice, "Leo, lay off 
of Laraine's perfume." 
</P>
<P>
Durocher would retaliate by holding his hands a couple inches from his head, 
alongside his ears, indicating Jackie had a swelled head. 
</P>
<P>
Late in his career Jackie had ballooned up to 230 pounds. Leo was always 
yelling remarks about his size. 
</P>
<P>
They almost went at it a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
Years later Durocher said of Jackie, "He beat me a thousand times in a thousand 
ways -- getting a base hit, making a play, making the double play, hitting the 
home run, stealing a base, stealing home, upsetting my pitcher with his antics 
on the bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy didn't just come to play. He came to beat you." 
</P>
<P>
He did more than that. His accomplishments transcend baseball -- he showed the 
way for his race.
