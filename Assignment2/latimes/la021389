Psychologist Leon Festinger, who during a 47-year career as a teacher and 
writer developed the theory of cognitive dissonance to help explain seemingly 
irrational human behavior, died Saturday of liver cancer. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
Festinger, a New York City native, was professor of psychology at the New 
School for Social Research from 1968 until his death. He died at his New York 
home, the New School said. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly was one of the most influential psychologists of our time," said 
Robert Johnson, professor of social psychology at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Festinger wrote dozens of articles and books on psychology, including several 
on the theory of cognitive dissonance, which occurs when two simultaneously 
held thoughts, opinions or beliefs are inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
A City College of New York graduate, Festinger went on to get his master's and 
doctorate from Iowa State University. He later taught at the University of 
Iowa, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan and 
the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the New School, he was professor of psychology at Stanford 
University from 1955-68. 
</P>
<P>
Festinger is survived by his wife, Trudy, two sons, a daughter, a stepdaughter 
and three grandchildren.

TAXATION OR MISREPRESENTATION?; 
</P>
<P>
POST-PROP. 13 CASH SCARCITIES REPLACE THE BIG BITE WITH MANY LITTLE ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest 
possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jean Baptiste Colbert, 
</P>
<P>
Louis XIV's minister of finance 
</P>
<P>
Most San Diego public officials probably have never heard of the Sun King's 
finance minister. However, from the perspective of some skeptics -- alarmed by 
what they see as a disturbing trend in local taxation -- those same 
officeholders have become skilled practitioners of Colbert's 325-year-old 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
"Get the most money from the public with the least squawking -- that's the iron 
law of politics," former San Diego City Councilman Fred Schnaubelt said. "And 
politicians have become very clever about it. They take a little here, a little 
there, always in such small amounts that there's no public outrage. But, over 
time, it adds up." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, local governments have turned with increasing frequency 
to special sales taxes, so-called assessment districts or service areas, user 
fees and other similar devices to expand their budgets in the post-Proposition 
13 era. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years alone in San Diego County, half-cent sales taxes for 
transit and jails were approved, and the city and county enacted temporary 
waivers of the so-called Gann spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Taxes Under Consideration 
</P>
<P>
The city is now reviewing a plan calling for a special $50-million-plus annual 
tax to hire more police, with a property-tax increase, a utility user's tax and 
the sale of general obligation bonds being the major fund-raising options under 
consideration. The county, meanwhile, is pondering a special property-tax 
assessment to pay for libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Elected officials argue that the special taxes -- each of which, they 
emphasize, was approved by the voters -- are needed to handle growing 
responsibilities at a time when measures such as Proposition 13, the landmark 
1978 tax-cutting initiative, and the Gann limit tie their hands fiscally. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, see the special taxes as a way of nickel-and-diming the 
public, and ask: What happened to the days when you paid your taxes once and 
government made do? 
</P>
<P>
"There's ample justification for feeling that, as soon as the hand of 
government is withdrawn from one of your pockets, it slips into another one 
going after more money," said former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock, now a 
radio talk-show host. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Government's Insatiable Appetite' 
</P>
<P>
Dot Migdal, who monitors City Hall and the County Administration Center for the 
San Diego Chamber of Commerce, attributes the myriad special taxes to 
"government's insatiable appetite." 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it satisfies that appetite in one big bite or a bunch of little ones, 
the result is the same," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing those attitudes as overly cynical, city and county officials contend 
that such characterizations of the special taxes also overlook compelling 
political realities -- starting with the way in which Proposition 13 shifted 
budget flexibility from San Diego to Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"What a lot of people still don't understand, 11 years later, is that 
Proposition 13 left (local governments) with the responsibility to provide 
services at the same time that it took away their ability to raise revenue," 
said David Janssen, the county's assistant chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Before Proposition 13, local governments could meet budget demands by simply 
nudging up property taxes, with fractional increases capable of generating tens 
of millions of dollars in new revenue. By capping property taxes at 1% of 
assessed value, however, Proposition 13 eliminated that option and left local 
governments heavily dependent upon the share of property-tax funds that they 
received from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, local officials argue, they have little alternative but to 
turn to special taxes to address pressing problems that create financial 
demands that outpace inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the requirement for voters' approval of all new taxes precludes -- in 
the officials' eyes -- criticism of the measures as a kind of sinister 
government plot to sneak small taxes by an unknowing public. Far from being 
violations of the spirit of Proposition 13, as opponents charge, supporters 
argue that the special tax proposals simply give voters opportunities to 
continuously chart government spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gives Voters a Chance' 
</P>
<P>
"What anyone who criticizes these (taxes) as a way of putting something over on 
the public is really saying is that the voters are stupid, and I don't believe 
that," Supervisor Susan Golding said. "No one's forcing the voters to approve 
this. It simply gives voters a chance to say, this is something we want to 
spend more money on, or, no, we don't. What's wrong with giving voters that 
choice?" 
</P>
<P>
While administrators complain that earmarking the taxes for specific purposes 
curtails their ability to shift funds from one area to another to meet 
unanticipated needs, they concede that asking the public to spend money on a 
particular program perhaps is more politically palatable than simply seeking a 
general tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, this allows voters to set the priorities," San Diego City Manager 
John Lockwood said. "From a management standpoint, that poses some problems 
because it reduces flexibility. But, politically, it's understandable why 
people might be more willing to spend more money on something they consider 
important than to just give more money to government with no strings attached." 
</P>
<P>
Another option that has been considered -- without much success -- involves the 
possibility of local governments generating revenue in order to reduce the need 
for tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for example, the City Council rejected a proposal to build a 
McDonald's fast-food restaurant in Balboa Park, a plan that would have 
generated six-figure annual payments to the city. In the mid-1980s, the Board 
of Supervisors turned down, on aesthetic and financial grounds, a proposed 
retail-hotel development on the bayfront parking lots flanking the county 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Even if such proposals prove feasible, officials say, they probably will never 
generate more than a small percentage of local governments' budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Where to Draw the Line 
</P>
<P>
"The question isn't so much whether you can do it -- it's where you draw the 
line on commercialization," San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner said. "If we 
really wanted, we probably could sell advertising on the walls of City Hall. 
But do people really want a Shearson Lehman Brothers Andy Williams Isuzu City 
Hall? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
Recent special taxes -- and proposals for future ones -- have dealt with many 
high-profile issues. Voters' approval of them, officials argue, demonstrates 
the public's willingness to pay more to solve major problems. 
</P>
<P>
The half-cent sales tax approved last November by voters, for example, is 
projected to generate about $1.6 billion over its 10-year life to build new 
jails -- where inmate populations are now more than double their official 
capacity -- and more courtrooms. An earlier half-cent sales tax approved in 
November, 1987, is expected to raise nearly $2.25 billion over 20 years for new 
highways, street improvements and transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
The various $50-million-a-year funding options being examined by the city to 
hire about 440 more police officers are envisioned as a means of meeting the 
San Diego City Council's longtime goal of having two sworn officers for every 
1,000 city residents. There are now 1.62 officers per 1,000 residents -- a rate 
that makes San Diego, the nation's seventh-largest city, ninth among the 
nation's top cities in terms of numbers of officers per capita. 
</P>
<P>
And, if the supervisors eventually propose a special tax to retire the library 
system's $1.6-million-a-year debt, that election will show whether San Diegans 
consider libraries important enough to justify the estimated $7-per-person 
charge needed to prevent cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The public identifies the issue and the public decides whether to spend more 
money on it," San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts said. "No one's ever 
excited about paying more taxes, but this way, at least the voters get heard 
very clearly." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Assumption 
</P>
<P>
Inherent in much of the debate over the special taxes is the assumption that 
local governments cannot meet those needs without more money, a matter that 
most officeholders regard as so common-sensical as to be indisputable. Although 
inflation, business expansion and population growth swell tax revenues 
annually, thereby enlarging municipal budgets, the price of needed services 
consistently grows even faster, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, are unwilling to accept that assumption on faith alone. With 
the county operating under a $1.3-billion annual budget and the city's budget 
topping $807 million, they argue that more efficient expenditure of those 
dollars would make it unnecessary to resort to more special taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to say government is inefficient and the money could be spent 
better, and, to a certain extent, that's true," Filner said. "But, unless you 
just start abandoning entire programs -- and I don't sense any public mandate 
for that -- at best, you might get an extra couple million dollars here or 
there by tightening up. That's nowhere near enough when you're talking about 
needing $50 million for something like police." 
</P>
<P>
Both city and county officials also complain that they get shortchanged from 
both Sacramento and Washington in the distribution of tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
County officials point out that San Diego ranks 57th out of the state's 58 
counties in per capita tax revenue that it receives from Sacramento. That 
inequity figures prominently in lawsuits that the county has filed against the 
state, seeking reimbursement for the tens of millions of dollars that it 
contends have been improperly denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Programs mandated by state or federal laws make up about 95% of the county's 
budget, transforming the county, in the words of Supervisor George Bailey, into 
"basically a funnel, a middle man." 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at how much money we have no discretion over, that $1-billion 
budget looks a lot smaller," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used for Basic Services 
</P>
<P>
Although opponents concede that many of those arguments have some merit, they 
object to the way special taxes have come to be used or proposed for basic 
services such as streets, jails and police protection. 
</P>
<P>
"These are services that, historically, people have become accustomed to 
receiving without getting hit with a special tax bill," said Mark Nelson, 
executive director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn. "It's fair to ask, if local 
government isn't doing that, what is it doing?" 
</P>
<P>
The growing number of special taxes and assessment districts also draws 
critics' ire. Over the past five years, for example, the number of assessment 
districts -- areas where residents agree to pay higher taxes in return for 
special services -- has tripled to 24, according to William McGuigan, the 
city's budget services manager. Most of those assessment districts pay for 
landscaping in specific communities. 
</P>
<P>
Officials stress that assessment fees are not imposed by City Hall, but rather 
result from communities' petitioning of the council. In each case, they point 
out, more than two-thirds of the districts' property owners signing petitions 
telling the council that they were willing to pay extra tax dollars to have, 
say, flowers planted along roadsides in their community. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, though, express skepticism about any attempts to portray the special 
taxes' enactment as democracy in action. True, the public must approve the 
taxes, they say, but the officeholders who propose them are not simply 
disinterested bystanders. Indeed, some political observers go so far as to 
argue that the officials shrewdly manipulate the process. 
</P>
<P>
They do so, opponents charge, by choosing what Migdal terms "sexy programs" for 
submission to the voters for extra financing. Although agreeing with that 
assertion, John McTighe, a former county policy analyst who now runs his own 
consulting firm, does not fault officials for taking that tack. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it -- if you ask people whether they want to pay more for welfare 
or things like Edgemoor (geriatric hospital), the answer probably would be no," 
McTighe said. "But government still has to provide those services, too." 
</P>
<P>
The special taxes' relatively unpainful financial effect on individuals often 
makes for persuasive campaign slogans. 
</P>
<P>
During last fall's campaign over the proposed half-cent sales tax for jails, 
for example, officials hammered away at the theme that, "for pennies a day," 
San Diegans could ensure that dangerous criminals who might otherwise go free 
because of jail crowding would be incarcerated. Similarly, Filner, who proposed 
the $50-million-a-year plan for more police, has noted that his plan would cost 
the owner of a $100,000 home $34 to $87 annually. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I have no problem asking voters, 'Is it worth that much to you?' " 
Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Numbers Don't Lie 
</P>
<P>
The incremental increases in an individual's overall tax burden produced by the 
special taxes, opponents suggest, are small enough and so widely dispersed as 
to generally avoid massive public opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Taken in isolation, none of these taxes or extra fees seems like that much 
money," Hedgecock said. "Over the years, of course, they accumulate. But, 
before you start seeing anger or majority opposition, people have to start 
doing some arithmetic. For whatever reason, that hasn't happened so far." 
</P>
<P>
Schnaubelt, whose Libertarian-cum-Republican philosophy prompted innumerable 
lectures on that topic during his years on the council, concurred with that 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the story of the frog in boiling water: If you turn up the heat 
little by little, it stays in the pot until it's too late," Schnaubelt said. 
"And that's what's happening to taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
County administrator Janssen, however, disputes such analyses. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in conspiracy theories, and that's what that sounds like," 
Janssen said. "First of all, I don't think people are that cunning or that 
smart. Plus, all I see is an honest attempt by honest people to do what's 
beneficial to the public." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood, meanwhile, views the debate as simply another chapter in a recurring 
story that he has heard often throughout his nearly four decades at City Hall 
-- one that, from his perspective, illustrates the largely no-win position in 
which public officials find themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Since before I was shaving, the only two things said around here have been, 
'We want more service and reduce the cost of government,' " Lockwood said. 
"There's a tremendous inconsistency there, because those goals have you moving 
in opposite directions. But that gap is there now, always has been there and 
probably always will be. Knowing that makes this job a little easier."

LANGUAGE STUDY PROGRAM IS A BIG SUCCESS ON A SMALL SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the 435 students at Longfellow Elementary School in Clairemont -- all of 
them native English speakers -- the language of the day is Spanish. Similarly, 
hablando Espanol is also the norm for more than 200 children at Horton 
Elementary in Southeast San Diego, while French is the langue for 80 students 
at nearby Knox Elementary. At Spreckels Elementary in University City, about 
half the school's 600 students master Spanish and English together in daily 
bilingual studies. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the little-known world of foreign language study in San Diego 
elementary schools. Out of 107 schools in the San Diego Unified district and 
more than 100 in smaller county districts, the special magnet programs at the 
four schools provide the only large-scale, continuing foreign language 
instruction for students at the elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
While the programs get high marks from teachers, parents and independent 
evaluators, their special status only points up the general lack of any 
second-language curriculum below the secondary-school level, not only in San 
Diego but throughout California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call for Expanded Programs 
</P>
<P>
A key recommendation from the June 1987 report on the future of San Diego 
schools called for foreign-language instruction for all elementary school 
students as part of expanded programs in world culture. That recommendation 
parallels conclusions in nationwide educational reports calling for teaching 
foreign language to more students and at an earlier age. 
</P>
<P>
Although local school officials have acted on many parts of the 1987 
independent study, they have offered no specifics regarding more language 
study. Even at the secondary level, administrators concede that instructional 
methods need revamping, with more emphasis on oral-based teaching and less on 
rote grammar so that students will pick up a second language in a more natural 
way. 
</P>
<P>
But the same administrators point to the existing magnet programs as good 
examples of how language instruction could better proceed if a commitment to 
extra money and time were made by members of the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Typical Classroom 
</P>
<P>
A visitor entering one of the two kindergarten classes at Longfellow Elementary 
finds all the bulletin boards in Spanish and the class divided into several 
groups, with one cluster of munchkins singing a song in Spanish while a second 
reads a story in Spanish and a third practices vocabulary using 
Spanish-language work sheets. 
</P>
<P>
From kindergarten through second grade, children receive all instruction in 
Spanish. Beginning in the third grade, they receive 75 minutes of intensive 
English immersion so that they learn to read in English. Otherwise, the class 
continues in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
A similar pattern is followed at Horton and Knox as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a real commitment by parents to place their children in such 
programs," said Tim Allen, who directs second-language instruction for the San 
Diego district. 
</P>
<P>
The language magnets fall under the district's special integration academic 
programs first set up in the late 1970s to encourage voluntary ethnic mixing 
and to avoid mandatory busing under court order. At Horton and Knox, which are 
in predominantly minority areas, the language immersions are intended to 
attract white students who live outside the area to bus to the schools. They 
have generally been successful in doing so. The only non-white students 
eligible for the immersions must live in the immediate school neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Longfellow is one of a handful of district schools without a neighborhood 
focus. All students must apply for admission. All students are selected only on 
the basis of balancing the school ethnically, and the school has a waiting 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"A key is that parents want to be certain that their children will still 
maintain their English," Allen said. "And it is usually best for a student to 
enroll beginning in an early grade." 
</P>
<P>
Longfellow magnet coordinator Helen Sabala finds that many parents who visit 
the school for the first time express both excitement and bewilderment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we teach the same basic concepts of math, reading, etc., as in other 
schools but in Spanish," she told a group of parents the other day who are 
contemplating putting their children at Longfellow next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The teachers use a lot of repetition, a lot of body movement, such as pointing 
to something," Sabala explained. "The kids listen to the Spanish and, at first, 
there are non-verbal responses" such as a student handing over an object that 
the teacher asks for in Spanish. "And that leads to natural conversation 
developing after a while." 
</P>
<P>
"We begin formal English reading at the third grade, but we really encourage 
parents to continue reading to their children in English at all grades. We'll 
take care of the Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
A district evaluation last year showed that immersion students at the 
fifth-grade level did as well on standardized English tests in math, reading 
and language as their peers at regular elementary schools. In addition, the 
evaluation showed that the students develop Spanish-language skills comparable 
to students who are native Spanish speakers. 
</P>
<P>
At Knox, teacher Kathleen Stark said that parents -- many of whom are 
Francophiles -- nevertheless do worry about whether the reading skills taught 
initially in French will transfer to English. "And they do transfer," Stark 
said. "It's sometimes quite remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
Sally McArdle at Knox, who gives the third-through-sixth graders their 
intensive English reading lessons, said that, by the second semester of third 
grade, the transfer is almost always made. 
</P>
<P>
"Most already have the reading skills, and it's just a matter of getting 
comfortable with English," she said. "It's funny when they recognize English 
vocabulary by its French roots. . . . 'That's French, isn't it?' you hear them 
say." 
</P>
<P>
At Spreckels, the bilingual magnet operates on a different philosophy. An equal 
number of native Spanish speaking and English-speaking students are grouped 
together for part of the day for music or other enrichment in Spanish or 
English, but are separated by language for part of the day for basic skills 
instruction. The Spanish speakers bus to Spreckels from Southeast San Diego; 
the English speakers are University City children whose parents choose the 
program. White students from outside the area are not eligible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support for Program 
</P>
<P>
The parents of Spanish-speaking natives have supported the Spreckels program 
strongly for almost a decade. For them, the curriculum allows their children 
not only to learn English but to maintain their Spanish, unlike regular 
district ESL instruction for the majority of Latino students, which is intended 
only to increase English fluency. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of neighborhood children have been much slower to warm to the program, 
afraid that their children would suffer by not spending their entire day in an 
English curriculum. That fear has diminished, administrators said, since the 
district added a gifted enrichment component in English to the program four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The Spanish kids hear a lot more English here than they do in ESL at a school 
predominantly Latino," Linda Giles, who teaches kindergarten at Spreckels, 
said. "And the Caucasian kids are hearing Spanish in real-life situations, too, 
such as on the playground . . . we as teachers try to give a sense of being 
truly bilingual by sometimes talking in Spanish just to show that is all right, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Added fifth- and sixth-grade teacher Ivelisse Druid: "There's lots of oral work 
here, both with teachers and with each other. And we mix some of the reading 
groups as well." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Garretson put her son, Andrew, in the program because she wants him to 
know Spanish growing up in Southern California. "I work at (UC San Diego) 
Medical Center and I know the importance of having a second language . . . and, 
while some parents do fear that the program takes away from English 
instruction, I have found that the kids do most of their reading, writing and 
math in English." 
</P>
<P>
Although Garretson considered the immersion programs, she believes in sending 
her children to neighborhood schools. 
</P>
<P>
And the Spreckels teachers, while saying that Spanish immersion for English 
speakers is a choice for parents to make, do not believe that a similar English 
immersion -- instead of a bilingual focus -- would work for Spanish speakers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sink-or-Swim English 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the Hispanic kids in sink-or-swim English would not get the 
academic support at home that Caucasian kids get in English while in a Spanish 
immersion," second-grade teacher Lydia Stevens said, adding that in the present 
immersion, the point is to teach students Spanish and not to replace their 
native language. 
</P>
<P>
Giles said research shows immersions work best when the language of immersion 
is in "the so-called lower-status language," which in the United States would 
be Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers in both the bilingual and immersion programs complained that there is 
poor articulation for graduating sixth-graders wishing to continue their 
language study at the junior-high level. Second-language coordinator Tim Allen 
conceded that the problem is not only with the lack of follow-up courses in 
most cases but with different methods of teaching at the secondary level. 
</P>
<P>
"The new framework from the California Department of Education calls for 
teaching extensively through dialogue, through oral communication, but our 
texts still emphasize orderly grammar and many of our teachers haven't had 
training in new methods," Allen said. "But this is the way we want to go, both 
at secondary and also at elementary levels, if we can begin (more widespread) 
instruction at those grades." 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Scherf, a La Jolla High foreign-language teacher who has been trained in 
the new methodology, said that "too many (secondary) students now go through a 
program and learn to conjugate and read literature, but can't speak with any 
proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"We want students to give responses that can be understood even if they are 
grammatically incorrect at first . . . with further exposure and practice, the 
errors get tidied up without resorting just to drills on verbs." 
</P>
<P>
Most students leaving the existing elementary language magnets end up in the 
more traditional programs ill-suited to the preparation they have had. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Magnet Fails to Attract 
</P>
<P>
Students in the Spreckels program are eligible to continue to a junior-high 
level bilingual magnet at Correia Junior High in Point Loma. Almost all the 
Spanish-speaking students continue to Correia, since the bus ride there is no 
longer than that to Spreckels from their Southeast San Diego homes. 
</P>
<P>
But no neighborhood magnet student from the University City area has ever 
attended Correia, because residents perceive that Standley Junior High, their 
community school, has better academic programs, teachers said. As a result, 
Correia magnet teachers must recruit new white students from the Point Loma 
area who have had little or no Spanish study and therefore are far behind their 
bilingual Spanish counterparts. And the Spreckels students who go on to 
Standley discover that the Spanish classes there are geared more for beginning 
study. 
</P>
<P>
"Standley truly has an outstanding academic program so the parents are 
reluctant to send their kids outside of the University City area," Allen said. 
"But, because of the nature of the magnet philosophy -- it is set up to promote 
integration -- the continuing magnet isn't at Standley." 
</P>
<P>
Allen has worked on getting a better relationship between teaching styles at 
Spreckels and Standley. "Since the majority of Standley classes must be geared 
to beginning students, I would like to see maybe one class geared to a 
continuation of what is done at Spreckels." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, students at Longfellow, Horton and Knox are eligible to continue 
intensive language instruction at Memorial Junior High in Barrio Logan. But the 
majority choose to attend their neighborhood junior highs, in part because 
Memorial is considered a "dangerous" school because of its location, despite a 
high-powered magnet emphasizing languages and world culture. Language classes 
at those neighborhood junior highs are also geared largely to beginning study. 
</P>
<P>
"And Memorial is not a true immersion, since we don't have that beyond the 
elementary level," Allen said. "We do have a special Spanish language-arts 
class for the immersion students" and students from Knox can take advanced 
French courses at San Diego High School on special transfers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said that teaching methodology will change significantly at the secondary 
level over the next several years, especially with new teacher training and 
with new texts becoming available in 1990. But he said that an oral-based 
foreign-language program at elementary schools depends on the philosophical 
bent of top administrators and the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
"Will foreign language be considered part of basic skills or an add-on?" Allen 
said. He noted that the district's new common-core curriculum content does not 
include additional foreign language requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the answer is going to be."

If you want to save the trauma centers, aid the needy and provide AIDS care, 
put in 25-cent toss-in baskets at so-called freeway entrances. You not only 
garner dollars but you will ease gridlock. It worked fine in Richmond, Va.

It's about time that Los Angeles residents realize it's a privilege to use a

PROPOSITION 99: 'THE BIG RAID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In six years as chief engineer and general manager of the Los Angeles City Fire 
Department, I have never felt more impelled to address the public on a pending 
community peril as I do now. Recent trauma care events in our city and 
surrounding areas have convinced me that lives are in grave jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
By way of example, on Jan. 25, in the middle of the week, eight trauma care 
centers temporarily closed due to saturation and diverted our paramedic units 
away from their vitally needed services. The closure of 19 emergency rooms on 
the same day, and for the same reason, further exacerbated the situation. We 
are drastically extending our precious transport time, delivering trauma 
patients to more distant emergency facilities. To compound matters, our fire 
companies that respond to many Emergency Medical Services calls, as well as to 
fire and similar emergency incidents, are less available due to this rapidly 
deteriorating situation. Further hospital closures that appear imminent, 
according to health officials, could cause our city's EMS system to suffer 
cardiac arrest! 
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, eight of our original trauma centers have closed permanently due to 
lack of funds for the medically indigent. With the recent announcements that 
the governor has reduced the proposed 1989 budget for medically indigent funds 
by $27 million and the inability of the county to continue its funding, many 
other hospitals have discussed closing. If this happens, our increased 
paramedic transport and out-of-service time spans will place traumatized 
citizens in mortal peril needlessly. The county does not have the financial 
resources to make up the losses of every hospital in the system. The state, 
however, does have funds available from Proposition 99, but the governor has 
diverted these funds for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
I have written the governor, urging him to redress the emergency room closure 
problems by utilizing the tobacco tax funds. You can help change his mind on 
this vital matter by also writing to him.

BLACKS ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black enrollment in the nation's colleges and universities peaked in 1980 and 
continues to decline. But the rate of decline masks two other distressing 
trends: reductions not only in absolute numbers of black male students but also 
in the ratio of black men to black women on campus. Black women now outnumber 
black men by three to one on some campuses, one of them being Princeton. Left 
unchecked, the drift could have ominous economic and social consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics from just two freshman classes pretty much tell the story, as 
related last month by the Office of Minority Concerns of the American Council 
of Education. Twenty years ago 63 black students entered Harvard as freshmen. 
Of those, 51 were men and 12 were women. Last September 138 black students were 
enrolled -- 48 men and 90 women. The total in 20 years more than doubled, but 
the number of black males declined. As an average of all American campuses, 60% 
of black college students are women. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the national trend, black enrollment at UC Berkeley, UCLA and 
Stanford is rising, but the ratio of black women to black men on the UC 
campuses is about the same as the national average, and the men are losing 
ground. Black enrollment at the USC is down, with women representing 55% of the 
total. The gap is even wider at several historically black colleges. Women 
outnumber men by 2 to 1 at Virginia's Hampton Institute, and by 5 to 1 in last 
year's freshman class at Georgia's Clark College. 
</P>
<P>
Colleges aggressively recruited blacks in the 1960s, especially after the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 prohibited federal funding for colleges that discriminated. 
Grant, work-study and tuition-loan programs enacted during the Johnson 
Administration put college within reach of more working-class and impoverished 
black students. A particularly important program was Upward Bound, a 
campus-based program to smooth the transition for black students from high 
school to college. 
</P>
<P>
The decline can be traced, at least in part, to changes in education priorities 
during the Reagan Administration. Financial aid did not keep pace with the 
soaring costs of college. The federal emphasis shifted from grants to loans. 
Work-study funds were cut by 22%. College drifted back out of reach for many 
high-school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
The changes hit black students hardest because they were, and are, 
disproportionately poor. But other factors help account for the fall in the 
percentage of black males on campus. One factor is the growing number of black 
families that are headed by young, impoverished, semi-literate single women, 
poor role models for daughters and no model at all for sons. Nor do boys often 
find role models in elementary school. Stymied by stereotypes and lowered 
expectations, too many grow up expecting not much more from life than the 
immediate gratification of a minimum-wage job or a stint in the military and 
the allure of quick profits from crime. In that hard and narrow world, there 
are few routes to college. 
</P>
<P>
More black men could beat those odds if the opportunities for success were 
bolstered in the early grades before they dropped out of school and were lost 
forever. Businesses and governments should help them beat the odds by 
supporting after-school efforts, neighborhood tutoring and church programs. 
Local celebrities and professionals can and should get involved in programs 
that help reward academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
Black students who are capable of college work should have every opportunity to 
get on campus and stay there. At predominantly white campuses, college 
presidents must work harder to eliminate racial tensions. Jacqueline Fleming, 
author of the landmark study, "Blacks in College," told the magazine Black 
Issues in Higher Education: "There is a 50-50 chance that black students in 
college anywhere will encounter personally threatening difficulties, including 
physical threats as well as covert hostilities." There is an even greater 
chance that black students will be shut out of most leadership posts and 
extracurricular activities. The campus climate must become less hostile if 
black students are to persevere successfully. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years after equal opportunity became more than a slogan, black 
Americans are the only group that is losing ground in higher education. If the 
decline continues, the disparities will widen and more black men will become 
unproductive burdens on the nation. If President Bush is to live up to his 
chosen sobriquet as the Education President, he will have to help provide real 
and broad opportunities for black students at American colleges.

QUALITY EDUCATION

<TEXT>
<P>
"Hispanic Art in the United States" opened this month at the L.A. County Art 
Museum, and every child in Los Angeles should see it. But they won't. Why? 
Because the schools no longer have money for such "luxuries" as field trips. 
This is a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The children of Los Angeles are aesthetically starved. If we want kids to stop 
spraying their names all over the city, let's show them where else to spray. 
Let's let real painters and vibrant works of art speak the message we want them 
to hear. Believe me, after working with teen-agers for 15 years, I know they're 
not listening to our words, nor are they reading letters like this. Let's 
attack their sensibilities on another front, one where they least expect a 
sermon. 
</P>
<P>
School should be the place where children learn to value culture, to respect 
just authority, to plan for the city of the future, but they cannot accomplish 
this mandate on current funding. Schools should not be beggars at the table of 
big business, waiting for a few crumbs, donations that help but cannot heal the 
wounded institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Education needs stable funding that will allow such "luxuries" as art for all. 
The choice is simple: pay for quality public education or pay for police. The 
energy we cannot direct for the good will, I fear, destroy our city.

FUMBLING ON AIDS CAUSES WASTE, SUFFERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER CASHMA; JOHN FALL, , ; ENRIC MORELLO, Peter Cashman, John Fall and 
Enric Morello are members of the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power/Los Angeles 
(ACT UP/LA). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's health-care system is increasingly unable to meet the 
needs of those who use it. People experience long waits for initial visits to 
outpatient clinics. It is not uncommon for a hospital patient to spend up to 
three days lying on a gurney in a hall until a bed becomes available. The 
system does not employ sufficient bilingual staff, so people who speak a 
language other than English often have difficulty gaining access to medical 
services. However, since we are most familiar with the problems of people with 
AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses who must use the public health facilities, we 
will speak specifically to their problems. 
</P>
<P>
The county has yet to comprehensively address the AIDS epidemic in a medically 
sound, fiscally responsible and compassionate manner. As a result, people are 
dying in unnecessary pain and emotional agony. With one-third of all people 
with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses relying on this system, it is no surprise 
that they receive substandard care. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the breakdown of the county's public health-care system has been 
obvious. Why have our public officials chosen to do nothing about it? When 
their inaction is criticized, they become defensive and reactive rather than 
creative and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
Who is in charge here? Nobody, it seems. The Board of Supervisors relies on 
whatever information or misinformation our county Department of Health Services 
provides. The Department of Health Services hides behind very real and enormous 
problems in the public health-care system instead of providing positive and 
constructive solutions. Monies are provided but not spent; $8.6 million go 
unused in this year's county AIDS budget. Services continue to go unprovided, 
facilities unrehabilitated, staff unrecruited and more patients continue to 
suffer and die needlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Since the epidemic began nine years ago, the county's only major organized 
response has been to open an outpatient clinic, which has proved grossly 
inadequate. It is so overburdened that one must wait eight weeks for an initial 
visit. People with temperatures of 103 or higher sit for hours on hard wooden 
benches waiting for help. Some receive chemotherapy in crowded hallways, 
vomiting in bags. Others in the same hallways, stripped to the waist, have IVs 
hooked to their arms. A caring staff does its best amid these poor conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the harsh reality of the outpatient clinic and with the lack of a 
dedicated AIDS ward and other health-care services, AIDS activists organized a 
grass-roots campaign to bring about sorely needed change. In 1988 a series of 
protests were organized to bring pressure on the Board of Supervisors and on 
the county Department of Health Services. The outcry was heard but the response 
meager: a 20-bed AIDS research ward to open sometime in 1990. The planned ward 
is already obsolete in the face of a current average daily census of 60 
hospitalized patients with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
California's Department of Health Services recently reported that during 1988 
the state Medi-Cal program spent twice as much money per AIDS patients in Los 
Angeles as it did for those in San Francisco. This is due primarily to the 
extended hospital stays that occur in Los Angeles: 13.3 days against 9.5 days 
in San Francisco. The report is an indictment of poor patient management, 
resulting in part from the lack of a dedicated AIDS ward in this county's 
public hospital system. Studies have shown, and the experience of private 
hospitals in Los Angeles has proved, that the length of hospital stay for 
patients in AIDS wards is shorter than for AIDS patients dispersed in the 
general hospital population. Health-care systems in other cities have a range 
of health care for people with AIDS and AIDS-related illnesses, which includes 
dedicated AIDS wards, outpatient clinics, early intervention prevention 
programs, hospices and home health-care programs. 
</P>
<P>
Are we in Los Angeles entitled to anything less? Yes, according to our 
Department of Health Services and Board of Supervisors. No, according to 
community groups who participated in the recent weeklong AIDS vigil at 
County/USC Medical Center. In the rain and cold, the community demanded a 
50-bed AIDS ward, improved outpatient services, a comprehensive countywide AIDS 
health-care plan, access to the treatments and health monitoring routinely 
available under private care, and full disclosure of the possible health risks 
in county drug-research protocols. 
</P>
<P>
We are in the midst of an epidemic that will take us beyond the year 2000. 
While it should be practicing 21st-Century medicine, this county's health-care 
system continues to function in a 19th-Century modality in early 20th-Century 
facilities. The Board of Supervisors has shown itself incapable either of 
meeting the county's immediate health-care needs or of anticipating those of 
the future. The county Department of Health Services must cease its arrogant 
posturing and be willing to provide what is needed in terms of public health. 
The supervisors must meet their obligation to provide for the public health and 
insist that those they have hired to do that job do it and do it well.

SCARCE FUNDS, MORE URGENT PROJECTS PUT MOORPARK FREEWAY YEARS AWAY FROM BEING 
WIDENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Motorists who commute on the Moorpark Freeway will encounter rush-hour traffic 
jams for at least six more years before state funds are appropriated to widen 
the four-lane highway, state and county officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Despite intense lobbying by Thousand Oaks politicians, the proposed $15-million 
widening of the freeway to six lanes faces tough competition for scarce funds 
from other highway projects, including several in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is there just is not enough money to do it all," said Hunt 
Braly, a spokesman for state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), whose district 
includes Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it won a spot by next year on a state roster of high-priority projects, 
the two-year job would rank so low that construction would not start until 1995 
at the earliest and 1999 at the latest, said Richard Spicer, acting executive 
director of the Ventura County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'By Then Unbearable' 
</P>
<P>
"By then it will be unbearable," said Thousand Oaks Councilman Lee Laxdal, a 
vocal proponent of the widening project. 
</P>
<P>
Already, residents say it can take 15 to 25 minutes in the morning to drive 
down the freeway, a 7.8-mile stretch of California 23, as traffic pours south 
into Thousand Oaks and heads east toward Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid population growth, particularly in Moorpark, is responsible for 
transforming the freeway, which longtime Thousand Oaks resident Joan Dehner 
recalls as a country road, into a morass of traffic during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
Dehner remembers when driving the scenic freeway was a pleasure. Now, "it's 
just bumper to bumper" said Dehner, 33, who works as a financial analyst for a 
local aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1987, the number of vehicles on the Moorpark Freeway between 
the Ventura Freeway and Janss Road during peak hours nearly doubled, to 6,400 
vehicles from 3,400 vehicles, according to the California Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
At some points, traffic during rush hour has already reached its design 
capacity of 8,000 vehicles per hour, the figures show. Completion in 1993 of 
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near the Tierra Rejada Road exit is 
expected to further clog the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark Freeway was built in the late 1970s with a median strip wide 
enough to expand the highway to eight lanes, said Dick Sommerhauser, a Caltrans 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, the widening of the freeway was ranked least important on a list 
of 10 proposed freeway projects in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"There are problems everywhere," said Jack Hallin, Caltrans chief of project 
development for Ventura County. "Some places it's congested or dangerous 15 
minutes a day, some, 24 hours a day. It's all relative." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Submitted Annually 
</P>
<P>
The list, compiled by the Ventura County Transportation Commission, is 
submitted annually to the state Transportation Commission, which each year 
comes up with a five-year plan to fund projects statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of California 126 between Santa Paula and Fillmore need to be widened 
for safety reasons from two to four lanes at an estimated cost of $17.6 million 
before the Moorpark Freeway widening project begins, Spicer said. 
</P>
<P>
Second on the list is to add two lanes and improve interchanges on the Ventura 
Freeway where it narrows to four lanes near Oxnard Boulevard, Spicer said. That 
project is estimated to cost $40 million, with state and local jurisdictions 
splitting the tab, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In eastern Ventura County, residents have long awaited construction of a 
2.2-mile, $40-million freeway connector between California 23 and the Simi 
Valley Freeway. Construction is to begin in 1990 and end in 1993. The Moorpark 
Freeway now ends abruptly in southern Moorpark while California 118 peters out 
in eastern Moorpark, leaving traffic to wend its way along narrow city streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concern About Connector 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks officials are concerned that once the connector is finished, easy 
access to the Moorpark Freeway will mean that even more vehicles will clog the 
highway. Laxdal even threatened that Thousand Oaks might sue Caltrans if it 
built the connector without also widening the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials dismiss the threat of such a suit. Even Laxdal recently 
agreed, at colleagues' urgings, to "put saber-rattling aside" to work with the 
state agency. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Davis and Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) have asked 
Caltrans to conduct a study of the Moorpark Freeway project. The study will be 
completed by the end of summer and will help county officials rank the project 
for the 1990 list, Hallin said.

The race for the Burbank Board of Education has attracted two political novices 
who criticize the two incumbents for their records on school repairs, improving 
the quality of education and a plan to restructure schools. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents, board President Audrey Hanson and Vice President Vivian 
Kaufman, have responded by citing their experience and agendas for upgrading 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The challengers say Hanson and Kaufman have been negligent in allowing all but 
one of the district's 17 schools to deteriorate to what officials say is the 
worst physical condition in the district's history. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates hoping to unseat the incumbents, high school teacher Denise 
Wilcox and neurosurgeon and restaurant owner S. Michael Stavropoulos, said the 
state of the schools and their need for updated plumbing and electrical 
systems, air conditioners and paint demonstrates the lack of leadership by the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbents' Response 
</P>
<P>
But Hanson and Kaufman, both 58, have insisted that the board is not to blame 
for the schools' decay. They said that they have already taken steps to repair 
the schools, and that they are prepared to propose bond issues and other 
financial measures to meet the estimated $19-million repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is starting to heat up the contest for the two board seats, which 
will be decided Feb. 28 in the city's municipal election. Although Wilcox is a 
newcomer to the Burbank political arena, she has gained momentum in recent 
weeks with the support of several local groups. She said her approach to 
education and business would give a needed jolt to the leadership of the 
11,474-student district. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running because I looked at this board and I don't think they understand 
the educational needs of our students," Wilcox, 33, said. "The deterioration 
has occurred while these people have been in office." 
</P>
<P>
The other major issue surrounding the campaign is a plan to establish four-year 
high schools and scale back elementary schools to kindergarten through fifth 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
Although the five-member board recently approved the plan, the two challengers 
said it needs to be reconsidered before it is implemented next year. They said 
not enough attention has been paid to the plan's educational and logistical 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
But Hanson and Kaufman said they stand by the plan, saying it will meet the 
educational needs of sixth-graders and ninth-graders by orienting them earlier 
to a more mature campus environment. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates do not run for specific seats. Candidates need 50% plus one vote 
to win in the election. An April runoff will be held for any seats for which 
there is no winner, with the top vote-getters claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
Board members receive a stipend of $300 a month and meet every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, who describes herself as "a wife and mother," is seeking her third term 
on the board. Kaufman, an escrow officer, is seeking a second term. Both have 
children who have graduated from the Burbank school system, and both are 
expected to do well in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, who is regarded by observers as the panel's most vocal member, said she 
is running a relatively low-key campaign. She said she feels that the board is 
moving in the right direction toward meeting district needs, and that her 
expertise on school matters would help keep the board on course. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools are moving positively, but we need to work toward higher 
standards," Hanson said. She, like the other candidates, favors asking voters 
to fund school improvements through a bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Our priorities have to be improving our facilities," she said. "We need a new 
Burbank High School and a complete remodeling of Burroughs High School. We need 
to put air conditioning in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
A report released last month by Burbank school officials detailed the poor 
physical condition of the schools. The document noted, however, that none of 
the district's 11 elementary schools, three junior high schools and three 
senior high schools have major structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank High School, which graduated its first class in 1908, needs the most 
extensive repairs, according to the report. Estimated costs include $995,315 
for ceiling-light repair and installation, and $23,850 to add building trim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of State Funds 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said the district was behind in repairing the schools because of a 
shortage of funds. State money that had been expected to help pay for the 
repairs has been cut back in recent years. Because of the shortfall, officials 
said they concentrated on making only emergency repairs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to supporting a bond issue, Kaufman said she wanted the board to 
work more closely with the Burbank City Council. She said Burbank High School, 
which is in a downtown redevelopment area, may be eligible for city 
redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things we can try that we've never tried before," Kaufman said, 
adding that she would like to see Burbank High rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman said her other priorities include adding more computers to schools and 
expanding the district's music program. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the music program as it stands is piecemeal," Kaufman said. "I would 
like to see an articulation of the music program where students know something 
about music when they get to junior high school." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox, a teacher at Monroe High School and the mother of a 4-year-old 
daughter, has never held elective office. But she has already won the 
endorsement of several labor organizations and the Burbank Board of Realtors 
during interview sessions with the groups. 
</P>
<P>
"She really had a lot of enthusiasm, and that stirred our whole panel," said 
Mark Gillenson, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers Local 18. "She seemed to have fresh ideas, and being a teacher, was 
acquainted with both sides of the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox has attacked the incumbents for the district's restructuring plan that 
would turn both Burbank and Burroughs High into four-year high schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to reassess the whole issue," she said. "The board still has no idea 
how this is going to work. The specifics of what this will do for our children 
and the specific educational details have not been addressed." 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring was to start this fall, but was postponed for a year because 
remodeling of the two high schools will take longer than originally planned. 
The delay is due to some recently discovered asbestos that was found in walls 
and insulation late last year. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was proposed three years ago. The district was faced with soaring 
costs because of increasing enrollment at elementary schools. Without the 
restructuring, officials said, the district would have been forced into opening 
another elementary school and raising operation costs. 
</P>
<P>
Although a committee composed of parents and educators worked out the specifics 
of the plan, Wilcox said that a large segment of the community did not have any 
input. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bilingual Education 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being a teacher, Wilcox, who speaks Spanish, said she had helped 
coordinate federally funded programs for bilingual students. "I can bring that 
kind of new consciousness to the board," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said that in addition to a bond issue, she would seek other ways to 
raise funds and repair schools. She said she would encourage large corporations 
around the city to "adopt schools and try to make this community more 
responsive to the district's needs." 
</P>
<P>
She said: "This board has not been aggressive enough in seeking new sources of 
revenues. They just sit back passively and wait for money to come to them." 
</P>
<P>
While Wilcox seems to be gathering gradual support in the community, 
Stavropoulos, 50, a neurosurgeon at Kaiser Permanente Hospital, has had a 
harder time getting his campaign off the ground because of his legal battles 
with the board. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos, who also owns The Golden Greek restaurant in Sun Valley, sued the 
board in October after it decided that his 14-year-old son could not attend 
John Muir High School because the family did not live in Burbank. District 
officials said evidence showed that Stavropoulos was keeping a phony residence 
so his son could attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos is appealing the decision, and the appeal will be heard before the 
board on Wednesday. However, he said he was not running to get even with the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm running to improve education," he said. "I want to fight illiteracy." 
</P>
<P>
He said he would institute an education plan for all grades with a focus on 
mathematics and sciences. "The kids are not getting taught," he said. "They are 
going to college without the right preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos echoed Wilcox's criticisms of the board in handling the 
restructuring plan and in not paying closer attention to the state of the 
schools. "No doubt about it, this restructuring plan has not been well thought 
out, and they should take it from scratch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos and Wilcox said they are not soliciting contributions for their 
campaigns. Stavropoulos said he is spending his own money "because I don't want 
to be accused of corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said, "I'm encouraging those who want to vote for me to save their 
contributions until I'm elected and can set up a campaign for a bond issue."

PUBLIC DEFENDERS TRADING UP TO PLUSH OFFICES IN VAN NUYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Deputy Public Defender Paul Enright started work at the Van Nuys 
Courthouse more than a decade ago, offices were hard to come by. Even desks 
were at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
So Enright was assigned a drawer in a desk that he would have to share with 
another public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Things have not gotten much better since then. The public defender's Van Nuys 
office has contended with cramped and makeshift quarters, faulty heating, 
unreliable air conditioning, leaky ceilings, insects and mice, said William D. 
Weiss, head deputy public defender for the Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
Now the office's tradition of hardship, austerity and clutter is about to end 
-- but not without some jealousy from courthouse colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this month, the public defenders, along with other courthouse workers, 
will begin moving into the plush, new, $52-million Van Nuys Municipal 
Courthouse. By the building's scheduled opening March 13, the 34 public 
defenders in Van Nuys expect to be ensconced in their 10th-floor suite of 50 
offices in the polished granite edifice. 
</P>
<P>
Their good fortune did not come by accident. As soon as they heard that a new 
municipal courthouse was to be built, the public defenders were first in line 
with requests for office space. 
</P>
<P>
"More or less, it was our turn," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the courthouse have been overheard grousing that the public defenders 
will occupy an entire floor of new offices. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just amazed at people's attitudes," Weiss said. "You really can feel it in 
conversations with people. The remarks are made kind of tongue in cheek, but 
you can hear the resentment." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many seem to be in awe of the spacious gray-carpeted offices, 
slate-gray mini-blinds and 360-degree views of rooftops and mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent tour of the building's 10th floor, Van Nuys Municipal Presiding 
Judge Aviva K. Bobb called it "the most beautiful place." 
</P>
<P>
It is a far cry from the office space that Deputy Public Defender Linda B. 
Schwartz remembers when she started working there in August, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Desk in the Hall 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz was luckier than Enright. She got her own desk. But the desk was in 
the hall. And she still had to bring a lamp from home. 
</P>
<P>
These days she shares an office, and there is sufficient overhead lighting. But 
on one afternoon last year, Schwartz emerged from her 10-by-10-foot office 
covered with 84 mosquito bites. 
</P>
<P>
Said fellow Deputy Public Defender Robert A. Fefferman, "I share my little 
hovel with mosquitoes, gnats, flies and the odor from overflowed toilets." 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said there is no question that "since the days we moved in here, we've 
always had the worst offices in the building. The fire marshal comes in once a 
year and busts us." 
</P>
<P>
Although Weiss was exaggerating, state fire marshals have cited the public 
defenders at least once for cluttering the hallways. The piles of papers and 
files have stayed. There simply is no space in their already brimming offices 
for the reams of paper work generated by the court system. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, word of the working conditions at the Van Nuys Courthouse had 
spread among the 540 public defenders in the county, Weiss said. People dreaded 
assignment to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't want to go to Van Nuys because of the facilities," Weiss said. 
"That was the standard statement." 
</P>
<P>
Now the public defenders look forward to projecting a more professional image 
in their future offices. 
</P>
<P>
For clients of the public defender's office, "We're often the first lawyers 
they've ever had contact with," Enright said, "and they have the stereotypical 
view of lawyers' offices as being like 'L.A. Law.' I think it's important that 
we come across like a lawyer's office." 
</P>
<P>
Some courthouse officials contend that public defenders' clients do not deserve 
access to premises that could double for a luxurious television stage set. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a little strange that their clients, who are alleged 
criminals, have an opportunity to meet with their attorneys and be interviewed 
in lovely, penthouse-type surroundings with beautiful views, while our 
witnesses are interviewed in the basement," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Leah Purwin 
D'Agostino. "I thought that was somewhat incongruous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basement Suite 
</P>
<P>
The deputy district attorneys will occupy a suite of about a dozen offices in 
the basement of the building. That is partly because they were last to ask for 
the office space, Bobb said, and partly because they do most of their work in 
their Superior Court offices anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the public defenders expressed fears that some Superior 
Court judges had coveted the public defenders' space. 
</P>
<P>
However, it would be difficult for Superior Court judges to wrest the 10th 
floor from the public defenders since the building was meant to house Municipal 
Court personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"There might have been some wishful thinking in the beginning, but that's all 
it ever was," Superior Court Judge Darlene E. Schempp said. "Everyone has said, 
'I think it's nice that the public defenders are really getting a quality place 
for a change.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Shirley Flowers, assistant Valley Division chief for Los Angeles Municipal 
Court: "I don't think there ever has been any real speculation that anyone 
could have touched the 10th floor. It's been the public defenders' space since 
the planning." 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the 11-story, 23-court building has been a long time coming. 
Originally, it was scheduled to open in August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 Opening Dates 
</P>
<P>
"We've set tentative opening dates at least five times," said Peggy 
Shuttleworth, Valley Division chief of the Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the delays led to a multimillion-dollar dispute between the 
contractor, Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp., and Los Angeles County officials, 
with both filing lawsuits against each other. The dispute has yet to be 
resolved, said Jim Abbott, senior deputy director of the county Facilities 
Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
This month, county workers began preparing the courthouse for its occupants, 
moving in furniture and applying finishing touches to fixtures. The building 
passed inspection by fire marshals Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, it's not like the other tentative opening dates that we've had," 
Shuttleworth said. "This one is much more serious than those. We're there this 
time."

FOOTNOTES: LUCKY DAY IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antitrust challenges may be holding up plans to change the name on Alpha Beta 
stores in Los Angeles, but shoppers in the gambling mecca of Las Vegas have 
already gotten Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
American Stores of Irvine, which owns Alpha Beta and last year paid $2.5 
billion for Lucky Stores, recently closed its four Alpha Beta stores in Las 
Vegas for three days, then reopened them as Lucky stores on Feb. 2. The stores 
were closed so that prices could be changed to reflect Lucky's lower prices, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
That brings the number of Lucky outlets in that market to 16. Now, all that's 
left to worry about are the 182 Alpha Betas in Southern California and the 36 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Ticket to Disaster 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes are not hazardous to your health -- at least not at Universal 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment firm's newest multimillion-dollar attraction simulates the 
deadly 8.3 earthquake that hit San Francisco in 1906. Due to open March 18, the 
shaker takes place in a San Francisco subway station and features a train 
wreck, collapsing buildings and a torrential flood -- but no injuries or deaths 
-- while the tram rolls by. 
</P>
<P>
A miracle? 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to be something that details people being horrifically 
injured," said David Weitzner, president of marketing at MCA Recreation, a 
division of Universal's parent company. 
</P>
<P>
And what if some tourists freak out during the exhibition? "That will be dealt 
with on a case-by-case basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Enemies List' for Arco 
</P>
<P>
The left-wingers at Arco are at it again, according to a new book, "Patterns of 
Corporate Philanthropy." 
</P>
<P>
The giant oil company, the book says, is a prime example of U.S. companies 
undermining their interests by giving money to "liberal" groups that "advocate 
policies hostile to corporate interests." Other offenders: AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola 
and J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Arco has been attacked by the Capital Research 
Center, a group that contends that U.S. firms are so eager to "buy off" their 
opponents that they give them money to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Arco replies that such gifts as $2,100 to Greenpeace, an environmental group, 
are merely matches to employee donations. Other gifts aid programs that don't 
conflict with Arco policy, says the Arco Foundation, which parceled out $14 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the dispute is about policy. Says one Arco employee of the Center's 
definition of undesirable causes: "Almost every organization that is dedicated 
to helping minorities is on that list." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Un-Chardonnay 
</P>
<P>
Sebastiani Vineyards rolls out a new brand of wine next month designed for 
those to whom Chardonnay means, in the words of Chairman Don Sebastiani, "This 
wine is OK." But in reality Sebastiani's Domaine Chardonnay won't contain even 
a drop of costly Chardonnay wine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it will contain a generic blend in a fancy, corked bottle. The 
resulting "dry white wine," as the label designates the contents, will retail 
at $4 to $5, pitting it against the real budget-priced Chardonnay pioneered by 
another Sonoma County winery, Glen Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
Sebastiani insists that its choice of names wasn't intended to fool consumers. 
But it did fool federal regulators who, as one put it, "assumed there was 
Chardonnay if they say Chardonnay." 
</P>
<P>
So the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has ordered Sebastiani to 
replace its labels as soon as possible with ones that relegate the name 
"Domaine Chardonnay" to small type at the bottom and state the blend's contents 
by the percentages of its low-cost grapes.

JACK SMITH: SCHOLARLY CAT CRITIC LANDS ON HIS FEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having recently mentioned the reflex gyrational mechanism by which cats right 
themselves when falling, perhaps I owe my readers a more thorough examination 
of this phenomenon and its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Casper has sent me an article from Nature magazine (April 14, 1988), by 
Jared M. Diamond, on the results of a study on falling animal bodies by W. O. 
Whitney and C. J. Mehlhoff as reported in the Journal of the American 
Veterinary Medicine Assn. 
</P>
<P>
(Casper, by the way, is the one who sent me that clipping about a dog in Buenos 
Aires that fell from a 13-story window, hit a 75-year-old woman, killing both, 
and causing another woman to be killed by a bus and a man to drop dead of a 
heart attack.) 
</P>
<P>
Happily, Whitney and Mehlhoff worked in an animal hospital in New York City, 
whose skyscrapers, open windows and hard pavements produced a data base of 132 
cats that were killed or injured by falls of two or more stories, with a 
maximum of 32 stories and a mean of 5.5 stories (one story equaling 15 feet). 
</P>
<P>
Excepting 17 cats whose owners could not afford veterinary treatment and had 
them euthanized, 90% (or 104 of 115) survived; 11 died, mostly of shock and 
thoracic injuries. 
</P>
<P>
What Diamond found most remarkable in the results was that the incidence of 
injuries and death peaked in falls of about seven stories; cats falling from 
greater heights suffered less severe injuries and were more likely to survive. 
</P>
<P>
One cat, for example, fell the maximum height of 32 stories, onto concrete, and 
"was released after two days in the hospital, having suffered nothing worse 
than a chipped tooth and mild pneumothorax." 
</P>
<P>
Human beings, on the other hand, rarely survive falls of more than six stories 
onto concrete. Higher falls are increasingly lethal. Death is caused most often 
by head injuries and bleeding from internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors found that injuries were affected by three sets of variables: the 
height of the fall determines the impact velocity; the softness of the landing 
surface affects the impact force, and five properties of the falling body are 
relevant, including its mass, shape, bone strength, cushion of fat, and use of 
muscles and joints to reduce impact force. 
</P>
<P>
Large animals (including human beings) suffer greater injuries in falls than 
smaller ones, their less favorable area/mass ratio causing higher velocities. 
</P>
<P>
Like all of us, cats have only one life each, not nine, but this popular 
misconception evidently comes from their frequent escapes from injury through 
the use of their remarkable gyroscopic system that enables them to turn in the 
air and point all four feet downward, thus dissipating the landing impact over 
all four limbs. 
</P>
<P>
Falling adult human beings tend to tumble uncontrollably, landing usually on 
their two feet, next most often on their heads. Babies, because of their larger 
heads, fall on their heads, with their arms reflexively extended to break the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
After about 100 feet, cats reach a terminal velocity of about 60 m.p.h., adult 
humans about 120. The doctors theorize that when accelerating, cats may extend 
their limbs reflexively, but on reaching terminal velocity they may relax and 
extend their limbs more horizontally, like flying squirrels, thus reducing 
velocity and spreading the impact over a greater area of their bodies. This may 
explain why cats suffer less in falls of more than 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond, a professor of physiology at UCLA Medical School, says cats share 
advantages with other small animals of similar mass and shape, but their 
gyroscopic righting reflex and their limb flexing on landing are unique. Thus, 
small dogs that fall from buildings are more prone to serious injuries or death 
than cats. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond theorizes that specific cat advantages have undoubtedly evolved through 
natural selection. "Most felid but few canid species are arboreal, so that 
millions of years of springing or falling from trees have favored those felids 
with the best vestibular systems. Thus, the nine lives of cats are a product of 
their evolutionary history." (The vestibule is a portion of the inner ear that 
is involved in balance.) 
</P>
<P>
I hope this study will not prompt anyone to drop a cat from a second-story 
window. Whatever the statistics, it doesn't do them any good, and I have an 
idea that they don't like it.

Conductor Zubin Mehta will not consider assuming the post of musical director 
of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra after Andre Previn steps down in 
1991. "I would go back to guest conduct, but it's completely inconceivable that 
I'll go back as musical director," he said in an interview in Tel Aviv, where 
he was rehearsing the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, which he serves as musical 
director. Mehta said that when he leaves the New York Philharmonic (where he is 
also music director) in 1991, "I will retire as a music director in North 
America . . . . I will have closed a certain chapter in my life." He intends to 
maintain his 28-year association with the Israel Philharmonic and dedicate the 
rest of his time to guest conducting, opera and other projects. Of Los Angeles, 
he said: "Two years ago when I conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic for six 
weeks, I was in a state of euphoria. They have remained one of the world's 
great orchestras." Mehta will lead the Israel Philharmonic on a North American 
tour that includes mid-March concerts in Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, San Diego and 
Palm Springs.

Rolling Stones fans will get some "Satisfaction" later this year when the 
legendary rock band reunites for a North American tour, said guitarist Keith 
Richards on Friday, confirming rumors of a reunion that have been reported ever 
since Richards and Mick Jagger played together in a jam session following the 
band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last month. After spending 
the past week in Barbados writing songs with Jagger, presumably for a new album 
that will be released in conjunction with the tour, Richards said that the 
Stones will tour "from around September through to December." ALEENE MacMINN

Rudolf Bing, the world renowned former Metropolitan Opera impresario, suffered 
from advanced Alzheimer's disease two years ago and thought he was an office 
worker, a psychiatrist testified Friday. Dr. Alan Tuckman, testifying at 
proceedings to annul Bing's marriage to Carroll Douglass, 48, said that the 
87-year-old Bing showed no recollection of the Metropolitan Opera, which he had 
ruled over for 22 years, or of Douglass, his second wife. The annulment 
proceedings were brought by Bing's court-appointed conservator, who contends 
that Bing was suffering from the degenerative brain disease and did not know 
what he was doing when he married Douglass at a hastily arranged ceremony two 
years ago. ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN

SHOSTAKOVICH SYMPHONY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not heard in Los Angeles since the heyday of Franz Waxman's Los Angeles 
Festival back in the early 1960s, Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony deserves the 
re-introduction offered by Jorge Mester and the Pasadena Symphony over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Everything you have heard about the Fourth is true: It is Mahlerian and 
massive, loud, excessive, sometimes uninspired, not very tuneful, long-winded, 
depressed and depressing. It is also in moments glorious, thrilling and 
engrossing. Most important -- and the best reason for its resuscitation -- it 
is pivotal in the composer's development. 
</P>
<P>
Mester and the beefed-up Pasadena orchestra -- 115 players occupied the stage 
of Civic Auditorium Saturday night -- gave what seemed a fair and informed 
reading to the 65-minute work. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't unravel all the longueurs of the enigmatic opening movement, which 
still sprawled beyond comprehension. But they did find the humor and rhetoric, 
and an admirable transparency, in the Presto. And they made eloquent and 
followable the arch of thought which moves the Menuetto into the finale, and 
seemed to enrich that experience all the way to the conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
Bombast is the trap here, but one in which the Pasadenans did not fall. Once 
beyond the numbness of the first-movement desert, interest in the orchestra 
never waned. Strong cohesion between orchestral choirs, operable instrumental 
balances, and solid solo-playing from the principal players made this a 
showcase for the ensemble as well as the composer. Holding the reins without 
strain, Mester presided over an intelligent and characterful reading.DANIEL

For the Long Beach Symphony Saturday evening, Jon Robertson was the maestro of 
the moment. Fourth in the group of guest-conducting aspirants to the music 
directorship, he offered a brace of orchestral standards, surrounding Bartok's 
First Violin Concerto, as his calling card. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson's way with Richard Strauss' "Don Juan" was fiercely dramatic and 
almost angular at times. When the passions turned introspective, however, the 
performance deflated. 
</P>
<P>
In Dvorak's Symphony No. 7 in D minor, Robertson kept control of the lyrical 
and dancing music as well as the brooding pathos, and built imposing climaxes 
for the second movement and finale. His was a consistently somber view of the 
work, with bittersweet, even stern, undercurrents to the most radiant surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra honored Robertson's intentions with strong, focused playing, 
including herculean brass work. The parade of guest conductors seems to be 
taking a toll in ensemble finesse, however, and unfamiliarity with Robertson's 
unusual seating plan -- the violin sections positioned antiphonally to his left 
and right, with the cellos and basses where the second violins commonly sit -- 
may have contributed to the unsettled balances and entrances in the opening 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the rapt, lyrical effusions of the Bartok Concerto, Jaime Laredo's 
account proved surprisingly aloof. Playing from the score, he provided 
endlessly sweet, sure sounds and worked up some fiddling fury in the second 
movement, but the results sounded musically and emotionally light. Robertson 
&amp; Co. backed Laredo with neat, supportive accompaniment. JOHN HENKEN

A sketchbook belonging to the British poet and artist William Blake that sold 
125 years ago for the equivalent of $30 is expected to fetch about $875,000 
when it comes up for auction next month at Christie's in London. "The works of 
William Blake have been in such demand for so long that it is rare for anything 
by him to come to market now," said the head of English watercolors and 
drawings at Christie's. Blake, who died in 1827, earned a meager living as an 
engraver while writing and publishing poems on biblical and mythological 
subjects illustrated with his own colored engravings. ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE

CONDUCTOR MILLER, PIANIST NAOUMOFF AT MUSIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Friday night, for the second consecutive week, a Los Angeles Philharmonic 
program offered the premiere of a work by a living American composer, a 
concerto played by a pianist of French conservatory training and, after 
intermission, a work from the standard symphonic repertory. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, no scandal enlivened the Philharmonic's performance in the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
David Alan Miller, the orchestra's assistant conductor, led a mostly uneventful 
concert which opened with a charming, six-minute appetizer, crested on some 
elegant, if Romanticized, Mozart and closed with an overblown and noisy reading 
of Mahler's First Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Raucousness is an infrequent, unwelcome guest at Philharmonic events in the 
Pavilion. With his precise but unmellow approach to Mahler, Miller seemed to 
invite wiry string sounds, poor instrumental-choir blends and tinny brass 
playing back into the lively acoustic of the hall. The conductor's strong sense 
of pacing at least kept the noise-engine on track, and rolling. But the blast 
was not pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
And it was surprising, considering with what sensitivity and full contrasts the 
reduced Philharmonic had accompanied Emile Naoumoff in Mozart's G-major 
Concerto, K. 453. 
</P>
<P>
The young, Bulgarian-born pianist exhibited admirable lightness and impeccable 
technical resources -- masterful trills, exquisite soft-playing, articulate 
detailing -- in combination with a bracing directness of expression. Obviously 
an accomplished and serious Mozartean -- which is to say, a musician of 
substance -- Naoumoff's next visit here ought to reveal his Chopin-esque 
side.DANIEL CARIAGA

4 NEW JAPANESE DIRECTORS BOW IN 'MAD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The original title of the sleek and breezy "I'm Plenty Mad!" (Little Tokyo 
Cinema 1) is "Bakayaro!" which translates as "Fool!" and is the most common 
Japanese expression of exasperation. Composed of four comical vignettes written 
by director Yoshimitsu Morita, the film introduces four promising new 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
All four stories are slight, which is generally the case with the omnibus film, 
yet each reveals the impassioned desire of an individual to smash through the 
traditional Japanese custom of maintaining a facade of polite impassiveness 
even in the face of extreme provocation. 
</P>
<P>
All four have their slack moments, but they are very contemporary and their 
casts young, capable and attractive. "I'm Plenty Mad!" is like a breath of 
fresh air amid Shochiku studio's usual genre offerings. 
</P>
<P>
In "What's Wrong With Eating?" shy, diminutive Shizuka (Haruko Sagara) has a 
tall, handsome and prosperous fiance (Tsuyoshi Ihara) so exacting that he 
checks out the labels on all her clothes and accessories -- "So-so but 
standard," he declares -- before making love to her, then backs out because 
he's convinced that she's put on three centimeters (just a little over an inch) 
on her waistline. This is only the beginning with this impossible guy, the kind 
women complain about to Dear Abby and Ann Landers. 
</P>
<P>
The beautiful and elegant Sae (Narumi Yasuda) in "Too Far to Love" has an 
equally vexing problem: She lives so far from the center of Tokyo with her 
widowed, ailing father that she has no time for a serious romance with her 
frustrated boyfriend (Hiroshi Isobe). The first was directed by Eriko Watanabe, 
who has her own theatrical company, and the second by Tetsuya Nakajima, a TV 
commercials director; their work is graceful and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
Morita's former assistant, Takahito Haro, directed "Put Yourself in the 
Driver's Seat," which chronicles an evening with a nice-guy taxi driver (Yasuo 
Daichi) in Tokyo, a city more grueling to drive in than either Los Angeles or 
New York. Nice comic touch: Among the variety of people Daichi picks up is a 
veteran cabbie who on his day off works out his hostilities on his fellow taxi 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The last and the strongest of the four is "To Hell With English," which tells 
of a young executive (Kaoru Kobayashi) desperately trying to master English in 
preparation for running his company's Chicago office. Kobayashi is a delight as 
this game, severely put-upon fellow, and Leo Mengetti offers us a definitive 
portrayal of the loud-mouthed ugly American businessman. A veteran of music 
videos, Yukihiko Tsutsumi directs with much energy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Plenty Mad!" (Times-rated Mature for adult situations and some blunt 
language -- in English) leaves us wanting to see more of its young talent on 
both sides of the camera.

The U.S. government has continued to sell millions of dollars worth of tritium 
-- crucial to the manufacture of nuclear weapons -- while saying that there may 
not be enough of the gas to continue production, it was reported. The only 
reactors able to make the rapidly decaying radioactive gas in the United States 
are at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, which was closed last April. 
The Energy Department has said there may be an urgent shortage by year end. But 
the New York Times, citing private experts, said the commercial sales to 
American and foreign companies indicate the situation may not be as serious as 
the department suggested. However, Troy Wade, acting assistant secretary of 
energy for defense programs, told the paper that the sales were small and that 
the possible shortage was not exaggerated.

SEA LION DEATHS BLAMED ON NETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal biologist says the unusually large number of sea lion carcasses on 
Southern California beaches probably can be traced to an increase in the squid 
population. Sea lions apparently have congregated to dine on the squid, and 
drowned after getting tangled in fishermen's nets, said Joe Cordaro, a wildlife 
biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. The marine animals drown 
in nets at the rate of 2,600 a year off the Southern California coast, and 
those deaths don't violate any fisheries law or threaten the population, he 
said. The number of carcasses washing ashore -- 56 since Jan. 21 in Orange and 
Los Angeles counties -- represents a small fraction of that total, Cordaro 
said. One of the dead sea lions was shot, but most of the rest are believed to 
have drowned in gill nets used to catch halibut, he said. Cordaro discounted 
allegations made Friday by a conservation group called the Sea Shepherd 
Conservation Society that fishermen have been killing the animals by feeding 
them fish stuffed with explosives.

Black South African activist Winnie Mandela, the wife of jailed African 
National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela, joined in beating some boys 
allegedly abducted by her unofficial bodyguards, a major Johannesburg newspaper 
reported. It was the first published report asserting that Mandela herself 
participated in the alleged beating. The Sunday Star, a newspaper that opposes 
apartheid, said she whipped four boys brought to her house in Soweto last month 
by young men loyal to her who call themselves the Mandela United soccer club. 
One of the boys, 14-year-old Stompie Mokhetsi, is missing and feared dead. The 
report deepened the controversy surrounding Mandela, who has denied any 
wrongdoing.

President Bush moved on his promised review of U.S.-Soviet relations in a 
meeting at his weekend retreat in Kennebunkport, Me., with a group of academics 
in the field. Earlier, Bush and his wife, Barbara, marked the first Sunday of 
Lent by attending an hourlong service at the First Congregational Church where 
they were warmly welcomed. After lunch, the President met the professors from 
Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Fletcher School of 
Law and Diplomacy and a fellow from the Brookings Institution who were brought 
in on short notice. Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the discussion was 
meant to be "open-ended and not designed to focus on any particular facet of 
East-West relations." Also at the meeting were National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state-designate.

Rep. George Brown (D-Calif.) asked the Pentagon to keep the Norton Air Force 
Base stores and clinic open after the rest of the base closes as part of a 
proposed nationwide cutback in military installations. Brown said in a letter 
to Acting Air Force Secretary James McGovern that nearly 10,000 retirees living 
nearby rely on the facilities. A special commission has recommended to Congress 
that Norton and 85 other installations be shut down because they are unneeded.

The mail escaped unscathed but a greater-alarm fire caused an estimated $10 
million damage to structures, equipment and empty mail bags at the U.S. Postal 
Service's bulk mail center in Richmond. About 150 postal employees were 
evacuated from the center as the predawn blaze began to spread. There were no 
reports of injury. The cause of the fire was not immediately determined.

WINDS DELAY LAUNCH OF DELTA 2 ROCKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force delayed the maiden launch of its new Delta 2 rocket at the last 
minute and rescheduled blastoff for Tuesday because of unexpected high-altitude 
winds, officials said. The 128-foot, three-stage rocket, carrying a $65-million 
advanced navigation satellite, had been scheduled to be launched during the 
afternoon from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station adjacent to NASA's Kennedy 
Space Center in Florida. But with the countdown in a planned 10-minute hold at 
the T-minus 4-minute mark, Air Force mission managers decided to postpone the 
flight for 48 hours. An Air Force spokeswoman said winds between 14,000 feet 
and 18,000 feet were from the northwest and that the rocket's guidance computer 
was expecting more southwesterly winds. Such winds could have "adverse 
aerodynamic effects," she said.

ALBERT BARRERA SAYS HIS CAREER MAY BE IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Albert Barrera, who says his career as a trainer may be in jeopardy, plans to 
appeal any sanctions that may be made against him in the state's widening 
investigation into the drugging of horses with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"A six-month suspension would end my career," Barrera said. "I learned how to 
train horses from my father, and something I didn't learn from him was to give 
horses cocaine and other drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera, Albert's father and a member of racing's Hall of Fame, is another 
of six trainers who are under investigation for having run horses with cocaine 
in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
The first positive laboratory test came on a horse trained by Roger Stein last 
October at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the names of both Barreras, three-time Eclipse Award winner Wayne 
Lukas and Bryan Webb and Anthony Hemmerick were added to the list of trainers 
whose horses have tested positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera played a part Sunday in what appeared to be an inconsistent 
decision by the Santa Anita stewards. In effect, the three stewards said that 
Albert Barrera's horses would have to be transferred to another trainer in 
order to run anymore, but they are allowing Laz Barrera and Lukas to continue 
their operations. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Len Foote, the executive secretary of the California 
Horse Racing Board, explained the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of tests from samples taken as far back as last summer, it is our 
thinking that the trainers have continued participating for several months in 
the interim without any positive tests," Foote's statement said. "Obviously, in 
these cases, there is no clear and present danger that horses now in their 
stables have been treated with prohibited substances. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . The board of stewards at Santa Anita has checked the stables of 
trainers D. Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera and determined the current operations 
are being conducted within the regulations of the California Horse Racing 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the two trainers will be allowed to continue racing at this 
meeting until a formal hearing is held. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be made clear that positive tests for prohibited drugs from current 
samples will continue to be treated with an assumption of clear and present 
danger, and the board of stewards may prohibit the trainer from further 
participation for the protection of the public." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera said that two of his horses -- one that ran the same day that 
another horse tested positive and Perceive Arrogance, the second-place finisher 
in the $500,000 Strub Stakes a week ago, have both tested negative. 
</P>
<P>
"With all this going on, I was really worried about the test on Perceive 
Arrogance," he said. "If he had tested positive, that would have been the end. 
The owner (Glen Laken of Chicago) would have lost his $100,000 share of the 
purse, and I know he would have taken the horse away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Had the stewards indefinitely stopped Lukas and Laz Barrera from running their 
horses, Santa Anita's racing program would have been severely impacted. Both 
trainers have full barns and Lukas, operating at tracks coast to coast, runs 
quality horses in more races than any conditioner in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas and Laz Barrera probably would have sought a court injunction if their 
horses had been banned. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera, who has only five horses, has hired an attorney and indicates 
that he will take action similar as Stein. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, who sent all but one of his horses to an assistant, Willie Washington, 
says he will file a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against California racing 
authorities because of the damage he alleges they've done to his career and 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The Stein and Albert Barrera positives were caught the first time the horses' 
urine was tested. 
</P>
<P>
The other positives resulted from frozen urine samples that were re-tested 
after they showed nothing suspicious the first time. The California Horse 
Racing Board is in the process of re-testing about 10,000 frozen samples. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera's positive resulted from a race earlier this month at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera and Lukas had positive tests for horses that ran within two days of 
each other last summer at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The other positives, which all involve thoroughbreds, are from races in 
September, Webb's horse running in the California State Fair at Sacramento and 
Hemmerick's at the Los Angeles County Fair at Fairplex Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Stein, who was suspended for six months and fined $2,000 by Santa Anita 
stewards shortly after his horse tested positive, has obtained a court 
injunction and is also appealing the ruling before an administrative law judge 
assigned by the California Horse Racing Board. 
</P>
<P>
The second day of hearings in the Stein case is scheduled in Los Angeles 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera said that he expects a ruling from the Santa Anita stewards 
after a hearing with them on Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire racing board . . . is very concerned about preserving the integrity 
of racing," Leslie Liscom, chairman of the racing board, said Sunday. "On the 
other hand, we certainly have no intention of personally hurting any trainer's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"In these latest cases, we have had reports from our testing lab, which have 
been confirmed by another lab, of the existence of cocaine in these horses. But 
these reports are only the first step in our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera has requested a split urine sample from his horse that tested 
positive and says that he is going to send it to an independent lab for another 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that if the independent lab comes up with a negative, then the 
positive result would be overturned," Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrera, 34, has been training for 14 years. He was in New York until five 
years ago, when he came to California to help his father, who was ill. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera suggested that he, Stein and the others might have stronger 
appeals because the cocaine positives have touched giants of the turf such as 
his father and Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to see this happen to anybody else, and certainly not my 
father," Barrera said. "But until the others got hit, it looked like I was 
really the bad guy in all this. And it was getting pretty lonely at the 
bottom."

UCLA GETS LAST-SECOND HOUSE CALL, 77-75; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS SHOCK NO. 4 LOUISVILLE ON OFFICIAL'S CONTROVERSIAL GOALTENDING DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
UCLA's mastery of Louisville in Pauley Pavilion, which now spans four games, 
continued Sunday on a shot that never went through the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any wonder the Cardinals have never won at Westwood? 
</P>
<P>
UCLA won this time on a goaltending call by official Willis McJunkin, who ruled 
that Louisville's Pervis Ellison batted away a last-second shot by Pooh 
Richardson as the ball made its downward arc toward the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
The call, which even the partisan crowd of 12,547 would probably call 
charitable, gave UCLA a 77-75 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It left Louisville stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if there's even a UCLA fan in here who feels that was goaltending," 
Louisville Coach Denny Crum calmly told a radio audience back home. "That ball 
was hit on the way up. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to get one taken away from (us) like that. But it happens. The 
(official) made a mistake. I don't think it was intentional. He just made a 
mistake. The guy made an honest mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"But you hate to have your kids play that hard and come back and then have a 
call like that decide the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The players ought to decide it." 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which had overcome a 13-point second-half deficit, was setting up 
for a final shot when Kenny Payne made an errant pass toward mid-court. 
Teammate LaBradford Smith had cut toward the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 10 seconds remained when Richardson chased down the loose ball along 
the left sideline, drove toward the left corner and stopped to shoot from about 
18 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told us that if we had a break situation, don't bother calling time 
out," Richardson said. "He said, 'Just get the basket.' " 
</P>
<P>
Richardson did -- eventually. 
</P>
<P>
His first shot, though, sailed over the far side of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Smith hit his elbow as he shot, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, it didn't matter because, in the scramble for the rebound, the ball 
hit several players before popping out to Richardson, who charged toward the 
hoop after he shot and took the rebound just outside the paint. 
</P>
<P>
With only a second or two remaining, Richardson quickly let loose about a 
six-foot shot, only to have the 6-foot-9 Ellison rise to deflect it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what happened," Richardson said. "I just saw that Pervis had his 
hand on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Was it goaltending? 
</P>
<P>
Ellison said he wasn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lobbying for it," Richardson said. "And when they said, 'Count it,' I 
just left." 
</P>
<P>
McJunkin signaled that the shot was good, then did so again after huddling for 
only a few seconds with his partners, Tom Harrington and Booker Turner. As Crum 
ran onto the floor to protest, McJunkin ran off toward the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
All three officials later told a pool reporter that Ellison deflected the shot 
as it made its downward arc. However, television replays clearly showed that 
the ball was on its way up. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Jim Harrick wasn't about to quibble. The victory over the 
fourth-ranked Cardinals (17-5) was UCLA's sixth straight, improved the Bruins' 
record to 16-5 and probably will vault them into the top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Harrick said he hadn't seen the game-winning play. 
</P>
<P>
Said the Bruins' first-year coach: "I saw (Richardson's first shot) go sailing 
over the basket and I'm saying, 'My lands, he didn't miss it that far?' I 
didn't even hear the whistle blow (in the confusion that followed). 
</P>
<P>
"And then I see our guys jumping up and down and running to the locker room. I 
looked at (assistant Paul) Landreaux and said, 'What happened?' " 
</P>
<P>
UCLA had survived, that's what. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first 30 minutes, the Bruins had threatened to run away from the 
Cardinals, building a 58-45 lead with 11:08 left. 
</P>
<P>
To that point, a missed shot wasn't Louisville's best play, as Harrick, 
marveling at the Cardinals' athletic ability, had said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville had one offensive rebound in 29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But, facing their worst loss of the season, the Cardinals then started to 
rebound better and outscored UCLA, 13-0, in 3:14. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, which got 22 points from Payne and 19 points and 12 rebounds from 
Ellison, eventually forged a 73-69 lead. But, after UCLA's Darrick Martin made 
a three-point shot to make it 73-72 with 1:53 left, Louisville's Keith Williams 
dropped a pass out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals got a break a moment later, though, when Richardson lost control 
of the ball as he went up for a jumper. Ellison batted the ball ahead to Smith, 
whose rim-rattling dunk gave Louisville a 75-72 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson, who led UCLA with 21 points and 13 rebounds, then made two free 
throws to make it 75-74 and Smith then threw a pass out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
A free throw by Martin with 41 seconds left tied the score and gave Louisville 
one last chance to make another turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Cardinals wanted to get the ball in the hands of a guard and then 
have Payne and Ellison post up underneath, but Payne threw it away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame we couldn't control the ball any better than that," Crum said. 
"We didn't do a very good job with it. 
</P>
<P>
"You get what you earn." 
</P>
<P>
And, in UCLA's case, perhaps even some you don't earn. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
All five UCLA starters scored in double figures, including freshman guard 
Darrick Martin, who had 17 points, four assists and three steals and made about 
a 40-foot shot from mid-court at the end of the half, and freshman forward Don 
MacLean, who made seven of 12 shots and had 16 points and seven rebounds in 
only 24 minutes. . . . Keith Williams made five of six shots and scored 13 
points for Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Wilson made only seven of 18 shots and Pooh Richardson made only four of 
12 as UCLA shot .391, its worst shooting performance of the season, but 
outrebounded Louisville, 43-38. . . . Louisville wound up with nine offensive 
rebounds, eight of them in the last 11 minutes. . . . UCLA, which leads the 
series, 8-4, is 0-3 against Louisville in Freedom Hall at Louisville. . . . 
UCLA will play Arizona State Thursday night at Tempe, Ariz.

MALONE HAS WEST IN TUNE; 
</P>
<P>
UTAH FORWARD SCORES 28 POINTS TO GET MVP AWARD

<P>
It is an old story, one repeated so often by so many that it seems as if it the 
truth got lost in the translation. But Karl Malone, who told the tale again 
here Sunday, not only attested to its authenticity but effectively used it to 
make a point. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got drafted, we were in an elevator and a lady asked what we 
did," Malone said. "We said we were Jazz players, and she said she was going to 
go around the corner and see us play. But the only thing around the corner was 
a nightclub." 
</P>
<P>
For those who did not know the occupation of Malone and his Utah Jazz cohort, 
John Stockton, they may have a better idea after their instrumental 
performances in Sunday's National Basketball Assn. All-Star game. A record 
All-Star crowd of 44,735 and a national television audience, watched Malone 
score 28 points and get nine rebounds to earn the most valuable player award, 
and Stockton fill injured Magic Johnson's role as playmaker to lead the Western 
Conference to a 143-134 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Little seen outside the Mountain time zone, and rarely heard from now that the 
boisterous Frank Layden has retired, Utah was put on the NBA map Sunday, thanks 
to these Jazz players who improvised better than anyone during the league's 
annual jam fest. 
</P>
<P>
As in any All-Star gathering, the subplots were numerous: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, playing in his 18th and final All-Star game, had to 
wait until the final 24 seconds before making his last skyhook in All-Star 
competition. He missed four earlier skyhooks and one three-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seattle's Dale Ellis proved himself worthy of a starting guard spot on the 
West roster, after all. Ellis, helped along by ballot stuffing from SuperSonic 
employees and fans, scored 27 points, making 12-of-16 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, the All-Star game did, indeed, press on despite the conspicuous 
absence of Johnson and Boston's Larry Bird. This one may not have rated high on 
the thrill-o-meter, but it had its moments, thanks primarily to Malone and 
Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, matched against Philadelphia 76ers forward Charles Barkley, made his 
presence felt early. He made eight-of-nine shots in the first half, when the 
West built a 28-point lead that was too much for the seemingly more-talented 
East to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
And Stockton, filling in as the West's point guard in lieu of the injured 
Johnson, pulled off a rare triple-double. He finished with 11 points, 17 
assists and 12 turnovers. Despite the occasional sloppiness, however, Stockton 
dictated the flow of the game as well as Johnson has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very honored to get this," Malone said. "I guess for this one day, you 
guys (sportswriters) picked me as the best player in the world. It's nice to 
get the recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the 6-foot-9, 250-pound Malone has become quite a presence. His 29.6 
scoring average ranks second in the league behind Michael Jordan's 34.3, and 
Malone ranks fifth in the league in rebounding with 11.4 per game. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps it took a vehicle such as the All-Star game for Malone's talents to 
reach a wider audience. He already, it seems, has convinced his peers of his 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl is incredible," Portland Trail Blazers guard Clyde Drexler said. "To be 
that strong and that fast. He should be outlawed." 
</P>
<P>
Even the outspoken and ultra-confident Barkley admitted that Malone is a force 
not easily dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
"People now gotta know the guy's a monster player," Barkley said of Malone. 
"You'd have to be an imbecile not to know this guy's not a great player. Guys 
like him don't grow on trees. I mean, the guy is averaging 30 points a game. 
That's monstrous. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you think about it, he had a bad day, if you go by his average. He's 
averaging 30, and he only scored 26 (28, actually). That's a bad day for him." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, as polite as Barkley is outrageous, spread the credit for his MVP 
selection, thanking everyone from Stockton to his mother to West Coach Pat 
Riley of the Lakers. All had a hand in making it possible. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton, of course, fed the ball to Malone, as he usually does during the 
season. And Riley said that, without Johnson as his point guard, he might as 
well run a version of Utah's offense and see what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Magic, we needed a playmaker supreme," Malone said. "I would like to 
split this award right down the middle and give half of it to John. I guess he 
wanted to reward me for running the court. Every time, I got out on the (fast) 
break . . ., he would get me the ball. That's how it worked today." 
</P>
<P>
Malone, however, made his own opportunities, as well. Midway through the third 
quarter, Malone stripped the ball from Boston's Kevin McHale, who was posting 
low for a baseline jump shot. After Stockton retrieved the ball to begin the 
fast break, Malone filled the lane, scored a layup and was fouled on the play. 
He made the free throw, too. 
</P>
<P>
Stockton played 32 minutes, more than any other West player. But he did not 
want to take the credit Malone gave him for running the offense and running the 
East off the court in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Karl deserved this on his own. He works hard for every basket, you can see 
that. I just tried to play the best I could. I didn't feel the pressure 
replacing Magic. I can't replace Magic Johnson. Nobody can do that. Today was 
just one of those days when I saw the floor real well and everybody just 
anticipated the passes." 
</P>
<P>
Said Barkley: "I think John Stockton is a great player, a great guy. But he's 
not Magic Johnson. He's not 6-9. . . . But he's a great player. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (the West) had an advantage with John and Karl playing together." 
</P>
<P>
There was a certain rhythm between the Jazz players that wasn't there among 
other players, thrown together for this ad lib act. 
</P>
<P>
Without the steadying influence usually provided by Bird, who missed his first 
All-Star game because of an injury, the East appeared ragged and even a bit 
disorganized in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The East, which shot only 40% in the first half, knew it might have been in for 
a long day when Dominique Wilkins, Barkley and Moses Malone all jumped for the 
same pass from Isiah Thomas. They crashed into each other, and the ball went 
out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The East suffered other indignities. Wilkins missed an uncontested layup, got 
the rebound but missed a follow-up shot. McHale got Wilkins' second miss and 
finally scored a basket. Wilkins, playing with an injured thumb, made only 
three of eight shots in 15 minutes of action. East Coach Lenny Wilkens 
approached Wilkins and apologized for not using him more, and Wilkins accepted. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem with that," Dominique Wilkins said. "I wasn't playing well." 
</P>
<P>
According to Barkley, the East came out with a different strategy in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to score some points," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the West's lead, which had swelled to 30 points in the first 
half, dipped to as few as seven in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The East did have some highlights, most provided by Jordan and Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who tied Malone for high-scoring honors with 28 points, treated the 
crowd to his repertoire of dunks and gravity-defying inside moves. 
</P>
<P>
His best might have come late in the first half, when Thomas found himself 
leading a three-on-none fast break, with Jordan and Barkley trailing him. 
Without looking behind him, Thomas tossed the ball off the backboard, whereupon 
Jordan executed a windmill dunk. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who had 19 points and 14 assists, even set himself up for a spectacular 
play late in the third quarter when he drove through the lane, made what in 
effect was a lob pass to himself, caught it and flipped in a layup. 
</P>
<P>
But even Thomas wasn't flawless, commiting six turnovers. Maybe not having 
Johnson, his friend and motivating force, affected his play. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely missed the Magic show," Thomas said. "He adds so much flair and 
so much excitement to the game." 
</P>
<P>
Except for possibly Denver Nuggets Coach Doug Moe, who said that the Laker 
center did not belong on this year's All-Star team, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 
participation in the All-Star game also will be missed. Abdul-Jabbar, who 
wasn't sure himself that he should have been included, said he enjoyed himself, 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy to be a part of it," Abdul-Jabbar said. "The way things worked out 
(for him to make the team) was kind of mystical. But it worked out, and we won 
for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Malone and Stockton helped make that possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I read a story in USA Today that said this game wouldn't be the same without 
Magic and Bird," Malone said. "I cut that article out . . . on the plane ride 
to Houston and read it again. It inspired me. The NBA has a lot of great 
athletes, and I thought this was a situation where other athletes could really 
show themselves."

BOWMAN GETS TO WORK, WINS MEN'S SKATING TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Christopher Bowman has been the most talked-about man in figure 
skating. On Sunday at the Baltimore Arena, it was for all the right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is still recovering from a severe leg injury suffered in December, 
Bowman, 21, of Van Nuys, fought through the fatigue in a strenuous 4 1/2-minute 
long program to win the men's title at the U.S. figure skating championships. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman finished first in the long program, which accounts for 50% of the final 
score, and moved from second to first in the overall standings ahead of Daniel 
Doran, 22, of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
But second place is a breakthrough for Doran, who finished third in 1986 and 
fourth in 1987 and 1988. He and Bowman will represent the United States next 
month at Paris in the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
Not going is Paul Wylie, 24, of Denver, who was supposed to duel Bowman for the 
championship. But Wylie, who, like Bowman, was on the Olympic team, finished 
sixth in the compulsory figures Thursday and fourth in the original program and 
could rise no higher than third overall after his second-place finish in the 
long program. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie received the only standing ovation of the afternoon from the crowd of 
8,358. At least one of the nine judges shared the fans' enthusiasm, awarding 
Wylie a perfect score of 6.0, the first and last one of the championships, for 
his style and composition. If Wylie's routine had been more technically 
difficult, he might have won the long program and moved into second place ahead 
of Doran, who was fifth in the long program. 
</P>
<P>
Wylie, who was discouraged enough to consider retirement last week, said Sunday 
that he had decided to remain in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost applauded when Paul said he wanted to continue," said Frank Carroll, 
who coaches Bowman in Burbank. "If Paul had won the long program today, I 
wouldn't have had difficulty reconciling that." 
</P>
<P>
Wylie is extremely popular within the figure skating community, a polite, 
well-spoken Harvard junior who sometimes sings hymns to himself to calm his 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
Don't invite Wylie and Bowman to the same party. It's not that they aren't 
friends; they are. It's that Bowman prefers life on the wild side. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who has been coaching Bowman for almost 17 years, remembers the day 
Bowman earned his first 6.0 in the 1985 Olympic Festival at Baton Rouge, La. 
But he has more vivid memories of the night before. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been running around with his friends in the middle of the night," 
Carroll said. "The night before the long program, I took him to my hotel room. 
I had two beds. I told him, 'You little turkey, you're going to get into that 
bed and stay in it. If the hotel burns down, you burn down with it. I'll send 
your ashes back to Van Nuys.' " 
</P>
<P>
Stories such as that have earned Bowman a reputation as figure skating's bad 
boy. But in most other sports, he might be considered quite normal for his age. 
</P>
<P>
"The figure skating establishment wants people in a certain mold, very 
conservative, very Ivy League," he said. "Christopher doesn't fit that mold. 
He's an individual. No matter what anyone says, he's going to do his own 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
As for the critics who question his dedication, Bowman said that his triumph 
here vindicates him. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the national championship has been my goal since I was a little boy," 
Bowman said. "I've had my ups and downs, but I made it. I don't see how anybody 
can read that as anything but total dedication." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that he went to bed at 8 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Right," Carroll said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
On the ice Sunday, Bowman was a rebel without a pause. He has been known in the 
past more as a performer than an athlete, hence the nickname "Bowman the 
Showman," but his long program was more difficult than those skated by any of 
his competitors. He did seven triple jumps, including the most demanding one of 
them all, a 3 1/2-revolution triple axel. He also did the most demanding 
combination, a triple lutz-triple toe. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Wylie didn't do a triple axel, even though he had one planned, and 
his combination was a triple lutz into a double toe, which he didn't land 
cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
"I can kick myself for the rest of the year for that," Wylie said of his 
decision to turn his triple axel into a single. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman was far from perfect. That might have had something to do with his 
conditioning. He suffered a deep cut in his left shin during an exhibition in 
early December and was wearing a cast until Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told him the injury would keep him out of the nationals," Carroll 
said. "Christopher said, 'The hell it will.' " 
</P>
<P>
After returning to the ice, Bowman pulled a groin muscle and wasn't able to 
spend as much time training as he would have liked before arriving here. By the 
end of his performance Sunday, he seemed to be gasping for breath. But he still 
hit a triple flip-double toe combination late in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Only Christopher would have been able to pull that off at the end like that," 
Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
Skating Notes 
</P>
<P>
Several judges told Frank Carroll that Christopher Bowman should try a more 
flamboyant look this year. Though Bowman is more comfortable in basic black, 
Carroll put him in black velvet with gold and silver lame brocade and sequins. 
When Bowman entered the locker room before Sunday's performance, he dared the 
other skaters to laugh. "The first thing I said was, 'Anybody who says 
anything, I'm going to break your neck.' "

<P>
Jack Nicklaus putted superbly Sunday against younger rivals Curtis Strange, 
Greg Norman and Isao Aoki and earned $254,250 in the inaugural Australian Super 
Skins golf tournament at Port Douglas, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus, 49, birdied three of the first nine holes Sunday to win $126,000 and 
received an additional $33,250 when the final five holes and two playoff holes 
all were halved. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, the U.S. Open champion, won $173,250 to finish second. Norman, of 
Australia, won $132,750 with a strong finish, and Aoki, of Japan, collected 
$47,250. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus and Strange each won $94,500 Saturday, the opening day of the 36-hole 
event over the par-72 Mirage Country Club course. 
</P>
<P>
The total purse was $607,500, plus hole-in-one bonuses worth $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the skins format, prize money for each hole increases unless the hole is 
won outright. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus began Sunday superbly, earning $18,000 for a birdie at the par-four 
first hole, where he sank a three-foot putt, and $18,000 for a birdie at the 
par-four No. 4, where all three of his rivals squandered birdie opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Nicklaus then thrilled the gallery by making a 12-foot putt on No. 9 for his 
second straight birdie at the hole and $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Mowry made a five-foot par-saving putt on the 18th hole to edge Al 
Geiberger and Miller Barber by one stroke and win the 50th PGA Seniors 
Championship at Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Mowry, who posted a final-round 73, overcame a poor start and played the back 
nine at PGA National in one under par. He earned $72,000 for his fourth victory 
since joining the Senior tour in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Mowry finished with a 72-hole total of seven-under-par 281 on the 6,530-yard 
Champion course. Geiberger and Barber, who shot 71s Sunday, were tied at 282. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Sauers chipped in for birdie on the final hole to win the 
weather-shortened Hawaiian Open golf tournament at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Sauers took the lead with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole, then finished 
off a final-round 65 by chipping in from just off the back fringe of the green 
for the second victory in his six-year PGA career. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the rain-abbreviated 54-hole event in 19-under-par 197, the best 
three-round score on the tour this season. The tournament was shortened because 
of heavy rains that disrupted play Friday and Saturday.

SAN ANTONIO HANDICAP; 
</P>
<P>
PINCAY RIDES SUPER DIAMOND TO VICTORY

Two veteran horses ran first and last in the $272,100 San Antonio Handicap at 
Santa Anita on Sunday, with Super Diamond scoring a 1 3/4-length victory while 
Cutlass Reality, the favorite, trailed in the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, a 9-year-old gelding with a history of leg problems, shook off 
Cutlass Reality at the top of the stretch and held off Frankly Perfect through 
the stretch to give jockey Laffit Pincay his 10th victory of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlass Reality, a 7-year-old, went off at 23-10, slightly shorter than the 
entry of Frankly Perfect and Payant. It was Cutlass Reality's first start since 
he won the Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The race before that, the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs in November, 
Cutlass Reality ran poorly on a muddy track. His handlers considered scratching 
him Sunday because the track, hard hit by rain last week, was listed as good. 
Cutlass Reality faded from contention with a quarter mile to go and finished 
about 10 lengths behind Super Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Super Diamond, expected to run next in the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap on 
March 5, paid $13 to win as the fourth betting choice in a crowd of 38,601, 
running 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4/5. He is the oldest winner of the 51-year-old San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect finished second, two lengths ahead of Cherokee Colony. 
</P>
<P>
The winner carried 121 pounds, five more than Frankly Perfect and one more than 
Cherokee Colony. Cutlass Reality carried 124.

KYOKO INA, JAPAN'S JUNIOR CHAMPION IN 1987, TAKES U.S. JUNIOR GIRLS' TITLE

<P>
It was Japanese-American week at the U.S. figure skating championships. After 
Kristi Yamaguchi finished second in the women's individual competition and 
first in pairs on the senior level, Kyoko Ina won the junior girls' 
championship Sunday at the Baltimore Arena. 
</P>
<P>
That gives Ina, 16, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., junior championships in two 
hemispheres. She was Japan's junior champion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But after she finished fourth in juniors the next year in Japan, officials 
there advised her that she might have an easier time in the United States. At 
the 1988 world junior championships, Japanese skaters finished second and third 
behind Yamaguchi. In the 1989 championships, a Japanese skater finished second 
to Jessica Mills, who trains in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
Ina said Sunday that she would rather compete in the United States. The 
daughter of a Japanese costume jewelry manufacturer who is in the import-export 
business in New York, Ina was born in Tokyo and has dual citizenship. But she 
has lived in the United States since she was 6 months old. 
</P>
<P>
The reason she competed in Japan in the first place was because her mother, a 
former member of the Japanese national swimming team, encouraged her. Her 
grandfather was an Olympian in track and field for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like an outsider when I went back to Japan," said Ina, who speaks only 
a few words of Japanese. "They brushed me off." 
</P>
<P>
Ina won the championship Sunday over a pair of 14-year-olds, runner-up Mills 
and third-place Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks. All three earned berths in the 
1990 world junior championships at Colorado Springs, Colo.

Warren Luhrs brought his 60-foot sloop, Thursday's Child, under the Golden Gate 
Bridge and into history Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A cannon fired from the St. Francis Yacht Club to mark the end of an 80-day 
20-hour voyage from New York around Cape Horn. The time beat by 8 days 12 hours 
the clipper ship Flying Cloud's 1854 passage at the height of the Gold Rush. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Cloud's time of 89 days 8 hours had stood in the record book for 135 
years. Some contemporary clippers came close to the mark, but no modern 
sailboat did until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Luhrs, 44, and his crew, Lars Bergstrom, 54, and Courtney Hazelton, 32, arrived 
nine miles outside the Gate at 6 a.m., rolling in glassy seas and no wind. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the first of a flotilla of boats started through the Gate to meet 
the high-tech sloop. The wind began to fill from the northwest, and Thursday's 
Child hoisted a blue-and-white spinnaker and headed for the bridge in brilliant 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty boats formed a convoy, with a Coast Guard cutter leading the way. Three 
other Coast Guard boats kept the gathering pleasure craft clear as the sloop 
closed in on San Francisco Bay and the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Thursday's Child reached the Golden Gate, the Coast Guard was 
hard-pressed to keep the huge spectator fleet out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
The headlands north and south of the Gate were crowded with cars and 
pedestrians, as was the walkway on the bridge itself. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Child dropped its spinnaker just as it nosed under the bridge, and 
every horn in the fleet sounded. The bridge's spectators waved, and a fire boat 
sent geysers into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The passage under the bridge was jammed with boats, with scores more ready to 
join the parade inside the bay. 
</P>
<P>
When the sloop came abeam of the St. Francis Yacht Club, the finishing cannon 
sounded, and the race against history was won. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later at a news conference, Luhrs and his crew accepted medals from the 
city, a trophy from the Manhattan (N.Y.) Yacht Club and more medals from a 
sailing magazine. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Thursday's Child has a good chance of holding its record, at 
least for a while, although Luhrs said, "records are made to be broken." 
</P>
<P>
He added that with better wind conditions than he had, he thought the voyage 
could be made in 70 days. 
</P>
<P>
Luhrs' nearest challenger is solo sailor Philippe Monnet, 28, on the 60-foot 
trimaran Elle &amp; Vire, which left New York Jan. 8. Luhrs left Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Monnet reached Cape Horn last week, 14 days ahead of Flying Cloud's pace and a 
week ahead of Luhrs' pace. Then Saturday, just past the Horn, Monnet hit an 
iceberg that damaged one of the boat's hulls. 
</P>
<P>
Turning back for the Falkland Islands, he radioed for fiberglass material to be 
sent there for his repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Bernardin, 44, aboard BNP Bank of the West, is already out of the running, 
a victim for the second time of the fearsome Cape Horn. Bernardin was reported 
being towed by the Chilean Navy to Punta Arenas in Tierra del Fuego with 
loosened keel boats that were allowing water into the hull. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardin lost a 60-footer less than a year ago when he was dismasted in a gale 
and the boat holed off the cape. That time, too, the Chilean Navy came to the 
rescue. 
</P>
<P>
A third boat, a 50-foot trimaran, skippered by the only woman in the race, Anne 
Liardet, 27, Sunday was reported making her approach to Cape Horn. She is a day 
or two ahead of Flying Cloud's pace but well behind Thursday's Child's pace. 
Her crew is Joseph Le Quen, 41. 
</P>
<P>
Luhrs said the race was harder than expected most of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"We had gales right after leaving New York on Thanksgiving Day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he set a sailing record from New York to the Equator and another 
from New York to Cape Horn. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of damage," Luhrs said. "Finally, the boat struck something in 
the ocean that damaged the hull and broke a frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I was discouraged. But Lars Bergstrom said, 'Fine, we'll go to the Falklands 
and fix it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Luhrs heaped praise on the British air and naval forces in the Falklands. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the lengths they went to get us ready for sea again," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They helicoptered around the islands and went door to door to find a gallon of 
resin (a bonding agent) for us." 
</P>
<P>
The worst part of the voyage for Luhrs: "Missing my family and my two little 
girls, one of whom learned to walk while I was gone." 
</P>
<P>
Worst scare: "A gybe the second day out. The main boom slammed over to the 
other side of the boat and the main sheet (line) lapped around Courtney's neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I still get chills thinking about it. I screamed. There was nothing else I 
could do. Courtney flipped the line off his neck just as the boom snapped the 
sheet taut. It would have killed him instantly." 
</P>
<P>
What did he think of Sunday's reception? 
</P>
<P>
"I was awed," Luhrs said. "We don't do these things for the glory. We do them 
because we want to, but the reception was overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
Added Luhrs: "It is not often that any of us has the opportunity to play a role 
in history. We've had that opportunity."

PENGUINS CAN'T STOP FLAMES, WHO WIN 7TH IN A ROW

<P>
The Calgary Flames convinced themselves about a month ago that they were the 
best team in the National Hockey League. Now they are proving it to the rest of 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames overwhelmed the Pittsburgh Penguins with 50 shots Sunday night and 
skated to an easy 4-2 victory at Pittsburgh. The Flames are unbeaten in their 
last 11 games and have won 10 of them, the last seven in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gilmour scored twice as the Flames dominated the leaders of the Patrick 
Division, holding them to 17 shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Only the brilliance of Mario Lemieux allowed the Penguins to avert a 
humiliating defeat. After Joe Mullen, with an assist from Gilmour, gave Calgary 
an early lead, Lemieux set up Dave Hannan for the tying goal with just 1:29 
left in the first period. Hannan scored on the Penguins' second shot of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, Lemieux scored his ninth short-handed goal and his 58th 
of the season, but Gilmour soon restored the two-goal lead. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 3, New York Rangers 1 -- In one of their more impressive performances 
since the departure of Wayne Gretzky, the Oilers prevented the Rangers from 
taking over first place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
But it may have been a costly victory. Two of the Oilers' best players, Mark 
Messier and Jari Kurri, injured their knees in collisions with the same Ranger, 
defenseman Michel Petit. 
</P>
<P>
Messier banged into Petit in the first period, returned for two shifts in the 
second, then sat on the bench the rest of the game. Kurri had to be helped off 
the ice in the second period. Preliminary examinations did not reveal serious 
problems for either player. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Simpson scored the tie-breaking goal at 13:25 of the second period, and 
goalie Bill Ranford, who stopped 36 shots, made the lead stand up. The Rangers 
have won only one of their last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Philadelphia 2 -- At the All-Star break, it appeared that the 
Flyers were in a good position to challenge for first place in the Patrick 
Division. The Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Rangers seemed to be slipping, 
and Flyer goaltender Ron Hextall was rounding into form. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Flyers are headed the other way. This loss to the lowly Canucks at 
Philadelphia was their third in a row. The other losses were at Toronto and at 
home against Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks scored all three goals in the second period off Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 5, St. Louis 2 -- Ray Sheppard and Mike Foligno each scored twice at 
Buffalo as the Sabres ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres scored four of their goals right after the Blues failed to clear the 
puck after goalie Greg Millen made saves. DAN HAFNER

SADDLEBACK, MATER DEI ARE TOP-SEEDED TEAMS

<P>
Saddleback (24-1), the Sea View League champion, and Mater Dei (23-2), the 
Angelus League titlist, are the No. 1- and 2-seeded teams in the Southern 
Section Boys 5-AA Division basketball playoff pairings released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback has defeated Mater Dei twice this season. Loyola (20-2), the Del Rey 
League champion, is seeded third, and Lakewood, the Moore League titlist, is 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
First-round action begins Wednesday with the finals in all nine divisions 
scheduled for the week of Feb. 26-March 4. 
</P>
<P>
In the newly-adopted playoff format for the Southern Section, the first three 
teams in each league automatically qualified for the playoffs and were placed 
in divisions according to their size. 
</P>
<P>
Division 5-AA is for schools with an enrollment of at least 2,400; 5-A 
(2,000-2,399); 4-AA (1,750-1,999); 4-A (1,500-1,749); 3-A (1,000-1,499); 2-AA 
(750-999); 2-A (400-749); 1-A (150-399), and Small Schools (0-149). 
</P>
<P>
In addition, each league could submit other teams for playoff consideration, 
providing the teams had overall winning records. All at-large teams that were 
submitted for consideration were accepted, except in the 3-A, where the 32-team 
bracket was completely filled with automatic qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Schools were also allowed to move up one or more divisions if they gave notice 
before Jan. 9. Several schools, including Mater Dei, which went from 5-A to 
5-AA, and St. Paul, which went from 3-A to 4-A, took advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Here are remaining seeded teams, by division: 
</P>
<P>
5-A: 1. Pasadena (Pacific League No. 1); 2. Capistrano Valley (South Coast No. 
1); 3. Buena (Channel No. 2); 4. Irvine (South Coast No. 2).

No. 1). 
</P>
<P>
SMALL SCHOOLS: 1. Hesperia Christian (Christian No. 1); 2. Pilgrim (Heritage 
No. 1); 3. Grace Community Christian (Westside No. 1); 4. Cal Lutheran (Academy 
No. 1). 
</P>
<P>
The Moore League was the biggest benificiary of the new policy to allow more 
than three teams from any one league into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lakewood (20-6), Millikan (20-6) and Long Beach Jordan, the 
1-2-3 finishers in the league, Long Beach Poly (15-11), Long Beach Wilson 
(15-12) and Compton (13-11) advanced as at-large entrants. All of the school 
but Compton, which is 4-A, are in the 5-AA division. 
</P>
<P>
Four leagues, the Bay, Marmonte, Sea View and Whitmont, had five teams qualify. 
</P>
<P>
With only Saddleback and Mater Dei receiving byes in the 5-AA divsion, there 
are several interesting first-round matchups scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Wilson is at St. Bernard (21-5), the Camino Real League champion, 
Long Beach Poly is at Lynwood (15-9), the San Gabriel Valley League runnerup, 
Leuzinger (15-11), an at-large entrants from the Bay League, is at Millikan and 
Long Beach Jordan is at Antelope Valley (16-8), the Golden League co-champion. 
</P>
<P>
Other first-round games of interest, in the 5-A, Beverly Hills (14-9) at Arroyo 
Grande (16-7); in the 4-AA, Servite (12-10) at Torrance (14-10); in the 4-A, 
West Torrance (12-12) at Bishop Amat (14-9); in the 3-A, Corona del Mar (15-9) 
at El Dorado (20-4), Western (16-6) at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (16-8),

(19-4); in the 2-A, Santa Maria St. Joseph (12-11) at Paraclete (20-2); and in 
the 1-A, Mary Star (16-7) at Brentwood (14-8). 
</P>
<P>
The only one of the nine playoff divisions that has a completely filled bracket 
is the 3-A. In that division there were 33 automatic qualifiers which 
necessitated a wild-card game to reduce the field to 32 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Norte Vista (13-10), the third-place team in the Mountain View League, travels 
to Yucaipa (9-14), the third-place team from the Sunkist League, tonight, with 
the winner playing at South Hills (19-5), Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts (21-0), the defending state Division I champion and the only 
undefeated team in the City, is the top-seeded team in the boys' basketball 4-A 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
North Valley League champion Cleveland (20-2) is seeded second, followed by 
Crenshaw (17-2), the Southern League winner, and Carson (14-7), the Pacific 
League champion. 
</P>
<P>
Two coin flips on Tuesday will be necessary to finalize the pairings. Granada 
Hills (13-8) and Kennedy (12-8) are tied for third in the North Valley League 
and Palisades (9-11) and Fairfax (11-11) are tied for third in the Metro 
League. All first-round games are Friday. The City finals for both boys and 
girls in the 4-A and 3-A division are scheduled March 3 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester (15-5), which lost twice to Manual Arts in Metro League play but 
has lost to no other City team, was unseeded and will play host to Banning 
(10-13). 
</P>
<P>
The Comets could play Crenshaw in the quarterfinals and Cleveland in the 
semifinals before a possible rematch against Manual Arts in the City final. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A division, Fremont (22-3) of the Central League is seeded No. 1 and 
either Los Angeles (14-8) or University (15-6), which tied for the Western 
League title, will be seeded No. 2. Wilson (17-5), the North East Valley 
champion is seeded third and North Hollywood (15-4), the Mid Valley League 
titlist, is seeded fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Three leagues, Eastern, Northwest and Northeast, play their final games 
Tuesday. Poly and Birmingham will have a playoff game, Wednesday at a neutral 
site to determine second place in the Valley East League.

BRUSSELS: A CAPITAL CASE OF EURO-ITIS

<P>
On the train coming into Brussels, a pleasant tape-recorded voice welcomes 
passengers to the "Eurocapital." 
</P>
<P>
Bureaucrats here are Eurocrats. But there are also Euro-consultants, 
Euro-hair-stylists, Euro-schools and even a Euro-piano store. One shop not far 
from the European Commission headquarters sells Euro-gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 120 different items," boasted Euro-Tempo Boutique owner Nicole du 
Jacquiere, "including ties, umbrellas, bath towels, badges, key rings and 
leather goods. Our best sellers are the jogging outfits with the European 
colors (blue and gold) and emblems (a circle of 12 stars)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Superstate in 4 Years 
</P>
<P>
The 12 members of the European Community -- France, West Germany, Italy, 
Britain, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg 
and Denmark -- have pledged to open their common borders and form a potentially 
powerful superstate of 300 million people in four years. 
</P>
<P>
As the deadline of Dec. 31, 1992, for this new Europe approaches, the city of 
Brussels has come down with a capital case of Euro-itis. On one level, at 
least, the boosterism is well-founded. If the 12 member states realize their 
dream to become the "United States of Europe," one of the main beneficiaries 
will be this soot-gray city of 1 million in the historic battleground of 
Europe, not far from Waterloo and Flanders Field. 
</P>
<P>
As headquarters of the European Commission, home for most of the 12,000 
commission bureaucrats and principal meeting place for various European 
councils and committees, Brussels seems destined to be the Washington, D.C., of 
this increasingly important federation of European states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parliament Sessions Here 
</P>
<P>
The city was given another boost recently when the European Parliament, a body 
of elected representatives from the member states that is steadily gaining 
power under the 1992 format, voted to hold some of its sessions here instead of 
in Strasbourg, France, where the main Parliament building is located. 
</P>
<P>
The motion by a British representative called for only "supplementary sessions" 
to be held in Brussels. However, many observers, including outraged French 
delegates, interpreted the vote as the first step in the eventual relocation of 
the Parliament to the Belgian city. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 10 years, 80% of national economic and perhaps social decisions will be 
taken in Brussels," European Commission President Jacques Delors predicted 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
But the heady role cast for this city by the choreographers of the new Europe 
also has produced a healthy amount of skepticism among the Bruxellois -- the 
native inhabitants of this odd, French-speaking city, who often think of 
themselves as stateless orphans in their own country -- and among the various 
international representatives who live and work here. 
</P>
<P>
Euro-talk is cheap, they say, but can this frumpish, conservative trading town 
rise above its limitations to shine as a world capital? Can a town where the 
most famous monument is a statue of a little boy urinating in a fountain -- the 
manneken-pis -- emulate the triumphant grandeur of Paris and London and Rome? 
</P>
<P>
Can a place where hostilities between French- and Flemish-speaking populations 
have often erupted into violence and where huge North African and Turkish 
minorities live in poverty become the standard of an ethnically integrated 
Europe? 
</P>
<P>
Can a political hodgepodge with 19 police chiefs and a debt of more than $1 
billion lead the way to a new European prosperity? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Soulless City' 
</P>
<P>
"The only way it could possibly work is if it could be sold off to the 12 
nations," said Eric Rajendra, an American economist who acts as a corporate 
adviser on European questions in Paris and Brussels. "Otherwise, it will always 
be a soulless city with potholes and lousy city services." 
</P>
<P>
It could work, countered sociologist Rene Schoonbrodt, leader of the activist 
Urban Research and Action Workshop here, "if we could move the site of the 
capital outside the center of the city and create there a European quarter that 
reflected European cultural values." 
</P>
<P>
"As it is," Schoonbrodt said, "we have big problems trying to welcome any 
expansion in the European Community. This is a small city of little houses 
where life is very fragile and threatened by the big office buildings and the 
thousands of functionaries. There are already days in Brussels when there is 
not a single place to hold a meeting because all the meeting places are booked. 
It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
According to Schoonbrodt and other urban scholars here, the city is only now 
recovering from urban renewal projects begun here just before the 1958 World's 
Fair, when a phenomenal network of freeways was carved through the city and 
surrounding countryside. By the time American astronauts got to the moon in 
1969, only two man-made objects were visible to them from the lunar surface: 
the Great Wall of China and the brightly lit Belgian highway system. 
</P>
<P>
More development followed in the 1960s after the European Commission installed 
its headquarters here and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, ordered out 
of France by Charles de Gaulle, moved here in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worse than Houston' 
</P>
<P>
The result was massive overbuilding of modern office space, some of its cheek 
by jowl with medieval churches, and the destruction of entire neighborhoods. 
"It was a city without a plan -- worse than Houston, Texas," Schoonbrodt said. 
</P>
<P>
Pockets of the original culture remained, however. Most of the city's major 
tourist sites were left intact, including the ornate 15th-Century central 
square, the royal palace, the manneken-pis -- which residents occasionally 
dress up in costumes ranging from a scuba diving suit to an American Army 
sergeant's uniform -- and the huge 19th-Century Hall of Justice, a bizarre 
combination of Roman and Egyptian architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime residents say the city's virtues can be found in the small quirks of 
daily life such as its colorful local dialects; its rich, abundant food 
("French food with German quantity," purred one plump American diplomat based 
here), and its marvelous beers, some of which are brewed by Trappist monks. 
</P>
<P>
But in his classic novel, "Heart of Darkness," author Joseph Conrad described 
Brussels as a "sepulchral" city, gray and melancholy like the grave. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the down side, city finances are a shambles. Metropolitan Brussels is 
divided into 19 political units called communes. The central commune of 
Brussels proper has a population of 140,000 residents and a deficit of nearly 
$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
French-Speaking Town 
</P>
<P>
Also, because Brussels is a French-speaking town in a Flemish-speaking area of 
Belgium, it is unloved, and therefore mostly unfunded, by the rest of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Brussels is a city that hardly knows what it is," said John Palmer, a British 
journalist and author who has lived many years in the Belgian capital. "It is 
an island of Francophonism because its Flemish feudal leaders spoke French. But 
its original inhabitants were mostly Flemish peasants who are still mistrusted 
by the French-speaking Walloon population of the south. Meanwhile, they are 
considered Uncle Toms by the Flemish speakers of the north." 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's subway system is among the best in Europe, the rest of city 
services suffer. Municipal emergency and police services are overtaxed because 
nearly one-fourth of the city population is composed of illegal immigrants, 
mostly from North Africa and Turkey, who live in areas of high crime and high 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Native Bruxellois refer derisively to the ghettos as "Little Marrakesh" and 
"Little Istanbul." Meanwhile, many Arab immigrants say they dream of someday 
returning to North Africa, where they can be free from the prejudices and 
intolerance of life here. Indeed, the bitterness here may be more intense than 
in the industrial cities of France. 
</P>
<P>
Whether these unwanted, unhappy aspects of Brussels detract from the image of 
one of the world's great new capitals remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent District 
</P>
<P>
Belgian officials are hoping that a vote in the Brussels area June 18 will 
solve many of the capital's problems. Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, as part 
of his reforms aimed at solving Belgium's chronic language wars, has introduced 
a federal plan for his country, in which Brussels will become an independent 
district ruled by a council formed from the 19 communes. 
</P>
<P>
"It will put the whole metropolitan area under one authority," said Anne-Marie 
Lizin, a Belgian Cabinet minister who has been designated minister for 1992 
under Martens. "We think it will solve our biggest problems." The Belgian 
government, meanwhile, has pledged to pay nearly all of the Brussels debt. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest advantage of Brussels and Belgium, Lizin said, is that the people 
have never been very patriotic. Historically, Belgium is a young and 
artificially created independent state that came into existance in the mid-19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear it is easier for us to be a citizen of the new country of Europe 
than it is for a Frenchman, for example," Lizin said. "We have little or no 
sense of nationalism, and the constant fighting between the Flemish and the 
Walloons has actually helped us in this regard." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a surprising number of Bruxellois think of themselves as stateless 
beings, eagerly awaiting the arrival of their new country: Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Great Crossroads' 
</P>
<P>
Said Alain de Clerck, the 46-year-old owner of a sporting goods store in 
Brussels: 
</P>
<P>
"I think of myself as European, never Belgian. To be Bruxellois means to live 
in a city in the center of Europe that is a great crossroads. It is to belong 
to three or four cultures at the same time. One part of my family is Flemish, 
another part Walloon and another part French. As a result, I don't have much 
nationalistic sentiment." 
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate their new nationality, these Europeople have taken to flying the 
blue-and-gold European flag from their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
An equally ubiquitous symbol of the new order seems to be the bumper stickers 
from Nicole du Jacquiere's boutique, judging from the cars parked around the 
European Commission headquarters. Each car owner, the stylish blue-and-gold 
stickers proudly announce, is a "Citizen of Europe."

SOVIETS DEBATE LESSONS OF FAILED AFGHAN POLICY

As the last few thousand Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan, they are returning 
to a warm welcome from a relieved nation happy to have them home, but also to a 
growing political controversy over the nine-year war. 
</P>
<P>
"Our boys are coming home," a Soviet television commentator said over the 
weekend, summing up the universal satisfaction both at the troops' return and 
at the knowledge that by Wednesday, the country will finally be out of an 
unwinnable and increasingly unpopular war. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Motherland!" the government newspaper Izvestia said in a headline over 
one of its front-page reports on the withdrawal last week. "We've Waited for 
This for Nine Years," another front-page headline declared. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening, Soviet Television shows more tanks, armored personnel carriers 
and trucks full of troops crossing the border from Afghanistan into Soviet 
Central Asia. Their clear joy is infectious as the cameras focus on the 
long-awaited family reunions and then on the on-the-spot demobilization of many 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
And, like his troops, Lt. Gen. Boris Gromov -- the Soviet commander in 
Afghanistan -- will cross Friendship Bridge linking the Soviet town of Termez 
with Hayratan on the Afghan side "without looking back," a correspondent for 
the Soviet youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda reported. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to be the last Soviet soldier to leave Afghanistan on Wednesday, the 
deadline for completion of the withdrawal of the 100,300 troops who were there 
when the pullout began nine months ago, Gromov will pause only for a minute or 
so to reflect on the long war, the paper said, and then he, too, "will have 
returned to the warm embrace of the motherland." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are few emotions deeper than the joy of a homecoming for a 
Russian, the Soviet troops are returning to a growing and increasingly bitter 
political debate over whose mistake it was to invade Afghanistan in late 1979 
and then to stay nine years, fighting on behalf of a government now perceived 
as largely without popular support. 
</P>
<P>
One of "our old sins," President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called it during a speech 
here last month -- only to change the characterization two days later, when his 
remarks were published, to a criticism of the "considerable expenditures" 
involved in the war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearly 15,000 Killed 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 15,000 Soviet personnel reported killed, huge resources wasted and 
the country's international prestige badly damaged in the war, this political 
sensitivity stems first from the question of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The late President Leonid I. Brezhnev is officially being blamed for this and 
most of the country's other political, economic and social ills. But with its 
principle of collective leadership, the Communist Party, which repeatedly 
endorsed the Afghanistan action as in the finest traditions of the 
international Communist movement, is being pressed now to acknowledge the war 
fully and formally as a fundamental error. 
</P>
<P>
As party members seek election next month to the new Congress of People's 
Deputies, Afghanistan is an issue on which they are frequently challenged as 
they assert the correctness of perestroika, the political, economic and social 
restructuring begun by Gorbachev in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Why has it taken nearly four years under Gorbachev, under perestroika, to 
complete our withdrawal?" a trade union delegate demanded of a party official 
during a nomination meeting here last week. "Even now, with almost all of our 
boys back home, why can't you say we were wrong to go in? Why do you still say 
it was our 'internationalist duty' to defend a government and a party that were 
never socialist and came to power through a coup d'etat?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cracks Are Showing 
</P>
<P>
The party is still grappling with such questions itself, and, amid the 
continuing political ferment here, the divisions are increasingly apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it has taken nearly 10 years," Alexander Bovin, a leading 
Soviet commentator, said recently of the decision to withdraw. "It took 
thousands of deaths, enormous materials costs, a fall in our country's prestige 
and the exacerbation of the international atmosphere to understand -- to 
understand not in theory, but in practice -- that every people has to decide 
its own fate itself, without outside interference. 
</P>
<P>
"This conclusion is drawn not because we proved powerless to change the natural 
course of events in another country. This conclusion is drawn because the very 
attempt to change that course of events was mistaken in principle." 
</P>
<P>
Bovin, whose sharp criticism has been cut several times from television 
commentaries, acknowledged that many, particularly those who fought in 
Afghanistan, find it difficult to accept this view, which contradicts past 
ideals of "internationalist duty" and "fraternal assistance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Truth 
</P>
<P>
"The bitter truth is all the same better and more useful than an 'elevating 
deception,' " he remarked, adding that blame did not lie with "the officers and 
men who fought in Afghanistan and were true to their oath and fulfilled their 
soldierly duty" but with those who made the political decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan war was never popular, but it was not the central and highly 
emotional issue here that the Vietnam War became in American politics. The 
Soviet political system permitted little debate until recently, and the scale 
of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan was only one-fifth that of the United 
States in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting aside the differences we see in the origins of U.S. intervention in 
Vietnam and our involvement in Afghanistan -- and we think they are quite 
significant differences, starting with the fact that Afghanistan was a 
neighboring country with a socialist government -- the war was kept remote from 
our people," a senior Soviet editor commented last week, asking not to be 
quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
"The commitment of our forces was much, much less than those the U.S. deployed 
in Vietnam, our casualties were kept secret, the costs of the war were never 
disclosed and our press always treated the Afghan conflict in heroic terms as 
part of our internationalist duty as Communists." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a survey of 1,000 Muscovites in December showed that 61% of the 
respondents thought the decision to send troops into Afghanistan was wrong; 22% 
believed that it was correct. 
</P>
<P>
With glasnost, the opening of political discussion that came as an important 
part of Gorbachev's broader reforms, the Soviet news media began in late 1987 
to give a more accurate picture of what the Afghan war was like -- both its 
failure to achieve the stated goal of a flourishing socialist state and what 
the Soviet soldiers sent there on 18-month tours were going through in a 
particularly cruel conflict. 
</P>
<P>
"For years and years, we had a war in which our soldiers never died and rarely 
even bled," Leonid Mironov, who covered the start of the war for the Communist 
Party newspaper Pravda, commented during a discussion on the war here this 
month. "It must have seemed like a war without casualties, without costs . . . 
a war that we could only win and in which we had only heroes. Maybe that is one 
reason why it went on for so long." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Geneva Accords 
</P>
<P>
Only when the decision was made last year to pull out under an agreement signed 
April 15 in Geneva by Afghanistan and Pakistan -- with the United States and 
the Soviet Union as guarantors -- did it become possible to question why Moscow 
had intervened in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Mironov, who believes strongly that the war was "wrong from the beginning," 
speculated that the Soviet leadership -- the party and the military alike -- 
wanted to show the West, particularly the United States, the Red Army's combat 
ability and Moscow's determination to advance socialism in developing 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
But Maj. Gen. Lev Serebrov, another of the top Soviet commanders in 
Afghanistan, replied: "Yes, we made mistakes! But everything we did there, and 
I stress that everything we did, was for the sake of the Afghan people!" 
</P>
<P>
Serebrov, who was in Afghanistan for the first three years of the war and then 
returned about a year ago for a final tour, also said he could not quarrel with 
the Soviet leadership's initial decision to intervene. History would have to 
judge the correctness of their action, he said, adding, "We are still too close 
to events." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the bitter debate in the United States over the Vietnam War, which 
continued undiminished long after the protests erupted, the importance of this 
tough political give and take lies in its implications for perestroika, for 
fundamental change in the Soviet Union, and not for Afghanistan's future. 
</P>
<P>
"We all -- the party and the people -- need a stern, hard, man-to-man talk 
about the lessons of Afghanistan," Bovin said in a December television 
commentary that was censored but later published in the highly influential, 
mass circulation political weekly Arguments and Facts. "We need the truth. I 
would like to hear the opinions and assessments of the main figures -- 
high-ranking party officials, the military, the diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past -- I mean the conflict with Yugoslavia in 1948, the events in 
Hungary in 1956 and the troops sent into Czechoslovakia in 1968 -- we were too 
lenient with ourselves. Nowadays, in the years of perestroika, we cannot permit 
this. The mistakes for which we are paying in blood, in the prestige of the 
party and socialism and with the people's money, must not be repeated." The 
eventual judgment will inevitably reflect the outcome of events in Afghanistan 
over the next few months -- and Soviet officials seem neither optimistic nor 
too concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the present situation, the government newspaper Izvestia suggested 
Sunday that hundreds of thousands of people could die as the civil war 
intensifies. 
</P>
<P>
"Afghans of opposing political persuasions have been left confronting each 
other," the paper said, adding that the moujahedeen, the Muslim rebels who 
oppose the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, are "thirsting for blood." 
</P>
<P>
"The future holds the prospects of tens and even hundreds of thousands of 
deaths, which could have been avoided by the show of the most elementary good 
will and political reason," Izvestia said, lamenting the failure of final 
Soviet diplomatic efforts to pull together a political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet advisers are no more optimistic. Although Gromov said last week that 
Afghan government forces had all of the arms, equipment, ammunition and other 
supplies they need to fight off the expected moujahedeen attacks and then go on 
the offensive themselves, many majors and captains doubt the Afghans' ability 
to use the equipment and, more importantly, their will to fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equipment Left Behind 
</P>
<P>
"We have left fine equipment, but they will have enormous problems using it, 
maintaining it, repairing it, even firing it," a Soviet army major said in an 
interview over Radio Moscow this weekend. "They have no experience, they have a 
poor base of skills and knowledge and they have very low morale." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials are now reassuring the country, as well as outsiders, that 
after Wednesday their troops will be out of Afghanistan, not to return. 
</P>
<P>
While Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze warned that Moscow will continue 
to supply arms and other materiel to the Kabul government if the fighting 
continues, Soviet spokesmen have repeatedly declared that there will be no 
further military support, such as air strikes, to help the government forces. 
</P>
<P>
The supply of food, medicine and other essentials will continue. Up to 40 large 
Soviet cargo planes are transporting nearly 700 tons of supplies to Kabul each 
day in an airlift from Tashkent in Soviet Central Asia. Air drops are beginning 
to other towns. And final repairs are being made on the pipelines that carry 
fuel from the Soviet border to Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
But fewer than 6,000 troops now remain, according to a Radio Moscow broadcast 
on Sunday, and most of those are on the way out by convoy. The last major 
contingent to leave -- aside from an embassy of 200 people and several hundred 
officers advising the Afghan army -- will be the 500 soldiers guarding Kabul 
airport and the column led by Gen. Gromov. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they can last six months," a Soviet military journalist said of the 
Afghan government forces after returning last week in one of the convoys. "Six 
months would not just be what Americans call a 'decent interval' before 
collapse, because if they last that long they might have a chance of getting a 
political settlement. . . . At this point, once we get our boys out, that is 
all we want, a political settlement that avoids a bloody finale."

MORE LATINO IMMIGRANTS SEEKING U.S. CITIZENSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Ignacio Mata has been a legal resident of the United States since 1955. He has 
raised a family in Los Angeles, sending three daughters to college. He pays 
taxes. But he has never voted. Officially still a Mexican national, he cannot 
cast a ballot in the country where he plans to spend the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by his daughter for years, Mata finally affixed his signature to an 
application for citizenship the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier (now), especially with all the help you have here," said the 
warehouse clerk, sitting in a crowded auditorium in East Los Angeles, where 
volunteers guided hundreds of aspiring citizens through the process. "In time, 
we're going to change the vote." 
</P>
<P>
Mata is one of thousands of Latinos who, after years of productive but marginal 
lives in the United States, have broken with tradition and decided to become 
citizens in their adopted country. 
</P>
<P>
Mexicans -- who despite being the largest immigrant group, historically have 
been among the least likely to naturalize -- are becoming citizens at twice the 
rate of a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are still an estimated 2 to 3 million Latinos in the United States 
eligible to become citizens, and that could double in the next several years. 
The federal amnesty program, which has commanded the attention of most Latino 
groups, is putting almost 3 million illegal aliens on the path toward becoming 
legal residents, making them eligible for eventual citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
But the crush of eager amnesty applicants, say naturalization advocates, has 
diverted resources from the large number of Latinos who could become citizens 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
While still falling far behind Asians and Europeans, Mexican naturalization 
shot up from 11,000 in 1982 to more than 23,000 in 1985 and a peak the next 
year of 28,000. Applicants leveled off in 1987, the same year that the amnesty 
program swung into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the numbers are a drop in the bucket: only one of three eligible Latinos 
generally applies for citizenship, compared to two-thirds of most other groups. 
</P>
<P>
A leading Latino organization, concerned that too few immigrants are 
participating in democracy, is expanding its campaign to increase these 
numbers. It is stepping in, its leaders say, partly because government efforts 
to encourage citizenship have been slack. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really the hidden obstacle to political empowerment in our community," 
said Harry Pachon, executive director of the National Assn. of Latino Elected 
and Appointed Officials. "(More than) 800,000 Latinos in Los Angeles County 
can't vote, serve on juries or work in the aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
The association recently began a workshop program where volunteers steer 
applicants through the often confusing path to citizenship. Next year it plans 
to expand its program throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Said City Councilman Richard Alatorre: "The entire landscape of L.A. could 
conceivably be changed." Alatorre said he constantly meets residents who are 
"extremely interested in their government" but shy away from taking the final 
step. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians, immigration officials and scholars say Latinos may well be on 
their way to overcoming their traditional fears of citizenship. Factors cited 
in the past for their reluctance include: discrimination and the feeling that 
America doesn't really accept them; fear of losing their identity; attachments 
to their country of origin (Mexico revokes citizenship when someone becomes 
naturalized elsewhere); and an oft-stated but seldom realized desire to move 
back home after making good money here. Another reason sometimes given is that 
the application is too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really surprising the number of people out there that are eligible for 
citizenship and for no good reason don't do it," said Michael Roquemore, a 
volunteer at the recent naturalization workshop. "They have not exercised their 
rights of citizenship (sometimes) for 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
The requirements are simple: five years of legal permanent residence, no 
felonies, English and civics tests and a $50 fee. 
</P>
<P>
Between 80,000 and 110,000 residents become citizens every year in the Los 
Angeles area, according to the INS. Over three days in April, the Convention 
Center will swell with more than 15,000 fledgling citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese and Filipinos are the most likely to become citizens, with about 
25,000 of each group doing so in 1987, the last year for which figures are 
available. Among Mexicans -- a much larger group -- only about 22,000 did so. 
</P>
<P>
Resident aliens are bound to all the duties of citizenship -- taxes, the draft 
-- but they are denied some of the rights. Most elective offices as well as 
many government jobs are off limits. So are jobs that require security 
clearances. This is an important factor in California, where one in five jobs 
is with the government or defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
But many residents live happily for decades without citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"There are really few inconveniences to not being a citizen," said Leo Estrada, 
a professor of urban planning at UCLA, who has researched naturalization 
patterns. "On the other hand, going through the process of citizenship is a 
considerable process." 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for that process is the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
sometimes derisively referred to as a "two-headed creature," the adjudicator of 
citizenship and, more frequently, the enforcer of immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
Because the INS devotes most of its resources to enforcement, it is often 
viewed negatively by immigrants. Government officials counter that 
naturalization is a voluntary act and one that they cannot afford to promote 
more heavily, given current fiscal constraints. 
</P>
<P>
While aliens are told when they can become permanent residents and refugees are 
reminded a year after admission to apply for such status, naturalization 
candidates are not identified as such. 
</P>
<P>
Pachon of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials says 
that the INS "has forgotten its middle initial." 
</P>
<P>
In January, a group representing more than 80 immigrant organizations met with 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to lobby for a bureau of citizenship that would 
actively promote naturalization. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Gustafson, director of the INS Los Angeles office, called the idea a 
bureaucratic "nightmare." He also defended the agency's handling of 
naturalization, citing the reduction of backlogs in citizenship applications 
from four years to about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The number of potential Latino voters could be given an additional boost in 
1993, when the first wave from amnesty is expected to break. The citizens' pool 
in 
</P>
<P>
California could expand by almost a million people. 
</P>
<P>
Under one option, amnesty applicants can complete the English and civics part 
of the citizenship test and naturalize as soon as they have been a permanent 
resident for five years. Gustafson estimates that as many as 75% of those 
receiving amnesty might apply for citizenship the first year they are eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Political activists, however, say translating numbers into political clout 
requires more than just boosting the naturalization rates: citizens must become 
registered voters, as well as go to the polls, and districts must be 
reapportioned. 
</P>
<P>
"When there's no meaningful opportunity for the Latino community to elect 
someone they want, they tend to drop out," said Richard P. Fajardo, a lawyer 
with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is suing 
Los Angeles County. "Fair representation starts with the Hispanic community 
getting districts they can get elected in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Districts Challenged 
</P>
<P>
MALDEF, along with the Justice Department, contends that the county has drawn 
supervisorial districts so as to undermine Latino electoral power, an 
allegation denied by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, studies show that naturalized voters turn out in better numbers 
than native-born citizens, according to Robert Brischetto, executive director 
of the Southwest Voter Research Institute in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to have that fervor and appreciation for what citizenship means," 
said Lupe de la Cruz, an aide to Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Los Angeles). "We've 
had a voice but lacked the muscle and mechanism to translate that into action." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, when the state's adult population was 17% Latino, voters in that 
November's election were 7% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"American democracy becomes less representative when this many people can't 
participate," said Rosalind Gold, a consultant who has studied citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Participation was not a problem at the first Assn. of Latino Elected and 
Appointed Officials workshop on a recent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 they queued up. Single men, teen-age couples, families, the elderly, 
workers and professionals. Most chatted in Spanish and waited patiently for 
more than two hours outside the East Los Angeles Service Center. They came to 
become ciudadanos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
250 Applicants 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 volunteers assisted them in completing the forms, as well as 
photographing and fingerprinting the applicants. The association will forward 
the more than 250 applications to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, almost two-thirds of the 368,664 applications nationwide were 
approved; only about 6,000 were turned down. The rest -- more than a third -- 
were refused on technical reasons, errors or omissions, said Karen Escalante of 
Latino officials association. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 workshops this year in Southern California, the association intends to 
help 10,000 people apply for naturalization, a prelude to its planned 
nationwide effort next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hortencia Vielme, a teacher's assistant in Los Angeles, made a New Year's 
resolution to seek citizenship after years of putting it off. 
</P>
<P>
"We love this country," she said. "We're not going to leave. (You don't) feel a 
part of this country (without citizenship)." 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Hector Organista came with his brother, sister and parents 
to apply for citizenship. For Organista, being a citizen will mean a better job 
in the Navy, in which he recently enlisted. He said his recruiter urged him to 
naturalize so that he can work in areas requiring a security clearence. 
</P>
<P>
It will also mean a fuller integration into society. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense in living in another country if you can't be a citizen," he 
said. "I'm going to turn 18 in a couple of months and I want to get my vote 
in."

GUATEMALA 'MODEL CITIES' PROVE MORE LIKE PRISONS

XEXUCAP, Guatemala 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This tiny hamlet in the remote mountains of Guatemala is to be a model city, 
government officials say, a place where people displaced by civil war can renew 
their lives with all the services and security the government can provide. 
</P>
<P>
But to many of the people who live here, Xexucap is a kind of prison. 
</P>
<P>
Xexucap, pronounced Shay-shu-cup in the language of the area's Ixil Indians, is 
the newest of half a dozen villages ordered built since 1983 to resettle 
peasants hiding in the mountains as a result of Guatemala's war with Marxist 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour's walk to the east, over the dirt path that connects Xexucap with 
the rest of the world, lies Acul, one of the oldest and most complete of the 
model cities. Acul appears to be an almost idyllic place -- neat rows of wooden 
houses with red-tile roofs laid out on an orderly grid halfway up the 
mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
There is electricity (even a couple of television sets) and community water 
taps within easy walking distance of every front door. Each house has its own 
garden, and the residents share the fruits of a fertile common growing area in 
the valley below. 
</P>
<P>
But this is no Happy Valley. Most of the families cannot afford to pay for the 
electricity, so they sit in the dark and too often drink the night away with 
moonshine that rots the mind and body. After dark, the streets are an obstacle 
course strewn with people passed out in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-like order of the place offends most of the 1,600 residents, Indians 
who for centuries lived far from their neighbors, free to farm their own small 
plots, free to let their pigs and chickens roam, free to come and go at will. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is possible in Acul or Xexucap, or in any of the other 
resettlement villages. These people -- now totaling 4,600 -- were brought in by 
force. They cannot live on their own land or leave the village without the 
permission of the head of a civil defense committee appointed by the army. 
Houses must be within a few yards of one another and livestock must be kept 
separate from the village. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid Seldom Delivered 
</P>
<P>
Worst of all, according to many residents, the promised government aid is 
seldom delivered. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no work, no money, and the people are hungry," an Acul resident said. 
He said his name is Juan, and like nearly all the people interviewed in the 
villages, he asked not to be fully identified. 
</P>
<P>
Another resident, Tomas, said that until 1982 he, his wife and their seven 
children lived on their own land, a boulder-strewn plot of less than an acre 
about 10 minutes' walk from Xexucap. They grew corn as a cash crop and raised 
chickens and pigs for their table. 
</P>
<P>
It was a severe existence, but for the Ixil Indians, who still wear the 
brightly colored clothing of their Mayan ancestors and follow the ancient 
customs, it was their way of life. 
</P>
<P>
For Tomas, the war became a reality when guerrillas began operating in the 
region and the army reacted. The army has a reputation for disregarding human 
rights, to the extent that the United States has refused to provide military 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Than 30 Killed 
</P>
<P>
One night, troops purportedly looking for guerrillas worked over the area from 
Acul to Xexucap, killing more than 30 people, including women and children, and 
destroying dozens of houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a controlled area," Tomas said, referring to the mountainous areas 
where the rebels held sway until the military, aided by helicopters armed with 
bombs and rockets, recently drove the rebels away and reduced their strength 
from 12,000 to about 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
Even though "there was nothing to eat," Tomas and his family stayed with the 
guerrillas until last February, when the rebels were forced to retreat and the 
army bombed the camp where Tomas was living. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials in Guatemala City say that people like Tomas were 
persuaded to leave the mountains voluntarily after the army assured them they 
would be safe and would be given health care, food, housing and job training. 
</P>
<P>
But Tomas said he left "because of the helicopters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Shelter 
</P>
<P>
He spoke softly, aware of the government agent with a rifle who had quietly 
edged up to the clearing in front of the hut Tomas had built from branches as a 
temporary shelter, until the government provides building materials. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us everything was all right," Tomas said, "but then they bombed us. 
They bombed us one day for four hours. It was very close, and we were afraid. 
Then they landed and took us out." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Tomas and his family were kept in a military camp near the town of 
Nebaj, where he was interrogated. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat there," he said, "with no work, no food, no clothing." 
</P>
<P>
This was followed by three months at a re-education camp called Xemamatze on 
the outskirts of Nebaj, a muddy place about the size of a football field within 
a horseshoe-shaped collection of dank, foul-smelling buildings with raw, 
Sheetrock walls that can accommodate about 600 people and a couple dozen 
heavily armed soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teaching Them a Trade 
</P>
<P>
The government says the purpose of Xemamatze is to re-educate the displaced 
people, to teach them a trade while restoring their health and, at the same 
time, instilling in them a sense of patriotism. In the beginning, there were as 
many as 300 people in the camp at any one time. Now there are about 70 at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The job training often ended up being work -- baking, weaving and repairing 
roads. When the Indians said they wanted to be paid for this labor, the 
government stopped the training programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no courses in education," Tomas said. "We asked for lessons, but 
there were only lessons on saluting the flag, lessons on the dangers of 
communism." 
</P>
<P>
With a smile that revealed his broken teeth and scurvy-shrunken gums, he said: 
"We learned the national anthem. It didn't bring any pay or food, but I know 
the national anthem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Told to Build a House 
</P>
<P>
Tomas said he was taken to Acul, without being asked, and told to walk to 
Xexucap and start building a house on a plot chosen by the army. He said he was 
told that building materials "would be brought to us." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials in Guatemala City said that wallboard and other materials 
will be sent in, but they had no idea when. 
</P>
<P>
If materials are sent in, it will be no easy task to get them to the building 
site. Because there is no road to Xexucap, the people will have to haul them on 
their backs from the end of the road at Acul. 
</P>
<P>
This is what happened at Janlay, a resettlement village on a site so steep that 
getting to it requires ropes. The people of Janlay hauled up cement foundation 
blocks and Sheetrock, one piece at a time. A road was built only after the 
village was completed and President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo was ready to come up 
for an inaugural ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Still uncompleted is a water-purifying plant and pump. The 1,200 residents are 
served by a single water tap. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Windows, Rotting Walls 
</P>
<P>
"Life is calm here," a man in Janlay said, "but the houses don't have windows 
and the walls rot. We should have wood but the government wouldn't give us 
any." 
</P>
<P>
Another complained that "we can't make enough money" from the corn and fruit 
they grow. To survive, the men in Janlay and the other villages work "on the 
coast," as they call the lowland plantations near the Pacific coast. And they 
have to get the authorities' permission to do so. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the coast takes as much as eight hours on foot and by bus. Pay on the 
plantations there is at best the equivalent of $2.40 a day. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a lack of work in the villages, but the army, which is in charge 
of all the resettlement villages, finds non-paying tasks for the men. Every 
male age 16 to 60 is forced to join the civil defense committee, even though 
Gen. Gonzalo Menendez, the government's human rights attorney general, said 
that "service is voluntary; it is unconstitutional to force anyone to join." 
</P>
<P>
Still, according to Tomas and others, they have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived in Acul," Tomas said, "the military commissioner told me I had 
to serve several days a month." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Form of Coercion 
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, the civil defense committees organize 
patrols to protect the villages from the guerrillas. But human rights officials 
say it is really a form of coercion and control, a way to compromise the people 
and make the rebels think they are government agents. 
</P>
<P>
At bottom, though, the village people say their principal problem is the lack 
of services. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a clinic," a man in Janlay said, "but there is no doctor, no medicine, 
no food, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
There are no teachers for Janlay's newly completed school, so the children are 
as illiterate as their parents. Instead of going to school, they work. Girls 
and boys alike, some as young as 4, make their way to Acul with bundles of 
firewood weighing 50 pounds or more, hoping to sell the wood for a bit of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
In all the villages of the area, there was general agreement with the 
sentiments expressed by Tomas, who said: 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here was not our idea. The army told us we were going to do it. Life 
was hard before, but it was our life. Now it isn't."

A proposed expansion of the FBI's nationwide computerized crime files to track 
suspects under investigation -- but not sought for arrest -- was attacked 
Sunday on civil liberties and technical grounds by a panel of computer 
scientists 
</P>
<P>
The expansion would convert the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) 
from a system based on information in the public record into "an unprecedented 
type of nationwide electronic surveillance," according to an advisory panel to 
the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
FBI Director William S. Sessions recently reached a decision on whether to go 
ahead with the controversial expansion, and his finding will be forwarded to 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh for "appropriate review," said Milton Ahlerich, the 
FBI's assistant director for congressional and public affairs. He declined to 
disclose Sessions' decision. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussed Vigorously 
</P>
<P>
However, Ahlerich said civil liberties and privacy concerns weighed "most 
heavily," along with operational concerns, in Sessions' decision. "It was given 
very vigorous discussion, and everyone weighed in on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the dispute is the NCIC, which was created in 1967 as a 
mechanism for the interstate exchange of criminal justice information and has 
grown from about 300,000 individual records to about 20 million records on 
wanted or missing persons, stolen property and criminal histories. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, the NCIC advisory policy board, made up of representatives 
of some of the 64,000 federal, state and local agencies that draw on the 
system, recommended to Sessions that it be used for tracking suspects in drug, 
murder and kidnaping cases for whom no arrest warrants had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Generate Notice 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed expansion, subjects of investigations would be listed on an 
NCIC index, and any subsequent query to the computer on such a person would 
generate a notice to the investigating agency, specifying the current location 
of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
The system includes a "silent hit" feature that is designed to help safeguard 
the privacy of individuals on the index. It would not tell an inquiring police 
officer that the subject of his inquiry is also under investigation for drug 
trafficking, murder or kidnaping. But the inquiry would give the agency that 
originally entered the subject in the NCIC tracking file the option of 
contacting the inquiring officer for further information. 
</P>
<P>
"However, even if the silent hit proposal is implemented, officers could learn 
of the existence of an investigation in another agency," said the report by 
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, which worked with the 
American Civil Liberties Union to assess the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"By entering a query on a particular individual, an officer would trigger a 
contact from the investigator who created the original record," the report 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Adding investigative files to the NCIC would dramatically change the system, 
said the report, which was requested by Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), chairman 
of the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raise Serious Issues 
</P>
<P>
"It would turn the NCIC from a public record system, which collects and 
disseminates information already available to the public, into a surveillance 
system," the report said. "Such files are not authorized by statute and raise 
serious constitutional issues." 
</P>
<P>
Potential benefits to law enforcement from the tracking files "appear to be 
limited," the report said. "Investigators may have difficulty locating the 
inquiring officer, and that officer may not remember the encounter with the 
subject (which may have been a routine traffic stop)." 
</P>
<P>
The NCIC advisory policy board, while recommending using the system to track 
persons under investigation in drug, murder or kidnaping cases, opposed using 
it for organized crime, arson, terrorism and foreign intelligence cases. No 
official could be reached to explain why the group excluded these categories, 
but it appeared to be trying to limit the scope of the system's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
But the report contended that approving of any tracking files would serve as a 
precedent for further expansion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes Public Concern 
</P>
<P>
"Proponents of new files will select areas of crime where there is widespread 
public concern," the report said. "The drug trafficking file was among the 
first to be proposed, precisely because of that concern. If another issue 
similarly captures the attention of the media and the public, there will be 
calls for a tracking file in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who forwarded a copy of the report to Sessions last week, is expected 
to hold subcommittee hearings on the expansion next month. 
</P>
<P>
Sections of the report were written by James J. Horning, Peter G. Neumann and 
David D. Redell, all computer scientists and members of Computer Professionals 
for Social Responsibility; Janlori Goldman, an attorney with the ACLU's project 
on privacy and technology, and Diana R. Gordon, a professor of political 
science at the City College of New York.

BAKER, GENSCHER CONFER ON MISSILES; 
</P>
<P>
'GOOD' MEETING HELD ON BONN PROPOSAL TO DELAY NEW WEAPON

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, seeking to defuse an issue that could 
disrupt NATO military strategy, met with West German Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher on Sunday to discuss a Bonn proposal to delay building a 
new short-range nuclear missile. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need to do is find out exactly what the position is -- what the German 
government position is going to be," Baker told reporters shortly before 
landing here on the fourth stop of a weeklong, 15-country tour of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. 
</P>
<P>
But after a two-hour dinner meeting with Genscher, a senior U.S. official 
traveling with Baker said only that the two "had a good discussion" of the 
issue. The official refused to elaborate, suggesting that the question remained 
unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
But the official called the dinner meeting "extremely warm and cordial." 
</P>
<P>
Baker and other U.S. officials were taken by surprise last week when West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, under political pressure at home, announced that 
he wants to delay an expected NATO decision on modernizing short-range nuclear 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agreement Sought This Year 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials hoped that the alliance would agree some time this year to 
develop a new version of the current battlefield missile, the Lance. 
</P>
<P>
NATO has deployed an estimated 88 Lance missile launchers with an estimated 700 
nuclear warheads in Western Europe, most of them in West Germany. The 
battlefield missiles, with a range of 70 miles, are intended to deter an attack 
on the West by Soviet tank forces. 
</P>
<P>
But the presence of the missiles has become an increasingly sensitive issue in 
West Germany, which is where they are most likely to be used if a general war 
breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher, who leads the small Free Democratic Party in a governing coalition 
with Kohl's Christian Democrats, has long favored negotiations to reduce or ban 
the short-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who had previously supported the NATO plan to decide on a modernization 
plan this year, said in a British newspaper interview last week that there was 
no need to settle the question until 1991 or 1992 -- after West Germany's next 
election at the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. 'Needs a Decision' 
</P>
<P>
But Baker told British officials in London earlier Sunday that he "needs a 
decision" on the issue to win funding from Congress for the development of a 
modernized missile, according to a British aide. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Wolfgang Schaeuble, a Kohl aide who visited Washington last week, 
told an interviewer that U.S. officials agreed with Bonn that NATO could put 
off a decision on modernization until 1991, but a senior British official 
called Schaeuble's comment "an overstatement." 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the U.S. view that short-range missiles -- those with a range of up 
to 300 miles -- are a necessary part of NATO strategy, Baker said the Bush 
Administration opposes negotiating a ban on the weapons like that concluded on 
intermediate-range missiles in 1987. A U.S.-Soviet agreement banned all 
ground-launched missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not changed our view with respect to the inadvisability of 
negotiating" an agreement on short-range missiles, he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said he is pleased with West Germany's recent actions to crack down 
on West German firms that have been selling equipment for making chemical 
weapons to Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Kohl government's plans to crack down on such exports are "quite promising, 
in our view," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lunch With Thatcher 
</P>
<P>
Baker flew to Bonn after spending 17 hours in Britain, including a working 
lunch with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Chequers, her official country 
residence, 40 miles from London. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that he and Thatcher agreed "on a broad range of issues ranging from 
broad East-West themes to regional issues." 
</P>
<P>
"We and the British remain very, very close together on all these issues," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker noted, however, that he did discuss one point of disagreement with 
British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe: Britain's plea for the United States 
to agree to relax a joint Western ban on high-technology exports to the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was instituted after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. 
Britain has proposed that the curbs be eased slightly to allow for equipment 
with no clear military use to be sold to Moscow. But Baker has said he would 
like to maintain the ban for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
"They would prefer to see the 'no exceptions' rule lifted," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Open Mind 
</P>
<P>
A British official quoted Baker as saying the Administration "has an open mind 
on the question but wants to study it further." 
</P>
<P>
The British official said Baker also assured Howe that the Administration has 
decided to continue its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
despite demands from Israel and U.S. Jewish groups that the talks stop. 
</P>
<P>
Howe urged the secretary of state to continue the contacts to "encourage the 
Palestinians to sustain their present moderate course," the British official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Howe, speaking to reporters on the sidewalk outside his London residence, 
echoed Baker's explanation for the visit, his first overseas trip as secretary 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an occasion for decision-taking," Howe said. "It is an occasion 
for reviewing the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was staying overnight at Schloss Gymnich, a government-owned castle in 
the countryside south of Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he was scheduled to fly on to Denmark and Norway, then to return to 
Bonn for dinner with Kohl and Genscher. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural diplomatic blitz will continue through the week with stops in 
Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands 
and France.

Central Asia aimed at "modernizing military hardware," Tass reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said the blast early Sunday yielded between 20 and 150

5 PAKISTANIS DIE IN ANTI-AMERICAN RIOT

Five demonstrators were shot and killed Sunday and 80 people were seriously 
injured when Pakistani riot police opened fire on thousands of protesters 
attacking the U.S. cultural center here after a demonstration against the 
British novel "The Satanic Verses" turned into a rock-throwing anti-American 
melee. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three Americans or 15 Pakistani employees inside the center at the 
time were hurt, but thousands of dollars in damage was done to the building, 
which houses an American library and sponsors cultural events designed to 
reinforce U.S.-Pakistani ties. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a peaceful demonstration that went wrong," said Kent Obee, head of the 
U.S. Information Service in Pakistan. Obee was inside the building waiting to 
receive a petition from the protesters when the riot erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids started throwing rocks, and it got ugly. . . . They just began 
stoning the building, and the police responded." 
</P>
<P>
The march was initiated by fundamentalists demanding that the United States ban 
the novel, outlawed here, as blasphemous. They say it offends Muslims by 
suggesting that the Prophet Mohammed was fallible. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said police opened fire only after trying to control the 
demonstration with tear gas, an effort they said failed because the wind was 
blowing the wrong way. But journalists and witnesses described the police 
riot-control operation as incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators picked up tear-gas canisters and threw them back at police 
and several times outflanked the police, who ultimately opened fire in panic, 
witnesses said. After firing shots into the air, the police lowered their guns, 
and the shooting went on intermittently for nearly 90 minutes, according to the 
witnesses. Twenty of the injured were police. 
</P>
<P>
Shouting "American dogs!" and "God is great!" the demonstrators also smashed 
their way into the center and set two small fires, but U.S. officials said the 
fervor of the mob did not match the attack of a decade ago on U.S. facilities 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't another 1979," Obee said. "It was just an unfortunate event that 
everyone wishes had never happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burned to the Ground 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, a mob of thousands attacked the American Embassy here and burned 
it to the ground, killing an American Marine and forcing more than a dozen 
embassy employees to lock themselves inside a vault for hours before police 
responded to calls for help. 
</P>
<P>
That protest was triggered by erroneous reports that the United States was 
responsible for fatal shootings at the holiest mosque of the Islamic religion 
in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Originally published in England, Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," the 
object of Sunday's protest, was recently released in the United States. Twice 
recently, the book has touched off protests at the American center in Lahore, 
Pakistan, but both demonstrations ended peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has been simmering for a couple of months," Obee said, adding, "I 
feel a little bit bemused, though, why they went after us rather than the 
British." 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States and Pakistan remain close allies, there has long 
been an undercurrent of anti-Americanism among this country's fundamentalist 
political parties, which are variously aligned with Iran and other nations 
hostile to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's protest was planned by those fundamentalist groups and religious 
scholars, and the U.S. Embassy had warned all Americans in Islamabad to stay 
off the streets during the hours of the scheduled protest.

SOVIET ARMY'S NEW CHIEF SPURNS CALLS TO END CONSCRIPTION

The new chief of staff of the Soviet Union's armed forces Sunday rejected calls 
to abolish conscription because it would be far too expensive to have only a 
professional force. 
</P>
<P>
But Col. Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev said in an interview with Soviet television that 
students will no longer have to interrupt their studies to carry out military 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, creating a professional army is unacceptable both 
now and in the near future, since it would require a five- to eight-fold 
increase in military spending," Moiseyev, 49, said in response to a question. 
</P>
<P>
Military service has been obligatory in the Soviet Union since the early 1920s. 
Men over 18 are required to serve two years in the army or three in the navy. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there has been public discussion of possible changes to the 
current system of conscription, spurred on by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
promise at the United Nations in December to cut Soviet troops by 500,000.

AFGHAN REBELS TALK OF MILITARY RULE; 
</P>

FIELD COMMANDERS PREPARED TO ACT IF POLITICAL TALKS FAIL

Afghan guerrilla commanders, disillusioned by incessant wrangling among the 
political leaders of the Afghan resistance, are drawing up a "security plan" -- 
a military operation to keep order in Afghanistan if the Soviet-backed regime 
falls with no interim rebel government ready to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Sunday by Abdul Haq, a prominent rebel commander who has 
spent about a third of his life at the forefront of the moujahedeen's war 
against the Moscow-installed regime in his country. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying the infighting among rebel politicians as they try to agree on how 
things should be run when the Kabul government of President Najibullah 
collapses, as expected, Haq said: 
</P>
<P>
"The people are tired. I am tired. Everybody's tired. Up to now there was some 
hope they (the rebel political leaders) would come up with a solution. Maybe 
some (of us) lost hope six months ago, maybe some two months ago, maybe some 
now, maybe some a month from now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wounded 15 Times 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Haq, who has been wounded 15 times and lost a foot and most of 
his hair in the war, echoed the sentiments of many other rebel military 
commanders interviewed by The Times during the past week as the political 
wrangling continued. 
</P>
<P>
"We watch them, we give them a chance," he said of the rebels' political 
leaders. "But if we see they are doing nothing, well then, maybe we will have 
to decide ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in his hotel room as leaders of the seven political parties in the 
rebel alliance continued informal weekend meetings and bargaining aimed at 
breaking impasses that forced a temporary adjournment of Friday's rebel 
assembly here, Haq talked about the "security plan." He said that rebel 
commanders inside Afghanistan have a plan to secure all government buildings, 
embassies, international agencies and private property in the Afghan capital of 
Kabul and other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the rebel political parties) cannot come together for whatever 
reasons, we cannot just let the country finish and burn and die and be 
destroyed just because of this problem," said Haq, who is regarded as one of 
the most powerful rebel commanders in the Kabul region. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way is to have an interim government to install. But in case there is 
disagreement, we have to be prepared. If the (Najibullah) regime collapses . . 
. there should be at least some security." 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing the plan, Haq also confirmed recent speculation by senior 
diplomats and other analysts here that the guerrilla commanders increasingly 
are taking over the direction of the war, as the seven-party rebel alliance 
appears to be collapsing into internal squabbling. The alliance was created 
largely to funnel U.S.-supplied arms and other support to moujahedeen 
commanders inside Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been loyal to the (political) leaders," said Haq, who has been 
fighting under the auspices of one of the seven parties, despite the fact that 
most of his operations have been on individual initiative. "We are still loyal 
to the leaders. But when we know there is something they are doing that is no 
good for anybody, then it is not enough to be loyal to them." 
</P>
<P>
The focus of the commanders' criticism is the so-called shoora, or assembly, 
convened in Islamabad by the alliance last Friday. Haq, like many other 
commanders, intellectuals and influential tribal chiefs who have formed the 
core of the resistance, is a delegate to the 420-member shoora, which seemed to 
have collapsed in chaos an hour after it was called to order Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the shoora was just suspended indefinitely, and the rebel leaders met 
informally throughout the weekend to sort out differences between the 
Pakistan-based, hard-line fundamentalist Islamic parties that dominate the 
rebel alliance and the moderate parties, which are allied with Shiite Afghan 
groups based in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
An example of the squabbling was provided in a Sunday morning press conference 
by the Afghanistan National Liberation Front, a moderate party headed by 
Sibghatullah Mojaddidi. Mojaddidi's son, Zabiullah, charged that there is "a 
conspiracy to insult" his party's delegates by fundamentalist groups and the 
Pakistani government, which, he claimed, jailed two of the party's 
representatives to keep them from attending the shoora. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his party will now boycott the shoora when it reconvenes, which is 
expected to occur before Wednesday, the younger Mojaddidi said, "Our pulling 
out of the shoora is not at this time a certain issue; it is a possible issue." 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Pakistan's government, which has favored the 
fundamentalists in the past but now describes itself as interested mainly in 
any compromise that will bring political stability to Afghanistan, was trying 
to persuade the leader of the Iran-based rebel groups to attend the next 
session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Back Into Afghanistan 
</P>
<P>
Some of the commanders of the smaller, rural rebel groups have been so 
alienated by the political fracas that they have crossed back into Afghanistan. 
But Haq said the recess in the shoora was welcome because it gave quarreling 
groups time to discuss their differences. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he confessed that he was as confused as any outsider trying to understand 
the political developments within the rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I have more questions than answers," he said. "We still don't know 
what's going on. It's a critical moment of the war. People want answers. People 
want to see the result of the struggle and the sacrifice they made for 10 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Haq explained that most of the commanders inside Afghanistan formed alliances 
with the Pakistan-based parties simply because, in a war that appeared without 
end, a continuing supply of arms and ammunition meant survival.

At one point during the interview, Haq -- who describes himself as neither a 
fundamentalist nor a moderate but as a fervent nationalist -- was asked if he 
could live in an Afghanistan dominated by fundamentalist leaders such as Abdul 
Rasul Sayyaf, who called a press conference Saturday to spend an hour 
reprimanding the foreign press for allegedly misreporting Friday's shoora and 
demanding, "You must correct your mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
"We're really tired of being told how to live, what to wear, where to go, what 
to eat," he said. "I don't think this will last."

BHUTTO DENIES AFGHAN LEADER'S CHARGE OF PLANNED INVASION

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan on Sunday denied a charge by Afghan 
President Najibullah that her government plans to invade Afghanistan and try to 
annex that country. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got enough problems of national integration," the visiting prime 
minister said at a Beijing press conference. "We don't need foreign adventures. 
. . . There are no Pakistani troops being massed on the border with 
Afghanistan." 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah, in an apparent bid to rally support to his beleaguered government, 
charged in a radio and television address Saturday that Pakistan was moving 
troops to the border in preparation for an invasion. The Soviet Union is due to 
pull the last of its troops out of Afghanistan by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Najibullah also said that the guerrillas have agreed to Pakistani plans to 
annex Afghanistan under the guise of a "confederation." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto stopped short of flatly ruling out an eventual confederation with 
Afghanistan, but she said that no one has ever proposed such an idea to her 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see what the Afghan people decide for themselves first before you look 
at any further questions," Bhutto said. "Stray ideas . . . may have come up in 
the past in relation to Afghanistan. I do not know because they have not 
gathered the weight to be considered by anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto called Najibullah's charges "a bid to divert attention from the real 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
She repeated a call for the transfer of power in Afghanistan to a "broad-based" 
interim government made up of elements from the various rebel factions, but she 
said there are limits to Pakistan's role. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can do is exert our influence for a political settlement and hope that 
the different groups come to an agreement between themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng of China expressed similar views in talks with Bhutto on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned about the current trend of an internal war in 
Afghanistan," Li said, according to the official New China News Agency. "We 
don't want to see deterioration of this situation, and hope that a coalition 
government (will) be established on a broad basis and acceptable to all parties 
so that peace could return to the country." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto said the purpose of her visit her "has been both to symbolize the 
traditional friendship and to establish a rapport with the present Chinese 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto is scheduled to meet with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in Shanghai today 
before returning home.

SON OF LEGENDARY BOSS AHEAD OF BLACK ACTING MAYOR IN POLLS; 
</P>
<P>
A YOUNGER DALEY STIRS OLD LOYALTIES IN CHICAGO

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was not quite the Second Coming, but you would have thought so from the way 
the crowd went wild when Richard M. Daley entered the room. 
</P>
<P>
A Dixieland band was tooting out a toe-tapping version of "Chicago, Chicago," 
the local answer to "Hail to the Chief," which they had started playing on cue 
a moment earlier, when Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer walked through the door. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Daley, Sawyer had been greeted with only polite applause, but what more 
could he expect? This was Daley country, the working-class neighborhood of 
Bridgeport where Daley's father, the legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley, lived 
his whole life. Tonight a library was being dedicated in his honor. Sawyer was 
something of an interloper at this family affair. 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer will be squaring off against Daley in the Democratic mayoral primary on 
Feb. 28. There is no need to ask which candidate people came to see. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could just get a glimpse of Richard Daley," sighed a 50-ish-looking woman 
with an Irish brogue as she struggled to squeeze through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs on Display 
</P>
<P>
Easier to see were two photographs that hung on the wall above the desk where 
library books are checked out and returned. 
</P>
<P>
One was of Sawyer. It is his smiling official portrait, and in it he appears 
amiable though bland, much like the man himself -- the spitting image of 
someone's favorite uncle waking up from a nap. 
</P>
<P>
The other -- slightly larger -- photograph was of the legend, the Boss who 
ruled this city for 21 years until his death in 1976. He looked dapper and, 
well, Boss-like, in a black fedora and coat, a white handkerchief in his breast 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see the pictures on the wall?" a woman in the audience asked a friend. 
"Did you see the signs hanging in front of them? The sign in front of Daley 
says 'Return,' and the one in front of Sawyer says 'Check Out.' " 
</P>
<P>
Loud laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the packed room people independently noted the symbolism, and loved 
it. If the polls and pundits are correct, Sawyer indeed may be checking out of 
the mayor's office on City Hall's fifth floor come April, when the general 
election will be held. Boss Daley will not be returning, barring a resurrection 
the likes of which even Chicago has never seen. But for many residents of 
Bridgeport and other areas of the city, the younger Daley's emergence is the 
next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Significant Election 
</P>
<P>
Racially speaking -- and in the world of Chicago politics there seems to be no 
other way -- the election is a significant one. 
</P>
<P>
For whites, the contest is the first chance since 1983 to regain City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
For blacks, who rejoiced over Harold Washington's victory six years ago as 
Chicago's first black mayor, and who joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 
proclaiming "our time has come," the race demonstrates that holding onto power 
can be as difficult as getting it in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
When Daley, 46, ran for mayor the first time in 1983, he came in third, 
splitting the white vote with Mayor Jane M. Byrne. This helped to ensure a 
Washington victory. Many whites had a hard time forgiving him for that. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, it is the black electorate that is splintered. In a city 
with almost equal black and white populations, this discord has given Daley a 
golden opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Peaks, Valleys 
</P>
<P>
"There has always been lulls, peaks and valleys in the movement," said Conrad 
Worrill, chairman of the National Black Political Front and a local activist. 
"If for some reason we lose the fifth floor and Richard Daley becomes mayor, 
then we should be prepared for that." 
</P>
<P>
Lu Palmer, another black political organizer, has an even more pessimistic 
view. "If young Daley gets to be the mayor, we will be thrown back to the 
pre-Harold Washington years and it will take who knows how many decades to 
recover," he said. The black electorate, Palmer said, would be "politically 
devastated." 
</P>
<P>
After Washington's sudden death in late 1987, Sawyer and black Alderman Timothy 
Evans competed to be chosen Washington's successor. Evans, who was Washington's 
floor leader on the City Council, proclaimed himself the late mayor's rightful 
heir. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson threw his support behind Evans, but Sawyer, backed by many of the 
whites who had battled with Washington, won the City Council selection in a 
stormy, all-night council meeting. In essence, that was when this mayoral 
campaign began, with Evans vowing to oust Sawyer from office. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a split in the black vote that would ensure a Daley victory in the 
primary, Evans last month formed the independent Harold Washington Party and 
declared that he will face the Democratic winner in the April general election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Endorse Sawyer 
</P>
<P>
A host of prominent black leaders, including Jackson, have since endorsed 
Sawyer in the primary. But Jackson and many of the others made it clear that 
they likely will support Evans in April. 
</P>
<P>
For the Democratic Party nationally, there are important overtones. Ron Brown, 
Jackson's 1988 convention manager and the new Democratic National Committee 
chairman, may find the contest to be the first test of his leadership of the 
party. He has already indicated he will back the winner of the party's primary 
against Evans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Shufflin' Uncle Tom' 
</P>
<P>
Evans has been urging his supporters to sit out the primary entirely, and in 
December a prominent Evans supporter began publicly referring to Sawyer as a 
"shufflin' Uncle Tom," a charge that "just sent shock waves through a large 
chunk of the black community," according to Paul Green, author of a book on 
Washington's last campaign. 
</P>
<P>
According to a poll conducted in late January by local television station WLS, 
48% of those responding supported Daley and Sawyer was favored by 32%. A third 
candidate in the primary, Alderman Lawrence Bloom, received 12%. 
</P>
<P>
If the election were held now, 72% of the white voters, 64% of Latino voters 
and 17% of the black voters would support Daley, according to the poll. In 
Washington's two campaigns, he had near-total black support and still barely 
won. 
</P>
<P>
So far the contest has been relatively free of the ugly racial scenes and 
tensions that accompanied Washington's campaigns and his first term in office, 
during which white aldermen blocked most of his initiatives. Both Sawyer and 
Daley have campaigned in all sections of the city and have stressed the need 
for racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign has so far been so low-key, in fact, that Chicago Tribune 
columnist Mike Royko complained last month that it is almost as if someone 
"slipped a large dose of Valium into the city's water supply. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
That all could be changing this week. Sawyer is unleashing a series of new 
hard-hitting television commercials that attack Daley's record as state's 
attorney and question his abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Sawyer, who by far has the best-financed campaign with a reported 
$4-million war chest, has been emphasizing his "quiet, effective leadership" in 
his commercials. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the lack of racial divisiveness in the race is that the idea of 
a black mayor in Chicago is no longer new, Green said. "Chicago has had not one 
but two black mayors, so the fear and the novelty have pretty well worn off," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Players 
</P>
<P>
"But most importantly," he added, "the players are not the same. There's no one 
running who can turn a phrase or turn the dagger like Harold Washington, Jane 
Byrne or Ed Vrdolyak (the white alderman who bitterly opposed Washington). The 
tensions were already there, but the way those characters played it also 
exacerbated it." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, neither Sawyer nor Daley is known for either his oratory or his 
charisma. Although both men recently have improved their speaking styles, 
Sawyer's nickname in the media remains "Mayor Mumbles." And the malaprop-prone 
Daley is so reticent and shy that in the past he has had trouble putting 
together complete sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Tribune, in an article last week that dealt with perceptions of 
Daley's intelligence, quoted one detractor as saying: "He's just dumb as a 
rock. If his name were Richard M. Camper (instead of Daley), he'd be working in 
the post office." 
</P>
<P>
In his television commercials, Daley -- who has avoided one-on-one interviews 
and declined to make several joint appearances with the other candidates -- 
acknowledges that he is not a good speaker. He emphasizes his leadership 
abilities and his tough stands on crime and ideas for improving the schools. 
</P>
<P>
One of his supporters is William Singer, a former alderman who ran 
unsuccessfully for mayor as a reformer against the elder Daley in 1975. He said 
he is impressed by Daley's initiatives in the areas of public education, health 
care, child care -- "social issues that the city of Chicago never really dealt 
with from the mayor's office." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Richie is his father," said Singer, explaining his support. "I 
think Rich Daley understands that the city needs to be governed from a very 
different perspective." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dogged by Controversies 
</P>
<P>
Sawyer, 54, has been dogged by the perception that he is a weak leader and by 
controversies over his refusal to release his tax returns. He also has been 
damaged by his admission shortly after he became mayor that he accepted $30,000 
in consulting fees in 1978 and 1979 from an attorney seeking crucial land 
rezoning in his ward. 
</P>
<P>
Further damaging him with Jewish voters was his slowness to fire an aide last 
spring who made anti-Semitic remarks. 
</P>
<P>
So far the coalition of blacks, Latinos and so-called "lakefront liberals" that 
helped elect Washington shows no sign of coalescing again. 
</P>
<P>
"The great genius of Richard J. Daley was his ability to adapt to the 
demographics of Chicago, and that's what his son is doing now," said Green of 
Daley's new-found appeal to affluent whites. "He is bringing Bridgeport to the 
lakefront." 
</P>
<P>
Singer, the prototypical "lakefront liberal," said he believes many whites who 
supported Washington are turning to Daley because of Sawyer's perceived 
weaknesses and because they have been turned off by the attitude expressed by 
Evans' supporters that the next mayor of Chicago, regardless of qualifications, 
should be black. 
</P>
<P>
Daley is similar to his father in many ways, said Singer, "but the irony is 
that he's not as closely aligned with the old machine politics as these other 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked Through System 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, while Washington was a reformer who long ago broke from Boss Daley's 
Democratic machine, Sawyer and Evans both worked their way up through the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Evans talks often of the "Harold Washington movement," of which he says he is a 
part. But political organizer Palmer said: "I simply do not accept Evans as a 
movement politician, nor do I see Sawyer in that light. I don't know what they 
mean by movement. . . . By movement I mean the activities of those of us who 
through the years have fought against machine politics and for liberation of 
our people on all counts. None of the candidates fit that description."

NEW PRESIDENTS, MORE CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
FOR U.S. AND MEXICO, A SHORT HONEYMOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was to have been a long and peaceful honeymoon: An upbeat, preinaugural 
meeting between Presidents-elect George Bush and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 
Houston last November led diplomats to predict an era of calm in U.S.-Mexico 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
The new leaders hit it off personally. Once in power, their Cabinet choices 
pointed to similar political views, particularly on the economy. Bush's 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has a firm grasp of Latin America's debt 
crisis; Salinas' Foreign Minister Fernando Solana Morales was last a banker. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of everyone's best intentions, a series of controversies has 
erupted that again illustrates a seemingly chronic lack of understanding 
between the United States and Mexico, and a proclivity for conflict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Exactly Honeymooners 
</P>
<P>
Rather than honeymooners, the two administrations already seem more like an old 
married couple, with each partner apparently incapable of hearing what the 
other has to say. 
</P>
<P>
Recent actions by both governments -- the naming of John D. Negroponte as U.S. 
ambassador to Mexico, the announcement of American plans to build a border 
ditch to keep out illegal immigrants and Salinas' appointment of a man who is a 
fugitive from U.S. justice as Mexico's chief of police intelligence -- failed 
to take into account the other's reaction and have aggravated strained 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Further complicating matters was CIA Director William H. Webster's statement 
last week that Mexico's political and economic situation is fragile. He said 
the United States has "enormous counterintelligence responsibilities" in Mexico 
and urged bipartisan support for covert action in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
The remarks came on the heels of the controversial appointment of Negroponte, 
who was ambassador to Honduras at the height of the U.S.-backed Contra war in 
Nicaragua, reinforcing fears among the political opposition that a 
counterinsurgency specialist was picked to set up a covert network in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Envoy Seen as a Hard-Liner 
</P>
<P>
"The signal is that they are sending a hard-liner to deal with potential 
instability," said Sergio Aguayo, an authority on U.S.-Mexico relations at the 
post-graduate Colegio de Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials privately acknowledge that the announcement of Negroponte's 
appointment was mishandled. The news was leaked to the media before the Mexican 
government was officially notified and given a chance to respond. 
</P>
<P>
But many officials remain baffled by the extent of opposition to Negroponte. 
</P>
<P>
"I am always amazed by how insecure Mexicans are about the big, bad American 
ambassador," one U.S. official said. "They always think he is going to 
intervene in their internal affairs. I can't grasp this outlook, why they draw 
so many connections from so many unrelated things." 
</P>
<P>
But the Americans failed to anticipate the obvious, responded Manuel Garcia y 
Griego, a historian and expert on U.S.-Mexican relations at the Colegio de 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A Mexican president has difficulty cooperating with the United States because a 
history of U.S. intervention in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America forces 
him to run the risk of being perceived as submitting to American pressure, 
Garcia y Griego explained. In addition, Salinas faces unprecedented internal 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with half a brain should have been able to figure out that Negroponte 
would be a problem," Garcia y Griego said. "He is going to be a symbol in 
Mexico of right-wing intervention from the United States. From a Mexican 
government point of view, it will be difficult to conduct relations with him in 
any way that implies collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
Mexico was similarly bewildered last month over the announcement of the United 
States' intention to build a border ditch at Otay Mesa, near San Ysidro, Calif. 
to keep out vehicles carrying illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Classic Example 
</P>
<P>
The ditch issue is a classic example of the lack of communication between the 
two countries, and of how decisions made for internal reasons can affect the 
other side. 
</P>
<P>
According to both U.S. and Mexican officials, the Mexican government suggested 
the building of a water drainage channel as a solution to the problem of waste 
water from U.S. industries spilling into Mexico along Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The American section of the International Boundary and Water Commission agreed 
to study the idea. Then the Immigration and Naturalization Service jumped on 
board, offering to help pay for the project because it would keep automobiles 
from crossing illegally into that area, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
But neither agency apparently informed the Mexican government of the new 
purpose for the ditch. And INS officials, strictly to head off criticism from 
anti-immigration groups at home, suddenly announced their intention to build 
the ditch to keep out illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. 'Took Advantage' 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico proposed the channel," a Foreign Ministry official explained with 
irritation. "Then in the United States, some fifth-level bureaucrat took 
advantage of a project that is objectively necessary and gave it an emotional 
charge, putting dynamite into something that didn't have to be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to their own highly centralized system, many Mexican officials and 
intellectuals viewed the affair as an effort to embarrass their government. 
They failed to understand that U.S. foreign policy is made and carried out, not 
just by the President, but by several, often-competing government 
bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
Competing interests apparently prompted the U.S. Justice Department to leak a 
letter from former Secretary of State George P. Shultz that relayed a request 
from the Salinas administration for information linking Mexican military and 
government officials to drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. law enforcement officials seemingly did not want to turn over the 
information for fear of compromising Mexican sources. Embarrassed, the Mexican 
government denied it made the request. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just as Guilty 
</P>
<P>
But the Mexican government can be as guilty as its northern neighbor of 
shortsighted decision-making. Soon after Salinas took office last December, 
Miguel Nazar Haro, a fugitive from the United States, was named chief of police 
intelligence in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nazar Haro also has a checkered reputation in Mexico, officials here 
simply viewed him as the best intelligence man they have. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Nazar Haro was indicted by a U.S. grand jury in San Diego on car theft 
and conspiracy charges. He was arrested in the United States, posted $200,000 
bail and fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had realized the reaction we would get from the United States, Nazar 
wouldn't have been appointed," a Foreign Ministry official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Yet conflict is natural between two such different countries that share a 
2,000-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
"This was very unfortunate," said one U.S. official of the recent tension. "I 
believe the Salinas government wanted a honeymoon. I have no indication the 
Bush Administration didn't want it. So I just have to believe we don't know how 
to do that."

NEW POSTAL COMPLEX IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A. WILL GIVE ECONOMIC BOOST TO AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Koiu Chang Lee can remember when the view from the doorway of his grocery in 
South-Central Los Angeles was not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
Directly across the street from the neighborhood store on South Central Avenue 
near Gage Avenue was the hulking shell of a long-vacant tire plant surrounded 
by weeds that grew as tall as a man. On rainy days, the unpaved walk around the 
plant oozed brown mud into the street. On dry days, the weeds became a trash 
receptacle for passers-by. Lee's customers were mostly neighborhood people 
because passing motorists didn't often stop along a business strip where most 
of the storefronts were boarded up. He was making an adequate income for 
himself and his family, he said, but just barely. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Lee stood in the front of his store and looked out at a different 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Where the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. plant once stood is a newly constructed 
Main Post Office and General Mail Facility for Los Angeles, a sprawling complex 
of modern, low-slung gray and green buildings with landscaped grounds that 
after next Saturday will be the center of postal operations for the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work Force of 5,500 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which will have a work force of 5,500, is expected to boost the 
economy in the neighborhood five miles south of downtown, not by bringing new 
jobs to people in the neighborhood, but by bringing in people who have jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the positions at the complex will be filled by workers who now 
work downtown at the outdated Terminal Annex mail processing operation near 
Union Station. Other jobs will be filled through the Postal Service's regular 
Civil Service procedure. 
</P>
<P>
The post office will remain open at Terminal Annex, but the buildings where 
mail is processed will be sold or leased once the city Community Redevelopment 
Agency comes up with a master plan for the area around Union Station, postal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Those expected to benefit most from the huge transfer of personnel from 
downtown to South-Central are people like Lee, owners of small businesses who 
hope postal workers will cash their checks, eat meals and buy merchandise near 
where they work. 
</P>
<P>
Already, in mere anticipation of the opening of the postal complex, a 
restaurant has opened across the street, two others are planned and established 
businesses are expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Lee is having a portion of his store remodeled into Main Post Office Check 
Cashing, a walk-up check-cashing stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides the environmental effect, I don't know what benefit (the postal 
complex) will bring to me," he said, "but I'm going to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
Buster Williams, 30, one of the owners of the Lil Rascals Cafe directly across 
from the postal complex's employee parking lot, said he and his brother, Merk, 
had the postal workers in mind last year when they bought three badly 
deteriorated storefronts for $60,000 and had them combined. Their restaurant 
opened in December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope for New Clientele 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not depending totally on the post office people," Buster Williams said, 
"but I am hoping they will be a large part of our clientele." 
</P>
<P>
The Williams brothers, both truck drivers, grew up not far from the old tire 
plant and still live there. They have not been in business before and probably 
wouldn't be now, said Buster Williams, if it were not for the new postal 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood around the complex is a mixture of residences and industrial 
sites. Between it and downtown are trucking firms and fresh fruit and flower 
distribution markets. The neighborhood is generally poor and parts of it are 
run-down. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of some of the tiny bungalows just east of the complex said they 
welcome any new businesses near their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Since Goodyear closed the whole strip has been dead," said Vernell Holloway, a 
young mother who lives on 68th Street. "You had to walk a pretty good ways to 
find a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Projects 
</P>
<P>
Now the strip is reviving. Besides Lee's addition to his store and the opening 
of Lil Rascals, these enterprises were under way within two blocks of 
Holloway's home: 
</P>
<P>
* Louis Hale is planning to expand his check-cashing operation for what he 
expects to be a 300% increase in business. Hale said he bought the property for 
$44,000 four years ago, and recently was offered $200,000 for it. 
</P>
<P>
* Owners of the Fat &amp; Fat Market are renovating a storefront that will 
become the Fat &amp; Fat Chinese Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
* The owner of the building that once housed the United Rubber Workers union is 
having the structure demolished to make way for a mini-mall that is already 80% 
leased. A single unleased unit, said the man's real estate broker, is being 
sought by a major hamburger chain. 
</P>
<P>
Charles W. King, general manager and postmaster for the Los Angeles division of 
the U.S. Postal Service, said no one is happier than he about the optimism 
among the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
King called the postal complex "the most major development in South-Central 
since the Watts riot." 
</P>
<P>
The $151.6-million complex is on 74 acres of land bounded by South Central 
Avenue on the east, railway lines and an industrial park on McKinley Avenue on 
the west, Florence Avenue on the south and Gage Avenue on the north. It is 
dedicated to the late Leslie Nelson Shaw Sr., who was postmaster for Los 
Angeles from 1963 to 1969 and the first black to head the post office of a 
major American city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Complex 
</P>
<P>
The six buildings constructed since 1985 include a neighborhood post office, a 
three-story administrative building, a warehouse, a garage, a maintenance 
support building, and a state-of-the-art mail processing plant the size of 10 
football fields. 
</P>
<P>
The processing plant will handle 6.7 million pieces of mail daily and is 
equipped to accommodate increases in the city's mail flow for the next 20 
years, postal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
South-Central residents will receive no preferential treatment for the jobs at 
the complex, but they won't have to travel as far to apply for work. The 
personnel office that hires for all of the Postal Service's operations in Los 
Angeles has been moved to the South-Central complex. 
</P>
<P>
King, who along with other administrators moved his office from downtown to the 
new complex months ago, said he has heard nothing "adverse" from people who 
live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"They recognize that there will be new investment" in the neighborhood, he 
said. "The reaction to that has been very favorable."

SEXUAL AGGRESSION STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some young men are so strongly attracted to sexual aggression that more than a 
fourth of those responding to a scientific inquiry said they would be at least 
somewhat likely to commit rape if they could get away with it, a UCLA 
researcher reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the current issue of the Journal of Sex Research, UCLA psychology 
professor Neil Malamuth said there is a substantial number of men who have 
never committed such an act, but who do not find sexual aggressiveness 
reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
"The data suggest that to actually commit sexual aggression, several 
personality tendencies have to be present," Malamuth said. "But there is a 
profile of people who are attracted to sexual aggression and another profile 
for those who actually commit it." 
</P>
<P>
To make his assessments, Malamuth and his colleagues developed a 14-item 
questionnaire that allowed them to clearly separate sexual aggressiveness from 
other forms of aggressive behavior, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six percent of the men surveyed, all of whom were university students in 
Canada, ranging between ages 18 and 25, said they would be at least somewhat 
likely to commit rape if they could escape punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"More men said they would force a woman to commit a sexual act against her will 
than (would) rob a bank," Malamuth said of a two-part question asked of the 
test subjects. 
</P>
<P>
But only 1.7% of the respondents said they would be very likely to commit rape 
if they could get away with it, Malamuth said.

A concoction invented at the University of Wisconsin appears to be much better 
for preserving livers awaiting transplantation into human recipients, and 
doctors hope the solution will someday give them more time for heart 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
In an article last week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., six 
researchers from the University of Pittsburgh's Department of Surgery said the 
Wisconsin mixture preserved 185 human livers for periods averaging twice as 
long as 180 organs stored in a standard solution.

BATTLING THE THE BEAST WITHIN US; 
</P>
<P>
IF IT'S FEBRUARY, IT MUST BE THE BIG, BAD FLU SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY SQUIRES, Squires is a medical writer for The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It begins simply enough: a few aches and pains, perhaps a sore throat and 
headache, all the symptoms that might suggest a cold. But within hours, the 
fever ascends, the chills, joint pains and malaise start and the cough takes 
hold -- a dry, sometimes gut-wrenching hack that makes it seem as if the lungs 
and throat have been scraped with sandpaper. 
</P>
<P>
Influenza. It is expected in February -- as sure a thing each year as death and 
taxes. And it peaks just about this time every year, although indications are 
that this year's flu epidemic may be slightly milder than other years, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control, the federal agency responsible 
for monitoring outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Lest that news lull anyone into complacency, consider this: 
</P>
<P>
* By the time this winter is over, influenza will still infect one in every 
four to five Americans. 
</P>
<P>
* About three-quarters of those infected will get sick. Half of them will see a 
doctor for their symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
* A quarter of a million Americans will be hospitalized and 40,000 to 50,000 
will die this year, making influenza the sixth-leading cause of death in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
* Influenza epidemics cost $10 billion annually in direct medical costs and 
lost wages, according to CDC estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"Influenza is still a major disease, although it gets pushed into the 
background by other viruses such as herpes and AIDS," said Peter Palese, 
chairman of the microbiology department at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Public health officials used to think that flu epidemics occurred in cycles: 
Some medical textbooks still report that physicians can expect epidemics of 
influenza A, the more virulent form of the virus, every two to three years and 
epidemics of influenza B every four to five years. But 15 years of close 
surveillance of viruses by Baylor College of Medicine's Influenza Research 
Center in Houston has taught researchers that "there is no such thing as a 
non-epidemic influenza year," said Dr. Robert Couch, the center's director. 
It's just that some years are more virulent than others. 
</P>
<P>
Flu-like illnesses have been reported since the 15th Century, and the disease 
also has been found in birds, pigs and seals. But it wasn't until 1933 that 
scientists first determined that influenza was caused by a virus. Influenza 
viruses are some of the fastest-changing viruses in the world, a fact that 
makes it "unlikely that the virus will be done away with in our lifetime," 
Couch said. "Our target is to simply knock the tops off the epidemics." 
</P>
<P>
Influenza epidemics typically begin in schoolchildren, then move like wildfire 
through their families and fan out from there to the rest of the population. 
"About 50 million people are at risk for influenza," said Dr. John LaMontagne, 
director of the infectious disease and microbiology program at the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Among those at greatest risk for the fatal complications of influenza are 
people already weakened by other illnesses, particularly those with heart and 
respiratory diseases, cancer patients and people who have had organ 
transplants. Those 64 and older also are at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women are vulnerable as well, particularly during the third trimester 
because blood volume peaks at that time and the heart is under the greatest 
stress. A case of flu can be enough to push a woman's cardiovascular system 
over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Couch and his colleagues at the Influenza Research Center are 
now conducting a study to determine the safety and efficacy of giving pregnant 
women flu shots. 
</P>
<P>
First reports about the flu this year show that the outbreaks have been of 
three strains; most have been a type B influenza, known as Victoria, said Dr. 
Alan Kendal, director of the CDC's Influenza Branch. The rest have been a 
combination of two different types of influenza A. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern "seems to be the reverse of what we had last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion that this year's epidemic may be slightly less severe than usual 
is no reason to avoid being immunized. And it is still not too late to be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at the beginning of a flu epidemic, it's not too late to be immunized," 
said Dr. Edwin D. Kilbourne, distinguished service professor at Mt. Sinai 
School of Medicine. The reason: It can take three to four weeks for an epidemic 
in one location to peak, but it is possible to "get substantial immunity from 
flu shots within 10 days or so," Kilbourne said. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 million to 15 million Americans get flu shots each year, but that is 
only about a quarter of the population in the greatest risk of dying of 
influenza complications like pneumonia. "The national objective is to keep 
increasing this percentage to the 50% to 60% mark (of those at risk)," Kendal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The vaccine costs about $3 per dose and supply is a problem. "We are 
perpetually undercovered by vaccine," LaMontagne said. "We don't have enough to 
go around." 
</P>
<P>
In part, this is a problem of production. Only three companies manufacture 
influenza vaccines in the United States: Connaught, Parke-Davis and Wyeth 
Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
But another problem that hampers production is simply figuring out which 
vaccine to produce. In 1957, for example, the Asian flu virus was late in being 
identified and there wasn't enough time to immunize a substantial number of 
people. As a result, 70,000 people died of influenza and its related side 
effects that year. 
</P>
<P>
Those who get flu shots can usually count on good protection. About half the 
times, the vaccine mix is right on the mark for a given year's epidemic, Kendal 
said. (This year, so far, has been one of those years.) 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the time, the degree of error can range "from minimal to total." 
But Kendal said there "are very, very few cases when we feel that a vaccine 
would not have a beneficial effect." The worst that will happen is that the 
vaccine won't protect completely against infection, but what it always does is 
to protect against the extreme effects of influenza. For instance, the 
incidence of pneumonia and other side effects of flu are cut by about 50% to 
70% by the vaccines, Kendal said. 
</P>
<P>
The older someone is, the less likely that the vaccine will prevent the flu. 
But even if a person gets sick, the trade-off for losing significant protection 
against simple infection, Kendal said, "is that we may be able to keep them out 
of the hospital and alive." 
</P>
<P>
Influenza spreads through the air via the sneezes and coughs that ricochet 
everywhere during flu season. Anywhere people have close contact is a potential 
hotbed for the virus, but one of the best illustrations of how easily flu can 
spread is on airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Epidemiologists once traced an outbreak of flu to a single infected woman who 
sat in the back seat of the plane. The air inside the cabin recirculated as the 
plane sat waiting for takeoff. Later, 75% of the passengers came down with the 
flu, simply from breathing the contaminated air that the sick woman exhaled. 
</P>
<P>
When an epidemic gains a foothold (in Northern climates it usually occurs 
sometime between mid- and late-December), the influenza viruses tend to 
overwhelm all other respiratory viruses for the next eight to 12 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The same pattern is repeated during the winter season in the Southern 
hemisphere. "There is no place to my knowledge that is flu-free," LaMontagne 
said. "You will find flu even in tropical areas if you look for it." 
</P>
<P>
Influenza viruses move around the world the way birds migrate -- a pattern that 
seems to be more than coincidental. It appears that wild birds, which do not 
become sick from influenza, provide the perfect reservoir and transportation 
for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Flu shots, which are made up of viral material, are designed to protect people 
from a particular strain of influenza virus. In the United States, the only flu 
shots approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration contain killed 
influenza virus -- that is, virus deactivated so that it can't cause an 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
But a new generation of vaccines containing live virus is coming. These new 
vaccines are under investigation in the United States and are already being 
used in the Soviet Union and other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
New and improved flu shots may soon involve a combination approach -- one that 
takes advantage of certain important proteins produced by the flu virus. One of 
these proteins, called neuraminidase, allows the virus to enter and exit cells. 
The idea would be to inject humans with neuraminidase, which would 
theoretically alert the immune system to the presence of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative routes are also under investigation for administering the live 
vaccine. At UCLA and at Baylor's Influenza Research Center in Houston, studies 
are examining the effectiveness of nose-drop vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
How do you know if you have the flu? Detecting the virus is virtually 
impossible, unless you have a laboratory test that is usually too 
time-consuming for all but the Centers for Disease Control to use. 
</P>
<P>
This means that most cases of flu are diagnosed by symptoms that could be 
caused by a range of respiratory infections. The thinking is that if you come 
down with flu symptoms at the time an epidemic is moving through your area, you 
probably have the flu, although your doctor might take a throat culture to rule 
out a strep infection. 
</P>
<P>
Classic flu signs are a bad cough, fever, chills and joint pain. But the real 
giveaway is an overwhelming feeling that you're really sick and the only place 
you can possibly survive is in bed. 
</P>
<P>
If you find yourself prone for a few very miserable days, hold onto this happy 
thought: the sicker you are, the better the immunity that you develop, at least 
to that strain of flu virus. Provided that there are no drastic changes in 
virus strains, your immunity will last four to five years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the best treatment for most cases of flu is what Dr. Mom 
always prescribed: bed rest and plenty of fluids.

A drug approved for some stroke patients may also reinvigorate sluggish, aging 
brains with the quick-witted learning ability of youth, a group of Chicago 
researchers reports. 
</P>
<P>
In tests on groups of young and middle-aged rabbits at Northwestern University 
Medical School, researchers said in the journal Science that a drug called 
nimodipine is able to correct age-related mental slowness so that the older 
rabbits can learn as well as the younger ones. 
</P>
<P>
"They (older rabbits receiving the drug) actually learned at the same rate, if 
not slightly faster than the young rabbits," said John F. Disterhoft, an 
associate professor of cell biology at Northwestern, who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Two-thirds of the control group (older rabbits not receiving the drug) never 
did learn the task."

<P>
In the topsy-turvy world of college basketball this season, another team was 
toppled after only a week at No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey King scored 24 points and Oklahoma overcame a seven-point second-half 
deficit Sunday to beat top-ranked Arizona, 82-80. 
</P>
<P>
Because Oklahoma also defeated No. 3 Missouri this week, No. 2 Georgetown lost 
to Pittsburgh and No. 4 Louisville lost to Florida State and UCLA, the Sooners 
probably will retake the top spot today in this week's Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
"We volunteered last week," Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs said. "Any time you need 
us for No. 1, we'll do it. Someone's got to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona became the third straight top-ranked team to lose in its first week as 
No. 1. Oklahoma and Illinois did it previously. 
</P>
<P>
So are the Sooners the country's best team? 
</P>
<P>
"When you really got down to it, and I had to be fair, I'd probably put us in 
there," Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
In beating Arizona, Oklahoma won its 27th consecutive home game. Sean Elliott 
scored 26 points for Arizona (18-3), which had its 10-game winning streak 
snapped. 
</P>
<P>
King scored 17 of his 24 points in the second half and the Sooners made five 
free throws in the closing seconds. King scored seven of his team's first nine 
points, then didn't score again until 3:12 into the second half as Arizona's 
1-3-1 defense caused problems. When he finally did score again, it ended an 
11-0 run that had given the Wildcats a 44-37 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was played at the tempo we wanted," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. 
"In the first half we did a really good job on him (King), but great players, 
you can only control them awhile. That's why they're great players." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Sooners figured a way to get the ball inside, King did the rest. He 
scored six straight and 12 of Oklahoma's next 21 as the Sooners tied the score 
at 58 with 9:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"They switched defenses on us, and we kind of spread the court out and made 
them respect the outside shots," King said. "That opened the inside for me, and 
I got the ball and went to work." 
</P>
<P>
A 15-3 run by Oklahoma made the score 73-64 with 5:11 remaining. Skeeter Henry 
scored seven of his 15 points during that spurt. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who went nearly 8 minutes in the second half without scoring, pulled 
the Wildcats to 77-73 with a three-point shot with 1:44 left. The teams traded 
baskets, then Mookie Blaylock made a free throw with 33 seconds remaining to 
put the Sooners ahead, 78-75. 
</P>
<P>
Blaylock's second free throw bounced away, but William Davis got the offensive 
rebound and was fouled. He made both shots to make the score 80-75. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest play was our failure to rebound the missed free throw," Olson 
said. "That would have given us a chance to tie it with a three-pointer." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott made a jumper with 20 seconds left, but Blaylock came back 6 seconds 
later to make two free throws. Matt Othick made a three-pointer with 7 seconds 
left. 
</P>

Fixed-rate home mortgages are averaging 10.56%, according to a national survey 
by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That rate was up slightly from a rate 
of 10.55% last week. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking 
an average initial rate of 8.61% this week, up from 8.56% the week before, 
Freddie Mac said.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has charged former White House budget 
director Bert Lance and a Calhoun company with defaulting on loan payments to a 
now-defunct Tennessee bank. The U.S. District Court suit seeks $1.5 million 
from Lance and the Kris Co. It alleges that Lance and the company defaulted on 
payments to the United American Bank of Knoxville for four separate loans and 
renewal agreements dating to late 1981. The suit, filed in Rome, Ga., was made 
public Thursday after U.S. District Judge Harold L. Murphy denied a request by 
the government's lawyers to keep it secret for 20 days. Lance said he had not 
seen a copy of the suit. Lance declined to talk about the Kris Co, saying it 
was a "personal company."

Of the 3,032 thrifts in the country, 72% were profitable in the first nine 
months of 1988, but the staggering losses of the unhealthy institutions left 
the industry with a net loss of $4.5 billion in that period, thrift rating 
service Sheshunoff &amp; Co. reported. "The remaining 28% or 838 institutions 
were unprofitable," said Alex Sheshunoff, founder of the rating service. "Of 
the unprofitable S&amp;Ls, 315 were insolvent. Of the insolvent, 91 have been 
merged or closed by the regulators." He said the $4.1-billion profit generated 
by the healthy thrifts was offset by the unprofitable ones, which lost $8.6 
billion, creating a net loss of $4.5 billion for the industry.

Lumber production, orders and shipments decreased as the record-breaking cold 
wave engulfed 12 Western states last week, a trade association reported. The 
Western Wood Products Assn. reported lumber production of 307 million board 
feet, down 76 million feet from the previous week. The association reported 
orders for 342 million board feet, down 37 million feet from the previous week.

"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" and "Cinderella" aren't just big hits with 
children. They are the top-selling videos of any kind. The third best-selling 
video is Disney's "Lady and the Tramp," followed by Paramount's "Top Gun" and 
"Good Morning, Vietnam," by Disney's Touchstone unit, according to Video 
Marketing News.

How big were videocassettes in 1988? According to Paul Kagan Associates, 
consumers paid $1.5 billion last year for 95.5 million videocassettes. In 1987, 
consumers spent $1.1 billion to buy 64.9 million videocassettes. Measured in 
dollars, that's a 36% gain. The Carmel-based research firm predicts that 
consumers will spend $1.8 billion this year on 120 million videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Although videocassette sales are growing, the rental market is still much 
bigger. According to Paul Kagan Associates, consumers spent $6.4 billion last 
year to rent tapes -- four times what they spent to buy tapes. Rental spending 
was up 23% last year, from $5.2 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue that studios make on each videocassette has dropped. Paul Kagan 
Associates estimates that the videocassette producers took in $10.75 last year 
for each cassette sold to consumers, compared to $11.50 in 1987. The research 
firm predicts that revenue will fall this year to $10.30 per tape. DENISE

TRANSPORTATION INDEX JUST SHY OF RECORD;

<TEXT>
<P>
While many stocks have prospered in the market rally of the past three months, 
few groups have gone farther and faster than airline issues. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks like Delta, UAL, AMR, NWA, Alaska Air and Southwest have all traded 
lately at their highest levels in at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, those six are all components of the Dow Jones average of 20 
transportation stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation average, unlike many other market indicators, has recently 
come close to recouping all ground lost in the market decline of August through 
December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the index closed at 1,087.97, shy of its all-time closing high of 
1,101.16 reached at the peak of the bull market in 1987, notes William LeFevre, 
an analyst at Advest Inc. Three consecutive losses left it at 1,059.99 by the 
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
In Wall Street's view at least, the recent gains would seem to suggest that the 
industry has begun to emerge from a long, turbulent period of adjustment to 
deregulation and may be headed for smoother sailing. 
</P>
<P>
During 1988, "everything that could possibly go right did," said Helane Becker, 
an analyst who follows the airline industry for Shearson Lehman Hutton. "The 
airlines had one of their best ever years." 
</P>
<P>
Pretax industry earnings grew 18%, she estimated in a recent report, on a 12% 
gain in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"The likelihood of the profitability continuing into 1989 is, in our opinion, 
quite high," she added, "although the percent changes will probably not be as 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
In its appraisal of 91 industry groups for their likely stock price performance 
over the next 12 months, the Value Line Investment Survey ranks the air 
transport group a lofty ninth. 
</P>
<P>
All this has caught some investors off guard, since they have grown used to 
thinking of airline stocks as a kind of commodity, like gold or soybeans, best 
suited for short-term trading strategies rather than long-term holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Two prime forces affecting most airline stocks have been developments in the 
industry's sporadic passenger fare wars and fluctuations in the price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Traders looked for falling oil prices (translated to read "lower jet fuel 
costs") or indications of a letup in fare competition as a cue to take airline 
stocks for a quick ride. 
</P>
<P>
Promotional air fares aren't likely to disappear, Becker acknowledged. 
"However," she said, "we think that, overall, air fares will remain relatively 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
"This should lead to better predictability of earnings. Consequently, we think 
airline company equities will become more than trading vehicles: They are 
likely to become investments." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the industry's bright picture, Value Line analysts caution that some 
new clouds may be forming on the horizon. They say U.S. airlines may be 
confronted with increased competition from abroad in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Once members of the European Community fulfill plans to form a single, unified 
marketplace by 1992, Value Line says, European airlines may well seek and gain 
the right to fly routes within the United States, as some American carriers now 
do between destinations in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
That competition could be especially formidable, the advisory service observes, 
because of the reputation for good service that many European carriers enjoy.

COMPUTER LINK WITH SOVIETS SPARKS MIXED FEELINGS

Gregg Maryniak used to wait up to six weeks for an answer when he wrote letters 
to Soviet scientists with whom he is working on space technology issues. Now he 
just bangs a message into his computer at the Space Studies Institute in 
Princeton, N.J., and sends it off by electronic mail. A satellite carries it to 
Moscow almost instantly. 
</P>
<P>
As communications technology advances and international tensions abate, the 
flow of electronic data between the United States and the Soviet Union is 
quickening. Soviet computer buffs talk with American counterparts using 
electronic "bulletin boards." U.S. companies keep in touch with their Moscow 
offices by computer. 
</P>
<P>
While it is a welcome sign of greater trust between the world's two 
superpowers, the increased data exchange is raising concerns among some U.S. 
government agencies and security experts that such exchanges may open doors 
that would be better closed. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that such communications could ease access by the Soviets to U.S. 
databases in which sophisticated technical information is stored or become a 
conduit by which spies would send information out. Or, it could make computers 
here more vulnerable to sabotage through the introduction of "viruses." 
</P>
<P>
A recent National Academy of Sciences report raises such concerns, saying the 
proliferation of global networks increases the "means to export 'soft' 
technologies . . . that may be outside the reach of current control 
mechanisms." Unlike computers, which can be easily seen, "soft" technologies 
such as computer software, reports, formulas and other "know-how" are harder to 
track. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Technology Improved 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon spokeswoman said the easier ties raise "national security concerns" 
but refused to elaborate on how the government was reacting to that concern. 
</P>
<P>
Direct computer-to-computer links have been possible for years between the 
United States and the Soviet Union. But the poor quality of Soviet phone lines 
and the complicated series of international links required to connect the two 
countries made the contacts cumbersome and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, however, improved telecommunications lines and the addition of a 
direct satellite link are making such hookups easier. To many that is an 
entirely welcome development, fostering international understanding on a 
person-to-person level and facilitating research and trade. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, one of the most enthusiastic new communicators is John 
Draper, who earned fame masquerading under the name "Cap'n Crunch" and busting 
into the U.S. phone system in the 1970s. Draper, who served a jail term for his 
tinkerings, returned from a trip to the Soviet Union last year and immediately 
urged fellow computer hackers in America to send messages to their Soviet 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
"Ask anything about computers," he advised them, but "don't call them 
Russians." 
</P>
<P>
Draper's enthusiasm aside, Soviet society is a long way from nurturing a hacker 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Access to computers and modems is strictly limited, and so far the high cost of 
international communications links puts electronic access to the United States 
out of reach of all but a handful of computer enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, one of the few Soviets with access to a computer and networks, 
Alex Yegorov, sent an electronic mail message to Draper: "It is Sunday over 
here, and I told myself not to get up from my PC before putting through your 
'Gateway' as much vivid impressions to our American friends as I would manage." 
</P>
<P>
He went on: "A cup of coffee is in front of me ready to be spilt on the 
keyboard in case it takes fire, a pack of cigarettes, Winston this time, (How 
much would they pay me for free advertising?) and a roll of all your messages 
filling all the available table space. My wife and my kid are still asleep -- 
it's 7 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Such communiques seem harmless enough, but some U.S. officials worry that 
innocent messages can turn into more serious and potentially damaging 
exchanges. Indeed, the new technology simply adds a new twist to the well-known 
tension between nurturing free and open communications and protecting national 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since public databases came on line in the United States, storing 
everything from stock prices to medical literature, they've been almost as open 
as the public library. For anyone with a computer and a modem, access to vast 
storehouses of data is just a phone call away. 
</P>
<P>
No one is suggesting that this policy change. In fact, the last government hint 
at monitoring the use of databases, contained in a 1986 memorandum by John 
Poindexter, then national security adviser, met with a storm of protest. No one 
has dared mention the idea since. Unlike public databases, electronic 
storehouses of classified military information are presumably secure enough 
that no unauthorized user -- American or foreign -- can tap into them. 
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern to officials is just how to monitor the growing 
international network traffic. As more citizens hook up, it becomes more 
difficult to keep track of what's being shipped and who's doing the shipping. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be that difficult to "put the plans for your next microchip and 
ship it through a network," said Seymour Goodman, a University of Arizona 
professor who chaired the National Academy of Sciences committee that looked at 
the subject. "If there are more orifices for this electronic shipment, it makes 
it easier than if you have to take microphotos and smuggle them out the old 
way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Easy to Monitor 
</P>
<P>
Some disagree, saying the new direct links to the Soviet Union make it easier 
than ever to track the flow of information. 
</P>
<P>
Maryniak, of the Princeton center, believes that data links are easily 
monitored by government agencies. "You might as well write the message on a 
postcard and send it through both postal systems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Princeton and other sites, the computer links are designed to give the 
Soviets access only to what Americans at this end send them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not talking to our computers. They're only talking to our mail drop," 
said Les Cottrell, of Stanford University's Linear Accelerator Center. "They 
can't hack into our computers. They can't put worms or viruses into our 
computers. They can't drag any information out of our computers." 
</P>
<P>
As the pace of technological change steps up in the United States and the 
Soviet Union, the questions about information sharing are likely to grow more 
complex. One official, for example, looks toward a proposed coast-to-coast U.S. 
supercomputer network that is intended to give thousands of researchers access 
to the computational power of America's largest computers. 
</P>
<P>
Would that include Soviet researchers? 
</P>
<P>
Said Michael Michaud, director of the State Department office of advanced 
technology: "We need to look at the implications."

The circumstances of Billy Sipple's death came as no surprise to his friends. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime around Jan. 19, Sipple turned on his television and lay on his bed, 
half-gallon bottles of cheap bourbon and 7-Up within reach, and fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Wayne Friday stopped by Reflections, a Polk Street bar that 
was one of Sipple's daily stops. The bartender, worried that Sipple had not 
been by for days, asked Friday to check up on him. 
</P>
<P>
Without even opening the door of Sipple's apartment, Friday, an investigator 
for the San Francisco District Attorney, knew that his friend was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't die like that, alone," Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Littered With Mementos 
</P>
<P>
Sipple's $334-a month apartment looked like a junk store gone to seed. Mementos 
of value only to their owner were arranged in no order. Bad paintings covered 
chipped plaster. His most prized possession, a framed letter, hung on a corner 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Mr. Sipple," the letter began. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to know how much I appreciated your selfless actions last Monday. 
The events were a shock to us all, but you acted quickly and without fear for 
your own safety. By doing so, you helped to avert danger to me and to others in 
the crowd. You have my heartfelt appreciation." 
</P>
<P>
Signed, Jerry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was dated Sept. 25, 1975. Three days earlier, Oliver (Billy) Sipple, 
a disabled Vietnam Marine veteran, happened to be at Union Square when Sara 
Jane Moore aimed a .38 caliber revolver at then-President Gerald Ford. Sipple 
lunged and knocked away the gun. The bullet went wild. The President was 
whisked away, safely. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone would have done the same thing, Sipple told his friends. It was no big 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
Others saw it differently. Not only was he a hero, he was gay, and actively 
involved in gay politics and in causes -- a fact known widely here but not 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco in 1975, gays were seeking political power -- and there were 
many who thought Sipple's heroic act could go a long way toward dispelling 
myths and stereotypes about gays here and across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple was about to become famous. In the process, he would suffer. His story 
was news, but it forever estranged him from his parents. He knew he had 
problems before the fame but he also maintained that the problems became far 
worse after: he became more nervous, drank more, considered suicide and thought 
people were following him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right to Privacy 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of stress and I take it out on booze," he said in a 1979 
deposition, describing what his flash of fame had brought. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple's story is retold in journalism schools and discussions about the right 
to privacy. There was even mention of it in the movie, "Absence of Malice." The 
reporter portrayed by Sally Field wrote a story that prompted the subject to 
commit suicide. The editor tried to console her by telling about "the guy in 
the crowd" who "saved the President's life." 
</P>
<P>
"Turned out he was also gay. That's news, right? Now the whole country knows 
that too," the editor in the movie said. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Sipple died of natural causes, according to a coroner's spokeswoman, 
although the exact cause of death remains unknown. But his friends say he had 
been suffering from pneumonia. He had a pacemaker and had ballooned to 298 
pounds, long ago losing his square-jawed good looks. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple was 47, but many believed him when, for some reason, he announced that 
he was 59 at a birthday party he threw for himself at Reflections three months 
ago -- and said it would be his last. 
</P>
<P>
About two weeks before his body was discovered, Sipple stopped in at the New 
Bell Saloon where he told bartender Frank Hagan that he had been by the 
Veterans Administration hospital, but was told to go home. A hospital spokesman 
said no record exists of such a visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a doctor, but I could tell he couldn't breathe," Hagan said. The 
bartender called him a cab and told him to phone a doctor when he got home. 
Sipple promised he would. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that was the last anyone saw him," Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy died in pain, with a bottle by his bed. That's pain. That's need for 
anesthetic," John Wahl said after Sipple's funeral, a simple affair last week 
attended by 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
Wahl was the lawyer who brought an unsuccessful invasion-of-privacy suit on 
Sipple's behalf against several newspapers, among them The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1975, another client of Wahl's, political activist Harvey Milk, a 
long-time friend of Sipple's, was making a name for himself by making a serious 
run for the Board of Supervisors, trying to organize gays and urging that they 
emerge from their closets. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill was part of that outreach. He was a guy who would do anything we asked -- 
cook, walk precincts," recalled Bob Ross, publisher of the weekly Bay Area 
Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
"Harvey's whole attitude was to show people that not everyone who was gay runs 
around with lipstick, high heels and a dress," Ross said. Sipple, the 
ex-Marine, seemed the perfect one to break down the myths. "This was an 
ordinary American citizen, and he was a gay man." 
</P>
<P>
The first press mention of Sipple's sexual orientation appeared on Sept. 24, 
1975, two days after the attempt on Ford's life. San Francisco Chronicle 
columnist Herb Caen reported that Milk and another gay man "who claim to be 
among Sipple's close friends, describe themselves as 'proud -- maybe this will 
help break the stereotype.' " The item also noted that Sipple worked in Milk's 
supervisorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"In the gay press," recalled Ross, "we were happy to have a hero." 
</P>
<P>
But there was a problem. "Bill didn't want to be a hero," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the item appeared in Caen's column, the ramifications of Sipple's 
sexuality added a new twist for other reporters. When President Ford did not 
immediately thank Sipple, Milk told reporters that Sipple was being ignored 
because he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sipple was evasive when reporters called. When headlines about his 
homosexuality reached his hometown of Detroit, the reason for Sipple's 
reluctance became apparent. His parents were shocked that he was being called a 
prominent member of San Francisco's gay community. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was too old, too stubborn. He couldn't change," said George Sipple, 
Bill's brother, a Detroit auto worker who came to San Francisco to arrange 
Bill's burial and clean his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The estrangement between Sipple and his father was so deep that when his mother 
died in 1979, his father made it clear that he was not welcome. He could go to 
the funeral home or the cemetery, but not when his father was there, George 
Sipple recalled. Sipple stayed in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"His personal life never should have made it back to Detroit," Sipple's brother 
added. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after he grabbed Moore, Sipple rarely discussed the incident, and 
downplayed his role when he did. He told his brother that he wasn't even 
thinking about the President when he grabbed the would-be assassin. He thought 
that for some reason she was going to shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, however, several of his friends would say that when the 
liquor got him to talking, Sipple would boast about his heroism and inflate his 
service rank, telling people who would listen that he retired as a Marine 
colonel. The highest rank he attained was corporal. He was discharged as a 
private first-class. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sipple believed his notoriety led him to drink more heavily and ruined 
his life, his life apparently had long been troubled. 
</P>
<P>
He was a high-school drop-out, dyslexic and had been a drinker for years, he 
said. He was wounded twice in Vietnam, including once in the head, and lived on 
a 100% veteran's disability pension since his release from the Marines in 1970. 
The disability was for both psychological and physical reasons. The coroner's 
report noted that he was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
But although he lived on a veteran's pension, he never stopped being generous, 
his friends said. He would give at least $50 to any worthy charity, or help a 
Tenderloin derelict. 
</P>
<P>
"I have watched him split his last two dollars. Give one dollar to someone who 
needed a meal, and use the rest to buy himself a drink," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Sipple had come to San Francisco in 1970 knowing that he would be accepted as 
he never could be back home. But he never envisioned that word of his life 
style would travel back to his hometown, attorney Wahl said in explaining why 
Sipple decided to file suit after the publicity that followed his act of 
heroism. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a principle," Wahl said. "If someone is gay and wants to keep that 
fact private, then who the hell is Herb Caen or anyone else to say it's not a 
private fact?" 
</P>
<P>
Sipple's suit was thrown out by a superior court judge in San Francisco. The 
case dragged on until 1984 when a state court of appeal held that Sipple had 
indeed become news, and that his sexual orientation was part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
Although the papers won the suit, the Sipple story weighs on Daryl Lembke, then 
a reporter for The Times whose article was among the first to appear after 
Caen's column item. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a source of concern that will stay with me -- that I attempted to make 
Oliver Sipple a gay hero," Lembke said. "Instead, I helped estrange him from 
his mother. . . . If I had it to do it over again, I wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Caen doesn't have such second thoughts. In a brief phone conversation, he said: 
"It was a good item. Members of the gay community wanted it published to show 
they weren't all a bunch of wimps." 
</P>
<P>
Sipple nonetheless left a mark and that pleased him, said George Sipple, taking 
a break from cleaning his brother's apartment. George recalled that his brother 
once said that long after he died, "somebody will pick up a book and see Oliver 
Sipple saved President Ford's life." 
</P>
<P>
George Sipple felt sorry, however, that he could not honor his brother's wish 
that he be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He was buried Wednesday at 
Golden Gate National Cemetery south of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
His brother also wondered why there had been no message of condolence from 
former President Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Circle, Ford's chief of staff at his Palm Springs office, said the former 
President had been traveling since she learned of Sipple's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't get a hold of the President," she said, "and it just fell through 
the cracks."

CAST AND FANS TOAST 'GWTW' ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Compared to the 1939 Atlanta premiere of "Gone With the Wind" -- when Georgia's 
governor declared a three-day holiday and stars such as Clark Gable and Vivien 
Leigh swept in by train to attend all-night balls -- the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art's 50th anniversary celebration of the film was a modest affair. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 10 of the original cast of more than 60 are still alive, and most of 
the survivors turned out. Instead of dances and Mardi Gras-style parades, the 
celebrants Saturday night were content to eat jambalaya and sip mint juleps 
under heat lamps inside a courtyard on Wilshire Boulevard. The hit of the event 
were nine Pennsylvania housewives who arrived wearing exact replicas of 
Scarlett O'Hara's dresses. 
</P>
<P>
But the stories shared by some of the film's survivors, at the celebration and 
in interviews last week, evoked the memories of that 1939 premiere, probably 
the most eagerly awaited in American film history. Their anecdotes restore as 
much luster to the film as Turner Entertainment's lab technicians, who 
painstakingly re-created the movie's fading colors and sound track in the 1950s 
print screened Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The survivors talked about Leigh's last-minute success in securing the most 
coveted role in Hollywood at that time, that of Scarlett O'Hara, and the 
British actress' slavish devotion to the film's first director, George Cukor. 
They talked about Gable's almost casual attitude toward the film -- the 
opposite demeanor of his co-star -- and his annoyance at Cukor's concentration 
on the female characters. After filming was well under way, producer David O. 
Selznick fired Cukor and brought in Victor Fleming, a man's man and a good 
buddy of Gable's. 
</P>
<P>
"Both women (Leigh and Olivia de Havilland) were bereft when Cukor left," 
recalled Ann Rutherford, 71, who played Scarlett's sister Careen. "They went to 
his house at night (after Fleming replaced him). He would feed them a light 
dinner and rehearse them until they were brainless. . . . If not for Cukor, I 
doubt that you would have seen those hair-raising performances from these 
women." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Crane, who played one of the Tarleton twins, was so young and naive when 
he landed his part in "Gone With the Wind," his first film, that he caught 
himself calling the director "Mr. Zukor." Crane, 70, later left the movies and 
went into broadcasting, where he was a regular radio personality on KFAC. Rand 
Brooks, who played the smitten Charles Hamilton, Scarlett's first husband, 
hated his part so much that he voted for "Of Mice and Men" in the Academy Award 
race that year. "It was an asinine role," he said. "That role hurt me in some 
ways, it sort of typecast me after that." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks, 70, turned out for the reception, but he said he didn't intend to sit 
through the entire screening. "I'm the biggest laugh in the show -- maybe 
Butterfly gets more -- and that hurts," said Brooks, who left show business 23 
years ago to run a private ambulance company. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfly McQueen wasn't thrilled about her character, either. "Prissy is 
stupid and backward and lazy, " said McQueen, whose voice is still just as 
high-pitched as the teen-age slave she portrayed. But the role has garnered 
McQueen plenty of public attention at every "Gone With the Wind" anniversary. 
The 78-year-old actress arrived at Saturday's event passing out pre-written 
autographs from a manila envelope, and received a standing ovation before the 
screening. 
</P>
<P>
But as the survivors of "Gone With the Wind" talk about themselves and their 
colleagues on the set, the conversation somehow always circles back to one man 
-- the obsessive, arrogant, brilliant perfectionist David O. Selznick. 
</P>
<P>
"I was crazy about him," said Brooks. "But he drove some people crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make 'em like that anymore," he added, a bit wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
"This was Selznick's baby," said Rutherford. "His word was law, and woe betide 
any actor who interjected an extra if, and, or but." 
</P>
<P>
When Selznick appeared one day in the wardrobe room, Rutherford thought she was 
doing the producer a favor when she lifted her skirt and suggested that muslin 
petticoats would serve just as well as the expensive lace she was wearing under 
her Southern Belle dress. 
</P>
<P>
Selznick wasn't impressed. "He fixed his beady eyes on me," she recalled, "and 
said, 'You are not to forget that you are the daughter of one of the richest 
plantation owners in Georgia.' " 
</P>
<P>
At another point during the filming, a Selznick assistant picked up Rutherford 
and Evelyn Keyes, who played Scarlett's other sister Suellen, at 3 in the 
morning and drove them to a cotton field 40 miles east of Hollywood. The women 
were told to start picking. When Rutherford asked why, she was told that 
Selznick "wants your hands to be thoroughly bitten up" by the time the scene 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
Selznick's memos were legendary, and Rutherford is proud to say that she 
prompted one of them. The young actress cornered Selznick on a train and 
insisted that the women in the film had to let their eye-brows grow in. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's description of "the raven-wing sweep of Scarlett's eye-brows," said 
Rutherford, was in danger because the studios routinely altered their 
actresses' natural looks, which inevitably included a severe eyebrow plucking. 
</P>
<P>
A minor detail, perhaps. But just the sort to provoke a flurry of paper from 
Selznick's office. 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said she sees red every time she hears talk of a remake of "Gone 
With the Wind." "If it's not broken, don't fix it," she said. Judging by the 
enthusiastic response of Saturday's audience, the film fans seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Goya, a Rembrandt," Crane said dramatically in his best radio voice. 
"It has the ineffable essence of something that's going to live forever."

AN ESSAY BY BOB BAKER;

QUESTIONS FOR A DEMON WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, Baker is a Times staff writer who has reported extensively on 
events in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What burns inside us? Why can't we watch the Big Spin without somebody 
alongside us commenting dourly about the number of Spanish-speaking winners? 
Why can't we watch a professional basketball game without someone alongside us 
feeling obligated to mention that everyone on the court is black? Why, after so 
many painful decades of introspection about prejudice and racism and 
discrimination, does the awful self-consciousness remain? 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't it supposed to eventually dissipate, this awareness of skin color and 
the monstrous little acts it produces? Wasn't there eventually supposed to be a 
generation so sensitized to the evils of discrimination that it would train 
itself to stamp out the demon inside all souls that finds something wrong in 
all that is different? Wasn't Los Angeles -- the new Ellis Island, teeming with 
so many racial and ethnic cross-currents, so many new faces, so many people 
starting over -- supposed to become the kind of place where the old demon died, 
where it was harder to be racially conscious because there were so many races? 
</P>
<P>
Not yet. The demon lives. It lurks in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
In the civil rights era everyone knew what discrimination was. It was being 
refused lunch or a job or a ballot. It was black and white because it was 
written in black and white. Now it is written, with equal force, that there can 
be no discrimination, not for any reason, and we take comfort in the knowledge 
that much of the discrimination has died. 
</P>
<P>
Our comfort blinds us to the fact that much of the prejudice that fueled the 
discrimination of old lives on. We have made it easier to ignore the fact that 
hatred continues to percolate from generation to generation, flaring like an 
evil genie. 
</P>
<P>
An Arab-American businessman finds racial graffiti on his building. A UCLA 
teacher of Chinese descent walking on campus hears two white male students yell 
a racial epithet at her and tell her, "Go home!" A Jewish teen-ager who asks 
other boys why they wear the symbol of a fish to proclaim their Christianity is 
ridiculed and showered with pennies. 
</P>
<P>
It happens, a handful of acts of overt violence but mostly defacement and 
insults. We tell ourselves it does not happen often enough to be regarded as a 
social problem. After all, how often do we see these sorts of things? They are 
rarely reported to police or to the county Human Relations Commission, which 
each year releases a report of perhaps 200 incidents of racial and religious 
vandalism and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Isolated incidents, we tell ourselves. Anecdotes, not stuff of a pattern. Amid 
all the non-racial violence that confronts Los Angeles, discrimination seems 
trifling. After all, no one is being lynched. How concerned must we be? Look at 
what passes for racism these days, we tell ourself. Does it matter -- does it 
truly matter -- if a few feelings are hurt because the winning entry at a Long 
Beach sand sculpture contest features a caricature of a grinning Chinese man 
emerging from the other side of the Earth, with the title, "Wrong Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it matters. 
</P>
<P>
It matters because each tiny abrasion that we produce as we rub against people 
of different backgrounds is an unrepairable tear in the fabric of society. It 
matters because each incident gives implicit permission for another to follow. 
It matters because children hear these things and feel them, and the argument 
that no law has been broken by a racial joke or a racial slight does not make 
up for the spirit that has been broken. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination in Los Angeles in 1989 is not fire hoses in Selma, Ala., in 
1964. It is the woman speaking Chinese who cannot catch the right bus because 
the driver, pressured by a schedule to keep, just shakes his head and closes 
the door. It is the Mexican-American comedian who recognizes that his career 
depends on telling jokes that allow Anglo audiences to laugh at Latinos and 
confides that he sometimes feels like a guard at Auschwitz, just doing his job, 
a job that involves inadvertently tearing another small crack in the wall of 
racial dignity. It is a black woman who moves into a middle-class white 
neighborhood and is so conditioned to expect the worst that it takes her months 
to stop suspecting racists behind every shrub. It is the Asian teen-ager who 
has become philosophical beyond her years. "Like, America is mixed, right?" she 
asks rhetorically. "But I don't think it's going to be one nation. People don't 
try to be like one." 
</P>
<P>
Some people do. In one Los Angeles classroom, a Korean student from Paraguay 
gives answers in Spanish to a companion from El Salvador while a Romanian 
immigrant student asks a Mexican teacher's assistant how to say don't forget in 
Spanish. At a gas station, an Armenian man in oil-stained coveralls who prides 
himself on speaking not merely his native tongue but English, Spanish, Turkish, 
Farsi, French and Italian sees a Spanish-speaking woman approach him and asks 
in heavily Middle-Eastern-accented Spanish, "How may I help you?" 
</P>
<P>
The stories you are about to read are largely undramatic. Nobody dies. In a lot 
of cases, nobody even cries. Mostly they ache, and they wonder about life's 
cruelties, and they sigh and go on with their lives, each time a little more 
guardedly, each time a little more skeptically. They never forget the demon. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should any of us.

<P>
For more than 75 years the Anti-Defamation League has worked to eradicate 
prejudice. The struggle has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics cannot begin to measure the continuing impact of bigotry, but they 
are distressing. Recent reports indicate a marked rise in acts of violence 
directed at minorities, Jews, gays and others perceived as different. The ADL 
has issued three recent studies of the disturbing skinhead youth gangs -- 
adolescents espousing an ideology of hate and acting out their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, the effort to reduce prejudice must increase. The 
Anti-Defamation League has initiated a campaign involving the media, the 
corporate world and the educational community in a joint effort to reduce 
prejudice and stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
This Los Angeles Times supplement is one aspect of the "A World of Difference" 
campaign. Work by KCBS-TV, the Milken Family Foundation, the Southern 
California Human Relations Coalition and the James Irvine Foundation will 
ensure that by the end of 1989 our community will have a greater understanding 
for the rich diversity that has become Southern California. DAVID A. LEHRER, 
Regional Director

Racial, ethnic and religious discrimination can be found in every facet of 
American life, from the corporate board room to the school playground. Yet, it 
is one of those topics that people do not like to discuss. Hate is difficult to 
measure. Unless it boils over into a publicly ugly act, it goes largely 
uncharted. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a measure, it is difficult to spotlight ways to eliminate 
discrimination. This report illuminates divergent viewpoints from multi-ethnic 
Southern California and is guide for those looking for how to combat bias. 
</P>
<P>
The report was planned in conjunction with an effort by the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith to raise awareness in Southern California of racial, 
ethnic and religious discrimination. The campaign, called "A World of 
Difference," has been launched in Detroit, Boston, San Francisco and New York 
City. In some of the communities, the drive has led to school and community 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
You'll hear a lot about this yearlong campaign -- through special programming 
on KCBS-TV, through corporate-sponsored publicity drives, through church and 
synagogue events -- about our sensitivities and insensitivities. If the year is 
successful, we will take a second look at the textbooks our children use in 
school, at the kind of language we use, at the need to expand our knowledge to 
understand how and why groups other than our own might react as they do. 
</P>
<P>
There also are things you will not hear in this section and in the campaign. 
The ADL has designed its campaign around problems of race, religion and ethnic 
background. The ADL acknowledges that there are other serious discrimination 
problems -- affecting women, homosexuals, older people, people with 
disabilities. But because of limited resources, the ADL decided to limit its 
scope hoping that its campaign should be a starting point. 
</P>
<P>
So this section has accepted those limitations, with the knowledge that there 
are plenty of problems where these came from. 
</P>

Copies of this report are available on a limited basis from The Times public 
relations department at (213) 237-5782. For those who want to get involved in 
the ADL's World of Difference project, contact Janet Himler, campaign 
coordinator, at (213) 655-8205.

AFTER 5 YEARS, DAWN CHUN FINDS LIFE EASIER, BUT STILL SEES A GULF OF SEPARATION

Dawn Chun, 16, is a junior at Belmont High School in Los Angeles. Born in 
Seoul, she immigrated to the United States with her family in 1983. In her 
nearly five years in America, she has attended four public schools. Here, she 
talks about what it was like to be a newcomer plunging into a foreign culture, 
knowing little English and having no friends. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the first day of school. This little girl came up to me and asked, 
"What's your name?" I knew what she meant. So I said Dawn. And then she said, 
"What?" and I had to spell it out. Then she said, "What is your last name?" I 
didn't know what that meant, last name. It was so embarrassing. I couldn't 
answer her. It was this little kid, a blond girl. I couldn't answer her. So she 
left. 
</P>
<P>
My first friends were Koreans. When you don't speak any other language, you 
tend to find who is your nationality and you tend to be friends with them. 
</P>
<P>
One friend, she didn't speak much English, either. She just came (to America), 
like me. The other girl spoke English fluently. I think she was born here. When 
her dad asked her to help me out in school, she tried, but I guess it was hard 
for her. She didn't want to hang out with me because I didn't speak any 
English. She wanted to be with her friends because they spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
In school, when someone would ask her, "Are you Korean?" she would say, "No, 
I'm American. I'm not Korean." I didn't like that. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, I say I'm Korean. Maybe if I stay here longer I'll say I'm 
Korean-American. 
</P>
<P>
I like Korean culture because you respect the elders, not like in America. When 
you say bye or hi to an elder, you have to bow your heads. I still do that to 
Korean adults. I did that to my elementary schoolteacher, too, when I first 
came here. I didn't know you could just go "Bye!" and leave. So the teacher 
said bye, and I bowed my head and said bye like that. When I got out of school, 
I was so embarrassed. I found out that's weird, to bow your head. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I don't hang out with Koreans. I don't know why. I hang out with one 
Chinese and one Vietnamese girl. They've been here (in America) for seven or 
eight years. There are not that many Koreans here. There are a lot of 
Hispanics. Orientals are a minority. 
</P>
<P>
Hispanics here get more advantages because they are the major group. Like those 
papers they pass out (notices for parents), one side is in English and one side 
in Spanish. Other people, from Asia, they don't always get those things. They 
don't know what is going on. Maybe there is a shortened day, and they don't 
know it. That happened to me when I was in junior high. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in junior high school, all the (newly arrived) Korean kids would 
hang out in the cafeteria. And there was a Ping-Pong table, and all the Asian 
kids would hang out there. All the Hispanic kids would hang out upstairs where 
the lunch area is. Here, they hang out in libraries or outside somewhere. One 
group is in the library all the time. They want to hang out in an isolated 
area. 
</P>
<P>
When I first came here, I was afraid because I was so small and all these kids 
were so tall. I felt safer when I was just by myself, far away from people. 
Then when I got to speak more English and had a lot of friends, I started to go 
out, walk around the campus, say "Hi" to friends. 
</P>
<P>
I feel there are a lot of groups . . . a lot of separation, even here. 
</P>
<P>
All the groups make fun of each other. I don't understand that. Hispanics tend 
to call Asians Chino. It's not a bad word, but it sounds like a bad word. They 
call me Chino. I get mad at that because I'm not Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Us, too, Asians, we call Hispanic people (names). Like they're lazy, they don't 
do their work, they have brains but they don't use it. Hispanic people (say) 
all Asian people . . . drive too slow and they're nerds. They go, "People with 
glasses are smart." That's not true. Maybe they need glasses because they watch 
too much TV. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't seen fights at this school. But my friends told me about a lot of 
fights at their school. Like there are fights every Friday -- Vietnamese 
against Korean, Korean against Mexicans, Mexicans against Vietnamese. I don't 
think they ever fight (each other), like Mexicans against Mexicans, except in 
gangs. They fight other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
I think people don't understand each other. They don't want to get another 
person's culture. They only want their own. They don't want to mix together. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes that bothers me. Like America is mixed, right? But I don't think it's 
going be one nation. People don't try to be like one. 
</P>
<P>
I learned about the melting pot in history class. It was interesting. Then I 
learned there's another (idea) called salad bowl. The teacher asked us, "Which 
one do you think America is now?" I feel it's a salad bowl, not a melting pot.

PUTTING 'X' INTO XMAS: A MORE SENSITIVE APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I know the feelings undoubtedly are well-intentioned, but here's a modest 
proposal for Christmas celebrations that start earlier and earlier each year, 
that appear in more of our institutions each year: Keep them to those who want 
to celebrate the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
From a Jewish point of view (probably a Buddhist or Muslim point of view, too), 
America has no faster, more effective way of telling some of us that we are 
different, that we are supposed to belong where we do not. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond commercialism, beyond the obvious seasonal appeals to peace and good 
will, Christmas is a fundamental religious event. Promoting it as a secular, 
American holiday is not only insensitive, it is wrong. Worse is taking the 
relatively unimportant coincidental Jewish holiday of Hanukkah and elevating it 
to the importance of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
For many American Jews, Christmas has become a symbol, a kind of acid test of 
belonging or not belonging in a Christian mainstream. It becomes exaggerated as 
the Christmas season stretches earlier and longer into the year. 
</P>
<P>
One reason I live in Southern California is that my children in fact will be 
able to grow up in an area that has Jews and Jewish institutions among its mix 
of ethnicities. It's different from North Providence, R.I., where I was the 
only Jew in my high school. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is a melting pot where many teachers try to be sensitive to 
the mixed backgrounds of their students. Yet, these efforts often fall short 
and result in their own kind of alienation. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what happens in the elementary schools of West Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
The teacher uses both Christian and Jewish symbols in the art projects during 
December. On the last day of school before vacation, she singles out my 
daughter for having done good work and tells her she gets to take home the 
class Christmas tree. The child knows this is odd but cannot persuade the 
teacher that she should reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher tells her third graders to split up, all the Christian children on 
one side of the classroom, all the Jews on the other. She wants to distribute 
the appropriate packet of art materials for a project. What of those children 
who are neither? What of those children whose parents are of more than one 
faith? 
</P>
<P>
At the annual holiday party (Why is there always a holiday party?), the parent 
exhorts the students to greater enthusiasm for the requisite Hanukkah song 
added to "balance" the classroom caroling. You have to really get into it, sing 
and dance like the Jews do, the students are told. My son rolls his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents are relatively harmless, but there always seem to be incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing an authority announce that Jews must line up separately from everyone 
else sends chills. It is a reminder that even here, even in Los Angeles in 
1989, we are viewed as different. 
</P>
<P>
Being treated as "different" is never far away for us. My mother was locked up 
for several years as a prisoner of war only because she was a Jew. A 
significant portion of my family was killed during the Holocaust. My father was 
the first Jew to be hired to the college faculty where he once taught. 
</P>
<P>
Why do public schools have to depend on the symbols of Christmas? Why does my 
employer have to put Christmas trees throughout the building? Why does the 
President have to light the "national Christmas tree" on the White House lawn? 
</P>
<P>
If it is important to have Christmas in the schools, let's treat it for what it 
is, and organize the curriculum around discussion about the meaning of the 
holiday to those who celebrate it. Easter is not about bunnies; it is about 
what many recognize as the resurrection of a divine figure. 
</P>
<P>
My home state gave us the creche case, the continuing dispute over whether it 
is right to place clearly religious symbols on public land. What is most 
troubling is not the decision made by the officials of Pawtucket, R.I., but the 
idea that there never was any question about whether it might offend. 
</P>
<P>
So the proposal is this: You celebrate, and I'll take pleasure in the idea that 
you are celebrating. But, please don't make me feel as if I must join you.

Living as a Jew in Southern California has become acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Our Jewish community -- second largest in the nation -- includes South African 
Jews, Iranian Jews, Israeli Jews, Soviet Jews as well as those who have been 
here for a while. The community includes a spectrum on matters of religious 
observance and ethnic identification. 
</P>
<P>
Jews may never decide whether they are a "religion," an "ethnic group" or a 
"cultural nation," but a flock of books and studies show that Jews are 
succeeding as never before in American society. Most of the obvious hurdles 
have fallen; anti-Jewish sentiment is a lot less obvious than it was for the 
previous generations. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Jewish college quotas have largely disappeared (although affirmative 
action programs for minorities sometimes are perceived as exclusionary); hotels 
and home sales are no longer outwardly restricted to Jews; in business, there 
are some Jewish heads of top corporations. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, parents still tell their children that in Southern California, 1989, 
there is something that bothers the notion of tranquility. Parents still feel 
they must explain that there has been anti-Semitism for the 5,000 years that 
there have been Jews, that it has taken on a variety of faces and forms and 
degrees of virulence. Parents feel they must teach children how to deal with an 
ever-present sense of unease that anti-Semitism is right around the corner: 
</P>
<P>
On the multi-ethnic campus of UCLA, the offices of the Jewish student 
newspaper, housed by the black and Latino papers, are burned, and there is 
anti-Jewish sloganeering. 
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith reports the number of synagogue 
defacements and other anti-Semitic acts on the rise in Southern California and 
has warned of the emerging white-power skinhead movement. 
</P>
<P>
The aborted race for mayor of Los Angeles between Tom Bradley and Zev 
Yaroslavsky was seen in both the Jewish and black communities as something that 
might flare strained relations between the groups. Behind the scenes, black and 
Jewish clergy have been talking about ways to reduce strain that has surfaced 
occasionally over remarks by Jesse Jackson or Louis Farrakhan. Whatever might 
be said about success among Jews, the accepted truth among Jews, at least, is 
that there will be a black President of the United States long before any Jew 
will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
The strife in Israel has split feelings among Jews beyond questions of 
political and financial support. Israeli politics forced an argument between 
more orthodox-leaning Jews and more liberal Jews about some basic questions of 
identity, questions that draw an emotional response because they appear to make 
some Jews "better" than other Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Assimilation poses an almost unprecedented problem. Intermarriage, loss of 
identifiable ritual and a kind of popular rejection of organized religion of 
any sort are winnowing Jewish identity faster than any anti-Semitic campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Just what are we to make of anti-Semitism here and now? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a scientific question, and you're not going to get a scientific 
answer," said Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. 
"Anti-Semitism is definitely a topic when Jews get together and talk . . . But 
in our society the ultimate challenge is how to get Jews to look at 4,000 years 
of history, how to get people to relate positively to their Jewishness. 
</P>
<P>
"The option of walking away from our identity has never been easier to attain 
than in the U.S.A.," Cooper said.

BACKLASH AGAINST THE 'MODEL MINORITY';

ASIAN-AMERICANS FIND THEMSELVES RESISTING A 'DEMURE' STEREOTYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If there is any profession in which Asian-Americans seem to have made 
tremendous strides, it is engineering. Asian-Americans abound in such 
high-technology industries as aerospace, health care and electronics, leading 
many to label them as part of a "model minority." 
</P>
<P>
But talk to Asian-American engineers like Alice Lei and a story of frustration 
emerges. Lei, a Chinese-American engineer at McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, 
has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
contending racial discrimination against her involving her rank at the company. 
</P>
<P>
"They have certain stereotypes that (Asian women) are demure, not dynamic," Lei 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lei is not alone. A growing number of Asian-Americans like her contend that 
they are victims of systematic discrimination arising, ironically, from the 
popular image of Asian-Americans as a model minority. That image of Asians 
achieving success through quiet achievement -- while helping them to get hired 
at bottom and middle levels -- works against them in promotions to senior 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
White managers "feel Asians just want to do technical work so they leave them 
there and won't help train them" for management positions, said Stewart Kwoh, 
executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real big gap between the reality and the myth" of Asian-Americans as 
successful minorities, said Don T. Nakanishi, a UCLA assistant professor of 
education who has filed a grievance with the university claiming he was denied 
tenure there due in part to racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence indicates that at least some of the complaints may be justified. 
Asian-Americans make up 8% of all professionals and technicians in the private 
sector, but only 1.3% of all managers, according to the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded in a 
recent report that Asian-Americans are under-represented in managerial 
positions and called for further study of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, frustrated Asians in such industries as electronics and aerospace 
are leaving companies in growing numbers, moving to where they can start over 
again or form their own firms. A growing number of Asians are also filing -- 
and winning -- employment discrimination complaints against employers. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of discrimination based on the model minority stereotype is not 
limited to employment, Asian community leaders contend. Among other examples, 
they cite: 
</P>
<P>
* Asian-American students, because of their academic success and growing 
enrollments, have become victims of reverse quotas limiting their admission at 
some major universities. 
</P>
<P>
* Asian-American students are pushed into engineering and science -- and not 
social sciences or humanities -- by teachers who believe the stereotype that 
Asians are best-suited for technical professions and lack communication skills. 
</P>
<P>
* Asian-Americans are appointed to few policy-making positions in government 
despite their high level of campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
* Immigrants from Southeast Asia who have problems adjusting to American 
society receive limited government services and funding for language programs, 
immigration-adjustment services and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception is that Asians have made it so they don't need any assistance," 
Kwoh contended. "So it's very hard to convince (government officials or the 
media) that Asians have immigration problems or civil rights problems." 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is most evident in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Asian-American leaders contend that management under-representation is 
particularly noticeable in education, health care and engineering, where Asians 
have made inroads at entry levels. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Asians admit that they deserve part of the blame. Many Asians, 
through cultural upbringing or other factors, work hard but quietly and may 
also be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with office politics at white-owned 
corporations. And few are willing to file formal complaints or lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"Among groups of employees, Asians are the least active" in filing complaints, 
said Kent Wong, staff attorney for Local 660 of the Service Employees 
International Union, which represents 40,000 Los Angeles County public 
employees, of which about 10% are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
But that reluctance to speak up may be changing, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
He cites the case of Wallace Shishido and Tom Ohgi, two Los Angeles County 
health inspectors who claimed they were denied promotions because of race. 
Through filing a complaint in 1986 with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, Shishido was promoted. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Filipino-American public employees for Los Angeles County filed a 
class-action complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
alleging systematic discrimination against Filipinos in promotions, noted 
Cecile Ochoa, an equal employment opportunity investigator for the county who 
has filed a grievance alleging she was denied a promotion due in part to racial 
discrimination.

RESENTMENTS SPAWN ANTI-ASIAN-AMERICAN INSULTS AND VIOLENCE

Lucie Cheng has been a faculty member at UCLA for 18 years, but never had she 
experienced anything like this. She recalled that, while walking on campus 
recently, two white male students yelled a racial epithet at her and told her, 
"Go home!" 
</P>
<P>
Cheng, a sociology professor, noted that the taunts came amid growing incidents 
of anti-Asian graffiti on campus, perhaps sparked by resentments of Asians' 
growing numbers on campus and their academic success. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents have begun to occur even in neighborhoods generally considered 
racially liberal. Three Chinese-American businessmen, for example, recently 
fought with two whites in a Silver Lake restaurant after the whites asked them, 
insultingly, if they were in town for a Honda convention and where their 
cameras were. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived in Silver Lake for some 20 years, and Silver Lake is one of the 
most diverse communities around," said one of the businessmen, Martin V. Lee, a 
real estate developer and attorney. "It's kind of frightening to see that 
happen in our neighborhood."

Asians in Southern California -- as in many other parts of the United States -- 
are increasingly becoming targets of anti-Asian backlash or resentments similar 
to that seen against Japanese-Americans during World War II or against Chinese 
immigrants during the anti-Asian hysteria of the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Violence has also been reported between blacks and Korean grocery store owners 
in black neighborhoods. Blacks have claimed the store owners do not hire enough 
blacks or mistreat black customers. In high schools and colleges, white 
students have attacked Asian students or taunted them with racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
The backlash stems in part from trade frictions with Japan and other Asian 
nations. It also derives from the rapid growth of Asian immigration here and 
the resulting economic competition between those newcomers and non-Asians over 
jobs and scare resources. Some blame just simple intolerance or ignorance over 
cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
The backlash has entered political and business arenas. Several companies have 
instituted "English only" rules limiting the ability of Asians and other 
immigrants to speak their native tongues at work. Elected officials like Los 
Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden have called for restrictions to limit real 
estate investments by Asians and Asian immigrants who are not U.S. citizens. In 
Monterey Park, where the Chinese immigrant population has boomed in the past 
decade, some City Council members are considering limits on Chinese-language 
business signs as well as Chinese-language books in the public library. 
</P>
<P>
But in its ugliest side, the backlash has come in the form of racially 
motivated violence, intimidation and epithets, in some cases coming from other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Rights reports increasing "hate 
crimes" against Asians as part of overall trend of rising racially motivated 
attacks against minorities. These include graffiti and hate literature, 
assaults or attempted assaults, and vandalism, said Eugene S. Mornell, 
commission executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there are many more incidents than are reported," said Mornell, 
noting that Asians tend to mistrust police or have cultural or language 
barriers that hinder their reporting of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
However, government agencies and community leaders are beginning to undertake 
innovative efforts to stem the tide. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department has set up a program to monitor incidents of 
racial, religious and anti-gay violence, a program hailed by some community 
leaders as the first of its kind among major West Coast cities. And while the 
program has been ineffective among some Asians due to their lack of knowledge 
of English and the LAPD's lack of bilingual staff to communicate with 
immigrants, efforts are under way to improve the program and better publicize 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Korean and black church and community leaders have eased tensions through 
meetings of diverse community representatives. To further reduce tensions among 
minorities, community leaders are planning a conference sometime this year for 
black, Latino, Asian and American Indian business and community leaders. The 
aim: To foster economic development, joint ventures, fair share agreements, 
better communications and hiring practices.

According to research, children first learn prejudice from their parents. This 
happens around age 5. 
</P>
<P>
By age 7, children begin to mimic their parents' racial attitudes and behavior. 
And by age 9, most of their racial attitudes and behavior are fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
How children feel and act toward racial, ethnic and religious minority groups 
is a direct result of what they learn from their parents, child-care providers, 
teachers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, peers and the media. 
</P>
<P>
We have developed this resource, which includes quizzes, activities and ideas, 
to help parents and teachers do something about reducing prejudice and its 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of working through this guide, we hope parents and teachers will 
gain a greater awareness so that discrimination and prejudice are not taught to 
children in homes and in schools. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that parents of racial and ethnic children will be better able to teach 
their children coping skills they can use when confronted with prejudice and 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
We hope that teachers will have better skills and more resources to use as they 
work toward bringing equality to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we hope that all people will have a greater appreciation and respect 
for the diverse cultures that are woven into the fabric of our Southern 
California community. 
</P>
<P>
DID YOU KNOW? 
</P>
<P>
Roger Wilkins, a senior research fellow at the Washington-based Institute for 
Policy Studies, says, "One of the central issues of American racism is denial 
-- denial that it exists, denial that it is as bad as it is, denial that ... 
people are injured by it." The following questions, which are based on news 
reports, are aimed at making parents and teachers more aware that prejudice and 
discrimination are real and growing problems. 
</P>
<P>
1. According to the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, in 1985 the 
number of racially and religiously motivated acts of vandalism and violence in 
the county: 
</P>
<P>
A. Fell by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
B. Were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
C. Climbed by 82%. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is C. Incidents included the firebombing of an interracial 
couple's automobile, an ethnically motivated assault against an Arab at his 
place of work and numerous instances of swastikas painted on Jewish property 
and KKK slogans on property owned by blacks. As a result, Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley called for closer police reporting and monitoring by LAPD of such hate 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. The Glendale Police Department's first black officer testified in 1987 that 
he was greeted with the following at a party for rookies who had passed 
probation: 
</P>
<P>
A. A cross-burning. 
</P>
<P>
B. Racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
C. A warm welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is A. Ronald E. Jenkins testified before the state Workers' 
Compensation Board that the cross-buring and other incidents of discrimination 
forced him to take disability leave from the force. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. In Huntington Park in 1984, Latino employees at the Municipal Court were 
required to speak Spanish to the public when necessary. In their dealings with 
co-workers, they: 
</P>
<P>
A. Were encouraged to speak Spanish or English. 
</P>
<P>
B. Were prohibited from speaking Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
C. Were required to teach Spanish on their breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is B. The English-only rule, imposed after passage of a 
statewide English-only initiative, was barred by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals, which said it contributed to a workplace atmosphere that discriminates 
against Latinos and heightens racial animosity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. In many universities -- both large and small, liberal and conservative -- 
throughout the United States, incidents of racism on campus over the last two 
years have: 
</P>
<P>
A. Increased. 
</P>
<P>
B. Stayed the same. 
</P>
<P>
C. Decreased. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is A. College campuses have not proven to be havens from 
bigotry -- from cross-burnings to hate-stained graffiti and even to physical 
assaults. Even more widespread are subtle forms of racism -- such as 
condescension and standoffishness from Anglo professors -- that minority 
students confront daily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5. More than 90% of all senior management posts in corporate America and public 
school administration positions nationwide are held by: 
</P>
<P>
A. Anglo men and women. 
</P>
<P>
B. Anglo and minority men. 
</P>
<P>
C. Anglo men. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is C. Anglo men hold 97% of all senior management jobs. 
Studies have foundthat women managers often get less prestigious assignments 
and supervise fewer workers than do men. Minority managers often get positions 
that don't lead to senior management. In public education, 95% of school 
principals and district superintendents are Anglo men, according to a study by 
the National Center for Education Information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6. Los Angeles County has the largest urban population nationwide of American 
Indians. Why are they called the silent minority of Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
A. They do not form tight urban communities, making it difficult to voice 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
B. They are too small in number and too scattered to effectively fight 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
C. They are often mistaken for another race. 
</P>
<P>
D. All of the above 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is D. While California has the largest number of Indian 
residents of any state, they rank among the smallest minority in Los Angeles 
county, accounting for only 1% of its population. Bell Gardens, Cudahy and 
South Gate are home to 3% of the county's American Indians. The overall state 
population is expected to increase significantly by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8. For the past 112 years in statewide elected offices in California, Latinos: 
</P>
<P>
A. Have been under-represented. 
</P>
<P>
B. Have been well represented. 
</P>
<P>
C. Have not won a single post. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is C. Although Latinos serve in the state Legislature and in 
other electedpositions, they have never held statewide offices, such as 
governor, U.S. senator and superintendent of public instruction. In a survey of 
California registered voters by the Los Angeles Times Poll, more bias was found 
to exist against Latino candidates on a statewide ballot than against blacks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9. In an April, 1987, interview on the TV show "Nightline," Ted Koppel asked 
then-Dodger Vice President Al Campanis why there were no black managers in 
baseball. What was the response? 
</P>
<P>
A. Blacks did not actively seek management positions. 
</P>
<P>
B. Blacks did not have the ability. 
</P>
<P>
C. Playing baseball was more lucrative than managing it. 
</P>
<P>
The correct answer is B. Despite several chances to explain his answer, 
Campanis continued to make bold statements reflecting stereotypes and 
misinformation about blacks. Campanis later left the Dodgers.

<TEXT>
<P>
In December, 1987, I bought a house in South-Central Los Angeles and moved 
there from the Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
I expected my life to change. I was a new homeowner in a neighborhood with not 
the best of reputations. With the newspaper stories about gang and drug 
problems in mind, I was braced for problems with the people who would be my 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I found that my real problems were with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Services I took for granted in the Fairfax District were nonexistent in my new 
neighborhood. While city street sweepers kept my old neighborhood relatively 
clean, litter remained untouched on my new street. After weeks of watching the 
street sweeper roll down the middle of the street, brushes up and idle, I began 
making about two calls a week to the city to complain. After four weeks of 
calls, the brushes did touch the pavement, but most of the street went unswept 
because of abandoned or illegally parked cars, none ticketed. 
</P>
<P>
So again I took to the phone. Sanitation told me that they couldn't sweep if 
cars were illegally parked, and that the cars were not their problem. 
Transportation told me they couldn't ticket the cars because there were not 
enough signs restricting parking and the signs were not their problem. So with 
my phone book in hand, I tracked down who was responsible for posting signs. It 
only took a couple of weeks to get more signs posted. Two more weeks of trash 
piled up. 
</P>
<P>
With that accomplished, I got in touch with transportation once again to let 
them know that they could begin ticketing and to request -- for what seemed 
like the hundredth time -- the removal of a car that had been abandoned by the 
previous tenants of my house. They said they would begin ticketing and mark the 
tires of the abandoned car "in a couple of weeks." After marking the tires of 
an abandoned car, the city has to wait 72 hours before removing the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Well, cars started to get ticketed and the street got swept, but getting the 
abandoned car removed was another matter. After weeks of calling, I was totally 
frustrated. In one last effort I called transportation and told them if the car 
was not removed by the end of that day, I was going to pay to have the car 
towed to Mayor Bradley's or Councilman Farrell's house. Four tow trucks showed 
up that afternoon, and the car was removed. So much for being diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is only one of the problems that residents of my area have to deal with 
every day. There are no decent grocery stores, department stores or parks or 
playgrounds in the area, although liquor stores, nail salons and mini-malls 
abound. The ice cream trucks that travel the streets night and day are known to 
sell more than just push-up sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
Car insurance, while high-priced for most in Los Angeles, reaches astronomic 
proportions in South-Central. In the first three months I owned my home, my 
homeowners insurance was cancelled twice in spite of having passed loan 
inspections and having a burglar alarm. The companies didn't give reasons but 
did say I could write for an explantion. But there is little time for 
corresponding with insurance companies when you are threatened with 
foreclosure, which is what happens when you don't have insurance. My neighbors 
tell me that my experience is not uncommon. I and a number of my neighbors have 
had our homeowners insurance canceled for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
Just going to the grocery store is a reminder of the area's status. There is 
essentially one grocery chain in the area, and in survey after survey its 
prices are the highest in the city. People in the Westside would be shocked at 
the lack of variety and the poor quality of the products, to say nothing of the 
stores' dirty conditions and lack of service. The standard joke where I live is 
that Boys gets its produce in Vons' alley. Of course it's no joke when you are 
the one buying the produce. The people who are lucky enough to have 
transportation go out of the area to shop, which is both time-consuming and 
inconvenient. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning violations are rampant especially in multi-unit buildings. It is common 
to see one-bedroom apartments with up to 20 people living in them. I have heard 
the arguments that it is racist and elitist to enforce zoning regulations in 
poor minority areas. My answer to that is that it is racist and elitist to 
believe that those of us who live in South-Central don't have the right to have 
our quality of life protected by zoning regulations. 
</P>
<P>
There are many who live in the area who take pride in their homes and 
neighborhoods and are working to improve them. It is discouraging to see 
council members seeking higher office argue that those of us who live in 
redevelopment areas, designated such because of blight, should bear the burden 
of most of the of low-income housing for the city. We have more than our fair 
share of poverty and its resultant problems, few of which I witnessed on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
I have gotten to know my neighbors while we have been out working in our yards 
or sweeping up trash out on the street, and I have great respect for them. They 
are people who want better lives for themselves and their children in spite of 
what sometimes seem insurmountable odds. These are people who work hard all day 
and spend their leisure hours meeting in groups to find ways to get rid of 
drug-trafficking and prostitution and devote weekends to painting out graffiti. 
While many people blame the residents of South-Central for the area's problems, 
I see many who are trying to be part of solution. 
</P>
<P>
Every neighborhood -- regardless of the color of the people, the number who 
speak English or who are citizens -- deserves equality of services. The normal 
trials of everyday life are enough. We should not have to fight the 
institutions that are meant to serve us as well.

Part of what drew my husband and me to Southern California was our enchantment 
with the diversity of the people. 
</P>
<P>
In Ohio, we were used to blacks and whites. Here, we would live in an Encino 
apartment complex with neighbors from Trinidad, Mexico, Guyana, South Africa, 
Israel and Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
We expected to lose the sense of being minorities. That hasn't happened. But, 
neither have we encountered the discrimination we feared. 
</P>
<P>
Today, we live in a quiet, suburban neighborhood in Northridge, along the 
northern edge of the San Fernando Valley. Census figures say about 3.7% of our 
neighbors are black. We would have guessed lower, judging from the few black 
faces we see on the streets, in the stores, at nearby parks and in schools. 
</P>
<P>
We moved in two years ago during a summer when news reports carried accounts of 
a cross burning at a black family's home and an interracial family being 
hounded out of a white neighborhood in other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
My husband and I slept fitfully our first few nights in our new home, waiting 
for the sound of eggs splattering against the garage or the smell of a cross 
burning on our front lawn. The nights were blissfully peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, our presence was hardly acknowledged by our neighbors, save for the 
neighborhood children who continued to use our huge front lawn for a playground 
and embraced our toddler daughter as a playmate. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you black?" one young neighbor asked as she sat on our grass with my 
daughter on her lap. "Yes," I said. "Why?" I held my breath, waiting for the 
racial slur I presumed would follow. "My dad said some black people were moving 
in here," she answered, simply and innocently. 
</P>
<P>
Our neighbors had noticed, but they didn't seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
We were conditioned by life to expect the worst so it took us months to stop 
suspecting racists behind every bush. 
</P>
<P>
When the house next door went up for sale a few months after we had moved in, 
we were convinced our neighbors didn't want to live next door to a black 
family. Our pregnant neighbor later confided that her growing family simply 
needed more room. 
</P>
<P>
And, I remember the summer morning I awoke to find a watermelon on our front 
porch. 
</P>
<P>
I stepped gingerly over it, trying not to think of what it could mean. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe a neighbor was merely sharing the bounty of a back yard garden. Or maybe 
someone was trying to tell us that watermelon-eating black folks aren't wanted. 
</P>
<P>
I brooded over it all day until I came home from work that night and noticed 
watermelons lined up on porches up and down the street. It wasn't a message for 
us, just another "gift" from a zealous real estate broker anxious for business. 
</P>
<P>
For sure, there have been slights and aggravations -- the "friendly" neighbor 
who followed her greeting with a joke about "dumb" mistakes made by black 
students in the high school class she teaches; the woman who stopped me during 
an evening walk to ask, "What are you?" and dashed away without a "goodby" when 
she learned I am a garden-variety black American, not some exotic breed of 
dark-skinned foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
But there have also been some delights that give me hope for a future that 
recognizes the equality of all Americans: helping the girls across the street 
learn about the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as they prepared to celebrate his 
birthday at their parochial school and learning that my blond 9-year-old 
neighbor wants to marry singer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I worry about problems to come. My daughter moves constantly from white 
neighborhood to black household where the pictures on the wall depict black 
people, the music is black, her dolls are black. 
</P>
<P>
How will she learn to reconcile those worlds in her mind? How can we help her 
face the inevitable racial slights, such as that suffered by the 4-year-old 
daughter of a black friend when a preschool classmate refused to play with her 
"because you're black and that's ugly." 
</P>
<P>
For now, the problems are small and subtle. I wish I didn't have to search to 
find find panty hose in a color darker than "suntan" or a record store with a 
gospel music section or dolls with brown faces. I wish I didn't have to drive 
past scores of Korean barbecues, Mexican cantinas and Jewish delis in search of 
a "soul food" restaurant for Sunday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
And I wish I didn't have to always feel like a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
I've lived most of my life in black neighborhoods. I was educated in black 
schools. I started my career at a black newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after nearly 10 years in white neighborhoods, it's still a bit like living 
in a foreign country. I speak the language, but my accent is off. I understand 
the culture, but I don't share it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a constant struggle to separate what happens to me because I'm black and 
what just happens. Are the people down the block really staring as I walk by? 
Did the salesclerk pass over me because he doesn't like blacks? I catch a 
glimpse of myself in a department store mirror, surrounded by white shoppers, 
and realize how different I seem. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I enjoy my neighborhood. There are very real benefits to suburban life 
-- no crack dealers on street corners, convenient shopping centers, 
well-equipped parks, quiet streets. 
</P>
<P>
And I like my neighbors. My cul-de-sac is a friendly one where people lend 
tools, share labor on home projects, tend to each other's children, exchange 
Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
I wish more blacks would look at the benefits of living out here, and I wish we 
could forge more bonds with black families already here. 
</P>
<P>
There's a strange etiquette that governs chance meetings by blacks here. Some 
greet you with relieved eyes and a cheery "Hello." They are eager to exchange 
phone numbers and stay in touch. Others avert their eyes as if recognition 
would blow their cover. 
</P>
<P>
We deplore that attitude. But we also understand it only too well.

Pechanga Indian Vincent Ibanez will never forget the day his fourth-grade 
teacher ordered him to stand in front of the class so that "the kids could see 
whose ancestors killed their ancestors." 
</P>
<P>
"My teacher's name was Mrs. Rice, and it happened at Graham Elementary School 
in South Los Angeles," said Ibanez, 56, who lives in a mobile home on the 
4,000-acre Pechanga Indian Reservation near the Riverside County community of 
Temecula. "I just stood there. It really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the former California Regional Water Quality Control Board 
official learned to rely on the advice of tribal elders: When a white man asks 
a question, be polite to him, listen to him -- but don't say anything. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, he deflects bigotry with a humorous aside, although "I have 
friends who would punch someone for things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Ibanez mentioned the time he was negotiating a road easement with Caltrans 
officials and local non-Indian residents at a coffee shop in Temecula when a 
man in the group said, "All you Indians sponge off the government." 
</P>
<P>
Ibanez smiled and said, "I just hope you keep paying your taxes so I can keep 
getting my government check." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Ibanez, a heavy-set man with shoulder-length gray hair 
who served four years on a U.S. Navy battle cruiser that saw action in the 
Korean War, said, "In fact, we don't get government checks." 
</P>
<P>
Ibanez's experiences reflect those of many American Indians whose modern 
history is told mostly through a struggle to overcome economic hardship, 
bigotry and stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is seen today in elementary school lessons that suggest American 
Indians were a primitive people who spoke with their hands, ate acorns and no 
longer exist; in sports mascots that cavort around the playing field wearing a 
fake big nose and feathers, and in movies and Saturday morning cartoons that 
exaggerate Indian features and customs for comical relief. 
</P>
<P>
"They say it's all in fun," said Alfreda Mitre, 34, a Piute Indian from 
southern Nevada and director of the Native American Student Program at UC 
Riverside. "But Indians look at those things and wonder when is it all going to 
end?" 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Ibanez helped organize the Native American Observer Training Assn. to 
help his people defend themselves against non-Indians who try to make a quick 
profit on reservations through illegal development schemes. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which operates as a technical school, also teaches Indians 18 
and older how existing environmental laws can be used to protect areas of 
historical or religious significance. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the once-remote Pechanga reservation has been surrounded by 
housing developments and commercial growth that he said "threatens to impact 
our way of life." 
</P>
<P>
"There are many spiritual places in these hills," Ibanez said, pointing in the 
darkness toward a mountain ridge sprinkled with the lights of new homes built 
just outside the reservation's border. "When things got hard, I used to go 
there and pray."

<P>
One Friday afternoon three years ago, French teacher Nadia Bettindorf came home 
to a ringing phone. "Did you hear the news?" a friend asked. "Alex has been 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
Bettindorf, a founding member of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination 
Committee, had known its regional director, Alex Odeh, for 11 years during 
which both Palestinians spoke out for understanding, for dialogue and for an 
end to stereotyping of all Arabs as greedy, oil-rich terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The news brought tears for her friend, a gentle man who never raised his voice 
in anger. It also released an old anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Palestinian, I knew I was not safe in Israel," said Bettindorf, who was 5 
years old in 1948 when the state of Israel was created and her family confined 
to a ghetto in Jaffa. Now she felt "as a Palestinian, I was not safe even in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Odeh's suspected killer has been traced to the West Bank of Israel but not 
arrested on charges of throwing the fatal bomb into the committee's West Coast 
office in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Bettindorf said some Orange County Arabs wanted to move to a place 
that would be safer or camouflage their heritage, stop identifying themselves 
as Arabs, change their names. Many still do. 
</P>
<P>
But Bettindorf picked up Odeh's speaking engagements because, she said, "the 
truth has to be heard. I refuse to be silenced." 
</P>
<P>
She smiled wryly. "My husband says, 'Go get 'em, Don Quixote.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bettindorf, a teacher at St. Paul's Catholic High School in Santa Fe Springs, 
married an American she met at the University of Minnesota where she was 
studying French and classics. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his German-derived name and because she is Christian, not Moslem, 
she said she and her two children have been spared the blatant name-calling or 
job and rental discrimination reported by some of the 75,000 Orange County 
immigrants from among the 23 Arabic countries in North Africa and the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
Bettindorf saw prejudice turn to emotional bias and bigotry spread by 
stereotypes of Arabs in cartoons, television news and drama. "They show the 
stereotype of the greedy Arab, rich, controlling money. It dehumanizes a whole 
section of society -- then it's easy to do bad things to them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the 80s, of course, we added the religious dimension with (Iran's Ayatollah 
Ruhollah) Khomeini and Islam, and you got all of this misinformation and 
disinformation about what Arabs and Muslims are. This wave of bigotry came and 
aggravated the situation altogether. Because Arabs are considered different and 
evil, then you did not want them to work for you and all of that." 
</P>
<P>
When emotions flared after a wave of Arab kidnapings, she said an Arab bakery 
in Garden Grove burned down. But the owner did not want to report it. "He said, 
'Don't do anything.' He was afraid they would come to his house and burn it, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
One Palestinian accountant who asked not to be identified said his boss refused 
to let him handle checks because "I would steal it and give it to the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose wife has a master's degree in psychology, said he was also told 
he could not supervise women because of "the way your culture treats women." 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County resident for 15 years, he said he has been thinking of 
changing his name to Robert Higgins, "a complete Anglo name." A friend of his 
changed his name from Nadiem to Ned. "At least when you send your resume, they 
don't know who you are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bettindorf's son Eric said his eighth-grade social studies teacher was 
explaining stereotypes to the class one day. "He said one that's not a 
stereotype is that the Arabs all have 15 children so they can drive the Jews 
into the sea," he said. "I knew it was wrong." But rather than make an issue of 
it in class, he told his mother who later explained to the teacher that she is 
an Arab who does not fit that description. She received a noncommittal response 
without an apology and chose not to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
"As a mother, I don't want to do anything so the teacher would take it out on 
my child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the experience left her son frustrated and feeling his teacher was 
"stupid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
He also told her about another teacher, annoyed with an Egyptian boy in class, 
who said, "Why don't you go buy a Mercedes?" and on another occasion, "Go pump 
some more oil." 
</P>
<P>
"People don't think how that affects a 14-year-old child. He knows not all 
Arabs pump oil and have Mercedes," Bettindorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints were reported about Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine 
professors, she said. When students try to contradict the professor, they 
receive an answer such as, "Who's the teacher here?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the brutal, petty and insensitive acts of some, Bettindorf can still 
say, "I do believe in the goodness of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
Both Bettindorf and the man who would be Robert Higgins have joined the Orange 
County Cousins Club, a group of about 30 Jews and Palestinians who meet to talk 
over current events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"The more we talk, the more human we become to each other," she said.

By BOB STEWART, Times Staff Writer Keeping a job or finding one can be 
difficult for everyone, but it becomes especially hard when you are evaluated 
on aspects other than your ability to do the work. Times staff writer Bob 
Stewart talked with these five job-seekers. 
</P>

CARLOS DELGADO 
</P>
<P>
"Discrimination is everywhere you go. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of life in this country . . . the way people talk to you, the way 
people react when you ask questions or when you make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at you like, 'Oh, you damn foreigner. You don't know what you're 
doing,' even though everybody makes mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Delgado is a citizen of the United States. Born in El Salvador, he has 
lived and worked in this country for 17 of his 36 years and for two of them 
served in the U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
He is well-dressed and well-spoken, an accountant by trade, who this chilly 
December morning is sitting in a chair in the Hollywood office of the state 
Department of Employment Development. Delgado is seeking temporary employment 
to fill a gap between assignments from the agency for which he usually works. 
</P>
<P>
"I also lived in other countries. I lived in France. I lived in Germany, 
England. It's not as bad there as in the United States. I don't know why. But I 
guess the rhythm of living in this country makes people act a different way." 
</P>
<P>
THEOPEHILUS DEAN 
</P>
<P>
"I was doing some janitor work. The supervisor was Hispanic, and there was 
three or four blacks who worked there at the time. I noticed he used to make 
the black people work a little harder than the people of his race. They could 
go back and lounge around and stuff, and he would try to make us do all the 
strenuous work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I quit after about a week. The supervisor kept complaining about the work that 
we did and there were only three blacks that worked there. And as far as I know 
the work that I did, everything was completed. . . . I know the work was good. 
But he always had complaints." Theopehilus Dean is 21. He wants to make a 
living playing the drums. But he knows the odds of doing that are long. So he 
scans the job listings at the South Avalon Boulevard employment office as he 
explains how he learned that racial prejudice is not restricted to blacks and 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
FRANCES WESSON 
</P>
<P>
"I was working at this place in Carson. it was called. . . . Dang, what was the 
name of it? I can't remember. It was a packing company, packing screws and 
parts for airplanes and stuff like that. The majority of them was Mexicans, and 
I was the only black there." 
</P>
<P>
Frances Wesson, 24, a school bus driver, is collecting her unemployment check 
for the two-week Christmas holiday at the employment office at South Avalon 
Boulevard and 127th Street. A big woman who smiles easily, Wesson recalled that 
the woman who hired her at the packing company treated her fairly. 
</P>
<P>
"Her name was Julia, and she really liked me and she had got me on. I started 
working, and she went on vacation. And then everything got hectic because the 
boss's wife had came back and started taking over. 
</P>
<P>
"She would just find little things that I did wrong, you know, and make up 
things on me. She was white, OK. She lived in Palos Verdes and stuff, so you 
know how that is. I could tell she didn't like me. And so a couple of days 
later (the boss) called me in the office and said, 'I'm sorry Frances. We're 
going to have to let you go because too many shipments have been coming up 
wrong,' or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
"But I didn't believe that was true. She didn't want me there. When Julia left, 
when my supervisor went on vacation, that's when they thought to get rid of me. 
. . . If you go in there now, you wouldn't even see a black person in there." 
</P>
<P>
PATTI YASUTAKE 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an actress, so it's tough because you're selling your face. You're selling 
your type." 
</P>
<P>
Patti Yasutake said the pattern of discrimination against women and minorities 
in the acting profession is a difficult one to track. Is there a dearth of good 
parts because casting directors are prejudiced, because writers are not 
encouraged to build the parts into their scripts, or because studio and network 
executives do not believe that ethnic diversity will pay off at the box office? 
</P>
<P>
At the Hollywood employment office, Yasutake, bundled up against the December 
chill in a fashionably oversized overcoat, waits to check in with an official 
who wants to know if she has been making proper progress in her search for 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"You need the writers and producers. . . . So it carries over to those 
professions where there aren't enough of us in those positions either. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And what do you do when the powers that be, who control production and fund 
all that sort of thing, don't necessarily think that's what's going to sell 
their product. It's a business to them, and so they're looking at numbers. 
They're looking at the greatest return on their investment. . . . It becomes a 
very complex situation." 
</P>
<P>
JEFFREY DAWKINS 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Dawkins, a young black man from the East Coast, has spent nine months 
unsuccessfully trying to find work as a manager of a medical laboratory, the 
field in which he was trained and has experience. As he waits in line in the 
Hollywood unemployment office, neatly dressed in stone-washed gray denims, 
Dawkins said that not all prejudice focuses on race, sex or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, I've been discriminated against in the business world for 
my being young and being from New York. . . . I was a coordinator for medical 
labs, three labs in New York City. And in my search for employment and dropping 
off my resumes at jobs which are applicable to what I've done, I've noticed a 
frown, instantly, the moment I say New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't say that it's due to my race. Being young, 24, and from New York, 
it really raises an eyebrow. I know some (prospective employers) who say, 'We 
need someone who knows more about the laws here in California.' But I have been 
taking a few courses on my own to find out the differences, and there isn't 
that much difference."

OFFICER WORKS TO REAP A HARVEST OF HOPE IN WATTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officer Wayne Guillary, in his pressed blues, nosed the black and white out of 
the Southeast Division parking lot onto the streets of Watts. Guillary has been 
staring at these streets and its people all his life. He grew up here, he and 
his two brothers, in a modest home on Mary Avenue near 103rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
Guillary, 32, has been on the force for seven years and has risen to the rank 
of P-3, a supervisory position. 
</P>
<P>
He approaches his job with almost missionary zeal. He is trying desperately, he 
says, to return something to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
For Guillary, the realities of the street and the politics of the job present a 
troubling dichotomy. He works in a division where nearly all the residents are 
black, save a spattering of Latinos. Nearly all the officers are white. 
</P>
<P>
Guillary heads area A-3, a segment bounded by Central Avenue on the west, Wall 
Street on the East, Manchester Boulevard on the north and 103rd Street on the 
south. It includes middle-income areas and striving families as well as 
stretches of urban badlands, gangs, troublesome liquor stores. On the streets 
are baseheads and strawberries, the local nicknames for the men and women 
strung out on crack cocaine. Often, he ends up arresting people he grew up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
Today is a slow day. He will meet with three block clubs to boost their spirits 
with an upbeat crime report, roust crack addicts from three vacant houses, 
arrest one woman for prostitution and possession of crack cocaine. Her trick, 
on probation, will also be charged with possession. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I believe there is no hope for black people. I was very optimistic 
when I started out. I didn't think it would be worse. It's changed in a way 
that I sometimes feel, 'Are we going to make it over that hill?' That mountain 
looks pretty high. It's a mountain of crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wonder who cares. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, but I can't quit. I look at my old grandfather who's 95 years old. 
James Fuzee. When he can sit back and tell me the hardships that he's seen 
black America go through, I know I can't quit. When he talks about the 
hardships and the strides that blacks have made over the years, it's much worse 
than what we're dealing with today. My grandfather said if our ancestors could 
go through all that hardship, if we can come over here and be put through 
slavery for 250 years, we can come out of this condition we're in today. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard. It's hard trying to be strong. There are times I look at kids 
and tears come to my eyes. I feel for them. I wish there was something that I 
could do. I'm doing something morally that I think is right by being in this 
uniform. I get down on their level and tell them they can make it. There may or 
may not be a lot of other black cops who do it, but it means something to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for these people. I really do. To have to wake up every morning, turn 
on your radio and here that in South-Central Los Angeles, 'Three gang shootings 
occurred. Three men are dead, separate locations.' You find out that the family 
is watching television or having a little birthday party, somebody drives up 
and shoots in the house and a little kid gets killed. It's sad. 
</P>
<P>
"People are afraid to let their kids out. You won't see a lot of children 
walking up and down Wadsworth because we've got the gangs over here. We've got 
Avalon, 89th Street gang. We've got men who are just walking the street 
unemployed, and it's intimidating to the citizens. They see graffiti on the 
walls. They see gang members walking down the street with their pants hanging 
down, a rag hanging out their pocket, their sneakers untied, dark shades on. 
That's intimidating to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to a young lady one time on the street, I said, 'People try to clean 
up your neighborhood, take pride in it. There's too much crime.' You know what 
that young lady told me. She said, 'We don't need the police around here. We 
are the crime.' 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to my friends about it sometimes. They really don't understand the 
problems. They hear it on the news, and they say that's sad, but I'm right in 
it. They say, 'I don't know if it's that bad.' I say take a ride for yourself 
and see how many (prostitutes) you can pick up on Figueroa. If I could get a 
bus to follow me . . . I could fill it with girls that I pick up. I guarantee 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Guillary turns right off San Pedro onto 92nd Street. He and his partner 
cautiously check an apparently abandoned house frequented by crack addicts. The 
stench of urine and human feces meets them at the door. They find a man inside. 
His fingers are badly singed -- a tell-tale sign of a crack addict who clutches 
the glass pipe even as it burns his skin. Guillary warns him that he is 
trespassing and promises to arrest him if he finds him in the house again. 
</P>
<P>
The unit heads through Nickerson Gardens. Heads turn. Stares. A young boy asks 
about baseball cards that police often hand out. No baseball cards today. 
</P>
<P>
"There's discrimination within the department. There are a lot of blacks who 
say Southeast isn't fair, but there have been changes made. Guys look and say, 
'Guillary, you're the only black senior lead in the division. You're in a 
predominantly black area. Why is that?' I can't answer it. Those decisions are 
beyond my control. 
</P>
<P>
"They're making gradual changes. We'll never get rid of racism and 
discrimination to 100%. You have to deal with it every day. It's not a constant 
or where it's blatant. I've worked with a lot of good white partners in black 
neighborhoods. There are some good white officers in the division who care. We 
have several lieutenants who like to see the affirmative action plan applied. I 
think if you saw a lot of undercover black cops who are effective in those 
areas, you're going to see some officers taking interest in that. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out in Hollywood Division as a probationary officer in 1981. I was 
the only black on morning watch. They had blacks in division, but on that watch 
I was the only one. It's kind of a funny feeling. You're sitting there with 
your counterparts, and they might crack and joke, and it might be a racial 
joke. And if you took offense, you might find yourself in a hard place. You've 
gotta have a pretty thick skin to be a police officer because there are a lot 
of jokes being thrown at you. Some are said with meanness, and others are said 
to crack a joke. If you don't have a thick skin, it can hurt you. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very touchy situation to talk about at times because you don't know who 
you may offend. Around here, they've had training days when no blacks are 
involved. It could have been an oversight or just something they just weren't 
aware of. But if you saw more blacks in narcotics, administrative vice, being 
detectives and working those areas, you would in fact see a possible change in 
the crime factor. They may have some effect in getting to the heart of the 
problem. They can't rid the entire community of the problem, but I think to 
infiltrate some of those areas, you'll find that a black was able to get into 
those areas before a white guy. If some of the black guys went undercover, they 
look the part. They can talk the talk." 
</P>
<P>
Cruising down Figueroa, Guillary spots a suspected prostitute. He stops to chat 
and notices her left hand clenching something. Inside is crack. She squeals on 
a trick inside a hotel. Guillary and a backup unit barge in. The man is in bed 
watching adult movies. A smattering of cocaine is found in his possession. Both 
are arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went for my interview to become P-3, they asked me why I wanted it and 
what I was trying to accomplish. I think my answer to them sums up my feelings 
about what I'm doing here. See, I'm like the farmer. Right now land is barren 
and the soil rocky, and everybody wants to abandon it. But I feel that if I'm 
persistent in staying here, I can get something done. I believe if I could rid 
the land of all the problems, then I feel that when the land become productive 
and fruitful, I would reap the harvest. I think that we could all reap the 
harvest."

When Dr. Gloria Powell, a black child psychiatrist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric 
Institute, speaks about the troubling disparity between the quality of white 
and black lives, she often uses a word that whites seldom hear and often have 
trouble swallowing: Negrophobia, the social science theory that explains 
discrimination as the result of an innate discomfort whites feel toward blacks. 
Powell, who specializes in the psychological and social development of minority 
children, has been a resident of Los Angeles since 1965. She lives in Pacific 
Palisades. These are excerpts of an interview with Times staff writer Bob 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 If you look in the literature about Afro-Americans and the effects of slavery, 
the view that comes through most resoundingly is the word Negrophobia. In "The 
American Dilemma," Gunnar Myrdal talks about the conflict between the 
Negrophobia that is deeply ridden in American society and the goal of achieving 
total equality and says the handling of the Negro and where to put him has 
always been a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
I am struck when I look at the changes since the Watts riots, that we have so 
many more (public health) buildings, but we don't have the programs or the 
money for the programs to provide the comprehensive services that the children 
in that area really need. We have not by and large changed the health picture, 
the education picture, the social lives. 
</P>
<P>
The contrast for California in terms of the wealth and how it is spent and used 
and who gets services and who doesn't is very striking to someone like me, who 
comes from Boston. I grew up on a street called Elbert Street, a little 
dead-end street in the middle of Roxbury, in a tenement house. My father died 
when I was 3. We were one of first families to receive funding under a new 
program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. The resources that were 
available to us were extensive: Freedom House, a social services agency, 
produced a whole host of black youngsters who went on to college. The South End 
Music School had people from the Boston Symphony Orchestra who would volunteer 
their time to teach needy youngsters. I think we paid 25 cent a lesson. Every 
single summer from the time my brother was 7 until he was 17 he was away from 
Roxbury at a YMCA camp. I belonged to a marvelous Girl Scout troop which 
allowed us to see all the museums in Boston, all the surrounding communities, 
plays. It was an expansive experience. 
</P>
<P>
As I sit at a desk in the Kaiser Watts counseling center or the Hawkins Mental 
Health Center and make my diagnosis, so many times I have wanted to say: 
"Freedom House, three times a week." Or, "Enroll this kid in a Boys Club and 
let him learn how to swim." Or, "Send this kid to a class at Boston Teachers 
College for children who stammer." Or, "Send this kid to South End Music School 
and let him have some music to develop his self-concept." Besides Kaiser Watt's 
tutorial center, where are the other tutorial programs we can send this child? 
Because he's already in third grade and reading at pre-kindergarten level and 
his report cards have been saying A all the time and the teachers are reporting 
he's doing work at grade level, and then when he takes the national test, he's 
in the 22nd percentile. Sit in one of the elementary schools. Go where I go, 
sit where I sit and you'll see it. 
</P>
<P>
When you look at the way people vote and set their priorities, it's Negrophobia 
in some respects. Those who have an awful lot and those who don't have exist in 
larger numbers than we would like to recognize. Those who have don't want to 
give up anything that they have because you know how they think about it. The 
fearfulness that if we give "them" too much it would be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
As a black there's no way you can escape it. If you are Hispanic and learn 
English very, very well, you can become more amalgamated into society. But for 
blacks the amalgamation process is much more difficult. It's a constant 
reminder. 
</P>
<P>
The way the media covers gangs perpetuates this in Los Angeles. Too often they 
show all the problems of blacks without looking at the ecological factors. Less 
than 5% of all black kids in L.A. are part of gangs. What happens to the other 
95%? Every teacher everywhere the children go will think of them like those 
black kids they saw on TV. Because in California people are so far from the 
black community, the only way they know anything about blacks is what they see 
on TV. So it makes a difference for me with my son. I've had to teach him 
differently than other people would. I had to say things like, "I know you're 
driving with so-and-so and so-and-so, but if you get caught by the police, 
don't make a remark." I didn't like having to expose that part of society to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
I had an incident in a market once in which the checker wanted my driver's 
license, which I thought was reasonable, but then he wanted my Social Security 
number, then the telephone number of my office, and then he wanted to call my 
boss to verify I worked there. I was furious. I said to my children: "Children, 
you are observing racism at this very moment. What is happening to Mommy is 
racist. Watch how I deal with it." I called the manager. He came over and 
apologized, then took me aside and said, "Dr. Powell, it's kind of rough around 
here. You would do yourself a favor to put M.D. on your check." I said, "I 
don't want to advertise I'm a doctor." But eventually I did. I decided I could 
not fight the battle. And if that saved me that inner psychic energy I needed 
to challenge somewhere else, then it was worth it.

TIMES POLL SHOWS GAP OF PERCEPTION; 
</P>
<P>
BLACKS, JEWS FEEL BIAS IN COUNTY, SURVEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Blacks and Jews in Southern California say there is more discrimination against 
them in Orange County than anywhere else in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents, however, do not perceive a lot of prejudice in their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, people who live in the county rank prejudice lowest on a list of 
problems facing the county, and most say conditions for blacks in Southern 
California are good today and bound to get better. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the findings of a Los Angeles Times Poll that surveyed 
attitudes last month in Orange County and throughout Southern California as 
part of a special project on racial, ethnic and religious differences. (See 
Toward Equality, a special section in today's Times.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crime, Drugs Ranked Highest 
</P>
<P>
When asked to name the biggest problem facing Southern California today, Orange 
County residents ranked crime and drugs highest. Unemployment, moral decline, 
the economy, the budget deficit, AIDS and foreign trade were all mentioned more 
often than prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
From a statistical standpoint, the responses of the 206 people polled in Orange 
County were not significantly different for the most part from the 1,116 Los 
Angeles County residents or from the 794 respondents who live in other parts of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, said he thought the poll's finding that blacks and Jews rate the 
county as highly prejudiced was based more on the area's history than current 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Orange County gets a bad rap," said Kennedy, whose commission oversees 
race and ethnic relations. "I think there is an ancient history of Orange 
County that is different from today." 
</P>
<P>
The county no longer is a homogenized bedroom community but a "growingly 
diverse, urbanized area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The perception of old, that Orange County is an extremely bigoted place where 
racism thrives, is not an accurate picture of what exists today," Kennedy said. 
"I don't mean to downplay the fact that there is racism and bigotry, as there 
is in other places, but I don't think it is any more here." 
</P>
<P>
The poll suggests that, like their Southern California neighbors, Orange County 
residents appear to be more prejudiced against blacks than any other minority 
group, followed by Latinos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitism Discounted 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Semitism is not a sizable problem in the county, according to the poll, 
despite the reputation Orange County apparently has among Southland Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Asked which groups suffer the most bias, the majority named blacks first, 
followed closely by Latinos. Asians were mentioned as a distant third, and just 
4% mentioned Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Most discrimination occurs in housing, followed closely by work situations, 
dealings with police and social contacts, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Prejudice is something people are taught, the majority believes, and education 
was the most-mentioned remedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think younger people are not so concerned" with race and ethnic differences, 
said Carol Travis of Costa Mesa, who participated in the poll. "I think each 
generation is becoming more aware and less prejudiced." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said he believes that, as Anglos interact with more minorities, they 
see the diversity within each minority group, and prejudices and stereotypes 
break down. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contact Reduces Fear, He Says 
</P>
<P>
"There are right-wing, conservative blacks and liberal blacks, as there are 
conservative Hispanics and liberal Hispanics -- the same as in the Asian 
community and the Anglo community," he said. "Those minorities you have the 
most contact with, you have the least fear of." 
</P>
<P>
Like their Southern California neighbors, Orange County residents participating 
in the poll indicated that they do not believe blacks are intellectually 
inferior or that they prefer to be on welfare, and nearly three-quarters either 
approve of or do not care about interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some responses from county residents suggest that either less 
discrimination occurs in the largely Anglo community here or that county 
residents are blind to their prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 48% said they do not believe many people miss out on jobs or 
promotions because of discrimination -- significantly differing from Los 
Angeles County and other regions, where only about a third of the people polled 
said they do not believe that prejudice in the workplace exists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Understanding the Anger 
</P>
<P>
And 44% of those surveyed in Orange County said they do not understand the 
anger of minority groups in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Either there is a lack of awareness, or there is a lack of anything to be 
aware of," Los Angeles Times Poll director I. A. Lewis said of the county 
responses to the questions. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy suggested that the poll may have turned up more awareness of job 
discrimination in Los Angeles because the sampling there included more 
minorities. "Those who are not victims of job discrimination, namely Anglos, 
are usually not aware of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, a county Latina who was questioned in the survey and agreed to be 
interviewed but did not want to be identified, said discrimination on the job 
certainly does exist here. 
</P>
<P>
A savvy, articulate woman who is trying to start a business of her own, Mary 
said she was once an executive secretary and was repeatedly passed over for 
promotions despite her abilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prejudice Seen in Subtle Acts 
</P>
<P>
"It's more subtle these days," she said. "It's a bit more sophisticated in how 
they use it (discrimination). They're not breaking any laws. . . . It's 
something that can't be proven, but if they feel this isn't where you belong, 
in certain positions, they'll move others up . . . and usually they're not 
Hispanic or Latino." 
</P>
<P>
She also once worked for an executive search firm, she said, where the resumes 
of people with Latino surnames rarely got attention. 
</P>
<P>
There is subtle discrimination against Asians too, said J. J. Lee, a 
Chinese-American who lives in Irvine and participated in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while he will see a bumper sticker depicting Asians as bad 
drivers, or hear of someone yelling at an Asian immigrant to go home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that they (Anglos) like Chinese food, but they are not ready to 
let their children marry Chinese people yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Much on Minority Rights 
</P>
<P>
Of the county residents surveyed, 61% said they hear too much about the rights 
of minorities and not enough about the rights of the majority, significantly 
more than the 48% who expressed that view in Los Angeles County. And one out of 
four Orange County residents said government pays too much attention to the 
problems of minorities; one out of five took that view throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Of county respondents, 60% said they believe there are too many immigrants in 
Southern California today. 
</P>
<P>
But Mary said people should remember their origins before they say that. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us came from the United States to begin with," she said. "If you think 
back to 1776, the only people who were here first were the Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Still, one out of four in Orange County said the influence of immigrants has 
changed Southern California for the better. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anglos Becoming the Minority 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I see an enrichment from immigrants," said Peter Briscoe of Cypress, 
himself an immigrant who was surveyed in the poll. Briscoe, who is Caucasian, 
left Zimbabwe, formerly called Rhodesia, in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Population data shows that Anglos will soon be in the minority in Southern 
California. About a third of the people surveyed said they are bothered a lot 
or some by that prediction, while 66% said it disturbs them only a little or 
not at all. 
</P>
<P>
One in five county residents said they would be upset some or a lot if a large 
number of blacks moved into their neighborhoods. But when the question was 
asked another way -- whether their neighbors would be upset if blacks moved in 
-- a much larger segment, 53%, said they would. 
</P>
<P>
The responses to the second question suggest that residents may share those 
beliefs themselves and not want to admit it, poll director Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
When the same questions were asked about other minority groups, the gaps 
narrowed. In the county, 26% said they would be upset if Asians moved in, and 
38% said their neighbors would be. Asked about Latinos moving in, 23% said they 
would be upset, and 27% said their neighbors would be. Asked about Jews, 11% 
said they would be upset, and 11% said their neighbors would be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Upset the Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
Briscoe said he would not personally be upset if large numbers of minorities 
moved into his area but has sensed that his neighbors would be. "There's a 
concern for property values and a concern about gangs and drugs" associated 
with minorities, he said, "and generally a lowering of standards." 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of race and intelligence, 95% of those surveyed in Orange County 
said blacks are as intelligent as whites, a response significantly higher than 
the 88% who took that view in Los Angeles County and the 90% for Southern 
California as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 74% said they do not believe blacks prefer welfare; the 
figure was 66% in Los Angeles. And 22% of those surveyed in Orange County said 
they approve of interracial marriage, while 49% said they did not care. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about anti-Semitism, 59% of those surveyed in Orange County disagreed 
with the statement that Jews have brought prejudice on themselves, while 26% -- 
slightly lower than in Los Angeles -- said they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Attention Needed 
</P>
<P>
Travis, who used to teach at an all-black school in Los Angeles, said that for 
conditions -- housing, social acceptance, education and job opportunities -- to 
improve, minority children need additional attention. 
</P>
<P>
If they come from impoverished homes, their parents may not be able to give 
them the push they need, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Blacks don't have that many opportunities," she said. "I saw it there (in 
school). . . . They needed extra help. They weren't nurtured. I had a lot of 
students whose parents didn't care. But they didn't know how to care." 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for Latinos, according to Mary, the former executive secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of opportunities, but as far as being encouraged (to take 
advantage of them), they need to be pushed more, perhaps because they have been 
pushed back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latinos 'Fall Into a Rut' 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like they (Latino children) fall into a certain rut. . . . We are 
only now looking at ourselves as professionals, that we are just as capable and 
we don't have to bow our heads." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to language, county residents do not welcome efforts to cater to 
immigrants. Just 11% said stores should display signs in foreign languages, 47% 
were opposed to such signs and 41% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic language should be English," Mary said. "I don't care for those 
signs. It makes it confusing for a Mexican kid to be seeing a Chinese sign, 
going to an English-speaking school and speaking Spanish at home." 
</P>
<P>
"When they come to America, they should learn to speak English," Briscoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Having lived in countries where more than one language is recognized, he is 
aware of the costs, he said: "If you cater to every group, it becomes 
prohibitively expensive." 
</P>
<P>
More -- 46% -- favored foreign-language books in public libraries, although one 
in five were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

TIMES POLL ON DISCRIMINATION ORANGE COUNTY RESPONSES 
</P>
<P>
Status of Minorities 
</P>
<P>
"This question is about *(minorities) in Orange County and their ability to get 
adequate housing and education and job opportunities and social acceptance by 
whites, and things like that. Generally speaking, do you think conditions for 
(minorities) in Southern California are good or bad?" 
</P>
<P>
"Thinking of 10 years ago, would you say conditions for (minorities) were good 
or bad?" 
</P>
<P>
"And what do you think conditions for (minorities) in Orange County will be 10 
years from now -- good or bad?" 
</P>
<P>
* Question asked of blacks, Latinos and Asians.

Generally light snow was scattered around the Great Lakes and in parts of the 
West, with light rain in the southern plains. Wind picked up moisture from Lake 
Ontario and produced "lake effect" snow across northern New York state. Snow 
also fell in Upper Michigan and central New York state. Snow showers extended 
from southern Idaho across northern Nevada, Utah, eastern Colorado and 
southeastern Wyoming, and from northwestern Kansas into Nebraska. Up to 5 
inches of snow fell near Cedar City, Utah. Two inches were reported at Grand 
Junction, Colo., and 1 inch of snow fell at Salt Lake City; Syracuse, N.Y., and 
Mt. Washington, N.H.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most recent Los Angeles Times Poll consisted of more than 80 questions 
asked of a scientific sampling of 2,116 people in Southern California, 
including 206 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted Jan. 12-14 by telephone interviewers, some of them 
speaking Spanish. The sampling in Orange County was too small to break down the 
responses by race or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error from chance variations in the sample was 3 points for the 
responses from all of Southern California. For Orange County, it was 8 points, 
and it was 4 points for Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error accounts for differences that would have been discovered if 
every person had been interviewed.

<P>
On a wall in his island home on Puget Sound, Michael Taylor hung a picture of 
himself posing in front of posters of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
Police who searched the place saw it as an expression of an ambition, which 
they found unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like it would make his life to be on that 10 Most Wanted list," said 
Newport Beach Police Detective John Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Taylor may be a candidate for just such a distinction. He is the target 
of an intense nationwide manhunt that began last November when he and four 
other inmates escaped from the Orange County Jail by rappelling from the roof 
of the four-story structure with a rope of braided bed sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, authorities concluded that Taylor was the mastermind of the 
daring jailbreak. Almost 3 months later, he is the only one of the five 
escapees who is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has a reputation as a self-confident thrill seeker who has been an 
extraordinarily successful outlaw because he is also intelligent and a 
perfectionist. The jail breakout, like other brazen escapes in his past, fit 
the profile. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that Taylor, 35, has made a career out of armed jewelry robberies 
and that he goes about it like a corporate employee bucking for a promotion. 
He's usually well dressed -- sometimes in a three-piece suit -- and he uses 
rented, full-sized American cars for getaways. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, police say, Taylor committed yet another bold robbery, holding up a 
jewelry store near Chicago in which he and an accomplice made off with about 
$450,000 in gems. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that his picture is being passed around at police roll calls all over 
the country -- including his native Chicago -- has not seemed to deter him. In 
fact, the element of high risk is almost part of Taylor's signature. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, police estimate, Taylor has stolen about $2 million in jewels from 
almost two dozen Southern California stores, including seven in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the adrenalin-charged minutes of the robberies, police say, it is Taylor who 
barks assignments to his partners, keeps track of the clock and quickly gathers 
the loot. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not an emotional robber," said Jack Price, owner of Designer Jewelers 
Inc. in Huntington Beach, who was the victim last year of a $450,000 holdup 
allegedly committed by Taylor. "It's a business for him. I was in the Army 
Rangers in Vietnam, and we were taught to do everything click, click, click; he 
was that kind of a methodical guy. He knew what he was doing . . . and he was 
good at it." 
</P>
<P>
What police fear most is Taylor's cool temperament and cold-blooded character. 
He has never been charged with shooting anyone, although police say he has been 
armed in all of the robberies he has pulled -- and two of the Orange County 
heists erupted into shoot-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a potentially dangerous person -- there's no doubt about it," said 
Huntington Beach Police Detective Tom Gilligan. 
</P>
<P>
Both the authorities and inmates who knew Taylor in jail distinguish this man 
from most people in the system. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't drink and he doesn't use drugs, they say. He has a middle-class life 
style with a live-in girlfriend and two kids, one of which he fathered. After 
the string of robberies in Southern California, the family moved into a 
waterfront house on Vashon Island in Washington state with a hot tub on the 
rear deck and a private dock. 
</P>
<P>
Police who searched the house found -- in addition to the photograph on the 
wall -- an aquarium in which the gravel was sprinkled with stolen rubies. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is glib, friendly and a master at assuming fake identities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fake Identities 
</P>
<P>
He has used numerous fake identification cards, including one that said he is 
an employee of a bogus company called the Criminal Research Assn. in Chicago. 
Another pictures him as the owner of the California Home Improvement Co. in 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who has been known to carry an 18-karat gold handgun, assumed the alias 
of Anthony Gianetti so effectively that some police departments still don't 
know his real name. The Orange County Sheriff's Department released the 
Gianetti alias when he escaped from jail. His former jail mates still call him 
Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"I would probably describe him as the kind of person you'd find selling 
automobiles or real estate," said Huntington Beach Sgt. William Van Cleve. 
"He's very outgoing, very friendly and he has a tendency to be charming in a 
phony way." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Detective John Desmond tracked Taylor for months, and 
traveled to Washington for the search of his home. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's not driven like a lot of guys are because they're addicted to 
drugs," Desmond said. "He's doing the best way he knows to make money; he's 
just going about his business. And he's good at what he does. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if his ego is so big that he does it for notoriety too, but 
that's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Doubt of Mastermind 
</P>
<P>
When they heard Taylor was involved in the escape last Nov. 20, detectives 
Gilligan and Desmond had no doubt that he was the mastermind. Desmond said 
Taylor had boasted that he was going to break out. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney had told Taylor he was facing more than 40 years in 
prison for the seven Orange County robberies, and Los Angeles prosecutors were 
planning to charge him with an additional 10 armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was in a five-man cell in the Orange County Jail along with two other 
inmates involved in the escape, Steven Wilson and Richard Fluharty. Sources 
said the two other inmates who broke out with Taylor, Wilson and Fluharty were 
not involved in planning the escape but joined in at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
One of those two broke his leg when he fell from the roof because the makeshift 
rope ripped on barbed, razor-wire. He was captured outside the jail that night. 
The other, who was in jail facing a murder charge, turned himself in on 
Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
The five inmates involved in the escape made off from a rooftop recreation area 
after cutting through a chain-link fence. Contrary to policy, they were not 
searched for weapons or tools before being taken to the recreation area that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deputies Miscounted 
</P>
<P>
And, as the Orange County grand jury found later, the deputies on duty at the 
jail that night miscounted the 68 inmates as they left the roof, so the escape 
was not discovered for several hours. A neighborhood caller told police he had 
seen men running down the street in jail clothing. 
</P>
<P>
The two deputies assigned to the rooftop area that night are still on 
administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal Sheriff's Department 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
After their escape, Wilson, Fluharty and Taylor stripped to their shorts and 
convinced a bystander that they needed a ride to a hospital. Once inside the 
car, police said, the escapees displayed a jail-made knife and threw the driver 
out of the car. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Wilson and Fluharty were arrested in Denver with the same 
getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
For Taylor, it may have been his most daring escape, but it only added to a 
longtime reputation. After Taylor's arrest in Huntington Beach, police there 
considered him so slippery that they warned the Sheriff's Department, which 
runs the county jail, in writing: "Given a chance, he will escape." 
</P>
<P>
"Escape is kind of his middle name," Desmond said later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jumped From Car 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Taylor had eluded Seattle police who spotted him on a ferry. Police 
say Taylor escaped during a chase by jumping from his car while turning the 
wheel over to his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, police say, he slipped away from the Border Patrol in New 
Mexico when he was stopped at a checkpoint while driving a stolen pickup truck. 
He ran more than 10 miles across the desert before police search dogs found him 
buried in the dirt trying to hide from helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also escaped from California's Chino state prison in 1975 while he was 
serving a sentence for an armed robbery committed when he was 21. 
</P>
<P>
His history of escapes has caused some to question whether he should have been 
treated as a greater security risk at the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
There are four security categories in the jail that are designated by colored 
wristbands worn by the inmates. A white band calls for minimum security, and 
the grade increases through yellow, orange and red. Red-banded inmates are 
isolated from the rest of the prison population. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor wore an orange band. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Discuss Security 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Richard Olson said that overcrowding at the jail prevents the 
department from designating very many red-band prisoners. But he would not say 
whether the overcrowding was a factor in classifying Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"The security is something that we generally don't talk about," Olson said. 
"All I can say is that I don't want to get into that." 
</P>
<P>
The search for Taylor now involves dozens of police agencies across the 
country, including the FBI. The day he allegedly staged the robbery last week, 
Chicago's rank-and-file police officers had just been shown his picture and 
heard a lecture about his typical "method of operation." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his cunning, police say, he is going to be difficult to capture. But 
also, partly because of his confidence, they are convinced he will be caught. 
</P>
<P>
"He is certainly brazen," said Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Barry. "It's 
going to be difficult to catch him . . . he's obviously very transient -- from 
Los Angeles to Seattle to New Mexico -- but I don't doubt that he'll make a 
mistake somewhere along the road."

PEABODY DEVELOPS A CRASH PROGRAM TO MAKE HIS MARK AT LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be a basketball floor to you, but it's a 94-by-50-foot hunk of 
slip-and-slide hijinks to Tom Peabody, Loyola Marymount's human bruise, the 
possessed pursuer of loose basketballs, the guy who just landed on the elderly 
gentleman sitting in the third row. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody runs into benches, flops over press tables and body-bludgeons 
unsuspecting cheerleaders. So wild, so rambunctious are his on-court antics 
that his teammates have dubbed him Damien and The Terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch him play," said Delores Peabody, his mother, "and I just have to ask 
myself, 'My goodness, is this necessary?' " 
</P>
<P>
If you think that's just a mother's concern, consider the wide eyes of Barry 
Zepel, Loyola's sports information director, who has watched Peabody, a former 
Mater Dei High School point guard, do his self-destructo act all season. 
</P>
<P>
"The way he plays, you can't help but admire him," Zepel said. "Still, you 
don't want the kid to die because of it." 
</P>
<P>
For all the abuse Peabody piles on himself, not to mention folding chairs, 
you'd figure he'd reward himself with his share of shots. There's plenty to be 
had. Loyola is the nation's No. 1 scoring team, having set virtually every 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I scoring record this season. The 
Lions scored a record 181 points against United States International University 
Jan. 31, allowing a record 150, a record total for a losing team, in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"On this team," said reserve forward John O'Connell, "if you catch the ball, 
then it's time to give it a ride." 
</P>
<P>
But Peabody, who has played in all 23 games for Loyola and started 18 at small 
forward because of an injury to starter Bo Kimble, has attempted only 82 shots, 
an average of little more than three a game. Consider that Kimble has taken 
more than 100 and has played in only 10 games. Terrell Lowery, reserve point 
guard, has taken almost twice as many shots (130) as Peabody, even though he 
has played barely half as many minutes, 295 to Peabody's 510. 
</P>
<P>
In the USIU point orgy, Peabody scored five. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to shooting, Tom is the team oddball," said Paul Westhead, 
Loyola coach. "His (shooting) mechanics are fine. But he's so consumed with the 
total game -- with passing and playing defense and jumping on the loose ball -- 
that shooting just passes him by. While the other guys are calculating where 
their next shot is coming from, Tom is busy exploding all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
So Mr. Peabody is in the middle of Shooters' Heaven -- a place that lives by 
Westhead's "If you're going to miss 49 (shots), why not miss 50?" -- and he has 
decided that the way he'll stay there is by being everything but a shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it doesn't matter if I miss 20 straight shots here," Peabody said. "But 
what I do is play defense as hard as I can, try and make steals, get the ball 
to the open man and take the pressure off the guys who are scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll be wide open and I'll pass the ball and the coaches will just 
shake their heads. They want me to shoot more and they get kind of frustrated. 
But I'd rather give the ball to Hank (Gathers, the nation's leading scorer and 
rebounder) and watch him deal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way I know how to play, I couldn't play any other way." 
</P>
<P>
Peabody is second on the team in steals (38), third in blocks (nine) and 
assists (73) and is Loyola's unquestioned king of pain. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, he hits the floor so hard that the guys on the bench will just put 
their heads down and close their eyes," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
American Cable, which broadcasts Loyola games locally, has taken to 
superimposing Peabody's body-abuse stats rather than his scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Peabody: 
</P>
<P>
 Floor burns per game: 9.5 
</P>
<P>
 Floor burns tonight: 5 
</P>
<P>
Besides burns, there are scars, scabs, bumps, bruises and stitches that form a 
relief map of one basketball player's journey, one that almost came to an 
abrupt end Thanksgiving Day, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody didn't begin playing basketball until the eighth grade, but getting 
dinged up was nothing new. Growing up, he committed the ultimate offensive foul 
and broke his jaw in so doing, when he rode his bike into a wall that had 
established position. There were countless other minor injuries as well as 
"stitches all over my head." 
</P>
<P>
Peabody said his parents were "always worried that someone was going to see 
this kid all beat up and bring them up on child-abuse charges." 
</P>
<P>
Though lacking in basketball experience, Peabody's athletic prowess was such 
that by his junior year he was the starting point guard for the Mater Dei team 
that went 29-0 and won the Southern Section 5-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, with Peabody again at the point, Mater Dei won another 
Southern Section title. Even then his scoring stats were anemic -- he averaged 
six points a game as a senior -- partly because in his two years as a starter 
he played with the likes of Tom Lewis (now at Pepperdine, by way of USC), Mike 
Mitchell (Colorado State, by way of Fresno State) and LeRon Ellis (Kentucky). 
</P>
<P>
"There were so many options," Peabody said. "There never was any pressure on me 
to score, which was fine." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's tendency to set up in a half-court offense did nothing to endear 
him to run-and-gun Loyola, the school that Peabody wanted most to recruit him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought his style was suited to a slower game," Westhead said. 
</P>
<P>
Peabody went to Rice, which became an immediate disaster. A good student, he 
graduated from Mater Dei with a 3.7 grade-point average, Peabody failed his 
first four tests. He couldn't play basketball after he sustained stress 
fractures in his foot and shin; his father, Pete, was ill with a weak heart, 
and he flat out missed home. 
</P>
<P>
By Thanksgiving of his freshman year, he had had enough and headed home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like being in shock," he said. "When I left Mater Dei, everything was 
as perfect as it could be; three months later it had all fallen apart." 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled at Orange Coast College and went about raising his grades and 
getting as far away from basketball as he could. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the lowest I've ever seen him," said Terry Peabody, his brother. "He 
reached this crisis where he was searching for his identity. He'd always been a 
good student and a good basketball player and now he wasn't sure about either." 
</P>
<P>
Peabody said: "My confidence was completely gone." 
</P>
<P>
As his grades started to rise at OCC, so did his desire to play basketball. By 
spring, he was "chomping at the bit," to get back on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Figuring he had blown his one chance at Division I basketball, he prepared 
himself to play two years at OCC, then drop basketball completely and get his 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
Playing on a summer league team that needed him to score, Peabody was averaging 
20 points a game. One day he got a call from Judas Prada, Loyola assistant in 
charge of recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"When the call came from Loyola, the sun came back out for Tom," Terry said. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead arranged to come down and watch him play. Peabody had torn the 
ligaments in his right foot and had been advised not to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the doctor to either tape it or show me how to tape it, because I had 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
And played well enough that Westhead offered him a scholarship. Peabody sat out 
last year and has two seasons of eligibility after this one. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here, Coach (Westhead) called me in and said, 'Not many people get 
a second chance; you've got yours, now do something with it,' " Peabody said. 
"The bottom line is that I'm playing, and I'm playing because I go all out. 
It's the only way I know how to play, I couldn't play any other way." 
</P>
<P>
Which bodes well for Loyola and its fans, well, those who steer clear of 
courtside seats.

TITAN BREAKDOWNS ALLOW STANFORD TO SALVAGE SERIES FINALE, 11-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As self-destructions go, the Cal State Fullerton baseball team did a pretty 
solid job Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans made five errors and allowed three runs to score on wild pitches in 
an 11-8 nonconference loss to Stanford in front of about 1,000 spectators and 
an ESPN television audience at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton started with a six-run first inning, and the Titans still led, 8-5, 
before a mistake-filled eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Troy Paulson, a sophomore from La Quinta High School, had a two-run 
double down the left-field line to cut the Fullerton lead to 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
Paulson scored on a two-out single by Tim Griffin. Trevor Neighbors, the 
Fullerton right fielder, had the ball go off his glove for an error. When his 
throw to second base bounced away, he was charged with another error, and 
Griffin was able to reach third base. 
</P>
<P>
He scored on wild pitch by Chris Robinson to give Stanford a 9-8 lead. Robinson 
(2-1), working in relief, took the loss for Fullerton (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Stanford added two more runs in the ninth off three Fullerton pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Steve Chitren, a senior right-hander, worked the final 3 2/3 
innings, allowing only a hit and no runs for the victory. He is 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Stanford victory prevented a Fullerton sweep of the three-game series. 
Fullerton won, 3-2, Friday and 5-2 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud that we came back after falling behind in the first," Stanford 
Coach Mark Marquess said. "There was a lot of adversity for those kids and they 
hung in there." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's first-inning runs came on an RBI double by Rex Peters, a two-run 
double by Dave Staton, and run-scoring singles by Rich Gonzales, Randy Graves 
and Eddie Lample. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford took advantage of some Fullerton mistakes to get back in the game in 
the second and third innings. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford had runners on first and second after a single and an error by 
shortstop Graves. Jack Hollis then grounded to second baseman Mate Borgogno, 
who threw to Graves for a force at second. But Graves' throw to first was wild, 
allowing a run to score. Hollis moved to third on a fielder's choice and scored 
on a wild pitch by starter Paul Johnson to cut the lead to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Hollis had a bunt single to score Griffin in the fourth. Griffin had reached on 
a two-out error by third baseman Ramirez and moved to third on consecutive 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased being able to take two of three," Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell 
said. "If you look at the whole series, we did a lot of things well. Tonight, 
we just had some breakdowns defensively."

Anjie Bryant and Ann Van Dortrecht each pitched three-hit shutouts as Cal State 
Fullerton swept Cal State Northridge, 4-0 and 1-0, in a nonconference softball 
doubleheader Sunday at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
In the opener, Bryant, a sophomore left-hander, struck out two and allowed only 
two balls out of the infield. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (2-0) scored three runs in the first inning and added another in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton loaded the bases in the first on two walks and a hit batter off 
Northridge's Heather Lindstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Ann Hartwig's single and an error by left fielder Pam Smith quickly 
cleared the bases, however, giving Fullerton all the runs it would need. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton collected four runs, two unearned, and five hits in four innings 
against Lindstrom. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton scored its only run of the second game on Missy Coombes' first-inning 
single. Van Dortrecht struck out nine and walked only one. RALPH NICHOLS

JEAN COCTEAU COLLECTION AT UC IRVINE REVEALS A LIVELY BUT DISTINCTLY MINOR 
TALENT

"Fame is the consequence of a misunderstanding. It is like the crowd which 
gathers around the scene of an accident.... A few people stop and wonder what 
is happening. Others imitate them, question them. Then comes the crowd, which 
no longer sees anything.... Since everyone invents the accident, no one knows 
what has happened. Gradually the accident is distorted...." 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old Jean Cocteau made this observation in his diary on Feb. 3, 
1952, when he was (as usual) feeling persecuted by his critics. Poet, 
playwright, ballet librettist and stage designer, film maker, novelist, 
essayist, poster and stained-glass designer, illustrator, painter -- Cocteau 
was an aesthetic honeybee, buzzing between each of the arts to create a 
rarefied nectar of his own. 
</P>
<P>
A look at his visual art -- a portion of which is on view at the UC Irvine Fine 
Arts Gallery (through Sunday) in a Cocteau Centenary show drawn from the 
collection of Irvine's Severin Wunderman Museum -- reveals a lively but 
distinctly minor talent. Despite the mighty trumpetings of the Wunderman 
Museum, any cult fame that may cling to Cocteau purely on account of his art is 
indeed "the consequence of a misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
It seems perfectly in character that by far his best works were the caricatures 
he dashed off as a young man. Cocteau's witty sensibility was equipped with a 
radar for seeking out gifted kindred spirits, and his drawings reflect the 
circles in which he traveled. But, as is so often true of such highly refined 
sensibilities, he blossomed early and became impotently repetitious and 
derivative with age. 
</P>
<P>
One of the earliest (1909) of his quickie portraits in the exhibit is of Sarah 
Bernhardt at 65. The 20-year-old Cocteau -- who would always prefer profile 
views -- mercilessly notes the famous actress's double chin as well as her 
famous pompadour of frizzed hair and the rings on each of her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Cocteau drew the violinist and composer Niccolo Paganini as an attenuated 
skeleton; the French composer Georges Auric, with a huge chin, wearing a bowler 
hat and toting an umbrella like an Englishman; the painter and stage designer 
Leon Bakst as a big-beaked bird wearing eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
In one sketch, the imposing bulk of Ballets Russes impresario Serge Diaghilev 
dwarfs dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, devastatingly caricatured as a puppet by means 
of three well-placed vertical lines. 
</P>
<P>
A few quick lines give us pianist Artur Rubinstein's self-satisfied smirk, 
proud nose and puffed-out chest. A more elaborate drawing shows composer Igor 
Stravinsky with a zombie-like mask-face, his long fingers tensely holding his 
place in a book. Cocteau's notes on the paper explain that he is visiting the 
house of Coco Chanel (the couturiere) and she is singing badly in the next 
room. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few other works of interest. 
</P>
<P>
One is the poster Cocteau designed for the 1911 Ballets Russes production of 
"Le Spectre de la Rose," with the strong image of ballerina Tamara Karsavina's 
full skirt billowing backward. Another is the intriguingly conceptual drawing, 
"Le Sens du Futur" (the direction of the future) from 1929, which -- with its 
image of an antique sculpture bust holding a pair of disembodied legs -- 
suggests the sense of despair that haunted Cocteau in the year his opium 
addiction bottomed out and Diaghilev died, dissolving the Ballets Russes. 
</P>
<P>
Cocteau's imaginative resources also lent themselves to the design of a 
tapestry (realized in infinitesimal detail by a French atelier in 1948). The 
subject is Judith carrying the head of Holophernes, a biblical theme that takes 
on something of the hallucinatory quality of Cocteau's films. 
</P>
<P>
As he wrote about the scene in his diary, "Like a Jewish ghost (Judith) passes 
through the groups of guards, who are sleeping in the moonlight. On the upper 
right her servant, like some sort of insect, casts a last glance into the room 
where the beheading took place." 
</P>
<P>
But despite his complex work for stage and film based on the myths and 
literature of ancient Greece, his efforts at creating Neoclassical motifs in 
paint and pastel from the 1950s tend to come across as facile, repetitive 
doodles of pretty boys, derivative of Picasso's mythological lithographs but 
lacking their sting and panache. 
</P>
<P>
"Visage Grec Ancien" (face of an ancient Greek) is little more than a 
large-scale version of Cocteau's standard idealized male facial type, done in 
oil paint on canvas instead of pen on paper. In "Femme Endormie" (sleeping 
woman), blocks of color create the contours of a face -- a tired, watered-down 
interpretation of Cubist and Fauve techniques already decades old. The two 
versions of "The Lovers" -- big, schematic heads absorbed in the activity of 
French-kissing -- are simply embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
Cocteau leans heavily on Picasso in "Madame Favini and her Daughter," a 
caricature in paint based on the bored women and fractious children Cocteau 
encountered in the drawing rooms of the wealthy. Outfitted in a huge-collared 
dress decorated with little doodles (decoratively gouged out of the paint), the 
lady reclines dreamily while her offspring amuses herself with a Flit insect 
exterminator. A humdrum seascape hanging on the wall satirizes the fictional 
Mme. Favini's aesthetic taste. 
</P>
<P>
Granted the charm of his small-scale work, Cocteau seems to have lacked the 
creative independence -- as well as the technical gifts -- necessary to create 
major works of art. His more ambitious attempts are overly precious and 
superficial, like intimate jokes never meant to extend beyond his circle of 
intimates. 
</P>
<P>
The Severin Wunderman Museum, which is dedicated to Cocteau's work, takes its 
name from the chairman of the board of Severin Montres Ltd., a manufacturer and 
distributor of Gucci watches in whose offices the museum is located. In fact, 
Wunderman has seen fit to reproduce (as promotional materials describe it) 
"Cocteau's legendary Orpheus" -- a profile of the Greek god and a minimal 
sketch of his lyre -- on the faces of a line of pricey watches and clocks. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, perhaps that's the way Cocteau's supreme style-consciousness is 
best marketed to the style-conscious '80s: as something expensive, vaguely 
"cultural" and just begging for the kind of mindless gushing to which the 
social-column set are prone. 
</P>
<P>
 Work by Cocteau from the Severin Wunderman Museum will be shown at the UC 
Irvine Fine Arts Gallery through Feb. 19 in conjunction with the Jean Cocteau 
Centenary Festival. Gallery hours are noon to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

An aunt of Gov. Joe Frank Harris, found slain in her home over the weekend, was 
strangled, perhaps by a robber, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Allie Morrow Roper, 75, a sister of Harris' mother, Frances Morrow Harris, was 
found dead Sunday morning after she failed to pick up neighbors for church. The 
woman, who lived alone, apparently was killed Saturday night, police said. She 
was found unclothed and bound. The Harris family was "in shock" over the 
slaying, said Barbara Morgan, spokeswoman for the governor.

SAN DIEGO FWY TO CLOSE OVERNIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway between the Santa Ana and Corona 
del Mar freeways will be closed at 9 p.m. tonight for construction work, 
Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The closure is needed so crews can install so-called K-rails, the concrete 
barriers that separate traffic from construction work, officials said. The 
northbound lanes are scheduled to reopen at 5 a.m. Tuesday. The Santa Ana 
Freeway will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
The closure on the San Diego Freeway is part of a widening project that 
includes installation of car-pool lanes. A five-mile segment of the northbound 
car-pool lane is already open from the Springdale Street bridge in Westminster 
to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Seal Beach. The entire project is scheduled 
for completion in July, 1990.

HUNTINGTON BEACH MAN FLEES POLICE; 150-MILE CHASE ENDS IN THE OCEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man led authorities on 150-mile chase over 10 freeways in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties early this morning before driving his red 
Camaro into the ocean off the Huntington Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Sheriff's Department boat plucked James Hamilton, 23, from the 
chilly water about 5:20 a.m., as he clung to a pier support, CHP Lt. Jerry 
Jewett said. Hamilton was taken to a hospital for treatment of hypothermia and 
scrapes on his stomach. He was arrested on suspicion of evading police and 
damaging city property. 
</P>
<P>
Brea police officers began pursuing Hamilton about 2:45 a.m. on the southbound 
Orange Freeway because they believed that his car was involved with a murder 
investigation, Jewett said. Brea police lost sight of Hamilton, and CHP 
officers continued the pursuit at speeds of up to 105 m.p.h.

NORTH LAWYER REJECTS PACT, SAYS IT 'GUTS THE DEFENSE';

Lawyers for Oliver L. North said in a court filing released today that they 
would be unable to defend him adequately under a proposed agreement to control 
the use of classified material North wants to use in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed agreement "would gut the defense and guarantee a 'cuckoo-clock' 
trial that would make a mockery of the adversarial process," said North's 
lawyer, Brendan Sullivan. He said that, without the information he wants to 
present, "we cannot adequately defend this case." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was worked out between the office of independent counsel Lawrence 
B. Walsh, who is prosecuting North, and the Justice Department, which fears 
that North will spill classified material damaging to national security at his 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed order would "gut the defense" by barring North from using 
"critical information about the Reagan Administration's third-country 
arrangements for military support of the (Nicaraguan) Resistance and the 
official non-disclosure of those arrangements," the filing by Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In referring to a "cuckoo-clock" trial, Sullivan was quoting the judge in the 
Iran-Contra case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell. Gesell has made it 
clear that the government's proposed order would have nine categories of 
classified information that should not be revealed at trial before prosecutors 
have had an opportunity to contest its relevance. 
</P>
<P>
They include information identifying undercover CIA officers, the locations of 
CIA stations, identities of foreign individuals who work for the CIA and 
details about CIA operations with foreign intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
Also included would be material about American intelligence collection on 
terrorism and efforts to locate hostages; U.S. covert activities other than 
military support for the Contras, and names of non-Central American countries 
that supported the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the proposed agreement would bar North from offering evidence about 
Central American countries' support for the Contras in exchange for favors from 
the Reagan Administration. Under the agreement, "a candid admission" by the 
government of a quid pro quo arrangement would be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Gesell approves the agreement, Walsh and the Justice Department agree 
that "it will be impossible . . . to protect against disclosure of classified 
information that is of vital importance to the national security and the 
foreign relations of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial could not go forward in this state of uncertainty," Walsh said in a 
motion that outlined the government's proposed order. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said a quid pro quo admission "fails to acknowledge that President 
Reagan and other top Administration officials established a policy that the 
arrangements would not be disclosed outside the Executive Branch." If imposed 
by the court, Sullivan said, that part of the agreement "would cripple the 
defense of this case." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the nine areas of material on which the proposal would impose 
tight controls, Sullivan said that "these open-ended, amorphous categories 
would guarantee that the trial would be a constant bench conference, not a real 
trial."

Fire investigators today said an improperly installed fireplace caused a fire 
which did an estimated $75,000 damage to the home of former National Security 
Adviser Robert C. McFarlane. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out Sunday afternoon at the townhouse of McFarlane and his wife, 
Jonda, in the Georgetown section of the city. No one was injured in the blaze, 
which took 30 minutes to bring under control. McFarlane, who was White House 
national security adviser under former President Ronald Reagan, pleaded guilty 
last year to four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress 
in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.

Government meteorologists called a one-day strike today, leaving the French to 
gaze into the sky and guess at the prospects for rain or snow. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,000 employees of the National Weather Service agreed to provide crucial 
aviation and marine forecasts during the walkout, called to press demands for 
higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
The four unions representing meteorologists conducted a series of meetings in 
December and January with Transport Ministry officials but said the discussions 
were not satisfactory and called the strike to underscore demands for more 
money. A starting meteorologist earns about $1,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Le Monde noted that the strike means "silence on the great 
preoccupation of vacationers and staff at ski resorts: the prospects for snow." 
</P>
<P>
Snow has been scanty this winter in the Alps, causing many resorts to close 
some or all of their ski trails. The latest long-range forecasts, issued 
Sunday, said there was a possibility of scattered snow later this week.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his first diplomatic tour of West 
European capitals, is finding it difficult to compete with the public relations 
blitz of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a senior U.S. official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also is having his problems with West German leaders and their reluctance 
to support the upgrading of NATO's tactical nuclear missiles, the official 
said. But after touching base in six of the 15 allied capitals, Baker's biggest 
problem is Gorbachev and the inroads he has made in Western European public 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just an attraction, an intriguing quality to Gorbachev that you have 
to answer somehow," said the official, who participated in most of the meetings 
Baker has held on his trip. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no answer," the official told reporters as Baker flew back to West 
Germany for talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disarmament Trends 
</P>
<P>
Responding to strong disarmament trends among the German people, Kohl last week 
proposed a delay of two or three years in upgrading the short-range Lance 
missile deployed in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization faces a decision in a few months on 
whether to double the range of the U.S.-built rockets from 70 miles to about 
150 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl told reporters he wants NATO to build into its defense strategy a 
disarmament mandate if the allies go ahead with a plan. 
</P>
<P>
After talking to the chancellor, Baker told reporters that he hoped the issue 
could be settled at a NATO summit meeting, which is being planned for late May 
in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
He said Kohl gave assurances that he was not "backing off" West Germany's 
approval of a NATO declaration last year, saying the allied defense should mix 
nuclear and conventional weapons that "will continue to be kept up to date." 
</P>
<P>
Covering 15 capitals in eight days is testing Baker's endurance. Today, for 
example, was a three-country day with stops in Denmark, Norway and West 
Germany. Tuesday will be no easier, with Baker going to Turkey, Greece and 
Italy.

Federal regulators today took over the operations of Midwest Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan Assn. and announced the resignation of the thrift's chairman, who is 
among the targets of an FBI fraud probe. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines said it had declared Midwest Federal 
insolvent and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. conservator under a 
program announced by President Bush last week. 
</P>
<P>
In the same statement, the home loan bank said Midwest Federal Chairman Harold 
Greenwood Jr. and the thrift's managing officer, Charlotte Massica, resigned. 
U.S. Atty. Jerome Arnold of Minneapolis last week said Greenwood and Massica 
were among the targets of an FBI investigation into possible fraud at Midwest 
Federal. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman C. Connell, president of the Des Moines bank, said in a statement that 
Greenwood resigned because "he needed to focus on personal issues." "Greenwood, 
in cooperation with federal regulators, determined his resignation was in the 
best interests of Midwest Federal," he said.

High-level talks among U.S. government agencies have so far failed to resolve 
trade questions over proposed U.S.-Japanese cooperation on Japan's new FSX 
fighter, Administration officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration is examining a decision made last year by the outgoing 
Reagan Administration, which came after years of wrangling, to let General 
Dynamics Corp. help Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries build a new jet based 
on the General Dynamics' F-16. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the proposed $8-billion deal, including members of Congress, 
have cautioned that the cooperation would give Japanese aerospace industry a 
major boost in its competition with U.S. defense firms. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a meeting held Friday on the FSX included representatives from 
the White House, National Security Council, U.S. Trade Representative's office 
and the State, Defense, Commerce, Labor, Energy and Treasury departments. 
</P>
<P>
Published reports have said questions about the deal are being raised by the 
Commerce Department and the trade representative's office. The Bush 
Administration has not yet sent notification to Congress that it intends to go 
through with the technology transfer deal.

The company had sales of $9 billion in 1988, 12.3% over last year's $8.01 
billion, and earnings of $974 million, 16.9% over the 1987 net of $833 million. 
Earnings per share rose to $5.72 from $4.83. The stock split will be voted on 
at the company's April 26 annual meeting. One additional share would be issued 
for each one held. The dividend would go to 29 cents per share after the split 
as against 50 cents per present share.

U.S. TO SELL TRITIUM DESPITE PINCH

<P>
The Energy Department has decided to continue selling tritium to private 
companies despite what it calls a serious pinch on supplies of the radioactive 
gas used to make nuclear warheads, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the department, through its Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 
Tennessee, sold about 240 grams of tritium to U.S. and foreign companies, and 
this year's sales are projected at 230 grams, department spokesman Phil Keif 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a small piece of the total production," he said, adding that the exact 
total is classified. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of commercial sales of tritium dates back several decades but it 
has come under review by the Energy Department since production was halted last 
spring at the Savannah River Plant -- the government's sole source of the gas.

4 JAPAN EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN STOCK AND BRIBERY SCANDAL

The founder of Recruit Co. and three other businessmen were arrested today in a 
stock-trading scandal that has shaken Japan's governing party and contributed 
to its loss in a special parliamentary election. 
</P>
<P>
Recruit reportedly sold tens of thousands of unlisted shares of stock at 
bargain prices to politicians, their aides and other prominent people. The 
purchasers then profited when the stocks were publicly traded and skyrocketed 
in value. The scandal has also involved direct political donations by Recruit. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they today arrested Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and former chairman 
of the information services conglomerate. Also arrested were a vice president 
of a Recruit subsidiary and two former officials of Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone, Japan's largest company. 
</P>
<P>
The Recruit officials were arrested on suspicion of giving bribes, the two 
Nippon officials in connection with receiving bribes, news reports said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken From Hospital 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Ezoe was taken from a hospital where he had been under 
treatment for exhaustion since the scandal was uncovered last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen other prominent politicians and 
businessmen have since resigned in the scandal, which has led to broader 
questions about political fund-raising and links between business and politics. 
</P>
<P>
The country's largest opposition party, victorious in Sunday's by-election, 
demanded today that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resign or dissolve 
Parliament "so the people can express their will" about the Recruit scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, head of the Japan Socialist Party, told Parliament that her party's 
victory in the election in Fukuoka in southern Japan showed that the public has 
lost faith in the corruption-tainted Takeshita administration. 
</P>
<P>
The balloting was widely seen as a test of the damage done by the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Takeshita refused to dissolve Parliament, which would mean calling new 
elections for its lower house. 
</P>
<P>
"The election (Sunday) showed that people in Fukuoka won't put up with any more 
(of Takeshita's policies)," Doi told cheering opposition lawmakers today. 
"Either the entire Cabinet must resign, or the prime minister must dissolve 
Parliament so the people can express their will." 
</P>
<P>
A dissolution of the Diet, Japan's Parliament, would force an election for the 
lower house, where Takeshita's governing Liberal Democratic Party has more than 
300 of the 512 seats. An election is scheduled in July for half of the seats in 
the upper house, which cannot be dissolved.

Champion Products Inc., a maker of athletic and leisure clothing, has agreed to 
be sold to Sara Lee Corp. of Chicago in a deal valued at $320.9 million, 
Champion officials announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Champion, which saw profits rise 114% last year to $14.8 million, has been 
trying to fight off a hostile takeover attempt by a New York investment group. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Champion and Sara Lee, a $10-billion food and consumer 
products company, calls for a wholly owned subsidiary of Sara Lee to begin 
offering $77 a share for Champion stock this week. 
</P>
<P>
The company said there are 4,167,700 outstanding shares of fully diluted stock, 
including various convertible stock options. 
</P>
<P>
Champion stock on Friday closed at 63 5/8, a record high, on the American Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Phonicam Corp., the New York firm that has been trying to buy Champion since 
1986, has been accumulating the company's stock and offered to buy Champion in 
December at $55 a share. It upped the offer in January to $61.

University of Portland basketball forward Josh Lowery was arrested on an

</P>
<P>
Lowery, 21, of Oakland, was accused of fourth-degree assault after Britta 
Davis, 21, of Longview, Wash., was struck in the face early Sunday during a 
party near the campus, police said. Davis told police she and Lowery had been 
arguing before she was hit. Davis claimed she suffered a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery faces arraignment Feb. 28 in Multnomah County District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, a junior guard, has been "suspended indefinitely until the university 
can conduct a complete investigation of the incident and can tell me why this 
altercation took place," Pilots Coach Larry Steele said.
