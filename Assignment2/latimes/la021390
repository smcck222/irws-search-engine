HAROLD MCCUSKER; PROTESTANT PARTY LEADER IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold McCusker, 50, a schoolteacher who became prominent in Northern Ireland 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the British Parliament for 16 years, representing the 
Official Unionists, the mainstream Protestant party in Northern Ireland. He was 
party deputy leader from 1982. McCusker was an eloquent speaker and campaigner 
for tougher measures against the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to 
rid Northern Ireland of British rule. Like most Northern Ireland Protestants, 
McCusker opposed the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement that gave the Irish Republic a 
say in running the province. But he later became critical of older colleagues 
for failing to come up with an alternative to the pact. In Belfast on Monday of 
cancer.

BOARD DROPS NO-FAIL POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let me cast one vote for board member Julie Korenstein for allowing one 
failure. In my senior year in high school, I took a host of electives in 
addition to my courses in physics, trigonometry, French, etc. 
</P>
<P>
However, I flunked typing, an elective, which put me on the failure list, even 
though I got A's in all of my other courses. Board member Rita Walters' rules 
would have made me drop out of the 12A play, despite my other high grades. 
Punishment would not have helped. I really tried to pass but my fingers 
wouldn't behave. Fortunately, I was allowed to go to college, despite my 
failure and in due time was awarded a Ph.D. A satisfying career in chemical 
research followed. So relax these rules. Nobody is perfect.

PUBLIC BATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout history, man has enjoyed public bathing. He has delighted in laying 
back at a pool, stream, river, hot spring, or ocean, getting clean. 
</P>
<P>
The Roman public baths must have been wonderful. America could use the idea 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of hot water and heat are available at our power plants. Because of the 
nature of the electricity-producing cycle, 65% of the fuel used to produce 
electricity is wasted as heat. That's a lot of waste heat. Clouds of steam can 
be seen rising above our power plants on cold mornings. 
</P>
<P>
So, at a steam plant, we make a nice little park with free showers and washing 
facilities for clothes. Cost would be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers would use the spas. People living in motor homes would. Kids would. 
The homeless would. 
</P>
<P>
Public baths are very civilized things. They are right in line with the 
President's idea of a gentler, kinder America.

COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest edition of Time magazine, it states that in the 115-year history 
of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, there has been only white men 
elected to it. 
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine that? This is the most multiracial county in the nation and yet 
we have the most enduring bastion of white supremacy in the country. 
</P>
<P>
It is also the most undemocratic political entity since it has broad 
legislative, executive and semi-judicial powers unlike any in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we allow this to go on? We need at least nine members to constitute the 
board instead of the present five, to make it more representative of the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
These five are the most power-hungry politicians in Southern California. Even 
the "liberals," Kenneth Hahn and Edmund Edelman, cling to power tenaciously and 
unyieldingly. 
</P>
<P>
Enlarge the board!

A BIG STEP TOWARD LEGITIMATE PLURALISM; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORMERS DID NOT GET ALL THEY WANTED FROM THE 
CENTRAL COMMITTEE SESSION. BUT THEY GOT ENOUGH TO EMERGE THE VICTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The task of describing, never mind analyzing and interpreting, the Soviet 
political system becomes more difficult by the day. It is also, however, 
infinitely more fascinating. Within less than five years the Soviet system has 
moved from being highly authoritarian to one in which a substantial element of 
de facto pluralism exists and in which political pluralism is at last becoming 
legitimized. 
</P>
<P>
A crucial step toward legitimized pluralism was taken last week when the 
Central Committee gave its reluctant agreement to the proposals of Mikhail 
Gorbachev that the Communist Party give up its guaranteed monopoly of power and 
open the way to party competition. A number of political parties other than the 
Communists already exist in some Soviet republics. But now that the way has 
been opened for the Supreme Soviet to rescind Article 6 of the Constitution, 
which made the ascendancy of the Communist Party a significant part of the 
fundamental law of the land, a growth in both the number and size of other 
parties can be expected -- in Russia as well as in the peripheral republics. 
</P>
<P>
One of the major ways in which a competitive party system could emerge in the 
Soviet Union is through a split in the Communist Party itself. Such splits are 
already beginning to occur on an ethnic and territorial basis (with the 
Lithuanians leading the way), but the Party Congress -- which has now been 
advanced from October to this summer -- will bring out as never before the 
fundamental ideological differences within the Communist Party and could hasten 
a division with reformist and conservative wings forming separate parties. 
There could even be a three-way division among radical reformers, centrists and 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his reformist advisers did not get all they wanted in Moscow last 
week. The language of the resolutions was fudged and watered down in order to 
achieve the remarkable feat of getting every Central Committee member except 
Boris Yeltsin to vote for a package that went against the convictions of many 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also wanted -- against all the traditions of the Central Committee -- 
to televise the proceedings of the plenum. This would have made it harder for 
members to defend the Communist Party's monopoly of power and to express their 
distrust of the people, given that the people would be watching. While 
Gorbachev and his allies lost on this point, the speeches of participants in 
the debate have been published in the Soviet press. 
</P>
<P>
Not the least of the points on which Gorbachev had to make a tactical retreat 
was in his desire to ease the path of acceptance of more consistently reformist 
proposals to be presented to the 28th Party Congress by securing the removal of 
at least one of the remaining conservatives on the Politburo. A senior official 
in the ideological department of the Central Committee said at the beginning of 
the week that Gorbachev would remove the conservatives in the leadership "step 
by step" and indicated that a resignation could be expected. It did not happen, 
but there is to be another Central Committee plenum within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev also failed to get the Central Committee reduced from its normal size 
of around 300 members, plus at least half as many candidate members, to a mere 
200 full members. It emerged after the meeting that the revamped Central 
Committee would be a body of between 300 and 400 members. 
</P>
<P>
All this indicates the constraints upon Gorbachev's power and it helps to 
explain why his supporters believe that a strengthened state presidency is 
necessary. One of the fundamentally important points to come out of the plenum 
was acceptance of the need to move to a new-style presidential system in which 
the president would not only have greater powers than accrue to that office at 
present, but would be elected directly by the people. A president elected by 
universal adult suffrage would have a legitimacy and authority that a leader 
who becomes head of state purely on the say-so of a Communist Party forum 
(performing the functions implicit in its "leading role") could not. 
</P>
<P>
The details of the latest political reforms will have to be settled in the 
Soviet legislature -- the Congress of People's Deputies and especially its 
inner body, the Supreme Soviet. But it looks as if a directly and freely 
elected president and competition between political parties in elections to 
both local soviets and national legislatures are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
That is a dramatic change in the Soviet political system. It means that even if 
the reformers did not get all they wanted last week, they emerged the victors. 
Given the problems of everyday life in the Soviet Union, it is not a foregone 
conclusion that Gorbachev will be the winner in a popular election for the 
presidency, but it is highly unlikely that he will be defeated by a more 
conservative Communist candidate. If he were to lose such an election, it most 
likely would be to an advocate of more radical change who was not tainted by 
the compromises forced upon Gorbachev by the need to carry a more conservative 
group of colleagues with him and by the economic failures and intra-ethnic 
unrest that beset him.

<P>
CITY COUNCIL SQUABBLING GUTTED AN EARLIER PROPOSAL; IT CAN REDEEM ITSELF BY 
SENDING THE REFORM PACKAGE TO THE VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WOO, Michael Woo is the chairman of the City Council's Governmental 
Ethics Ad Hoc Committee. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last month's debate on ethics reform did not show the Los Angeles City Council 
at its best. A debate that began in 1989 with Mayor Tom Bradley's 
conflict-of-interest problems somehow degenerated into a squabble over the 
integrity of council members who were not in any way involved with the mayor's 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
When the smoke cleared, the proposed ethics reform package had been butchered, 
with the heart of the package -- campaign finance reform -- torn out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Today the council will have the opportunity to reverse its direction. I intend 
to ask my colleagues to bite the bullet and give voters a chance to enact a 
political reform package combining strict limits on campaign spending and 
limited public financing as an alternative to raising campaign money from 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Money is the root of the problem. Politicians can't live without money because 
the cost of reaching out to the voters in a contested campaign is outrageously 
high -- and continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it's becoming increasingly clear that politicians can't live 
with the need for money, either, as evidenced by the current scandals in 
Washington, Sacramento and City Hall. In order to reduce the lure of 
corruption, we have to reduce the need for money. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has ruled that it is a violation of the First Amendment to 
arbitrarily limit campaign spending. Instead, we must create an incentive for 
candidates to do so voluntarily. The only incentive the Supreme Court accepts 
is matching public funds. 
</P>
<P>
In the ordinance I am proposing, a candidate can only receive matching funds 
for contributions of $250 or less that he or she receives from individuals -- 
not corporations. Further, in order to qualify, a candidate must agree to a 
schedule of legitimate public debates with his or her challengers. 
</P>
<P>
That means candidates would be free to appeal directly to the voters they hope 
to govern -- not the people who hope to influence the political process with 
their contributions. It also means that the voter can be assured that a 
substantial amount of the money raised by a candidate is public money, 
untainted by private interests seeking to influence the decision-maker. 
</P>
<P>
But it does not mean that any lunatic off the street can use tax dollars to 
finance a campaign. To qualify for funds, a council candidate must first raise 
$25,000 -- and a citywide candidate must raise $100,000 -- in individual 
contributions. If a Nazi or Klan member can do that in Los Angeles, we have 
bigger problems than ethics reform can solve. 
</P>
<P>
As for the argument that public financing is too costly, I can only ask how 
much the recent ethics scandals have cost this city. That cost should be 
calculated not only in dollars but in the confidence of the people in their 
elected officials. And how much has it cost us to elect politicians who serve 
private interests before the public good? 
</P>
<P>
In order to further limit the cost to the public, my proposed ordinance caps 
matching funds at $2 million a year. Given a total city budget of $3.2 billion 
a year, this amount is less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, campaign finance reform is a relatively inexpensive way to make 
public office attainable for serious candidates who don't have the backing of 
moneyed interests seeking to influence government for their own gain. It 
increases the likelihood that the voters would be able to choose candidates who 
are not indebted to private interests. 
</P>
<P>
The experience in Seattle is a good example. When public financing became 
available, more women ran for office, more minorities ran for office. In fact, 
there were more candidates, period. And they spent less per race. As a result, 
people in Seattle had real choices in the voting booth, and they were confident 
the candidates represented them and not some unnamed bankroller. 
</P>
<P>
People in Los Angeles deserve the same confidence. They deserve the most 
ethical government they can elect. 
</P>
<P>
The council's last pass at the ethics reform package was a hatchet job, but 
today we have the opportunity to redeem ourselves and take the high road to 
campaign finance reform.

BASEBALL LOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the baseball owners attempt to close down our national pastime with their 
lockout, the big losers will be baseball fans like me. 
</P>
<P>
It would appear that since the players will be unilaterally denied their 
ability to work, their contracts could be declared invalid, making them free 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the players, the stadiums and their cities, their 
concessionaires and workers would be shutouts too. 
</P>
<P>
All that is needed is a few entrepreneurs like Donald Trump to ride to the 
rescue. They could put together a new baseball league, signing up the available 
players. The stadiums, cities, workers, and especially the fans, would be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
Only the curmudgeonly owners would be locked out. The American pastime would be 
saved by the free enterprise system.

"A likely story, Misha. Our records show that on May 1, 1985, you marched in a 
May Day parade with the Lenin Daughters of the Revolution. Do you deny this?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was an accident. I was looking for the GUM department store and I wound up 
at the head of the march. It was a terrible thing to do, but how was I supposed 
to know that all the people in the parade were not fellow travelers?" 
</P>
<P>
"You should have known. Moscow was full of Communists at that time." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Chairman, it was my wife who made me go to Communist Party meetings. She 
told me that if I did, we would get a larger apartment and be allowed to shop 
at the Party store." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you denouncing your wife for being a Communist?" 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to very much. Her first name is Lara." 
</P>
<P>
"Misha Obolensky, you don't get off just because you denounced your wife. We 
want names of other people in your cell. You owe it to us to provide a list of 
Reds." 
</P>
<P>
"You will have to torture me before I reveal the names of the traitors I 
associated with." 
</P>
<P>
"Misha, we can hold you for contempt of the Presidium." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't you say so? Here is a list in alphabetical order. All of them said 
nice things about Joseph Stalin at one time or another." 
</P>
<P>
"This committee is trying to ferret out every Marxist-Leninist in the Soviet 
Union. We cannot do it until mealy-mouthed pinkos like you tell us what took 
place at your meetings." 
</P>
<P>
"What happened at a Communist Party meeting? We laughed, we sang, we partied 
and we played Spin the Proletariat." 
</P>
<P>
"You made no speeches about the world order of socialism and burying the West?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was just cocktail conversation. You know how Reds are when they get 
together and have nothing to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
"Would you care to give us details of what else your cell discussed?" 
</P>
<P>
"What cell? It was a club -- we went to soccer games and Lenin's Tomb. Believe 
me, Mr. Chairman, we had nothing to do with the revolution whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't, who did?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Trotskyites. They're the ones who imposed a one-party system on the 
Motherland. My members were for the Democratic Party. I swear it on my wife's 
head -- would you like her address?" 
</P>
<P>
"Misha, did you ever put microfilm in a pumpkin in your garden?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think I may have once. They were naked photographs of Comrade Brezhnev, whom 
we all hated and feared. Having pictures of him doesn't make me a Communist." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make you a Lithuanian, either."

YOUR BODY: PARENTS MAY NOT KNOW WHEN CAR SAFETY SEATS ARE RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents often breathe a sigh of relief once they buckle their toddlers into 
automobile safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
That might be a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1968, there have been 39 recalls of various models of child safety seats 
by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the federal 
agency that oversees the devices. Some seats failed to meet federal safety 
standards, while others had defects such as harness failure, shell cracks or 
buckle problems. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, consumers aren't likely to find out about recalls of 
defective seats or other equipment problems, the Center for Auto Safety, a 
Washington-based nonprofit consumer organization, charged during congressional 
hearings last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably only 6% of owners of defective safety seats learn of the recalls," 
says Russell Shew, a spokesman for the center. "That compares with about 40-50% 
for automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
Counters Kent Milton of the federal agency: "The rate is about 14%, but that's 
still lower than we'd like." 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters, some retailers aren't aware of recalls and continue to 
sell defective safety seats, says Laura Polacheck, a spokeswoman for the 
center. In a 1989 telephone survey conducted by the center, only one of 19 
retailers knew about a recently recalled child safety seat. 
</P>
<P>
"We called the 800 number of a manufacturer whose infant seat had (just) been 
recalled," Polacheck says, "and the operator (who answered) said, 'No problem.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, the Center for Auto Safety suggests setting up a national 
registry of consumers who purchase child safety seats. 
</P>
<P>
The NHTSA is looking into the idea, Milton says. 
</P>
<P>
Until the center's idea -- or a similar one -- becomes reality, a buyer-beware 
approach seems best. Consumers can take steps to help guarantee the seat they 
choose is safe. 
</P>
<P>
* Before you shop, obtain the new edition of "Shopping Guide to Car Seats," 
just revised by the American Academy of Pediatrics. (To obtain the guide, send 
a business-size self-addressed, stamped envelope to the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, P.O. Box 927, Elk Grove Village, Ill. 60009-0927.) Among the 
Academy's tips: Install seats for infants (birth to 20 pounds) facing backward. 
Pad a newborn's seat with diapers to prevent slouching. Try the seat in the car 
before buying it. Don't be taken in by glitz. "Low-priced and high-priced 
models generally provide equal crash protection," the academy says. 
</P>
<P>
* When you find the child safety seat you want, don't buy it right away, 
suggests Shew of the Center for Auto Safety. First copy the manufacturer's 
name, model number, and toll-free telephone number. Telephone the manufacturer 
and ask whether there has been a recall or any equipment problem with that car 
seat model. For extra insurance, write the Center for Auto Safety, 2001 S 
Street N.W., Suite 410, Washington, D.C. 20009. Include a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope and ask for a list of recently recalled car seats. Or call the 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's toll-free auto safety hot 
line, (800) 424-9393, for recall information. 
</P>
<P>
* Once you've purchased a seat, write to the manufacturer, Shew suggests. "In 
the letter, note the make and model of the seat, the date purchased and the 
manufacturer. Ask that the company register that information in their files. 
Ask to be notified in case of a recall." 
</P>
<P>
The problems with child safety seats shouldn't dissuade parents from using 
them, experts emphasize. 
</P>
<P>
"Even defective car seats are better than no seats at all," Shew says. 
</P>
<P>

Matter of Marital Fidelity 
</P>
<P>
Cheating is not unusual in marriages, according to surveys by marriage 
counselors and such controversial cultural historians as Shere Hite. Up to 70% 
of U.S. married couples have been involved in affairs, their polls find. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious question: Can you keep a long-term relationship monogamous simply 
by building your partner's ego and paying special attention to his or her 
needs? Here are two views. 
</P>
<P>
* YES: Alexandra Penney, New York, author of "How to Keep Your Man Monogamous" 
(Bantam, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
"For most people it's possible. There are certain men and women who will never 
be monogamous. They have ego needs that can't be met or nurtured by another 
person. But for most couples, paying attention to the partner's needs is the 
first step toward maintaining monogamy. 
</P>
<P>
"What are those needs? Men's main ego needs are based on achievement, 
acceptance, accomplishment, power and sexuality. Women's main ego needs are to 
love and be loved." 
</P>
<P>
* NO: Peggy Vaughan, La Jolla, author of "The Monogamy Myth" (Newmarket Press, 
1989). 
</P>
<P>
"Most people think they have the power to prevent their partner's affairs. They 
think, 'If my partner loves me and feels good around me, he won't be attracted 
to someone else.' Not true. 
</P>
<P>
"Your partner will be attracted to other people, regardless of how happy he or 
she is with you. Couples need to stop fearing the attraction. That is normal. 
Couples need to talk about the realistic prevalence of affairs. This kind of 
frank discussion diminishes the fascination with the secrecy surrounding most 
affairs.

It's Not Chicken Soup, but It's Hot 
</P>
<P>
So you didn't get a flu shot this year and now you feel achy. There is a new 
treat-yourself option called TheraFlu, promoted as the first over-the-counter 
hot liquid medicine for flu. 
</P>
<P>
Users dissolve a lemon-flavored powder into hot water and drink it as often as 
every four hours. One formula has a decongestant, antihistamine and analgesic; 
another formula includes those medicines plus a cough suppressant. 
</P>
<P>
TheraFlu may sound as miraculous as chicken soup, but consumers should still 
check with a pharmacist first, advises Teresa Miller, spokeswoman for the 
California Pharmacists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"You may not need all those medicines," she says. "A pharmacist can assess 
which medicines will be most helpful based on your symptoms. You may be better 
off taking separate products and fewer products. You might need a decongestant, 
for instance, but not an antihistamine."

ERMA BOMBECK : FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT AGAINST OBSOLESCENCE

My son said, "Guess what, Mom? I'm going to buy a CD." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't know the kid knew what a certificate of deposit was. My heart raced. 
"Do you realize that is the first mature decision you've made in years?" 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that you are looking ahead tells us you're beginning to see the big 
picture." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is," I insisted. "It means you're finally investing in something that 
will give you something back." 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," he said. "I have to buy all new records and that'll keep me in 
hock until I'm 40." 
</P>
<P>
"What are you talking about?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"CD -- compact disc. You know, a state-of-the-art stereo." 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter with the old one?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obsolete," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's an old story. All of his life he has fought obsolescence . . . and lost. 
The camera he bought was dated before he reached his car. He purchased one that 
was totally automatic, from the built-in focus to the light meter. Fifteen 
minutes later, they came out with a throwaway camera. 
</P>
<P>
When he bought his last pair of skis, I remember telling him to postdate the 
check two weeks to stave off what I knew was about to happen. He didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the stereos that have kept him at poverty level since his first 
part-time job. First, it was just a plain little turntable. Then he needed 
speakers that required holes in the walls the size of fists. After that it was 
needles that cost more than my wedding ring. 
</P>
<P>
Every time he traded up, it was because the sound had been improved. It wasn't 
like he was listening to the London Symphony. Besides, by the time the sound 
had been refined, he had lost 50% of his hearing anyway. 
</P>
<P>
I know in my heart that the compact disc is on its way out -- just like every 
radio he bought that was followed by a smaller and a cheaper one. 
</P>
<P>
Every watch he ever had became an antique in a matter of months. The one he 
wears now does everything but shave him. His phone is 2 years old. It's out of 
date. 
</P>
<P>
My husband tells me to butt out. None of it is any of my business. Kids have to 
learn lessons themselves. It has nothing to do with us. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't figured it out yet. His son is one paycheck away from moving home.

THE STORY OF BRAIN OPIATES -- FOR SCIENTISTS ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brainstorming: The Science and Politics of Opiate Research by Solomon H. Snyder 
(Harvard University Press: $22.95; 200 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Science writers frequently debate whether it is better to be a writer who 
learns science or a scientist who learns to write. 
</P>
<P>
In general -- and with notable exceptions -- specialists in all fields tend to 
write for other specialists, losing sight of the general reader. This is 
particularly true of scientists. They tend to write too narrowly, focusing on 
the trees rather than the forest. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon H. Snyder is a distinguished neuropharmacologist at Johns Hopkins 
University. In the early 1970s, he and his graduate student Candace Pert 
discovered opiate receptors in the brain -- the places where opiates attach to 
nerve cells. 
</P>
<P>
This was a major step in understanding the physical mechanism for overcoming 
pain and feeling good. 
</P>
<P>
This discovery was one of the most important findings in brain research in 
recent decades. It paved the way for the discovery of endorphins -- the body's 
own morphine. For a while it was thought that this research would result in the 
synthesis of nonaddictive painkillers (which has not occurred). 
</P>
<P>
"Brainstorming" is Snyder's story of the research, which was carried on by 
teams of researchers in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But despite its subtitle, "The Science and Politics of Opiate Research," and 
despite occasional insights into the human world of science, Snyder's book 
delivers less than it promises. He has fallen into the trap of writing for 
other scientists. 
</P>
<P>
The work on opiate receptors and endorphins makes a compelling story, full of 
hard science and lots of human foibles. As it happens, the story has been told 
from different points of view in two other books published in recent years -- 
"Apprentice to Genius" by Robert Kanigel (reviewed in this space on Dec. 23, 
1986) and "Anatomy of a Scientific Discovery" by Jeff Goldberg (reviewed on May 
20, 1988). Both were written by science writers, and both are better books than 
Snyder's. 
</P>
<P>
Kanigel and Goldberg capture the excitement of scientific research in a way 
that Snyder doesn't. His writing is serviceable but flat, as if he is still 
writing for a scientific journal. ("Low concentrations of sodium markedly 
weakened the ability of MLF to compete for naloxone binding to opiate 
receptors.") 
</P>
<P>
Compare Goldberg's description of the reaction of John Hughes, a researcher in 
Aberdeen, Scotland, when he and Hans Kosterlitz discovered the natural 
endorphins that bind to the opiate receptors: "Hughes was positively jubilant, 
. . . jumping up from the table at one point, and doing a little jig around the 
living room, singing in his monotone at the top of his lungs, 'We're going to 
be famous! We're going to be famous!' " 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's best passages are the personal ones, where he reveals something about 
himself or how he thinks. ("I had little interest in caring for people's 
diseased bodies when I became a medical student," he writes at one point. "The 
M.D. degree, for me, was just a means to an end: becoming a psychiatrist. What 
I really wanted to study was disease of the mind.") 
</P>
<P>
But there aren't enough such passages, and they seem appended to the narrative 
rather than integrated with it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Snyder's book omits important parts of the story. Pert was his 
graduate student and co-researcher in the original 1973 paper announcing the 
discovery of the opiate receptor. In fact, her name was listed on that paper 
before his. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1978, when a Lasker Award -- the American Nobel Prize -- was given for 
the work, Pert did not share in it. It went to Snyder alone for the discovery 
of the opiate receptor and to Kosterlitz and Hughes in Scotland for the 
discovery of endorphins. 
</P>
<P>
The exclusion of Pert touched off a very nasty and very public fight, leading 
to a severing of ties between her and Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
Though she was a graduate student, she claimed that she had done more of the 
work than Snyder had and that she stood in the same relation to him that 
graduate student Hughes occupied in relation to Kosterlitz. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kanigel and Goldberg recount this dispute is detail. Amazingly, Snyder 
doesn't mention it at all, though Pert is very much in the book and he has a 
few less-than-complimentary things to say about her. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether Snyder is simply trying to remain above the battle or 
whether he regrets that Pert didn't share the Lasker. Whatever the explanation, 
it is a glaring omission, and it makes you wonder what else he has left out. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's book is not without value. It is full of the details of important 
research told by a key researcher. His speculations at the end about the 
physical bases of psychiatric disorders point to valuable future work. But if 
you only wanted to read one book on the subject, read one of the others.

New Call Letters for KJOI: KJOI-FM (98.7) changed its call letters early Monday 
to KXEZ, about four months after making a change in format from "beautiful 
music" to easy listening soft hits. .. . Also at KXEZ, Rich Capparela, a former 
KFAC-FM announcer who made a much-publicized move to KJOI just after the format 
change last October, was fired last Friday. He has been replaced by Steve Day 
in the 5-9 a.m. shift. BETH KLEID

HERBERT BLOMSTEDT LEADS SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco Symphony is a distinctive band with a clear sonic identity, 
at least in the bright acoustic of Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. That's good news in this age of sound-alike orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
As heard on disc and at home in Davies Hall, the features of the San Francisco 
sound are tight, lean strings and wonderfully fluent, characterful woodwinds. 
To this mix, Segerstrom Hall added overwhelming brass, giving the orchestra at 
climactic moments a very thick middle with virtually no top. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the program heard Sunday afternoon, devoted to Dvorak, had 
many such moments. Music director Herbert Blomstedt took the currently popular 
Seventh Symphony with a full measure of Mahlerian hyperbole, stressing dramatic 
development and formal contrasts. This line unraveled a bit in the Finale, but 
otherwise proved a cogent argument, its sound and fury signifying much in the 
way of deeply felt tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Blomstedt's musicians gave him a responsive, well-integrated performance, 
always excepting the tendency for the brass-led winds to cover everything in an 
heroic blaze. The oboes and clarinets in particular covered themselves with 
solo glory, in a propulsive performance of great definition and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Polite applause proved an oxymoron as the large crowd clapped for nearly every 
movement throughout the afternoon, whether it be the exhausted despair of 
Dvorak's first movement or the end of a Haydn Minuet, with Blomstedt poised to 
continue. Only at the end of the Dvorak Scherzo did he evade the clapping, 
launching the Finale almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Blomstedt rewarded the audience with two encores, Dvorak's 
Slavonic Dances No. 3 and No. 8. These were true to their kinetic roots, 
vigorously accented and dizzying in contrast. 
</P>
<P>
On the first half, Blomstedt paired Haydn's Symphony No. 86 with David 
Carlson's Rhapsodies. The latter is a lush sequence of instrumental songs, 
currently making the rounds of orchestras great and small, far and near. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscent of Stravinsky's "Firebird" in the shimmering scoring and David Del 
Tredici's "Alice" music in its yearning sentiment, Rhapsodies is a gushingly 
accessible orchestral vehicle. Graced with eloquent, pointed woodwind solos and 
a warm string context, the performance rose frequently to expansive climaxes, 
glib emotional swellings rather than substantive developments. 
</P>
<P>
Blomstedt began the concert with about half the orchestra, though the effect in 
the marvelously quirky Haydn was more ritualistic than stylistic. His tempos 
were brisk and the playing crisp -- including some odd, terse ornaments -- 
though again there was a clotted sound with secondary wind parts blurring the 
essential string lines. 
</P>
<P>
The program was scheduled to be repeated Monday at the Music Center, with a 
second program slated there for tonight. Wednesday, the touring San Franciscans 
appear at McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert.JOHN HENKEN

LYRIC QUARTET AT PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For three of the members of the Lyric Piano Quartet, Sunday's concert in 
Pepperdine University's Smothers Theatre was a kind of homecoming, since each 
had at some point called Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
And what a homecoming it was. The quartet offered not only stunning accuracy 
and faultless precision of ensemble, but also spellbinding intensity, 
incandescent passion and soaring lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The heavily Romantic agenda afforded many opportunities for these qualities. 
Faure's G-minor Quartet, full of sudden changes of mood, proved an effective 
vehicle for the New-York based ensemble to convey an usually wide expressive 
range. It also showcased the warmth and sensitivity with which violinist Glenn 
Dicterow, violist Karen Dreyfus, cellist James Kreger and pianist Gerald 
Robbins perform. 
</P>
<P>
Dicterow, local listeners will recall, served as the Philharmonic's associate 
concertmaster (later the word associate was dropped) under Zubin Mehta and in 
1980 joined the New York Philharmonic as concertmaster. 
</P>
<P>
The cellist and pianist, too, spent part of their early careers in Los Angeles, 
especially Robbins, a Los Angeles native who made regular Southland appearances 
for two decades. Along with violist Dreyfus, the four make an unusually 
synergetic, interpretively unified ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
That was as evident in Dvorak's Quartet in E-flat, Opus 87, as it was in Faure. 
Exhibiting apt instincts for drama and a fine grasp of musical architecture, 
the ensemble brought to the work an ideal combination of vitality and 
restraint, intelligently pacing the work so as to maximize its emotional 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
The group also offered an energized reading of Mahler's tempestuous 
"Quartettsatz," an early work that could well have been deleted from this 
generous program. 
</P>
<P>
The New Yorkers opened the proceedings by delivering an utterly persuasive 
argument for Beethoven's Quartet in D. Without sacrificing one whit of polish 
or refinement, they brought probing insight, dynamic vigor, and stirring 
heroism to the 1785 work. TERRY McQUILKIN

AVAZ AND DJIMBE SHARE SECOND 'IN THE WORKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With two minutes of explanatory chit-chat for every minute of dancing, the Jan. 
21 opening program of the Dance Gallery's "In the Works" series expressed a 
clear preference for blather over art. On Sunday at the Gascon Institute in the 
old Helms Bakery Building in Culver City, Program Two lasted even longer: more 
than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time to rename this six-part event "In the Words" and recognize that 
it has no purpose beyond proving that choreographers can sound as inane as 
anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
How many times do we have to hear that Leon Mobley (artistic director of 
Djimbe) comes from Boston? It's not a hard concept to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Why subject Anthony Shay (artistic director of Avaz) to countless audience 
questions that ultimately provide curiosity gratification rather than any 
deepened perspective on a performance? "In the Works" seems to bring out the 
worst in everyone. 
</P>
<P>
A company with a background of community and school performances -- as well as 
an annual summer residency at the L.A. Zoo -- Djimbe specializes in traditional 
West African music and dance. The drumming (led by Mobley) is often brilliant 
but the dancing by a spirited, well-drilled five-woman, one-man group doesn't 
measure up. 
</P>
<P>
In "Sunu," "Lamba" and "Dounba" sequences, the stretch, drive and articulation 
of the dancing remain curtailed -- sharp enough, admittedly, to be 
invigorating, but never near any flashpoint. Oddly, a sense of group unity 
emerges only when the members sing; in dance, their differences loom larger 
than any shared identity. 
</P>
<P>
By now, Avaz is well known to local audiences, and Shay's meticulous 
introductions are a familiar part of company programs. New, however, is his 
capsule history of theatricalized folk dance: factually unreliable (no mention 
of the Denishawn company, for starters) and self-aggrandizing. 
</P>
<P>
A generous sampling of dances from Baluchistan, Romania, Tajikistan, Croatia, 
Armenia and Kurdistan suggest the richness and variety of an Avaz evening, with 
the company men looking particularly fine in the rapid, intricate steps of a 
Romanian "Calusari" ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions of Avaz women range from the grave, skimming steps of the 
Armenian "In Anush Davig" trio to a quintet from Baluchistan in which they 
shake and strike their bracelets, as well as flicking their fingers left and 
right in bold gestural filigree. 
</P>
<P>
All the talk and, especially, the dancers' costumes gain from the intimacy of 
the temporary Dance Gallery studio space -- though sight line problems keep the 
footwork lost to much of the audience. Anybody want to donate some risers 
before Gregg Bielemeier and Stephanie Gilliland's program of solos on March 18?

A RICH RENDITION OF WELLES' VERSION OF FAUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orson Welles' business was theatrical magic. His avocation was real magic. In 
1937, he had a rare occasion for combining the two, in his own adaptation of 
Christopher Marlowe's "The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus." He made people 
appear and vanish (his famous "Nuremberg lights" did the trick) among other 
sleights of hand. And he transformed Marlowe's heavy Elizabethan melodrama into 
a shape and size compatible with the contemporary ear and sensibility. If one 
must hack away at the classics this looks very much like the way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three years later, USC inaugurates its Contemporary Artists in the 
Theatre series with the Welles adaptation, and it sounds just fine. It hasn't 
aged a bit. Welles was a bit more contemporary than he realized. 
</P>
<P>
The curtain rises on an impressive image created by the scenic design of very 
modern painter/ sculptor Richard Artschwager. Bathed in a slight mist, a 
hangar-shaped archway curves widely above a sort of table, carved to resemble 
an ancient book lying open to divulge its mystical secrets. From the sides of 
the archway a wire-mesh stairway ascends backward and upward to a seeming 
infinity, a sort of highway of human incident, focusing momentarily, beneath 
the arch, on Doctor Faustus' study. 
</P>
<P>
Under the flashy, intricate lighting designed by Nick Pagliante the steps 
become many things, among them cages that sometimes confine the hounds of hell, 
writhing as they watch the action unfold. The concept Artschwager has brought 
to the production would have pleased Welles. 
</P>
<P>
There is further magic afoot. Noted magician Harry Blackstone has conceived and 
supervised some interesting illusions, but nothing as startling as the set on 
which they take place (and couldn't the wires atop Faustus' shuttle to Hell 
have been better hidden?). 
</P>
<P>
The company of USC Drama Department students handles the text well under the 
imaginative direction of Steven Kent and Richard Toscan. They have humor (one 
friar who sings off-key and rings the world's worst sounding bell is right out 
of Monty Python) and some knowledge of the desperation of human endeavor. Scott 
Atkinson makes the strongest impression as Wagner, the narrator, who takes 
other shapes as well; he's also very funny playing second banana to Todd R. 
Hansen's witty, athletic Robin. Timothy Omundson hasn't found much power to 
fuel his Faustus. He knows his way around the dialogue but not how to get 
inside it to set it aflame. 
</P>
<P>
Why isn't the Welles adaptation revived more frequently? Probably because its 
effects are as much in the realm of its designers as its performers. With a 
powerful original score by Michele Brourman (fine sound design by John D. 
Palmer) and the incisive costumes by Ritchie Spencer, this is a production of 
high technical quality, one that cares about Welles' rich reworking of the 
legend and embraces its spirit and heart. 
</P>
<P>
At Bing Theatre, USC Campus; plays Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 
2 p.m.; ends February 18. Tickets: $4; (213) 743-7111.

Bye Bye 45s?The Tower Records chain issued an in-house memo telling its store 
managers and buyers to "not purchase any seven-inch vinyl new release or hit 
singles from any vendor."

Tower was one of the last champions of the vinyl 45, and has prided itself on 
continuing to make vinyl records available to its customers despite drooping 
sales. The chain was one of the last that stocked a wide selection of the 
singles. Tower will continue to purchase oldies singles, however. BETH KLEID

About 200 people watched as veterans and state leaders laid 20 wreaths Monday 
at Abraham Lincoln's tomb in an annual pilgrimage to mark the 181st anniversary 
of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) presented a wreath 
from President Bush made of red, white and blue carnations. Both compared 
Lincoln's desire for freedom to the democratic movements in Eastern Europe and 
the release from prison of black activist Nelson R. Mandela in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln owned his only home in Springfield and lived in that downtown residence 
from 1844-60 while he practiced law and served in the Illinois General 
Assembly.

UNION INVESTIGATION CLEARS PILOTS IN SKID, CRASH OF USAIR JETLINER

<P>
The Air Line Pilots Assn. on Monday blamed mechanical problems for the crash of 
a USAir jet that skidded off a La Guardia Airport runway last fall, killing two 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued a day before the National Transportation Safety Board is 
scheduled to begin hearings into the Sept. 20, 1989, crash, the union 
exonerated the plane's cockpit crew, whose performance had been the subject of 
intense scrutiny in the days after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think the crew did anything wrong," said Don Skiados, an ALPA 
spokesman. "We think that any other crew in the same situation would have acted 
in the same way and done exactly what they did." 
</P>
<P>
Flight 5050, a Boeing 737-400 bound for Charlotte, N.C., and carrying 63 
passengers and crew, slid off a rain-slicked runway and into the East River. 
Two passengers died and 45 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Officials speculated that human error might have caused the accident, and the 
flying licenses of the pilot and the co-pilot were suspended pending the 
results of the NTSB investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The union has paid for legal counsel for the pilot, Michael Martin, and the 
co-pilot, Constantine Kleissas, who were expected to testify this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman, said he had yet not seen the ALPA report. 
</P>
<P>
The ALPA investigation found that a mechanical malfunction or design flaw in 
the cockpit instrument that moves the 737-400's rudder caused a "critical 
problem" that forced the jet to veer dangerously to the left as it was speeding 
down the runway, said Donald McClure, an ALPA official. 
</P>
<P>
McClure said Boeing has acknowledged the problem in the instrument and sent a 
bulletin to air carriers last month.

RADAR CREW LOST TRACK OF EXXON VALDEZ 
</P>

<P>
Two Coast Guard radar watchers testified Monday that they did not notify the 
skipper of the Exxon Valdez when the vessel sailed off their screens and did 
not try to track its progress by radio until after the tanker grounded on Bligh 
Reef. 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon Valdez was the only ship under surveillance by the Coast Guard vessel 
traffic center for hours before the March 24 wreck, but that failed to 
guarantee that radar watchers monitored its progress out of treacherous Prince 
William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard radar watchman who started work 25 minutes before the grounding 
and 45 minutes before the Exxon Valdez radioed that it was aground said he 
never even tried to locate the off-course vessel because the earlier watchman, 
Gordon Taylor, said it had disappeared from radar. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Blandford testified in Alaska Superior Court that, at the first radioed 
report of the wreck, he tried for the first time to find the Exxon Valdez on 
radar and the grounded tanker showed up perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers capitalized on the testimony to demonstrate that perhaps it was 
Coast Guard negligence, not the captain's alleged drunken recklessness, that 
contributed to the grounding. Lawyers for the Coast Guard and the Justice 
Department listened intently. 
</P>
<P>
The skipper, Joseph Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., faces up to seven years 
and three months in jail and a $61,000 fine if convicted on charges of 
operating the Exxon Valdez while intoxicated, reckless endangerment, negligent 
discharge of oil and criminal mischief. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Blandford nor Taylor notified the skipper when his ship disappeared 
from their radar screens as it sailed on a collision course with Bligh Reef, 
where it broke open and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
Prince William Sound last March 24. 
</P>
<P>
The two men revealed that another loaded tanker, the Arco Juneau, had taken a 
similar detour around ice four hours earlier without any problems, and thus 
they thought nothing of the Exxon Valdez leaving its prescribed tanker lane. 
Blandford said such a detour was considered routine. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Blandford said the radar was less than reliable, affected by 
snowstorms and sometimes went on the blink, working off and on near Bligh Reef, 
25 miles out. 
</P>
<P>
Blandford said the radar seemed to be deteriorating. Taylor indicated that in 
the weeks before the wreck, radar "targets were getting harder to hold onto." 
</P>
<P>
Blandford said the 987-foot Exxon tanker may have shown up on radar after the 
grounding because by then the radar had a broadside view of the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after assuming the watch, Blandford said, he left the controls for 5 
minutes to get coffee and check the weather.

Representatives of Hartson Medical Services and the union representing its 
paramedics are expected to meet with city officials today to ask for more money 
so the company can settle a tentative agreement on a labor contract reached at 
7 a.m. Monday after an all-night bargaining session. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement averts a strike scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Wednesday by the Service 
Employees International Union, Local 102. The union represents about 160 
paramedics employed by the city of San Diego and has been bargaining with 
Hartson since April. If approved, the contract will be the first achieved 
through collective bargaining for paramedics in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Any agreement will have to be reviewed by the city manager's office. On Monday, 
a source familiar with the contract talks who did not want to be identified 
said both sides will try to meet with Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton and 
other city officials today, brief them on the agreement, and make a pitch for 
the extra funds. 
</P>
<P>
The source said that Hartson and Local 102 have not agreed on the size of the 
pay increase for paramedics, but added that "the differences are not 
insurmountable at this point" and predicted that both sides will probably agree 
today. Spokeswomen for Hartson and Local 102 said that both sides will issue a 
joint statement today on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of progress made. Essentially, both sides reached agreement on 
a new contract, but it's not formal yet. There's still a very important issue 
that has to be discussed with the city," said the source. 
</P>
<P>
That issue is how to get the money needed to meet the paramedics' demand for a 
pay increase, he added. Both sides hope that the city will agree to modify its 
contract with Hartson and give the company more money to meet the paramedics' 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Local 102 president Eliseo Medina and Hartson Chief Executive 
Officer Glen Roberts said the company would probably have to seek a subsidy 
from the City Council to raise employee salaries. Hartson has a $6.8-million 
paramedic contract with San Diego that expires in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Hartson paramedics earn $6.50 to $9.55 an hour, and emergency medical 
technicians start at $5 an hour. The union said that Hartson paramedics are the 
lowest-paid in the county, earning an average 24% less than others. Union 
officials declined to comment on their wage demands, except to say that their 
bargaining team was asking $8 an hour as a starting wage for paramedics.

CONSTELLATION AWEIGH; 1ST OF 2 CARRIERS LEAVES 
</P>

The aircraft carrier Constellation pulled out of San Diego Monday morning, 
departing for a 29-month overhaul and leaving questions in its wake about the 
carrier presence at one of the Navy's major bases. 
</P>
<P>
For the city, the Constellation's departure means an annual loss of more than 
$45 million in sailors' payroll, supplies and services. But the exact price tag 
of the carrier's departure is unknown because Navy officials do not calculate 
how much will be lost when the spouses and families of the 2,500 crew members 
also depart. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, we are not going to feel it," said Pete Litrenta, vice 
president of military affairs with the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. 
"Initially, it will seem like the ship is going out on a deployment." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego area is host to 145,000 Navy personnel and benefits from about 
$9.5 billion in annual military expenditures, so the loss of one aircraft 
carrier is not significant, Litrenta said. After the Constellation's 
$750-million refurbishment at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, the 85,000-ton 
carrier is scheduled to return to San Diego in early 1993, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob 
Pritchard, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Constellation's refurbishment will include improving the engineering plant, 
combat systems, and living quarters. As part of the Navy's Service Life 
Extension program, workers will also overhaul the aircraft launching and 
arresting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Constellation's departure leaves San Diego with two aircraft carriers, the 
Independence and the Ranger. But the situation could easily change. The 
Independence is slated for a June, 1991, deployment to Japan, where it will 
replace the aging carrier Midway, high-ranking Navy officers said. The Midway 
was commissioned in 1945 and is one of the Navy's oldest carriers. Some say it 
has outlived its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
With the Constellation absent for repairs and the Independence in Japan, San 
Diego would be left with one carrier. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to start crying that the sky is falling until I know what the 
Navy's plans are," Litrenta said. "But a million here, a million there -- it 
starts adding up to some real money." 
</P>
<P>
For San Diego and other Navy hosts, there is considerable uncertainty as 
President Bush hammers out a new military budget that calls for the closing of 
bases and the mothballing of ships. Under the latest proposal, two carriers in 
Northern California -- the Carl Vinson and the Enterprise -- would need a home 
port. San Diego, some say, would be a logical choice. 
</P>
<P>
And, while lawmakers haggle over a variety of other military expenses, none yet 
have questioned the aircraft carriers. But Navy officers are quick to jump to 
their defense. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be able to influence events in the world, then there is no 
better platform than an aircraft carrier." said Capt. Tom Slater, commanding 
officer of the Independence. 
</P>
<P>
Navy pilots who fly and land aboard the 1,079-foot-long Constellation will 
remain unaffected by the carrier's new assignment. The aircraft squadrons once 
assigned to the Constellation are now assigned to the Independence, Pritchard 
said.

Mayor Tom Bradley, Councilman Nate Holden, actor Brock Peters and other 
community and religious leaders led a candlelight vigil Monday on the steps of 
Los Angeles City Hall to call for an end to racism. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a nationwide drive called "The Call for Racial Harmony, Justice and 
Equality," the officials also signed a petition and pledged support to help 
stem prejudice and racial and religious violence. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Charles Stith, of the Boston-based Organization for a New Equality,

GALLEGLY TO JOIN ELECTION WATCH IN NICARAGUA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a fervent critic of Nicaragua's Sandinista 
government, has joined an international delegation that will observe the 
embattled country's Feb. 25 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will be one of 12 
members of Congress in a group that is going to Nicaragua under the auspices of 
the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. Former President Jimmy 
Carter heads the delegation chosen by the council, which is composed of former 
heads of state, mostly from Western democracies. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Sandinistas' past history, I am hopeful that with the attention of 
the world focused on them, they will carry out their promises and let the 
people of Nicaragua decide how they should be governed," Gallegly said in 
announcing his role with the observer group. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly is one of several lawmakers recently added to the 30-member 
delegation, which was initially selected months ago. The group's expansion 
follows the Sandinistas' decision to deny visas to an official 20-member 
congressional observer team appointed by President Bush because the 
Administration contributed funds to the Nicaraguan opposition alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), who was appointed co-chairman of the 
official congressional group, said Monday, "The White House was apparently 
unable to get the Sandinistas to let us in so we've disbanded." 
</P>
<P>
The election is a potential watershed for war-weary Nicaragua. Conservatives, 
however, remain skeptical that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega will permit a 
free and fair vote, particularly if there is a chance that the Sandinistas face 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter mission is one of three observer groups that already have been 
keeping tabs on the campaign through representatives in Nicaragua. The other 
teams are sponsored by the Organization of American States and the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, a two-term lawmaker, has visited Nicaragua twice since his election 
in 1986. He will be in the Central American nation from Feb. 22 until Feb. 26, 
spokesman John Frith said.

VENTURA BOULEVARD GROWTH PLAN ANGERS BOTH SIDES; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: CITY PLANNERS CALL FOR STIFF BUILDERS' FEES ALONG THE VALLEY'S 
17-MILE 'MAIN STREET'. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A plan for regulating growth along Ventura Boulevard, released Monday by Los 
Angeles city planners, drew fire from developers and slow-growth advocates 
alike as it endorsed ceilings on growth and traffic identical to those proposed 
last August by a citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
Even with those lids, the amount of commercial space along the boulevard -- 
sometimes called the San Fernando Valley's Main Street -- would be allowed to 
increase by 44%. The flip side is that, under the plan, developers would be 
required to pay hefty fees to help relieve the traffic congestion created by 
their new projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to bring development to a quick halt," said Ben Reznik, a land-use 
attorney who represents several developers with large commercial projects along 
the 17-mile length of Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
But Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. Vice President Fred Kramer said the proposal 
by the city Planning Department would encourage office construction and 
eventually destroy the boulevard's remaining low-rise, neighborhood-serving 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It will force the consumer to drive three to five miles to get gas, to get 
groceries," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik and Kramer agreed that the plan would encourage office construction 
because offices generate fewer automobile trips for each 1,000 square feet of 
development than do retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
The development of a comprehensive plan for the boulevard has been three years 
in the making. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-member Citizens Advisory Committee, appointed by the six Los Angeles City 
Council members whose districts are crossed by the boulevard, issued its 
growth-control recommendations in August. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal unveiled by the Planning Department Monday leaves key features of 
those recommendations intact: 
</P>
<P>
* A limit of 8.6 million square feet of additional commercial growth. Currently 
Ventura Boulevard has about 19 million square feet of commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
* A limit of 30,000 additional automobile trips per day along the boulevard. 
Transportation analysts estimate that motorists currently make 70,000 trips 
along the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The size of individual new projects would be partly set by the amount of 
traffic they generate. Office projects, for example, generate far less traffic 
than retail projects and thus could be larger. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Sutton, a senior city planning official, emphasized Monday in a 
presentation to about 30 community leaders in Studio City that the 
recommendations of his department coincide with those of the citizens group on 
the two key growth limits. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton heatedly denied reports that his staff had delayed release of its 
proposal in order to give developers additional time to build their projects 
without the proposed limits. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it may be months before a final plan is adopted. The Planning 
Department's document goes next to the city's five-member Planning Commission 
for consideration. Finally, the commission will make a recommendation to the 
Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The commission is set to begin reviewing the department's proposal at a Feb. 22 
public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At least one city planner said the fact that the plan was being criticized by 
both sides in the development debate indicated that it was on target. "It seems 
to have hit the middle ground," said the planner, who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to Reznik, who represents developers, is the Planning 
Department's recommendation that the traffic mitigation fees paid by builders 
be set at anywhere from $3,838 to $7,629 per daily trip, depending on where 
along the boulevard the project is located. 
</P>
<P>
"These fees are prohibitively high," Reznik said. 
</P>
<P>
The fees are about twice as high as the citizens group recommended and would 
generate $170 million if the maximum amount of commercial space were built. 
Sutton said the increases would pay for street widening needs identified by the 
city's engineers since August. To accommodate the additional traffic, engineers 
now say streets must be widened for 370 feet on either side of major 
intersections. 
</P>
<P>
But Vivian Roscalvo, a deputy for Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents 
Sherman Oaks, voiced doubts about how much traffic improvement work would 
actually be done. Street widening can occur only if adjacent property owners 
are developing their land. If a property is not the site of a new development, 
the city cannot widen the streets in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
Roscalvo said the Planning Department proposal would permit six-story buildings 
in certain areas of Sherman Oaks where the citizens group had advised a 
three-story limit. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Miscikowski, chief deputy to Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents 
Encino, noted that the plan would permit four-story buildings in the heavily 
developed area between the San Diego Freeway and Balboa Boulevard. The advisory 
committee had recommended three-story limits there.

Reuben Sturman, described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest 
distributor of pornography, was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison and 
fined $2.46 million for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman, 65, who has a 5,610-square-foot Tudor-style house in Van Nuys and owns 
another residence in the Cleveland area, was convicted Nov. 17 in U.S. District 
Court of failing to report $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George White continued Sturman's $1-million cash bond, 
pending appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman also is awaiting trial in federal court in Las Vegas on charges of 
racketeering and interstate transportation of obscene material. If convicted on 
those charges, he could be sentenced to 75 years in prison and fined $22.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty in Cleveland could have been 70 years in prison, $2.5 
million in fines and $20 million in civil penalties. Prosecutors had asked that 
Sturman be sentenced to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this court stands a man who has driven a Rolls-Royce, spent $350,000 to 
remodel his home . . . and who finally reports an income of over $2 million a 
year," said Stephen H. Jigger, head of the Cleveland office of the Organized 
Crime Strike Force. "He has proven crime pays." 
</P>
<P>
Sturman's house on a quiet street in Van Nuys, an example of his wealth, sits 
on a football-field-sized lot surrounded by a five-foot-high fence and iron 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman's conviction last November set off a scramble among competitors eager 
to move in on the X-rated territory he dominated for two decades, according to 
industry and law enforcement sources. The 1986 report by the Attorney General's 
Commission on Pornography stated that by 1986, Sturman had control of 200 
businesses in 19 states and six foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
He started out distributing magazines and putting peep machines into adult 
bookstores around the country, but moved into the video business when it boomed 
in the early 1980s, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also concluded that Sturman had close ties to organized crime 
figures, especially Robert DiBernardo, identified in the report as a member of 
one, and possibly two, major crime families in New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
White sentenced Sturman to prison terms totaling 34 years, but several of the 
terms are to be served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman, who started his business 30 years ago in Cleveland, had been tried 
several times on pornography-related charges but never convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"He stands before you essentially as a first offender," Sturman's lawyer, 
Michael Murray, told the judge. "As a society, we do not impose life sentences 
or 30 years in prison for such offenses." 
</P>
<P>
The government's case said Sturman hid millions of dollars in foreign bank 
accounts. In June, prosecutors, defense lawyers and officials from federal 
court in Cleveland went to Switzerland to interview Swiss bankers. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony and evidence showed Sturman hid $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 
1982, failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. In 1979, for example, Sturman 
reported only $1,237 in taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
Jigger said Sturman used "the most state-of-art tax evasion" methods and the 
government probably only learned of a portion of his income.

GRANT TO FUND 7 CITY BUSES POWERED BY NATURAL GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Transit Corp. is about to embark on an experiment that may lead to 
cleaner-running buses. The catalyst is a $1.3-million grant from the federal 
Urban Mass Transportation Administration that San Diego Transit will use to 
purchase seven buses powered by compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
The natural, high-pressure gas is less polluting than gasoline or diesel fuel. 
Officials hope that cleaner buses will encourage more people to leave their 
cars at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We already feel that bus service is one of the major contributors of clean air 
because we get all those dirty automobiles off the road," said Roger Snoble, 
president and general manager of San Diego Transit. "If we can take that black 
cloud away from our buses, we'll be even more effective in helping to clean the 
air." 
</P>
<P>
The grant was announced Monday by Brian W. Clymer, head of the federal agency, 
at a meeting in San Diego of American Public Transit Assn., a nationwide 
organization of transit-system operators. 
</P>
<P>
A request for bids to build the buses has already been published, and Snoble 
expects to have the buses on the road by mid-1991. The seven, 40-foot long 
buses will run on regular routes and will be evaluated over five years. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E will build a compressed natural gas refueling station at San Diego 
Transit's Imperial Avenue facility. The station will cost $460,000. SDG&amp;E 
will bear two-thirds of the building cost and San Diego Transit will contribute 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
The utility will sell the compressed natural gas at a price comparable to what 
the transit company pays for diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The new buses will be able to travel 400 to 500 miles without refueling and 
will travel up to about 55 m.p.h., about the same as with diesel fuel, said 
Jennifer K. Sansone, new products and services administrator for SDG&amp;E. An 
additional advantage to using natural gas is that it is a domestic resource, 
Sansone said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Transit is one of the first transit companies to receive a an UMTA 
grant for the natural gas buses, Snoble said. 
</P>
<P>
Transit systems, in Europe and Canada as well as Los Angeles and a private bus 
company in Brooklyn, also are experimenting with compressed natural gas as a 
fuel for buses, Snoble said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the way to go," he said.

Over the objections of Mayor Maureen O'Connor, San Diego City Council members 
Monday approved 8.8% salary increases for O'Connor and themselves, their first 
pay raises in three years. 
</P>
<P>
The two-step pay increase takes effect July 1, when salaries for the eight 
council members will rise from the current $45,000 annually to $47,000. On the 
same day, O'Connor's $60,000 salary will increase to $62,650. 
</P>
<P>
Council members' salaries will increase to $49,000 on July 1, 1991. O'Connor's 
salary will jump to $65,300 the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's approval of the recommendations by the city's Salary Setting 
Commission came at a politically awkward time for the council, which today will 
consider requests for more than $300,000 to pay for new staff members in six 
council offices and the physical remodeling of two members' offices. 
</P>
<P>
Although the request is just a small portion of a proposed $4-million, mid-year 
budget increase, it has proved unpopular with some constituents, especially in 
light of the council's warning that it faces a budget crisis in fiscal 1991 if 
more revenue cannot be found. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council agreed to raise property taxes by $20 million and 
tentatively voted to ask voters for authority to generate an additional $81.7 
million via a variety of new taxes. Mayor Maureen O'Connor Monday called for 
reconsideration of the $20-million tax increase, arguing that the increase 
should be placed before voters. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor cast the only dissenting vote on Monday's salary increase, though 
Councilman Bruce Henderson, who was present for most of the rest of the council 
session, was absent. Council members Abbe Wolfsheimer, Ron Roberts, John 
Hartley, Wes Pratt, Linda Bernhardt, Judy McCarty and Bob Filner voted for the 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor argued once again that voters should approve the salary increases. 
"The salaries should go on the ballot and let the people decide," she said. 
None of her colleagues voiced opinions on the politically sensitive issue. 
</P>
<P>
Council salaries have not increased since July 1, 1987, when they rose from 
$40,000 to the current $45,000, as part of a two-stage increase approved in 
1986. On July 1, 1986, their salaries increased from $35,000 to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, O'Connor's salary increased from $50,000 to $55,000 in 1986, and to 
the current $60,000 on July 1, 1987. The mayor does not take home all of her 
pay, choosing to devote $10,000 to supplement her staff's salaries. 
</P>
<P>
In a report to the council, Salary Setting Commission President John Nersesian 
said the pay increase recommendation "attempts to balance a fair compensation 
level, which considers the positions' responsibilities, with the city's overall 
fiscal and budgetary needs and constraints. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommendation came after two public hearings and six meetings 
at which the panel reviewed financial data.

AZTECS LOSE CENTER DOW FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
San Diego State center Marty Dow will undergo surgery this afternoon for a 
partially torn tendon in his right foot and ankle and be lost to the team for 
the remainder of the season, team physician Dr. Peter Wile said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dow's foot has been sore for nearly two months, and Wile said Dow was X-rayed 
before the team left for a trip to Utah Jan. 31. The test showed a partial tear 
in the tendon, and then Dow aggravated it Feb. 3 at Utah when he was stepped on 
by teammate Vern Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question he was going to have surgery at the end of the season," 
Wile said. "The last injury and the intense pain just forced our hand." 
</P>
<P>
The first prescription for Dow, who has had a couple of cortisone shots for the 
foot this season, was several days of rest. But Wile said Dow went to SDSU 
trainer Mark Haines late last week and said the foot wasn't getting any better. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically said he was in enough pain that he didn't want to wait until the 
end of the season," Wile said. "In the past, it's always gotten better. But 
since the recent aggravation, he has been in constant pain." 
</P>
<P>
Dow, a 7-foot-1 junior, was unavailable for comment. He was averaging 12 points 
and six rebounds a game and, until Saturday's victory over U.S. International 
University, was one of just two Aztecs to start every game this season. Shawn 
Jamison is the other. 
</P>
<P>
"(Marty) is not a guy who will whimper over a minor pain," SDSU Coach Jim 
Brandenburg said. "He's been in uncomfortable pain since the injury happened a 
week ago Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Wile said today's surgery should take about 45 minutes and that the success 
rate for this type of surgery is "in the high 90% range." According to Wile, 
Dow will be in a cast for about six weeks, after which he can start to 
rehabilitate. But he said it would be a minimum of two-and-a-half to three 
months before Dow can jump or run hard. 
</P>
<P>
If everything goes according to schedule, Wile said, Dow should be able to 
resume playing basketball this summer and be ready for the start of SDSU 
basketball practice next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison, a 6-8 forward, will now be asked to swing over to center at times, 
along with 6-11 Neal Steinly. Jamison is SDSU's leading scorer at 16 points a 
game. Steinly is averaging just 1.2 points and six minutes a game. Other than 
Jamison and Steinly, the Aztecs have nobody taller than 6-6 on their roster. 
They also have only nine players on their roster for the remainder of the 
season -- and just seven were on the floor by the end of Monday's practice. 
Point guard Rodney Jones is recovering from a sprained ankle and his practice 
time has been limited during the past week, and reserve guard Kevin Honaker 
missed practice Monday with a strained calf, suffered running across a parking 
lot Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to start working hard and adjusting our player rotation, chemistry and 
shot distribution," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Steinly started at center against USIU Saturday, but Brandenburg could also go 
with a smaller lineup consisting of Jamison at center and swingman Michael 
Hudson (6-5) at forward. Dow's injury will also mean more playing time for 
Eeric White (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
"We can't sustain a whole game with Steinly at center, and we can't sustain a 
whole game with Jamison at center," Brandenburg said. "No matter how we start, 
Steinly, Jamison and White have to come through on occasion. And Hudson is a 
physical player, so he will have to step inside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a great situation for us, but if we respond positively I think we can 
get some things done."

SWEETWATER GETS TITLE, CHULA VISTA GIVES SCARE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chula Vista came within seconds of doing what no other team in California had 
done this year -- defeat the Sweetwater High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista held an eight-point lead with two minutes 47 seconds remaining, but 
then it was tied with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Sweetwater's Joe McDowell sank two free throws to sink Chula 
Vista's hope of an upset at home against the county's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater's 73-71 victory in front of a standing-room-only Monday night crowd 
gave Sweetwater the Metro Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Devils, whose only loss was to a Seattle team in a tournament in 
Burnaby, Canada, are 24-1, 11-0. Sweetwater has just one game remaining against 
Bonita Vista before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista, previously ranked 10th, fell to 19-7, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
After McDowell (21 points) made his free throws, Chula Vista zipped the ball 
upcourt where Shane Howell attempted a 19-foot shot from the right baseline. 
The ball carommed off the front of the rim and over with one second left. A 
Chula Vista player grabbed the rebound and was fouled, but time had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Sent to the line with seven seconds left, McDowell, a senior guard, said he was 
thinking about all the free throws he had missed (four) earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend Carlos (Campbell) told me its just like in practice, McDowell said. 
"(He told me) take my time and take my mind off the crowd. Once I made the 
first one, I knew the second was going down." 
</P>
<P>
The trend of the game was such: Sweetwater would build a lead -- normally four 
to seven points -- and Chula Vista would scramble back close. 
</P>
<P>
But that changed late in the third quarter when Chula Vista turned a six-point 
deficit into a 62-53 lead by scoring 15 unanswered points. 
</P>
<P>
Carnell Penn, who led all scorers with 29 points, scored 10 in the run, 
including the first six. "All I was thinking about was bringing the team back," 
Penn said. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Green then gave Chula Vista its first lead since the first quarter, 
55-53, with an 18-footer and added a free throw eight seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
The only other Spartan to score in the run was Derek Chapman, who tipped in his 
own missed shot with one second left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:47 in the fourth, Chula Vista held a 68-60 lead, but Sweetwater scored 
nine of the next 10 tying it, 69-69, with 1:21 left on Campbell's tip of a 
McDowell missed free throw. Campbell finished with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
After Penn made a layup, Sweetwater reserve Isaac Bruce made a layup with 18 
seconds left to tie it, 71-71, and set up McDowell's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater took the opening tip and assumed an 8-0 lead after nearly three 
minutes. McDowell scored the first six points and Mendel Nafarrete added a 
17-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista could do little right early on, but soon found its groove.

SANTIAGO AND PADRES GO TO COURT TODAY 
</P>

<P>
After four weeks of futile negotiations, catcher Benito Santiago and his agent 
decided Monday that they will take the Padres to court this morning for an 
arbitration hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, seeking a Padre arbitration-record $1.25 million, and the Padres, who 
offered $750,000, never came close to reaching a settlement, sources said, once 
Santiago filed for arbitration Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Each side will present their case at 9:30 a.m. today in front of arbitrator Tom 
Roberts. He has 72 hours to render a decision, and must choose one of the two 
numbers without compromising. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a case where I wanted to go, but I have to go," Santiago said. "I 
like our chances. I think it's about a 90% chance we'll win." 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, Padre vice president/baseball operations, spoke briefly Monday 
morning with Santiago's agent, Scott Boras, but no counter-offer was made. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to him (Boras) to see if he's interested in anything," McKeon said, 
"but they thought they had a strong case. We just didn't get together. Now, 
we'll see what someone else thinks." 
</P>
<P>
Boras said: "We weren't going to settle this case unless they offered something 
very close to the figure we filed. We obviously believe we have a strong case, 
and we have the evidence to support that Benito is worth the money we're 
asking." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who earned $345,000 last season, batted .236 while leading National 
League catchers with 16 homers and 62 RBIs. If he wins the arbitration ruling, 
he'll become the eighth Padre player to earn an average salary of at least $1 
million in 1990.

HOME PRICES DROP 3% FROM DECEMBER AS MARKET SLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The average resale price of a single-family house in the San Fernando Valley 
fell 3% to $298,300 in January from $308,500 in December, the San Fernando 
Valley Board of Realtors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The price level still marked a 13% increase from the average price in January, 
1989, of $263,600. 
</P>
<P>
The local housing market continued to be sluggish in January as a flood of 
sellers put their houses on the market last month, boosting the number of new 
listings of single-family homes 111% in January to 2,721 from 1,288 in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Sales, meanwhile, increased 9% to 770 in January from 708 in December. But 
sales still fell 27% short of levels a year ago, when a total of 1,057 were 
sold in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The average resale price of a condominium meanwhile reached a record high of 
$156,200 in January, up 1% from $154,700 in December. The latest monthly figure 
was 17% higher than in January, 1989, when the average resale price was 
$133,100. 
</P>
<P>
The number of condominiums resold increased 7% in January to 304 from 284 in 
December. But condominium resales were 13% lower than in January, 1989, when 
349 were resold. 
</P>
<P>
The board called the sales of single-family homes "sluggish" in a release, but 
predicted that falling or only slowly increasing prices would lead to more 
sales volume. 
</P>
<P>
"Because listings are high, a buyers' market exists which is forcing owners who 
must sell to reconsider the amount of profit they're willing to accept," said 
Jim Link, the board's executive vice president. "Owners have finally realized 
that they are not losing money by lowering their asking price, since you cannot 
lose what you never had." 
</P>
<P>
Link predicted that increasing prices would soon slow condominium sales. "I 
think you'll see the same pattern we're seeing now in single-family homes: 
excessive pricing drags sales down, listings back up." Eventually, Link said, 
"owners readjust prices, sales resume and the market seeks a new level." 
</P>
<P>
Fixed-rate mortgages have begun to climb in recent weeks and on average are now 
higher than 10%, which could slow any comeback in the local housing market. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and 
condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its 
statistics do not include most new residences.

PARTNER SUES FOR CONTROL OF EGG FARM; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: EGG CITY, WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF FINANCIAL AND LABOR PROBLEMS, IS 
CHARGED WITH DEFAULTING ON LOANS FROM A JAPANESE TRADING FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ownership of 3 million hens laying 2 million eggs each day was put at stake 
Feb. 2 when the Japanese partner in Egg City, once the world's largest egg 
ranch, sued to take control of the huge Moorpark farm. 
</P>
<P>
Okura-America, the U.S. arm of Japanese trading company Okura &amp; Co., 
alleged that Careau Group, the owner of 60% of Egg City, has defaulted on $30 
million in loans and wants to foreclose on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
According to a lawsuit filed by Okura in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
Careau has failed to meet loan agreements, including payments on the $13 
million Okura originally lent Egg City in exchange for a 40% interest in the 
farm. That loan helped bring Egg City out of bankruptcy proceedings in 
December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney representing Careau, Michael McCann, claimed that Okura planned 
all along to take over Egg City. McCann said the Japanese investment should be 
rescinded because it was structured unfairly, allowing Okura to force Egg City 
into default and take control of the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a hidden agenda, and that will be the focus of our response," 
said Richard Carrott, Egg City's chief executive who owns 90% of Careau, giving 
him 54% control of the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph D. Kirwan, Okura's attorney, denied the charge. "My client tried to help 
Mr. Carrott, and not hurt him," Kirwan said. 
</P>
<P>
Okura claims it pumped a total of $30 million in loans into the ailing ranch, 
but that Egg City continues to show operating losses of $500,000 a month. 
Careau is currently about $19.8 million behind in principal and interest 
payments to Okura, according to Kirwan. 
</P>
<P>
McCann claimed, however, that the debt figures are exaggerated because they 
include cash that Okura invested to improve the farm's operations and wasn't 
intended to be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Egg City has faced a host of problems, including the bankruptcy 
filing and a bitter and protracted dispute with the United Farm Workers (UFW) 
over a $2-per-hour wage cut and a worker vote to end union representation at 
the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1986, when Egg City sold about $45-million worth of eggs, the 
Guinness Book of World Records called the egg ranch the biggest in the world, 
but an Ohio farm has since taken that title. The 29-year old ranch, which 
mostly makes dried egg products for food companies, was sold in 1979 by its 
founder, Julius Goldman, to Kroger Co., the Cincinnati-based grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Careau Group, 10% of which is owned by Carrott's partner Gerald Rosen, 
bought Egg City from Kroger for an undisclosed sum in 1985. Carrott is a former 
television actor who had parts in "Love Boat" and "Three's Company" and played 
Cadet Capt. Chris Gentry in a Saturday morning children's show. 
</P>
<P>
The UFW, which began representing about 240 workers at Egg City in 1978, 
launched a strike against Egg City in 1986, after the ranch filed for 
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. At 
the time Carrott said the ranch was losing about $300,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Carrott blamed the losses on labor costs and asked the bankruptcy court to 
approve a $2-per-hour cut in wages for workers, most of whom made from $6.07 to 
$7.69 an hour. But the UFW said Carrott hadn't negotiated fairly or released 
enough financial details about Egg City to prove the wage cuts were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The court upheld the wage cut, but the strike continued, even as Egg City 
replaced many of the striking workers. During 1986, striking workers organized 
pickets and boycotts against wholesalers, restaurants and grocery stores that 
bought eggs from the ranch. In November, 1986, a majority of Egg City employees 
-- including strikers and their replacements -- voted to end UFW representation 
at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Egg City won a pair of rulings by the state Agricultural Labor 
Relations Board -- one declaring the workers' vote valid despite UFW 
objections, and one calling the UFW's boycott illegal because the union didn't 
tell the public that its labor dispute was with the ranch, not the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Okura decided to help Egg City out of bankruptcy because the ranch was an 
important supplier of eggs, which the company imported to Japan, said Okura's 
attorney, Kirwan. Okura has been one of Egg City's biggest customers, buying 
about $5.7-million worth of eggs between April 1, l987, and March 30, 1988, 
according to Kirwan. 
</P>
<P>
Okura claims it was disappointed that Egg City continued to lose money even 
after using the $13 million to partially pay off creditors. Okura continued 
lending money to Careau, including about $10.26 million to buy grain when 
suppliers demanded payments up front, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
But McCann, Careau's attorney, claimed that Okura knew its initial $13-million 
investment wouldn't end Egg City's problems. "Nobody with more than a day's 
experience in business could have believed" it would be enough, McCann said.

canopy of 24-foot-high ceilings and skylights, fills with well-heeled patrons. 
A few minutes later the restaurant's manager, Christopher Niklas, whose father, 
Kurt, founded the Bistro and the Bistro Garden restaurants in Beverly Hills, 
stops by Piken's table to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
Piken, 65, is proud of the restaurant and the center which opened the first 
week of February. His Studio City company, The Piken Co., developed the Center 
at Coldwater, located on the southwest corner of Ventura Boulevard and 
Coldwater Canyon at the Studio City and Sherman Oaks line. Piken, who has built 
several other shopping centers along Ventura Boulevard during his 30-year 
career, considers the Center at Coldwater an example of "suburban elegance." 
</P>
<P>
But the center also became his suburban nightmare. The venture was extremely 
controversial. Well-publicized protests by nearby homeowners, who griped that 
the development would produce traffic congestion and parking problems, forced 
Piken to make several major changes that pushed construction back a year and 
put it $2 million over budget. 
</P>
<P>
Last May the cost overruns forced Piken to strike a new deal with his bank, 
Security Pacific, that turned the center's control over to the bank and cut 
Piken's share of future profits from half to as little as 15%. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the center is nearly empty. At the moment, the only tenant is the 
Bistro Garden, whose lease Piken arranged. Security Pacific has been in charge 
of leasing the building since it took control, but James Rupp, senior vice 
president of Security Pacific Development, acknowledged of the remaining 36,000 
square feet available, only about 4,000 has been leased. 
</P>
<P>
Rupp said the bank expects the center to be fully occupied within 18 months. 
But he said leasing the building has been slowed by the same delays in getting 
zoning approvals and completing nearby street expansions that hobbled Piken. 
</P>
<P>
Some commercial real estate brokers said the center's low occupancy to date 
also probably stems from a recent flurry of commercial building in the area, 
which has given retailers lots of sites to consider. They suggested that 
another cause might be Security Pacific's decision to hire a leasing agent, 
Jarvis &amp; Associates, located in San Francisco, not the San Fernando 
Valley.. 
</P>
<P>
But Rupp said the leasing effort "had to be restarted from scratch" after the 
bank took control and predicted the program should be "closing some deals very 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the reasons, Piken said, the situation is "very disgusting and 
very frustrating and it's an embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
The Center at Coldwater points up how developing commercial properties in the 
Valley has changed in the past decade as the population and commercial density, 
particularly along Ventura Boulevard, has increased and the public has become 
more vocal in how projects are approved. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a city plan to limit development along Ventura Boulevard was released 
Monday and is scheduled to have its first hearing before the city Planning 
Commission on Feb. 22. The proposal, among other things, calls for tying the 
size of projects to the amount of additional traffic they generate. (See story 
on page B3.) 
</P>
<P>
"You can't go in any more and just knock down a gas station and the old Denny's 
restaurant and build a 21-story building," said Richard H. Close, a lawyer and 
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., which was Piken's main opponent 
in the Center at Coldwater battle. 
</P>
<P>
Piken recalled how, in 1986, he originally envisioned a three-story Center at 
Coldwater with 78,000 square feet of space to lease. He ended up, though, 
trimming the project's size by about 40%. Piken said, "I wanted to do something 
very upscale because I thought the Valley was ready for such a development. . . 
," and he compared his vision to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Piken had already spent $4.5 million to buy the property, which had been the 
site of the Tail O' the Cock restaurant. Actually, the money came from Security 
Pacific, which committed up to $18 million to Piken to develop the center, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was not unusual for commercial development: Security Pacific 
put up the cash, and Piken put up his talent. As developer, he hires the 
architects, engineers and construction companies, gets building permits and, in 
many cases, leases space in the project. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Piken was to pay back the bank loan plus interest after the 
center opened, and any profits from the center over and above Piken's loan 
payment were to be split 50-50 with Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1987, Piken unveiled his plan to the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. 
"and that's when everything hit the fan," he recalled. From that point on, the 
group and others complained that without changes, the center would snarl 
traffic and neighborhood parking. The Sherman Oaks homeowners also contended 
that if the Bistro Garden was granted a liquor license, some intoxicated 
customers would stumble down their streets or urinate in public. 
</P>
<P>
Piken and others were outraged. "It's absolutely a slap in the face to Mr. 
Niklas and what he has accomplished" with his restaurants, said Sondre 
Frohlich, executive director of the Studio City Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant got its liquor license, but the neighbors put enough pressure on 
city regulators to force other major changes in the center. Piken had to scrap 
his original design and ended up building a much smaller two-story center. 
</P>
<P>
He also was ordered to widen Ventura Boulevard along the front of the center; 
widen nearby sections of Coldwater Canyon Avenue and change the signal lights 
to improve traffic flow on Coldwater Canyon and its on-ramps to the Ventura 
Freeway. Piken said the changes cost more than $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
But in effect they cost Piken much more. As the changes pushed construction 
further behind schedule, the venture began running well over budget. Piken said 
he was personally liable for the Security Pacific loan and the situation was 
"scaring the hell out of me." 
</P>
<P>
So last May, Piken and Security Pacific renegotiated their deal, and Security 
Pacific agreed to effectively cancel Piken's loan in exchange for control of 
the center and a bigger cut of the future profits, he said. Now, instead of 
getting half the profits, Piken said he will receive between 15% and 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Will he make any money on the Center at Coldwater? "Probably not," Piken said. 
He said that although the center has "tremendous potential because of its 
design and location," he is troubled by the inability of Security Pacific and 
Jarvis &amp; Associates to have signed up more tenants by now. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless somebody, whether it's me or somebody else, gets in there who knows 
what they're doing about developing shopping centers, it could be screwed up 
and the whole thing could be made less valuable," Piken said. "And it's got to 
reach its full potential for me to make any money on it." 
</P>
<P>
What bothers him most, Piken said, is that the Center at Coldwater mess 
tarnished his reputation through no fault of his own. 
</P>
<P>
But Piken's adversary, Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said Piken 
shoulders some of the blame because he was unwilling to compromise with the 
homeowners, thus causing delays. 
</P>
<P>
"When it really got heated, we tried to meet with him to try to resolve the 
issues," Close said. "He thought he had the votes" in the Los Angeles City 
Council "and didn't need to compromise with the homeowners. And he was right. 
He had the votes with the City Council. But what it cost him was time," and the 
time cost him money, Close said. 
</P>
<P>
Close, in fact, said "everybody lost" in the Center at Coldwater fight. "The 
homeowners didn't get as much as they needed to protect their neighborhood," 
including more traffic lights and restrictions on when the Bistro Garden could 
be open. "And he didn't get what he wanted," Close said of Piken. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only winner was the Bistro Garden. Christopher Niklas said the 
restaurant is not worried about how soon the center fills up. "We're very 
confident with or without tenants around us," he said.

 Bishop Inc., a struggling Agoura Hills producer of engineering and design 
equipment, has hired John J. Theiss as its new president and chief executive. 
He succeeds Kenneth J. Kay, who resigned to work elsewhere but who remains a 
director of Bishop. Richard M. Drysdale remains Bishop's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Theiss, 53, most recently was chief executive of Cardkey Systems, a Simi Valley 
producer of card-controlled security systems, such as those used to lock hotel 
rooms. He earlier spent 16 years at Xerox Corp. as a manager in its engineering 
products group. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, formerly called Bishop Graphics, has posted major losses in recent 
years, largely because it failed to keep pace with the computerization of its 
industry. Bishop chiefly supplies engineers and drafting professionals with 
equipment to design electronic circuit boards, and much of the work is now done 
with computerized workstations. 
</P>
<P>
In its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, Bishop lost $355,000 on revenue of 
$10.2 million, and it lost $2.5 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
However, Theiss said Bishop has stepped up its own sales of computerized 
workstations through its InterCad unit, and that its cost-cutting steps have 
made Bishop profitable since Sept. 30. In the quarter that ended Dec. 31, 
Bishop reported pretax earnings of $38,000, compared with a pretax loss of 
$35,000 a year earlier. A $211,000 tax gain a year ago gave Bishop net income 
of $176,000. 
</P>
<P>
Theiss said he wants to expand Bishop's role in the workstation marketplace, 
while protecting Bishop's share of the market for more manual 
engineering-design supplies.

health-care programs and services, said it named Darrel C. Neuenschwander vice 
president of financial operations for its nine medical centers. Neuenschwander 
most recently was senior vice president and chief financial officer at Summit 
Health Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
* HemaCare Corp., the Sherman Oaks blood products and services company, said it 
appointed George H. Fekas as vice president, sales and marketing. Fekas was 
previously administrator of the West Tennessee Regional Blood Center in 
Jackson, Tenn.

VALLEY EARNINGS: ZENITH NATIONAL PROFIT FALLS 43% IN 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zenith National Insurance Corp. said its fourth-quarter profit tumbled 43% from 
a year earlier on little change in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Woodland Hills insurer said its net income dropped to $5.3 million in the 
quarter that ended Dec. 31 from $9.24 million a year earlier, while its revenue 
inched up to $115.9 million from $115.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarter reflected, among other things, a net loss of about $2 
million related to the earthquake in Northern California last fall, Zenith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, Zenith's profit fell 11%, to $41.1 million from $46.3 million 
the previous year, and its annual revenue rose to $483.9 million from $472 
million.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pinkerton's Inc., the nation's biggest security guard company, plans to raise 
up to $21 million with an initial public offering of 1.3 million common shares. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Van Nuys-based

BODY-FAT CALCULATORS WEIGH IN

<P>
Southern Californians are hooking up to some unusual machines these days in the 
name of fitness. 
</P>
<P>
They are shooting beams of infrared light into their biceps or allowing 
electrodes to be attached to their hands and feet. They are plunging underwater 
on a cadaver scale or enduring the humiliation of having their "love handles" 
squeezed by a stranger wielding calipers. 
</P>
<P>
All of these procedures measure body fat, and they have become popular 
offerings in some Southern California health clubs, weight-control centers and 
wellness clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I do fitness testing, (body fat) is the issue that everyone wants to talk 
about," said Ellen Turkel, a consultant for corporate wellness programs and 
health clubs. "You can talk about flexibility until you're blue in the face, 
but when you start talking about body fat, they're on the edge of their seats." 
</P>
<P>
Experts caution, however, that as testing and new machinery proliferate, so 
does the chance of getting inaccurate or misleading results. They urge anyone 
undergoing body-fat tests to consider the skill of the test-givers, pretest 
conditions and equipment limitations for each of the five most common 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that high-tech gets a lot of publicity because it looks exciting and 
because people who are trying to sell products are pushing them," said Paul 
Schmidt, a fitness specialist with the city of San Diego. "But things are 
misused quite often." 
</P>
<P>
Body fat isn't all evil. Layered under the skin and packed around organs, fat 
insulates the body from cold, cushions it against injury and supplies it with 
essential everyday fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Too much body fat, however, increases a person's risk of hypertension, diabetes 
and high cholesterol, among other problems. 
</P>
<P>
A study done at San Diego's Naval Health Research Center, to be published this 
year, concluded that men with more than 22% fat and women with more than 33% 
fat are at significant health risk. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, "ideal" body fat percentages vary. Depending on whom you ask, a 
healthy rate for men ranges anywhere from 6% to 25%, while a healthy woman's 
body fat can range from 9% to as high as 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Health clubs and wellness centers that test body fat typically use one of five 
procedures: the old standards of underwater weighing, skin-fold calipers and 
circumference equations and the newer infrared technology and bio-electrical 
impedance machines, which conduct low-level electricity through the body. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Schmidt compared the five procedures in a study on 75 police 
officer trainees -- a primarily young and relatively fit test population. His 
results rated skin-fold calipers as the second most accurate method behind 
underwater weighing, the "gold standard" of body-fat testing. Circumference 
equations came in next, followed by the infrared technique and, finally, the 
bio-electrical impedance. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Lohman, a professor and researcher in the University of Arizona's 
department of exercise and sports sciences, ranks the methods differently, 
based on studies with participants more typical of the average population. 
</P>
<P>
He says impedance, "if the machine is reliable," and skin-fold calipers, if the 
tester is well-trained, come in second to underwater weighing. Circumference 
measurements are third. Infrared, which is so new that it hasn't been widely 
tested in independent studies, is the least reliable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a rundown on each of the five testing methods. 
</P>
<P>
INFRARED 
</P>
<P>
The infrared machine, marketed under the name Futrex 5000, is an outgrowth of 
U.S. Department of Agriculture research on pig fat. It operates on the premise 
that fat refracts light differently than muscle and bone do. 
</P>
<P>
Using a wand attached to a small hand-held microprocessor, the instrument 
shoots a beam of infrared light into the body halfway between the shoulder and 
elbow on the biceps of the person's dominant arm. Manufacturer Futrex Inc., of 
Gaithersburg, Md., claims that fat measured here is directly proportional to 
total body fat. 
</P>
<P>
The infrared light beam passes quickly through fat, then bends as it hits 
muscle and bone. The machine calculates percent body fat as it measures that 
bend. 
</P>
<P>
The Futrex machine costs about $2,000, according to Tori Tunnell, sales manager 
for the company. He said that individual tests, while most often included in a 
comprehensive body-composition analysis and wellness screening package, can 
cost as little as $15. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Rams have included the machine in their body-fat testing 
equipment. But the team uses the machine for spot checking all over the body, 
according to Garrett Giemont, the team's strength trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the Futrex 5000 liken it to a blood pressure test. There is no 
need to remove clothes, lie down, be dunked under water or meet pretest 
conditions, they say. The instrument also allows for self-testing. 
</P>
<P>
But Anita Jones, health promotion director for Accents on Health, a San Diego 
wellness clinic, said the machine isn't nearly as easy to operate as its 
instructions indicate. To find the right spot at the "belly" of the biceps 
takes a lot of practice, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lohman said that although he hasn't yet tested the machine, one of its 
limitations is that, unlike the other methods, the manufacturer suggests only 
one measurement location to determine total percent body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern, exercise physiologists say, is that the infrared light beam 
shoots only a limited distance into the body, and that could affect the 
accuracy of measurements on obese people. 
</P>
<P>
But a company spokesman says the depth of the light beam is accounted for in 
the machine's software and that the beam is but one of the variables entered 
into the software's equation that determines percent body fat. Other variables 
include activity level, height, weight, gender and body frame. 
</P>
<P>
BIO-ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE 
</P>
<P>
The bio-impedance method, out for about four years, measures resistance to 
electricity to determine percent body fat. Operators attach two electrodes each 
to specific locations on the foot and hand through which they introduce a 
low-energy, high-frequency electrical current. 
</P>
<P>
Lean muscle, which has high water content, easily conducts the electricity, 
while fat resists. Measurement of that resistance predicts the body fat 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla Scientific, a San Diego-based company, is one of the industry's top 
two manufacturers of the machines, which cost between $2,500 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some exercise physiologists point out that many variables can affect body fat 
measured with this equipment. When a person last ate, drank and exercised can 
influence results of the test, which costs from $40 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get reliable measurements," said Turkel, the corporate wellness 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "I think they're on the cutting edge, and in the next few 
years, people will be considering it more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla's operation manual cautions that to ensure accurate test results, the 
following conditions should be avoided: participation in heavy exercise within 
eight hours of the test; water loss or dehydration due to hot weather, exercise 
or inadequate fluid intake; consumption of excessive quantities of food within 
six hours of the test, of water within four hours, of caffeine within three 
hours, or of alcohol within 48 hours; fasting within 72 hours of the test; 
using the bathroom more than an hour before the test, and excessive water 
retention during the three days before a woman's menstrual period and seven 
days afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla trains anyone who buys the equipment to observe the pretest 
conditions, Clark said. "Proper medical procedure is like any other test." 
</P>
<P>
SKIN-FOLD CALIPERS 
</P>
<P>
Skin-fold calipers, developed in the 1930s to measure the fat content of pigs 
on their way to market, are perhaps the best known devices used to measure body 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
Operators use a plier-shaped apparatus -- one of a dozen types -- to pinch 
flesh in three or more body locations. Readings are correlated with an equation 
that takes into consideration a person's gender, height, weight and age. The 
equations are particular to specific calipers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not old-fashioned, but the old-fashioned calipers really seem to work," 
Turkel said. "It's done on so many people that they're quite reliable." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the YMCA has used calipers to measure body fat for several decades, 
said Don Hanna, who sits on the organization's national program development 
committee. Though the Y recently has been "deluged" by companies selling newer 
machines, corporate researchers have decided to stick with calipers for the 
foreseeable future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the test is simple enough for the recipient, experts say the procedure 
is frequently mishandled by untrained or inexperienced operators. When that 
happens, the average error rate can rise to as much as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS 
</P>
<P>
After considering the use of skin-fold calipers to test its personnel 
nationwide, the Navy went with circumference measurements. According to Jim 
Hodgdon, a Naval Health Research Center program director, results are generally 
as good as skin folds and the method is much more easily taught to operators. 
</P>
<P>
Simple, tape-measured dimensions -- such as a man's neck, abdomen and height -- 
are plugged into equations similar to those for calipers. Results have 
generally been on a par with skin folds, often with less of an error margin, 
said Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as accurate as anything else," he said. "These are numbers that are very 
practical, and people can relate to them. I strongly suggest a move back toward 
use of circumference measurements." 
</P>
<P>
UNDERWATER WEIGHING 
</P>
<P>
Using the principal that fat floats, while muscle and bone sink, underwater 
weighing actually measures the amount of water your submerged body displaces. 
That figure helps estimate body density, which in turn predicts percent body 
fat. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater weighing is certainly the most inconvenient of techniques. 
Typically, only a few hospitals, universities and athletic teams have the 
equipment. (Tests cost about $50 to the public.) To be tested, a person must 
don a bathing suit, balance on what has traditionally been a cadaver scale, 
exhale all of his or her breath and hold it out for as long as possible 
underwater, repeating the procedure six or seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not practical for most settings," Turkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Though other methods gauge their accuracy by hydrostatic body-fat measurements, 
the technique isn't without its own errors, fitness experts say. Consider the 
results logged for several world-class athletes: less than 1% body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that occurs because the method assumes the same muscle and bone 
density for everyone, regardless of ethnic, gender and age differences. 
</P>
<P>
"That can't possibly be true," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
For most accurate results, residual air volume -- or the air left in your lungs 
and esophagus also must be measured. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the method chosen, experts urge common sense in dealing with 
body-fat test results.

Caloric restrictions and aerobic exercise are the only ways to reduce body fat, 
though weight reduction doesn't automatically mean a reduction in fat. 
</P>
<P>
And there's no such thing as spot reducing. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I lose it off my thighs or off my tummy?" Carter said. "The answer is, in 
general, no. You lose it overall." 
</P>
<P>
Carter and other experts also counsel those rushing to measure body fat not to 
place too much emphasis on a small aspect of overall wellness. 
</P>
<P>
"People are taking these things very seriously these days -- a little too 
seriously," Lohman said. "So many people are so dissatisfied with their 
(results) but are in a very healthy range." 
</P>
<P>
Said Schmidt: "We get too hung up on our body-fat assessment versus looking at 
the big picture of health and wellness and life style. When body fat preempts 
that, we're missing the point."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PORNOGRAPHER GETS 10 YEARS, $2.46-MILLION 
FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reuben Sturman, described in a 1986 presidential report as the world's largest 
distributor of pornography, was sentenced Monday in Cleveland, Ohio, to 10 
years in prison and fined $2.46 million for evading taxes on millions of 
dollars in income. 
</P>
<P>
Sturman, 65, who maintains a 5,610-square-foot, Tudor-style house in Van Nuys 
and another residence in the Cleveland area, was convicted Nov. 17 of failing 
to report $2.7 million in income from 1978 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge George White continued his $1-million cash bond pending 
appeals. Sturman also is awaiting trial in federal court in Las Vegas on 
charges of racketeering and interstate transportation of obscene material. If 
convicted on those charges, he could receive 75 years in prison and a 
$22.5-million fine.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KAHANE SPEAKS AT USC AFTER MONTHS OF DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Militant Rabbi Meir Kahane finally got a chance to speak at USC on Monday, to a 
group of about 65 people, while protesters outside compared him to Adolf Hitler 
because of his controversial plan to expel Arabs from all Israeli-held 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, the American-born leader of Israel's nationalistic Kach movement, had 
first been scheduled to speak on campus last November. 
</P>
<P>
But USC officials cancelled the visit, fearing his presence could incite 
violence. He was invited to speak Monday after security arrangements were made. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane's speech centered on an attack on "Jewish liberals" who believe that 
Jews and Arabs can coexist in the Middle East. But the former Israeli Knesset 
member told his audience in Hancock Auditorium that he was not a racist, 
adding: "Racism states that any group or people are permanently inferior to 
mine. I say that any Arab who wishes to become Jewish can become Jewish." 
</P>

$175,000 SETTLEMENT VOTED FOR 6 INMATES IN JAIL BEATING CASE; 
</P>
<P>
BRUTALITY SUIT: THE BLACK PRISONERS SAID THAT THEY WERE INJURED BY DEPUTIES AND 
SUBJECTED TO RACIAL TAUNTS. COUNTY CLAIMS PANEL SAYS EXCESSIVE FORCE MAY HAVE 
BEEN USED.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Claims Board on Monday approved a $175,000 settlement 
with six black inmates who claimed in a lawsuit that they had been beaten by 
sheriff's deputies at the Hall of Justice jail and subjected to racial taunts. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which will be considered next week by the Board of Supervisors, 
was adopted by the three-person claims panel, whose members said deputies at 
the downtown jail may have used excessive force against the inmates during two 
incidents on June 3, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputies and a number of inmates were injured during a fight that 
morning and in a series of inmate searches later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
The fight began when Deputy Kevin Forcier ordered inmate Bill (Ronald) Rushing 
off the telephone as other inmates in his jail module were leaving for 
breakfast. The confrontation quickly escalated into a fight after Forcier 
yelled racial slurs at Rushing and slammed him against iron bars when he failed 
to end the call promptly, according to the inmate. 
</P>
<P>
As the two men fought, other deputies began beating Rushing, the lawsuit said. 
The deputies then turned on inmate Sammy E. Carlyle and another inmate in the 
jail module, the prisoners claimed. Another inmate, plaintiff Michael Jackson, 
also said he was taken from his cell and roughed up by deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, several other deputies angered by the morning fracas launched a 
"search and destroy" mission against about two dozen inmates -- pulling them 
from their cells, beating and terrorizing them and scattering their belongings, 
according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle, who was the most seriously hurt in the melee, remains in a wheelchair 
from what his attorney said were injuries suffered when deputies hit him in the 
lower back and groin with a metal flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an absolute outrageous and despicable thing they did," said Carlyle's 
attorney, Richard Eiden, who called the settlement a significant admission by 
the county that deputies had overstepped their authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's every day that they pay out this kind of money for a 
beating. In that sense, it's a victory," Eiden said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is one of several over the last three years in which inmates have 
accused deputies at county-run jails of racial harassment and brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Two sheriff's deputies were fired last year for allegedly burning a cross in a 
Central Jail module where members of a black street gang were housed. Five 
white jailers were also reassigned last year for allegedly employing undue 
force against black gang inmates. 
</P>
<P>
In voting for the settlement on Monday, Claims Board Chairwoman Nancy Singer 
said the agreement made economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for settlement, she said, "would be the fact there may have been 
excessive force (used); there may have been some serious injuries." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that under federal law defendants must pay attorney fees if 
plaintiffs prevail in a civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Singer and other county officials said they could not recall any other county 
case that involved brutality allegations against deputies in the County Jail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, 13 black inmates and one Latino had sued the county, Sheriff 
Sherman Block and 25 deputies, claiming their civil rights were violated. Three 
deputies were later dismissed from the case and eight plaintiffs dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Carlyle and Rushing were tried and acquitted on misdemeanor assault charges 
stemming from the 1986 incidents. A similar charge against Jackson was 
dismissed before trial. The three other plaintiffs were Kevin M. Dunbar, Gerald 
Smith and David Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
The inmates contend in their lawsuit that there is "a custom, pattern and 
practice of racial discrimination, brutality and lying" by deputies at the Hall 
of Justice jail, where 1,800 inmates are held awaiting trial or finishing 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit said that the Sheriff's Department was aware that Deputies Forcier 
and Paul Orrin, in particular, had "vicious and racist propensities," but took 
no steps to retrain the officers. 
</P>
<P>
Orrin pleaded no contest in 1988 to auto theft and insurance fraud in a scheme 
to illegally ship cars to Mexico for sale, using the connections of a jail 
inmate. He has left the force. 
</P>
<P>
Forcier, who has denied using racial epithets or excessive force against 
inmates, now works at the Norwalk station. He could not be reached for comment.

BRADLEY WILL REFUSE RAISE IF IT'S TIED TO ETHICS REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley said Monday that he will not accept a pay raise if it is tied 
to an ethics reform package under consideration by the Los Angeles City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bradley would donate his $9,467 raise to charity, he said in a letter 
to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council is scheduled to take up the ethics and pay raise issues today for a 
final time before placing the measures on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of the ethics reforms have said privately that they believe 
linking the reforms with the pay raises may kill the reforms altogether because 
the public will vote down the pay raise. Under the proposal, council members 
would receive 40% pay raises, boosting their salaries to $86,157, and the mayor 
would get a 9.2% raise, making his salary $112,004. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge you to allow the voters to speak separately on these topics," 
Bradley said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley did not say whether he would turn down the pay raise if it is placed on 
a separate ballot measure and approved by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Through a flurry of amendments last month, the council altered a package of 
ethics proposals drawn up by a citizens commission appointed by Bradley one day 
after his narrow election victory last spring. 
</P>
<P>
The council killed a proposal on Jan. 19 to establish public financing of 
political campaigns, upsetting an agreement worked out between Councilman 
Michael Woo and Geoffrey Cowan, the head of Bradley's ethics commission. At the 
same time, council members approved a ballot measure giving themselves, the 
mayor, the city attorney and the controller pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
The commission had drawn up a broad ethics package that called for public 
financing, a ban on outside income for public officials and a prohibition on 
lobbying by public officials for a year after they leave office. Cowan said he 
would call for a citizens initiative if the council failed to pass an ethics 
package that included the commission's major proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Woo has spent the past three weeks working to put the compromise back together 
and, according to sources, has garnered enough council support to revive the 
public financing measure. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new compromise would put many of the Cowan commission's ethics 
reforms and a pay raise for council members together on the same ballot 
measure, according to sources. 
</P>
<P>
Linking the ethics and pay raise proposals is meant to be an incentive to win 
the votes of some council members who oppose public financing, the sources 
said.

AN ENGLISH-ONLY FRENZY IS SWEEPING THE PROVINCES, AND SOME SAY IT'S PROPELLED

THUNDER BAY, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Claudette Blier-Houle, the trouble started with a simple attempt to get a 
better education for her children. 
</P>
<P>
"I never anticipated such a negative response," Blier-Houle said recently. "I 
certainly didn't expect to precipitate a revolt." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Blier-Houle, an accountant, is embroiled in a bitter dispute 
between French- and English-speakers that is spreading across Canada. One 
commentator has called it "a cancer that leaps from one part of a ravaged body 
to another." 
</P>
<P>
Last night, the City Council of Thunder Bay voted to make English the city's 
only working language. The council's members arrived at this decision after 
hearing that Blier-Houle and a dozen other French-speaking parents were trying 
to set up special French-language classrooms in the city's public schools. The 
issue attracted a capacity crowd of hooting spectators to the council chambers. 
And a small, anti-bilingual picket line appeared in front of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The vote makes Thunder Bay, a city of 113,000 people in southwest Ontario, the 
largest in a series of the province's municipalities to declare themselves 
English-only. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven other municipal governments in Ontario have passed similar 
measures, and still more are scheduled to put the question to a vote. Most of 
the places involved are small, and the first votes caused little controversy. 
But now that larger places, like Thunder Bay, are weighing in, the English-only 
movement has set off a chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors as far away as New Brunswick, on the eastern seaboard, have begun 
talking about making their towns unilingual, and Indian politicians in Canada's 
far north are now questioning whether Canada's federal bilingual laws should 
apply to their native Canadian constituents. The English-only debate has become 
a regular feature on national newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
English-only activists say they have nothing against French-speakers but simply 
object to bad economics. They say Canada's bilingual road signs, duplicate 
government paper work and switchboard operators saying, "Good morning, 
bonjour," cost too much -- especially in places like Thunder Bay, where only a 
tiny minority speaks French. 
</P>
<P>
But few French-speaking Canadians believe that the English-only movement is 
inspired by fiscal conservatism alone. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is prejudice," Blier-Houle declared. 
</P>
<P>
The Francophones seem prepared to fight back. Shortly after the port city of 
Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, declared itself English-only, a government 
translator in the French-speaking city of Montreal put the following weather 
report on the national news wires: "Mainly sunny with racists . . . clouding 
over this afternoon . . . chance of flurries and of Nazis." The translator was 
suspended without pay. 
</P>
<P>
Canada has long had disputes over language, but the current one is brewing at a 
particularly inopportune time politically. Ottawa has been trying since 1982 to 
get all 10 of the country's provinces to ratify the national constitution. 
(Before 1981, Canada did not have a constitution; its charter was an act of the 
British Parliament dating from 1867.) In the early 1980s, the holdout province 
was French-speaking Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney oversaw the drafting of a set of 
constitutional amendments designed to bring Quebec on board. Canadians call 
these amendments collectively the Meech Lake Accord because they were drawn up 
at the resort of Meech Lake, Quebec. All provinces have until June to ratify 
it, or it will die. 
</P>
<P>
The package looked to be a shoo-in at first, but some have begun having second 
thoughts. One of the most frequently cited objections is a clause recognizing 
Quebec as a "distinct society" from the rest of Canada. The distinction has 
prompted Canadian women, Indians, immigrants and other social groups to wonder 
why they, too, cannot be considered "distinct" under the law. 
</P>
<P>
English-speaking provinces have begun to worry that the clause will give Quebec 
special rights above the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
It now seems unlikely that Canada will ratify the Meech Lake Accord by the June 
deadline. And some Canadians say that, if the provinces cannot agree on Meech 
Lake, the whole nation may crack apart. A poll taken for the newsmagazine 
Maclean's found that 40% of Canadians believe that Quebec may break off from 
the country sometime during the decade. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of these fears, Ontario's spate of English-only resolutions shows 
how fast and far the national barometer is falling. 
</P>
<P>
In Thunder Bay, for instance, the normally somnolent City Council chambers were 
filled to capacity for the English-only vote. Two members, both women, tried to 
explain to the crowd that the resolution was unnecessary -- Canada's federal 
language laws do not force municipalities to spend any money on French services 
-- but English-speakers muttered, clucked their tongues and finally began to 
boo. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of resolution makes us look like a hick town," one woman said. 
</P>
<P>
At this, one of the men present gave a shout and stormed from the room. 
</P>
<P>
Blier-Houle, the French-speaking mother whose lobbying had given the 
English-speakers their rallying point, said she was "completely surprised" by 
what happened at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Thunder Bay does not have any all-French public schools, and she had been 
sending her three children to a Roman Catholic school that taught them in 
French. But when her eldest son entered the eighth grade, she noticed that a 
good deal of class time was being devoted to confirmation classes. 
Blier-Houle's son was not planning to join the Catholic Church, so for him the 
catechism classes were a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
Blier-Houle says she first tried sending him to one of the French "immersion" 
programs run for English-speaking youngsters in Thunder Bay's public schools. 
But to her surprise, his ability to speak French deteriorated. It turned out, 
she said, that the English pupils were speaking English on the side during the 
immersion course. 
</P>
<P>
That was when Blier-Houle decided to press the school board to set aside 
French-only classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"How could it get so distorted?" she said. "I suspect it comes from the strong 
anti-Francophone sentiment in this country at the present." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Quebec has managed to ruffle the feathers of English-speaking Canada -- 
at a time, oddly, when long-standing French-Canadian tendencies toward 
separatism appeared to be peacefully dormant. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the 1960s and 1970s that Quebec's French-speakers had seemed 
likeliest to break off, in a form of independence called "sovereignty 
association." Radicals in Montreal even bombed mailboxes marked with the 
British crown, and the Quebec government emblazoned license plates in the 
province with the phrase "I remember" in French, meaning the province 
remembered war waged hundreds of years ago between French and English 
Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
The separatist movement was embodied in the Parti Quebecois, swept to political 
power in 1976 on a promise to let the province vote on independence. But when 
the vote was held in 1980, the public rejected independence decisively. Polls 
taken in the early 1980s showed that Quebecers had less and less interest in 
the issue. The Parti Quebecois was voted out of office in 1985, and it appeared 
that the separatist agenda would have to be shelved. 
</P>
<P>
But old antagonisms die hard. In 1988, Quebec annoyed English-speaking Canada 
anew by supporting a new bilateral trade agreement with the United States; the 
rest of the country vigorously opposed the pact. The trade agreement was 
finally signed in 1989. Since then, Canada's economy has begun to slow down, 
and English-speaking Canadians are fond of blaming the trade pact -- and 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Still more provocative, Quebec not long ago enacted a law banning 
English-language signs on its streets. Wary English-speakers figure that if 
Quebec will adopt French-only sign laws without the benefit of the Meech Lake 
Accord and its "distinct society" privileges, it might be capable of any number 
of divisive measures once the pact is ratified. 
</P>
<P>
In Thunder Bay, English-speakers referred to the sign law again and again as 
evidence of the need to put perceived French chauvinists in their place. 
</P>
<P>
"The French are afraid of losing their language and their culture through 
assimilation," said Bryant Webster, a mechanic who is president of Thunder 
Bay's Alliance to Preserve English in Canada, an advocacy group. "They want to 
totally isolate themselves from this society -- and they want the rest of us to 
fund that for them."

WINDS AND TIDES PUSH OIL ASHORE; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: POLLUTION IS WORST YET ON HUNTINGTON AND BOLSA CHICA BEACHES. EXTRA 
WORKERS ARE DEPLOYED.

<P>
Winds and tides worked in concert Monday to pushed bands of thick black crude 
oil onto Huntington and Bolsa Chica state beaches, producing the worst 
pollution yet from last week's 394,000-gallon spill off the Orange County 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmed by the onslaught of blackish goo that coated vast stretches of the 
state beaches north of the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier, officials rushed to 
deploy nearly 200 additional workers, increasing cleanup crews by a third. But 
many of the newly enlisted were in training or en route to the scene -- not on 
the shoreline where by mid-afternoon the slick was foiling the round-the-clock 
cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 80,000-ton tanker American Trader, with more than 19 million 
gallons of crude oil still aboard, returned Monday evening under its own power 
to Long Beach Harbor, anchoring just inside the breakwater. The two holes in 
its hull, apparently caused by its own anchor as it attempted to moor off 
Huntington Beach to unload oil for a mainland refinery, had been patched with 
plywood, foam and sheet metal. Coast Guard officials authorized the vessel's 
owners, American Trading Transportation Co., to move the tanker after an 
inspection of the hull found no traces of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel made the 11-mile trip to Long Beach in about three hours, escorted 
by the Coast Guard cutter Blackhawk, a state Department of Fish and Game boat 
and an oil-skimming vessel. A Coast Guard helicopter shadowed the 21-year-old 
tanker from above. The American Trader is expected to berth today, and crew 
members will unload its cargo of crude. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy flow of oil along the coast, an aerial inspection by state 
fish and game experts found no serious damage so far to any of the wildlife 
estuaries and marshlands along the coast. Even so, additional personnel were 
dispatched to bolster spill defenses at sensitive coastal points, including the 
Huntington Beach wetlands, where booms and an earthen dike have been breached 
twice by small amounts of tainted seawater in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the heaviest impact we've seen on the beaches," said U.S. Coast Guard 
Capt. Jim Card, the federal coordinator of the spill cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said one-third of the Alaskan crude still menaced the coast 
Monday night. Skimmers had picked up 29% of the spill and 43% had evaporated or 
naturally dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
As the oil washed ashore Monday, it created lethal conditions for wildlife. By 
late afternoon, 226 oil-soaked birds had been rescued, up from 99 the day 
before. Another 24 birds died, bringing the death toll to 72. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst day yet for wildlife," said Curt Taucher, a spokesman for the 
state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
A plea was issued for sheets, towels and sturdy boxes to be brought to the bird 
collection center at Magnolia Street and Pacific Coast Highway to clean and 
hold the the injured birds, including scoters, grebes and murres, all common 
shore birds. Many of the birds picked up oil sitting or feeding in the 
glistening 14-mile-long slick that was nearly 5 miles wide in some places 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, the Coast Guard reported Monday that drug tests on the tanker's 
captain, Robert La Ware, mooring pilot John Keon and the ship's second mate, 
who were on the bridge at the time of the accident, were negative. Earlier 
tests for alcohol also were negative. 
</P>
<P>
The weather -- an ally since the hull of the 800-foot tanker was apparently 
pierced by its own anchor, freeing nearly 9,400 barrels of Alaskan crude -- 
turned into the enemy on Monday. A blustery front approaching from the north 
and early morning high tides were a disastrous combination for the army of 
workers who had succeeded in keeping pace with the capricious slick. Some area 
beaches suffered their first daylong assault from the slick. 
</P>
<P>
. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like it finally made its mind up," said Huntington Beach Fire Captain 
Ray Picard. "What's left out there appears to be washing up in a big way." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials monitoring the slick said bands of tar and brownish foam 
20 to 30 feet wide and, in places, two inches thick washed ashore at Bolsa 
Chica State Beach north of Huntington Beach. The oily tides struck near the 
inland Bolsa Chica Wetlands, an ecological reserve that is home to the 
endangered California least tern as well as a temporary home to thousands of 
migratory birds and much marine life. But a wide stretch of beach and Pacific 
Coast Highway separates the saltwater marsh from the fouled coast. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller fingers of the slick, lurking just beyond the surfline most of the day, 
also marred portions of city and state beaches in Huntington Beach. Lifeguards 
reported thick balls of oil that resembled tar. 
</P>
<P>
Before dawn, fumes from the crude were so noxious that a dozen cleanup workers 
became ill with headaches and nausea, forcing state health officials to suspend 
the cleanup for several hours. No serious injuries were reported, however. 
</P>
<P>
After nightfall, battling falling temperatures and high winds, cleanup workers 
waged an almost futile effort to keep up with the oil hitting the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"We had this area here in great shape yesterday (Sunday)," a despondent Cecil 
Gore, a paid worker said. "Then it came ashore again." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, sightseers jammed Pacific Coast Highway near the Huntington 
Beach bluffs. Many of the gawkers, using binoculars and telescopes, peered down 
at the workers swabbing the sand in their smudged slickers. Others posed for 
pictures with the idle American Trader in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Angelo, a Connecticut tourist, brought her two sons to look at the mess. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of important for them to see it," she said. "I don't think they'll 
understand unless they can see it and smell it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, with heavy oil coming ashore, officials ordered more than 
nine miles of beach in Huntington Beach closed for a minimum of three weeks. 
Closure, they said, would aid cleanup and bird-rescue efforts. Sunset Beach 
also was placed off limits. 
</P>
<P>
In Seal Beach, a tiny town straddling the Orange and Los Angeles county line, 
officials also closed beaches, though no oil had reportedly come ashore. The 
beach was closed so that injured birds could take refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital importance to keep people off the beaches. The contaminated 
birds are frightened by the crowds on the beach and will not come ashore where 
they can be safely rescued," said biologist Esther Burkett of state Department 
of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor, Anaheim Bay, Huntington Harbour and the San Gabriel River 
remained closed to vessel traffic. 
</P>
<P>
At the Anaheim Bay wildlife refuge, Navy spokesman Robert Montgomery said 
workers were doubling the amount of boom material from about 3,500 feet to 
7,000 feet at the entrance to a wetland area, bracing for winds that could 
accompany the approaching cold front. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil would have to get by six sets of booms to get to the marsh, and we're 
confident that couldn't happen," Montgomery said. "If it did get all the way 
in, I really shudder to think about what would happen." 
</P>
<P>
By Monday night, officials estimated 110,000 gallons of oil was still floating 
off the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
Skimming efforts to remove the rest of the oil were threatened by an Alaskan 
cold front working its way down the coast. The front, officials said, could 
bring rough seas and force suspension of the skimming by at least 20 Navy, 
Coast Guard and private vessels. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum, owner of the spilled oil and the lead company in the cleanup 
effort, arranged for reinforcements to bolster the crew of 400 trained workers 
combing the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The weather has us very concerned," said Tom Thomson, a public affairs officer 
for British Petroleum. "We're getting hundreds of people out on the beach . . . 
and we're gearing up for whatever may come when this front hits." 
</P>
<P>
The additional crews were hired by Southwest VECO Inc., the company that 
supervised the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill last year. 
</P>
<P>
"BP wanted VECO involved in a lead role because of the oil that is coming on 
shore right now," said John Kerrigan, vice president and regional manager for 
VECO, a $1-billion-a-year corporation that is based in Anchorage but has a 
regional office in Long Beach. "That, plus the storm that's coming, could 
really make for a mess down on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
After word spread that more workers were needed, a line of people stretched 
around the block at VECO's Long Beach offices, asking for one of the 
$10-an-hour cleanup jobs. VECO gave workers crash courses in beach cleanup, 
outfitted them with protective gear and then dispatched them to the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Beach cleanup normally requires a 40-hour course, said Mac McKee, construction 
manager for the firm's Long Beach office. But because of the amount of oil 
washing up, workers were being sent out after a short, four-hour crash course. 
</P>
<P>
VECO said it was sending 130 cleanup workers to the affected area Monday 
afternoon, and hoped to send 75 more in time to work the night shift. By this 
morning, VECO expects to have about 450 to 500 workers on both daytime and 
nighttime shifts, a spokeswoman for the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum officials would not confirm those numbers but one spokesman 
said they were "in the ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, politicians and celebrities continued their barrage of press 
conferences on the oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush said he sees no connection between the oil spill 
from a tanker off Huntington Beach and environmental questions on offshore oil 
drilling. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who toured the fouled sand near the 
Huntington Beach pier Monday, said Bush is "not well informed" about offshore 
oil drilling if he does not see the link to tanker safety. Cranston said recent 
federal studies have reported that 
</P>
<P>
"the more drilling platforms you have the more tankers you will need." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he's concerned," Cranston said after flying over the spill in a 
helicopter. "But he's not concerned enough." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a group of politicians and celebrities organized by the 
American Oceans Campaign, a Los Angeles environmental group, held a seaside 
press conference in Huntington Beach to call for tougher legislation regarding 
oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
The group included actor James Garner, Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles) and state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp. They support new laws requiring tankers to be double-hulled and the 
creation of a superfund to pay for oil spill cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do something about the environment, the rest means nothing," 
Garner said. "We won't have any air, we won't have any water, we won't have any 
birds and we won't have any fish." 
</P>
<P>
One politician who has not visited the scene, Gov. George Deukmajian, was 
invited to by Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays.

WON'T CHANGE EUROPE TROOP PLAN, BUSH SAYS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush said Monday he will not revise his formula for a joint 
U.S.-Soviet military reduction in Europe even though the Soviets have rejected 
the idea because it would leave U.S. forces with an additional 30,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the geographical advantage the Soviet Union would have in 
redeploying units to Central and Eastern Europe west of Soviet borders, Bush 
said that "we've got a big ocean between us and . . . Western Europe" that 
would delay a speedy redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us think we can see with clairvoyance as to what's going 
to happen the day after tomorrow," Bush said at a press conference, defending 
his plan for maintaining U.S. forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The President proposed on Jan. 31 that the United States trim its 305,000 
troops in Europe to 195,000 in Central Europe, most in West Germany, with an 
additional 30,000 in the rest of Western Europe. The Soviets, by this plan, 
would trim their deployment of 380,000 in East Germany, Poland and 
Czechoslovakia to 195,000. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Soviet Union stated its readiness to withdraw all of its troops 
from Central Europe, many of them unilaterally, in an effort to accelerate the 
negotiations now under way on reducing conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin, in a statement, said it accepted Bush's 195,000 limit if the more 
than 30,000 American troops in Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey are 
included and if negotiations are scheduled to reduce the overall number. 
</P>
<P>
Bush on Monday, however, stood by his initial proposal and reacted coolly to 
Soviet suggestions that the troop limits could go well below the 195,000 level 
put forth by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"Our European allies want us there," Bush said. "I have a feeling that some of 
the Eastern Europeans want us there, because they know that the United States 
is there as a stabilizing factor, and we will be there for a long time to come, 
hopefully at significantly reduced numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that area of contention, the President offered a particularly upbeat 
assessment of the broad sweep of U.S.-Soviet relations after Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III's visit to Moscow last week. Bush said that work on treaties 
reducing conventional, strategic and chemical weapons can be "substantially 
complete" by the time Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives in the 
United States for a summit in June. But he said he was uncertain that the 
weapons treaties and a new pact limiting nuclear testing could be signed by 
then. 
</P>
<P>
And, even as he acknowledged that East and West Germany appeared "to be moving 
very fast" toward becoming one nation, he maintained that there was no room in 
Europe for a unified Germany that has divorced itself from the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization -- thus seeming to close the door on the prospects for the 
"neutral" Germany favored by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The President spoke at a time when the East-West relationship, in general, and 
the U.S.-Soviet relationship, in particular, are tumbling through dramatic 
changes, and his remarks reflected the almost daily assault on the Cold War 
that has left policy makers grasping to assess the changes and develop new 
positions to account for the emerging opportunities for democracy in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"If we continue this kind of momentum in our bilateral relationship with the 
Soviet Union, the June summit will be a major success," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, the President has offered conflicting views of the changing 
world, a reflection of the domestic political pressure on military spending at 
a time of nearly unalloyed optimism about the state of East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Bush carried out a controversial cross-country journey that offered 
daily backdrops of military operations straight from the peak of the Cold War 
and doses of still-tough presidential rhetoric as he pressed for approval of a 
$295-billion defense budget. On Monday, Bush spoke of the "extraordinary and 
positive week in East-West relations," a week in which the Central Committee of 
the Soviet Communist Party stunned many with large strides toward a pluralistic 
political system. 
</P>
<P>
But there remains the thorn presented by the prospect of a single, large, and 
presumably economically powerful Germany -- a nation from which two world wars 
emanated. 
</P>
<P>
Siding predictably with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bush said, "I think 
that Chancellor Kohl is absolutely correct, and we ought to support him: NATO 
membership. I think it's stabilizing. I think it's good." 
</P>
<P>
Would that mean the same sort of full membership in NATO that has made Bonn an 
integral element in the alliance? "Sure, yeah," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the concern of "many Europeans," that a unified Germany outside the 
bounds of NATO might pose a threat and could be dangerous, "would be allayed" 
if the nation's membership in NATO was maintained. 
</P>
<P>
However, on the central question that appears to be the greatest stumbling 
block -- that of the role of troops in a new unified Germany -- Bush said, 
"There might be some flexibility, obviously, on deployment of NATO forces." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, he said the deployment question deals with the role of Western 
forces in what is now East Germany. Officials have said in the past that these 
troops would remain in the western sector. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, Bush said his top priority when he meets on Thursday with the 
leaders of three major cocaine-producing nations in Cartagena, Colombia, will 
be to emphasize that his Administration is moving forward "on all fronts" to 
reduce the drug demand within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The message reflects Administration efforts to ease South American concerns 
that the aggressive new U.S. plans for a war on drugs in the Andean nations 
have failed adequately to address American responsibility for cocaine 
trafficking in the region. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Bush indicated that he did not plan to offer 
immediate new economic assistance to help those nations subsidize a shift away 
from the cocaine economy, warning that they "ought not to be condoning the 
growth of crops that are illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said he hopes to persuade the Colombian government to sign off on a 
plan that would deploy U.S. Navy ships to the Caribbean to monitor air and sea 
routes commonly used by smugglers bringing drugs northward from Colombia.

BUSH HAS NO PLAN TO LIFT SANCTIONS AGAINST S. AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration has no plans to lift U.S. sanctions against South 
Africa, President Bush indicated Monday, deflecting pressure from some 
conservatives who argue that the Pretoria government deserves a concrete reward 
for its racial policy reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bound by the law" to maintain the sanctions until the South African 
government meets additional conditions, Bush said in a press conference. 
Although he could ask Congress to change the law and repeal some or all of the 
sanctions, he showed no inclination to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we ought to give Mr. De Klerk certain credit," Bush said, referring to 
South African President Frederik W. de Klerk. The South African leader, Bush 
said, has proven that he is able to "look much more realistically about 
political change." 
</P>
<P>
But, when asked if he thinks he needs to make a "gesture" to De Klerk to 
respond to the release of activist Nelson R. Mandela, Bush said he believes his 
invitation to De Klerk and Mandela to visit Washington will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
Some Administration officials, as well as conservatives here and abroad, have 
advocated a rapid removal of at least some sanctions. Monday morning, for 
example, Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of state who oversees policy 
toward Africa, said the United States should "make some gesture" to reward De 
Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really care about is encouraging further progress," said Cohen. "If 
that means relaxation of sanctions, fine." 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent a letter to 
about two dozen world leaders advocating an end to international sanctions 
against the De Klerk government. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are doing the right thing as boldly and courageously as President 
De Klerk," Thatcher wrote, "it seems quite absurd to still use sticks to beat 
them with, however small those sticks may be." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Thatcher, who has long been the most outspoken Western leader in 
resisting sanctions against the South African regime, appears to be alone in 
her call. 
</P>
<P>
Bush in the past has opposed the sanctions, which were adopted over 
then-President Ronald Reagan's veto in 1986. He repeated that philosophical 
leaning Monday, saying, "Frankly, I think some (sanctions) are 
counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, Bush seems disinclined to back his philosophy with action, 
perhaps wary of the strong domestic opposition he would face. Democrats made 
opposition to South Africa a popular issue when Reagan vetoed the sanctions 
bill. An active campaign by Bush to remove sanctions would, at minimum, 
undermine the efforts his Administration has made to improve relations with 
black voters. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would consult on the issue with Mandela, who supports continued 
sanctions, when the black leader visits Washington. So far, no date has been 
scheduled for the visits of either Mandela or De Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
The President also seemed determined to minimize differences between Mandela 
and the United States. He brushed aside questions about Mandela's statements 
supporting continued armed struggle against the white minority-led government 
and praising the South African Communist Party, a long-time ally of Mandela's 
African National Congress in the anti-apartheid fight. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always advocated nonviolence," Bush said, but "I read (Mandela's) 
statement to be more on the defensive side" -- an advocacy of self-defense, 
rather than aggressive violence. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, in a press conference Monday in Johannesburg, defended in theory the 
use of force, saying "the armed struggle is a defensive act against apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
And on Sunday, in his first speech after his release from prison, Mandela had 
said, "I salute" the Communist Party for "its sterling contribution to the 
struggle for democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"The alliance between ourselves and the party remains as strong as it ever 
was," Mandela added. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, U.S. administrations have often raised concerns about ties between 
the Communists and the African National Congress, the principal guerrilla group 
in the struggle against apartheid. This time, however, Bush played down any 
such worry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these Communist parties are for the most part sliding down hill. 
What's coming uphill is democracy and freedom," he said. If Mandela pushes 
plans to nationalize privately held businesses, Bush said, "if we have a 
difference there, that's fine -- we'll discuss it with him." 
</P>
<P>
While Bush advocated maintaining the status quo on sanctions, several 
congressional Democrats on Monday pushed ahead with plans for bills that would 
strengthen the sanctions still further -- imposing what would amount to a 
virtual trade ban with South Africa. The move drew support from a spokeswoman 
for the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
"While we welcome Mandela's release with great concern, we note that 2,500 
political prisoners remain in jail," Lindiwe Mabuza, the ANC's U.S. 
representative, said at a Washington press conference. Until further changes 
are made in South African government policy, Mandela and other anti-apartheid 
activists cannot participate in political debate "without fears of arrest, 
detention, tear gas or clubs," she said.

LAWYERS BACK BILL TO RESTORE SCOPE OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Bar Assn. urged Congress on Monday to overturn five U.S. Supreme 
Court rulings last year that limited the scope of federal civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers' organization, meeting in Los Angeles, threw its weight behind 
legislation introduced last week by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that would 
rewrite the law so as to nullify the high court's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would permit employees who are victims of racial harassment to win 
damages from their employers and would force businesses to justify as necessary 
any hiring or promotion policy that tended to exclude minorities or women. 
</P>
<P>
The bar association vote in favor of the new civil rights initiative came 
despite pleas from business lawyers and a top official of the Bush 
Administration to hold off action. 
</P>
<P>
The association represents 365,000 attorneys nationwide, and its officials say 
they plan to lobby on behalf of the new civil rights legislation when the 
Senate begins hearings on the bill later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically the ABA has played a key role in the development of the civil 
rights laws, and it would have been a shame if the organization wasn't willing 
to go on record now," said Washington lawyer Sally Determan, who proposed the 
resolution approved Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The pending civil rights legislation may well spark a fight between the Bush 
Administration and congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Donald B. Ayer told the bar association gathering that the 
Administration will offer legislation to overturn two of the five rulings that 
deal with blatant discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush White House is "committed to strong remedies for intentional 
discrimination," Ayer said. But the Administration opposes overturning the 
other rulings, he said, because they deal with "quotas" in hiring and 
promotions. Ayer described the association's resolution and the Kennedy bill as 
a simplistic "wave of the hand" response to a complicated legal issue. 
</P>
<P>
But American Bar Assn. President-elect Jack Curtin, a Boston lawyer, said the 
issue was indeed simple. "Does the ABA want to make it easier or harder for 
victims of discrimination to gain relief?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the delegates voted by a 2-1 margin for a resolution calling for all 
five rulings to be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
The five court rulings came at the end of the 1989 Supreme Court term and were 
decided on 5-4 votes, with the court's conservative faction in the majority. 
They decided the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Black employees who are victims of racial harassment on the job may not sue 
for damages. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 gave blacks the same rights as whites 
to "make and enforce contracts" and allowed damage suits against violators of 
those rights. In Patterson vs. McLean Credit, the court said this law covered 
discrimination in hiring -- because that is akin to making a contract -- but 
not on-the-job discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
* Women and minorities must challenge an unfair change in a company's seniority 
policy within 300 days, even if the women have no way of knowing then that they 
will be hurt by it. The case was Lorance vs. AT&amp;T. Kennedy and the Bush 
Administration agree that this time limit should be relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
* White employees may challenge a court-approved affirmative action plan years 
after it was adopted. This decision in Martin vs. Wilks threatened to unravel 
hundreds of city and county plans to hire and promote more minorities. The 
Kennedy bill would forbid new lawsuits if the white employees knew about the 
plan when it was in the works and chose not to contest it then. 
</P>
<P>
* Employees must no longer prove the necessity of hiring or promotion policies 
that tend to harm minorities or women. In 1971, the high court put the burden 
of proof on employers if their job policies had a discriminatory impact. But 
last year's decision in Ward's Cove Packing Co. vs. Atonio essentially reversed 
that doctrine and put the burden of proof back on employees who say they were 
victims of discrimination. The Kennedy bill would return to the 1971 standard. 
</P>
<P>
* Managers may use racial or sexist reasons for denying an employee a promotion 
if they can furnish other legitimate reasons for their decision. The case was 
Price-Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. The Kennedy bill says the employer is guilty of 
illegal discrimination if race or sex was one reason for denying a promotion.

SHARON RESIGNS AT STORMY MEETING;

<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir walked out of a chaotic meeting of his 
Likud Party on Monday after a verbal brawl with hawkish rival Ariel Sharon, who 
surprised everyone by quitting his Cabinet post to protest developing peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Shamir sought a vote of confidence in his leadership while 
Sharon tried to drum up votes to block compromises in peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon demanded that the Palestinian uprising come to an end before talks begin 
and that the talks be barred to Palestinians expelled from Israel and Arab 
residents of East Jerusalem. Both men tried to have their way -- at the same 
time -- by shouting into microphones and calling for the party's 3,000 Central 
Committee members to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"You must confirm me in my work. That's my resolution to the Central 
Committee," the bantam-sized Shamir called out as he peered over the podium. 
Hands in the audience started going up. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is in favor of wiping out terror? I ask the committee," began the portly 
Sharon, leaning into his own mike. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, gathered in a Tel Aviv exhibition hall, roared. It was difficult to 
say just who was supporting whom, although Sharon supporters set off loud 
chants of "Arik! Arik!" -- Sharon's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"Please sit down," Shamir told Sharon. "Democracy will decide who has faith in 
me, who has confidence." 
</P>
<P>
"Who is in favor of excluding deportees? Raise your hands," commanded Sharon, 
who until Monday was minister of trade and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Ah, nonsense! Vote only on this resolution. . . !" yelled Shamir, thrusting a 
finger into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"Who is in favor of excluding East Jerusalem Arabs?" Sharon asked loudly. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was on its feet, booing and cheering all at once. Each contestant 
declared himself the winner. Shamir adjourned the meeting and trudged off the 
dais, circled by grim-faced security agents and trailed by a flock of his 
Cabinet ministers. Sharon's backers taunted the 74-year-old prime minister with 
hisses and calls of "Coward! Coward!" 
</P>
<P>
Sharon slapped down his memo pad, stayed on the speakers' platform and was 
joined by allies from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Did Shamir get a hands-up vote of confidence and end the meeting before 
Sharon's attack? Were the shouts in answer to Sharon's resolutions a defeat for 
the prime minister? It was like a bout the World Boxing Assn. might rule on. 
</P>
<P>
By offering his resignation, the 61-year-old Sharon shed responsibility for 
Cabinet decisions and can now focus on undermining Shamir's leadership in 
Likud, party observers said. Sharon himself hinted as much: "I decided to 
resign from the government to continue my struggle for reaching our national 
objectives, which are now endangered as a result of the government's policy." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a former defense minister who led Israel into the 1982 Lebanon war, 
claimed that he told Shamir of his resignation by letter Sunday. Shamir said he 
knew nothing about it until the meeting got under way, and there was no 
indication that he had accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting, called by Sharon and two other hawkish Cabinet ministers from the 
Likud Party, attracted wide attention because of its possible impact on efforts 
to arrange Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III has proposed a meeting with the 
foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt to work out a list of Palestinian 
participants. The chosen Palestinian panel and the Israelis would discuss 
Shamir's plan to hold elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
For the past seven months, the peace effort has stalled over which Palestinians 
will take part. Participation would either be limited to residents of the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip or would also include East Jerusalemites as 
well as Palestinians who have been expelled by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is wary that Palestinians-in-exile will front for the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, which is based in Tunisia. Many Israelis believe that 
if Jerusalem Arabs take part, the talks might throw into question the country's 
hold on its own capital. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, which kicked off the meeting, Sharon expressed a lack of 
confidence in Shamir. "Under your government," he said, turning toward the 
prime minister, "Palestinian terror runs wild within the land of Israel and 
causes heavy losses to innocent Jews and Arabs." Sharon made a pitch for a 
tougher crackdown on the uprising, as well as for Israel to keep all the 
occupied land. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers have killed 600 Palestinians during the intifada, or uprising. 
Another 160 Arabs died at the hands of Palestinians themselves, mainly on 
suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities. Forty Israelis have been 
killed by Palestinians in Israel and the disputed land. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, two terrorists shot up and threw grenades into a tourist bus in 
Egypt and killed nine Israelis on board. Israeli officials say the killers were 
Palestinians expelled from Israel during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
In a head-to-head battle with Sharon, Shamir appears to have the upper hand. 
Political experts had predicted a 2-to-1 victory by Shamir had the issue 
actually come to a vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens assured reporters that despite the dispute, the 
government will go on promoting a vote in the territories.

Faced with growing Muslim criticism that it is helping to drive Palestinians 
from their homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Soviet 
Union on Monday called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to condemn 
Israel's policy of settling Soviet Jewish immigrants there. 
</P>
<P>
It also took the unusual step of calling on the United States to speed 
processing of applications from Soviet Jews who want to go to America so that 
more will have an alternative to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yuli 
M. Vorontsov called Israel's practices "extremely serious" and said the Soviet 
Union hopes the Security Council will proceed with "the same degree of gravity" 
to take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Israel expects 50,000 to 100,000 Soviet Jews to arrive this year and up to 
750,000 in the next five or six years under Moscow's liberalized emigration 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir triggered widespread criticism last month 
when he said a "big Israel" is needed to accommodate the immigration wave. 
Aides tried to play down his remark, saying that he meant a "strong" Israel. 
But the term "big Israel" is commonly understood in that country to refer to 
the pre-1967 state plus the West Bank and Gaza Strip territories occupied after 
the 1967 Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how many Soviet Jews are actually settling in the occupied 
territories. Simcha Dinitz, chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, 
said that for the 10 months ending at the end of last month, only 63 of 12,673 
new immigrants had moved to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
However, independent checks suggest that several hundred Soviet emigres have 
settled in the largest Jewish towns in the disputed territories, which are home 
to about 1.7 million Palestinian Arabs and 70,000 Jews. Also, some of the most 
prominent Soviet Jewish emigres have settled in the West Bank and are urging 
other newcomers to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israel's immigration minister canceled a planned visit to Jewish 
settlements in the West Bank for fear of stirring up more controversy on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov conceded that Moscow has come under pressure from Arab countries, 
some of which have urged it to stop Jewish emigration. Others urge that the 
Kremlin slow down the process of its rapprochement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the 46-member Islamic Conference Organization accused both 
superpowers of helping drive Palestinians from their homes by their handling of 
the Soviet Jewish emigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov said that Moscow is not about to reverse itself on emigration policy. 
"From now on," he said, "any Soviet citizens who wish to leave the Soviet Union 
and resettle in other countries have ample opportunity to do so." 
</P>
<P>
"We've told our friends in Arab countries that our legislation will be in 
keeping with the legislation of their countries, too. They also have no 
restrictions and limitations regarding emigration and immigration, nor are we 
going to have any." 
</P>
<P>
It is up to Israel to reverse its settlement policy, Vorontsov said, calling it 
unlawful and a violation of the Geneva conventions. "We believe that in the 
context of Israel's policy now, it is undesirable for the United States to 
delay the process of accepting immigrants from the Soviet Union to the United 
States," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The liberalized Soviet emigration policy has created an enormous influx of 
applications to go to the United States from many ethnic groups here, and 
Soviet Jews no longer get the same kind of preferential treatment they once 
did. 
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov also conceded that widespread rumors here about impending 
anti-Semitic pogroms "prompt people to think about emigration even though 
otherwise they would never do that." He pledged that "no pogroms will be 
allowed" and condemned those, including Israel, whom he accused of spreading 
unfounded rumors. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow had been hoping that Washington would join it in an unusual joint 
statement condemning Israel's settlement policies during the visit here last 
week of U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III. However, Baker said such a 
move would be unhelpful, and the Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a protest on 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Washington has made clear its opposition to Israeli settlements, 
and Vorontsov said he does not believe that a Security Council resolution will 
pose "any insurmountable difficulties for the United States."

ONCE-BOOMING CARTAGENA HOPING BUSH VISIT WILL LURE BACK TOURISTS; 
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIA: LOCALS HOPE THAT DRUG SUMMIT WILL DISPEL THE CITY'S IMAGE AS A 
TERRORIST TRAP.

CARTAGENA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last fall, as a wave of narco-terrorism swept Colombia, this historic city of 
Spanish colonial stonework and sunny Caribbean beaches vanished from the 
international tourist map. The seasonal tide of American and Canadian travelers 
never came in, and Cartagena's main business withered in despair. 
</P>
<P>
Adalberto Jimenez, an English-speaking tourist guide, said recently that 
without foreign customers, he is having a hard time feeding his 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't getting enough to eat. They aren't getting nutritious food," said 
Jimenez, 58. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are in a complete recession," said Jim Buttgen, a Cartagena tour 
operator who specialized in catering to American cruise ship passengers. But 
Buttgen and other Cartagena businessmen are hoping that this week's visit by 
President Bush will help restore the interrupted flow of North American 
visitors and revive the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
According to Buttgen's optimistic scenario, international publicity for Bush's 
anti-drug summit here with three South American presidents on Thursday will 
focus favorable attention on a peaceful and beautiful Cartagena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best thing that ever happened to Cartagena," Buttgen said over lunch 
in a nearly empty restaurant. "We're going to get free advertising all over the 
world, and if things go well afterward, we'll just have to do a good 
follow-up." 
</P>
<P>
Buttgen and others here assume that Cartagena will prove a safe place for the 
summit. Until a dynamite bomb exploded on the sixth floor of the Hotel 
Cartagena Hilton late in September, the city seemed immune from the 
narco-terrorism and other violence that has plagued Colombia for years. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine traffickers were known to have invested heavily in apartment buildings 
in Bocagrande, a narrow peninsula on the east side of Cartagena that went 
high-rise in the 1980s. The city was believed to be a favored playground for 
the drug lords and off-limits for trafficking and killings. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1533, Cartagena de Indias once was the busiest port on the Spanish 
Main, serving as a transshipment point for goods from Spain and gold from South 
America. It was repeatedly attacked by buccaneers, including Francis Drake and 
John Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
Central Cartagena is still a walled citadel flanked by monumental stone forts. 
Inside the walls, colonial buildings with carved stone doorways and wooden 
balconies line the narrow streets and picturesque plazas. In nearby Bocagrande, 
the Hilton and other tourist hotels rise a few steps away from sandy beaches 
and the gentle waves of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Cartagena was enjoying a tourist boom despite violence elsewhere in 
Colombia. Canadians flocked in on charter jets, Americans poured off Caribbean 
cruise ships and increasing numbers of Europeans were coming by scheduled 
airline flights. 
</P>
<P>
For the 1989-1990 tourist season, which was to begin last September, the city 
had expected 45,000 tourists on charter planes from Canada and at least that 
many cruise ship passengers. 
</P>
<P>
In late August, after drug lords declared all-out war on Colombia's leaders 
land launched a terrorist bombing campaign, the U.S. State Department issued an 
advisory that included Cartagena for the first time in a "status orange" 
designation previously applied to other Colombian cities. "Travel only when 
essential and with rigorous precautions," the advisory warned. 
</P>
<P>
Caribbean cruise lines canceled all calls here. And when Canada's Foreign 
Ministry followed with a similar advisory in September, Canadian charter 
companies halted all Cartagena flights. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb at the Hilton exploded Sept. 25, killing two Colombian doctors who 
were attending a Latin American medical convention here. The blast demolished 
10 rooms in the hotel and shattered Cartagena's image of immunity from 
narco-terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, "the city was dead, dead -- you didn't see anyone," said Claudia 
Fadul, manager of the municipal agency for promoting tourism. "The saddest 
thing is that it was the Hilton. Had it been another hotel, it wouldn't have 
had such international impact." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the explosion at the Hilton, another bomb damaged the office of a 
government bank in another part of the city, injuring a watchman. A month 
later, a car bomb exploded in Bocagrande, injuring two people. And in early 
November, a bomb damaged a shopping center on the south side of the city but 
caused no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Cartagena has suffered no such terrorist attacks. The city has 
hosted a Miss Colombia beauty pageant, a conference of Colombian mayors and a 
heavy influx of holiday vacationers from other parts of Colombia, all without 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, Colombian cocaine traffickers called a truce in their war, and 
terrorist bombings stopped throughout the country. But Colombian marines have 
continued to operate a checkpoint on the only street entering Bocagrande, and 
police posted at tourist hotels search the baggage of all arriving guests. 
</P>
<P>
Hoteliers apologize for the precaution, emphasizing that the Hilton bombing was 
an isolated incident. Jorge Serna, manager of the Hilton, observed that 
Cartagena has less crime and terrorism than some European cities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically a safe place," he said. "We feel very picked upon when they put 
out a warning. Is there a warning to go to Spain? There's no warning for Spain. 
Is there a warning to go to England? There isn't. And there is bombing going on 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
A Colombian television commentator said recently that Colombian President 
Virgilio Barco Vargas will ask President Bush to lift the State Department 
warning for Cartagena when they meet at the summit here. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush has to see that this place is as safe as many places in 
Europe," Serna said, adding that television viewers around the world will get 
the same impression. 
</P>
<P>
According to a senior White House official in Washington, the U.S. Secret 
Service has considered the possibility that drug traffickers might try to 
attack Bush at Thursday's summit with shoulder-fired missiles. But a 
communique, purportedly signed by fugitive drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, denied 
that the traffickers had targeted Bush or possessed SAM-7 missiles to use 
against Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to stay only a few hours, and his visit is expected to be 
confined to the area of a well-protected Colombian naval base outside the city.

ANTI-ARMENIAN RIOTS ERUPT IN SOVIET REPUBLIC OF TADZHIKISTAN

Riots broke out in the capital of Tadzhikistan during protests Monday against 
the resettlement of ethnic Armenian refugees in the Soviet Asian republic, 
official sources said. 
</P>
<P>
One report said there were several deaths and dozens of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency said a state of emergency and a nighttime curfew 
have been imposed on the city of Dushanbe to quell "mass disorders and pogroms 
and acts of arson and looting." 
</P>
<P>
Musafar Madzhidov, correspondent for official radio and television in Dushanbe, 
said armored vehicles had been brought into the city center and that it was 
calm late Monday. He said an unknown number of people have been killed and more 
than 70 injured. 
</P>
<P>
Rioting erupted after two rallies in a 24-hour period over rumors that Armenian 
refugees from bloody ethnic strife in the Caucasus region were being given 
preference for new housing, Madzhidov said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the crowd shouted "Down with the Armenians!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians, a predominantly Christian people, have been involved for the last 
two years in a bloody dispute with primarily Muslim Azerbaijanis over control 
of the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan since Jan. 13, 
and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was forced to send thousands of soldiers 
into the area to impose control. 
</P>
<P>
But until Monday, there had been no reports that the trouble had spread to the 
predominantly Muslim republics of Soviet Central Asia such as Tadzhikistan. 
</P>
<P>
The Tadzhikistan Communist Party leader, Kakhar Makhkamov, appeared before a 
crowd that gathered Sunday outside party headquarters in Dushanbe and asked for 
24 hours to investigate the rumors, Madzhidov said. 
</P>
<P>
Another crowd gathered on Monday but ignored his report that all but one 
Armenian refugee already had left Dushanbe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
They pelted the party headquarters with stones, breaking all the windows, and 
then went on a rampage through shops located nearby, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police fired in the air to disperse the crowd, but the rioting continued until 
armored vehicles brought soldiers into the center of the city at about 10 p.m., 
when the curfew was imposed, Madzhidov said.

Thirty-five years after former President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed it -- 
and after U-2 spy planes and various spy satellites -- the "open skies" idea 
for sanctioned military overflights moved toward reality here Monday with the 
opening of a 23-nation conference of NATO and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"Agreement in principle" for the concept, in which each military alliance would 
send aircraft over the other's territory, was predicted by Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze before the conference ends in two weeks. A 
full-scale agreement on the confidence-building measure is expected before 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Open skies is potentially the most ambitious measure to build confidence ever 
undertaken," Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the conference's 
opening session. It is "an integral part of our vision of a new Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft would be equipped to take photographs with ordinary and infrared 
film and with radar. They would also collect other information, including dust 
samples that could indicate a nuclear test. Only electronic signals would be 
excluded. 
</P>
<P>
They would fly day or night, in all weather, U.S. officials said. The 
all-weather capability is important because Eastern Europe is covered by clouds 
80% of the year. Until recently, spy satellites could not penetrate clouds or 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The overflights could occur at "any time, any place" within the limits of 
safety, officials said. Satellites, in contrast, follow a highly predictable 
course and schedule. It is easy for new weapons and other secret equipment to 
be hidden when satellites pass over. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Soviet and East European surveillance aircraft would become a 
common sight over Western Europe, the United States and Canada, while American 
and West European airplanes would be equally common over the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The open skies treaty, which may later be extended to include the neutral 
nations of Europe, is not associated with any arms control treaty. But the 
information gathered under it should complement arms treaties and make smaller 
nations, particularly those without spy satellites, feel more confident about 
their security. 
</P>
<P>
While the continuing negotiations for radical cuts in conventional forces in 
Europe "are the primary means to codify strategic stability in the new Europe," 
Baker said, "open skies can and should become a key component of our efforts to 
increase predictability while also supporting stability." 
</P>
<P>
Nations will be able to see more clearly than ever before the actions and even 
the intent of others, including military exercises in which offensive tactics 
may be practiced, and thus reduce the risk of surprise attacks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, whose country rejected Eisenhower's proposal in 1955 as an 
attempt to spy, called for extending the principle to "open space and open 
seas." 
</P>
<P>
He warned that with increasing access to space technology, nations with "crazy" 
leaders or even private companies might place in orbit weapons "to endanger 
mankind." He urged that an "international space inspectorate" be created to 
monitor space activities. 
</P>
<P>
He also renewed Moscow's longstanding proposal for naval arms control. At 
least, he said, the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
should agree to confidence-building measures such as notice of naval maneuvers 
and troop transfers. 
</P>
<P>
The United States remains adamantly opposed to any naval arms talks, however, a 
senior U.S. official said. "This country is an island nation and needs to 
ensure free sea lanes," the official commented, noting that, by contrast, the 
Soviet Union is a land power. Any restrictions on navies are certain to limit 
the United States more than the Soviet Union, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The open skies idea, revived by President Bush last year, differs somewhat from 
Eisenhower's original proposal in that it would cover the two military 
alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The 1955 proposal involved only the United 
States and the Soviet Union.

RADAR LOST EXXON VALDEZ, OPERATOR SAYS

The Coast Guard radar operator who was on duty when the Exxon Valdez ran 
aground testified Monday that he never looked for the tanker on his radar 
screen before it ran aground and created the nation's biggest oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Blandford, testifying in the trial of former tanker captain Joseph 
Hazelwood on felony criminal mischief and other charges, said he came on duty 
40 minutes before the disaster. He said he was told by Gordon Taylor, the 
operator who preceded him, that the ship had gone out of radar range. 
</P>
<P>
Blandford said he heard nothing from Hazelwood and added, "I wasn't looking for 
him because he had been lost (from radar), and I had no reason to believe 
anything was happening other than what Mr. Taylor had told me." 
</P>
<P>
He said he went about straightening up papers, had coffee and did his chores 
without looking at the radar before he got a radio message. 
</P>
<P>
He said Hazelwood called to report the Exxon Valdez was "hard aground and 
leaking oil." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you respond immediately?" asked Assistant Dist. Atty. Brent Cole. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like forever," said the witness. "It took about a minute for me to 
figure out what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Blandford said he glanced at his radar screen and could see the marker 
indicating the troubled ship. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked him (Hazelwood), 'Are you about a mile north of Bligh Reef?' And he 
said yes," Blandford said. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, two seamen who took turns at the helm on the Exxon Valdez 
painted a chaotic picture of the minutes before the tanker went aground. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Claar told of being at the helm about 11:20 p.m. when Hazelwood ordered 
him to put the ship on automatic pilot. He said he followed the order and 
yielded the helm to Robert Kagan just before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Kagan said he knew the tanker was on automatic pilot when he took over and 
can't remember when the order came to go back to manual steering. He said he 
and the third mate, Gregory Cousins, were near the autopilot control and, "We 
both reached for it at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Then, he said, he heard three separate commands to go right, left and then 
right again. In the final seconds before grounding, he said, there was a 
command to turn hard left, and Cousins grabbed the wheel with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I started making the turn, and he grabbed the wheel and helped make it," Kagan 
said. "I think he was kind of panicking then. He was kind of excited." 
</P>
<P>
At last, Kagan said, he heard "a little rattle, bumping" and the ship was 
aground. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Hazelwood's orders after the grounding, Kagan said he can't be sure 
whether the captain was trying to move the ship off the rocks or stabilize it 
on the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't sure what he was doing," the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins took the stand briefly before court recessed and was to tell his 
version of the grounding today.

GIRL WOUNDED AT DISNEYLAND IMPROVES

Anaheim police said Monday they may never know who fired the shot Sunday that 
hit an 8-year-old Downey girl visiting Disneyland. But they said they believe 
the shot was fired in the air by someone outside the park. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nayeli Diana Placentia's condition was upgraded from guarded to 
fair. She is expected to be hospitalized several more days. 
</P>
<P>
"She's alert and awake," said Fran Tardiff, hospital spokeswoman at UC Irvine 
Medical Center in Orange. "She's doing real good. She's a good, quiet little 
girl and very cooperative, very pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Surgeons removed a medium-caliber bullet that embedded in the lower right 
portion of the child's back as she rode the Disneyland Railroad in the 
Fantasyland section of the Anaheim park. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said the angle of the bullet's trajectory 
shows it originated from the north to northwest, but investigators may never 
know exactly where it came from because of the heavy concentration of homes, 
hotels, motels and other businesses in that area. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we can't even hazard a guess where it came from," Hedgpeth said. 
"All we can say is that someone fired a gun into the air." 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland is bordered by several neighborhoods where both residents and police 
say guns are often fired into the air, especially during holidays. Hedgpeth 
said the bullets can travel as far as a mile before they return to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said the train carrying Nayeli and her parents, 
Jose and Carmen Ramirez, was pulling to a stop at the Videopolis train station 
about 6:08 p.m. Sunday when the youngster complained of a pain in her back. 
Disneyland officials rushed her to Western Medical Center in Anaheim, where 
doctors discovered she had been struck by a bullet. She was transferred 
immediately to the trauma center at UC Irvine Medical Center. Roth said park 
officials halted the Disneyland Railroad temporarily while they examined the 
rear car in which Nayeli had been riding. Officials found a bullet hole through 
the canvas roof. 
</P>
<P>
The ride was reopened the same evening, and the park continued normal 
operations, Roth said. He added that Disneyland has offered to help pay the 
girl's medical bills, which are partially covered by her family's insurance. 
"Obviously, we feel bad about their experience," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said the incident is the first time a park patron has been struck by an 
errant bullet, although there have been two homicides in Disneyland's 35-year 
history. A man was fatally stabbed during an argument in 1984, and another man 
was shot to death in the Disneyland parking lot in 1987.

A LONG HISTORY OF LONG COUNTS; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: MANY OF TYSON'S PAST OPPONENTS ARE TIMED BY A STOPWATCH AS BEING DOWN 
FOR MORE THAN 10 SECONDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Neither Mike Tyson, nor his adviser, Don King, should be surprised that James 
(Buster) Douglas was timed as being down for as long as 13.65 seconds in their 
heavyweight championship fight Sunday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
It has happened frequently over the years -- and in many Tyson fights. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, of course, knocked out Tyson in the 10th round. However, King claims 
that Tyson should be awarded a KO victory because Douglas stayed down for more 
than 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was only obliged to get up before referee Octavio Meyran's count of 
10, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
A review of some films at the Amateur Athletic Foundation, with the help of 
library director Wayne Wilson and a stopwatch, showed fighters are often on the 
floor for a longer period of time than the actual count. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Tyson's previous bouts with outclassed opponents are examples of this 
time discrepancy. Backed up by a stopwatch, here are some samplings: 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 25, 1985 -- The count was stopped on a beaten Robert Colay at eight, but 
he was down for 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 13, 1985 -- Eddie Richardson was counted out, but he was actually on the 
floor 12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 11, 1986 -- David Jaco beat the count, but was down for 12.3 seconds. He 
was then counted out later in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 16, 1986 -- Jesse Ferguson got up at the count of eight. However, the 
stopwatch counted him down for 10.3 seconds. He was eventually knocked out 
formally in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
March 10, 1986 -- Steve Zouski was predictably counted out in the third round. 
He had been out for some time, say 13.3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 6, 1986 -- Alfonso Ratliff was knocked out in two rounds by Tyson. But he 
got a reprieve earlier when he was up at the nine count, when he had actually 
been down for 11.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 22, 1986 -- Tyson won the WBC heavyweight title with a second-round 
knockout victory over Trevor Berbick in Las Vegas. The count was 10, but 
Berbick had been reclining for 14 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 10, 1990 -- In his loss to Douglas, Tyson, in the 10th, got up at the 
count of nine but was still counted out because he was in no condition to 
continue. NBC put a clock on Tyson and found he was down almost exactly as long 
as Douglas was in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
So Tyson, of all people, should be aware that the time his opponents spend on 
the floor is not synchronized with the actual count. 
</P>
<P>
More examples: 
</P>
<P>
June 18, 1941 -- Heavyweight champion Joe Louis knocked out Billy Conn in the 
13th round in a memorable bout. The count was 10, but Conn was on the floor for 
12.4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 27, 1950 -- Sugar Ray Robinson deposited one Jean Spock on the canvas, but 
Spock beat the count even though he was down for 10.62 seconds. Oh, well, he 
got knocked out anyway in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
June 10, 1948 -- In the third Tony Zale-Rocky Graziano fight, Graziano was 
counted out in the third round. He should have been, since he had been down for 
11.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
May 1, 1957 -- Sugar Ray Robinson regained the middleweight title for the 
fourth time by knocking out Gene Fullmer in the fifth round. Fullmer was really 
out, on the canvas for 11.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
June 20, 1960 -- After being knocked out by Ingemar Johansson in their first 
fight, Floyd Patterson avenged the defeat in the rematch. However, it took him 
longer to knock out Johansson than it should have. 
</P>
<P>
Johansson beat the count on the first knockdown, but he was actually down for 
10.3 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when he was counted out in the fifth round, he had been on the floor for 
more than 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 18, 1970 -- Bob Foster was eventually knocked out by heavyweight champion 
Joe Frazier. But he prolonged the ending by getting up at an eight count. He 
had been down, though, for 10.1 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 23, 1974 -- Alexis Arguello won the featherweight championship by knocking 
out Ruben Olivares in the 13th round. However, before he did, Olivares was up 
at the count of nine when he had been down for 11.85 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
And, when he was finally counted out, he was really out -- 14.3 seconds on the 
floor.

WHAT POWER DOES A BOSS REALLY HAVE?; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BEGINNING WITH KENESAW MOUNTAIN LANDIS, BASEBALL'S COMMISSIONERS HAVE 
DEALT WITH LABOR PROBLEMS IN THEIR OWN WAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Major League Agreement empowers the commissioner of baseball to take 
whatever actions he deems proper in the "best interests" of the game, and the 
seven men who have preceded Fay Vincent as commissioner have interpreted that 
phrase in different ways in dealing with labor disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have mediated disputes and stayed out of them. They have opened 
training camps closed by owners. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie Kuhn, whose term was marked by player strikes in 1969, '80 and '81, and 
the 1976 owners' lockout, sided with the players in their fight for improved 
pension rights in 1969, but he vocally backed the owners' push for free-agent 
compensation in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn was convinced that "compensation would help us maintain competitive 
balance in baseball," he wrote in his book, "Hardball: The Education of a 
Baseball Commissioner." Therefore, he added, "If their position was right for 
baseball, I thought it was my duty to support them and to take whatever 
criticism might come." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to unionize players began during the days of the National Commission, 
the three-man panel that ruled baseball from its genesis until 1921. Those 
efforts failed, but commissioners acted to help maintain labor peace. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, appointed the game's first commissioner in 1921 
in the wake of the notorious Black Sox scandal. Called a "players' 
commissioner," he made several players free agents when he felt owners had 
treated them unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
Under Albert B. (Happy) Chandler, players got a minimum wage of $5,000 in 1946 
and a pension system partially funded by a percentage of receipts from radio 
broadcasts and, later, telecasts of the World Series. The Players Association 
was born in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Still, management held the upper hand. Chandler recalled in a 1981 interview 
how he had dealt with potential union insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember once when I was commissioner, Pittsburgh players, who had been 
unionized, were threatening not to go out on the field," he told the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
"They debated until 30 minutes before game time. We told the players we (were) 
going to have a game. I was going to put on a uniform myself, if necessary, as 
were my assistants, John Demoisey, Hans Wagner and Frankie Frisch, plus a few 
players such as Rip Sewell. The players gave in. There was no trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler's successor, Ford Frick, resigned in 1965. A year later, Marvin 
Miller, an economist for the United Steelworkers of America, was named 
executive director of the Major League Players Assn. He immediately tried to 
improve player salaries and benefits and loosen the reserve clause that bound 
players to their clubs for their entire careers. 
</P>
<P>
Frick's successor, Gen. William (Spike) Eckert, was perceived by owners as not 
being strong enough to stand up to Miller. Eckert resigned under pressure in 
December, 1968, as players were gearing up for their first strike. 
</P>
<P>
Into the breach stepped Kuhn, an attorney with the law firm that represented 
the National League. As the commissioner pro tem, Kuhn ended an impasse by 
persuading Miller to go back to the bargaining table and convincing owners to 
yield on several key points in the pension dispute. A settlement was reached by 
the end of February and the season was not disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, who was elected to a seven-year term in August, 1969, faced another 
strike threat in 1972. This time, he stayed out of the talks and let the 
owners' Player Relations Committee deal with Miller and the players. Removing 
himself from the negotiations contributed toward creating Kuhn's public image 
of arrogance, which Miller emphasized repeatedly in his efforts to gain 
sympathy for the players' cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Kuhn did the most unproductive of all things," Miller said last week. "On the 
one hand, he wanted to present the face of the commissioner being above the 
battle: 'I am the lord high commissioner, the Gilbert and Sullivan 
commissioner.' (An allusion to the pompous Major General Stanley in the 
operetta "The Pirates of Penzance.") That somehow he was neutral, though he was 
paid, hired and later fired by the owners. And that he only had the interests 
of baseball with a capital B in mind, and he was really above the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"None of that was true and he knew it. When the chips were down and disputes 
began to erupt and people wrote things like, 'The strike would be over if only 
Bowie Kuhn were alive,' he'd say the commissioner doesn't have authority in 
labor relations. He tried to be all things and succeeded in being nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The 1976 lockout was initiated by owners to force the restructuring of the 
reserve system after arbitrator Peter Seitz's landmark ruling granted free 
agency to pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally. 
</P>
<P>
Camps were shut down on Feb. 23, then were ordered open by Kuhn on March 17 
because "the closed camps were no longer serving any purpose." Negotiations 
continued without Kuhn's intervention, and the season began as scheduled while 
the two sides reached an agreement that included provisions for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn was roundly criticized for doing little to end the 50-day strike of 1981, 
although, according to his accounts, he helped persuade the PRC to accept 
Miller's idea that teams that had lost free agents should be allowed to take 
compensation from a pool of players from both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
His power had been technically curbed in 1979 when the PRC became an entity 
that was -- at least nominally -- separate from commissioner and owners. But he 
contended in his book that he couldn't end the 1981 strike because, although he 
could direct the PRC to continue negotiating, "I had no power to direct a 
federally protected labor union to do anything . . . Had it been otherwise, 
there would have been no strike. No sensible person would have permitted the 
Players Association to strike over the compensation issue." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "The issue transcended compensation. But how, in an emotional 
setting, do you explain to a public deeply attached to the game and its 
continuity, that the commissioner had best let the players live with the 
responsibility for what they had done; that things would be better in the 
future if they learned now that there was a price to be paid; that future 
strikes might take short courses or not happen at all? I tried and found no 
answer. As a result, I took a fearful lashing from the press for allegedly 
doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan intervened, but American League President Lee 
MacPhail was the catalyst in reaching the settlement early on July 31. Kuhn 
lost much of the owners' support for his handling of the strike, and many teams 
were disgruntled with the split-season format that settled the division and 
league champions. 
</P>
<P>
Owners voted to dismiss him in November, 1982, but asked him to stay until 
August, 1983, then eventually settled on Peter Ueberroth as the new 
commissioner. But because Ueberroth could not sever his ties to the Los Angeles 
Olympic Organizing Committee until after the 1984 Summer Games, Kuhn remained 
in office until Oct. 1, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's term began with an umpires' strike. He initially declined to 
intercede on the basis that it was "the league presidents' business." He 
entered the fray as an arbitrator on Oct. 7, on the condition that umpires 
agree to work the World Series. He brought about a quick settlement, siding 
with the umpires in their fight for better pay. 
</P>
<P>
When he took office, Ueberroth said he intended to stay out of labor 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be items that the owners take to the bargaining table that I don't 
believe are in the best interest of baseball," he said. "There may be items 
that the players take to the table that I don't think are in the best interest 
of baseball. There may be items that both take to the table and agree on that 
are not in the best interest of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . So if the commissioner is to function as commissioner, he cannot take 
sides, as unhappy as owners might be about that position." 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that stance in 1984-85 negotiations, but, behind the scenes, he 
opposed the owners' plan to institute a salary cap and was credited with 
limiting the strike to one day. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, he might have hurt the owners more by allowing and encouraging them 
to exchange salary information, which led to almost no free-agent bidding and, 
eventually to arbitrators' decisions that owners had colluded to depress the 
free-agent market. Ueberroth insisted he was simply trying to find ways to 
improve the game's financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Ueberroth was kind of different," said Miller, who was a consultant to the 
players' association during the strike of 1985. "He insisted he was 
independent, but he wasn't; that he was above the battle. The owners paid him 
but he didn't need the job. 
</P>
<P>
"He proceeded to spend his first period in office telling me and Don Fehr 
(Miller's ultimate successor as executive director of the union) and the 
players' association that they were going to hear poverty claims (from owners) 
but they weren't poor. They kept two sets of books. But that didn't stop him in 
1985 (during contract negotiations) from saying the owners were poverty 
stricken." 
</P>
<P>
Bart Giamatti, Ueberroth's successor, was not involved in any contract 
negotiations during his brief term, which ended when he died of a heart attack 
last September. His hand-picked deputy, Vincent, inherited the current 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent has said he would like to help, and Miller said Vincent's involvement 
could be crucial to resolving the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Vincent, I have met, and I think he's a bright man," said Miller. "He does 
not spout the Bowie Kuhn line. He understands and admits he's an appointee of 
the owners. He'd like to be helpful in the negotiations, but he doesn't know if 
he'll be able to do it. But he doesn't pretend to have the answers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not encouraging in terms of having a sane, intelligent voice who could 
step in and have impact (and won't intervene). 
</P>
<P>
"He's waiting to be invited to step in. He's uncertain about what is the 
appropriate role for him."

JIM MURRAY: HE CAN'T SUBPOENA HIS CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Only one man has ever won the heavyweight championship of the world from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
He may be shortly joined by another. 
</P>
<P>
You should win heavyweight championships with left hooks, right crosses, hard 
jabs, fancy footwork. Mike Tyson is about to try to win one with a flurry of 
whereases, parties of the second part, stipulations, and in consideration 
whereofs. 
</P>
<P>
You ever think you'd live to see Mike Tyson needing a lawyer to win a fight for 
him? 
</P>
<P>
Max Schmelings win fights on one knee, not Mike Tysons. 
</P>
<P>
You think Joe Louis would, so to speak, go to court to get a knockout reversed? 
Picture Ali doing it, can you? 
</P>
<P>
It isn't as if the various boxing commissions in charge of the sport nowadays 
were serious people. These are a bunch of cutups who will write you a whole new 
division of boxing if the price is right and the check's good. This is a cast 
of characters who will install new wrinkles like cruiserweights, paperweights 
or super junior middleweights -- whatever you want to legitimize your 
television show as a "title" fight. Checkbook pugilism. 
</P>
<P>
These comedians have now told us that what they're going to do is throw out the 
results of last weekend's heavyweight title fight. They're going to tell the 
guy who got knocked out that he actually won. Even if they first have to bring 
him to. Match that around your better parlor magic tricks. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a bad trick. If it works, we next strip Gene Tunney posthumously of 
his 1927 heavyweight championship. While we're at it, we reverse the order of 
the 1985 World Series. That one, you will remember, clearly turned on an 
umpire's decision that subsequent replays showed to be a wrong one. It opened 
the floodgates and enabled the Kansas City Royals, down two games to three, 
trailing 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth with the bases empty and the Cardinals 
about to claim the world championship, to rally for two runs and a victory 
after the side should have been out. 
</P>
<P>
Don't you imagine there's been a Wimbledon or two that could be reversed on a 
technicality? Let the lawyers loose and we may yet lose World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing, it always seemed to me, had been most immune to this kind of tinkering. 
I mean, so Dempsey was helped back in the ring against Luis Firpo. So, he 
cold-cocked Jack Sharkey when Sharkey's head was turned to protest to the ref. 
You don't take it to the Supreme Court, you stage a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing always seemed to me to be the most atavistic of all sports. It traced 
back to the caveman days. You think the Cro-Magnon man could take his case to a 
higher court? "Protect yourself at all times" was boxing's motto, not, "Get me 
Caruso!" 
</P>
<P>
I'm kind of ashamed of Mike Tyson. I thought he would take his lumps like a man 
and not go crying to whiplash attorneys to get his title back for him. Mike 
always looked to me like a guy who was a throwback to the days when men were 
men and it was either him or the dinosaur. Mike always looked as if he were 
fighting for the right to drag you back to the cave and have you for dinner. I 
never figured Mike for a guy who even needed a referee, never mind a boxing 
commission and L. A. Law. 
</P>
<P>
We all just love legal nitpicking. They have taken law into the far reaches of 
Alice's Wonderland. Regaining the heavyweight championship for a fighter they 
have to revive first is duck soup for guys who can get a serial killer's knife 
back to him or get an America's Cup for a yacht that just lost four straight 
races by half a day. 
</P>
<P>
For all we know, Mike Tyson probably wasn't read his rights before he was 
knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing, it always seemed to me, was above this forest of rules and 
counter-rules that govern most other sports. The way you tell a winner of a 
boxing match, it always seemed to me, you took a look at both fighters in the 
last round. The one standing up was surely the winner. Next, you picked the one 
who was bleeding least or who looked less like something hanging off a French 
cathedral. I always thought you should judge by, Who would win this fight if it 
went on? The fine points of scoring bored me. I mean, how do you score a 
murder? 
</P>
<P>
When the Tyson-James Douglas fight ended the other night, the winner was not 
hard to pick out. In the first place he was upright. In the second place, his 
opponent could not see out of one eye, the count had just reached 11 and, if 
the referee had permitted the contest to continue, Mike Tyson wouldn't have 
needed a lawyer, he'd have needed a priest. 
</P>
<P>
So Buster Douglas got the benefit of a long count? He got up, didn't he? That's 
what you're supposed to do when the referee holds up nine fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Let's examine the original long count, Dempsey-Tunney 1927. The referee there 
-- properly -- did not begin the count (as the rules specified) until the 
fighter scoring the knockdown had repaired to the farthest neutral corner. 
</P>
<P>
That rule, as it happened, should have been called the Jack Dempsey Rule 
because it was put in precisely because Dempsey was notorious for standing over 
a fallen opponent (Jess Willard and Luis Firpo are two who come to mind) and 
slugging them again before they could get fully to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Dempsey went to a nearby (and not neutral) corner after flooring 
Tunney, referee Dave Barry shouted at him, "Neutral corner, Jack!" And Jack 
scowled, "I stay here!" Barry dragged him to a neutral corner before starting 
the count. 
</P>
<P>
What should Tunney have done? Crawled around on his hands and knees to find the 
knockdown timekeeper at the bell and say, "How much time do I have?" 
</P>
<P>
No. And neither should James (Buster) Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
If it is the intention of the boxing commissions simply to force a rematch, it 
is not laudable but at least logical. It would be a big mistake for Buster to 
risk his newly won title against anyone but Tyson. An Evander Holyfield fight 
he might lose -- at one-tenth the purse he could command for Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
If he's dumb enough to risk that, maybe they're right to take the title away 
from him. He can't be trusted with it. 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Tyson is a student of boxing history. Does he want to be the answer to 
the trivia question, "Who were the only two fighters to win the heavyweight 
championship from a prone position?" Does he want to show his grandkids a 
picture of himself stretched out on the floor with a purple mound where his eye 
used to be and say, "This is a picture of Grandpa winning the heavyweight 
championship fight in Tokyo in 1990"? 
</P>
<P>
I like the old-timers' way of handling defeat. When Dempsey lost to Tunney the 
first time and came home all beat up, and his wife, Estelle Taylor, asked him 
what happened, Jack said, "Honey, I forgot to duck." When Louis got knocked out 
by Rocky Marciano, he looked at the long faces of his supporters and said, 
"Hey, I knocked out lots of guys!" 
</P>
<P>
You just forgot to duck, Mike. And, hey! You knocked out lots of guys!

DODGERS SIGN EX-RANGER CORREA, WHO HASN'T PITCHED IN 2 1/2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Dodgers added another comeback player to their spring training picture 
Monday when they signed Edwin Correa, a former Texas Ranger top rookie pitcher, 
to a minor-league contract. 
</P>
<P>
Because of problems resulting from a stress fracture in his right shoulder, 
Correa has not pitched in more than two years, and, as a Seventh Day Adventist, 
does not pitch from sundown Friday until sundown Saturday, the period his 
church regards as the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
Correa is a right-hander who struck out 189 in 202 1/3 innings as a Ranger 
rookie in 1986, when he went 12-14 with a 4.23 earned-run average. But he has 
not thrown a big-league pitch since July 8, 1987, when he suffered the shoulder 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
After trying and failing to rehabilitate the shoulder, he underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on June 23, 1988, and finally returned to pitch for the 
Rangers' rookie league team in Port Charlotte, Fla., last summer. He was 
released this winter, but he impressed Dodger minor league officials in a 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
When camp opens, Correa, 23, will join two other new Dodger pitchers recovering 
from surgery. Jim Gott is rehabilitating an injured elbow, and Pat Perry is 
recovering from a sore shoulder. BILL PLASCHKE

BASEBALL TALKS GO ON, BUT SO DOES STALEMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent participated in the resumption of collective 
bargaining talks Monday, but the meeting in the New York offices of the owners' 
Player Relations Committee lasted only 45 minutes and, apparently, there was no 
change in management's revenue-sharing proposal or the plan to lock players out 
of spring training camps starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side would discuss the substance of the meeting, but Don Fehr, 
executive director of the Major League Players Assn., said logistical hurdles 
alone now preclude a Thursday opening and that the negotiations have 
represented "a colossal waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot to say," Fehr said. "It's my impression that the situation 
hasn't changed at all. It's my impression that we're where we were yesterday 
and the day before and the day before that. The players are resigned to what 
they think is the inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
Charles O'Connor, general counsel of the PRC, sounded equally pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason to believe this can be settled quickly, but I'm always 
optimistic when we're talking, and we'll be talking again tomorrow. The 
commissioner's instinct made him feel that he wanted to be part of the process. 
He's part of the process and he'll be part of the solution. I would 
characterize his role as the same as mine, full-time." 
</P>
<P>
Both O'Connor and Fehr seemed reluctant to talk Monday and it is believed that 
Vincent asked them to reduce the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying not to do any more damage to the patient," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's owners had met Friday and reaffirmed their support of the PRC's 
negotiating strategy, including a lockout beginning Thursday if the union did 
not agree to the concept of revenue sharing. Even so, there seemed to be a 
feeling that the PRC might be ready to withdraw some aspects of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the basis for that," Gene Orza, the union's general counsel, said 
Monday. "I don't know why people felt that way. The owners had said there would 
be no change in strategy, no change in plans. We couldn't avoid a (Thursday) 
lockout now even with an act of Congress. The players have no reservations and 
the clubs haven't sent any equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"The question isn't, 'Will there be a lockout?' The question is, 'How long?' 
We're trying to determine just how much of an intrusion (the owners') action 
has caused." 
</P>
<P>
Of Vincent's presence, Orza said: "It can't hurt, but don't think of him as a 
third party. He's an agent of management. Within ownership, he has a measure of 
moral suasion, but what actual and factual contribution he can make, 
considering none of us who have been at the table have produced any progress, 
is uncertain. These people are trying to re-invent the wheel at a time when the 
wheel has never run smoother." 
</P>
<P>
Major league players are not required to be in camp until Feb. 28. A lockout 
will prevent them from reporting voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not be a technical lockout, but it's a lockout nevertheless," said 
Fehr, alluding to Thursday's closing.

GAMES' PAY-PER-VIEW DETAILED; 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPICS: COST TO VIEWERS WILL BE BETWEEN $100 AND $150 FOR 600 HOURS OF 
COVERAGE WITHOUT COMMERCIALS IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Besides the 160 hours of coverage NBC has planned for free television during 
the 1992 Summer Olympics, another 600 -- without commercials -- will be 
available through pay-per-view on three separate channels, it was announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cost of the pay-per-view programming to viewers will be between $100 and $150. 
NBC said more research is needed before the actual pay-per-view fee can be set. 
The network is not planning to sell partial programming. 
</P>
<P>
The pay-per-view coverage will supplement events televised by NBC, although 
there will be some overlap -- but not in prime time. The pay-per-view block 
will be 12 hours and run from 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the West. Then at 2 p.m., the 
12-hour block will be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's cable partner is Cablevision Systems Inc. It is half-owned by NBC and is 
the parent company of SportsChannel America. 
</P>
<P>
But that does not mean pay-per-view programming will be carried on the 10 
SportsChannel regional networks. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not become a pay-per-view channel for the Olympics," said Rockey 
Flintermann, the director of programming for Sports- Channel Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a deal between Cablevision and NBC. I think they will deal directly 
with cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably play a role in the marketing and promoting of the 
pay-per-view telecasts, but I believe that will be the extent of our role." 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the pay-per-view package will be for those who want more Olympic 
coverage, or for those with a keen interest in a particular sport. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Lustgarten, Cablevision vice chairman, said: "We think it's a win-win 
situation. There has always been a flaw in network coverage of the Olympics: 
they could never show it all." 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the American television rights to the Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, 
with a bid of $401 million. Pay-per-view alone could generate $375 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rogers, president of NBC's cable operations, said 25 million homes should 
be ready for pay-per-view by 1992. Rogers estimates that 2.5 million households 
will buy the Olympic package. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Kulis, president of Choice Entertainment, a Southern California 
pay-per-view company, said: "That 2.5 million may prove to be a pipe dream. If 
it is, it will be a black eye for all of pay-per-view." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lustgarten: "We view the pay-per-view package as better than a seat in 
Barcelona. To be able to sit with your remote channel-changer and be in three 
venues is better than being there." 
</P>
<P>
Much of NBC's coverage will be taped because of the 10-hour time difference 
between Spain and Los Angeles. But the pay-per-view programming will be live. 
</P>
<P>
NBC was criticized in 1988 for what it selected to cover in Seoul, South Korea, 
and ABC was criticized in 1984 for the same thing at the Games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lustgarten said that even three pay-per-view channels will be overloaded by 
Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have too many events," he said. "When you look at the schedule, 
especially early on, it's possible that four channels wouldn't be enough."

DRIVER STILL CRITICAL, BUT COURSE WORKER IMPROVES AT DAYTONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Race driver Julius (Slick) Johnson remained hospitalized with critical injuries 
and course worker Mike Staley was improved Monday, as NASCAR officials 
attempted to piece together circumstances that led to the accidents in the ARCA 
200 stock car race. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 41, a part-time racer from Florence, S.C., is in intensive care at 
Halifax Medical Center, where he is on a respirator and receiving medication to 
maintain his blood pressure. He suffered a basal skull fracture and a crushed 
chest in an accident four laps from the end of the 80-lap race Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, in a chainreaction incident triggered by -- but not a part of -- 
Johnson's crash, Staley, 35, was tossed into the air like a rag doll when he 
was hit while trying to help a driver whose car had spun to a stop in the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
Staley, a lieutenant in the neighboring Port Orange Fire Dept., has been a 
member of Daytona International Raceway's emergency crew for 10 years. He is 
also in intensive care at Halifax after undergoing reconstructive surgery on 
his left forearm. 
</P>
<P>
"I was extremely pleased with the reconstructive surgery we performed on Mr. 
Staley's arm," said Dr. Albert Gillespie of the Halifax staff. "He is alert and 
is already on a rehabilitation program." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors also took X-rays of Staley's neck and spinal cord, which proved 
negative. He also suffered a small fracture of a bone in his leg which will 
require a brace for a short time. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's condition late Monday was "neither improved nor deteriorated," a 
hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Julius Johnson, who signs his ARCA license as Slick, was in the midst of a 
comeback after recovering from a serious crash in 1988 at Concord (N.C.) 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
He started in the 50th and last position Sunday in a backup car, a Pontiac 
Grand Prix, after his original car had been demolished in a crash during 
practice on Saturday. Johnson was not hurt in that accident. 
</P>
<P>
The 200-mile race for late model stock cars was the season opener for the 
Automobile Racing Club of America. It had already had six accidents, one of 
them involving 10 cars, when Johnson's car broke loose between the third and 
fourth turns and slid sideways into a pack of cars still closely bunched after 
a restart prompted by a caution period only a lap earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Videotapes show Johnson's car was hit first by David Simko's car, which spun 
him up into the outside wall and then down into the path of a second car. As 
Johnson's Pontiac slowed to a near stop, it was rammed on the driver's side by 
a third car. 
</P>
<P>
Seven cars were scattered along the track in the chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The 95 car (of Johnson) lost it in (turns) three and four, got down on the 
apron and shot back up the track," said Simko, of Clarkston, Mich. "There was 
so much smoke everywhere, I didn't know where to go. I was in the wrong place 
at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
That brought out the caution flag and pace car driver Elmo Langley prepared to 
pick up the leader, Jimmy Horton, of Hammonton, N.J., who won the race under 
the caution flag three laps later. During a caution period, laps are run at 
about 65 m.p.h., compared to the 180 m.p.h. at which the cars had been running 
under the green flag. 
</P>
<P>
When caution lights went on and the pack had passed the accident scene, 
emergency crews made their way to the disabled racers. 
</P>
<P>
Staley rushed to the side of Kevin Gundaker's car, which had stopped in the 
infield grass. He was talking with Gundaker when the second part of the 
accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Keselowski, the defending ARCA Permatex champion from Rochester Hills, 
Mich., was in the middle of another closely packed group, well behind the 
leaders, who had slowed down, when his Chevrolet apparently was tapped from 
behind. That sent him spinning toward Gundaker's car and when he slammed into 
the side of the stopped car, the impact knocked Staley eight feet into the air. 
He landed 25 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
Keselowski's car, still ricocheting after hitting Gundaker's, then rolled 
partially over Staley. That apparently was how he suffered his left arm 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars didn't slow down as much as ARCA would have liked them to," said Bob 
Loga, competition director for the Midwestern racing organization. "They were 
on the caution but didn't look like it." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Staley were air-lifted to the medical center by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Keselowski and Gundaker, of Maryland Heights, Mo., were also hospitalized 
briefly. Keselowski was treated for an injured leg, and Gundaker was X-rayed 
after complaining of back pains. They were released Sunday evening.

Southwest Conference Commissioner Fred Jacoby denied a protest by Texas, which 
asked that 14 seconds of its Feb. 4 overtime loss to Arkansas be replayed. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was based on officials failing to call a technical foul on Arkansas 
Coach Nolan Richardson, who walked off the court with Texas ahead, 86-83, with 
14 seconds left in regulation.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
THIS LUKAS HORSE ENDS UP SHINING BRIGHT

<P>
When the entries came out for Monday's $80,925 Santa Ysabel Stakes, Seaside 
Attraction was conspicuous by her absence. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-year-old filly was impressive in an allowance race a couple of weeks 
earlier and the restricted Santa Ysabel seemed the logical next step for her. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Wayne Lukas chose instead to wait for the Las Virgenes Feb. 24, but 
that didn't stop Santa Anita's leading trainer from winning his fifth stakes 
race of the 38-day-old meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bright Candles, who isn't generally regarded as one of the best sophomore 
fillies in Lukas' barn, rallied for the second time in the race and beat Heaven 
for Bid by three-quarters of a length in 1:45 3/5 for the mile and a sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
A $675,000 yearling, Bright Candles, a daughter of El Gran Senor, is obviously 
improving. Previously, she had lost by a head to Fit to Scout in the 
seven-furlong Santa Ynez. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she hadn't come close in two previous two-turn efforts, being beaten by 
a total of 21 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
The 3-1 second choice Monday, she appeared to have been put away by Heaven for 
Bid approaching the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"She was in awfully tight (on the far turn)," said Gary Stevens, who won three 
times in padding his lead in the jockeys' standings. "It was just good race 
riding (by Pat Valenzuela on Heaven for Bid). My filly may have been a little 
intimidated down in there. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't seem to want to go through. When Heaven for Bid kicked it in gear 
and got a length on my filly, the leader relaxed and dropped down. She'd been 
trying to get out and it surprised me when she dropped down. I was afraid I 
might clip heels, so I checked and went outside. 
</P>
<P>
"She showed she's a pro and when she got outside and we hit the quarter pole, 
she re-broke. I felt all along I had a lot of horse under me. It surprised me 
when she didn't go through on the rail. When she got outside, she made the move 
I thought she had in her. 
</P>
<P>
"She may have been getting a little late again today, but they will do that 
when you get them stopped and ask them to make two runs." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Stute, trainer of the runner-up, who was trying a distance race for the 
first time, thought she might have had an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"She might have pulled up when she saw the starting gate," he said. "Pat said 
she kept looking and looking and looking." 
</P>
<P>
Annual Reunion, the 3-2 favorite, was third, beaten by slightly more than two 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"She hesitates running inside," said Gary Boulanger. "She doesn't like the dirt 
hitting her. I tried to save ground, but she wouldn't punch it down there, so I 
got her out in the clear, but by then it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who flopped at even-money in the San Antonio Handicap, will be 
back to try again in the Santa Anita Handicap March 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't figure it out," said trainer Jerry Fanning. "I really thought he would 
run a good race and he never ran a jump. He looked like he was laboring all the 
way. He seemed fine this morning. You just have to throw it out." 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who won stakes all over the country last year, never looked as 
if he was going to be a factor in the San Antonio. Some knowledgeable observers 
didn't like the way he looked going to the gate, then he lugged out in the 
clubhouse turn. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type, who won his fourth consecutive race in the San Antonio, will be 
supplemented to the Big 'Cap for $25,000, along with Lively One, the San 
Pasqual runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Martial Law, who scored a shocking upset in last year's Big 'Cap, was the 
second supplementary entry to win the race. The other was Prince Dantan in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Carols Tri Crown, the 9-5 favorite in Monday's fourth race, reared as the gates 
opened and never joined the race. 
</P>
<P>
Not until several minutes after the race was official did most of the 15,000 
know what had happened to the filly. The stewards correctly termed her an 
official starter, but they should have posted the inquiry sign immediately and 
the announcement about her status should have been made long before the race 
was made official. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens also won with Rictorious and Ali's Song Monday and now holds a 
50-42 lead over Chris McCarron in the jockey standings. He also has a 
meeting-high seven stakes victories. . . . Wayne Lukas, who also won the 
seventh with Santa Tecla, said Steinlen will make his 1990 debut in the Arcadia 
Handicap March 4. He also said Land Rush will start in the San Rafael March 3 
and that Stella Madrid and Del Mar Debutante winner Rue De Palm are back in 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Black and McCarron each had two winners Monday. . . . There will be a 
Pick Six carryover of more than $98,000 when racing resumes Wednesday. . . . 
Joe Garcia, Laz Barrera's longtime assistant, quit Monday morning and will go 
out on his own.

POSTPONED YACHTING REGATTA WILL BE SAILED THIS WEEKEND

<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern California Yachting Assn.'s 61st edition of the Midwinter Regatta, 
the largest winter regatta in North America, was one of several sailing events 
postponed last weekend because of the oil spill off Huntington Beach. The 
regatta has been rescheduled for this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Two clubs in Newport Beach, Balboa and Bahia Corinthian, were forced to 
postpone their scheduled ocean races when the harbor entrance was closed off by 
oil booms to prevent the oil entering the harbor. Both clubs rescheduled for 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard also ordered all ocean races out of the Long Beach area 
canceled on Sunday when the oil slick neared that area. Clubs affected were 
Long Beach Yacht Club, Seal Beach Yacht Club, Alamitos Bay Yacht Club and 
Little Ships Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Races inside the harbors of Newport Beach and Alamitos Bay were sailed as 
scheduled. ALMON LOCKABEY

NEWSWIRE: A'S CANSECO SETTLES FOR $2-MILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jose Canseco agreed Monday to a one-year, $2-million contract with the Oakland 
Athletics, a $400,000 raise over last season but well shy of the huge totals 
other superstars have received this winter. 
</P>
<P>
The right fielder was scheduled to have an arbitration hearing on Wednesday. He 
wanted $2.2 million and the A's offered $1.6 million, same as last season. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Mike Gallego also avoided arbitration by agreeing to a two-year, 
$1,065,000 contract. He'll get $475,000 this year, $540,000 in 1991 and a 
$50,000 signing bonus. Mark McGwire, whose hearing is set for Friday, is the 
only player left on the A's arbitration list.

THE PREPS: HIGH SCHOOLS NEED TO SHOW MERCY ON WEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of last Wednesday's controversial girls' basketball game 
between Inglewood Morningside and South Torrance, questions remain unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Many fingers were pointed at Morningside Coach Frank Scott, who allowed Lisa 
Leslie, his All-American center, to score 101 points in a half. 
</P>
<P>
There was sympathy for South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez, who removed his team 
from the game at halftime, trailing, 102-24, and for his team, which had begun 
the game with seven players but finished with four because two fouled out and 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Many supported South Torrance's decision not to take the floor to begin the 
second half, preventing Leslie from breaking Cheryl Miller's eight-year-old 
national record of 105 points. 
</P>
<P>
When South Torrance school officials abided by Southern Section rules and 
suspended Ramirez from coaching the last game of the season, many people still 
said that Ramirez had done the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to find backers for Morningside, even though the Monarchs 
could probably win nearly every Ocean League game by a similar margin. But 
Morningside was, in a way, a victim of the unwritten code of high school 
athletics that says a superior team just cannot play its best against a weaker 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section even changed its position last Friday morning when it 
reinstated Ramirez and allowed him to coach the Spartans' last game, saying 
that he had just cause to forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
With Ramirez on the bench, the inspired South Torrance team went on to lose to 
North Torrance by only 10 points, 60-50. Morningside, the defending state 
champion in Division I, went back to its normal ways, defeating Compton 
Centennial, 78-44. 
</P>
<P>
So, what was gained from last week's activities? Did the Morningside team learn 
a lesson in sportsmanship? Did the South Torrance team? No one can truly answer 
those questions. 
</P>
<P>
But if the Southern Section would like to see the situation not repeated, it 
should simply establish a mercy rule, as it has done in eight-man football, 
under which a team ahead by a certain margin is awarded the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the Morningside-South Torrance game for example, with a 50-point mercy rule, 
the game would have been over early in the second quarter. No tears, no 
finger-pointing and no records broken. 
</P>
<P>
Having a mercy rule would be more logical than expecting a team not to play its 
best. In individual sports, such as track and field, it is not expected that a 
runner will slow down in every race against inferior opponents. Nor is that the 
case in tennis, swimming or wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
The City basketball playoffs will begin Friday with Manual Arts as the 
top-seeded team in the boys' 4-A Division. The Toilers, who lost to Crenshaw in 
the City final last season and again in the State Division I semifinals, won 
two close Western League games last week, beating Westchester and Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
"We have paid our dues this season," Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said. 
"We have played a tough schedule and we won our conference, but I don't 
necessary like us being the top seed." 
</P>
<P>
The Toilers, who won the state Division I title in 1988, are 21-3 this season 
and the Times' top-rated team in the City. However, in finishing conference 
play undefeated, they needed late heroics from senior forward William Celestine 
in both their 74-73 victory over Westchester and their 64-63 double-overtime 
victory over Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson calls the 6-foot-5 Celestine, who is one of only three seniors on the 
team, the most underrated player in the City. Celestine is averaging 19 points 
and 12 rebounds a game. He is joined by the senior backcourt tandem of 6-2 
guard Marcell Capers, who is averaging 14 points and 11 assists a game, and 
Cedric Jones, a 5-7 three-point specialist. 
</P>
<P>
When asked to predict a final four for the City semifinals at the Sports Arena 
Feb. 23, Simpson said he expects Manual Arts to meet Dorsey, which routed 
Crenshaw last Friday, 91-67, and Crenshaw to play Fairfax. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Charles Levy of Lynwood, who was regarded as one of the top players 
in Southern California last season, said Monday that he will attend Arizona 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-2 Levy said that he chose Arizona over Colorado and Washington because 
the Wildcats had recruited him as a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Fischer of Huntington Beach Edison upped her own Southern Section 
records for three-point field goals for a career (100) and season (92) and tied 
her game record by making 10 of the long shots in the Chargers' 88-83 victory 
over Westminster last week. She had 49 points in the game. . . . According to 
Volleyball Monthly, UCLA is expected to sign three high school All-American 
girls Wednesday, the first official day of the letter-of-intent signing period, 
in Amy Boyer of Poway, Irene Renteria of Las Vegas Clark and Allison Randick of 
Moraga Campolindo.

ASPEN FUR BAN PLAN GOES TO THE VOTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
A record voter turnout is possible in the swanky ski town of Aspen today for a 
referendum on proposals to ban the sale of fur and cut the size of a proposed 
$80-million hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Strickland, deputy city clerk, said she expects the two issues to draw 
out a large majority of the resort's 3,739 registered voters. If approved, the 
fur ban pushed by Mayor Bill Stirling would prohibit the sale of wild-animal 
furs, which would shut down the town's four fur-clothing stores. Opponents of 
the proposed Ritz-Carlton Hotel at the foot of Aspen Mountain want the 292-room 
hotel cut in size by one-third.

<P>
SECURITIES: AS THE JUNK BOND MARKET WORSENS, FEWER COMPANIES WANT TO DO 
BUSINESS WITH THE STRUGGLING INVESTMENT FIRM. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was only a week ago that the battle-scarred investment firm of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert released its 1989 earnings with a self-congratulatory 
commentary. The firm's relatively small $40-million loss was "a tribute to the 
professionalism of our staff and the loyalty of our clients," the once mighty 
firm said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Much has changed in a week. As the junk bond market has continued to fall, 
Drexel has confronted a cash crisis that prompted the firm to announce Monday 
that it was seeking a merger partner or an investor to shore it up. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, there were reports that some Wall Street firms were unwilling to 
trade securities with the firm, for fear that they would not be paid for what 
Drexel bought. 
</P>
<P>
And while Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph and other officials at the 
firm have insisted that it is still strong, many on Wall Street are predicting 
that Drexel may find no partners and that one of the investment world's most 
dramatic success stories might end. "I would describe them as in extremis," 
said one investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel officials declined to elaborate on how the crisis had unfolded. But 
sources said the company had been unable to "roll over" some of the short-term 
borrowings called commercial paper, as lenders apparently balked at extending 
new loans. Drexel has about $200 million outstanding in commercial paper, which 
is typically a source of funds for buying an inventory of securities and 
keeping them overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the major underlying cause of the crisis was the continued fall of the 
junk bond market. Prices of the average junk bond have fallen about 20% in the 
past year, and the crisis has recently raised new anxieties about the solvency 
of life insurance companies and their pension plans as well as savings and 
loans and other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
As bond prices have fallen, so has the value of a huge inventory of junk that 
is one of Drexel's principal assets. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street officials said the unwillingness of some firms to do business with 
Drexel was a dire sign. "We don't know how deep the firm's problems are, but 
whatever they are, this will escalate them," said Michael Lipper, president of 
Lipper Analytical Services, a research firm. 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, there were reports that more than a dozen dealers in 
mortgage-backed securities had put out the word that they would not trade with 
the firm through the so-called interdealer brokers. As the afternoon wore on, 
traders in other types of securities were pulling back from trades with Drexel 
as well, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say we're pulling back, because nobody wants to be blamed for 
starting a panic," said an official of one brokerage firm. "But nobody knows 
what's going on with Drexel, and nobody wants to take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
Drexel still has substantial assets that might attract the eye of some 
potential buyer. The firm remains the single biggest factor in the junk market, 
with more than 40% of underwritings in 1989; it is also an important factor in 
the mortgage-backed securities market. 
</P>
<P>
As the firm noted Monday, it has $800 million in equity capital, down from a 
peak of $1.4 billion in 1986. And though its work force has declined to less 
than 5,400 from a peak of 11,000, Drexel still has much of the financial talent 
that made its reputation during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Some on Wall Street speculated that Monday's announcement might arouse interest 
among a foreign buyer -- perhaps an investment bank -- looking for the 
important contacts that an acquisition might bring. Some held out hope that 
Drexel's lenders would come up with new loans or that some other innovative 
arrangement would be devised to help the 152-year-old firm survive. 
</P>
<P>
But others were skeptical that the firm would find many bidders among domestic 
or foreign buyers, in large part because of the potential liabilities that the 
firm faces from civil suits that may arise from the alleged securities 
violations of Michael Milken, the firm's departed junk bond chief, or other 
employees. Federal prosecutors are expected soon to bring a superseding 
indictment against Milken, who has denied all wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the potential legal liabilities of Drexel, the fact that its main 
business is losing money and their stigma . . . I don't think many people would 
be interested in buying them," said Doyle Lyons, analyst with Merrill Lynch in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Another Wall Street executive was more blunt about the level of interest in the 
company. "There's no line forming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback for any buyer is that the best employees might soon be hired 
away by other and stronger firms. 
</P>
<P>
If Drexel filed for bankruptcy court reorganization, among the biggest losers 
would be Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian concern that is Drexel's largest 
single shareholder, with a 25% stake. Also hurt would be the senior Drexel 
employees who hold almost all the rest of the company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
But while such a step might also further shake the junk bond market, observers 
say it obviously would not have the widespread effects on the market that it 
would have had in the mid-1980s, when Drexel was a far more dominant force in 
underwriting and trading the securities. 
</P>
<P>
The network of junk bond issuers and investors that Milken assembled in the 
early 1980s has long since adjusted to a world without Milken. 
</P>
<P>
"If growing companies want to issue junk bonds to raise capital, you can bet 
there will be other firms that will be more than glad to do it for them," said 
John C. Coffee, securities law specialist at Columbia University Law School.

FIRM'S TROUBLES SEND JUNK BOND MARKET INTO TAILSPIN;

TRADING: THE $200-BILLION MARKET FELL ABOUT 3% IN OVERALL VALUE FROM THE 
OPENING FRIDAY TO MONDAY'S CLOSE, WITH MAJOR ISSUES FALLING AS MUCH AS 5%. 
</P>

Junk bonds, which have been living up to their name during the past six months, 
took another pummeling Monday after beleaguered Drexel Burnham Lambert 
disclosed that it is seeking investors or a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Drexel news, traders said, another disclosure hurting the 
market was Friday's scrapping of a $1.25-billion junk bond sale by the market's 
biggest issuer, RJR Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, traders said, the $200-billion junk bond market fell some 3% in 
overall market value from the beginning of Friday through the end of Monday's 
trading, with major issues falling as much as 5%. That comes on top of declines 
of as much as 20% to 40% in junk bond portfolios during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, major issues typically dropped 2 to 3 points, which means they fell 
$20 to $30 for every $1,000 in face value. As an example, an RJR Nabisco 15% 
bond maturing in 2001 fell 3 points to 67 1/8, while another RJR 13 1/2% bond 
maturing in 2001 closed at 88, down 1 3/8. RJR junk bonds are considered a good 
indicator of the direction of the overall market. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said junk bond prices would have been hammered even more, except that 
there were so few buyers that some of the riskiest issues didn't trade at all. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are risky debt securities issued by corporations that pay investors 
a high yield to compensate for their gamble. Drexel has long been the leading 
underwriter and trader of junk bonds, so Monday's disclosure that the 
investment banking house is seeking investors or a merger partner because of 
its deteriorating financial condition is particularly ominous to the overall 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds became best known during the takeover boom of the 1980s when they 
were partly used to finance takeovers by corporate raiders such as New York 
financier Ronald O. Perelman, who bought Revlon, and Toronto businessman Robert 
Campeau, who bought the Allied and Federated retailing chains. Much of the 
market was developed by Drexel and its former junk bond chief, Michael Milken, 
who is currently facing felony charges for alleged securities violations. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1989, however, junk bonds have tumbled in value. Investors have 
turned skittish in the wake of financial problems at such major issuers as 
Allied and Federated as well as casino operator Resorts International. In 
addition, new federal laws require savings and loans to sell their junk bonds 
by 1994, and investors fear widespread selling by insurance companies as well. 
General fears of a recession also are contributing to the decline. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the junk bond market was hit hard early amid rumors that Drexel 
might even have to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which Drexel later denied. 
</P>
<P>
But traders said a more real fear for them is that many junk bond issues won't 
be refinanced if Drexel's problems continue. That would mean bondholders could 
be facing unpredictable risks such as financial restructurings or bankruptcy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond investors said they fear news of Drexel's problems will spark even 
more widespread selling. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to get out of the way. It's the worst of the herd mentality," said 
Ronald Vannuki, managing director of Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
One problem traders face is that the junk bond market is not very liquid, 
meaning that, unlike stocks of major companies, holders of some issues have 
difficulty finding buyers. Some issues hardly moved in price, traders said, 
because no one wanted to buy them.

More Thrifts Meet Capital Standards: The Office of Thrift Supervision said that 
about 18% more savings institutions are meeting the new, tougher federal 
capital standards than initially expected, the result of thrifts' efforts to 
raise capital by selling assets. Of the 836 thrifts originally expected not to 
meet the standards, plus another 25 institutions termed "subpar," 147 are in 
compliance, the agency said. So far, 541 thrifts have filed capital recovery 
plans.

FCC CHIEF SAYS CABLE TV MAY BECOME RE-REGULATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said at a Los 
Angeles hearing on the cable television industry that some re-regulation of 
cable is likely unless the monopoly position of system operators in most 
markets is ended. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks, during a break in the daylong proceedings at City Hall, came amid 
speculation that the commission will ask Congress to curtail cable operators' 
freedom to set prices or will otherwise seek to limit industry practices when 
it files a long-expected report on deregulation in July. 
</P>
<P>
"If the monopoly (in local service areas) persists, there'll be more regulation 
than there is today, yes," Sikes told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
At Monday's session, more than two dozen witnesses from cable companies, film 
studios, broadcast stations and local governments gave sharply conflicting 
views of the cable industry's practices since it was largely deregulated under 
a 1984 federal law. 
</P>
<P>
City officials from Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Thousand Oaks and Oakland said 
they faced a rising chorus of consumer complaints about higher prices and poor 
service. 
</P>
<P>
"Lincoln freed the slaves. We would like you to free us from the gouging cable 
TV companies," Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell Salter said in recounting his city's 
long-running disputes with Century Communications, which operates the only 
cable system in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Several cable officials, however, said deregulation had led to an explosion in 
program services such as Cable News Network, the ESPN sports network and the 
Discovery Channel and that such programming could be destroyed by 
re-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable has done more (for black audiences) than broadcast has been able to do 
in over 20 years," said Robert Johnson, president of Black Entertainment 
Television, a network formed with financial support from Denver-based 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the commission is considering proposals to subject more systems to 
rate regulation by widening the legal definition of competition in cable. 
Currently, cities are permitted to regulate local cable rates only when their 
areas receive fewer than three broadcast TV signals. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, FCC Chairman Sikes repeatedly queried witnesses about the likely 
viability of a second cable system, or of so-called wireless alternatives to 
cable in various areas. 
</P>
<P>
Wireless cable uses microwave bands to distribute programming to homes and is 
operating in some cities, including Cleveland. But wireless operators complain 
that they are denied access to programs that are routinely available to cable 
franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
George Ring, chairman of Cross Country Telecommunications, said his company is 
launching such a system to serve a 2,800-square-mile area largely in San 
Bernardino County. But "we are being denied equal access to programming," Ring 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
While the Los Angeles hearing was supposed to focus on program supply to cable 
companies, no clear consensus emerged among witnesses from big studios and 
independent production companies as to what measures, if any, authorities 
should take to contend with the increased "vertical integration" of companies 
such as TCI and Time Warner Inc. Those companies own both cable systems and 
interests in production units. 
</P>
<P>
Several independent Hollywood producers -- those whose companies are not owned 
by major studios -- argued that cable operators should be barred by law from 
owning an interest in programs, much as big broadcasters such as CBS, ABC and 
NBC are barred from owning an interest in the shows they produce. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy Carsey, whose Carsey-Werner Co. produces "The Cosby Show" and "Roseanne" 
for NBC, said her company has been unwilling to produce shows for cable TV 
because cable networks insist on owning the syndication and other rights to the 
programs, rather than leaving the producer free to profit from them after a 
first showing on cable. 
</P>
<P>
"Cable is a closed business. You do it their way creatively or financially, or 
don't come at all," Carsey said of her attempts to produce for cable. 
</P>
<P>
At least some of the commission's four members, however, appeared skeptical of 
the claims that program diversity would be served by making it easier for 
Hollywood to produce for the medium. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Bleier, a Warner Bros. TV official, strongly argued that cable 
re-regulation would damage what he called an "adolescent" industry. Since Time 
Inc. bought Warner Communications Inc. last summer, the resulting company has 
owned not only the nation's second-largest cable operation but also the Warner 
Bros. studio and the HBO pay TV service. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by the commission, however, MCA Inc. general counsel Robert 
Hadl complained that his company's recent films, including "Born on the Fourth 
of July" and "Back to the Future, Part II," may not be seen on pay TV at all 
because Time Warner's HBO unit was "not interested in buying" from MCA since 
the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for HBO and for Warner Bros. declined to comment.

SAFEWAY TO GO PUBLIC AGAIN TO FUND GROWTH

Safeway Stores, which went private in 1986 to avoid a takeover by the 
father-and-son raider team of Herbert and Robert Haft, said Monday that it 
plans to sell stock to the public again to raise as much as $160 million to 
build and remodel stores. 
</P>
<P>
The big Oakland-based supermarket operator announced plans to offer 10 million 
new shares, or nearly 10% of the company, at $13 to $16 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. At the same time, the 1,100-store chain reported robust 
improvements in 1989 operating earnings that analysts agreed should make the 
company attractive to investors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very cautious price," Brian E. Suher, an analyst with the Black &amp; 
Co. investment house in Portland, Ore., said of the anticipated initial share 
value. "I can't see how they won't be wildly successful with (the offering)." 
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed by Safeway with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, neither Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which owns 70% of 
Safeway shares, nor members of Safeway's management, who hold 10%, are selling 
any common stock in the offering. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's cashing out on this," said analyst Jonathan H. Ziegler with Sutro 
&amp; Co. in San Francisco. Rather, he said, the company wants "to figure out 
what they're worth" by having the market set a value. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers said they were puzzled by the timing of the offering in a period 
of great market volatility. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they could easily have done (the offering) at two times this price 
if this had not been a hard market," Suher said. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of stock would bring Safeway full circle from late 1986, when it 
converted to private ownership in a $4.3-billion deal arranged by KKR, a 
specialist in leveraged buyouts. Often in such deals, assets of the purchased 
company are sold to reduce the heavy debt taken on to cover the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
In Safeway's case, more than 1,000 stores were sold, reducing sales to $14.3 
billion last year from $20.3 billion and slashing 60,000 employees from the 
payroll. (Most of those workers were retained by the companies that bought the 
stores.) 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds of about $2.3 billion were used to pay off part of the company's $5.8 
billion in debt, which now stands at $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
With its debt under control, Safeway said Monday that it wants to concentrate 
on improving and building stores. It announced an ambitious $3.2-billion 
capital spending plan for the years 1990 to 1994, double the amount spent in 
the previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
In its prospectus, it said it plans to open about 70 new stores and remodel 
about 240 stores over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts, who have been expecting a Safeway public offering for two years, have 
praised the company's efforts to pare its debt and improve operations by adding 
high-profit salad bars, seafood shops and bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended Dec. 30, the company said its operating profits grew 42% to 
$463 million. However, net income shrank to $2.5 million from $31.2 million in 
1988, dragged down by a one-time $46-million tax charge. Moreover, the 1988 
figure was aided by an after-tax gain of $48 million associated with the sale 
of assets.

Hilton Weighs Buyout Offers: Hilton Hotels Corp. said it is evaluating a number 
of acquisition proposals but would not identify the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Hilton began to publicly welcome buyout offers. The Beverly 
Hills-based firm would not comment on a report that it may soon receive a bid 
from a group led by NWA Inc. Chairman Alfred A. Checchi. Hilton's board has 
reviewed some proposals, but the company said it is still willing to consider 
new buyout offers.

CEOS UNEASY ABOUT JAPANESE INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

America's top executives feel less comfortable with Japanese investment in the 
United States than with Canadian, British or European involvement in the U.S. 
economy, and they believe that Japan is not open to foreign investment, 
according to a survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board survey of more than 400 chief executives of the nation's 
largest corporations is believed to be the first attempt to measure how top 
U.S. business leaders feel about Japanese investment in the United States. Its 
findings are in line with recent nationwide polls that reveal Americans 
increasingly perceive Japan as a formidable economic competitor. 
</P>
<P>
The survey on "Japanese Business and Investment Practices" showed that more 
than two-thirds of the top executives believe that continuing Japanese 
acquisitions will increase friction between the the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Most attributed the criticism and discomfort over Japanese investment to the 
recent acquisitions of traditional American institutions, such as Rockefeller 
Center and Columbia Pictures, and to "a degree of cultural bias." 
</P>
<P>
In responding to questions on their views about U.S. investments from five 
specific countries, 73.1% of the CEOs felt most comfortable with investment 
from Canada, 62.0% from United Kingdom, 52.5% from the Netherlands, 50.1% from 
Germany, 37.5% from Japan and 31.9% from Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"Latest survey results reflect growing concern among U.S. business leaders over 
Japanese-U.S. relations," said Preston Townley, president and chief executive 
of the Conference Board. "The free-market tradition is strong in the U.S., but 
the feeling is now widespread that Japan and some of this country's other major 
trading partners clearly play by different rules." 
</P>
<P>
Although 9 of 10 of the chief executives said foreign capital can move freely 
into the United States, they said it is extremely difficult for foreigners to 
invest in Japanese companies. Although there "was considerable irritation with 
Japan's barriers to investments by foreigners," 57% of the respondents said 
that Japanese investment patterns overseas are not much different from those of 
American firms when the dollar was strong. 
</P>
<P>
While the majority said that Japanese investment helps to bring advanced 
technologies and better quality control to the United States, they also 
expressed concern that Japanese purchases of U.S. firms provides them too much 
access to American technology. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a nonprofit, New York-based business research group, said 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic newspaper, helped in the 
preparation of its survey questionnaire. It was the third of the Conference 
Board's series of chief executive surveys on issues of critical importance to 
business. 
</P>
<P>
American executives also had mixed views on other Japanese management and 
business practices. Most endorsed the Japanese policy of commitment to teamwork 
and the group over the individual. However, they rejected the practice of a 
worker spending his entire work life at one firm with promotions and raises 
based primarily on seniority rather than merit. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the chief executives said it was appropriate for governments to 
grant loans and subsidies to assist key industries in maintaining a high level 
of technology. But they rejected, by a large margin, the Japanese practice of 
companies holding stock in other firms to promote one another's management 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
A majority said they liked the fact that Japanese companies did not have to 
worry about hostile takeovers, and 90% endorsed the principle of primary focus 
on long-term corporate strategies rather than short-term performance. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the 400 company executives responding to the survey have annual 
sales volume of more than $1 billion. About 49% of total respondents were 
engaged in manufacturing; 18% finance, insurance and real estate; 13% business 
services and communications; 6% wholesale and retail trade, and 15% other, 
according to Fabian Linden, director of the Conference Board's consumer 
research center.

MARKETING: PREVENTION CHALLENGES MEDIA BUYING CREDO BY TARGETING AGE GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes breakthrough ideas in advertising come from the least likely places. 
</P>
<P>
But who could have predicted that a brand-new concept for selling advertising 
space in magazines would come from Prevention, a health magazine little known 
for marketing innovations? 
</P>
<P>
The idea is very simple. Prevention, which is a Rodale Press magazine published 
in Emmaus, Pa., has begun to tell advertisers that they can place ads in issues 
that are received only by subscribers who are 55 years old and under -- or 55 
and over. 
</P>
<P>
That might not sound so earthshaking. After all, many magazines have attracted 
advertisers for years by running their ads only in editions sent to 
"professionals" or mailed to particularly desirable ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
But several top media buyers and advertising researchers say age as a 
demographic category -- and other new forms of reader segmentation -- could 
eventually turn the print media-buying industry on its head. In fact, some say, 
this may mark just the beginning of a new round of magazines trying to segment 
their readership to advertisers as never before. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably start a trend," said Marian Confer, vice president of 
research at the New York-based Magazine Publishers Assn. "I think it's very 
smart. Advertisers will like it because they're not paying for readers they 
don't care to reach." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree that advertisers could go for this. "We're looking at the '90s as 
the age of re-segmenting for everyone," said Pat Keating, senior vice president 
and director of planning at Los Angeles-based Western International Media, one 
of the nation's largest media-buying services. "Any time a publication can find 
a niche like this, they make themselves a more viable product." 
</P>
<P>
Prevention is about the size of Readers Digest. Its articles are mostly about 
natural ways to prevent illness, like how to reduce your cholesterol level or 
how to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention has a circulation of about 3 million, primarily women in their 40s 
to 60s. The problem is, not very many women in their 20s and early 30s read the 
magazine. As a result, the magazine has continued to have trouble attracting 
certain big-name advertisers. Sure, it has some major advertisers like Kellogg 
Co. and Nabisco Brands, but there's next to nothing from some of the world's 
biggest advertisers like Procter &amp; Gamble and General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
This has frustrated the magazine's publisher, Sanford T. Beldon, to no end. So 
he got an idea about a year ago, and the results will begin to be seen in 
Prevention's March issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting at my desk, for the umpteenth time, reading a report about how 
yet another product didn't want Prevention because our readers were too old," 
said Beldon. That's when he got this idea: Sell advertisers separate editions 
for subscribers over and under age 55. 
</P>
<P>
That way, if advertisers just want to reach the 2.2 million subscribers who are 
under 55, they can do so without paying for the 800,000 who are over 55. 
</P>
<P>
That information, he says, can be easily gleaned from sources like voter 
registration rolls and the Department of Motor Vehicles (except in California, 
which restricts access to such data). The magazine also hires firms with 
expertise in finding out this kind of information. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, those with doubts about segmenting subscribers according 
to age. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, people of any chronological age can fall into just about any 
mind-set age," said Bob Warrens, senior vice president and media research 
director at the Chicago office of the J. Walter Thompson agency. "Age is not 
usually a good way to segment people." 
</P>
<P>
Because the latest issue of Prevention isn't on the stands yet, Beldon won't 
discuss which advertisers bought ads directed at the two age segments. But he 
said several did. And he projects that his magazine will sell an extra 40 
advertising pages this year because of this demographic segmentation. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he predicts, 20% of the magazine's ads in 1991 will come from this 
new system. Prevention may even offer some advertisers the option of buying ads 
in issues sent specifically to readers who have told the magazine that they are 
most concerned with things like diet, allergies or arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Even the competition is impressed. "This is a very viable idea," said Ann 
Okerstrom-Lang, associate national sales manager at American Health magazine. 
"I think everyone in this business is entering a whole new world of creative 
marketing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mid-Sized L.A. Ad Firm to Shut Down After 17 Years 
</P>
<P>
Another Los Angeles advertising agency is calling it quits. Abert Newhoff &amp; 
Burr, a 7--year-old firm that lost several major clients in recent months, 
confirmed late Monday that it will close within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult being a mid-sized agency," said Tom Burr, the agency's 
chairman. "It may be easier to be very small or very large. When you're in the 
middle, you're competing with both ends." 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which employs 32 people and posted annual billings of about $20 
million, was at one time regarded as one of the "hot" Los Angeles ad shops. But 
over the past two years, the agency lost several major clients, including 
Daihatsu American Inc., a Japanese auto account that it counted upon heavily. 
And several other clients, including Irvine Co. and Yamaha Consumer Products, 
recently cut way back on their ad budgets. 
</P>
<P>
All three of the firm's founding partners are undecided about what they will do 
next, Burr said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an agency that showed great potential," said James K. Agnew, executive 
vice president at the Los Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson. "But just as 
they seemed to reach critical mass, they fell back." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Century 21 at the Plate With New Ad Campaign 
</P>
<P>
Very few people move as often as professional baseball players. And few 
baseball players have played for as many teams as has the California Angels' 
veteran pitcher, Bert Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
That combination gave Century 21's ad agency the brainstorm for its newest 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In the spot, created by McCann-Erickson/Los Angeles, Blyleven discusses how 
often he has been traded -- and forced to suddenly sell his home. After all, he 
has played for the Minnesota Twins (twice), Texas Rangers, Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Cleveland Indians and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
With as many moves as he has made, Blyleven says in the spot, he can't be 
worrying about selling his home. As he walks back into the team clubhouse, 
Angels manager Doug Rader taps him on the shoulder and tells Blyleven that he 
has to speak with him. The implication is that Blyleven, who still has one more 
season on his contract with the Angels, is about to be traded again. 
</P>
<P>
Then Blyleven, always known as a joker, reaches into his locker and pulls out a 
familiar Century 21 "For Sale" sign. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Blyleven said he has used Century 21 to sell "several" of his 
homes in the past. But he has no plans to sell his current residence in the 
Villa Park area of Orange County -- even if the upcoming baseball season is 
canceled as a result of squabbles between owners and players. Explained 
Blyleven: "The home's paid for." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Agency Takes On a Great Big Assignment 
</P>
<P>
At first, it might sound unlikely: a tiny Los Angeles agency creating ads aimed 
at making villages throughout Africa self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, 2-year-old Marketing/And was handed the estimated $10-million 
account of the Akron, Ohio-based Global Energy Society. Funded by public and 
private donations, the group is overseeing a project called "Africa 1000," 
hoping to provide water and power to 1,000 African villages within five years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to make Africa self-sufficient," said Ralph Lee, who co-founded 
the agency with partner Paul Brooks. "We are trying to make the world aware of 
this project," said Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Global Energy believes that it can make many African villages self-sufficient 
by installing windmills that can pump water from the ground and irrigate crops. 
They also install solar panels to meet energy needs. This can be done at a cost 
of $40,000 per village. 
</P>
<P>
The print ads, which will be placed mostly in newspapers, will probably appear 
in June. But with plenty of problems right here in Southern California, why 
should local residents think globally? Said Lee: "We have to always extend our 
resources internationally, regardless of the problems here."

DREXEL DRILLED DEEPER HOLE BY INVESTING IN OIL REFINER; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: A $65-MILLION LOAN GAVE THE FIRM CONTROLLING INTEREST IN PARAMOUNT 
PETROLEUM. NOW THE OIL COMPANY HAS DECLARED BANKRUPTCY.

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has admitted financial troubles of its own, 
also finds itself a victim of the rough-and-tumble oil business through its 
controlling interest in beleaguered Paramount Petroleum Corp., which filed for 
bankruptcy protection last month. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel owns an interest in Paramount by virtue of a $65-million loan made to 
finance the acquisition of the company by an investors group in 1988 -- 
ironically to rescue Paramount from a 1984 filing under Chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code, said Paramount lawyer Alan Pedlar with Stutman, 
Treister &amp; Glatt in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount, an independent oil refiner, got itself into trouble this time around 
partly by signing contracts to deliver refined products to Unocal Corp. and 
World Oil Co. at rates that underestimated current oil prices. As a result, 
Paramount lost $30 million in 1989 on the two contracts, Pedlar said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those contracts have not been moneymakers for the company," said Peter W. 
Clapp, a lawyer for Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, which is 
representing Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paramount has been trying unsuccessfully to sell its 
46,500-barrel-per-day refinery, which produces asphalt and other products in 
the city of Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
The company was negotiating with an Indonesian corporation, Tirtamas Majutama, 
but talks fell through in January, said Paramount Chief Executive James 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
When the Indonesians withdrew their offer, Paramount's other major secured 
creditor, Dutch lender Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank N.V., or NMB Bank, 
terminated an agreement not to act on a $50-million loan, Pedlar said. That 
took place Jan. 18. By the following Monday, Paramount had made its latest 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians were only one of a dozen or so groups that Paramount talked 
with about buying the refinery, McDonald said. The others included Bernard B. 
Roth, chairman and chief executive of World Oil, an independent oil refiner and 
marketer, Pedlar said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount emerged from the earlier bankruptcy filing under the investors group, 
called Alaska Pacific Inc., that was led by Santa Barbara oilman Aubrey 
Campbell and his son, J. Timothy Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel owns 57% and Alaska Pacific 43% of the company's voting securities, 
though Drexel holds a proxy to vote 100% of the company's securities, according 
to the bankruptcy filing dated Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The filing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles lists Paramount's total assets 
at $106.5 million and total liabilities at $138.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Paramount reached agreement with NMB Bank to use cash collateral to 
continue operating for 60 days while a buyer is sought for the refinery.

FEDS REJECT SANTA BARBARA SAVINGS' PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parent company of Santa Barbara Savings disclosed Monday that federal 
regulators rejected its plan to restore its capital level, an action that puts 
the firm perilously close to being seized. 
</P>
<P>
The action also makes Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, among the state's 20 
largest thrifts, the first S&amp;L in California to publicly disclose that its 
capital plan was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Philip R. Brinkerhoff, chief executive of Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, 
said in an interview that investors or buyers are being sought for the 
institution. He said there has been interest by prospective bidders, but he 
also acknowledged that investors would have to pump about $93 million into the 
thrift to bring it into compliance with the tougher capital standards that 
federal regulators put into place for all thrifts two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Any action against Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara will not effect most 
customers because deposits up to $100,000 remain insured by the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Office of Thrift Supervision, which turned down the thrift's 
capital plan, would not comment specifically about their action. They did say 
that, barring the infusion of major new sources of capital, they generally will 
recommend that the federal Resolution Trust Corp. seize thrifts whose capital 
plans are rejected. The RTC is an agency created last year to mop up the thrift 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
Capital is the money that thrifts maintain to protect against losses. New 
thrift rules, enacted last year in the wake of the nation's S&amp;L debacle, 
require higher levels of capital to force owners to put more of their own money 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, like several other thrifts, has been hurt by 
losses in its risky, high-yield junk bonds. The company lost $23 million in the 
nine months ended Sept. 30. Santa Barbara Savings, which has 44 branches, 
operates mostly in Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. 
The company is based in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, already under severe restrictions that include a prohibition against 
making new loans, disclosed Monday that it is under even more limits. It must 
receive permission from regulators to sell or transfer assets worth more than 
$1 million and to enter into a lease for more than $500,000. Also, salaries 
have been frozen for employees making more than $50,000 a year.

<P>
La Jolla-based Intermark has completed the sale of its Munson Sporting Goods 
Co. subsidiary to Dayton, Ohio-based Outdoor Sports Headquarters for an 
undisclosed price. Munson, a leading sporting goods wholesaler in the Western 
U.S., reported $30.1 million in net sales for the nine-month period ended Dec. 
31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoor Sports Headquarters, the nation's largest full-service distributor of 
hunting, fishing, camping and archery equipment, is a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Dayton-based Centuri Inc. Its annual revenue total rose to about $250 
million with the Munson acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"Though Munson has become a pacesetter in its market, we have come to believe 
that Munson's best prospects for future growth can be achieved through 
assimilation into the Outdoor Sports organization and its commitment to the 
industry," Intermark President and Chief Executive Charles R. Scott said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Intermark on Monday reported that it had exercised an 
option to purchase 1 million shares of stock in Triton Group Ltd. The purchase 
gave Intermark voting power over 51.6% of Triton's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Intermark is a billion dollar operating/holding company listed on the American 
Stock Exchange.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
Investors' Intelligence, in the most pessimistic outlook that it has published 
since June, 1982, recently reported that 57.3% of market analysts are bearish, 
12.8% predict a correction, and 29.9% are bullish, according to Irving Katz, 
director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Contrarians think this is a positive sign for stocks because there is a pile of 
cash now sitting on the sidelines that is available to fuel the next rally, 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, the market continued to fall, and investors remained on the 
sidelines. Most San Diego stocks continued their meandering, moving a point or 
two either way, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
A new low was recorded by Great American Bank at $4.875 on Monday volume of 
287,800 shares. The stock was down $1.125 for the week. Investors are concerned 
about the delay in Great American's quarterly earnings statement, which was 
scheduled for two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp., on the other hand, moved up and down $1 during the week and 
closed unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
There was some good news helping some stocks rise. Cubic Corp. gained $1.125 to 
$17 for the week after reporting first-quarter earnings that rose 84% to 92 
cents a share, up from $.50 during the like quarter the year before. 
</P>
<P>
International Totalizator reported $.20 in fourth-quarter net income, and $.45 
for the year, as the stock gained $.5625 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
The best point gainer for the week was Mail Boxes Etc., which gained $3.25. The 
only new high was recorded by Magma Power at $33, which closed the week at 
$31.50. 
</P>
<P>
Other upward moves were made by First National, up $1.125 and Maxwell 
Laboratories, up $1. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric reacted to the unfavorable report 
of the staff of the Public Utilities Commission that came out against the 
merger with Southern California Edison. The stock closed down $1.25 for the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
X-Scribe hit a new low of $.3125 as losses continued. The company lost $.06 a 
share in its latest quarter, compared to a $.65 loss during the like quarter 
the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Annual meetings scheduled this week include Cubic on Wednesday, Psycor and 
Wavetek on Friday and DECOM Systems on Saturday.

In the interest of experience and, well, giving the other guys a chance to 
score, Georgetown coach John Thompson has decided to break up the twin towers 
of Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo and insert senior Sam Jefferson into the 
starting lineup. For the Hoyas, this has all the significance of changing socks 
after practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never felt it was a special honor to start," Thompson said. "We are a 
team of finishers, not a team of starters. We give a lot more credence to who 
is in there at the end, not who is in there at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, what's the difference if the Hoyas pound you at the beginning 
or the end, so long as they pound you. And that is what they have been doing 
since Jefferson, a 6-9 senior, and forward Anthony Allen, a 6-6 senior, were 
inserted into the lineup to give Georgetown what Thompson calls "more 
cohesiveness at the start of the game. It helps to set the tone."

Georgetown has won four consecutive games to push its record to 19-2 and a 
remarkably similar pattern has emerged. After falling behind, 14-0, at the 
start of their loss to Connecticut and 17-10 at the start of their loss to 
Syracuse, the Hoyas got off to a 10-2 start in their rout of Seton Hall, a 9-2 
start in a victory against St. John's and a 19-9 start in a 97-81 thrashing of 
Pitt. The only exception was the 16-point victory against Florida in which 
Georgetown fell behind 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of those tough games with Connecticut and Syracuse, I think it is very 
important for us to start off on a positive note," Thompson said. "That's one 
of the reasons I shifted the upperclassmen into that (starting) position, and I 
think Sam and Anthony have done a very adequate job." 
</P>
<P>
The switch has not handcuffed Thompson from pairing Mutombo, the 7-2 center 
from Kinshasa, Zaire, with the 6-10 Mourning. The two towers started the first 
17 games before Thompson juggled his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"Early in the year it was very effective; they adjusted to each other and 
played very well together," said guard Dwayne Bryant, team leader in assists. 
"But as the year went on and things got more difficult, we got two quicker 
players in there that enabled us to get the running game in gear." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a chink in the Hoyas' armor, it is that the Mourning-Mutombo 
combination can slow the break. But that can also be the beauty of the 
Georgetown scheme: The Hoyas can beat you by swatting away shots, or they can 
run by you with their four-on-the-floor offense, which has been accelerated by 
freshman point guard David Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows who you might play in the tournament?" Bryant said. "You may play a 
team like Loyola Marymount. They don't have two guys to stop them if we go 
half-court. We don't ever want to stop running, but it's good to know if you 
have to play half-court, we can." 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown has been in the NCAA tournament the past 11 seasons, but not in the 
Final Four since 1985, when they played in the championship game for the third 
time in four years. Can they make it back? 
</P>
<P>
"When they are playing like that," Pitt coach Paul Evans said after his 
16-point defeat, "they are pretty much unstoppable." 
</P>
<P>
The key is Mourning. The sophomore is on the verge of stardom. He is second on 
the team with an 18.3 scoring average and second to Mutombo in rebounding and 
blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in our discovery of other players, we lose sight of Alonzo," 
Thompson said. "Alonzo's a pretty good player. I think he's getting more 
mature. Alonzo has been one consistent thread that is very important for us." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, 5-10 freshman from New York, averaged 41 points and six assists as a 
prep senior. His flamboyant style is a drastic departure from the Hoyas' 
disciplined attack, but Thompson does not appear to mind -- too much. In one 
brief display of grandstanding, Edwards dribbled back and forth between his 
legs at center court, retrieved a one-handed pass that had been deflected and 
went back between his legs before nailing a three-pointer from the top of the 
circle. While Mourning and reserve forward Michael Tate celebrated on the 
bench, Thompson stood quietly, hands on hips, glaring at Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been playing very, very well," Bryant said. "He's very, very quick and 
he's good with the ball, which has enabled me and Mark (Tillmon) to look for 
chances to score." 
</P>
<P>
Tillmon, a 6-2 senior who has missed only three games in his college career, is 
Georgetown's leading scorer, averaging 20.7. In Thompson's ever-changing 
lineup, he and Bryant are the closest to mainstays. Both are averaging about 33 
minutes in Big East games. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this team because of the camaraderie," Bryant said. "Anytime you have a 
team where everyone is together you got a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Record: 19-2. Coach: John Thompson (418-137). 
</P>
<P>
Lineup: Mark Tillmon, 6-2 senior, 20.7 ppg, 3.6 rpg; Dwayne Bryant, 6-2 senior, 
10.7, 4.5; Alonzo Mourning, 6-10 sophomore, 18.3, 9.0; Sam Jefferson, 6-9 
senior, 3.0, 3.7; Anthony Allen, 6-6 senior, 2.1, 1.6. 
</P>
<P>
Sidelights: 
</P>
<P>
Nickname: Hoyas. Colors: Blue and gray. Campus landmark: Healy Building, at 
center of campus, distinguishable by its clock tower. 
</P>
<P>
Famous alumni: John Mitchell, John Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Did you know: The school's former nickname was "Stonewalls." The current 
nickname was derived from "Hoya Saxa," a combination of Greek and Latin terms 
meaning, "What Rocks!" 
</P>
<P>
Best name on roster: Dikembe Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
Claim to fame: George Washington gave his inaugural address at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Bottom line: Georgetown has size, depth and experienced guards to win the 
national title.

BODY-FAT CALCULATORS WEIGH IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern Californians are hooking up to some unusual machines these days in the 
name of fitness. 
</P>
<P>
They are shooting beams of infrared light into their biceps or allowing 
electrodes to be attached to their hands and feet. They are plunging underwater 
on a cadaver scale or enduring the humiliation of having their "love handles" 
squeezed by a stranger wielding calipers. 
</P>
<P>
All of these procedures measure body fat, and they have become popular 
offerings in some Southern California health clubs, weight-control centers and 
wellness clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I do fitness testing, (body fat) is the issue that everyone wants to talk 
about," said Ellen Turkel, a consultant for corporate wellness programs and 
health clubs. "You can talk about flexibility until you're blue in the face, 
but when you start talking about body fat, they're on the edge of their seats." 
</P>
<P>
Experts caution, however, that as testing and new machinery proliferate, so 
does the chance of getting inaccurate or misleading results. They urge anyone 
undergoing body-fat tests to consider the skill of the test-givers, pretest 
conditions and equipment limitations for each of the five most common 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that high-tech gets a lot of publicity because it looks exciting and 
because people who are trying to sell products are pushing them," said Paul 
Schmidt, a fitness specialist with the city of San Diego. "But things are 
misused quite often." 
</P>
<P>
Body fat isn't all evil. Layered under the skin and packed around organs, fat 
insulates the body from cold, cushions it against injury and supplies it with 
essential everyday fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Too much body fat, however, increases a person's risk of hypertension, diabetes 
and high cholesterol, among other problems. 
</P>
<P>
A study done at San Diego's Naval Health Research Center, to be published this 
year, concluded that men with more than 22% fat and women with more than 33% 
fat are at significant health risk. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, "ideal" body fat percentages vary. Depending on whom you ask, a 
healthy rate for men ranges anywhere from 6% to 25%, while a healthy woman's 
body fat can range from 9% to as high as 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Health clubs and wellness centers that test body fat typically use one of five 
procedures: the old standards of underwater weighing, skin-fold calipers and 
circumference equations and the newer infrared technology and bio-electrical 
impedance machines, which conduct low-level electricity through the body. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Schmidt compared the five procedures in a study on 75 police 
officer trainees -- a primarily young and relatively fit test population. His 
results rated skin-fold calipers as the second most accurate method behind 
underwater weighing, the "gold standard" of body-fat testing. Circumference 
equations came in next, followed by the infrared technique and, finally, the 
bio-electrical impedance. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Lohman, a professor and researcher in the University of Arizona's 
department of exercise and sports sciences, ranks the methods differently, 
based on studies with participants more typical of the average population. 
</P>
<P>
He says impedance, "if the machine is reliable," and skin-fold calipers, if the 
tester is well-trained, come in second to underwater weighing. Circumference 
measurements are third. Infrared, which is so new that it hasn't been widely 
tested in independent studies, is the least reliable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a rundown on each of the five testing methods. 
</P>
<P>
* INFRARED: The infrared machine, marketed under the name Futrex 5000, is an 
outgrowth of U.S. Department of Agriculture research on pig fat. It operates on 
the premise that fat refracts light differently than muscle and bone do. 
</P>
<P>
Using a wand attached to a small hand-held microprocessor, the instrument 
shoots a beam of infrared light into the body halfway between the shoulder and 
elbow on the biceps of the person's dominant arm. Manufacturer Futrex Inc., of 
Gaithersburg, Md., claims that fat measured here is directly proportional to 
total body fat. 
</P>
<P>
The infrared light beam passes quickly through fat, then bends as it hits 
muscle and bone. The machine calculates percent body fat as it measures that 
bend. 
</P>
<P>
The Futrex machine costs about $2,000, according to Tori Tunnell, sales manager 
for the company. He said that individual tests, while most often included in a 
comprehensive body-composition analysis and wellness screening package, can 
cost as little as $15. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Rams have included the machine in their body-fat testing 
equipment. But the team uses the machine for spot checking all over the body, 
according to Garrett Giemont, the team's strength trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the Futrex 5000 liken it to a blood pressure test. There is no 
need to remove clothes, lie down, be dunked under water or meet pretest 
conditions, they say. The instrument also allows for self-testing. 
</P>
<P>
But Anita Jones, health promotion director for Accents on Health, a San Diego 
wellness clinic, said the machine isn't nearly as easy to operate as its 
instructions indicate. To find the right spot at the "belly" of the biceps 
takes a lot of practice, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lohman said that although he hasn't yet tested the machine, one of its 
limitations is that, unlike the other methods, the manufacturer suggests only 
one measurement location to determine total percent body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern, exercise physiologists say, is that the infrared light beam 
shoots only a limited distance into the body, and that could affect the 
accuracy of measurements on obese people. 
</P>
<P>
But a company spokesman says the depth of the light beam is accounted for in 
the machine's software and that the beam is but one of the variables entered 
into the software's equation that determines percent body fat. Other variables 
include activity level, height, weight, gender and body frame. 
</P>
<P>
* BIO-ELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE: The bio-impedance method, out for about four years, 
measures resistance to electricity to determine percent body fat. Operators 
attach two electrodes each to specific locations on the foot and hand through 
which they introduce a low-energy, high-frequency electrical current. 
</P>
<P>
Lean muscle, which has high water content, easily conducts the electricity, 
while fat resists. Measurement of that resistance predicts the body fat 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla Scientific, a San Diego-based company, is one of the industry's top 
two manufacturers of the machines, which cost between $2,500 and $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Some exercise physiologists point out that many variables can affect body fat 
measured with this equipment. When a person last ate, drank and exercised can 
influence results of the test, which costs from $40 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get reliable measurements," said Turkel, the corporate wellness 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "I think they're on the cutting edge, and in the next few 
years, people will be considering it more seriously." 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla's operation manual cautions that to ensure accurate test results, the 
following conditions should be avoided: participation in heavy exercise within 
eight hours of the test; water loss or dehydration due to hot weather, exercise 
or inadequate fluid intake; consumption of excessive quantities of food within 
six hours of the test, of water within four hours, of caffeine within three 
hours, or of alcohol within 48 hours; fasting within 72 hours of the test; 
using the bathroom more than an hour before the test, and excessive water 
retention during the three days before a woman's menstrual period and seven 
days afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla trains anyone who buys the equipment to observe the pretest 
conditions, Clark said. "Proper medical procedure is like any other test." 
</P>
<P>
* SKIN-FOLD CALIPERS: Skin-fold calipers, developed in the 1930s to measure the 
fat content of pigs on their way to market, are perhaps the best known devices 
used to measure body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Operators use a plier-shaped apparatus -- one of a dozen types -- to pinch 
flesh in three or more body locations. Readings are correlated with an equation 
that takes into consideration a person's gender, height, weight and age. The 
equations are particular to specific calipers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not old-fashioned, but the old-fashioned calipers really seem to work," 
Turkel said. "It's done on so many people that they're quite reliable." 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the YMCA has used calipers to measure body fat for several decades, 
said Don Hanna, who sits on the organization's national program development 
committee. Though the Y recently has been "deluged" by companies selling newer 
machines, corporate researchers have decided to stick with calipers for the 
foreseeable future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the test is simple enough for the recipient, experts say the procedure 
is frequently mishandled by untrained or inexperienced operators. When that 
happens, the average error rate can rise to as much as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
* CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS: After considering the use of skin-fold calipers 
to test its personnel nationwide, the Navy went with circumference 
measurements. According to Jim Hodgdon, a Naval Health Research Center program 
director, results are generally as good as skin folds and the method is much 
more easily taught to operators. 
</P>
<P>
Simple, tape-measured dimensions -- such as a man's neck, abdomen and height -- 
are plugged into equations similar to those for calipers. Results have 
generally been on a par with skin folds, often with less of an error margin, 
said Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as accurate as anything else," he said. "These are numbers that are very 
practical, and people can relate to them. I strongly suggest a move back toward 
use of circumference measurements." 
</P>
<P>
* UNDERWATER WEIGHING: Using the principal that fat floats, while muscle and 
bone sink, underwater weighing actually measures the amount of water your 
submerged body displaces. That figure helps estimate body density, which in 
turn predicts percent body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Underwater weighing is certainly the most inconvenient of techniques. 
Typically, only a few hospitals, universities and athletic teams have the 
equipment. (Tests cost about $50 to the public.) To be tested, a person must 
don a bathing suit, balance on what has traditionally been a cadaver scale, 
exhale all of his or her breath and hold it out for as long as possible 
underwater, repeating the procedure six or seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not practical for most settings," Turkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Though other methods gauge their accuracy by hydrostatic body-fat measurements, 
the technique isn't without its own errors, fitness experts say. Consider the 
results logged for several world-class athletes: less than 1% body fat. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say that occurs because the method assumes the same muscle and bone 
density for everyone, regardless of ethnic, gender and age differences. 
</P>
<P>
"That can't possibly be true," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
For most accurate results, residual air volume -- or the air left in your lungs 
and esophagus also must be measured. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the method chosen, experts urge common sense in dealing with 
body-fat test results. 
</P>
<P>
Caloric restrictions and aerobic exercise are the only ways to reduce body fat, 
though weight reduction doesn't automatically mean a reduction in fat. 
</P>
<P>
And there's no such thing as spot reducing. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I lose it off my thighs or off my tummy?" Carter said. "The answer is, in 
general, no. You lose it overall." 
</P>
<P>
Carter and other experts also counsel those rushing to measure body fat not to 
place too much emphasis on a small aspect of overall wellness. 
</P>
<P>
"People are taking these things very seriously these days -- a little too 
seriously," Lohman said. "So many people are so dissatisfied with their 
(results) but are in a very healthy range." 
</P>
<P>
Said Schmidt: "We get too hung up on our body-fat assessment versus looking at 
the big picture of health and wellness and life style. When body fat preempts 
that, we're missing the point."

GOOD MANNERS IN THE '90S; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S A POLITE PERSON TO DO IN THE AGE OF FAX AND AIDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Amy: 
</P>
<P>
Help! 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, make that: Help, please! 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Vanderbilt, you must be turning over in your grave because of the problems 
that polite society is suffering as we enter the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, as manners go, I'm not exactly a model of decorum. (I take special 
pleasure in cutting off Camaros on the freeway). But even I know there should 
be a better way of congratulating your second husband on the birth of his first 
child from his third marriage than just looking embarrassed and saying, "Gee, 
you told me you'd had a vasectomy!" 
</P>
<P>
Or writing to all your friends in one fell swoop by using the recall button on 
the personal computer. Or telling a potential sexual partner to use a condom by 
strategically leaving a dozen boxes of Trojans next to the Champagne in the 
refrigerator. Or wrestling with the complexities of call-waiting by shouting 
"Hang on!" or murmuring "Sorry, this new caller is richer than you, Mr. 
Murdock." 
</P>
<P>
Just consider, for instance, the contretemps I found myself in just trying to 
write this story. I was chatting on the phone to New York etiquette arbiter 
Charlotte Ford when suddenly I heard a "beep" and Miss Manners (a.k.a. Judith 
Martin) was holding on call waiting from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, what do I do, Charlotte?" I asked in a panic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy," she replied, soothingly. "I think that whoever's on the phone 
first when call-waiting comes in takes precedence. Tell the other person you'll 
call them back." 
</P>
<P>
Hmmm, logical enough. So I clicked back to Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"Judith? I've got Charlotte Ford on the other line, and she says I should stay 
on the phone with her and call you back. Does that sound OK?" 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners paused a moment to consider. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Martin purred. 
</P>
<P>
What I need, Amy, is a definitive guide to all this stuff. Something to keep 
right by the bedside to govern matters of a sexual, or nonsexual, nature. It's 
no good to find out the proper way to act after the fact. By then my social 
life is going to degenerate into watching reruns of "Facts of Life." 
</P>
<P>
But wait, what are these packages on my desk? Could it be that America's 
foremost etiquette experts have been working overtime to establish polite 
parameters for the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
Some of these books are from the usual suspects: Judith Martin, Letitia 
Baldridge, and Charlotte Ford. But, suddenly there are new names making waves 
in the manners business. After all, who better than Sidney Biddle Barrows of 
Mayflower Madam fame to solve such bedroom dilemmas as: Do you make eye contact 
at an orgy? (No.) Do you use your lover's toothbrush? (Yes.) 
</P>
<P>
"My literary agent thought up the idea," Barrows confides. "Most people think 
sex is inherently not very polite, and certainly not something one talks about 
unless one absolutely has to. But etiquette is a way of romancing between men 
and women. And now that we're not jumping into bed with someone, we need 
something like this to drag out the courtship a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
All the authors attempt to create a new code of etiquette for a new time. Let's 
see, Amy, how do I explain it? Men are sometimes women. A child can have four 
different mothers. Answering machines talk to one another. 
</P>
<P>
As social arbiter Letitia Baldridge notes, "Manners comprise everything in our 
human relationships, all the things that we do all day long and the way we 
interrelate with people. And if any of these things change, then we want to 
change with them." 
</P>
<P>
That's why Baldridge, the former chief of staff during Jackie Kennedy's stint 
as First Lady, has written her "Complete Guide to the New Manners for the 
'90s." (Remember her, Amy? In 1978, four years after your death, she updated 
your etiquette book. Then Tish decided she was a big enough name to go it 
alone.) 
</P>
<P>
Baldridge, who cheerfully dispenses advice on what a pregnant bride should wear 
and whether it's polite to send a dinner invitation through the fax machine, is 
convinced that manners are making a comeback in the '90s. "You bet. I see it in 
my mail, I see it in the people I lecture." 
</P>
<P>
But why? "We became very self-obsessed in the '80s when the philosophy was 
'succeed, make money and spend it.' And I think it's time to stand back and 
start spending as much energy thinking about other people." 
</P>
<P>
I thought, at 646 pages, Baldridge's book would be le dernier cri. Yet, it's 
beaten hands down in sheer heft and chutzpah by fellow Washingtonian Judith 
Martin's latest opus, released in November and entitled grandly enough, "Miss 
Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium." The syndicated columnist takes 
742 pages to impart her wit and wisdom on contemporary quandaries from the 
decline of the nuclear family to the rise in women in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Are things really that bad to warrant so much space? "Certainly," Martin 
sniffs. "We have such a long way to go to get to some place approaching 
civilization." 
</P>
<P>
It's her view that American society is coming to the end of a generation-long 
experiment that started in the '60s when the baby-boomers decided just to chuck 
existing rules of behavior and be themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what I call the Jean Jacques Rousseau School of Etiquette," Miss 
Manners relates. "The problem being that in our natural state we're not all 
that livable." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Martin sees our current social situation complicated by two main 
factors: technology -- the fax machine and answering machines weren't 
ubiquitous a decade ago -- and sex. Not only are sexually transmitted diseases 
a topic that must be addressed these days, but so is sexual etiquette in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
"The very simple rule that takes care of most of these problems -- that gender 
is simply not relevant in the workplace -- is a very difficult concept to get 
across. Because once you realize that, then the questions of who goes through 
the door first and who pays for lunch are very easily settled by rank and 
position." 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK, already. I'm beginning to feel like I've spent the last month locked in 
a finishing school. Luckily, that King of the Quip, P. J. O'Rourke, has come to 
my rescue with his "Modern Manners: An Etiquette Book for Rude People," 
published in paperback this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Written with enough churlishness to make "The War of the Roses" look like a 
lovefest, this guide contains such ungentlemanly advice as how to falsify a 
family tree and how to commit polite crime. And among the many '90s questions 
answered is my personal favorite: how many pierced earrings to wear? 
</P>
<P>
"Start with the number two and add one earring for each of the following 
phrases that accurately describes your life: bulimia, drug dependency, sexual 
promiscuity, from Queens, boyfriend in a band," O'Rourke writes. "Now, subtract 
one earring for each of the following phrases that you answer yes to: I just 
took my LSATs, my parents are on their way for a visit, I have a church wedding 
coming up." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Amy, this book's overall effect is to make me want to slug its author. 
Maybe that's one reason why O'Rourke didn't bother responding to the plaintive 
message I left on his Washington answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
Compare that to the Mayflower Madam's behavior. She was only too willing to be 
interviewed about this month's "Mayflower Manners," which describes itself as 
an "Etiquette for Consenting Adults." Of course, Barrows is the very picture of 
politeness as she delves into such uncharted territory as: Is it rude to rip an 
exotic garment off a woman? (It depends on how much the thing costs.) Or when 
two people meet through personal ads, who is the host? (Whoever placed the ad.) 
Or even whether there are basic principles of etiquette that apply to the 
menage a trois. (No one should show favoritism.) 
</P>
<P>
Barrows, of course, believes she's providing a valuable public service. "I 
don't think you'll find anywhere in the other books the proper etiquette for 
treating a call girl or escort service. And I don't think you'll see too many 
pages on how to behave at an S &amp; M party in a club or a private home. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think, 'Ugh, an etiquette book' and think of Letitia Baldridge 
and all that dry, ponderous stuff," says Barrows, defending her lighter touch. 
"That's what makes my book fun." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't fun at all when a seemingly simple question about AIDS drew 
Barrows into a national controversy recently and one gay activist group in New 
York City claimed the Mayflower Madam had made a major faux pas. 
</P>
<P>
The question was: "If a host invites a known carrier of AIDS to a dinner party, 
should he so inform his other guests?" 
</P>
<P>
Barrows responded: "Yes. Most people will know that they cannot contract the 
disease by being seated at a dinner table with a carrier. But it is a courtesy 
to all to let them know ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Barrows was "disinvited" to the premiere of a movie, while her 
publisher, Doubleday, was asked to issue an apology. 
</P>
<P>
Using language not printable in a family newspaper, Barrows fumed that she had 
been the victim of a setup by "a very radical gay group that's always looking 
for media attention. How could I be disinvited to something when I was never 
invited in the first place? This whole thing is so personally upsetting to me I 
can't tell you. It's a real nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
As for what to do in the situation, Barrows still sticks by her advice. "I have 
a huge number of gay friends and every time I've ever been invited anywhere I 
was always told if there was somebody with AIDS who was going to be there. Not 
because these people were trying to warn me. But because they wanted other 
guests to have an extra level of sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, both Baldridge and Martin didn't see the necessity for 
telling anyone anything. "At most respectable dinner parties," notes Miss 
Manners, "there wouldn't be any activity where you would catch AIDS so I don't 
see why you should have to tell people." 
</P>
<P>
But etiquette arbiter Charlotte Ford professed some confusion as to what to do. 
"Hmmm. Such a tough situation," she murmured. "I think there are certain people 
who don't care, and there are other people who would be just devastated if they 
were at a party with someone who had AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Her solution, she decided, was simply not to invite the person with AIDS to 
dinner -- which AIDS support groups say is also wrong. 
</P>
<P>
So who's right, Amy? I honestly don't know. The only thing I'm certain of is 
that by next week, next month, next year, another social phenomenon will create 
another conundrum for etiquette experts. 
</P>
<P>
And, Amy, you won't be here to help us through it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What's the office etiquette when men and women work together? 
</P>
<P>
 JUDITH MARTIN: The very simple rule that takes care of most problems is that 
gender is simply not relevant in the workplace. Once you realize that, then the 
questions of who goes through the door first and who pays for lunch are very 
easily settled. It should be settled just as if it were an all-male workplace 
-- by rank and position. 
</P>
<P>
CHARLOTTE FORD: If I was a woman and invited to dinner by a male colleague, I 
would certainly say, "Let's have lunch first." I just wouldn't be available for 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
P.J. O'ROURKE: Anyone who has good manners on the job probably won't have that 
job long. Courtesy does not belong in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you ask a man to wear a condom? 
</P>
<P>
 LETITIA BALDRIDGE: You can say to him, "I'm very sorry, but if you don't use a 
condom, there's just no way we can be together." You can then give him some, or 
tell him where the nearest drugstore is, or tell him, "Let's have dinner 
another night," and send him away. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN: If you know the person well enough to make that necessary, you ought to 
be able to say anything. What amuses me is when people shift into prudery. If 
you are on intimate terms with somebody, surely you can ask them intimate 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
FORD: I'd be a little bit embarrassed and a little bit shy and say, "Listen, I 
hope you've taken some sort of protection because I don't want to contract any 
diseases, and I'm sure you don't either." 
</P>
<P>
SYDNEY BIDDLE BARROWS: It is not seemly, nor necessary, to smile on the first 
date and say, "Love your dress. By the way, will you be giving me a fatal 
disease?" Instead, allow time to pass -- that's what these dates are for, after 
all. By the time sex seems a possibility, you will have necessarily both 
crossed that line beyond which these sensitive issues may be discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're giving a dinner party and invite someone who has AIDS, should you 
tell your other guests? 
</P>
<P>
 BALDRIDGE: I don't think you tell anybody that the person has AIDS. Because 
frankly the guests are not catching AIDS from that person. It really isn't 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN: It depends on the activity of the dinner party. At most respectable 
dinner parties, there wouldn't be any activity where you would catch AIDS, so I 
don't see why should have to tell people. Would you tell your guests that one 
of them had cancer? But if you were giving an orgy, I think you should tell 
people. 
</P>
<P>
FORD: I don't know that I would invite somebody to dinner knowing they have 
AIDS, simply because I think it would make everybody very uncomfortable. But I 
think it all depends on the situation. If you are going to do that, I think you 
have to be very careful how you do it and whom you invite. 
</P>
<P>
BARROWS: Yes. Most people will know that they cannot contract the disease by 
being seated at a dinner table with a carrier. But it is a courtesy to all to 
let them know ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the proper way to use your answering machine? 
</P>
<P>
 BALDRIDGE: The best way is to record as short a message as possible, 15 
seconds, and be very business-like and be very up. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN: The telephone is a very rude instrument. Monitoring calls on the 
answering machine is polite. People somehow put the onus of politeness 
mistakenly against people who do not accept all calls at any time. There is 
nothing wrong with picking and choosing. 
</P>
<P>
O'ROURKE: With judicious use of answering machines, a love affair can be 
conducted without the bother of ever talking to the loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it polite for a mother to breast-feed her baby in public? 
</P>
<P>
 BALDRIDGE: Definitely not. Anyone looking over, especially any man, 
immediately starts to conjecture about the size and shape of the breast. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN: No. In some countries people breast-feed on the street, but it is not 
done properly in the United States, and the argument that it is a natural thing 
bears no weight with me. 
</P>
<P>
FORD: I've always said that whatever a mother wants to do is her business. The 
only thing is, I think you should do it in private. Go to an airport area not 
populated by people, go into another room in someone's house. 
</P>
<P>
 If a child has several sets of parents because of divorces, how do you decide 
who should come to school on parents' day? 
</P>
<P>
 BALDRIDGE: It's up to the child to decide whom he or she wants. The child 
should ask that parent to come and then apologize to the others and explain why 
they weren't asked. 
</P>
<P>
FORD: It all depends on the relationship between the adults. Forget the 
children. It's the adults that set the mood for whatever the function's going 
to be. It's very, very hard, but somebody's got to bite the bullet. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN: That is incredibly complicated. I'd say parents, their mates and 
assorted other people who want to be involved. I was president of a school 
board where we didn't realize for a long time that it was offensive to send out 
questionnaires where it gave only one line for "mother's name" and "father's 
name." So we would put four lines under each for families to do what they 
liked. So those things have had to be adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the worst new breach of entertaining etiquette? 
</P>
<P>
 BALDRIDGE: Some people feel that they should turn on their TV sets even at 
dinner parties. I've seen guests leave the table to go and watch their favorite 
football game in the library. 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN: The understood social contract whereby the host sets the terms of the 
contract and the guests can take it or leave it has broken down miserably. 
People now consider an invitation to be the opening of negotiations. You tell 
me what you're serving for dinner, and then I tell you this is going to kill 
me, or you tell me who the other guests are and then I decide if I want to 
accept. And heaven forbid if you try to set a dress code. 
</P>
<P>
FORD: Hosts who ask guests to take their shoes off. You have to respect your 
host's wishes. But as somebody said, if their carpets are that good, why do 
they ever have any guests? 
</P>

ROBERT HILBURN: A NEW JUST-SAY-NO MOTLEY CRUE; 
</P>
<P>
ROCKERS: FANS CELEBRATE THE REFORMED POSTURE OF A BAND ONCE KNOWN AS THE BAD 
BOYS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL.

"Crue . . . Crue . . . Crue . . . Crue . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the audience chants as the four members of Motley Crue stood 
on stage at the end of the rock band's nearly two-hour concert on Sunday at the 
San Diego Sports Arena seemed far more deeply rooted and emotional than your 
usual closing salute. 
</P>
<P>
The fans -- mostly in their teens or early 20s -- appeared to be celebrating 
not only the group's music, but also its survival. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Motley Crue -- a band that came together on the streets of Los 
Angeles -- was one of the most celebrated bad-boy acts in rock. 
</P>
<P>
But the sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll life style was so out of control that one 
much-publicized tragedy and several near misses led the group to decide after 
its 1987 tour to go "clean and sober." 
</P>
<P>
Though the quartet didn't make references to its new posture on stage Sunday, 
every one of the more than three dozen fans interviewed in the arena before the 
show knew -- from interviews or word-of-mouth -- about the reformed attitude in 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
Most seemed pleased by the decision -- not so much for the reasons of "giving a 
good example" that parents would applaud, but for a more practical, rock 'n' 
roll one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great that they're off drugs and stuff because I enjoy the band 
and it means we'll still be able to see them," said Kevin Crawford, 16. "Who 
knows how long they would have been around otherwise?" 
</P>
<P>
Crawford and virtually everyone else questioned said they feel a few teen-agers 
may be influenced by Motley Crue's actions to stop taking drugs, but they felt 
that the issue of rock stars' influence over fans is vastly overrated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been listening to (hard-rock) bands for years and I've never taken 
drugs," said Rick Stewart, 18. "And I know kids at school who took drugs who 
never went to concerts. So what's the connection? A rational person makes up 
his own mind." 
</P>
<P>
Backstage before the concert, Nikki Sixx, the band's bassist, was curious about 
the fans' reactions. He was worried before the release late last year of the 
group's latest album, "Dr. Feelgood," of a possible backlash among Motley fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very worried that people were going to say we had turned into Pat Boone 
because we weren't drinking and raising hell," Sixx, 31, said, sitting in an 
arena office. 
</P>
<P>
"But the reaction to the new album and to the tour has been great. I said to my 
girlfriend tonight, it's like us and Aerosmith kind of made it hip to be sober. 
In a way, it's as hip to be sober as it was to be (the decadents) that the 
Rolling Stones portrayed all those years." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's concert was Motley Crue's first stop on a "homecoming" Southern 
California swing, with support band Faster Pussycat, that was scheduled to 
include stops on Monday and tonight at the Forum in Inglewood and Thursday at 
the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always sort of a homecoming coming back to (Southern California), but 
this time is extra special because this is the first time we have done a tour 
straight," Sixx said, a cup of coffee and a bottle of mineral water on the desk 
in front of him. "We're having so much more fun and we have so much more energy 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in pretty good condition for the first show the last time we played the 
Forum (in 1987), but I stayed up from the first show all the way through the 
second show, freebasing and shooting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"So when I was on stage the second night, I was hallucinating. They threw me 
into the limo after the show and I was devastated when I looked back on that 
night. I remember thinking, 'Here I played a place that I dreamed about playing 
since I was a kid and I was such a (fool) that I can't even remember the show.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Sixx and the fans should have no trouble remembering Sunday's show. 
</P>
<P>
Motley Crue is not a great rock band, but it has far more personality and 
old-fashioned sideshow appeal than the herd of lite metal bands that have given 
the genre such a terrible name over the last two decades -- the distressingly 
calculated and heartless parade of your Bon Jovis (on the somewhat pretentious 
side) to the Ratts, Cinderellas and Quiet Riots (on the simply drab, posturing 
side). 
</P>
<P>
Like Aerosmith, Motley Crue is a more entertaining group live now that it is 
focusing on the music rather than partially hiding behind an image. While the 
group always benefited from an undercurrent of humor, the band's playing was 
often wobbly and the themes quite one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
Even the new "Dr. Feelgood" is filled with crude and rude songs about male 
sexual fantasies, a side of the group's music that will still make parents 
uneasy. But the parents would probably have been more concerned Sunday by what 
they saw in the audience than on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Motley Crue was joined on stage by two scantily clad female backup stingers, 
but their theatrical attire was almost timid compared with the ever-so-tight 
minidresses and plunging blouses worn by hundreds of teen-age girls in the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The concert itself was a fast-paced affair, whose energetic tone was set by 
lead singer Vince Neil as he raced around the stage in his biker attire in time 
with the frantic beat of the music. 
</P>
<P>
While Sixx and guitarist Mick Mars -- who co-wrote most of the songs on the new 
album -- also moved about almost constantly, drummer Tommy Lee conveyed the 
band's zany teen-age spirit best as he played drums at one point on a revolving 
platform high above the audience. He ended the interlude by mooning the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Motley Crue didn't lecture, but the band did send out one signal: no more 
bottles of booze on stage. Many in the audience were surprised in 1987 when 
Sixx and Lee guzzled Jack Daniel's during the first of the two Forum shows, 
even though Neil was convicted in 1985 for alcohol-related vehicular 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Neil's accident, in which his passenger, rock drummer Nicholas Dingley, 
was killed and a couple in the other car were seriously injured -- enough to 
persuade the rest of Motley Crue to get off drugs and alcohol? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Sixx replied backstage. "It slowed Vince down for a little while and we 
all tried (going straight) at different times. It wasn't even my (near-fatal 
overdose in 1987) that stopped us. That shows how messed up and addicted you 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
"It had been part of us and our image for so long. In the early days, the 
(substance abuse) worked for us. It helped me get on stage. I was so nervous 
when I was 17 or 18. A few drinks helped, but then it became expected of us. 
</P>
<P>
"The more that our reputation grew, the more was expected. If someone came back 
to the dressing room and if we weren't all doing lines or taking a couple of 
'ludes or doing some serious drinking, people would ask, 'Aren't you guys into 
it tonight?' " 
</P>
<P>
One of the factors that led the band members to change their ways was the 
desire to grow musically. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we said either we knock this thing on the head and go out with a 
bang or let's forge ahead and do something musically that is going to blow 
people away, and the only way we could do that was get rid of our addiction." 
</P>
<P>
About not making a more direct anti-drug statement in the music or in the show, 
Sixx said, "I try not to get up on a soap box about it because I don't think 
that's my role. But I am pleased if people can look at us and see something 
positive. . . . If they say, 'Wow, these guys are kicking butt and they are 
doing it straight. I might want to try that.' If that happens, great, but it's 
got to come from them." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the concert, the message seemed encouragingly clear. Even after 
the band had retired to the dressing room, the chanting continued. "Crue . . . 
Crue . . . Crue . . . Crue . . . Crue."

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. RESIDENTS SEE INCREASE IN CRIME BUT PRAISE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County residents believe that crime has worsened in the past decade, but 
most still feel safe at home or strolling alone through their neighborhoods at 
night and give high marks to their local police departments, The Times Poll has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Orange County residents said they believe officers exercise good 
judgment, do not push people around and are prompt in answering calls for 
service. The departments are mostly color-blind -- treating members of ethnic 
minorities equally -- and they are adequately staffed, survey respondents said. 
</P>
<P>
One Orange County police chief said he was not surprised by the public's sound 
support for local law enforcement, which produced a 78% approval rating in The 
Times Poll for local police and a 69% approval for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 10 years, police departments in general have been strongly 
committed to their communities, listening to what their communities have to 
say," Garden Grove Police Chief John Robertson said. "There was a time in the 
history of police work -- no exception in Orange County -- where (police) were 
isolated to themselves." 
</P>
<P>
I.A. Lewis, director of The Times Poll, said that Orange County's affluence 
helps explain the generally positive attitudes about personal safety and law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"This has a lot to do with income level. People who live in poor areas are 
victimized more by crime," Lewis said. "Since the general income level in 
Orange County is higher, you might expect less victimization." 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll was conducted among 1,901 residents of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties on Feb. 3 through 7. It has an accuracy range of plus or minus 3% 
overall, 4% among Orange County respondents. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, Orange County residents feel safer and more crime-free than people 
in Los Angeles. The results also showed that Orange County residents have a 
better opinion of police than do people in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the staffing of police departments, 57% of those surveyed in Orange 
County said present law-enforcement strength is "about right," while 38% said 
more police are needed. 
</P>
<P>
About 90% of those responding to the survey in Orange County said they are 
confident that their local officers will protect them from becoming victims of 
crimes. Most even believe that more officers could be deployed to high-crime 
areas and that law-abiding citizens would not be less protected. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all Orange County residents feel secure in their homes, with 93% of 
respondents reporting that they feel "somewhat safe" or "very safe." 
</P>
<P>
Two out of five Orange County residents said they feel "very safe" walking the 
streets of their neighborhoods and another two out of five said they feel 
"somewhat safe." About 20% said they feel either somewhat or very unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, there has been little appreciable change in the perceived safety of 
neighborhoods and homes in the past several years. Times polls dating from 1979 
to the present have typically showed similar numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of Orange County residents believe that crime is more 
serious now than a decade ago. Another 31% said it is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
Two in every 10 Orange County residents surveyed said that they or members of 
their families were victims of crimes last year. Of those, most said the crime 
was auto theft or burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't necessarily blame cops for crime," Lewis said. "More often than 
not, they blame the courts for crime and the prisons for crime. . . . Police 
are by and large a personification of a guardian." 
</P>
<P>
Most people said that police treat blacks, Latinos and Asians the same way that 
they treat whites. But of those people who noted a difference, about a third 
said that Latinos are treated rougher than whites. 
</P>
<P>
In polling both Orange and Los Angeles counties, the survey found that almost 
half of the blacks questioned said there was at least "a fair amount" of police 
brutality in the Southern California area, a rate more than twice that of 
Anglos. More than a third of the blacks questioned said they or a family member 
had been intimidated or harassed by law enforcement officers. In Orange County, 
the survey did not include ethnic breakdowns, Lewis said, because statistical 
samples of minority groups were not large enough. 
</P>
<P>
About one out of 10 people surveyed in Orange County said they or a member of 
their family had been intimidated by police, detained or arrested during a 
police sweep through the neighborhood, held without being charged with a crime, 
or had suffered another form of police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Most Orange County residents believe there are few problems involving police 
brutality. About one in six respondents in the poll said they believe there is 
"a fair amount" of police abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of those Orange County residents polled said they think relations 
between the community and police departments have remained steady or improved 
over the past decade. Only 13% said they believe they have worsened. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the Orange County people polled said they had some sort of 
contact during the last two years with police officers. Those contacts included 
people who were stopped by an officer and those reporting a crime or calling 
for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Chief Robertson said that police departments have recently tried 
to open themselves up, making their officers more visible and increasing 
contact with the public. He said his own department, for instance, has opened 
field offices and will soon be starting bicycle patrols. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want to be more visible than a patrol car," he said.

FAMILY FEUD: They're sister schools, but it isn't uncommon for one UC campus to 
covet another's staff, as evidenced by Berkeley's interest in Irvine's No. 2 
administrator, Chang-Lin Tien. . . . UCI evolutionary biologist Francisco 
Ayala, for example, was recruited from UC Davis. . . . But fear of too much 
bloodletting led UC system officials to circulate a secret memo a while back 
cautioning campuses against internecine bidding wars that would drive up 
salaries. . . . Tien, possibly the next UC Berkeley chancellor, may learn his 
fate when the regents meet Thursday. Dana Parsons

UCI REJECTS DEMAND BY STUDENTS;

<P>
CAMPUS HOUSING: ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT WON'T TAKE ANY OTHER ACTION NOW 
REGARDING ITS POLICY ON 'NON-TRADITIONAL' FAMILIES.

Students protesting a ban on housing "non-traditional" families and couples at 
UC Irvine delivered a letter to university officials Monday requesting an 
apology for "incorrect assertions" about the school's housing policy, but 
university officials rejected their demand. 
</P>
<P>
In a written response to the students, the administration said it was "not 
prepared to take any other actions at this time" to satisfy students who have 
been protesting the university's refusal to allow gay and lesbian and other 
"non-traditional families" to reside in campus family housing. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Olson, vice president for internal affairs of the Associated Graduate 
Students, said student protesters will occupy until Friday a cardboard 
"shantytown" constructed outside the administration building last week, and 
will reconstruct it "in a couple of weeks" if negotiations with the 
administration fail. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed," Olson said. "It's not really a response at all." 
</P>
<P>
In the students' letter, the Shantytown Committee and the Gay and Lesbian 
Student Union demanded that Chancellor Jack W. Peltason retract a statement he 
made last week saying that gay and lesbian couples never qualified for campus 
family housing and that he reinstate a trial housing policy that had been in 
effect since September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two short-term goals to which we expect an immediate response," the 
letter stated. "First, we respectfully request an apology to the (UC Irvine) 
community for your incorrect assertions about the 1989-90 Verano Exceptions 
Committee Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, we expect you to reinstate the definition of non-traditional family 
units outlined in Vice Chancellor (Horace Mitchell's memo of Feb. 15, 1989, per 
your original intent to address the needs of lesbian and gay couples for Verano 
family housing." 
</P>
<P>
The first demand refers to a Jan. 31 statement issued by Peltason to the campus 
community in which he said the university never had a policy exception that 
allowed homosexual or other unmarried couples to room in Verano Place, an 
860-unit apartment that currently houses at least three lesbian couples. 
</P>
<P>
"The policy has been and remains that housing is available only to students 
and, in the case of family housing, to students, their spouses and/or any of 
their dependent children," Peltason said in the statement. "Gay or lesbian 
couples living together in a domestic partnership or an unmarried heterosexual 
couple living together do not qualify for family housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriage is defined by public policy by the state, and that relationship is 
the only relationship that qualifies couples for family housing without going 
through the exceptions process," the statement continued. "This has been our 
policy and remains so." 
</P>
<P>
Student protesters said that statement contradicted the Feb. 15, 1989, memo 
from Mitchell detailing a pilot program that allowed exceptions to the housing 
policy based on financial or other hardships. The memo, in part, read: "It is 
possible for gay and lesbian couples (when one member is a non-student) to be 
considered under this procedure on a case-by-case, exceptional basis. However, 
the criteria do not include the recognition of a domestic partnership 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
The second demand in the letter sent to Peltason on Monday asks for the 
reinstatement of the exception procedure. Eleven non-traditional families -- 
including three lesbian couples, four sibling families, three students living 
with their parents and one extended family -- were accepted into Verano Place 
during the pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
In the response to the students Monday, Mitchell said that while the university 
regrets "that there has been some misunderstanding with respect to our housing 
policies and procedures," the administration is "not prepared to take any other 
actions at this time." 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that the response came from Vice Chancellor Mitchell," 
Olson said. "We'd like to see some sort of acknowledgment of our position from 
the chancellor himself." 
</P>
<P>
Peltason and Mitchell could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said students will hold a planning meeting Wednesday to discuss the next 
step in the demonstration. She said "the possibility of civil disobedience" was 
among the options to be discussed.

GIRL WOUNDED AT DISNEYLAND IS DOING WELL

<P>
An 8-year-old girl was reported to be in good condition Monday after being 
struck at Disneyland by a bullet that had apparently been fired from a nearby 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Nayeli Diana Placentia is expected to be hospitalized several days for a wound 
to her lower back. The Downey girl was hit by a large-caliber round on Sunday 
while riding the Disneyland Railroad in the Fantasyland section of the theme 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"She's alert and awake. She's doing real, real good," said Fran Tardiff, a 
spokeswoman for UCI Medical Center in Orange. "She's a good, quiet little girl 
and very cooperative, very pleasant." Anaheim police said Monday that they 
believe that the bullet was fired from outside the park, apparently into the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said the angle of the bullet's trajectory 
shows that it originated from the north to northwest, where Ball Road and West 
Street are located. But, he added, investigators may never know exactly where 
it came from because there is a heavy concentration of homes, hotels, motels 
and other businesses in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and police said Monday that it is not uncommon in that area for guns 
to be fired into the air, particularly on holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like firecrackers sometimes," said 15-year-old Efren Meraz, who 
lives on Michelle Drive behind the Disneyland Hotel. "There's a lot of gangs 
here, and they shoot guns in the air and in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said a bullet can travel upward as far as a mile, causing injury or 
even death when it plummets to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth said the train carrying Nayeli, her parents, Jose 
and Carmen Ramirez, and some other family members was pulling to a stop at 
Videopolis station shortly after 6 p.m. Sunday when she complained of a pain in 
her back. The station -- one of four along the rail route -- is near the "It's 
a Small World" attraction on the northern perimeter of the 80-acre park. The 
family had been riding in the last row of the last passenger car, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
After the girl's father told the ride operator that his daughter was 
complaining of pain in her back, a Disneyland nurse was summoned. The nurse 
noticed Nayeli Placentia was bleeding, Roth said, and park officials rushed her 
to Western Medical Center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors discovered Nayeli had been struck by a bullet, and she was transferred 
immediately to the trauma center at UCI Medical Center. The bullet was 
extracted during a 90-minute surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland Railroad was temporarily closed and the passenger car inspected. 
It was then that officials discovered a bullet hole in the red and white canvas 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
The ride reopened the same evening, and on Monday the canopy was replaced, Roth 
said. Park officials questioned passengers on the train, but none reported 
hearing a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said Disneyland has offered to assist in Nayeli's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we feel bad about their experience," Roth said. "It was a totally 
freakish accident. It (the bullet) could have landed anywhere. The poor child 
just happened to be there." Roth said this was the first incident involving a 
park patron being struck by a stray bullet, although there have been two 
homicides in Disneyland's 35-year history. A man was fatally stabbed during an 
argument in 1984, and another man was shot to death in the Disneyland parking 
lot in 1987.

COUNCIL TO VOTE ON GUN DEALER MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a month of discussions, the City Council is expected to vote 
tonight on an ordinance that would require local gun dealers selling 
concealable firearms to register with the Police Department and pay an annual 
$200 licensing fee. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 local gun dealers and gun owners protested the ordinance when it was 
last considered in January and the council decided to postpone a vote on the 
measure until it could be discussed among the interested parties. 
</P>
<P>
Many gun dealers argue that the licensing fee is too expensive, and that the 
city ordinance would be redundant because state and federal regulations already 
require gun dealers to be registered. 
</P>
<P>
The city proposed the ordinance earlier this year after the state attorney 
general issued an opinion recommending that local law enforcement agencies 
register businesses selling concealable firearms such as pistols and revolvers. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Sheriff's Department and the cities of Cypress and Fountain 
Valley have also decided to impose licensing fees in the wake of the attorney 
general's opinion.

WEAKEST QUADRUPLET REPORTED IMPROVED

<P>
A set of premature quadruplets progressed nicely during their third day of life 
Monday while enduring near-constant testing and intense scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
The weakest and smallest of the Miner infants, Jeffrey, improved with the help 
of a respirator that reduced the fluid in his lungs, but he remained in serious 
condition, UCI Medical Center spokeswoman Elaine Beno said. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's trouble arises from a fetal blood vessel that was not closed at 
birth, a condition that creates a carbon dioxide imbalance, Beno said. An 
oscillating respirator reduced the fluid in his lungs and he was switched over 
to an ordinary respirator Monday, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors were optimistic that medication can be used to close the vessel, but 
there was a 20% to 30% chance that surgery would be required, Beno said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey, who is housed in the intensive care section of the hospital's Infant 
Special Care Unit, was receiving an intravenous solution of glucose and 
electrolytes, Beno said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the hallway, his three siblings grew stronger, feeding on glucose and 
electrolyte solutions through tubes, Beno said. Jeffrey's brother, Vincent, and 
his two sisters, Brianna and Whitney, lay naked under warm, bright lights to 
help alleviate jaundice, a common newborn condition in which the skin and eyes 
take on a yellow cast. 
</P>
<P>
Wires taped to each of the four infants monitored their vital signs and doctors 
frequently pricked them to draw tiny blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Miner, 32, the Orange schoolteacher who bore the babies eight weeks early 
by Cesarean section at about 2:35 a.m. Saturday, was "very animated and upbeat" 
and felt well enough Monday to take a shower and stroll the hospital hallways, 
Beno said. Her 34-year-old husband, Al, a management consultant, alternated 
between visits to the nursery and to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, the new mother got her first chance to hold one of the babies, 
Beno said. She was elated as she cuddled Whitney, the biggest of the four. 
</P>
<P>
The couple declined interviews and photographs, sending word through hospital 
officials that they wanted to wait until Jeffrey improves further. 
</P>
<P>
The infants are the first set of quadruplets in Orange County, and the second 
in California, to be born through the fertility technique known as GIFT, gamete 
intra-Fallopian transfer. In that method, a woman's egg and a man's sperm are 
placed inside her Fallopian tube to allow conception to occur where it does 
naturally. 
</P>
<P>
In the Miners' case, four eggs were used to increase the chances that one would 
take. About one in 500,000 normal pregnancies results in quadruplets, UCI 
doctors said. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

MAN SHOT IN BACK DURING WALK IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old Los Angeles man was shot once in the back while walking Sunday 
night in Center Park. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Martinez was in stable condition Monday at Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana after undergoing surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez told police he was walking alone through the park, located in the 200 
block of South Center Street, when he heard a single gunshot and felt a sharp 
pain in his back. He called paramedics from a nearby phone booth about 7:20 
p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Martinez did not see or hear anyone he could link to the shot. 
There are no suspects in the case, Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always the possibility that it was a stray bullet," Thomas said. "We 
don't have much on this case." 
</P>
<P>
The park is surrounded mostly by businesses and by a few homes.

LABORER HIRING HALL WILL BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council today will consider plans to open a hiring hall for day 
laborers who now look for work each morning along East Chapman Avenue and 
surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the center will open March 26 in a trailer at McPherson Road and 
Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Start-up expenses for the project would total $95,000, in addition to hiring a 
resource-center supervisor and a senior administrative clerk to run the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Once the center is open, the city can begin enforcing two day-laborer 
ordinances passed last September. The laws prohibit day laborers from 
soliciting work on city streets and in parking lots, with maximum penalties of 
a $500 fine and a six-month jail sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The measures are intended to clear the streets of the laborers, mostly young 
Latino men seeking temporary work. Matching workers with employers will be the 
primary goal of the center, but city officials say they also plan to use the 
hall to refer workers to other community services such as English classes. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Nobrega, senior assistant to the city manager, said the city expects to 
match 60 to 80 workers a day with employers. 
</P>
<P>
The center is scheduled to operate from 6 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, 
and 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturdays. In order to discourage workers from lining 
up outside the office before opening, workers will participate in a lottery 
drawing to determine the order in which jobs are handed out. 
</P>
<P>
Employers can either call the center to list a job opening or can come to the 
center in person. Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach have also opened hiring centers 
for day laborers, and Dana Point has a telephone job bank for these workers.

DRUNK-DRIVING SUSPECT RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach man booked on suspicion of drunk driving after a collision 
that critically injured his passenger was released from County Jail on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were returning from a Greenpeace rally Saturday when the accident 
happened at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Whitaker, 24, who had borrowed a friend's 1989 Corvette, was driving 
about 60 m.p.h. when he apparently lost control of the car on Huntington Avenue 
at Utica Street, striking an oncoming car and five parked cars, Police Lt. Gary 
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitaker was taken to UCI Medical Center with head injuries, and transferred 
Sunday to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
His passenger, Kelly Ickes, 24, also of Huntington Beach, was also taken to UCI 
Medical Center, where she was in critical condition with three gashes on her 
head and a broken nose. She was released Monday in fair condition, but will 
require reconstructive facial surgery, said her sister, Lindsey Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had attended a 12:30 p.m. Greenpeace rally at the Lake Street 
lifeguard station. 
</P>
<P>
The rally drew a crowd of about 200 people, who listened to four speeches by a 
coalition of Los Angeles-based environmental groups. The speakers and pickets 
criticized the government's offshore oil drilling policy. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey Ickes said her sister, an accountant, is not a Greenpeace activist but 
is merely interested in the plight of Huntington Beach since a recent oil spill 
marred the popular stretch of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"She is always real busy working and doesn't have a lot of time to get involved 
in things," the sister said. "She was just there as a concerned resident." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsey Ickes did not know where her sister and Whitaker went after the rally.

<P>
CONTINUATION SCHOOL MEETING SET TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School District will hold a public hearing 
tonight on the proposed move of Wintersburg Continuation High School. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to relocate the school for students with behavioral or attendance 
problems has sparked considerable community opposition since it was announced 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
The school, now at Ocean View High School in Huntington Beach, would move to 
the campus of Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
Residents opposed to the plan say it would bring increased violence, crime and 
traffic to their area. But police and residents of the area around Ocean View 
say there have been no problems. 
</P>
<P>
"They are taking kids who weren't able to adjust in a high school setting and 
putting them back into a high school setting," resident Barbara Emerson said. 
"It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents distributed leaflets in the community this week urging residents to 
attend tonight's meeting. It begins at 7:30 p.m. at the school district 
headquarters, 10251 Yorktown Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The school board is expected to take a final vote on Feb. 27.

PARENTS AIM TO PRESSURE BOARD ON TEACHER CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: OCEAN VIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT TRUSTEES ARE BEING BLAMED FOR STALLED 
NEGOTIATIONS, AND FOUR OF THE FIVE ARE UP FOR REELECTION LATER THIS YEAR. 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Parents of children attending schools in the Ocean View School District are fed 
up with and fired up about the contract dispute between the district and its 
teachers' union -- and that could spell trouble for the school board. 
</P>
<P>
Stalled contract talks between the district and the Ocean View Teachers Assn. 
have spurred activism among parents who say that their children are being 
ignored while the district and the union battle it out. In turn, this activism 
has opened the floodgates for the wrath of parents frustrated by budget cuts 
and declining services. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these things are really affecting children, and parents are saying, 
'Hey, we've got to do something about it,' " said Sally Alvino, a parent on the 
advisory board of Marine View Elementary School. The first step, she added, 
will be taken tonight, when parents are expected to air their concerns at a 
public meeting of the Ocean View school board. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five members of the board are up for reelection, and although the 
election is nine months away, signs are surfacing that parents will express 
their displeasure in the voting booth. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have been on the school board for a long time, and the parents 
are feeling frustrated," said Marsha Sipkovich, who has three children in Ocean 
View district schools. 
</P>
<P>
Although teachers have recently enacted work slowdowns, such as refusing to 
participate in extracurricular activities without pay, parents continue to back 
them, arguing that such actions wouldn't be necessary if the teachers were 
adequately compensated. 
</P>
<P>
"Ocean View teachers are not paid comparably to other districts -- that's been 
documented," Sipkovich said. "I think parents want their teachers to be paid 
well so that morale will increase and that can translate into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Contract negotiations are deadlocked over salaries, health benefits, the use of 
state lottery funds earmarked for education and allocation of funds from the 
Proposition 98 school-funding initiative approved in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The district has proposed cutting its share of the total contribution to the 
union's health-maintenance organization, and is offering teachers a 5.5% 
average pay hike. The union is seeking full health benefits and a 9.3% average 
raise. Talks are scheduled to continue Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Parents say the contract dispute is just the latest in a series of problems 
afflicting the district in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (the contract dispute) was the capper," Sipkovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Alvino said parent activism began rising after teachers in the district said 
that they would not donate time to supervise extracurricular activities until 
the contract is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Sports, except for intramural contests during regularly scheduled class time, 
came to a halt when physical education teachers declined to coach after-school 
games. Science fairs in six schools are in jeopardy because science teachers 
have refused to help pupils outside of class. 
</P>
<P>
But, Alvino said, "the overall problem is one of priorities." 
</P>
<P>
Alvino and Sipkovich both cited the lack of elective courses for junior high 
school students in the district, noting that few schools offer classes in music 
or fine arts, or in computers, typing or other vocational skills. 
</P>
<P>
District officials and trustees acknowledge that the contract dispute has 
shifted some of the district's focus from education. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our children are being denied programs at this point in time, and I 
deeply regret that," said Carolyn Hunt, one of the four school board members up 
for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Monte McMurray, superintendent of the Ocean View School District, said that 
while the district would like to increase specialized programs such as computer 
training and music courses, financial problems have forced it to divert funds 
to more essential needs. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand the parents' concerns," McMurray said. "But it's a very 
delicate balance that the board of trustees has to make between employee 
demands and programs for students."

SOME REWARD: MATER DEI OPENS AGAINST SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Winning the Angelus League boys' soccer title didn't do Mater Dei High School a 
lot of good as far as the Southern Section 4-A playoffs are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs (15-6-2), who haven't lost since mid-December, clinched the league 
title with a 2-1 victory over Servite Thursday. Their reward is Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Although Santa Monica of the Bay League enters the playoffs as the third-seeded 
team, the Vikings were ranked among the division's top 10 teams most of the 
season. Two weeks ago, Santa Monica was ranked 10th in the 4-A poll. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs play the Vikings (16-9-2) Friday in a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs haven't lost in 12 games, but they haven't dominated opponents on 
the scoreboard either. In an earlier game against Servite, the Monarchs outshot 
the Friars, 19-2, but had to settle for a 1-1 tie. "We had a problem all season 
with finishing off shots," Coach Martin Stringer said. 
</P>
<P>
In other 4-A first-round games Friday: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (14-4-5) plays at Hawthorne (19-2-6), the fourth-seeded team, and 
Servite (10-10-4) is at Edison (13-5-5). 
</P>
<P>
Alta Loma (16-8-5) plays at Marina (14-6) in a wild-card game Wednesday. The 
winner plays at Don Lugo (15-4-6). 
</P>
<P>
In 3-A first-round games Thursday: 
</P>
<P>

(11-7-5); Los Altos (9-5-3) at Mission Viejo (13-6-5).

<P>
Santa Maria (9-9-2) plays at Cypress (16-4-3), the third-seeded team; Los

Pacifica (9-8-1) at Ganesha (17-4-1); Trabuco Hills (9-9-3) at Santiago 
(15-3-4); Bonita (6-10-5) at Brea-Olinda (13-7-2); Kennedy (11-7) at Laguna 
Hills (19-5). 
</P>
<P>
Orange (17-0-3), the only undefeated team in the section, is the top-seeded 
team in the division and has a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
In 1-A first-round games Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
Temple City (10-12-1) plays at Sunny Hills, the fourth-seeded team; Bosco Tech

(14-4-2); San Dimas at Sonora (7-10-3). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (6-12-3) plays at Estancia (9-2-3) today in a wild-card game. The 
winner plays at El Segundo (16-2-2) Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In small school first-round games Friday: 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (13-6-1) plays at Miraleste (16-3-0); Santa Margarita (10-7) 
at Temecula Valley (17-7-1). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (14-6-2) is the third-seeded team in the division and has a 
first-round bye.

COUNTY TEAMS HAVE A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW

<P>
It might be tough for girls' basketball teams in Orange County to match last 
season's playoff performances, but this year's crop of athletes might have the 
talent to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoying their most successful season ever last year, Orange County teams won 
three Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda won the 3-A championship, Katella the 4-A and Valencia the 4-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda captured the county's first state championship, the Division II 
title, and Katella, led by all-state guard Joni Easterly, made it to the state 
Division II final. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel was named player of the year in her division last 
season and La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia led the state in scoring with a 31.2 
average. 
</P>
<P>
While Easterly has gone to USC, some new faces have joined some of the familiar 
ones. Brea-Olinda (26-0), which has on a school-record 48-game victory streak, 
returns all-state players McDaniel, Tammy Blackburn, Jinelle Williams and Jody 
Anton. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia has raised her scoring average to 33.4 points and Edison's Debbie 
Fischer has set records for most three-point baskets in a game (10), season 
(92) and career (100). 
</P>
<P>
In 3-AA, top-seeded Brea-Olinda has a first-round bye and plays the winner of 
the game between Bassett (11-9) and El Dorado (7-13) on Saturday. In 4-A, 
top-seeded La Habra (19-3) plays the winner of Katella (9-15 and Garden Grove 
(11-11). In 3-A, top-seeded Rancho Alamitos (18-3) plays the winner of St. Paul 
(3-18) and Covina 9-14). 
</P>
<P>
Other county teams expected to perform well are Ocean View (24-0), which plays 
the winner of West Covina (19-4) and Hueneme (14-10); Woodbridge (20-4, which 
plays the Loara (13-10) and California (16-6) winner, and La Quinta (23-3, 
which plays the Buena Park (9-9) and Pioneer (10-12) winner.

STRONG FIELD MEANS THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES

<P>
As far as the coaches in the Southern Section 4-AA playoffs are concerned, 
nothing is assured. Not in this division, not this year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get two wins (in the playoffs), we'll consider it a great year," 
Glendora High School Coach Mike LeDuc said. 
</P>
<P>
An admirable goal, except that Glendora is the fourth-seeded team in the 
division. So confidence, even among the division's top teams, is not running 
high. 
</P>
<P>
There are 19 teams with winning records in the 4-AA. It's not a significant 
number, but, in a year when many playoff divisions have been watered down, the 
4-AA might be as tough as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
"There are six teams that are really, really good and another 12 that can be 
tough on a given night," Beverly Hills Coach Jasck Dyck said. "That's 18 teams 
that could conceivably win the title. It should be a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth, Dominguez is the top-seeded team in the division. The Dons 
(20-5) are quick and utilize a pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Dominguez is led by guards Jeffrey Rogers and Michael Whittiker. 
Rogers is averaging 15.2 points a game, Whittiker 12.3. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, which won the 4-A championship last season, also is well prepared 
for playoff pressure after playing a tough San Gabriel Valley League schedule. 
The Dons finished league play tied for second with Cerritos, which qualified 
for the 5-A playoffs. Both trailed Lynwood, the No. 1-seeded team in 5-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Compton, the second-seeded team in 4-AA, also didn't win its league title. 
Compton (18-6) finished second to Long Beach Poly in the Moore League. Long 
Beach Poly is the second-seeded team in 5-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Compton has four players who average in double figures -- Curtis Thomas (16.7), 
Calvin Curry (12.5), James Williams (11.7) and Darnell Patterson (11.6). 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty good at sharing the basketball," Compton Coach Curtis Knight. "In 
this division, it helps to be balanced. There are too many good teams." 
</P>
<P>
And there are a few players who stand out from the crowd. Rick Robison averages 
34.4 points a game and has scored 40 or more points in each of the last four 
games. David Harbour of Camarillo averages 27.7 points, including a 50-point 
performance. Jason Green of Bishop Amat averages 20 points a game despite being 
doubled-teamed most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But the teams on which these players belong are not considered among the best 
in the division. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not a lot of glamour guys among the top teams," LeDuc said. "It 
takes more than a super player to win a title." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo and Edison also are balanced teams that figure to do well in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (18-6), the third-seeded team in the division, has a strong 
defense and finished in a tie for first place in the South Coast League with 
Capistrano Valley. Offensively, the Diablos are led by Eric Cramer (15.5), but 
they have four others who average between seven and 11 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (17-8) also spreads the scoring around. Brandon Jessie and Bill 
Martineau average in double figures. Steve Thobe, Dan Lovelady and Tom Tyler 
each average seven points. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just balance that will make the Diablos and Chargers tough. Both 
teams prefer a slower pace, which could disrupt a team preferring a run-and-gun 
style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to take advantage of those helter-skelter teams," Mission 
Viejo Coach Bob Minier said. "Hopefully, we can make them play at our pace. If 
we play our game, I think we can beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
There is no question who is the favorite in the 4-A playoffs. Artesia stands 
head, shoulder and knee caps above the rest of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Pioneers such heavy favorites is 6-8 forward Ed O'Bannon, 
considered one of the best high school players in the nation. O'Bannon, who 
averages 24 points a game, is being recruited by nearly everyone with a 
collegiate basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon and Artesia routed Fullerton, 74-53, in a second-round game last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Six Orange County teams are in the 4-A. Kennedy (16-6) is the strongest of the 
county teams. 
</P>
<P>
4-AA PREVIEW 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION -- San Bernardino (now in 5-AA). 
</P>
<P>
TOP TEAMS -- Dominguez (20-3) and Compton (18-6). 
</P>
<P>
DARK HORSE -- Camarillo had seven players return from last season's team, which 
reached the quarterfinals. Camarillo had injury problems early in the season, 
but has won four of its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
BEST DRAW -- Dominguez. The Dons will not face a team with a winning record 
until at least the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
WORST DRAW -- Compton. In the first round, Compton plays Torrance. Torrance is 
led by Rick Robison, who has scored 40 or more points in each of his last four 
games. If Compton wins, it probably will face California, which was ranked in 
the top 10 most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
KEY PLAYERS -- Robison (Torrance), Jason Green (Bishop Amat), David Harbour 
(Camarillo) and Brandon Jessie (Edison). 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- The top two-seeded teams in the division did not win their league 
titles. Dominguez and Cerritos finished tied for second in the San Gabriel 
Valley League behind Lynwood, the top-seeded 5-AA team. Compton finished second 
in the Moore League behind Long Beach Poly, the second-seeded team in the 5-AA.

<P>
LAGUNA BEACH HOPES TO EXPERIENCE A TITLE FIRSTHAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KOLLEN LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Laguna Beach High School Coach Ed Bowen talks about his school's last 
Southern Section championship, his players listen. And smirk. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen coached the Artists past Santa Clara, 58-54, to win the Division 1-A 
title in 1962. That date draws smiles from his players, who probably consider 
1962 ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at me kind of funny when I talk about it," said Bowen, 57. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, though, the Laguna Beach players of 1989-90 might get to experience a 
championship firsthand. The Artists (19-5) are the top-seeded team in the 
Division 2-A playoffs, which open today with six first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ever get a team that goes to the CIF and plays in the L.A. Sports 
Arena, that's a once-in-a-lifetime experience," said Bowen, whose team has a 
first-round bye. "If Laguna Beach makes it again, we're very fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Two three-year starters, seniors Dain Blanton and John Trevino, also will have 
something to do with it. Blanton, a 6-foot-4 forward, averages 17.7 points. 
Trevino, a 5-11 guard, averages 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking height, Bowen said, his team relies on pressure defense and outside 
shooting. "A team that fast breaks is the one that can clear the boards," Bowen 
said. "We can't do that, but (we) do try and press and create havoc, steal the 
ball and go." 
</P>
<P>
After playing bigger schools throughout the season in the Pacific Coast League, 
Bowen said his team should be well-prepared for the playoffs. Laguna Beach (8-2 
in league), the league's only 2-A school, finished second behind Trabuco Hills 
(10-0). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a 2-A school tucked in with Trabuco Hills and Woodbridge, two teams that 
can really play basketball," Bowen said. "When I develop my team against those 
teams that play tough, aggressive basketball, it makes us a lot tougher." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, El Segundo (13-13) and Serra (12-11) enter postseason play with 
average records, but playing against larger schools in the Camino Real League 
makes them a threat. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach could meet another county team, Orange Lutheran, in the 
semifinals. The Lancers hope to take the extra step they missed last season, 
when they lost in the 2-A championship game to Santa Clara, 78-54. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Orange Lutheran (15-10 overall, 9-5 in Olympic League) has one of 
the division's top players in Daryl Cole, a 6-5 senior averaging 21.3 points 
and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
With every starter 6-2 or taller, second-seeded Valley Christian (19-5) will 
field one of the division's bigger teams. But Valley Christian's top scorer is 
the smallest starter, 6-2 guard Sam Sybesma, who averages 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
In 1-A, Southern California Christian (13-8) of the Arrowhead League plays host 
to Capistrano Valley Christian (8-15) in the first round. The Flames, coached 
by Mike Murphy, face a tough draw. They meet the winner of the Chadwick 
(16-8)-Glendale Academy (14-4) game and probably will have to beat top-seeded 
Mission Prep (16-4) to reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
2-A PREVIEW 
</P>
<P>
DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Santa Clara (now in 2-AA). 
</P>
<P>
TOP TEAMS -- Laguna Beach (19-5), Valley Christian (19-5), St. Joseph (16-7), 
Orange Lutheran (15-10). 
</P>
<P>
DARK HORSE -- Serra (12-11). 
</P>
<P>
BEST DRAW -- Laguna Beach has a bye in the first round, then meets the winner 
of L.A. Baptist (8-14) and Kern Valley (1-19). 
</P>
<P>
WORST DRAW -- After a first-round bye, Big Bear (15-7) must beat Bishop (14-9) 
and probably top-seeded Laguna Beach to reach the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
KEY PLAYERS -- Daryl Cole (Orange Lutheran), Scott Panfil (El Segundo), Sam 
Sybesma (Valley Christian), Dain Blanton (Laguna Beach), Kenny Davis (Serra) 
and Billy Simas (St. Joseph). 
</P>
<P>
NOTEWORTHY -- The division includes eight teams with below .500 records and 10 
teams that open with byes. Four teams (St. Bonaventure, Paraclete, Orange 
Lutheran and Notre Dame) that reached the quarterfinals last season return.

La Habra High School defensive tackle Dan Ledieff said Monday that he has 
orally committed to attend Cal State Long Beach next fall, and Servite 
offensive tackle Marc Lamb has committed to Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Ledieff, 6-feet-4 and 235 pounds, had 105 tackles and 12 sacks last season. He 
was a member of The Times' All-County second team. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, 6-6, 240, committed to Northern Arizona after visiting the campus last 
weekend. He also visited Idaho State. MIKE REILLEY

WESTENDORF LEADS ST.MARGARET'S INTO SMALL SCHOOLS PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Margaret's High School is the second-seeded team in the Southern Section 
Small Schools Division boys' basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Tartans (17-4) have 14 consecutive basketball victories dating back to 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
They are led by center Ryan Westendorf, who is averaging 25 points and 19 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
All four of the Tartans' losses came against 1-A schools and three were in the 
La Jolla tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just gotten several of our players out from football," Coach Rick Bauer 
said. "We had only had two practices with the entire team." 
</P>
<P>
Westendorf has been one of the most dominant players on the Small Schools level 
this season. However, the Tartans don't rely completely on him. Guard Dan 
Campaigne is averaging 17.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Orange County teams -- Claremont, California Lutheran and St. 
Michael's -- will compete in the Small Schools division.

SPI EARNINGS CLIMB 26% ON RECORD SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
SPI Pharmaceuticals said Monday that its earnings rose 26% last year on record 
revenue of $124 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa-based maker of prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals 
said net income for its fiscal 1989 year ended Nov. 31 was $12.9 million, 
compared to $10.2 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue was up 7% to $124 million, compared to $116 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
SPI attributed the gains to increased international sales, particularly in 
Mexico and Central America. For instance, the company said it had experienced 
an increased demand in Mexico for the injectable multivitamin Bedoyecta, which 
is used to treat people with a deficiency of Vitamin B complex. Sales of 
Bedoyecta, which is not sold in the United States, were up 59% in 1989 to $11.4 
million. Two antibiotics -- Anapenil and Alivin -- also saw an increase in 
sales in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, SPI's earnings were up 3.4% to $3.7 million, compared 
to $3.6 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. Revenue fell 
slightly to $35 million, from $36.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
SPI's stock was up 37.5 cents per share Monday to close at $8.875. 
</P>
<P>
About 89% of SPI's stock is owned by ICN Pharmaceuticals, a Costa Mesa-based 
drug company. SPI employs 1,638 people worldwide. GREGORY CROUCH

PACIFIC SCIENTIFIC POSTS NET EARNINGS OF $4.4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pacific Scientific Co. of Newport Beach posted net earnings of $4.4 million for 
fiscal 1989, contrasted with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the fiscal year ended Dec. 29 declined 6%, to $169.6 million from 
$180.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, net earnings totaled $1.6 million, contrasted with a 
loss of $4.1 million in the corresponding year-earlier period. The year-ago 
loss included $3.5 million of litigation expense and $1.2 million of 
restructuring expense. Profits reduced the total loss figure to $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter sales declined 9%, to $44.1 million from $48.5 million. However, 
the company said, after taking into account all product lines that have been 
sold or discontinued, the sales of continuing products in the fourth quarter of 
1988 and 1989 were approximately equal.

<P>
SURVEY: ORANGE COUNTY MAKES TOP 10 LIST OF HOTEL MARKETS. BUT EXPERTS WARN 
AGAINST PROLIFERATION.

<P>
What does Orange County have in common with Nashville, Cleveland, and 
Birmingham, Ala? 
</P>
<P>
No, they haven't all just hit the best or worst places to live list. 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator is a ranking among the 10 hottest hotel markets in the 
country released Monday by Laventhol &amp; Horwath, the accounting and 
consulting firm that follows the leisure industry. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, strong tourism and convention markets helped the area climb 
onto the list because room-demand in the hotel market here grew 8.2% last year, 
compared to 3.5% growth nationwide. Room-demand data measures how many patrons 
actually stayed in the county's hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The data measures hotel occupancy and room-demand in the Anaheim-Santa Ana 
statistical area, which includes all of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In numbers, the survey means that about 26,600 people stayed in hotel rooms 
every night last year in Orange County, compared to 24,580 the previous year, 
said Mark Lomanno, national research director with Laventhol &amp; Horvath in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The county's occupancy rate -- measuring the number of hotel rooms occupied -- 
was 69.3% last year, up from 67% in 1988. Nationally, the average occupancy 
rate hovers at 63.5%, Lomanno said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the county's room rates were up 2.8% last year, as well, to 
$64.56 from $62.79 the year before. That compares to a national average rate of 
about $56 last year, Lomanno said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to strong convention and tourism activity, Orange County "has the 
advantage of being perceived as 'different' than Los Angeles," Lomanno said. 
That's because "for people on the East Coast, it's like going to the West Coast 
without having to go to the sprawl associated with Los Angeles -- whether that 
perception is true or not." 
</P>
<P>
The survey measures hotel markets from two perspectives -- growth in 
construction and in lodging demand. Orange County showed increases in both, 
Lomanno said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are cities which will experience a construction boom or where demand is 
unusually strong and growing," said Lomanno, adding that Orange County is the 
only one out of the 10 that should experience both. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities that made the list include Dallas and Houston, Tex.; Jacksonville 
and Orlando, Fla.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; and the New York metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
There is a cautionary note for Orange County: a continuing proliferation of 
hotels could cause a glut. About 1,900 rooms were added last year to bring the 
county's total to 49,900 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason we reported it as an area to watch," Lomanno said. "So many 
hotels are being built, but they're also being absorbed very quickly."

<P>
JUNK BOND PIONEER FILING AFTER $100-MILLION DEFAULTS; 
</P>
<P>
PARENT OF BROKERAGE FIRMS ASKS PROTECTION

The parent of junk bond pioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said today it would 
file for federal bankruptcy court protection, capping the downfall of the Wall 
Street firm that pioneered use of high-risk bonds in financing the takeover 
boom that swallowed many well-known firms. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. said a staggering liquidity problem had 
resulted in defaults on about $100 million in loans and was threatening other 
defaults. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy law was expected to be approved by Drexel's board of directors later 
today, said a Drexel official. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph told employees on the firm's internal 
communications system that the parent company and certain subsidiaries will 
file with U.S. Bankruptcy Court today. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said in a statement that it "intends to engage in an orderly liquidation 
of its positions" in government securities, although it would remain in the 
exclusive club of primary dealers for Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street traders and other sources said Drexel was barely functioning today. 
</P>
<P>
Few companies were reported to be trading with the firm, which rose to 
prominence through the risky "junk" bonds that have also marked its downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel was also said to be transferring accounts for which the firm holds 
securities to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., which acquired Drexel's 
retail brokerage business last year. The accounts were said to be employee or 
employee-related and include all types of securities, including stocks and 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel today also voluntarily withdrew from making markets in 228 stocks traded 
over the counter through the National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The firm was able to maintain its duties as a specialist on the floor of the 
New York Stock Exchange when another firm, Speer, Leeds &amp; Kellogg, agreed 
to clear Drexel trades and guarantee their financial obligations. Drexel owns 
the specialist firm Pforzheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Drexel said in a statement that a Chapter 11 filing would exclude the 
broker-dealer subsidiary, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and Drexel Burnham 
Government Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Drexel statement sent the market in high-yielding junk bonds into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is going wild. It is all over the place," one junk bond trader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to talk about an end of an era?" said Joan Greenberg, a senior vice 
president for high-yield bonds at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "When you have a 
market as tentative as the high-yield market, the removal of any player has to 
have a negative effect." 
</P>
<P>
Junk bond prices fell two points to three points, or $20 to $30 per $1,000 of 
face value, following the news that Drexel's board would meet to vote on the 
bankruptcy matter. Prices fell by a similar amount Monday, when Drexel said it 
was seeking a major investor or merger partner in an effort to raise additional 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel blamed the bulk of its problems on the deteriorating market for 
high-risk, high-yield "junk" bonds that it helped to create in the 1980s under 
now-indicted executive Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel's announcement followed several days of marathon negotiations with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the New York 
Stock Exchange over how to prevent a financial panic over its troubles. 
</P>
<P>
The dire problems at the investment firm threaten confidence in the nation's 
financial markets because of Drexel's pre-eminence in the $200-billion junk 
bond market, which has been slumping since last fall when several companies 
failed to meet financing terms on their junk bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
The firm was also hammered by its decision to plead guilty to six felonies and 
pay $650 million to the government to settle federal charges related to insider 
trading and other offenses. Drexel was forced to restructure as part of a civil 
settlement with the SEC and has since cut its work force to 5,300 from 10,700. 
</P>
<P>
The firm last week began to shift cash to the strapped parent from its 
securities subsidiary, but the move alarmed officials at the Federal Reserve 
and the SEC, who feared it might weaken the subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said in a statement today in Washington that it had moved to protect 
the assets of the brokerage firm by barring the subsidiary from transferring 
net capital to the parent without prior, specific approval. 
</P>
<P>
"Inventory schedules and other detailed financial information submitted by 
Drexel Burnham Lambert indicate at this time the registered broker-dealer has 
positive net worth and remains in capital compliance," the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a statement saying it will 
"carefully monitor" Drexel's decision to liquidate its position in government 
securities in consultation with the government, Drexel's securities subsidiary 
and other market participants. 
</P>
<P>
The bank said Drexel was still designated as a primary dealer in government 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in Treasury securities said there is concern that by selling off its 
large portfolio Drexel will add supply to the market and depress prices -- 
pushing interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel was a sleepy, second-rank Wall Street firm before financial whiz-kid 
Milken turned it into the pioneer and dominant player in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Launched during the Depression by I. W. (Tubby) Burnham, the firm's roots go 
back even further through a predecessor, Drexel Firestone, a prestigious, 
old-line investment house that Burnham acquired in 1973. Lambert was added 
through a 1976 acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel Burnham had traditionally operated in the second tier of Wall Street 
houses. But its aggressive trading of commodities during the inflationary 1970s 
moved it closer to the top ranks and boosted its capital base. 
</P>
<P>
As the commodities business cooled during the 1980s, Drexel sought to 
diversify. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, known for working long hours and for his spellbinding speeches to 
clients, led Drexel's march into the business of issuing high-risk bonds to 
finance new businesses. Companies having trouble raising funds through 
traditional channels were also sought as clients. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the boom in corporate takeovers that provided the big boost to 
Drexel's junk bond business. Drexel forged alliances with corporate raiders 
like Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn and others. 
</P>
<P>
But in November, 1986, Boesky agreed to pay $100 million to settle insider 
trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also 
agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge and cooperate in the government 
probe.

Detectives are circulating photographs of an "extremely dangerous" parolee 
suspected of brutally stabbing an 18-year-old high school student in a motel 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Roberta Marie Mosenthiem was found by a maid at the Chateau Motel, 
6719 Sepulveda Blvd., about noon Monday, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The student at the continuation Jack London High School had been stabbed 
repeatedly, Detective Jim Vojtecky said. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Michael Rowland, 21, an acquaintance of the victim, was wanted for 
questioning, Vojtecky said. Rowland, a transient who has lived in Camarillo and 
Lancaster, should be considered "extremely dangerous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland was released on parole two months ago from the California Institution 
for Men at Chino after serving four years for assault, under jurisdiction of 
the California Youth Authority and later as an adult, police said.

Workers who have given years of loyalty to their employers are being stripped 
of retirement benefits by "a stampede of corporate greed," the chairman of a 
Senate panel investigating "pension raids" said today. 
</P>
<P>
"All over this country companies have been terminating (pension) plans to get 
at the money without regard to the retirement security that has been promised 
to millions of workers and retirees," said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), 
chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee's labor panel. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing focused on firms in Kansas and California whose owners turned over 
pension funds to First Executive Corp., a financially troubled, Los 
Angeles-based insurance company invested heavily in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying at the hearing, employees of both Coleman Co. of Wichita, Kan., and 
Pacific Lumber Co. of Scotia, Calif., said the reported instability of First 
Executive raised fears that they would lose their pensions or at least 
cost-of-living increases.

A total of 23,896 Californians have been determined as having full-blown cases 
of AIDS since 1981, and 15,120 have died, the state Department of Health 
Services announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Releasing its year-end report for 1989, the department's Office of AIDS said 
the number of reported AIDS cases rose in California by 12.5% last year, while 
the number of reported AIDS deaths increased by 26.9%. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are still climbing," said Rene Durazzo, director of public policy 
for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which provides food and counseling to 
patients with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not see the statistics at this point that show us any relief is in 
sight," Durazzo said in a telephone interview. "It will only get much, much 
worse before it gets better."

BULGARIA REJECTS FORMER KING'S OFFER TO COME BACK FROM EXILE

The Communist government today rejected an offer by Bulgaria's former king to 
return from exile and help rebuild the country, suggesting the monarch should 
mind his own business. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no room for the revival of monarchist ideas in Bulgaria's public 
life," the government said in a statement carried by the Communist Party 
newspaper Rabotnichesko Delo. 
</P>
<P>
The statement rejected former King Simeon II's offer to use his international 
business and political connections to help revitalize Bulgaria's economy. 
</P>
<P>
It said the proposals are "strange and absolutely unacceptable, as are the 
attempts to advise the Bulgarian people about the way they should manage their 
affairs." 
</P>
<P>
Simeon II, who as a child briefly served as Bulgaria's last monarch before 
being exiled in 1946, made the proposals in an interview broadcast Sunday night 
on state television. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented television appearance from his home in Madrid gave many 
Bulgarians their first glimpse of the 53-year-old former king, who was forced 
to leave the country at age 9 when the Communists seized power.

BUSH MAY PROPOSE DRUG WAR 'RADAR NET' 
</P>

<P>
President Bush is likely to propose at the upcoming drug summit that U.S. ships 
be used to provide an offshore "radar net" to help Colombia interdict drug 
traffickers, a top aide said today. 
</P>
<P>
National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said the proposal has been "on the 
shelf" since Colombian officials balked at news reports that the United States 
was considering a naval "blockade" of their ports. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have denied they ever planned a blockade, calling use of the 
term unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, meanwhile, signed a new U.N. compact to help curb international drug 
traffic and urged other nations to do the same, "to join us in working together 
to rid the world of this menace, the menace of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Convention Against Illegal Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, adopted in 
Vienna in December, 1988, calls upon all nations to make illegal the 
production, cultivation and transportation of narcotic and other dangerous 
drugs. It also calls for tighter controls of chemicals used in drug production 
and sets up guidelines for extraditing drug offenders, seizing drug-tainted 
assets and curbing money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate ratified the agreement last November. The United States is the fifth 
of 76 signatories to the convention to ratify it. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, Scowcroft told a White House briefing on Thursday's four-nation drug 
summit in Cartagena, Colombia, that the United States never planned a naval 
blockade but wanted "to provide a radar net and give the Colombians a better 
indication" of air traffic that might be involved in drug trading. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an idea we think has merit," Scowcroft said. "I expect it might be 
discussed" at the Cartagena meeting among Bush and the presidents of Colombia, 
Peru and Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to push the use of U.S. military forces where they're not 
needed or wanted," Scowcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the radar screen would be confined to equipment on U.S. naval ships 
cruising off the coasts of Colombia, and would not entail any land-based 
U.S.-manned radar installations. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, sources said today that the United States has sent 
the amphibious assault ship Nassau and its 1,900 Marines off the coast of 
Colombia in preparation for Bush's trip to the Andean drug summit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tarawa-class assault ship, accompanied by a destroyer, left its home port 
of Norfolk, Va., Feb. 5 "for routine training operations in the South 
Atlantic," the U.S. Atlantic Command said. However, defense sources speaking on 
condition they not be identified said the Nassau and the destroyer were sent to 
waters off Colombia as part of U.S. preparations for Bush's trip Thursday to 
Cartagena. 
</P>
<P>
"They're there mainly for logistics purposes. But, of course, if anything 
happens, they would be prepared," one defense official said of the Nassau.

Thieves smashed through a SoHo gallery's front door today and snatched $750,000 
worth of art works -- including nine oil paintings and drawings by LeRoy Neiman 
-- in a lightning-fast pre-dawn heist, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The burglars broke through glass panels in the double doors at Dyansen Gallery, 
hot-wired an electronic operated steel security gate and made off with the 
artworks in less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A gallery official said a Neiman drawing of TV's David Frost was among the 
loot. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the paintings and drawings by Neiman, whose paintings often 
depict famous people at play, the thieves made off with six other paintings and 
four sculptures, said a Dyansen official. The stolen works were valued at about 
$750,000 by the gallery.

Three suspected members of a Communist death squad shot and killed the mayor of 
a town just outside Manila today, the military reported. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Felino Maquinay of Carmona died on the spot with three bullet wounds in 
the head, said Capt. Romeo Gullas, provincial operations chief of the 
Philippine Constabulary. 
</P>
<P>
Three unidentified youths, believed to be members of the Communist New People's 
Army, approached Maquinay as he was having lunch and opened fire at close range 
with pistols, Gullas said. 
</P>
<P>
Maquinay's bodyguard and his driver, too surprised by the attack to protect 
him, were unharmed, Gullas added. The gunmen fled in a commandeered car.

Filofax, the British company that makes personal organizers for yuppies, has 
been hit hard by a shopping slump and fading demand from business executives. 
</P>
<P>
The paperback-sized binder, patented over 50 years ago by a shorthand typist, 
won commercial success in the 1980s as a vital accessory for "yuppies" -- young 
upwardly mobile professionals. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of its success, Filofax Group PLC hailed the files, sold in more 
than 30 countries, as "one of the great marketing phenomena of the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
But poor retail sales in Britain, the firm's biggest market, and a flood of 
cheaper imitations have wiped out profits. Filofax Chairman David Collischon 
said today that the company expects to record a loss for the second half of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Collischon said the company is partly a victim of its own success as the 
executive market that helped cause the Filofax boom is now well supplied with 
the built-to-last binders.

The Federal Aviation Administration today tentatively ordered changes in the 
control panels of Boeing 737s to prevent a rudder control problem that is one 
focus of an accident hearing under way in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would make it less likely that pilots or cockpit visitors might 
accidentally move a rudder trim control knob that could reduce the pilot's 
ability to control the plane or force an aborted takeoff, the FAA said. 
</P>
<P>
The work would be relatively simple and cost about $820 per plane, the FAA said 
in issuing a proposed airworthiness directive. The directive would become final 
after a 60-day period for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The order came as the National Transportation Safety Board opened a four-day 
hearing in New York City into the Sept. 20 crash of USAir Flight 5050 that 
killed two people. The plane skidded off the end of the LaGuardia Airport 
runway into the East River and broke into several pieces in an aborted takeoff, 
and investigators are examining a possible rudder control problem.

RENEWED CAR REBATES HELP DRIVE UP RETAIL SALES 1.6% IN JANUARY

<P>
Retail sales driven by renewed automobile sales incentives climbed 1.6% in 
January, the steepest increase in more than a year, the government reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales increased to a seasonally adjusted $146.4 
billion after declining a revised 0.2% in December during what analysts 
described as modest holiday shopping. 
</P>
<P>
The January gain was the sharpest since a 2.1% advance in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer spending is still alive," said John Silvia, an economist with Kemper 
Financial Services in Chicago. Most categories showed advances that "suggest to 
me that the consumer is coming back in the first quarter, taking up his normal 
pace of spending." 
</P>
<P>
December sales originally had been reported to have gained 0.2%. A drop in 
estimated auto sales accounted for the decline. Overall sales in November rose 
0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing usually slows in January because of the previous month's activity. 
Half or more of retail profits come from business between Thanksgiving and 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and 
thus are a barometer of economic growth. The economy, particularly the 
construction and manufacturing sectors, has been squeezed by high interest 
rates as the Federal Reserve kept a tight rein on credit to cap inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry, slowed by the high rates and rising prices on 1990 
models, reinstituted rebates on many models last month to lure buyers to dealer 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce said auto sales gained 5.4% in January after falling 2.6% in December. 
It was the largest advance since a 6.6% increase in October, 1988. Autos 
represent about 20% of retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding autos, retail sales for the month would have risen 0.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The overall durable goods category -- including cars and other big-ticket items 
expected to last more than three years -- gained 3.9% after declining 2.1% in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Building materials advanced 2.3%, while furniture and other home furnishings 
rose 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of non-durable goods such as food and clothing edged up 0.3%.

The paper industry announced today that it is setting a goal of 40% paper 
recycling by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cavaney, president of the American Paper Institute, said "it will require 
the cooperation of the public sector and the participation of tens of millions 
of citizens in order to expand collection systems." 
</P>
<P>
With total paper use expected to be just over 100-million tons by 1995, that 
would represent a recycling goal of 40-million tons, according to figures 
supplied by the institute, the trade association for makers of pulp, paper and 
paperboard. 
</P>
<P>
That much recycling would represent an increase of more than 50% from the 
26-million tons recycled in 1988, the institute reported. 
</P>
<P>
Cavaney said the industry will establish a computerized system to help 
communities that undertake recycling programs find markets for the paper they 
collect.

'BLIND FAITH' KEEPS NBC ON TOP 85TH WEEK

<P>
NBC had faith -- the first half of the miniseries "Blind Faith" on Sunday night 
-- to help it stay on top for the 85th week out of the last 86, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting thing happened to the networks on the way to the ratings war on 
Sunday -- during the two-hour movie window, they had a combined audience share 
of 78%, considerably higher than the 69% they usually average. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three competing shows -- "Blind Faith" on NBC (ranking 8th in the 
listings) and the terrifying "Miracle Landing" on CBS (24th) -- were based on 
real happenings. The theatrical film "Robocop" (23rd) was the ABC entry. 
</P>
<P>
Two other docudramas were less widely watched. The second installment of CBS' 
miniseries, "Family Of Spies," tied for 36th on Tuesday, which is pretty good 
for CBS on a Tuesday. NBC's "Murder in Mississippi" came in 50th, which is not 
good for an NBC Monday movie. 
</P>
<P>
There were two new series bowing in last week -- "Elvis" on ABC and "The 
Bradys" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis," in its special premiere slot following "Roseanne," tied for 20th -- a 
considerable drop from its third-place lead-in. When "Elvis" moved into its 
regular Sunday slot, it dropped to 47th, down precipitously from its lead-in, 
"America's Funniest Home Videos," which again made the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the ratings race for the week ending Feb. 11 with a 14.7 rating and a 
24 share, according to the A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC took second place with a 13.2 
rating and a 21 share, while CBS was third with a 12.5 rating and a 20 share. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-week-old season-to-date ratings show NBC with a 14.8 rating and a 25 
share, ABC with a 13.0 rating and a 22 share, and CBS with a 12.3 rating and a 
20 share.

STING, SPRINGSTEEN, HENLEY JAM FOR RAIN FORESTS

<P>
Some Hollywood heavies paid $5,000 to hear Sting perform on the same stage as 
Bruce Springsteen and Don Henley. Others in the know forked out just $10 -- and 
they got to see the music giants jam together. 
</P>
<P>
After a pricey Beverly Hills back-yard benefit that raised more than $1 million 
to save Amazon rain forests Monday night, Sting, Springsteen and Henley 
gathered at the China Club in Hollywood, publicist Joe D'Ambrosio said. 
</P>
<P>
In the audience of about 400 during the 45-minute performance were basketball 
legend Wilt Chamberlain, raunchy comedian Sam Kinison, actors Richard Grieco, 
Corey Haim and Ed Begley Jr., and Julian Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
Other notables included Brian Setzer, singer Michael Damien, actor Esai 
Morales, Patti Scialfa and California Angels rookie pitching sensation Jim 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
The recording superstars took the stage during the club's twice-weekly Pro-Am 
Invitational Jam. Unlike the earlier benefit show, the club show featured all 
three on stage together, along with Herbie Hancock, Branford Marsalis, Bruce 
Hornsby and Joe Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen sang "(I'm Gonna Wait) Till the Midnight Hour," Sting sang "Ain't 
No Sunshine" and "I Been Down So Long," while all three took a turn leading a 
rendition of "Round and Round." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets at the exclusive benefit for the Rainforest Foundation, attended by 
industry figures like Disney's Michael Eisner and celebrities like Barbra 
Streisand, went for between $5,000 and $500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The cover charge at the club known for its big-name celebrity walk-ons was $10, 
with no drink minimum.

Now Michelle Pfeiffer will be roaming the back roads around Raleigh to shoot a

<P>
The actress will begin filming "Love Field" in April. Her recent screen credits 
include "The Fabulous Baker Boys," "Dangerous Liaisons" and "Married to the 
Mob." 
</P>

The story involves the "strong emotional relationship" among Pfeiffer's 
character and a father and daughter she meets on a bus trip as she is traveling

Midge Sanford said. The movie takes its name from the Dallas airport where the

Traci Lords and Brook Yeaton can say, truly, that theirs is a relationship 
right out of a John Waters movie. 
</P>
<P>
Lords, 21, a one-time teen porn queen, will marry Yeaton, 22, the prop master 
on her latest movie. 
</P>
<P>
The couple met in Baltimore last year while filming the John Waters' movie, 
"Cry-Baby," which is slated for national release April 6. 
</P>
<P>
Lords -- part of an eccentric cast that includes Patty Hearst, Johnny Depp and 
Polly Bergen -- plays a high school virgin in the film. Yeaton also was prop 
master for Waters' last film, "Hairspray." 
</P>
<P>
Lords gained notoriety in 1986 when it was discovered that she had appeared in 
pornographic movies as a minor. She has since been acting in mainstream films.

The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who once battled to keep Jim Bakker away from PTL, says 
the 45-year prison sentence given to the fallen television evangelist is too 
harsh. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt a debt to society had to be paid, but 45 years is unreasonable," 
Falwell said Sunday night before preaching at Calvary Church. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Potter sentenced Bakker in October for defrauding 
followers who had sent him $158 million in exchange for lodging guarantees at 
PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat in nearby Ft. Mill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Falwell took over at PTL after Bakker's March, 1987, resignation in a sex and 
money scandal involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn. Falwell resigned 
six months later, after Bakker announced he wanted to return to the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody here -- including the court -- just got caught up in the 
spectacular nature of what was going on," Falwell said.

LIZ SMITH: MONEY CAN'T BUY LOVE -- JUST ASK SALLY AND AGA

THE AGAS go gaga! Remember Sally Croker Poole, the beautiful former model who 
became the wife of the fabulously rich Aga Kahn, spiritual leader of 12 million 
Ismaeli Muslims, 20 years ago? Now all of Europe is abuzz with the story that 
Sally and the Aga Kahn are on the verge of divorce. 
</P>
<P>
The Begum, once regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world, spent 
her recent 50th birthday alone in Switzerland. Her three children, ages 19, 18 
and 15, are in school or traveling. As for the Aga, he spends his time, as he 
has for the past five years, with gorgeous Pilar Goess, a 32-year-old Austrian 
model. The Aga sees his wife only when he must make an official appearance 
before his followers. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected there will be a quiet divorce in the not-too-distant future. 
Whether Pilar, who sports a $1-million pink diamond on her left hand, will 
become the next Begum, is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
BRYANT GUMBEL of the "Today" show is certainly stepping out into public life. 
Last week he appeared at the big Council of Fashion Designers fashion tribute 
in New York and gave out an award. Now comes word that Bryant will be master of 
ceremonies on June 2, when the Friars Clubs pay tribute to Diana Ross as 
Entertainer of the Year. This event happens at the Waldorf Astoria in New York, 
and the lure of Ross is expected to pack the place to the rafters. The occasion 
will also mark the 85th anniversary of the New York Friars Club. 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL WINNER, the director, persuaded that wonderful British actor John 
Cleese to put in an unbilled guest appearance in Winner's upcoming "Bullseye," 
which stars Michael Caine and Roger Moore. He came upon Cleese quite 
unexpectedly in Barbados, where "Bullseye" was wrapping production and where 
Cleese vacations every year. I guess basking in the sun on the beach in 
Barbados lowers an actor's resistance. 
</P>
<P>
ADVANCE WORD on "State of Grace," Phil Joanou's movie based on the Westies gang 
and Gambino family, is that the film will hit very close to home and pull no 
punches in its shocking tale of murder and terror in New York's Hell's Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The movie has a knockout cast that includes Ed Harris, Gary Oldman and Sean 
Penn. "State of Grace," which filmed in New York City under unusually tight 
security, opens this summer. 
</P>
<P>
PERHAPS LESLEY-ANNE Down won't be able to lift "Dallas" back to its glory days 
of ratings supremacy, but for now, at least, the British beauty is adding some 
much needed spice and glamour to the granddaddy of nighttime soaps. Down looks 
ravishing -- better than she has for some time -- and she's quite effective 
playing a high-powered PR woman. She comes off like a softer version of Joan 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
And "Dallas" has more good news. They've invited the divine Alexis Smith back 
to reprise her role as that very soigne madwoman, Lady Jessica. (She kidnaped 
and attempted to murder Miss Ellie a few seasons back.) Well, maybe "Dallas" 
will make a ratings comeback, now that it has all this delicious womanpower 
behind it.

James (Buster) Douglas became undisputed heavyweight champion today, three days 
after knocking out Mike Tyson, amid reports that a Tyson-Douglas rematch is set 
for June 18 in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who knocked Tyson out in the 10th round early Sunday in Tokyo, 
received recognition from the World Boxing Assn. The World Boxing Council 
recognized his victory Monday night, after Tyson's promoter-adviser, Don King, 
dropped his protest. 
</P>
<P>
The International Boxing Federation already had recognized Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
"I never asked anybody to change the decision," King said Monday night in his 
first comments since the knockout of Tyson. "We just want a first shot at a 
rematch." 
</P>
<P>
There may be a hitch, though. Evander Holyfield, who had a contract to fight 
Tyson on June 18 if Tyson was heavyweight champion, still is the No. 1 
contender of the WBC, WBA and IBF. A Douglas-Holyfield fight, therefore, may be 
mandated. 
</P>
<P>
King and Tyson were scheduled to hold a news conference late this afternoon in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, billionaire Donald J. Trump told the New York Times: "We made 
the deal a little while ago" to host a Tyson-Douglas rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Selesner, vice president of operations at Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, 
told The Press of Atlantic City that the casino owned by Trump will host the 
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Selesner was not immediately available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dan Duva, who promotes Holyfield, said: "Right now, everything is in 
the talking stages, and negotiations are going on, but nothing is firm. The 
only thing firm is that Evander Holyfield is the mandatory challenger for 
Buster Douglas." 
</P>
<P>
Duva said he had been conducting negotiations with King about several 
possibilities, "and that is one of them, but nothing has been agreed upon, and 
I told Gary Selesner that this morning" 
</P>
<P>
James Binns, legal counsel for the WBA, told the Associated Press this morning: 
"The WBA has declared Buster Douglas the champion. It's just upon reflection 
that this is the right decision. There are no conditions regarding a title 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
Binns said the decision was made after consulting this morning with WBA 
President Gilberto Mendoza, who was still in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll meet with him tomorrow (Wednesday), and after that we may conduct a press 
conference," Binns said. 
</P>
<P>
WBC President Jose Sulaiman said his organization was not withholding title 
recognition of Douglas, as he had indicated earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said Monday night he was misunderstood in his comments about the 
possibility of not recognizing Douglas, and, in fact, his organization is 
unanimous in its belief that Douglas should be crowned. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted the members of the executive council of the WBC in the five 
continents, and they demand our group officially announce Buster Douglas as 
champion of the world of the heavyweight division," Sulaiman said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said today a rematch would be fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be more than willing to fight Mike Tyson," he said on ABC-TV's "Good 
Morning America," adding: "I did it once. I'll do it again."

REFEREE DEFENDS DISPUTED LONG COUNT OVER DOUGLAS

Referee Octavio Meyran today defended his handling of the eighth-round count 
over James (Buster) Douglas in his heavyweight title bout with Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Meyran said there was no need to refer to the timekeeper in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
"He won the championship fair and square," Meyran said of Douglas in an 
interview with the Mexican television network Televisa. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas knocked out Tyson in the 10th round in Tokyo on Sunday in a stunning 
upset, but promoter Don King and Tyson argued that Douglas was saved by a long 
count when he was floored in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas was felled by a punch, and what I did was make the count without 
looking to the timekeeper outside the ring. With 22 years of experience and 30 
world title fights, I think I have the ability to do that," Meyran said. "I 
prefer not to depend on someone at the edge of the ring who is only doing a 
count." 
</P>
<P>
"The rules don't say you have to look to the timekeeper. Of course, you can 
look for his help." 
</P>
<P>
King withdrew his protest Monday night but again said Meyran made a mistake. 
Meyran said there was no error. 
</P>
<P>
"At the count of eight, Douglas started to get up and I saw that he knew what 
was going on. He lifted his head, hit the canvas in a sign of disgust, which 
told me he was ready to continue the fight," Mey-ran said 
</P>
<P>
"The time was up and possibly Tyson would have won, but Douglas demonstrated 
that he was well-prepared in the next round. 
</P>
<P>
"Douglas was well-prepared physically. His punches were always good and he 
stood up to everything Tyson threw."

SINGLE GERMAN OLYMPIC TEAM POSSIBLE IN 1992

A top East German sports official has acknowledged for the first time that the 
two Germanys may be in a position to combine their powerful sporting talents 
into one team before the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that things will happen so fast that a joint team could come 
about by 1992, perhaps even earlier," East German National Olympic Committee 
Vice President Georg Zorowka said at a World Cup swimming meet in Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
Zorowka is a top figure in East German swimming, a sport that would be 
revolutionized by a joint German team. 
</P>
<P>
He added today that the decision will depend on the outcome of elections in 
East Germany next month. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we sports people can only decide as voters in political 
elections. I believe we have to go carefully with such developments," Zorowka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The elections are to decide a future government for the former communist state, 
whose power crumbled after a peaceful people's uprising late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for political unification of the two countries are picking up pace by the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
West German Olympic chief Willi Daume said a few days earlier that 
International Olympic Committee officials will not stand in the way of a 
combined German team and that it may happen in time for the Barcelona Games.

A West Chester University basketball coach remained hospitalized today with 
injuries he sustained when fans stormed the court in the final seconds of a 
game with Cheyney University. 
</P>
<P>
Violence erupted at Cheyney's Cope Hall at 10 p.m. Monday in the final seconds 
of the game, with Cheyney leading 67-66. 
</P>
<P>
A West Chester player intentionally fouled a Cheyney player, and the Cheyney 
fans went wild. 
</P>
<P>
State police in Avondale said many Cheyney fans charged onto the floor and 
started punching and kicking West Chester players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were taken to the hospital, but four were released after treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Driscoll, 34, West Chester assistant coach, remained in Riddle Memorial 
Hospital in stable condition with a concussion and possibly other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One player needed nine stitches above his eye. Another had a possible spinal 
injury. West Chester trainer Tom Gannon, 19, of Brook Haven sustained a 
possible cheekbone fracture. 
</P>
<P>
The game was suspended and state police were called in to clear the gym. There 
were no arrests and the investigation was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Delaney, West Chester head coach, has called for Cheyney to forfeit the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyney and West Chester officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Tod Eberle, commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference, said 
Cheyney's remaining league home game scheduled for Wednesday with Millersville 
probably would be moved to a neutral location. 
</P>
<P>
A non-league game with Lincoln University is scheduled for Cheyney's home court 
on Monday, but Eberle said that game would not be moved. 
</P>
<P>
Eberle said NCAA rules address fighting among players but not among fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any players got ejected," Eberle said. "I think all hell broke 
loose and a lot of fans got involved. That wouldn't come under the NCAA rules."

FATHER, SON TAKE AIM AT PARALYSIS

"Your son will never walk again." 
</P>
<P>
Those words hit Nick Buoniconti harder than any blocker ever had in his seven 
years as linebacker for the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke down and cried," said Buoniconti, recalling that tragic day, Oct. 26, 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that went through my mind was, 'How am I going to tell my wife 
that our son is a quadriplegic?' " 
</P>
<P>
Marc Buoniconti, then 19 and a linebacker for The Citadel, dislocated his neck 
while making a tackle against East Tennessee State. It looked like a routine 
tackle, the kind he had made many times before, but this play changed his life, 
leaving him paralyzed from the neck down. 
</P>
<P>
The Buonicontis were in Washington, D.C., the other day to raise money for the 
Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. Marc, now 23, is spokesman and ambassador for 
the campaign that his father helped start after Marc's injury. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 500,000 with paralysis in the United States. In 1990, an 
estimated 14,000 more will be paralyzed. Most common causes of spinal injuries? 
Auto accidents, sporting accidents and gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Once paralysis was thought of as irreversible, but a possible cure is on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
"Recent findings in cell biology and nerve biology do show that the central 
nervous system has some capacity for repair," said Dr. Susan Fitzpatrick, 
director of education and patient relations at the Miami project. 
</P>
<P>
When Marc was crippled, it lit a fire in his father, who, throughout his 
playing career, was known for beating the odds. 
</P>
<P>
Told he was too small to play middle linebacker in the NFL, the older 
Buoniconti excelled and helped the Dolphins to two Super Bowls in the early 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
Told his son would never walk again, Buoniconti set out again to beat the odds. 
He gave up his high-paying job as president of U.S. Tobacco to work full time 
as a fund-raiser for the Miami project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go anywhere, do anything, talk to anybody to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
That never-say-die spirit has been passed on to the son. After the accident, 
Marc went from 210 pounds to 130 in five months. He could breathe only with the 
use of a respirator. Now, he is off the respirator and getting stronger. 
</P>
<P>
"My muscles are getting stronger, my bones are stronger and I breathe better," 
Marc said. 
</P>
<P>
"They really are motivated," Fitzpatrick said. "They keep our spirits up. They 
want to get out of those chairs and are very willing to work. They really are a 
source of inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
A senior at the University of Miami, Marc said he "felt very sad" when he heard 
about Chuckie Mullins (Mississippi) and Jeff Fuller (San Francisco 49ers), 
football players paralyzed last year. "I know what they're going through." 
</P>
<P>
But Marc is not bitter about football. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things happen. Every time you step on the field, you know there's that 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Emotion creeps into his voice as he talks about his dashed hopes of playing in 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have loved to have given it a shot, but it was taken away from me and 
I'll never get that chance again. I feel bad about that, but I'm getting along, 
moving along, doing other things now."

CRITIC AT LARGE: 'SAMMY' KEEPS ON RUNNING; NEXT AS A MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Technically, Budd Schulberg's "What Makes Sammy Run" is just entering its 50th 
year, having been published in the spring of 1941. Its publisher, Bennett Cerf 
of Random House, loved it but was confident it would fail. Hollywood novels 
didn't sell, and Nathanael West's "Day of the Locust," published the year 
before, had not earned back the $500 advance West received. 
</P>
<P>
Cerf promised Schulberg a dinner at the 21 club if the book took off. He and 
Schulberg ate at 21 a lot, because the book's portrait of a brash, ruthless, 
amoral hustler from the Lower East Side, rising from teen-age office boy at a 
newspaper to Hollywood mogul, caught the national fancy. 
</P>
<P>
Hedda Hopper snarled "How dare you!" at Schulberg in a Hollywood restaurant. At 
a Motion Picture Assn. board meeting, Louis B. Mayer cried that Schulberg 
should be deported. The author's father, producer B.P. Schulberg, said, "Louie, 
he's the only novelist who ever came from Hollywood. Where the hell are you 
going to deport him, Catalina Island?" But the elder Schulberg also thought his 
son was finished in Hollywood and asked, "How will you live?" 
</P>
<P>
John Wayne saw the book as a Communist plot and later challenged Schulberg to a 
tequila-heavy midnight fist fight when they coincidentally found themselves in 
Puerto Vallarta. It ended in no decision, thanks to the intervention of 
Schulberg's late wife, Geraldine Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
(The Daily Worker first praised the book, then a week later denounced it as a 
"bourgeois canard," unfair to progressive forces in the industry.) 
</P>
<P>
Sammy went into the language and, in 1952, into Cerf's Modern Library, making 
Schulberg a shelf companion of Conrad and Dostoevski. In 1960, NBC did a 
two-part miniseries, with the late Larry Blyden as Sammy and John Forsythe as 
his kind mentor (and Schulberg's moral eye on the proceedings), Al Mannheim. 
Steve Lawrence sang Sammy for two years in a Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
Schulberg bought a farm in Bucks County, Pa. and there wrote his later novels, 
including "The Disenchanted," his fictionalized account of a disastrous weekend 
at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival as junior writer/guardian to F. Scott 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
Now, of all significant turns of event, Hollywood will evidently measure its 
own changes over the last half-century and film "What Makes Sammy Run?" the 
book it once regarded as a leprous act of treason by a native son. (Almost 
native: Schulberg lived here from age 4 until he went off to Dartmouth and then 
the service.) 
</P>
<P>
Schulberg has written a screenplay of "Sammy" and will likely co-produce with 
Gene Kirkwood ("Rocky," "The Pope of Greenwich Village"), starting, by present 
plan, this summer at Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
The author was in town recently to consult with his movie colleagues and to 
promote the 50th Anniversary Edition of "What Makes Sammy Run?" (Random House: 
$19.95, 320 pages) and a new collection of stories called "Love, Action, 
Laughter and Other Sad Tales" (Random House: $19.95, 352 pages). The 
anniversary edition includes his foreword from the Modern Library edition and a 
new afterword for this one, as well as the short stories in which Sammy first 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
In the afterword, Schulberg worries, as he did over breakfast one day last 
week, that Sammy is no longer exclusively a Hollywood type. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he never was. Schulberg initially heard from readers who had discovered 
Sammy in Hartford insurance companies, Southern chain stores and almost 
everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy was not exclusively Jewish either. The charge of anti-Semitism was laid 
on the book, although Schulberg pointed out that all of Sammy's victims were 
Jewish, too. A psychoanalyst found Sammy characteristic of many ambitious, 
second-generation Americans fighting to replace the loss of prestige their 
fathers had suffered in coming to the new country, and to replace the tribal 
values the sons no longer shared with the fathers. "Detribalization," Dr. Franz 
Alexander called the process and the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Schulberg fears that "What Makes Sammy Run?" has become what he 
calls "a handbook for yuppies." "It's a new handle on Sammy," Schulberg says. 
Sammy's credo of "success at all costs and it doesn't matter how you get there" 
makes the book seem not merely entertaining but a Bible of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
He first realized this, Schulberg says, the afternoon a senior came up to him 
one day after a talk at Hofstra University and said, "I felt a little nervous 
about going out into the world and making it. But reading 'Sammy' gives me 
confidence. I read it over and over." 
</P>
<P>
In his eloquent afterword, Schulberg laments that, "The book I had written as 
an angry expose of Sammy Glick was becoming a character reference." He 
concludes, "That's how they're reading it in 1989. And if that's the way they 
go on reading it, marching behind the flag of Sammy Glick, with the big dollar 
sign in the square where the stars used to be, the 20th-century version of 
Sammy is going to look like an Eagle Scout compared to the twenty-first." 
</P>
<P>
But Schulberg also argues that conscience and social responsibility are still 
alive in America, "if not too well." 
</P>
<P>
Next August will be the 25th anniversary of the Watts riots and Schulberg's 
founding of the Watts Writers Workshop. He remembers wandering down to Watts 
while the embers were still smoking, to see what he could do to help. At the 
Westminster Neighborhood Assn., someone suggested that if he was a writer he 
might teach writing to anyone who wanted to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a note on the bulletin board and went down every Wednesday afternoon to 
wait. For several weeks nothing happened except that people would put notes on 
the note about where I could shove my idea." Schulberg sat and read, and gave 
the idea until Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Then one man came by, was astonished when Schulberg demonstrated that you could 
write out of deep anger and still get it published, and signed on. The workshop 
met first in a pantry off the kitchen at the Settlement house, but quickly 
outgrew the space. Schulberg rented a house for $80 a month; then, when the 
writers outgrew it as well, found a burnt-out supermarket that the late James 
Thomas Jackson and other writers helped fix up. 
</P>
<P>
One of the alumni, Johnnie Scott, is a full professor at Cal State Northridge. 
The late Harry Dolan's play, "Losers Weepers," was presented on NBC. The 
Workshop here is kept alive by Jimmie Sherman and other alumni from a base at 
USC. Its Eastern offshoot, the Frederick Douglass Center for the Creative Arts 
in New York, has an enrollment of 250, Schulberg says, and a faculty that 
includes other Watts veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't need a $500,000 survey to find out what was wrong down there," 
Schulberg says. "Lousy education, high unemployment: They just couldn't get 
out. And I'm not sure anything has changed, except that there are more drugs 
and the unemployment is worse." 
</P>
<P>
Schulberg, now 75, lives well out on Long Island near a bird sanctuary at 
Quoque. After his wife Gerry died of cancer, he remarried and now has children 
10 and 7. His son is named Ben, after Schulberg's father, B.P., who once ran 
Paramount. The studio's present management last year named a building after the 
elder Schulberg and the son took a sentimental tour of the lot, where he had 
been a 17-year-old publicist before he went off to Dartmouth.

"Oscar and his shoeshine stand were gone," Schulberg says. But, if he poked 
into enough offices on the lot and around Hollywood, he could probably still 
locate Sammy Glick, and not a ghost either. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't re-read 'Sammy' for some time," Schulberg said at breakfast, "and 
when you do that, you usually see a lot of things you wish you could change, at 
least a little. But there's not very much I'd want to do to this one. It was as 
if I'd written it last week."

</DATELINE>

<P>
Four years ago, Mark Martin was at Daytona International Speedway, peering 
through a chain-link fence at Winston Cup drivers and the colorful stock cars 
they drive on NASCAR's high-banked speedways. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I could drive one, if I could just get the chance, but I really never 
thought the opportunity would come," Martin said Monday as his car owner, Jack 
Roush, tinkered with the Ford that Martin will drive Sunday in the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
Martin is not only entered in the 500, he is one of the favorites after winning 
six pole positions and a race at Rockingham, N.C., last year and finishing 
second six times. He finished third behind Rusty Wallace and Dale Earnhardt in 
the season-long Winston Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people may consider me one of the favorites, but to me, I'm still just 
the hillbilly kid from Arkansas who was outside that fence a few years ago," 
said Martin. "The only thing that changed is that I was lucky enough to have 
someone believe I belonged on the other side of the fence." 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 31, started his career at 15, driving a six-cylinder, '55 Chevy that 
his father had built. He raced it in the hobby class on quarter-mile dirt 
tracks near his home in Batesville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 18, he told his father, "There's no Daytona 500 on dirt," and began 
racing cars on asphalt in the American Speed Assn. In 1977 he was named rookie 
of the year and the next three years won the ASA championship. 
</P>
<P>
His success earned him a shot at Winston Cup racing in 1981, but the financial 
burden of losing his sponsor and trying to run his own under-financed team sent 
him packing back to the ASA. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Winston Cup racing at the end of the '82 season a broken man," Martin 
said. "I was broke -- emotionally, physically and financially." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, Martin said that his failure to make it in his first attempt 
turned out to be a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Those days were difficult, as difficult as I could imagine, but I'll never, 
ever forget that day, looking through the fence and saying to myself, 'I know I 
can do it, but I'll probably never get the chance.' " said Martin. "I had been 
sleeping in a truck, heading up and down the road, working 18-20 hours a day. 
And still not making it." 
</P>
<P>
Martin returned to his roots, driving in the ASA and winning the championship 
again in 1986. That caught the eye of Bruce Lawmaster, who hired him to drive 
his Ford in the 1987 Busch Grand National season. He won six poles and three 
races and attracted the attention of Roush, a highly successful builder of Ford 
Racing cars in Livonia, Mich., who was starting his own Winston Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
"Having been down as deep as I was, it makes everything that's happened to me 
that much more enjoyable," Martin said. "Four years ago, it was like I was in 
freezing cold, locked outside and nobody'd let me in. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time exactly three years ago that I broke out in hives from my 
forehead to my toes from nerves and working from dawn to dark, seven days a 
week, trying to get a Busch Grand National car ready to come down here. Now 
that's hard. I'm not saying it's really easy now, because racing is never easy. 
But I certainly haven't broken out in hives lately. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, all of a sudden, I'm with Roush, we win a race and finish up high most 
of the time, and the door opens and I climb on to NASCAR's private jet with 
(NASCAR president) Bill France Jr., and have a private conversation with him, 
and then I get picked up in a limo by (NASCAR vice president) Les Richter and 
get whisked away to receive the National Motorsports Press Assn. 
driver-of-the-year award. The transition is just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Martin has remained probably the most humble and unassuming 
driver on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in the July race at Daytona, Martin was leading when he ran out of 
fuel with only a few laps remaining. The miscalculation cost the team more than 
$200,000 in prize and bonus money. 
</P>
<P>
"You will never meet another person who yesterday is over for, more than it is 
with me," he said. "It's been that way from the beginning. When I was in ASA, 
every terrible day and every win was over by the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Last July can't be thought of -- or considered." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does Martin set goals for himself or his team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a defined goal-setter like people seem to wish I was," he said. "I 
assume most athletes in other fields set a lot of personal goals, because 
sportswriters seem to think I should have those kinds of goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I never have. My goal is the same was it always was -- to try to win every 
single race. If we set a goal, and we don't make it by year's end, people could 
make us feel that we didn't have as good a year as we felt we had. We don't 
want someone else to make us feel like we're not doing well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hard enough on myself. Riding our own tails is about all we can stand."
