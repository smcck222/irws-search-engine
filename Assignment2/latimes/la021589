S.D. SHERIFF OFF THE HOOK IN JAIL PROBE

The San Diego County Sheriff's Department was cleared Tuesday of any criminal 
wrongdoing in an FBI investigation of 70 cases of alleged civil rights 
violations stemming from beatings and deaths suffered by inmates in the county 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Atty. William Braniff said that his office and FBI investigators 
are still reviewing two cases to determine if criminal prosecution of deputies 
or other jail personnel is warranted. Braniff refused to identify the two 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy was out of town and not available for comment, but 
department officials said that they felt vindicated by the FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We're Very Pleased' 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're very pleased by the outcome of the FBI investigation. It's 
extremely reassuring . . . I can't stress that strongly enough," said Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Lt. Alan Fulmer. " . . . In my estimation, the fact that 
the FBI has completed its investigation and released these findings helps us 
considerably. . . . We've been the target of finger-pointing and unwarranted 
criticism for far too long, so, yes, we feel vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
But Braniff was careful to say that the findings do not necessarily mean that 
prosecutors felt that prosecution was unwarranted in every case. Some cases 
were borderline and could have gone either way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only make our judgment based on evidence. . . . If the evidence is not 
sufficient, we must make that judgment. I'm sure you could find cases that were 
closer to the border than others," Braniff said. Sometimes the decision whether 
to prosecute or not "came down to credibility issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declined Comment 
</P>
<P>
He declined to elaborate further or comment on individual cases that were 
investigated. The decision not to prosecute in the 70 cases was made by Braniff 
and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Braniff drew an immediate complaint from Roberto Martinez, 
co-chairman of the Coalition for Law and Justice, a community organization that 
looks into allegations of police brutality. He called the investigation's 
results shocking. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying that these people (jail personnel) are doing nothing wrong and 
all of these deaths and injuries were justified," said Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents began the investigation in May, after numerous complaints from 
alleged victims and critics who charged that deputies at the jails were beating 
inmates without cause. During the summer, a host of former inmates, many of 
them middle class with no criminal records, testified at a Board of Supervisors 
hearing about beatings they said they received while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the statute of limitations for criminal prosecutions, Braniff said 
that agents only investigated cases filed in the last five years. The incidents 
investigated were alleged to have occurred at the county jails in Vista, 
Santee, El Cajon, downtown and the women's jail at Las Colinas. 
</P>
<P>
Some inmate deaths have been attributed to beatings suffered at the hands of 
jailers. Braniff acknowledged that some of the cases investigated by the FBI 
included several deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff declined to say whether deputies were cleared in the death of Albert 
Manuel Varela. Varela, 28, died Jan. 21, 1988, after an altercation with four 
deputies while he was being booked for violating a restraining order. The 
deputies were exonerated by the district attorney's office; a coroner's report 
said Varela was a homicide victim but said the controversial choke hold applied 
by Deputy Roy Devault was not the direct cause of Varela's death. 
</P>
<P>
The findings of the investigation will be forwarded to the San Diego County 
Grand Jury, which is conducting a review of the county jail system. Grand Jury 
Foreman Armistead B. Smith Jr. declined to comment. However, Smith said that 
the Grand Jury's findings of its investigation of brutality at the jails will 
be released about March 15.

NEWSMAKERS: MAXIMUM PAYMENT OF $25,000 IS JUST A LIGHT REWARD

John Ledoux's National Guard buddies in Vermont call him "the $6-million man." 
Ledoux built an infrared light tester for $8.75 to replace a $4,500 device 
previously used by the military, for a savings of more than $6 million a year. 
But Ledoux's financial reward is much smaller. The part-time sergeant in the 
Vermont Army National Guard and full-time civilian employee of an Army National 
Guard base in Burlington, Vt., received a $10,000 incentive prize from the 
government more than a year ago. Now he also has received a check for $25,000 
from the federal Office of Personnel Management. "I feel like it's been put off 
for so long it's lost its glow," he said. The award is the maximum allowed by 
law and the largest given to a federal employee, officials said. Only 20 such 
awards have been granted. It took Ledoux, 33, only a couple of days in 1986 to 
build the hand-held device, used to test infrared lights on helicopters, out of 
a phototransistor, a light-emitting diode, a switch and a nine-volt battery 
that he bought at an electronics store.

 -- Actress Kathleen Turner was honored by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals at 
Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., as 1989 Woman of the Year. Turner was 
given the brass "Pudding Pot" award after a festive parade through Harvard 
Square. "I am happy," said Turner, who clutched a bouquet of red roses. "It's a 
cliche, but it's true." The undergraduate theatrical group has presented the 
award annually since 1951. Past recipients include Meryl Streep, Lucille Ball 
and Joan Rivers.

 -- Buckingham Palace has joined the drive to reduce the amount of lead in the 
air. Many of Queen Elizabeth's cars, including five Rolls-Royces, will be 
converted to run on lead-free gasoline, the palace announced. The decision 
followed the queen's appearance at a charity event in London in which 100 
children released 10,000 balloons carrying the words, "I Love Lead-Free," 
reflecting public concern over the effects on health of lead in gas fumes. Of 
22 million cars on British roads, only about 2 million have been converted to 
lead-free fuel. The queen, who took a course in basic auto mechanics during 
World War II, chatted with two mechanics working on her claret-colored 1977 
Jubilee Rolls. She asked how the conversion would affect the car's performance 
and looked to see "what was what," mechanic David Wright said. SHIRLEY MARLOW

JUDGE SAYS PROBLEMS IN COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE LED TO ORDER TO HALT CIVIL TRIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A management breakdown in the San Diego County clerk's office is mostly to 
blame for the postponement of all new civil trials in San Diego while a 
critical backlog of criminal cases is resolved, Presiding Superior Court Judge 
Michael I. Greer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows what the problem is," Greer told a group of reporters in his 
chambers. And that problem, he said, lies in the county clerk's office. 
"(There's a) morale problem over there (that's) next to horrible." He went on 
to say that he has questions over the way personnel in the office are assigned. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's statements brought a strong rebuttal from veteran County Clerk 
Robert D. Zumwalt, who said that Greer "wasn't being candid with the 
newspapers" and that it's the judges and their staffs who control the vital 
factor of scheduling trials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clerk's Office Defended 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked here for 33 years and I know exactly what he's (implying)," 
Zumwalt said. "I think he's just trying to throw up some type of smog or 
something to shift the blame to the county clerk." 
</P>
<P>
According to the judge, the courts rely on the clerk's office for critical 
information about pending cases, yet the clerk's office is separate from the 
judges, who have no management control over the office. A lawsuit over the 
management issue is now pending before the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) can't manage a system where we don't manage the people . . . (where) 
someone else does," Greer said. "I'm not into complaining . . . (but) that's my 
major problem." 
</P>
<P>
While the judge explained that other important ingredients were also behind 
last Friday's decision to delay new civil trials -- such as 18 vacant 
judgeships that Gov. George Deukmejian has yet to fill -- he claimed it was the 
lack of adequate information from the clerk's office that ultimately led to the 
postponements. 
</P>
<P>
When a new computer-based system to track criminal cases became operational 
about two weeks ago -- a system Greer said relies on information provided by 
the clerk's office -- the judge said it was the first time he had "some sort of 
management device" over that aspect of the court system. To his chagrin, the 
new system led him to "find snakes all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it wasn't until last Friday morning, he said, that he found out how 
bad things really were. "I had no idea when I walked in Friday what was going 
to happen," the judge said. He learned quickly, though, over breakfast with 
Superior Court Judge Herbert J. Exarhos, who supervises the criminal courts. 
</P>
<P>
There were several criminal cases facing certain dismissal that day unless 
their trials started immediately, Greer was told. Under law, criminal cases 
must be in court within 60 days, unless the defendant waives that right. 
</P>
<P>
While an abundance of criminal cases has led to brief delays in San Diego civil 
trials in the past, this situation was much more serious, causing Greer to 
impose a courtwide halt on new civil trials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I'm Not Happy' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy about not having a warning," he said. "I just think we got 
overwhelmed. . . . My concern is why wasn't I told I was going to be 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
But Zumwalt rebutted many of Greer's claims. He said the judges' staff handles 
both the new computer system and the scheduling of criminal trials. "We have no 
control over that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county clerk's staff reports daily to Exarhos about the status of 
criminal cases, informing him of how many days are left before a case must go 
to trial or be dismissed. If Greer or other judges weren't aware of the 
oncoming problem, then it's because of a communications breakdown between the 
judges and their staffs, Zumwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
The current crisis, Zumwalt said, can be attributed to the large number of 
judicial vacancies and the increasing number of criminal cases, which are 
taking longer to prosecute. "I don't think there's anyone to blame for what's 
happening," Zumwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Greer said it isn't the first time the county has been faced with 
having too many criminal cases and too few judges. In the past, he said, the 
problem has lasted from a few days to two weeks, but, until now, has never been 
widely known by the public. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Proceedings 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday was the first full day of the ban, and, according to Greer, most things 
went smoothly, with about eight criminal cases set for trial, fewer than the 17 
or more anticipated last Friday. The criminal trials -- ranging from armed 
robbery and a felon in possession of a gun to manslaughter to murder -- were 
sent to civil and family courts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Judge James R. Milliken, who was in the midst of a two-week civil 
trial, was assigned a double armed robbery trial. Milliken will either have to 
stop the civil trial for a few days or decide to split his day in half, setting 
aside time for both the criminal and civil proceedings, Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Donald L. Meloche, who usually hears civil cases, was assigned a murder 
case that is estimated to last six weeks. Judge Vincent P. Di Figlia had just 
empaneled a jury for what is expected to be a lengthy civil case, but he was 
forced to send the jury home so that he could begin a criminal sanity hearing 
instead. Family Court Judge William J. Howatt Jr. was forced to take over a 
criminal case on Tuesday afternoon. Some criminal cases were continued. 
</P>
<P>
Three of four judges who were scheduled to attend a conference in Monterey 
canceled their trips to help with the criminal backlog. Greer said other judges 
have offered to cancel their vacations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
18 Vacancies on Bench 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court currently has 53 judges. It is authorized to have 71. Greer 
said that, if the court had its full complement of judges, "I'd be trying every 
criminal case" and every civil case, as well. 
</P>
<P>
The court was particularly hurt with the recent retirement of three judges and 
the elevation to the appellate court of two others, Greer said. He said he 
hopes to have replacements for those five in a month or so. He said his 
optimism is based on discussions others have had with Deukmejian. Greer says he 
doesn't want to complain about the San Diego County situation directly to the 
governor's office, saying he doesn't think "complaining gets you anything" 
considering other demands on Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
It may take a month or 60 days before the courts return to normal, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Greer met with a large group of civil attorneys at noon to "discuss how Humpty 
Dumpty is put together again." He and others are worried that the sudden 
onslaught of criminal cases will, in turn, lead to a crippling backlog of civil 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1986 Trial Court Delay Reduction Act, San Diego is one of nine 
California counties selected for a "fast track" pilot program aimed at speeding 
along civil cases. As a result, 98% of all civil cases have been settled within 
a year of filing in the county, with the rest going to trial within 13 months. 
It is the certainty of having an open court in which to hold a trial that has 
led to the many settlements, Greer and other legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But now there is no such certainty, and the judge is worried it could play 
havoc with the pilot program if things aren't resolved soon. For example, four 
civil trials were postponed Tuesday and one other, concerning the battle over 
the takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Corp. by SCEcorp., was referred to 
a court referee, a retired judge hired by the two parties to hear the the 
non-jury case.

REFEREE URGES THE DISBARRING OF DEFENSE ATTORNEY DEMASSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A California State Bar referee has recommended that well-known San Diego 
criminal defense attorney Phillip DeMassa be disbarred because in 1979 he 
harbored a fugitive connected with the infamous "Coronado Company" marijuana 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation, made by referee Gary Carlin on Feb. 3 and released publicly 
Tuesday, now goes to a review committee of the State Bar. If the committee 
concurs, it will be forwarded to the state Supreme Court, which traditionally 
upholds such recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moral Turpitude Denied 
</P>
<P>
DeMassa, 43, said he will ask for a new hearing because of his contention that 
he was not guilty of moral turpitude, the basis on which Carlin made his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
DeMassa pleaded guilty in November, 1985, to harboring Robert Kent Lahodney for 
a night in 1979, a week before Lahodney turned himself in to federal 
authorities. Lahodney subsequently pleaded guilty to marijuana smuggling, 
conspiracy to obstruct the government in collection of taxes, two counts of tax 
evasion, and engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. 
</P>
<P>
DeMassa himself was a central figure in the government's investigation into the 
marijuana-smuggling ring, founded by young men who used surfboards to bring 
marijuana into the United States from Mexico and which grew in sophistication 
and scope. 
</P>
<P>
DeMassa initially was charged by federal prosecutors with involvement in a drug 
conspiracy with members of the so-called Coronado Company, 60 of whom were 
ultimately convicted for various roles. 
</P>
<P>
During that investigation, federal agents searched DeMassa's office and home 
and retrieved more than 1,000 of his files. Later, however, an appeals court 
ruled the search illegal because it violated DeMassa's clients' rights to 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego dropped its drug-related charges 
against DeMassa in exchange for his guilty pleas to three counts of illegal 
currency transactions and the one count of harboring a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5-Year Probation 
</P>
<P>
DeMassa was placed on five years' probation and sentenced to six months in a 
community treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the plea bargain, DeMassa was barred from practicing in federal 
court, but it was reported at the time the crimes to which he confessed did not 
involve moral turpitude. Because of his guilty plea to a felony, the state 
Supreme Court ordered the State Bar to decide whether he should be allowed to 
practice in state court. 
</P>
<P>
In his 21-page decision, Carlin, a neutral arbiter, concluded that DeMassa be 
disbarred because "the presumptively appropriate level of discipline for the 
final conviction of a crime which involves moral turpitude, either inherently 
or in the facts and circumstances surrounding the crime's commission, is 
disbarment." 
</P>
<P>
Carlin said he could not argue for less severe punishment -- such as a two-year 
suspension -- despite DeMassa's "lack of a prior record, his good faith, 
brilliance, dedication, personality and character, and his remorse, contrition 
and rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, DeMassa maintained that he was not guilty of moral turpitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Intellectually, it's a wrong decision," he said in an interview. "It didn't 
take into consideration the realities of ethics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ethically Proper' 
</P>
<P>
He said harboring a fugitive "was an ethically proper act, since it aided the 
justice system. It (harboring a fugitive) is technically a violation of 
statute, but does that constitute moral turpitude? At some point, someone is 
going to have to address the ethical obligations of a lawyer when a fugitive 
comes to you. 
</P>
<P>
"If you drive him down the street in your car and you turn right to the airport 
for the purposes of his fleeing, or if you turn left and take him home for the 
purposes of turning him in -- either way, you are aiding him," DeMassa argued. 
</P>
<P>
During his defense before the confidential State Bar hearing, DeMassa said 
several witnesses -- including lawyers and judges -- testified that he acted 
appropriately by allowing Lahodney to stay at his house overnight because the 
outcome of his decision ultimately aided prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Among those testifying on DeMassa's behalf, according to Carlin's decision 
paper, were Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. of the 4th District Court of Appeals, 
and federal Magistrate Edward Infante.

RULING BARS BUYOUT STUDY OF SDG&amp;E BY WATER AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court referee Tuesday temporarily blocked the County Water 
Authority's plans to study a municipal takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., granting the utility's request for a restraining order until a fuller 
hearing can be held March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling that the month's delay will do no harm to the Water Authority's bid to 
conduct a feasibility study, Superior Court Referee Harold F. Wolters wrote 
that the outcome of the court case hinges on the Water Authority's efforts to 
win passage of state legislation allowing a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego) is sponsoring legislation that would 
change the 45-year-old law that created the Water Authority to give it the 
power to acquire the utility. 
</P>
<P>
"Until legislative action authorizes (the Water Authority) to own and operate 
the SDG&amp;E system, it cannot legally do so," Wolters wrote in his decision. 
" . . . Should that proposed legislation fail, there is good reason to believe 
that (SDG&amp;E) could prevail ultimately in this action, as the facts are 
presented to the referee at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Water Authority officials expressed surprise at the decision, but promised to 
continue with lobbying and other activities related to the legislative effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a setback," said Jim Melton, director of public information for the 
Water Authority. "We are very surprised and very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money for Study Frozen 
</P>
<P>
Melton agreed that Wolters' decision freezes expenditure of the $100,000 
budgeted for R.W. Beck &amp; Associates, a Seattle-based consultant that is 
under contract to conduct the feasibility study. Melton said that Water 
Authority lawyers would study the decision to determine whether any more of the 
$940,000 budgeted for takeover activities is frozen by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Utility officials, who hailed Wolters' ruling, claimed that the restraining 
order prevents the Water Authority from spending any money except the funds 
devoted to its legislative effort. Steven Wall, SDG&amp;E's attorney, declined 
to specify the amount of money he believes is frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Downey, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who has led a 
high-profile campaign against the merger, also expressed disappointment with 
Wolters' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E officials "keep contending that once the facts are out, people will 
see that this is the most wonderful thing ever," Downey said. "The question is, 
what are they afraid of? Let's have a study." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E filed suit in Superior Court last week to prevent the Water Authority 
from spending taxpayers' funds to conduct a study of the takeover. The agency 
wants to explore the takeover as an alternative to SDG&amp;E's planned 
$2.4-billion merger with Rosemead-based SCEcorp, parent company of Southern 
California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Under threat of the SDG&amp;E lawsuit, the Water Authority's board of directors 
voted Thursday to increase the budget for the first phase of its takeover 
effort from $250,000 to $940,000. The budget includes money for the study, 
lobbying, legal defense and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Cause Taxpayers Harm 
</P>
<P>
As a county taxpayer, SDG&amp;E argued in a hearing Tuesday morning that 
allowing the Water Authority to spend public money would cause taxpayers 
irreparable harm. Water Authority attorney Paul Engstrand did not dispute that 
the utility has the standing to make that argument, though he disagreed with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the reasons we jumped in now, because as this thing develops 
through the feasibility analysis, it is totally possible that they could spend 
millions of dollars," said Karen Hutchens, SDG&amp;E's governmental affairs 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Wall also contended that the Water Authority had no right to conduct the study 
before the passage of legislation allowing a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to stave off the temporary restraining order, Engstrand countered that 
SDG&amp;E would suffer no irreparable harm if the study proceeded until a 
fuller hearing on the matter sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Wolters, saying that a balancing of the competing claims led him to decide in 
favor of SDG&amp;E, worried that "the expenditure of funds of a considerable 
sum when from public assets should be of particular concern if, in fact, there 
is some doubt as to whether such funds could be recovered." 
</P>
<P>
Wolters, a retired Superior Court judge, scheduled a March 14 hearing on 
SDG&amp;E's request for a preliminary injunction, which, if approved, would 
extend the ban on the feasibility study until the lawsuit could be litigated.

Unlike its prestigious counterpart in Boston, the Los Angeles Marathon is known 
more for its unusual entries than for record-threatening times. 
</P>
<P>
The cast of eccentrics in last year's spectacle here included a juggler, three 
basketball dribblers, a "centipede" of 13 individuals joined at the head by a 
piece of ribbon, a French waiter carrying a champagne bottle on a tray, and two 
men in doctors' smocks transporting a ragman on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
The March 5 race promises to be just as flaky this year, offering such 
characters as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas Rohrer, 52, a Casanova of the Causeways who hands out red roses from 
a hat as he runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joey Hamp, who gives new meaning to the term marathon dancer by halting her 
run every four miles to dance for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Todd Peterson, a U.S. Coast Guard technician, who plans to re-enlist near 
the starting line and then run the race, assuming he can get shore leave. 
</P>
<P>
The Firemen's Grapevine magazine notes that the 1904 budget of the Los Angeles 
Fire Department amounted to $192,805.84 and included such line entries as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Horses ($4,425). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Horseshoeing ($1,515.50). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hay ($10,748.45). 
</P>
<P>
This year's budget is more than a thousand times higher at $202 million. 
</P>
<P>
What's really startling about the current figure, spokesman Vince Marzo pointed 
out, is that "we don't buy hay any more." 
</P>
<P>
Please don't feed the praying mantis: 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Natural History Museum says it will open an insect zoo 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
No word yet on whether the insect park will follow the lead of the Los Angelez 
Zoo and allow patrons to donate money to "adopt" one of the critters. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a standoff between the Bush Administration and the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors 
</P>
<P>
First, President Bush passed over Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who wanted the 
post of secretary of transportation. That hurt. But now, Dan Wolf, the 
spokesman for Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, has turned down an offer of a job as 
chief speech writer for Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Instead, Wolf is 
moving over to the Disney Co. in Burbank as manager of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose Mickey Mouse over the State Department," Wolf noted. 
</P>
<P>
It's an offer that sounds too good to be true. And it isn't true, warns the Los 
Angeles Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
A slender, 30-ish man who's about 5 feet, 2 inches tall has reportedly posed as 
a city maintenance worker and duped at least five residents in the county into 
paying from $40 to $100 for paving work he doesn't perform. 
</P>
<P>
The impostor, who wears a white hard hat and a yellow safety vest, usually 
claims the job will be done for free, but later asks for money to buy 
additional materials to complete the project, said Public Works spokesman Tony 
Harris. 
</P>
<P>
His latest victim was initially skeptical, Harris said, until the impostor 
"pointed down the street and said, 'There's my crew.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's what they get for asking: 
</P>
<P>
The executive officer of the Los Angeles County Superior Court requested 
authorization from the Board of Supervisors to have liquor served in the Santa 
Monica Courthouse for a pre-retirement birthday party for Superior Court Judge 
Leonard S. Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it "bad public policy," the supervisors said no. 
</P>
<P>
Look for a change of venue. 
</P>
<P>
It's the fear of every caller skeptical about the thoroughness of an 
information operator. John Stein of West Los Angeles asked for an individual's 
number and was told there was no listing. Undeterred, he dialed operator 
assistance again and asked for the same number. The operator checked and said, 
"Still no listing."

GREETING CARD LINE PULLED FROM RACKS AFTER PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAUREEN FAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Mesa card shop took several greeting cards off its shelves Tuesday after 
more than 25 San Diego State University students picketed the store to protest 
the cards, which they described as racially and sexually offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Dick and Suzie Collier, who own Suzie's Hallmark on Lake Murray Boulevard, said 
they did not believe the cards, which show a large black woman in a variety of 
outfits and roles that students described as "demeaning to women and blacks," 
were offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"We wouldn't have bought them if we thought they were," Dick Collier said. 
"They seemed funny." Collier said the cards were probably not in good taste, 
but he did not believe they were racist. 
</P>
<P>
One shows a large black woman and a slim white woman posing as prostitutes. "I 
would have gotten you a surprise for your birthday," the card reads, "but, I 
was afraid I'd get the size and color wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Billi Gordon, the black model, and the Colliers called the protest "censorship 
by intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
"No one is sacred when it comes to comedy," Gordon said in a telephone 
interview Tuesday. "That's the beauty of America. . . . You have the right to 
express yourself. I find Eddie Murphy's attitudes toward women and homosexuals 
very offensive, but I would never go so far as to say he shouldn't be allowed 
to perform." 
</P>
<P>
Suzie Collier said the cards were removed, not to satisfy the students' demands 
but because their protest was distracting to customers and to neighboring 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
The students, who demonstrated Monday and Tuesday, plan to protest at other San 
Diego stores that carry the cards, including Graffiti in Horton Plaza, unless 
it also agrees to pull the cards. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided Monday and Tuesday would be the best days to protest (at Suzie's 
Hallmark) because it was the day before Valentine's Day and it would hit the 
store the hardest. We wanted to tell them we wouldn't put up with this," said 
SDSU student Kim Harris, one of several students who helped organize the event. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa Meyd, floor manager at Graffiti, said the store had not received any 
complaints about the cards. Meyd could not comment on whether or not the cards 
would be removed, and a store manager could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is to get them off the shelf and to raise awareness of the existence 
of greeting cards which are demeaning to women and blacks," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Students got involved Friday after Theodore Kornweibel, an Afro-American 
studies professor at SDSU, brought to class a few cards purchased from Suzie's 
Hallmark, Harris said. One showed model Billi Gordon imitating Prissy, the 
squeaky-voiced, tearful young slave in the movie "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
The students then organized their protest and are now compiling a list of other 
retailers who sell the cards. Signatures are being gathered to petition the 
publisher, West Graphics Inc. of San Francisco, to discontinue Gordon's line. 
Harris said SDSU students were also contacting friends at other California 
State University and University of California campuses to see if the offensive 
cards were being sold elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Randy West, president of West Graphics, said the company had no plans to 
discontinue Gordon's cards, which he said have sold very well. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of stores which sell only black merchandise and are geared 
for blacks. They stock our cards and do not have a problem with them," he said. 
"We're not attacking anybody and we're not trying to create a victim." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon voiced personal objection to the student's demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"They're protesting my . . . spoof on the 'Gone With the Wind' character. I 
find that offensive because my grandmother was a scrub woman like that," she 
said. "I don't feel ashamed at having come from slaves. . . . I think it's a 
proud part of my heritage because it's something we overcame." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU sophomore La Shon Walker said Gordon was "making a mockery of her own 
heritage and that's . . . sad." 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Bernay Griffin, another SDSU sophomore, said the Prissy character was 
an example of the fact that greeting cards often fail to depict blacks in a 
positive light. 
</P>
<P>
Kornweibel said of Gordon: "If she can feel that unaffected by the stereotype, 
that's OK for her. But there are millions of black women who labor under that 
cruel stereotype." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Comford, of El Capitan High School in Lakeside, said black history should 
not be presented in a "supposedly humorous" way. Comford, 17, attended the 
protest after hearing about it from a friend at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
The students were well-dressed and followed picketing guidelines because "we 
didn't want to be known as rowdy college students out for no reason," Harris 
said. "We wanted to let people know we were serious." 
</P>
<P>
Three or four bystanders joined the picket line Monday, Harris said. A 
middle-aged man and his two children who joined the protest Tuesday declined to 
comment or give his name.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido woman was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run driving and 
driving under the influence of alcohol Monday night after she allegedly struck 
and killed a 52-year-old pedestrian on Centre City Parkway and then drove home, 
Escondido police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Wilhelmina M. Broadway, 44, was northbound about 7 p.m. when she 
allegedly struck Don Jespersen of Vista. Jespersen had driven off the road at 
Centre City Parkway and California 78 and was walking to or from a nearby 
business when he was hit. He was taken to Palomar Medical Center, where he died 
in surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A witness to the accident followed the car that hit Jespersen, then returned to 
the scene of the accident to report the car to police. Police arrested Broadway 
at her home a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway was being held Tuesday in County Jail in lieu of $6,250 bail.

EX-REPORTER MACDOUGALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Shaw's story on the former Los Angeles Times and Wall Street Journal 
reporter, A. Kent MacDougall, attempted to discredit MacDougall's recently 
published boast that he had insinuated material promoting his radical beliefs 
into the stories he wrote for those papers ("A 'Closet Socialist' Stirs Furor 
Over News Stories," Part I, Jan. 31). Shaw perceived that MacDougall's 
confession that he had been a media mole provided strong support to those who 
charge that journalists let their views influence what they report and how they 
report it. Shaw did his best to prove this wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, Shaw demonstrated the truth of the charge almost as well as 
MacDougall had done in his Monthly Review articles. Shaw's story revealed his 
liberal bias just as clearly as MacDougall's stories in The Times and the 
Journal had revealed his. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw didn't even consider the possibility that MacDougall got away with his 
deception at The Times and the Journal because of, not in spite of, the fact 
that some of his editors shared his ideological views.

MOTHER TERESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a world where heroes and heroines are few, the article "Mother Teresa Brings 
a Message of Hope to Homeless Latino Youths in Los Angeles" (Metro, Feb. 1) 
gave your readers a chance to hope again. Mother Teresa's visit to those 
homeless youngsters definitely showed a "message of love." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager I know that it is important for adolescents to have role models. 
Mother Teresa gives everyone a special message. Love is vital to human life. 
This woman has shown us how to reach out to others with care and concern. 
</P>
<P>
She challenges us to do the same -- to give without expecting something in 
return. Is this not a possible solution for those who fill their lives with 
drugs, harmful relationships, and overemphasis upon material possessions? We 
must give of our love to those in need.

<P>
No one can accuse NBC of lacking a delicious sense of irony. During a recent 
"Today Show," one of that network's newscasters, in a story on Vice President 
Quayle's visit to Central America, described the war in El Salvador as (I 
paraphrase) "a war which still continues despite more than $3 billion in 
military aid from the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
I was disappointed that the next story wasn't about "a fire which still 
continues to rage despite thousands of gallons of gasoline from firefighters."

WILL ON 'RACIAL SPOILS SYSTEM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The truth about "affirmative action" is that we've always had it. It's not a 
new-fangled liberal idea to help minorities, as many claim. 
</P>
<P>
The "old boy network" -- nepotism, cronyism, member-of-the-club and alumni-ism 
to help favored sons -- was the most successful affirmative action program ever 
devised. The only difference is the recipients of this affirmative action were 
wealthy white males . . . and still are! Do you think J. Danforth Quayle got 
ahead on "merit"? 
</P>
<P>
The question is not whether we will love "affirmative action," but who it will 
benefit. Why not give minorities and women a chance?

WILL ON 'RACIAL SPOILS SYSTEM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is in response to George Will's column "The Court Reagan Built Does 
Much to Roll Back the Racial Spoils System" (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 29). 
</P>
<P>
It is surprising to note how much history a historian can forget. Will's essay 
ignores the central issue which led to reverse racial discrimination: A white 
male quota system, a white male spoils system, a white male discrimination 
system exists and has oppressed, tormented and killed American citizens for 
hundreds of years. This system is not legal, but cultural. 
</P>
<P>
Few laws remain on the books to identify it, but it exists and is highly 
visible. One simple example is the practice of many elite universities which 
give admission preferences to the children of alumni as a separate 
consideration in addition to academic qualifications. Such a system promotes 
the racial imbalance of the past. A separate guideline to insure a similar 
special consideration for ethnic and female applicants must be put in place 
while the first guideline continues. 
</P>
<P>
Too many statistics about pay, hiring and promotion practices; too many 
incidents of neighborhood racism; too much emphasis on the legalities of racial 
and gender quotas belie a subtle and not-so-subtle evil. Will writes that 
blacks have gained much, not from changes in government but from changes in our 
"free society." Free society? It is dangerously naive to presume and print that 
we are all free. 
</P>
<P>
What is Will's solution to the current racism and sexism in our society? 
Criticizing one approach is a worthless and mean-spirited endeavor without a 
greater effort towards designing and enacting a comprehensive solution. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Will, lead, follow or get out of the way.

ANGST IN AFGHANISTAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the departure of the last Soviet combat troops from Afghanistan, the 
nine-year-long war seems poised to enter a new and perhaps more violent phase. 
President Najibullah's Marxistregime and defection-ridden army are coming under 
intensified siege from the estimated 200,000 armed guerrillas scattered around 
the Texas-size country -- 30,000 of whom already surround Kabul, the capital. 
Virtually everyone believes that the regime must fall. Whether it lasts days, 
weeks or months could depend on how well the resistance groups coordinate their 
military activities. But even if tactical cooperation is achieved -- and the 
war has seen precious little of that -- it is unlikely that an effective 
coalition government will soon emerge to supplant what the Red Army left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, the world is about to reminded, remains a country riven by tribal 
loyalties and ethnic jealousies. Seven major guerrilla groups have emerged from 
the 3 million Afghan refugees in next-door Pakistan; other forces have come 
from among the 2 million refugees who fled to neighboring Iran. A council of 
resistance organizations summoned to form an interim government hasn't been 
able to agree on how power should be apportioned. Muslim fundamentalists dream 
of an Afghanistan reborn as an Iran-style Islamic republic, repressive and 
reactionary. Many oppose the fundamentalists. They know what they are against; 
the problem is that they don't always agree on what they are for. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush says that American military aid to the resistance groups -- $2 
billion worth has so far been delivered -- will go on until the Soviet Union 
stops supplying Najibullah. A quick rethinking of that policy will be called 
for, however, if tribal and ideological turbulence produces not a consensus for 
post-Marxist unity but a renewal of civil strife. Some in Washington are 
already talking in terms of an Afghanistan faced with chronic conflict, like 
Ethiopia or Sudan. Some, fearing the worst, even warn about the possible 
Lebanonization of the country. Already different factions are getting money, 
arms and advice from Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and perhaps other Islamic 
countries. It would be naive to think these are selfless gifts. 
</P>
<P>
This war has taken a terrible toll. Nearly one-third of Afghanistan's 16 
million people have been forced to flee the country, hundreds of thousands have 
died, tens of thousands have been maimed. But even if peace were somehow 
miraculously to take hold, Afghans will probably continue to die of war wounds 
for years to come, victims of the millions of anti-personnel mines 
indiscriminately left strewn over the landscape by the Soviets. To this grim 
prospect must be added the chances of high-toll internecine warfare as the 
competition for power and influence deepens. 
</P>
<P>
The Afghan resistance movement, with help from its friends, has reached a point 
where its triumph seems assured. The foreign invader has been driven out, a 
regime with only the barest popular support seems on the edge of being 
overthrown. Now comes a new challenge, the unsettled and deeply contentious 
question of how the political nature of Afghanistan's future will be decided.

Thank you for your evocative editorial ("A Park in the Balance," Jan. 25) 
saluting the federal-state partnership in the Santa Monica Mountains. We are 
very proud of the role we played in transferring Circle X Ranch and Campground 
to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreational Area. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years over 65,000 acres have been acquired in public trust in 
the scenic Santa Monica Mountains. In addition, the conservancy has fostered 
volunteerism in the Santa Monica Mountains. In 1988 the estimated value of 
volunteer effort exceeds $1 million. With over 40 million visitors to the parks 
and beaches of the Santa Monica Mountains, your editorial set forth the 
outstanding recreational opportunity and public resources the mountains offer 
the Southland.

EX-REPORTER MACDOUGALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am concerned about the "rush to excuse" attitudes demonstrated in your 
article about MacDougall. Everyone from the dean of a graduate school of 
journalism to various editors of The Times and the Wall Street Journal seemed 
eager to make light of MacDougall's leftist magazine article, "Boring From 
Within the Bourgeois Press." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, this is a man who admits to being staunchly Marxist and claims to have 
for many years used his position as a Times and Journal reporter to secretly 
"help popularize radical ideas." MacDougall describes the use of techniques 
like making sure to seek out experts whose opinions he knew in advance would 
support his subversive thesis. These revelations are too hastily dismissed as 
"exaggerated" by the editors who worked with him. I question their willingness 
to face the truth just as I would question a nuclear plant manager's dismissive 
account of a "small accident." Serious implications require a serious response.

TAPIA'S DOWNSTREAM DISSENTERS LOSE; 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLING OF SEWAGE PLANT'S CAPACITY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan to double the capacity of a Calabasas sewage plant to handle a coming 
population explosion between Woodland Hills and Thousand Oaks has been approved 
-- despite the objections of Malibu residents living downstream. 
</P>
<P>
The capacity of the Tapia Sewage Treatment Plant will be boosted from its 
existing level of 8 million gallons per day to 16 million gallons under a plan 
endorsed unanimously Monday night by directors of the Las Virgenes Municipal 
Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they hope to finish the $50-million expansion by 1992 -- when as 
many as 15,000 new homes will either be completed or under construction in 
Westlake Village, Agoura Hills, Agoura and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage plant now serves about 20,000 homes and businesses in the 
120-square-mile area. Fees on developers of $2,800 per new home will pay for 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
The newly approved plan is the fourth expansion of the 23-year-old plant at the 
northern end of Malibu Canyon, and officials said it is expected to be the 
final one. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of an exclusive area at the canyon's mouth -- as they have each time 
the Tapia plant has expanded -- have protested the newest enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
Malibu residents charged two weeks ago that treated effluent released by the 
plant into Malibu Creek possibly contains dangerous levels of germs. 
</P>
<P>
They said two research scientists at a Malibu Township Council seminar last 
month said present methods of testing waste water for cleanliness do not reveal 
some pathogenic organisms. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, residents charged, some bacteria and viruses that could be 
dangerous to humans may be escaping undetected from the plant to contaminate 
Malibu Lagoon and the nearby Malibu Colony movie star enclave. 
</P>
<P>
Those suggestions were dismissed Monday by a Las Virgenes consultant. In a 
report to officials, consultant Will Stokes said one of the scientists later 
maintained that her comments were taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes, a former general manager of the Las Virgenes district, said testing 
methods are more than adequate to detect bacterial pathogens at safety levels 
established by state health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's 5-0 approval by Las Virgenes officials of the plant's expansion 
followed a similar Feb. 6 endorsement by the Ventura County-based Triunfo 
County Sanitation District. That agency provides sewer service to the 
southeastern edge of Ventura County and owns a third of the 70-acre Tapia 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Las Virgenes district spokeswoman Diane Eaton said Tuesday that the Tapia 
plant, which handles 7 million gallons of raw sewage a day, is approaching its 
capacity of 8 million gallons. An $11-million expansion project to increase the 
plant's daily capacity to 10 million gallons will be completed in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Expansion 
</P>
<P>
The final expansion to 16 million gallons will involve about 18 months of 
construction, Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
The new work will be confined to 15 acres already in use at the Tapia plant. 
Space for the new equipment will be made available by moving some 
sludge-handling equipment to a separate site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's action clears the way for the district to solicit design bids for the 
expansion, officials said. Before actual construction can begin, approval must 
be granted by the state's Regional Water Quality Control Board, the state 
Coastal Commission and the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Those approvals are expected to be routinely granted because of the Tapia 
plant's recent record of successful operation. 
</P>
<P>
The plant had been troubled in the past by breakdowns and accidental discharges 
of raw sewage -- including one failure eight years ago that sent 5.5 million 
gallons of sewage a day into Malibu Creek and forced county health officials to 
close 65 miles of beaches to swimmers for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But last year, the Tapia plant was named the best facility of its type in the 
United States by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Earlier in 1988, 
it was proclaimed the best in Southern California by regional EPA officials.

COUNTY MAY LIFT ITS BAN, LEASE OLIVE VIEW LAND TO RAISE MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's self-imposed moratorium on developing vacant land at Olive 
View Medical Center in Sylmar could be ending soon, according to a report 
released Tuesday to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have estimated that leasing a small portion of the hospital's 
property to a private developer could generate $20 million in revenue for the 
cash-strapped county during the next 20 years. A 34-acre site west of the 
medical center would be leased for light industrial or commercial and retail 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"From an economic standpoint, we feel the favorable market conditions in the 
Sylmar area support proceeding with the project," wrote Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard B. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
More than four years have elapsed since the county last proposed making money 
off empty land at the medical center. But the plan to lease space to a 
water-slide amusement park outraged community activists. They persuaded 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, to kill the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promise From County 
</P>
<P>
Residents also extracted a promise from the county that no development plans 
would be unveiled until Olive View had been operating for two years. It was 
agreed that this would allow time to see how the new medical center, which 
opened in the spring of 1987, would affect surrounding neighborhoods. At the 
time, residents said they were especially concerned about the increased traffic 
the hospital would generate. 
</P>
<P>
The county is conducting traffic studies, updating its appraisals of the 
hospital property and preparing drawings of a typical business park. If the 
results are positive, county officials hope to hold public hearings on the 
proposal to lease land. In May, the county could circulate its proposal among 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is approved by the board, the county anticipates selecting a 
developer by March, 1990, and signing a lease four months later. 
</P>
<P>
Hannah Dyke, a founder of Olive View Neighborhood Watch, said it would be 
premature to predict the community's reaction to revised development plans. 
</P>
<P>
But she added: "We'll be extremely concerned about the traffic. We will be 
concerned about the provision for people who ride horses in the area and what 
type of development they will put in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angry About Plans 
</P>
<P>
Chuck O'Connell, an officer of the group, said he was angry that the county had 
made preliminary plans without consulting the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really surprised and disappointed," he said. "We'll have to get cracking 
again to have them not step on the community again." 
</P>
<P>
The Olive View update was requested last week by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who 
expressed frustration that the land had remained vacant for so long. He 
complained that the county was losing a money-making opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
After reading the report, Schabarum remained unsatisfied. He complained Tuesday 
that the county had not considered selling a large chunk of land to a home 
builder and had considered leasing only 34 acres. County officials estimated 
that there are as many as 600 empty acres on the Olive View grounds, with some 
reserved for potential hospital expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"That property is just in limbo," Schabarum said. "Nobody wants to deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon promised Schabarum that his office would explore selling some of the 
property or leasing more land. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich sat quietly at the meeting while Schabarum talked. But Antonovich's 
chief deputy, Tom Silver, said later that the supervisor was keeping an open 
mind on the property's fate. 
</P>
<P>
"We really haven't formulated any view," Silver said. "We are still looking at 
the reports as they come down." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Antonovich favored some type of development, Silver responded: 
"All things being equal, we should get some revenue out of it."

REVOLT SPREADS; 
</P>
<P>
TALL HOUSES ON TINY LOTS RAISE NEW OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A revolt against big houses on tiny lots that started two years ago in Woodland 
Hills spread over the hill into Topanga Canyon on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials asked for a review of small-lot development in the 
canyon, where builders are constructing large homes on tent-sized parcels that 
were carved out 60 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors voted 4 to 0 to ask the Planning Commission to come up with 
ways to control the development of more than 1,000 lots that at one time had 
been the sites of weekend cabins. 
</P>
<P>
Similar problems with about 2,000 former cabin sites around the Woodland Hills 
Country Club led to a moratorium on the development of such lots two years ago 
by the Los Angeles City Council. The moratorium was extended a second year. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, city officials said they are considering controls for a small-lot 
subdivision in the Sherman Oaks area. 
</P>
<P>
County planners said they do not know how many such lots exist in Topanga 
Canyon. However, they said, there are about 3,600 small parcels in the 
hillsides southwest of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Up 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sites are only 1,000 square feet in size; others are on steep, 
barely accessible lots, they said. 
</P>
<P>
As land values have skyrocketed, lots once deemed impossible to build on have 
been acquired by developers constructing houses that are tall, if not wide. 
</P>
<P>
In Topanga Canyon, five such houses have been built on Medley Lane, a short 
street perched high above Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Topanga's Fernwood area. 
Another 45 lots exist, community leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
A motion introduced Tuesday by Supervisor Mike Antonovich suggested that the 
county set up a "community standards district" that will "ensure that future 
construction in that area is consistent with the infrastructure and 
environmental capacities of that area." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said he wants county planners to meet with Topanga Canyon residents 
to work out the details of such a district so that the Planning Commission can 
hold hearings within 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
Planner Ron Hoffman said the 1920s-era subdivision lots are legal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Access for Fire Engines 
</P>
<P>
But when modern-size houses are built on the cabin lots, there often is no room 
to park, except on the narrow hillside streets. That means that fire engines 
may not be able to get into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Many Topanga property owners have bought several small adjoining lots and 
combined them, Hoffman said. "The responsible people recognize you can't keep 
the environment that you have there by building intense, urban-sized houses on 
a small lot on a mountainside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said there are also so-called "substandard lots" in Calabasas' Monte 
Nido area, in Agoura's Malibu Lake area, in Chatsworth's Twin Lakes region and 
in the Newhall area's Val Verde section. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Glaser, president of the Topanga Town Council, said his group plans to 
work with county planners to set up new development rules. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the 'Laurel Canyonization' of Topanga," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Town Council sent former president Jan Moore to San Francisco last week to 
argue against further construction on Medley Lane's small lots at a state 
Coastal Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
However, the commission postponed the matter, Moore said.

<P>
PADRES MAY STILL SURPRISE, BUT SPRING TO BE MELLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granted, we could be talking a major trade and a major position change. If a 
fan of the Padres lies down Sunday and takes a 42-day nap, he could wake up to 
find Dale Murphy in his outfield and Carmelo Martinez as his third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
But before further explaining what might happen to the Padres this spring 
training, in their first steps toward trying to fulfill all those skyscraper 
expectations, it is more important to note what will not happen. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no daily two-mile run (meaning there will be no veterans 
disappearing in the middle of that run to get sick). 
</P>
<P>
There will be no fines for excess weight (meaning there will be no pitchers 
starving themselves into throwing Lean Cuisine fastballs). 
</P>
<P>
There will be no workouts that last longer than Senate confirmation hearings 
(meaning there will be no players who wish the manager dead). 
</P>
<P>
There will be real competition for only a couple of jobs (meaning a veteran 
might even offer a rookie a ride back to the hotel, perhaps later even speaking 
to him). 
</P>
<P>
What there will be, beginning at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Ray A. Kroc Baseball 
Complex in Yuma, Ariz., and continuing until camp breaks 42 days later, is 
common sense baseball. It is Manager Jack McKeon's trademark and will serve as 
his first testament as he runs a big-league spring training for the first time 
in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in quality time -- get the players in, get them their work and get 
them out," said McKeon, doing this sort of thing for the first time since 1978, 
when he directed the Oakland A's. "Our job is to get them in good condition, 
mentally and physically, and that's it. There shouldn't be any pressure here. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys don't need to prove anything but that they can be ready for the 
start of the season. That's what we're here for. Not for the spring, but for 
the start of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bowa infused Yuma with a different sort of atmosphere the past two years 
-- "creative tension" is a nice way to describe it -- and promptly led them to 
five consecutive losses to open each of the past two regular seasons. McKeon 
watched both camps from outside the door of his general manager's office and 
decided that if he ever moved around the corner and into a uniform, things 
would be different. So they will be. 
</P>
<P>
Workouts will not exceed 3 1/2 hours. Players will rarely be standing around, 
making use of as many as four diamonds at once, even if it cramps the minor 
leaguers. Players will know their roles and be asked only to prepare for those 
roles, not to justify them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to tear my hair out and raise hell over a lost exhibition game," 
McKeon said. "I'm not going to go nuts over some kid who is impressive in the 
spring because he's been playing all winter. I'm going to let everybody get 
tuned up gradually." 
</P>
<P>
This theory is easier to implement because he knows who "everybody" is going to 
be. Of the 42 players in camp, at least 21 have the 24-man squad made. 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't running a tryout camp," McKeon said. "I know what my guys can do." 
</P>
<P>
The following synopsis of his guys could change radically if McKeon is able to 
pick up the one hitter his club needs to move from National League Western 
Division contenders to favorites. The Padres hoped to have a deal this winter, 
but other teams apparently want to see how catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., last 
season's minor league player of the year and top commodity, has survived 
August's arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Look for Alomar Jr. to get sufficient playing time, and look for any deal to 
happen in the middle of March, after the Padre complete their annual tour of 
the Phoenix-area camps and many clubs have had a peek. 
</P>
<P>
The leading candidate for acquisition is still Atlanta's Dale Murphy, which 
would cost the Padres Alomar Jr., outfielder John Kruk and couple of prospects. 
Failing that, McKeon might settle for Seattle's power-hitting third baseman, 
Jim Presley, or even work a deal for Mariner pitcher Mark Langston and top 
young outfielder Mickey Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
But at this point, barring McKeon's next miracle, here's how the roster looks: 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 10 pitchers have it made. The five starters will be Eric Show, 
Bruce Hurst, Ed Whitson, Dennis Rasmussen and Walt Terrell. Four of the five 
relievers will be Mark Davis, Dave Leiper, Greg Booker and Mark Grant. 
</P>
<P>
The battle will be for the fifth reliever spot, between rookie right-hander 
Greg Harris and newly acquired left-hander Pat Clements. The inside track 
belongs to Harris, who went 2-0 with a 1.50 ERA in three big-league appearances 
late last year. He would begin as a long reliever and become a starter if any 
of the five falter. 
</P>
<P>
"We know Harris can pitch in the big leagues, why should he have to go back to 
triple-A?" asked Pat Dobson, the pitching coach. "Even if he doesn't pitch a 
lot right away, he will be of more use to us in the big leagues. Look at Candy 
Sierra." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sierra came from double-A to make the team by surprise, and even 
though he didn't pitch well, the Padres were able to use him to acquire Dennis 
Rasmussen from Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
"You think we would have gotten Rasmussen if Sierra were still in triple-A?" 
Dobson asked. "No way." 
</P>
<P>
Left-handed Clements was 6-7 with a 2.75 ERA last year with triple-A Columbus, 
the New York Yankees farm team. In just six appearances in New York, he was 
racked for a 6.48 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
There will be another staff battle between Mark Grant and Greg Booker. The 
winner will start the season as the right-handed set-up man for Mark Davis and 
be the right-handed stopper when Davis falters. The loser will be a mop-up man, 
a role held by Booker last year before he made two fine starts at the end of 
the season, allowing just two runs in 11 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Grant is ready for a good relief role; last year he finally had an 
idea of what he was doing," Dobson said. "But then, late in the year, Book also 
got the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Benito Santiago will be the starting catcher, and either Sandy Alomar Jr. or 
Mark Parent will be his backup, depending on whom is traded. McKeon wants to 
make this clear before Santiago, who is sometimes insecure, begins looking over 
at Alomar Jr. and forgetting about playing. 
</P>
<P>
"Benny is my catcher, period," McKeon said. "There should be no problems 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Said Santiago earlier this winter from his home in Jauca, Puerto Rico: "I know 
Sandy will be there, but I can't let that be my concern. I know what I have 
done. All I must care about is the start of the season. I have matured too much 
to worry about anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of the infield is set, with Jack Clark at first base, Roberto 
Alomar at second and Garry Templeton and triple-A star Mike Brumley platooning 
at shortstop. McKeon tried all winter to get a power-hitting third baseman but, 
despite entering the spring with the platoon of Randy Ready and Tim Flannery, 
may try something else there. 
</P>
<P>
As in last year's left fielder Carmelo Martinez. He has played left, right, 
first base . . . but never third. 
</P>
<P>
"He will play a few games there, yeah," McKeon confirmed. "He has good 
infielder skills, and if he gets comfortable there, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Martinez took ground balls at third during many batting practices last year and 
was as impressive as he is at first, where he possesses one of the quickest 
gloves in the league. But then he would have pitched batting practice if they 
let him. As of a month ago, he had no idea what McKeon had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard anything about third base, but I try to be ready there, 
everywhere, just so I can get into the lineup," Martinez said earlier this 
winter from his home in Dorado, P.R. "I like Jack, I will do what he says. If 
if gets me more swings, great." 
</P>
<P>
If Martinez does make the switch, both Ready and Flannery would still be 
valuable role players. There may be another backup infield spot open, for which 
minor league stars Bip Roberts or Joey Cora would be candidates. But both may 
be traded by then. 
</P>
<P>
The outfield contains Tony Gwynn in center, John Kruk in right and, at least 
for now, Martinez in left. Marvell Wynne will return as a backup. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves one, maybe two open spots, depending on what happens to Roberts, 
whose value increases because he also plays the infield. The leader for one 
spot would be Shawn Abner, whom McKeon feels has never had a steady big-league 
chance. Another candidate would be Gerald Clark, who could be the camp's 
surprise; he showed flashes last September, hitting a double with three RBIs in 
his first 15 big-league at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
The real outfield battle might be for comfort; Gwynn must get used to being an 
everyday center fielder, and Kruk will be rehabilitating his left knee, which 
he injured jogging last month. Although he should be ready in a couple of 
weeks, Kruk still has a slight limp.

O'MEARA STANDS ALONE AT FINISH OF SHOOTOUT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two and a half weeks ago, Escondido's Mark O'Meara lofted a 93-yard third shot 
with his sand wedge that ended 10 feet above the 72nd hole, made the putt for a 
birdie and won the $180,000 first prize at the AT&amp;T National Pro-Am at 
Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon at Torrey Pines, O'Meara lofted an 88-yard third shot with 
his sand wedge that ended 10 feet below the last hole, made the putt for a 
birdie and won $3,000 and first place in the 10-man Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Shootout on the South Course. 
</P>
<P>
"I was actually just as nervous over this one as I was at Pebble Beach," 
O'Meara said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Sure you were, Mark. And Mac O'Grady rooms on the road with PGA Commissioner 
Deane Beman. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful O'Grady was one of nine other touring pros that O'Meara outlasted 
in the popular nine-hole shootout format, which eliminates one player on each 
hole until two remain with a hole to play. 
</P>
<P>
Long-hitting Joey Sindelar parred the last hole to finish second. Mark Wiebe, 
raised in Escondido, finished third. The shootout serves as a warmup of sorts 
for the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, which begins Thursday on Torrey Lines 
North and South. The final 36 holes, scheduled for the weekend, will be played 
on the tougher South course. 
</P>
<P>
O'Grady, who finished second in last year's shootout at Torrey Pines while 
playing left-handed, bowed out on the fourth hole with a double bogey after a 
poor pitch. He played right-handed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Couples birdied three of the first four holes but said bye-bye when he 
three-putted the par-four fifth. Defending tournament champion Steve Pate lost 
a chip-off to Jay Haas on the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara, 32, is fourth on the tour money list after six events this year with 
earnings of $194,500. 
</P>
<P>
The long driving competition was a misnomer of sorts. Ten players launched two 
tee shots apiece on the first hole on the South course. The winner of the event 
was Bill Sander at 278 yards. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, that's a long drive. But not by the standards of the PGA tour 
professionals. Andy Bean, the longest driver on tour in 1985, averaged 278 
yards off the tee that year. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place finisher Tuesday was Davis Love III at 265. Sander won $3,500 
for his effort. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the relatively short drives was a lively breeze blowing into the 
players' faces and wet ground that kept the balls from rolling more than a few 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the celebrity competition was former Charger tight end Eric 
Sievers (235 yards). Sievers' winning drive was 27 yards farther than the 
last-place drive of pro Duffy Waldorf. Waldorf snap-hooked both his attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The glamour pairing for today's pro-am will tee off on No. 1 on the North 
Course. The group: former President Gerald Ford, entertainer Bob Hope, Charger 
owner Alex Spanos and businessman Leon Parma. The pro: Craig Stadler. Starting 
time: 10:40. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most interesting group is the one that will tee off on No. 10 
on the South course at 7:45. The pro is Tom Sieckmann. The celebrity is Steve 
Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
But the hero in the group is Glenn Ankton, 40, of Oceanside. Both of Ankton's 
legs were blown off just above the knee by a land mine in Vietnam in 1968. He 
plays with prosthetic devices on both legs and regularly shoots in the low 70s. 
</P>
<P>
For a long time, one of his goals has been to play in a pro-am. When people 
around Oceanside heard about it, they raised the $2,250 it costs to play as an 
amateur in the event. Maybe next year, tournament officials will invite him 
back as a celebrity so he can play for free. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Thursday through Sunday, tournament sponsor Shearson Lehman Hutton will present 
a zero coupon Treasury certificate (worth $10,000 at maturity) to a spectator. 
The spectator must donate the certificate to a charity. The spectator will also 
be treated to a free round of golf with a PGA touring pro. Shearson Lehman 
Hutton will also present a zero coupon certificate (worth $50,000 at maturity) 
to the low pro Thursday through Friday. In the event of a tie, the coupon value 
will be carried over to the next day. . . . Other celebrities scheduled to 
participate in today's pro-am include Dan Fouts, Hal Linden, Wayne Rogers, 
Claude Akins, John Havlicek, Johnny Bench, Gene Barry and Steve Garvey.

Unheralded Italian Omar Camporese upset second-seeded Miloslav Mecir of 
Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 7-6, Tuesday in the opening round of the $492,500 Stella 
Artois indoor tournament at Milan, Italy. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf surrendered only five points on her serve in a 6-1, 6-1 victory 
over Stacey Martin, a University of Tennessee freshman. Graf, the world's 
top-ranked player, needed only 39 minutes to win. 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Manuela Maleeva of Bulgaria topped Czechoslovakia's Andrea

MORNING BRIEFING: TOLLNER'S TOP PICK IS PEETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Tollner, former USC football coach, is back in the Southland as quarterback 
coach of the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
So guess who he would like to see the Chargers draft with the No. 8 pick? 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Peete. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have Rodney because the guy is a winner," said Tollner, who 
recruited and coached Peete for the Trojans. "I just know the guy's going to be 
a player in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Some are not sure. There have been indications from scouting combines that 
Peete is too short at 6-feet-1 and that his arm is not strong enough. Tollner 
doesn't buy it. If new Charger Coach Dan Henning asks his opinion about the 
draft, Tollner will gladly offer it in support of Peete. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard those things -- that he's too small and so forth -- from other 
people, but I don't agree with them," he said. "Rodney Peete finds a way to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Add Tollner: He has strong family ties in the area. Son Bruce, a law student, 
lives in Rancho Santa Marguerita. Daughter Tammy is in the advertising business 
in Point Loma. Eldest daughter Linda, a mother of three and a singer, lives in 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a rock-and-roll mama," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce and Tammy are both USC graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"I managed to get them both through school before they got rid of me," Tollner 
joked. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter's days as the New York Mets' everyday catcher may be numbered. 
Manager Davey Johnson has already fired a warning shot across Carter's bow. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who will turn 35 the first week of the season, is in the last year of 
his contract. Last season, Carter's home runs and runs batted in totals dropped 
to 11 and 46, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said Carter needs to start quickly -- or else he'll sit down. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to be aware if (Carter) is not up to par this year," Johnson 
said. "I have to look for a guy who can back up more, especially if Gary 
doesn't get off to a good start." 
</P>
<P>
At 45, Tommy John is a lot older than Carter, but he's still playing, at least 
for a while. John has accepted the New York Yankees' offer of a spring-training 
tryout, which consists of $250,000, a free trip to Florida and a high uniform 
number. 
</P>
<P>
"If I make the team, maybe they'll give me No. 3 or 4," John joked. 
</P>
<P>
John will turn 46 in May and the confidence level in his own family isn't 
extremely high. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a six-week reprieve," John's wife, Sally, told Newsday. "We'll put the 
house on the market in April." 
</P>
<P>
David Checketts has been general manager of the Utah Jazz for five years, but 
when he took the job, he wanted a new team name, something more befitting Salt 
Lake City's image. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to change it," Checketts said. "I mean, why did New Orleans have the 
Saints and Utah have the Jazz? But (former owner) Sam Battistone said, 'You can 
do anything else, but not that.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz is truly a team that has arrived in Salt Lake, Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The seventh game against the Lakers last year (which Utah lost) was the most 
exciting thing to happen here since Brigham Young arrived," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Today's question: What team drafted Dominique Wilkins and then sold his rights 
to Atlanta for $1 million, then drafted Danny Schayes and sold him to Denver 
for $350,000? Answer: The Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Today's question II: Who are Bob Milacki, Pete Harnish, Jose Bautista, Jeff 
Ballard and Dave Schmidt. Answer: The top five starting pitchers of the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Today's question III: Who are Brian Holton, Mike Morgan, Jose Mesa, Oswald 
Peraza and Mike Smith? Answer: The Orioles' next five. 
</P>
<P>
The Tyson-Givens soap opera is apparently nearing its final chapter. 
</P>
<P>
All right, stop with the applause. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and Don King, boarded a jet 
bound for Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic, where Tyson's divorce with 
Robin Givens was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just be thankful he wasn't able to drive there. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
Bill White, on why he sought the position of National League president: "If you 
ever worked 18 years with (New York Yankee broadcaster Phil) Rizzuto you'd know 
my motivation. How would you like to work 18 years with a guy who still doesn't 
know your first name."

FULL FIELDS EXPECTED FOR 2 HALIBUT DERBIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California halibut are beginning to spawn in Santa Monica Bay, so a lot of 
fishermen will be signing up for two major tournaments in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
What this means is added fishing pressure, although nothing that warrants 
concern, according to marine biologist Steve Crooke. Nevertheless, the growing 
popularity of the annual events has officials of the original halibut derby 
taking a conservation approach to this year's event. The other is open to 
anyone interested. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, chairman of the 15th annual Marina del Rey Halibut Derby, 
scheduled March 18-19, said this year's event will be limited to 1,200 
participants and the format will be designed to lessen the strain on the 
species. 
</P>
<P>
"We will only weigh in the heaviest fish," he said. "And we encourage people to 
let those (that are smaller than previously caught halibut) go." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Bay Halibut Derby, on the other hand, awards prizes for the 
top three fish, and raffle tickets for each legal halibut -- 22 inches or 
longer -- caught. Tournament officials are expecting more than 2,200 fishermen 
April 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that they are encouraging people to kill fish," Lambert said of 
the Santa Monica contest. "Nobody is going to let a 23-inch fish go. If they 
do, they might lose a prize." 
</P>
<P>
John Borget, chairman of the April event, disputed that, saying that 
rod-and-reel fishermen can't impact the fishery, and pointed out that his 
tournament has donated about $24,000 to the Department of Fish and Game's 
halibut hatchery project in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Said Crooke: "There might be some extra pressure, and more hooking fatalities 
(among released fish) than normal, but I think the size limit adequately 
protects the resource." 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from both tournaments will go to charities and conservation groups, 
and each will award $25,000 in cash and prizes to participants. Applications 
are available at most tackle stores. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, planning is under way for a multi-species tournament in Santa Monica 
Bay this June, with the objective of saving the bay from further pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Tournament organizer Tom Woods said that more than 16 fishing clubs -- with 
membership ranging from 20 to 80 members -- have already signed up for the 
event, and proceeds will go directly to the conservation group, Heal the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody gets disgusted with all the plastic and other pollution in the bay," 
Woods said. "Either we confront the problem or we'll be driven out. Maybe this 
will put some pressure on City Hall to do something about the problem." 
</P>
<P>
California deer hunting in 1988 was down from the previous year, both in the 
number of deer killed and the number of hunters in the field, the DFG said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 260,755 deer tags were sold and hunters killed 25,039 deer for a 
success rate slightly less than 10%. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, 277,116 tags were sold and hunters shot 25,864 deer. 
</P>
<P>
The number of deer taken legally by hunters has dropped each year since 1984, 
when 32,190 deer were killed, but DFG officials said the success rate has 
remained fairly constant at about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
In June of 1974, Jack Harrington made fishing history when he became the first 
rod-and-reel fisherman to catch a blue marlin weighing more than 1,000 pounds 
in the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The International Game Fish Assn. reports that in 1988, Atlantic fishermen 
caught four 1,000-pound marlin. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth of the "granders," was taken in the waters off St. Thomas, U.S. 
Virgin Islands, aboard Capt. Bob Kiley's Lethal Weapon. Kiley was attempting to 
boat his 100th marlin of the year when the 1,004-pound fish struck -- and was 
successfully landed -- last Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with growing environmental problems caused by discarded plastic, 
researchers at a Japanese government laboratory have reportedly succeeded in 
making biodegradable "plastic" from shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
The International Game Fish Assn. says that Japan's Ministry of Trade and 
Industry will soon launch a $70-million biotechnology project this year to cope 
with "the scourge of plastic waste." 
</P>
<P>
Commercial fishermen have added a new weapon to their technological arsenal: a 
radar system that enables them to detect birds -- and differentiate birds from 
rain -- from as far away as 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hookup, a saltwater fishing publication, some captains attribute 
up to 30% of their catches to the new equipment. Birds generally congregate 
near schooling fish. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
Classes in offshore and big game fishing, taught by Al Zapanta, are being held 
on Tuesday nights at East L.A. College. For information call (213) 265-8793. .

TICKETS FOR SAN DIEGO DAVIS CUP MATCH IN GREAT DEMAND

It has been six days since the Greater San Diego Sports Assn. began taking 
phone orders for the April 7-9 Davis Cup, when the United States will meet 
France in the Sports Arena, and 6,000 tickets already have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been inundated with calls," said John Reid, executive director of the 
sports association. "The Monday after the announcement was made we got so many 
calls, no one got through. It was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The United States Tennis Assn. announced on Feb. 4 in Ft. Myers, Fla., that San 
Diego had been awarded the cup match, and the GSDSA was immediately swamped. 
The association added three phone lines -- "We wanted to take advantage of the 
demand," Reid said -- to serve the tennis-hungry public. 
</P>
<P>
According to promoter Irv Grossman, there are approximately 1,500 tickets left, 
but the association will take orders beyond the arena's 8,500 configuration. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are being sold in a three-day package, with box seats selling for $120, 
loge for $90 and terrace seating $60. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are disappointed because choice locations have been sold," 
Grossman said, "but we do have a waiting list."

NORTH HOLLYWOOD'S ROCHA ENCOUNTERS DIFFICULTY MASTERING ENGLISH BUT HER PLAY 
SPEAKS VOLUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rich Allen, North Hollywood High girls' basketball coach, quickly draws a play 
during a timeout in a crucial game against archrival Reseda. He shouts 
instructions, uses arm motions for emphasis and offers words of encouragement 
before the minute timeout had expired. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, are there any questions?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
His top player, Claudia Rocha, looked puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
She understands the X's and O's diagrammed on a clipboard by her coach. It's 
the rest of the letters in the alphabet that give her trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I know only a few words he's saying," Rocha said. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha had no trouble understanding her coaches last season when she played for 
a high school and a national team in Mexico. It wasn't until she moved to North 
Hollywood with her mother and sisters last summer that she needed an 
interpreter to understand the meaning of traveling. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha speaks very little English. Her coach and teammates struggle to 
understand her. But they have had little trouble understanding that Rocha's 
scoring and rebounding have translated into another championship season. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood, a finalist in the City 3-A Division the past two seasons, 
finished as co-champion in the Mid-Valley League after upsetting Reseda last 
week. The Huskies, 16-4 overall and 9-1 in league play, won a coin flip against 
Reseda to become the league's top-seeded team. They will play host to Dorsey on 
Friday at 5:30 p.m. in the first round of the 4-A Division playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha, a 5-11 junior, didn't start out as the team's best player, but she 
finished with the best statistics. She leads the team in scoring (16.8 points a 
game) and rebounding (10.1). She set a school record for field-goal percentage, 
making 142 of 252 shots (56%) and has scored 18 or more points in her past 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
And she has become the school's most popular Mexican import. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that so many people know me," Rocha said through an interpreter. 
"People come up to me at school and they say, 'Hi, you must be Claudia.' I 
didn't know anyone other than a few close friends until I joined the team." 
</P>
<P>
Allen discovered Rocha shooting at North Hollywood Park two summers ago when 
she was visiting her father, who lives in North Hollywood. Allen invited her to 
try out for the team when she enrolled at the school last fall. 
</P>
<P>
But Allen needed to find a way to communicate with his new star; he knows only 
a few Spanish phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"I would give her a schedule and she would give me a puzzled look," Allen said. 
"She always asks, 'What uniform? Aqui?' 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest problem was figuring out how she was going to learn our offense," 
he added. "I would sit down with her and diagram plays. She would point and try 
to understand what I was saying. I later found that it was better to walk her 
through the plays in practice." 
</P>
<P>
Allen's unorthodox method of coaching helped Rocha sidestep a language barrier 
and move into the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that because you don't speak the language, you're dumb," he 
added. "Claudia is very intelligent and has been able to pick up things 
incredibly fast." 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Rocha also created an opportunity for a bilingual player to make 
the varsity team. Senior reserve guard Cathy Romero, who is fluent in English 
and Spanish, has contributed more points by keeping Rocha's head in the game. 
She explains plays in Spanish, translates Allen's instructions to Rocha during 
timeouts, and yells encouragement from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to really concentrate when the coach is talking," Romero said. "I have 
to translate what he is saying and learn the plays myself at the same time. I 
worry that I might be missing something." 
</P>
<P>
Romero found her role as an interpreter difficult to accept at first. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt cheated because this was my only chance to play basketball. But Claudia 
is more of a player than I am. I'm helping out the team more by doing this," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha shows her gratitude by cheering her teammates when she sits on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"She tries to say things to us on the court," Romero said. "She'll shriek 'Dale 
bien, Dale bien' and then some other rambling words at the players and they 
give her dirty looks. I tell them, 'Oh, that's Claudia cheering.' " 
</P>
<P>
While Rocha may yell 'do it right, do it right' to her teammates, she was 
treated like she did something wrong after North Hollywood's upset of Alemany, 
a perennial Valley-area power, in its season opener. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the Huskies jumped up and down in celebration, Rocha quietly 
collected her gear and headed to the locker room. Rocha's teammates were 
outraged by her blase attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"Claudia didn't know that was an important game," Allen said. "The team thought 
she didn't care. Now, she asks me before every game if our opponents are good 
or bad." 
</P>
<P>
When she first began playing, Rocha said that she didn't know any English 
except for the word 'coach' and would use sentences like "Coach, banos," which 
means she needs to go to the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha has learned to speak three- or four-word sentences from her English as a 
Second Language class at school. But Rocha said that Allen tutors her in 
practice and deserves credit for helping with her progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to make a mistake," Rocha said through Romero. "Coach would say, 
'Claudia, you know how to say that in English.' " 
</P>
<P>
What words can she say? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm cold. Do you want a cookie? I have to go to work now," she said without an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
While Rocha may be shy about speaking English, she rarely gets nervous during a 
basketball game. She started playing in elementary school in her hometown of 
Saltillo in the Mexican state of Coahuila. 
</P>
<P>
"My first coach taught us to play and not get nervous," Rocha said. "He always 
made it fun to play. He wouldn't keep score and would stop the game if we got 
physical." 
</P>
<P>
Rocha, however, finds some things in the United States that don't make sense in 
any language. 
</P>
<P>
"School is free and food is free, but they make us borrow our uniforms. Why 
can't we keep them?" Rocha asked. "I find that to be strange. We keep our 
uniforms and shoes in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The games are also more physical here and they spend more time on 
conditioning. They teach us to shoot more in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Rocha developed a few unusual habits by American standards and Allen considered 
trying to correct them. She plays defense by pressing her hand against her 
opponents' back, which is accepted behavior in the NBA and in international 
play but not at the high school level. Allen constantly reminds Rocha not to 
hand check her opponents and she frequently gets called for fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha also has a peculiar way of shooting free throws. She stands with one foot 
behind the other and not square to the basket. She shoots the ball from the 
same level as her chin and flicks the ball with her wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"My immediate reaction was to change her stance," Allen said. "And then I saw 
the ball go in the basket. I wanted for her to miss one, but they kept going in 
one after another." 
</P>
<P>
Rocha's free-throw shooting ability has been the most startling part of her 
game. At one point, she was shooting 89% from the line but has since cooled to 
70% (47 for 67). Still, she has only missed two consecutive free throws four 
times in 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha doesn't have the flash or the dazzling moves of teammates Michelle 
Cabaldon, a senior guard, or Jacinda Sweet, a sophomore guard. She prefers to 
jog up and down the court. But when she gets the ball in her hands, she has one 
of the fastest first steps in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Allen learned how to say rapido when he wants Rocha to run fast. "I thought she 
was lazy, but she just paces herself," he said. "There is no wasted motion. 
When she has to run quickly, boy, can she move." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Rocha's shots are taken within eight feet of the basket and they are 
rarely off target. Rocha set a school record for most points in a game with 30 
against Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Rocha, her athletic eligibility will run out before she 
learns how to speak complete sentences in English. She turns 19 in May and will 
be ineligible to play next season. 
</P>
<P>
Rocha, however, isn't concerned that her high school career will end. She said 
she has been offered a basketball scholarship at the Autonomous University of 
Coahuila in Saltillo.

PUNCHLESS CSUN WOMEN SETTLE FOR SPLIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Cal State Northridge softball team split a nonconference double-header 
against Cal Poly Pomona on Tuesday at Northridge, defeating the Lady Broncos, 
3-0, in the first game before falling, 4-2 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Dickmann's two-hit pitching masked the lack of Northridge offense in the 
opener, but when Lady Matador pitching failed early in the second game, the 
Lady Matador bats were already in a deep slumber. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Broncos took a 1-0 lead in the second inning of the second game 
against starting pitcher Kate Bennitt but most of their damage the next inning 
against Christy Alves, who replaced Bennitt after a leadoff single in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Alves, a freshman from Burroughs High, recorded two quick outs but lost her 
control, hitting a batter and walking two to force in a run. Heather Lindstrom 
replaced Alves and walked home another run before Holly DeLuca singled in the 
third run of the inning to give Pomona (1-1) a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona's Lori Thompson had a shutout going until Northridge awoke in the 
seventh. The Lady Matadors (2-4) got on the scoreboard when Lisa Hall scored on 
a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Alves followed with a single that scored Erin McGuire to cut the Pomona lead to 
4-2. Michelle Blaha singled and Lisa Erickson was hit by a pitch to load the 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco Coach Carol Sparks had seen enough. And so had the Matadors. Sparks 
called in reliever Caryn Askey, who recorded the final out. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked a bit inexperienced today," Sparks said. "We did some bad things, 
but we did some things I'm proud of, too. In the second game we stayed cool 
under fire." 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Dickmann struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, what can I say. I had it going today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson set up CSUN's first score with a leadoff single in the bottom of the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet-footed outfielder stole second and third, allowing Pam Smith to 
collect her first run batted in of the season with a squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge increased the lead to 2-0 in the third when Anna Getherall singled, 
advanced to second on a sacrifice and scored on an an error. The Lady Matadors 
scored their final run in the fourth when Hall doubled home catcher Char 
Schmitt, who had reached third on a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson had two hits for the Lady Matadors, but the game belonged to Dickmann. 
</P>
<P>
"I was throwing hard today today," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Dickmann (2-2) walked seven -- including DeLuca three times -- but was 
close to unhittable, allowing only singles to Kathy Twisselman and Nicky Luce 
in the fifth.

CONTRERAS MAY JOIN RIO MESA FOOTBALL PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Westlake High football Coach George Contreras may join the Rio Mesa High 
staff next season as an assistant if he can secure a transfer from Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa Coach John Reardon asked Contreras to join his staff six weeks ago and 
Contreras expressed interest pending a change in his teaching status. Rio Mesa 
assistants Paul Petrich and Brian Hustad resigned at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras, who teaches physical education and economics at Westlake, has 
applied for a teaching position at Rio Mesa, a school in the Oxnard Union High 
School District. He also has asked for an intradistrict transfer from Westlake 
to Conejo Valley High, the only continuation school in the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
"To be an on-campus teacher at one school and coach at a different school, 
ethically, I would have problems with that," Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
Contreras lives in Camarillo and son Andy played quarterback on the Rio Mesa 
freshman team last fall. Mike, Contreras' second son, is a seventh-grader who 
is expected to enroll at Rio Mesa in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Moving out of the Conejo district would mean loss of seniority and a pay cut, 
but Contreras said that he would make the move to keep involved in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"When I resigned three months ago, I said I wasn't burned out on coaching," he 
said. "I just wanted to be able to watch my sons play high school football. If 
I made the move, I'd get that chance." 
</P>
<P>
Contreras, the only coach in Westlake's history, resigned in December after 
compiling a 58-57 record in 11 seasons. No replacement has been named. JOHN

GRANADA HILLS AVOIDS DATE WITH CRENSHAW IN 1ST ROUND OF PLAYOFFS

By virtue of its strong finish, Granada Hills High was granted a reprieve of 
sorts Tuesday and will not have to face highly regarded Crenshaw in the first 
round of the boys' City Section 4-A Division basketball playoffs Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, which had fallen into last place in the North Valley League, won 
its last two games with upsets of Kennedy and Taft. The Highlanders finished 
tied for third in league play with Kennedy at 5-5 but won a coin toss Tuesday 
to decide the league's third-place representative. All 4-A boys' teams qualify 
for postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (13-8) will play at Dorsey, although the site might be switched 
to Hamilton High to accommodate more spectators, according to Lee Joseph, a 
City Section administrator. Kennedy (12-8), loser of four consecutive games, 
will play at Crenshaw, the division's No. 3-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 4-A Division, North Hollywood (16-4) won a coin toss and will 
enter the playoffs as the Mid-Valley League's first-place representative. The 
Huskies will play host to Dorsey on Friday. Reseda (14-3), which tied North 
Hollywood in league play with a record of 9-1, will play at Palisades. STEVE

NOTRE DAME'S JONES PLAYS TO A DWINDLING AUDIENCE DESPITE LEADERSHIP ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Jones dribbles along wearing the navy blue and gold of Notre Dame High. 
The only thing missing is a sign around his neck: 
</P>
<P>
 Take me! 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why," Jones said, "but I guess I've been overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a 6-foot-3 senior point guard, is referring to college scouts. Despite 
averaging a team-high 26.1 points a game and attracting the interest of some 
Division I colleges, Jones, one of the best players in the Valley area, has not 
had a scholarship offer. And the number of schools that are interested, Jones 
said, is dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can do," he said, "is keep playing." 
</P>
<P>
Jones has all but carried Notre Dame through the season and into the first 
round of the Southern Section 3-A Division playoffs. The Knights (16-8), San 
Fernando Valley League champions and winners of 12 in a row, play host to 
Western of Anaheim at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Jones ranks third among Valley scoring leaders. He has scored 30 or more points 
in a game eight times, including a career-high 36 last week in the Knights' 
81-72 win over Bell-Jeff that clinched the league's inaugural title. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a couple of streaks when he just went off," Notre Dame Coach Mick 
Cady said. "He's carried us." 
</P>
<P>
During the nonleague season, Jones hauled some heavy cargo, averaging 25 points 
a game while teammates Ken Hicks and Errol Small were sidelined because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of pressure," Jones said. "I expected myself to have a good 
year, but I didn't expect to have to carry the load." 
</P>
<P>
Neither did he expect to be overlooked by colleges before the season began. 
While several of the area's best players -- Cleveland's Adonis Jordan (Kansas) 
and Lucious Harris (Cal State Long Beach), Taft's Dedan Thomas (Nevada Las 
Vegas) and El Camino Real's Brent Lofton (Utah State), among others -- signed 
during the preseason signing period, Jones received no offers. 
</P>
<P>
"New Mexico State was on me," Jones said. "It seemed like they were going to 
offer me a scholarship. But they pulled back. I probably wouldn't have signed 
with them anyway. It didn't interest me." 
</P>
<P>
Is Jones just a blue chip designed to slip through the Division I cracks? 
</P>
<P>
"Gee, it seems pretty strange to me," said Hicks, Jones' backcourt partner who 
signed with Stanford before the season. "I can't figure it out at all. He's got 
the grades and he's a good player." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cady: "I was talking to an assistant at UC Irvine and he told me Brian is 
one of the top 20 kids unsigned west of the Mississippi. He's a hot prospect." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Jones, who maintains a 3.1 grade-point average and has scored above 
the minimum 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test to satisfy college eligibility 
requirements, might be on the verge of signing. Baylor and Northwestern 
currently are studying film of Jones and appear interested, Cady said. Irvine, 
Portland and Texas El Paso also have maintained contact. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't worry me," Jones said. "I think about it just a little." 
</P>
<P>
Jones admittedly is bothered more by the number of schools that no longer 
appear interested. Arizona, California, New Mexico State, Pepperdine and USC, 
Jones said, all have stopped calling. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to go to Pepperdine," Jones said. "For a while they were 
interested, but they just backed off. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess maybe I don't fill some teams' needs. I think I'm Division I, but if 
they don't see it that way, that's their problem. I figure my grades are pretty 
good, so if a school doesn't recognize me, I can get in with my grades." 
</P>
<P>
And his numbers on the court won't hurt. Jones, a three-year varsity player, is 
shooting 52.8% (219 of 415) from the field this season and 50.5% (44 of 87) 
from behind the three-point line. From the free-throw line, Jones is shooting 
76.8% (146 of 190). 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's just a little up in the air," Cady said. "He's just going to 
wait until the end of the season and then make a decision. No way will he go 
unsigned."

UNIVERSITY CITY'S PRICE REINSTATED UNTIL AT LEAST MARCH 1

University City's top basketball player, Jerome Price, will be allowed to 
return to the team after a temporary restraining order was granted against the 
California Interscholastic Federation Tuesday in a San Diego Superior Court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Price was declared ineligible by Kendall Webb, San Diego Section commissioner, 
following Price's participation in the Gus Macker three-on-three tournament 
Jan. 28-29, which Webb said was a violation of CIF rules. A hearing has been 
scheduled for March 1 by Judge William C. Pate to determine if an injunction 
should be issued to permanently reinstate Price on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said the decision disappointed him because he thinks it will open 
possibilities for lawsuits against the CIF for the purpose of challenging 
rules. The court proceedings will cost the CIF approximately $2,500, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge turned to an issue other than the violation of the rule on which to 
base his decision," Webb said. "He brought up the possibility of infringement 
of constitutional rights of an individual." 
</P>
<P>
Webb said there will be no penalty levied against the University City 
basketball team for games in which Price plays between now and March 1, 
regardless of the outcome of the next hearing. Playoffs start Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Webb also said he was surprised by Tuesday's decision in light of a 
conversation he had with Pate on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He acknowledged that there was no question the violation had occurred," Webb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Price's attorney, Tim MacNeil, said Pate questioned the clarity of CIF Rule 
600, which states that a high school player becomes ineligible if he 
participates on "outside" team in the same sport during that season. 
</P>
<P>
"He said the more he thinks about it, the more he thinks the rule doesn't make 
sense the way it is written," MacNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
Price said MacNeil told him last week he had a good chance to win, but he 
wasn't sure what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have my hopes up," he said. "It feels good to be back with the team 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Medigovich, University City coach, said the decision may prompt other 
schools to take action against the CIF for other disqualifications that were 
made after the Gus Macker tournament. Also declared ineligible were two St. 
Augustine varsity players, a USDHS varsity player and two USDHS junior varsity 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Murphy, the USDHS coach, said he would contact Webb this morning to 
inquire about the status of varsity player Adam Smith, but Webb said: "It won't 
affect the other students because it was not a class-action suit. This is only 
a temporary restraining order, not a decision. So the students are still in 
violation of Rule 600. I don't have the authority to wave (the ineligibility 
decision) for the others." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Eveleth, coach of La Jolla, which will play University City today, 
expressed concern over the effect the decision could have on high school 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're telling the youth of America is 'Hey, you can screw up, and we'll 
take it to court, and some bleeding heart judge will side with you,' " Eveleth 
said.

MONTE VISTA WINS TITLE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME

Joe McNaull, the center for the Monte Vista High School basketball team, knew 
it was going in. Coach Zack Peck knew as well. The one thing forward Jeff 
Polinsky wasn't sure of was the time on the clock when the soft left-handed 
jumper left his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between :0001 and 00:00 is about right. The shot hit nothing but net 
to give Monte Vista a 38-37 victory over Helix and the championship of the 
Grossmont League's 3-A Division Tuesday evening at Monte Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what time it was," Polinsky said after crawling out from under a 
pile of teammates and fans. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:54 remaining, it didn't appear as if No. 8 Monte Vista would get a 
chance to shoot to win. With McNaull, a 6-foot-9 junior, spending 5:39 through 
the middle of the second half on the bench with four fouls, Helix (16-6, 6-2) 
had gone on a 11-2 run to take a 35-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
McNaull left the game with 2:53 remaining in the third quarter. The run began 
with Helix's 6-8 senior center, John Pressler, scoring at the buzzer to end the 
period and had reached 9-2 when Peck put McNaull back in with 5:14 to play. But 
by the time the run ended on a rebound basket by Chris Masilon, Monte Vista had 
begun to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
Helix abandoned the patient offense that allowed it to stay in the game and 
started jamming the ball inside to Pressler, who went straight after McNaull 
looking for the fifth foul. The first time, Pressler dribbled the ball off his 
foot. The next four times, Pressler leaned into McNaull as he shot. But McNaull 
held his ground, and the shots wouldn't fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were going to try to foul me out," McNaull said. "I had to keep my 
feet and not commit any stupid fouls." 
</P>
<P>
Only once did someone other than McNaull grab those missed shots, and that was 
when Masilon got his only basket of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Monte Vista then came back. Jason Peters hit a shot in the lane with 2:30 to 
play to cut the deficit to 35-34. After rebounding a Pressler miss, McNaull 
came down and drilled a 10-foot baseline turnaround over his counterpart for 
36-35 lead with 1:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Helix called timeout, then went to Pressler. McNaull rebounded, and Monte Vista 
began to stall the final minute away. Helix only had two team fouls, so fouling 
made no sense. Helix needed a steal. 
</P>
<P>
With 15 seconds left, Monte Vista's Curt Howard was trapped by three players in 
a corner at midcourt. Helix's Todd McTrusty stole the ball and drove to the 
basket. Anticipating a foul, he tossed the ball wildly over his head with his 
right hand. To the amazement of most, it went in with 11 seconds left. Monte 
Vista called timeout with 8 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a special play to go inside to (McNaull) and run back door," Polinsky 
said. "Howard screened for me, and I came across and shot the jumper." 
</P>
<P>
There appeared to be confusion as the play unfolded. Polinsky faked and 
dribbled into the lane, but it didn't appear as if he would get the shot off. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff's the guy you want the ball to go to," Peck said. "He's just an excellent 
shooter, he's uncanny." 
</P>
<P>
Polinsky had 14 for Monte Vista (16-4, 8-0), and McNaull added 12 points, five 
rebounds and four blocks. Pressler had 21 points, two blocks and three rebounds 
for Helix. JEFFREY PARENTI

ITT Corp.'s 1988 profit fell 15% to $817 million from a restated $965 million 
last year. Sales totaled $19.4 billion, up 6%. For the fourth quarter, earnings 
totaled $180 million, down from a restated profit of $421 million, on revenue 
of $5.2 billion, up 8%. The New York diversified firm said the annual results 
were reduced by a $41-million after-tax provision primarily for several 
environmental cleanup operations at its Southern Wood Piedmont unit as well as 
reduced tax benefits. The firm noted that operating income at its nine business 
segments and Alcatel N.V., a telecommunications joint venture with a European

<P>
The stock market closed slightly lower Tuesday, erasing the gains of a morning 
rally on profit taking and weakness in bonds and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up more than 15 points in the early 
going, lost 1.25 to close at 2,281.25. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 149.56 million shares, up from 143.52 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The market has been struggling of late amid worries about inflation and rising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Rates rose in the credit markets Tuesday after the Commerce Department reported 
that retail sales rose 0.6% in January, slightly above expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said some traders took the strong growth in retail sales as a fresh 
bit of evidence in the case for tighter credit. 
</P>
<P>
Investors also seemed to be looking ahead uneasily to a series of other 
government reports due later this week, including monthly data Friday on the 
nation's international trade position for December. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ended slightly 
lower on concerns about the difficult situation facing Japan's ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party, which is suffering from a drop in public support. The Nikkei 
225-share index eased 2.43 to 31,982.89, adding to Monday's 146.67-point loss. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices closed higher, lifted by some heavy futures-related 
buying and a strong early trend on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share 
index closed 16.4 points higher at 2,049.1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices also finished lower, pulled down by the sagging dollar in world 
currency trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's 30-year bond lost about 1/2 point, or $5 for every $1,000 in 
face value. Its yield rose to 9.11% from 9.06% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices started the day by advancing, buoyed by news of the 
better-than-expected retail sales in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave some buoyancy to bond buying," said John Sebastian, executive vice 
president of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bonds turned lower around midday, however, pressured by the 
retreat of the dollar. A weaker U.S. currency lowers the value of 
dollar-denominated securities such as bonds and notes. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government 
issues slipped 1/32 point to 1/8 point, intermediate maturities declined 1/8 
point to 7/32 point and long-term issues dropped 7/16 point, according to 
Telerate, a financial data service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 9.25%, unchanged from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
The dollar dropped against most major foreign currencies in a selloff inspired 
in part by speculation that the White House may be at odds with the Federal 
Reserve Board over interest rate policy. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a gold bid of 
$384.40 an ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down from $385.20 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers dumped dollars in favor of West German marks, reasoning that evidence 
of rising inflation in that country might induce the government to drive 
interest rates higher. Higher West German rates would enhance returns on 
mark-denominated holdings. 
</P>
<P>
As trading wound down in New York, the dollar was reported at 1.84325 marks, 
compared to 1.8677 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar came under additional selling pressure as dealers reacted to 
comments by President Bush in a Wall Street Journal interview. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he opposes further tightening in credit conditions to combat 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Barth, a first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said 
Bush's position seemed to differ with that of the central bank even though the 
President said in the interview that he and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan are not 
"far apart at all." 
</P>
<P>
"Some people were disturbed by President Bush's comments," Barth said. "There 
may be a little friction between the White House and the Federal Reserve." 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound closed at $1.7588, more expensive for buyers than 
Monday's late $1.7495. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in New York, a pound fetched $1.77375, compared to $1.7525 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 127.20 Japanese yen, down from 128.30 
yen. In London, the dollar traded higher at 127.37 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to levels late Monday, included: 
126.305 Japanese yen, down from 128.07; 1.56325 Swiss francs, down from 
1.58775; 1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1860, and 6.2715 French francs, 
down from 6.2855. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Soybean and corn futures rose sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade, bolstered 
by talk of overseas demand for both commodities. 
</P>
<P>
In other markets, cattle futures mostly were lower, pork mostly was higher, 
precious metals were mixed and energy futures mostly were lower. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures soared at least 12 cents higher during the session for the 
three contracts pegged for delivery in March, May and July, then settled about 
11 cents higher. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were supported by talk of renewed demand for soy products in Europe and 
a feeling that the futures market has been oversold lately, said Jerry Gidel, 
research director in Chicago of LIT America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Export figures Monday that were on the high side of expectations encouraged 
buying in the CBOT corn pit, Gidel said. 
</P>
<P>
"There also were rumors of new Russian interest in the corn market," said Steve 
Freed, grain analyst in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Recent rains in Midwest growing areas weighed on wheat futures trading, traders 
said.

Laser Corp. said it discontinued the operations of its Optical Computer Inc. 
subsidiary, a marketer of computer-assisted graphics plotters. 
</P>
<P>
Laser said it has been unable to sell OCI, but is still trying to sell certain 
assets. If the company has to write off all assets, the total additional pretax 
loss would be less than $200,000, Laser said.

DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: DESIGN COMPUTERS FINALLY LIVING UP TO EXPECTATIONS

<P>
In the early '80s, advertising hype primed architects for a computer 
revolution. They were led to believe that CAD -- computer aided design -- would 
make them faster, more creative designers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many architects in San Diego and across the nation have a much better 
idea what computers really can and cannot do. They've learned a few lessons, 
sometimes costly ones. After several years of development, the computer 
software and hardware available to architects is only beginning to fulfill the 
early promises made for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole lot of ballyhoo about CAD and what it will do for the 
profession," said architect Richard Sullivan, who chaired a computer interest 
group for the local American Institute of Architects chapter and helped the 
staff at SGPA Planning and Architecture implement computers while he was 
working there. "The first car looked like a horseless carriage without a horse. 
That's the stage CAD is in, using the computer to emulate what can be done by 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just the equipment that has kept the use of computers from 
becoming more widespread among designers. There's been resistance to the 
computerized way of working, especially from older architects weaned on pencils 
and drafting tables. Sullivan said it takes genuine faith and a long-term 
commitment to training before architects get friendly with computers. 
</P>
<P>
Austin Hansen Fehlman Group learned how to implement computers the hard way. In 
1982, the architects paid out $200,000 for a system called RUCAPS, designed to 
run on expensive "mini" computers in the days before the affordable, powerful 
desktop machine, or microcomputer. The equipment proved so complicated that 
many staffers gave up on it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old System Scrapped 
</P>
<P>
"You had to put in so much information about each piece of the building, the 
process got in the way of designing," said architect Don Hansen, one of the 
firm's partners. "Not that we didn't get anything out of it. We used it to 
visualize buildings, even land forms." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Austin Hansen Fehlman has scrapped the old system in favor of software 
called AutoCad, which runs on the less expensive microcomputers. AutoCad, 
originally a simple drafting program, is now used by about 6,000 designers in 
San Diego, according to Focus Computer, a local distributor. Since 1982, the 
software has been updated 11 times, to the point where it is now extremely 
powerful and rapidly becoming the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quicker and easier," Hansen said. "It has 3-D capability, but we don't 
use it much. It's not 100% accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said the computers are especially useful for preparing presentation 
drawings, like the one they made of the new Scripps Clinic building in Rancho 
Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
"The view we chose was the 11th or 13th one we looked at on the computer. We 
fine-tuned the perspectives until we got exactly what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Besides architects like Austin Hansen Fehlman, other San Diego designers are 
finding ways to put computers to work. 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architect Steve Estrada thinks computers enhance his creativity. 
</P>
<P>
"Among some of my people here, if I ask for a design, the initial reaction is 
to get the pencil and sketching paper. There's initial resistance to using the 
computer. They think it's rigid, that it takes away creativity. I've found just 
the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada got so hooked that he equipped his 16-person office with $100,000 worth 
of computers and software. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the large planning projects he's tackled, he bought aerial surveys 
of the sites in computer disc format, loaded them into his computer and laid 
out buildings and landscapes on the terrain displayed on his screen. Details 
like brick patterns or the shape of a swimming pool can quickly be changed 
until the result is pleasing. Estrada finds this much more efficient than 
hand-drawing each alternative. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Combinations 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architects can even buy libraries of plant materials on videotape, 
feed these images into their computers and experiment with different 
combinations, displayed on the computer monitor in color. Estrada takes 
pictures of what's on the computer screen, and uses these slides in 
presentations to clients. 
</P>
<P>
Even though AutoCad is much less cumbersome than first-generation packages like 
the one Austin Hansen Fehlman started out with, some designers feel it too is 
unwieldy. 
</P>
<P>
"I found that the more basic you can get, the better," said architect Kotaro 
Nakamura, a partner in RNP Architecture &amp; Planning. His office uses several 
Apple Macintosh computers, known for being "user friendly," and two basic 
design programs: McDraw II and Schema. Staffers take quickly to the systems. 
They don't have to learn the complex commands required to use AutoCad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nakamura especially likes the system for creating three-dimensional perspective 
drawings of buildings, and for quickly adding stock items like windows and 
doors to plans. These architectural "parts" are stored and can be pulled into a 
drawing by the push of a button. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all this enthusiasm, though, architects seem to agree that the most 
creative aspects of their work still occur using the old-fashioned methods. 
</P>
<P>
"My idea is that creativity shouldn't be limited by the tool," Nakamura said. 
"Computer generated lines are so crisp and precise, they're the antithesis of 
creativity and pure expression. In my mind, nothing is better than drawing 
freehand."

MUSEUM HOPES TO MAKE MOVE TO BALBOA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
SHIFT WOULD MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO MORE CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
Troubled by surveys that show they are serving an increasingly narrow yuppie 
kid market, officials of the Children's Museum of San Diego have proposed a 
plan to move to the site of the crumbling, 74-year-old House of Charm in Balboa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The museum is failing to reach significant numbers of central city and South 
Bay families from its storefront in an enclosed La Jolla shopping mall, its 
director says. According to a 1988 visitor profile, the museum draws about 7% 
of its attendance from South Bay, 9% from East County, 20% from Center City and 
more than 60% from the affluent North County. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had great growth, but the growth has happened mainly in North County 
areas," said James R. (Skip) Pahl, the museum's executive director. "We're not 
accessible to many San Diego families. While La Jolla is beautiful, it's just 
not accessible . . . especially for Hispanic families to visit. It's out of 
their traffic patterns." 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that kids from inner city and lower income families enjoy the 
museum as much or more, museum personnel say, than others. This was 
demonstrated on recent visit by 90 unrepressed kindergartners from Sherman 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The pint-sized museum-goers spread out in this touch-everything institution. 
They climbed into a dentist's chair, handled replicas of a human liver and 
heart, and made beelines to the museum's little stage. 
</P>
<P>
After spotting a rack of clothes backstage, it took one group of kids about two 
nanoseconds before they were feverishly pulling on the once-elegant gowns, the 
battered football pads and helmets or the knee-high firefighters' boots and 
headgear. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away, others performed on camera in the KKID News Room or explored a 
cave. They felt their way through a "sensory" tunnel or built castles in a room 
full of hundreds, if not thousands, of Leggos. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, young Antoinette Murphy said her favorite part was wearing "that 
green dress in the fashion show, the one that had gold on it." 
</P>
<P>
Jairo Miguel, a pupil in Delia Rodriguez-Correa's bilingual class, liked all 
the toys but acknowledged that he was intrigued most of all by a midget 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the wings and the seats and driving it," Jairo said in 
</P>
<P>
Spanish, which Rodriguez-Correa translated. 
</P>
<P>
The key to these kinds of responses and to the growing national success of 
youth museums is that, "when kids relate to objects with all their senses, the 
learning curve is fantastic," Pahl said. The number of children's museums in 
the United States has doubled in the past two years to 400, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibits in the Children's Museum of San Diego are designed primarily for 
kids ages 2 to 12 and play a key role in child development and education, 
museum officials say. Outside of the very limited school visits, children like 
Jairo and Antoinette from Southeast San Diego rarely get to enjoy the 
Children's Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The overwhelming reason for this imbalance, museum officials feel, is that the 
museum is located in the chic La Jolla Village Square. 
</P>
<P>
That site was chosen when mall officials offered free rent on 5,000 square feet 
and plenty of parking, even enough for school buses. Kinney Shoes donated 
three-quarters of the rent on an additional 5,000 square feet. The Kinney lease 
was up in the fall, and the museum is negotiating with the mall for that part 
of its space. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping mall was never envisioned as a permanent site when it opened in 
August, 1983, but the free rent and other amenities were essential for its 
first years, its board members say. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's remoteness to a major portion of San Diego families was pointed up 
in a 1988 Children's Museum survey of adult attendance that revealed that, 
outside of school visits, the museum serves few Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county's Latino population is about 18%, Latinos make up only 5% 
of the Children's Museum attendance, according to the survey. The museum does 
serve all areas of San Diego, especially through its program of school visits, 
but such visits account for only about 34% of last year's attendance of 79,000. 
</P>
<P>
To make the Children's Museum more accessible to more San Diego families and to 
provide room to grow, the directors have formally proposed a costly plan to the 
City of San Diego to move the museum operations into the crumbling House of 
Charm after it is restored. 
</P>
<P>
The move would put the museum in the same traffic pattern occupied by more than 
a dozen Balboa Park cultural institutions. By taking over the two-story park 
structure, the museum would quadruple its total space of 10,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The museum now has only 7,000 square feet of exhibition space, which Pahl says 
is small for a city the size of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Corpus Christi has 53,000 square feet," he said. "San Jose is finishing one at 
42,000 square feet. Brooklyn, the oldest Children's Museum, has 35,000 square 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
Although its annual attendance has climbed to 79,000, the Children's Museum 
trails that in Corpus Christi, which had 165,000 visitors in 1987, and 
Indianapolis, which had a whopping 1.5 million visitors in 1987, according to 
figures compiled by the American Assn. of Youth Museums. 
</P>
<P>
But the Children's Museum has jumped the gun in sending a proposal to the city. 
The city hasn't requested proposals to occupy the House of Charm, but it is 
expected to formally do so soon, a Park and Recreation Department official 
said. There will surely be plenty of proposals, including one from being 
prepared by the San Diego Art Institute, which has occupied a section of the 
building since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Pahl and members of the museum's board of directors said they are 
encouraged that Mayor Maureen O'Connor has named 1989 the Year of the Child. In 
her State of the City address last month, O'Connor even named the House of 
Charm as a site for children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing the mayor refer to the House of Charm as a center for children "was a 
dream come true," museum president Barbara Bry said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was there. Tears were coming down my cheeks. Of course, we'll have to go 
through the whole RFP (request for proposals) process, and nothing's certain." 
</P>
<P>
The museum has proposed that the city raze and restore the exterior shell of 
the 1915 vintage House of Charm and the adjacent colonnade. The museum 
estimates the cost of restoration on the same "footprint" of the existing 
building at $3.9 million, including replication of all architectural facade 
elements, and it would be paid for with revenues from last year's increase in 
the hotel-motel tax. 
</P>
<P>
According to its plan, the museum would raise $3.3 million to pay for the 
interior construction and outfit the building. The proposal calls for central 
themes in the new museum, ranging from exposing children to San Diego's ethnic 
diversity and delving into childhood anxieties, to architecture, science and 
the language arts. 
</P>
<P>
The museum estimates that its attendance would jump at the new location to 
almost 440,000. The Balboa Park site was the overall choice in an April-May 
1988 survey of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to the board of directors inherent in their proposal is 
considerable, Bry acknowledged. "Our board is not 'old San Diego,' " she said. 
"It's not old, rich money, but a board of hard-working professionals. That's 
what's made the board go. They really do what they want." 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal calls for quite a financial leap. Although board members are 
encouraged by the progress the museum has made since its opening, they 
acknowledge they have to do a better job of marketing it. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools know about it," said founding board member Sandra Arkin, "but the 
people in the general community don't."

'LAWRENCE' RESTORED: NOTHING CAN TOUCH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
From the suppressed excitement in its overture to the last moments as that 
prophetic motorcyclist overtakes Lawrence's open car in the desert, David 
Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" (Cineplex Odeon, Century City), restored to its 
full clarity and magnificence, is one of the Seven Wonders of the cinematic 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to come along since "Lawrence's" release in 1962 has diminished the 
power of cameraman F.A. (Freddie) Young's desert vistas. Stretched out in 
70-millimeter Super Panavision vastness, the movie's most pungent memory has 
lost nothing to time as a shimmering pin point in the center of the screen 
becomes clearer and clearer and can finally be read as a man, all in black, on 
camelback, riding straight toward the camera. It's still the greatest actor's 
entrance in movies, the one that launched Omar Sharif into American moviegoing 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
But Lean never makes haunting pictures for their own sake; he uses scale to 
sculpt character, and as our themes shrink along with our screens, the joy of 
storytelling on this epic scale is thrilling. It couldn't have been an easy 
story to shape. Thomas Edward Lawrence was a scholar, a soldier, a hero with 
notable flaws and a man whom Lowell Thomas said had "a genius for backing into 
the limelight." 
</P>
<P>
In his literate, subtle screenplay from Lawrence's autobiography, "The Seven 
Pillars of Wisdom," Robert Bolt has kept all of Lawrence's complexities: his 
reticences and his flair for bravura; his compassion and the blood lust that 
came on him after his capture by a Turkish Bey at Deraa. And in fleshing out 
the man, Peter O'Toole has fatally colored our vision of Lawrence; the 5-foot-4 
"El Aurens" will forever live as a 6-foot 2 gold-blond demigod. 
</P>
<P>
What has changed? We're finally able to take O'Toole's unwavering charisma for 
granted and look beyond him to the film's uncommonly compassionate and shaded 
portrayal of these Arab leaders. They emerge as proud, brave, ancient, 
honorable: Alec Guinness' elegantly ironic Prince Feisel or Sharif's firebrand 
Sherif Ali, fascinating alternatives to the all-purpose villainy that has been 
the Arabs' lot on screen for so long. The intensity of Lawrence's exchanges 
with these sinuous, seductive men make us forget completely that it is a film 
without women. 
</P>
<P>
Bolt has been only moderately successful in explaining what was taking place 
historically: a revolt by the Arabs against the occupying Turks during World 
War I. Bolt is better at laying out Lawrence's passion to create an Arab 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bolt and Lean are best at change-ups, at shifting down from scenic vastness to 
intimate, highly charged moments between two or three characters. Wonderful 
vignettes emerge: Claude Raines at his Cheshire-cat best as the foreign office 
politician Dryden; Jack Hawkins' shrewdly manipulative Gen. Allenby, and Jose 
Ferrer's indelible Turkish Bey, whose beating of Lawrence reveals to the 
Englishman two sides to himself that he finds unendurable: a human side and a 
streak of masochism. 
</P>
<P>
That last trait, of pleasure in punishing his body, has been hinted at in a 
reinstated early, crucial scene between Lawrence and his fellow 
soldier-cartographers in Cairo. Sliding his fingers up a match to put it out, 
Lawrence says: "Of course it hurts. The trick is not minding that it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
There's a slyness to the film makers' presentation of Lawrence; twice, they set 
off his superhuman accomplishments with scenes in which a detached observer 
catches him when he believes himself utterly alone. As he runs to float his 
silken sheik's robes, given by Sharif as a measure of homage, and to catch his 
reflection in his dagger, we move sideways to see his preening, mortifyingly, 
from the point of view of Anthony Quinn, as Auda Abu Tayi, sardonic leader of 
an opposing tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The film, now 3 hours and 36 minutes long (rated PG, because its language is 
pure although its scenes are sometimes bloody), is in two unequal halves. The 
action before the intermission is the upward arc of Lawrence's life, the second 
half is his tragic unraveling, documented by Arthur Kennedy's Jackson Bentley, 
a correspondent and resident ugly American. 
</P>
<P>
The first half ends after Lawrence has pulled off a seeming military 
impossibility, crossing the oven-like Nefud desert and capturing the Turkish 
stronghold of Aqaba. Lawrence's return is a moment of unabashed theater -- Gen. 
Allenby conferring with his filthy, burnoose-clad lieutenant, equal to equal. 
It's a little embarrassing to discover how deeply satisfying the scene is. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter second half, as Lawrence's illusions are stripped from him, is 
almost unendurably painful and oddly unsatisfying. Here, the great visual 
moments are invariably connected with suffering, like the scene in Allenby's 
quarters when Lawrence's wounds at the hands of the Turks bleed through his 
jacket. This stigmata is an eerie, almost Shakespearean device, a bloody 
witness to his "weakness." 
</P>
<P>
In the year after its debut, "Lawrence's" overwhelming authority collared seven 
Academy Awards -- best picture, director, (color) cinematography, (color) art 
direction, sound, editing and music. Although it seems shocking that O'Toole 
and Sharif were omitted, now we can also be grateful for its artful and 
resourceful restorers, Robert Harris and Jim Painten, to Columbia Pictures and 
the quartet of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Jon Davison and Dawn Steel, 
who supported the complex restoration.

After reviewing contracts between RKO and Orson Welles and his Mercury 
Productions company, Turner Entertainment Co. has dropped plans to colorize 
Welles' classic film, "Citizen Kane." "While a court test might uphold our 
legal right to colorize the film, provisions of the contract could be read to 
prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate," Roger Mayer, 
president of Turner Entertainment, said Tuesday. He added that Turner has 
restored a printing negative that will provide "first-rate black-and-white 
prints of this masterpiece" for TV viewing. ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow

KCBS-TV Channel 2 will launch a half-hour, 6 a.m. weekday newscast, beginning 
Feb. 27, General Manager Robert Hyland announced Tuesday. "Action News Early 
Report" will be anchored by Jim Moret (who handles the local news cut-ins to 
"CBS This Morning"), with veteran broadcaster Bill Keene providing traffic and 
weather updates. Also featured will be a daily wrap-up from Sports Director 
Keith Olbermann and other news segments. The announcement comes two weeks after 
rival KABC-TV Channel 7 announced plans to launch a half-hour early morning 
newscast (to be aired at either 6 or 6:30 a.m.) in coming months. KNBC-TV 
Channel 4 has a locally-produced newscast that airs at 6:30 a.m. ALEENE MacMINN

Film maker Steven Spielberg has donated $850,000 to the School of American 
Ballet in New York. The gift will be used to help build a special ballet studio 
now under construction at the school's new Lincoln Center facility, and will be 
the only one of five new studios to incorporate seating for student 
performances. The late George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirsten founded the school 
in 1934.ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow

Diana Ross has become a part-owner of Motown Records and has agreed to resume 
recording for the label she helped propel to popularity in the 1960s, the 
company announced. The size of her investment was not disclosed. Ross, who 
recorded on Motown with the Supremes in the 1960s but who left the label in 
1980 to sign with RCA records, has signed an exclusive contract with the new 
Motown, which was bought in June by a partnership of MCA Inc. and the 
investment firm Boston Ventures.ALEENE MacMINN and Shauna Snow

Theater impresario James A. Doolittle, general director of the Southern 
California Theatre Assn., has received a superior achievement award from the 
U.S. Information Agency for his part in presenting an acclaimed production of 
Herman Wouk's "Caine Mutiny Court-Martial" in Beijing last October. The play, 
which was directed by Charlton Heston, was produced and partially underwritten 
by Doolittle and Bette Bao Lord, wife of the U.S. ambassador to China, Winston 
Lord. "Caine" is the first in a series of American plays that Doolittle and 
Lord will produce in China with the Beijing People's Art Theatre. ALEENE

"Driving Miss Daisy," a prize-winning American play about an elderly white 
woman and her black chauffeur, has opened in Johannesburg to rave reviews from 
critics delighted by its low-key handling of racial friction. With the 
exception of one critic who found the script too bland, black and white 
reviewers from pro-government and opposition newspapers praised the play and 
the production, which opened last week at the Market Theater. For the past 
decade, the theater has been Johannesburg's main showplace for multiracial 
drama and has featured many militantly anti-apartheid works. ALEENE MacMINN and

JAZZ NOTES : NIEHAUS MOVES FROM 'BIRD' TO 'HOT MEN'; PIANIST DAVID BENOIT GETS 
STAMP OF APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lennie Niehaus, musical director for Clint Eastwood's "Bird," has been signed 
to supervise the sound track for "The Hot Men," a film about the "love-hate" 
relationship between clarinetist Benny Goodman and drummer Gene Krupa scheduled 
to begin shooting in May. 
</P>
<P>
The film -- to be produced by Philip A. Waxman ("The Gene Krupa Story," "Tell 
Them Willie Boy Is Here") and to be directed from his original script by Bob 
Boris ("Steele Justice," "Oxford Blues") -- will spotlight four Los Angeles 
musicians handpicked by Niehaus to recreate music played by Goodman's quartet 
in the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Abe Most, drummer Jack Sperling, vibist Charlie Shoemake and 
pianist Mike Lang will respectively play the musical roles of Goodman, Krupa, 
vibist Lionel Hampton and pianist Teddy Wilson, a unit that was noted both for 
its artistry and as the jazz world's first integrated foursome. 
</P>
<P>
All the music for "The Hot Men" will be newly recorded by Niehaus. 
</P>
<P>
CHASING A GRAMMY: Pianist-composer David Benoit, 35, sees his Grammy nomination 
for best jazz fusion performance for "Every Step of the Way" (GRP) as a solid 
stamp of approval. "Being from the South Bay and hanging in with local bands, 
working my way up, it's truly exciting to get this kind of recognition from the 
industry," the Redondo Beach resident said. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination came as a surprise, Benoit said. "Actually, when I did 'This 
Side Up' (Spindletop, 1985), I thought that one would get a nomination, but it 
didn't, and neither did 'Freedom at Midnight' (GRP, 1987), so I said 'To hell 
with it.' So I had no expectations, but when I found out, I was thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
Benoit is up against saxman Tom Scott ("Amaretto" from "Streamlines," GRP); 
bassist John Patitucci ("John Patitucci," GRP); the Yellowjackets ("Politics," 
MCA); and keyboardist Lyle Mays ("Street Dreams," Geffen). 
</P>
<P>
"If I were up against Miles Davis or George Benson, it would be tougher, but 
the way it is, it's pretty even," he said. "Lyle, the Yellowjackets, John, 
we're all contemporaries of each other. Tom Scott has more experience, so he 
may be favored, but the balance is nice." 
</P>
<P>
Benoit is currently at work on his new LP, "Urban Daydreams," "which includes 
some contemporary things in an orchestral setting that Don Grusin's producing," 
he said, "and I just did a straight-ahead date with Emily Remler and Luther 
Hughes, both for GRP." 
</P>
<P>
The pianist's next Los Angeles appearance will be at the Greek Theatre in June. 
</P>
<P>
RECORDED BEST BET: Trombonist Ray Anderson's "Blues Bred in the Bone" 
(Gramavision) is a mad mixture of blues, funk, swing and sentiment that teems 
with musical life. Anderson, possessing a gargantuan tone, is sassy and biting 
on the title track, alternately raucous and tender on "A Flower Is a Lovesome 
Thing," and simply a delight on the rhumba-ish "Mona Lisa." The strong cast, 
including guitarist John Scofield and pianist Anthony Davis, shines throughout.

'ELEPHANT' ON PBS: A GRIM STATUS REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic

<TEXT>
<P>
What a thrill to see the birth of an elephant. A membrane-wrapped package falls 
to the ground, and almost immediately the wobbly, 175-pound calf struggles to 
stand and reach its mother's milk, metaphorically becoming an entire species 
fighting for survival. 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies the conflict of "Elephant," the latest PBS special from the 
National Geographic Society, a celebration and a eulogy, a chronicle of birth 
and of slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
It airs at 8 tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24, and at 9 on Channel 50. 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Elephant" is unpleasant, for here, in this wise and eloquent hour 
written and produced by Irwin Rosten, is another chapter in the eternal 
conflict among earth's inhabitants. This one illogically pits humankind against 
the elephant, with the inevitable result looming ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Filming in Laos, Sri Lanka, Thailand, India, Kenya and Zimbabwe, Rosten 
dramatically contrasts the Asian and African elephants and the historic roles 
of each on their respective continents. 
</P>
<P>
The elephant traditionally has been respected in Asia. But these powerful, 
intelligent animals are also utilized as laborers and entertainers there, 
undergoing a brutal domestication in being bent to the will of humans whose 
economic livelihoods are dependent on them. And on another front, notes 
narrator E. G. Marshall, the Asian elephants are imperiled by "a tidal wave of 
people and their machines." 
</P>
<P>
The larger African elephant roamed the wilderness freely and was never 
domesticated, we're told. But now that wilderness, too, is shrinking, even as 
the demand for the elephant's ivory is growing. We're given the ultimate 
paradox, beauty produced by carnage: pictures of exquisite ivory sculptures 
followed by pictures of elephants slain by poachers for their tusks, their 
decaying carcasses being picked at by vultures. 
</P>
<P>
Weighed against this is that rare and wonderful birth sequence at a zoo in 
Portland, and also the monitoring of animal savers -- scientists and others 
studying and working to preserve the elephant. "It's probably only a holding 
action," one of them admits. 
</P>
<P>
The hour concentrates so heavily on this tenuous coexistence with humans that 
elephants in the wild -- free, unencumbered and doing what comes naturally 
without human involvement -- are largely absent from the program. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this shortcoming itself becomes a grim status report of the elephant, who 
fills the screen tonight with his greatness and sadness.

Voters in a special primary put Tuskegee Mayor Johnny Ford, who is seeking to 
become Alabama's first black congressman this century, into a runoff against 
Secretary of State Glen Browder. The winner of the Democratic runoff on March 7 
will face state Sen. John Rice of Opelika, who won the Republican nomination 
amid a light GOP turnout. The general election, on April 4, is to fill a 
vacancy created by the Dec. 13 death of Rep. Bill Nichols, a Democrat first 
elected in 1966. In unofficial final returns, Browder, a 46-year-old former 
Jacksonville State University professor, received 14,701 votes, or 25%, 
followed by Ford, also 46, with 14,434 votes, or 24%. Seven other candidates 
shared the remainder.

The traditional classroom, with its lecturing teachers and workbooks, is 
turning out students with basic skills but little more, a new report said. The 
National Assessment of Educational Progress called for major changes in how and 
what American students are taught, based on 20 years of evaluations funded by 
the Education Department. The group credited "relatively traditional" 
classrooms with gains at the lower levels of achievement. But it said teachers 
will have to become less authoritarian and students less passive if more 
sophisticated learning is to occur. The group has studied the math, science, 
reading and writing performance of 9-, 13- and 17-year-olds for 20 years under 
the auspices of the private Educational Testing Service.

The U.S. Army has ordered a college student, who set off a nationwide search 
when he ran off with his new wife to find "perfect love," to serve four years 
as an enlisted man to work off his ROTC scholarship. Scott Swanson, 24, of 
Naperville, Ill., will be permitted to finish college, delaying his induction 
into active duty until as late as May, 1990, officials said. He violated his 
ROTC contract when he and his wife, Carolyn, 23, disappeared last April 2. The 
Swansons were secretly married a week before they disappeared. Their ransacked 
car was found in a Chicago alley with the engine running, leading to fears of 
foul play. The couple turned up unharmed July 27 in San Diego.

The Polish government, in a statement by spokesman Jerzy Urban, expressed 
cautious optimism about talks with Solidarity, but it warned the banned 
independent union to "stop pressing us against the wall." "We want to reform 
the country, and if this requires the government's withdrawal from its hitherto 
policy, that's something else," Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said 
in response to Urban's statement. Meanwhile, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa 
traveled to Jastrzebie, in the coal-mining region of Silesia, to seek 
rank-and-file backing for the negotiations dealing with Solidarity's demand for 
legalization.

At least 24 people were killed on the eve of Sri Lanka's first general election 
in 12 years, and political leaders appealed jointly for peaceful voting. Police 
said 19 supporters of various political parties were gunned down in the south 
in attacks they blamed on the left-wing People's Liberation Front. In addition, 
25 buses were set on fire to protest the election. In the northern district of 
Jaffna, five Tamil separatist guerrillas opposed to the voting were killed in 
clashes with Indian troops, Indian sources said.

EPA STAFF BARRED FROM URANIUM PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its counterpart at the state level 
have barred their employees from visiting the federal government's uranium 
processing facility in southwest Ohio because of the risk of exposure to 
radioactivity, a spokeswoman confirmed. EPA Regional Administrator Valdas 
Adamkus, in a letter last week, said tests showed that agency personnel were 
exposed to uranium oxide when they went to the Feed Materials Production Center 
at Fernald and that no EPA personnel would go to the site "until this health 
risk can be satisfactorily addressed." The Ohio EPA followed suit, said 
spokesman Allan Franks. But the plant's operator said that routine urine tests 
to detect exposure ensure that the workers are protected. "We think the plant 
is safe," said William H. Kelley, spokesman for Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, 
the contractor running the plant for the Energy Department.

The Environmental Protection Agency will have 26 months to develop a plan under 
which Ventura County can achieve compliance with federal clean air standards, 
according to a proposed settlement between the EPA and an environmental group. 
Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, a coalition of Ventura County environmentalists, 
sued the agency last February to require enforcement of the federal Clean Air 
Act in the county, whose ozone levels are ranked by the EPA as the fourth-worst 
in the nation. The lawsuit was necessary because county officials had been 
unable to develop a plan that would comply with federal standards, the 
environmentalists said.

Rescuers were forced to crawl on their stomachs through brush up to 10 feet 
high to reach a remote spot where a plane slammed into a 3,000-foot mountain, 
killing three San Diego men, authorities said. Authorities planned to return to 
the crash site on Volcan Mountain in northeastern San Diego County to continue 
their investigation. The victims were identified as pilot and plane owner John 
Halstan Maloney, 34; Richard Marlin Rex, 42, and Tony Aguilar III, 27.

The United States and the Soviet Union have agreed to work more closely in an 
effort to curb illegal salmon fishing in international waters in the Pacific, 
the State Department said. Officials said in a statement that the two countries 
have decided that illegal salmon fishing on the high seas by other nations 
represents an "irrational and wasteful harvesting method and that all efforts 
should be taken to prevent the unauthorized possession, harvest, transport and 
sale of salmon in the North Pacific."

DEAL IS REJECTED BY NORTH JUDGE; 
</P>
<P>
GESELL TO AWAIT HIGH COURT'S VIEW ON SECRETS

<P>
A federal judge Tuesday rejected a compromise agreement on the screening of 
classified information for the trial of Oliver L. North that had been worked 
out by the Justice Department and independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, objecting to the joint request for 
stricter procedures as unworkable and too late, said that he will await word 
from the Supreme Court on whether the trial can go forward, an announcement 
that may come in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, meanwhile, said that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh could "terminate the 
case or any count" in the indictment at once if he submitted an affidavit 
barring disclosure of state secrets that North's lawyers say they need for his 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"He can act now if he wants," Gesell told Justice Department attorney Stephen 
A. Saltzburg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Last-Minute Objections 
</P>
<P>
Expressing his displeasure that the Justice Department had filed last-minute 
objections on behalf of U.S. intelligence experts last week, just as he was 
choosing a jury, Gesell declared: "I find no basis for giving him (Thornburgh) 
a seat at the counsel table or the right to intervene by way of bits and pieces 
of affidavits whenever the going gets tough." 
</P>
<P>
The judge, however, granted a concession to Justice Department officials in one 
area in which they had expressed grave concerns -- that the identities of 13 
countries that had provided aid to Nicaragua's rebels in return for U.S. 
assistance might be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that he would consider masking the names of the countries as 
long as the identities are not essential to a fair trial for the former White 
House aide. He said that he would hear more from attorneys on that issue today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would 'Gut Defense' 
</P>
<P>
North's attorneys had objected to the proposed compromise, contending that it 
would "gut the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Gesell concluded the 90-minute open-court hearing by declaring that Walsh was 
solely responsible for North's prosecution under the 1978 Ethics in Government 
Act. That act removes the Justice Department from investigating or trying 
current or former high government officials who might have political influence 
with the department. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lawyers are reviewing the judge's order," Thornburgh aide David Runkel 
told reporters, adding that Justice Department officials have been meeting with 
the independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of things being discussed back and forth," Runkel said. 
"It's a question of reviewing the options. . . . We want the trial to continue 
but we want to safeguard against the unauthorized release of classified 
information." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said that Thornburgh, who chiefly was responsible for making the 
eleventh-hour bid to increase restrictions on use of classified information in 
the Iran-Contra trial, had no right to urge the court to tighten its trial 
procedures. Gesell acknowledged, however, that Thornburgh -- under the 1980 
Classified Information Procedures Act -- has the power to withhold sensitive 
information if he determines that its disclosure would harm national security. 
</P>
<P>
In such instances, charges against North might have to be dropped -- as 
happened last month when the primary counts of conspiracy and theft were 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed Thornburgh-Walsh compromise would have required Gesell to allow 
government security experts to screen any evidence to be presented by North in 
nine specific areas. Gesell noted that he already has worked with Walsh and 
defense attorneys to screen hundreds of sensitive government documents over a 
six-month period during which Justice Department officials were silent on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist Order 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, in fact, had said that he was satisfied with the longstanding procedures 
for handling classified materials but had agreed to the compromise with 
Thornburgh to speed up the trial. Just before that agreement last weekend, 
Thornburgh had obtained an order from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that 
North's trial must be delayed pending a Supreme Court review of the dispute, 
set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh had planned to ask the high court to bow out if Gesell accepted the 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
But Gesell said that the compromise plan would force many delays in the trial, 
with jurors having to be excused from the courtroom. He said that the plan also 
might interfere with North's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said Tuesday that he wants to study the sensitive area of third-country 
support for the Contras, which U.S. officials had secretly lined up during a 
period in which direct U.S. military support for the Nicaraguan rebels was 
prohibited by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Essential 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers said in court papers Monday that former President Ronald Reagan 
and other top officials had sought to conceal the third-country support from 
Congress and the public and that it was essential for North's defense that 
jurors understand the matter. 
</P>
<P>
They suggested that North's use of arms-sale profits from a third country -- 
Iran -- might be more understandable to jurors in light of this broader policy. 
In return for aiding the Contras, part of a quid pro quo arrangement was that 
the United States would provide "CIA covert support" to those nations, North's 
lawyers said Tuesday in new court papers. 
</P>
<P>
The former National Security Council aide still faces 12 felony counts, 
including shredding documents and lying to Congress and then-Atty. Gen. Edwin 
Meese III in 1986 to hide his role in the sale of arms to Iran and the 
diversion of some of the proceeds to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said that "some cynics" might view Thornburgh's action as an attempt to 
protect the Reagan Administration, of which the attorney general and North had 
been a part. But, the judge said, he does not share that view.

S&amp;L BILL WOULD EXPAND POWERS OF REGULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Bush Administration sent Congress sweeping legislation Tuesday designed to 
resolve the savings and loan crisis by providing broad new powers to federal 
regulators. Some analysts said the move would sharply accelerate the extinction 
of S&amp;Ls as they exist today. 
</P>
<P>
As already outlined by Administration officials, the plan would transfer 
regulation of the thrift industry to banking regulators and place future 
S&amp;L bailouts under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which now handles 
only banks. 
</P>
<P>
But the legislation spells out more starkly than officials had disclosed 
previously the extent to which the Administration wants Congress to go in 
reshaping S&amp;Ls to make them more like banks and in encouraging banks to buy 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Reacts With Shock 
</P>
<P>
Reaction in the savings and loan industry was one of shock -- and, in some 
cases, anger -- setting the stage for a major battle between the White House 
and the industry and its longtime supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Barney R. Beeksma, chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, warned 
that the measure would "weaken even the healthiest institutions -- the ones who 
have so faithfully stuck to the business of providing mortgage credit for the 
home-buying public." 
</P>
<P>
Beeksma called the bill "a counterproductive approach that would make a bad 
situation worse." 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise development, the bill provides for a contingency plan to enable 
the government virtually to quadruple the premiums S&amp;Ls pay for deposit 
insurance. The sharp hike above the modest increases now proposed would come if 
cash flows prove inadequate to finance past as well as future bailouts. 
</P>
<P>
In another unexpected twist, the measure would allow federal authorities to 
renegotiate parts of the $40-billion worth of deals that the Federal Savings 
and Loan Insurance Corp. made with would-be buyers last year to get them to 
take over insolvent S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, regulators would not be able to cancel contracts already 
signed. But they could seek, by offering other incentives, to renegotiate with 
buyers to obtain better terms for the government. Congress has criticized many 
of the deals as too generous. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would order the Treasury to conduct a full-scale review of the 
current federal deposit insurance program, including whether the government 
guarantee covering up to $100,000 per account should be limited to one account 
per person and to individuals, not corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Also Study Guarantee 
</P>
<P>
A Treasury spokesman said that the study also "could" explore whether the 
$100,000 maximum should be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a provision that would have a major impact in California, the 
legislation would empower federal regulators to override state regulations that 
allow S&amp;Ls to invest in areas outside of housing -- such as shopping 
centers, restaurants and race horses. 
</P>
<P>
It would give the FDIC's governing board the power to order an S&amp;L to stop 
practices that the regulators believe are posing an "undue risk" to the federal 
insurance fund. California has been far more lax than other states in 
sanctioning unconventional behavior. 
</P>
<P>
A major thrust of the Administration's rescue effort would be to force savings 
and loan institutions to follow stricter financial procedures now required only 
of banks. S&amp;Ls traditionally have been allowed more latitude in their 
financial practices because they were designed to promote home purchases, 
considered a desirable social goal. 
</P>
<P>
A thrift association spokesman, who asked not to be named, branded the plan a 
"certain death knell for the industry." 
</P>
<P>
And Bert Ely, president of Ely &amp; Co., an Alexandria, Va., consulting firm, 
said that it is unlikely that even healthy S&amp;Ls could survive the proposed 
maximum fees. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction in Congress was more muted. House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs 
Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said that the Administration "is 
making a good-faith effort to develop a workable plan," but he questioned 
whether it is being fully candid about the potential cost of the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Authorize regulators to raise the premiums charged S&amp;Ls for federal 
deposit insurance to a maximum 75 cents per $100 in deposits, compared to the 
23 cents initially proposed. The current fee is 20.8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Require S&amp;Ls to meet all current standards imposed on banks, including 
doubling the amount of capital they must have to back up their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Extend the current moratorium against S&amp;Ls leaving the Federal Savings 
and Loan Insurance Corp. for another five years, to prevent a mass exodus of 
healthy S&amp;Ls seeking to avoid the higher rates. Many S&amp;Ls would prefer 
to shift their insurance to the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remove, after two years, most of the barriers that now prohibit bank 
holding companies and other potential investors from acquiring healthy S&amp;Ls 
as well as insolvent ones, without necessarily having to take both as a 
package.

HIGHER INTEREST RATES PREDICTED; 
</P>
<P>
FED ACTION MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO CURB INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Interest rates, already at their highest levels since 1984, appear headed still 
higher despite the Bush Administration's fond hope that the Federal Reserve can 
tame inflation relatively painlessly, a growing number of economists now 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Once an upward wage-price spiral has been triggered, the only way to reverse 
it is through recession," said David Levine, chief economist at Sanford C. 
Bernstein &amp; Co., a New York investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
While inflation remains comparatively modest, it is now so firmly entrenched in 
the economy, Levine contended, that a mere slowdown in economic growth will not 
be enough to bring it down. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve nudged interest rates up another notch this week in the 
wake of last Friday's report of an unexpectedly large 1% jump in January 
wholesale prices, officials said. The federal funds rate, a key short-term 
interest rate on inter-bank lending that is closely controlled by the Fed, held 
at 9.25% Tuesday, up from around 9% over the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, long-term bond yields crept up again Tuesday, with the 
30-year Treasury bond rising to 9.11% from a 9.06% yield late Monday. That left 
it significantly higher than the 8.91% yield when the government sold bonds to 
investors last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts, because they do not see a recession in sight this year, are 
convinced that the latest Fed move will not be the last. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed does not stop rising prices merely by announcing it is opposed to 
inflation," contended David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services 
in Chicago. "It has to discipline the system periodically by raising interest 
rates more rapidly than inflation expectations and, if necessary, threatening 
to punish it with recession if fine-tuning gestures prove inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
By raising interest rates, the Fed makes borrowing more expensive and forces 
consumers and businesses to cut back on their spending, ultimately easing the 
pressures that push prices up. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Nearly 10% Rate 
</P>
<P>
Hale said that he expects the federal funds rate to rise from 9.25% to nearly 
10% later this year. Levine is even more pessimistic, expecting both short-term 
and long-term interest rates to rise steadily for perhaps as much as two years 
before finally toppling the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Inasmuch as interest rates have risen only a small fraction of the distance 
necessary to trigger a recession," Levine wrote in a recent report, "we believe 
the cyclical increase in both short- and long-term interest rates has a long 
way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Because Bush's budget plan relies on lower interest rates to help bring down 
the cost of financing the national debt, the Fed's credit-tightening moves are 
expected to make it much more difficult for the White House and Congress to 
reach their $110-billion deficit target next year. 
</P>
<P>
That has the White House worried. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal 
published Tuesday, President Bush repeated earlier statements urging the Fed to 
avoid pushing interest rates sharply higher. Bush said that he "wouldn't like 
to see" any further credit-tightening by the Fed, adding that he is not "overly 
concerned about inflation" and considers the recent one-month jump in wholesale 
prices an "anomaly." 
</P>
<P>
Fed policy-makers are still taking a cautious approach to monetary policy, 
hoping to avoid further significant tightening because of worries over 
widespread problems among savings institutions and the sensitivity of budget 
negotiations this year. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts remain doubtful that they will be able to avoid a considerable 
increase. That raises big questions about whether the Administration's forecast 
on the economy -- which calls for a sharp decline in both interest rates and 
inflation -- can be achieved. The only alternative that would allow rates to 
come down would be a damaging downturn in the economy, analysts say, which 
would make the budget deficit worse by sharply slowing down the growth in 
federal revenues from higher incomes and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highly Fanciful' 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration's interest rate forecast appears highly fanciful," said 
Hale. "It is awfully hard to see how the Fed is going to achieve the soft 
landing it wants." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said 
that such a "soft landing" in which inflation and interest rates come down 
without a recession may be at least "theoretically possible -- but the Fed's 
tools are not sufficiently precise to make it likely to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The problem facing Washington policy-makers, he said, is that built-in 
inflation pressures, although modest by standards of the 1970s, are now working 
their way through the economy, forcing the Fed to push up interest rates and 
slow down real growth well before it will have any success in curbing rising 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists, however, hold starkly contrary views. "From early 1987 to the 
present, the money stock has grown at a rate close to 4% per year," argued John 
Rutledge in the latest forecast by his Claremont Economics Institute in 
Southern California. "This kind of money growth will not permit the existence 
of sustained inflation. . . . Push as they will, rising cost will have a hard 
time creating inflation in this environment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Downtrend 
</P>
<P>
And Alan Reynolds, chief economist at Polyconomics Inc., in Morristown, N.J., 
said that he believes "inflation should be trending down, not up, bringing 
interest rates down with it." He pointed to evidence of relative calm in 
commodity and gold markets. "Investors are not acting as though they expected 
higher inflation. There is no rush into tangible assets, such as gold and real 
estate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Fed officials, according to the recently disclosed minutes of their 
December policy meeting, agreed that even though "commodity prices appeared to 
have leveled off, they showed little sign of reversing earlier increases." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible 'Further Tightening' 
</P>
<P>
Worried that "greater inflation would become embedded in the economy" unless 
they acted to restrain credit again, Fed policy-makers decided to push interest 
rates up a notch at that time and agreed to "further tightening at the start of 
1989 unless incoming evidence on the behavior of prices, the performance of the 
economy, or conditions in financial markets differed greatly from current 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
And if anything, Jordan said, expectations have gotten worse since that 
meeting, not better.

'THE SATANIC VERSES'; 
</P>
<P>
WHY ISLAM IS OUTRAGED OVER NOVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART and TERRY PRISTIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been banned throughout the Muslim world, and at least six people have 
died in riots against it. Protesters in England have burned it. And on Tuesday, 
the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for Muslims worldwide to rise up and 
kill its author. 
</P>
<P>
The object of this outcry, "The Satanic Verses," is a fanciful, sprawling novel 
in a style critics liken to that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Thomas Pynchon. 
Its author, Salman Rushdie, describes the book as primarily a chronicle of the 
immigrant experience -- hardly the sort of work that could be expected to set 
off a worldwide furor. 
</P>
<P>
But Rushdie's novel has struck a deep chord among a wide spectrum of Muslims -- 
not just fundamentalists in theocratic countries but moderates and 
intellectuals in the West as well -- who see it as a thinly disguised, 
blasphemous assault on their religion. Among themselves, they appear to 
disagree mostly on how best to respond to it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mockery, Derision Cited 
</P>
<P>
That such a book would be written and receive widespread attention in the West, 
many Muslims say, is yet another instance of how they are mocked and derided by 
cultures that make no effort to understand or appreciate them. 
</P>
<P>
"Islam is seen as something that the Western media makes fun of and distorts," 
contended Yvonne Haddad, a professor of Islamic history at the University of 
Massachusetts at Amherst. "The author is Islamic, but Muslims are holding the 
West responsible for not censuring (the book)." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, even before protests against the book erupted in violence in Pakistan 
earlier this week and in Khomeini's death threat Tuesday, the book's publisher, 
Viking Penguin, had received a series of bomb threats at its New York 
headquarters, and a number of U.S. Muslim groups had mounted a letter-writing 
campaign against it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tour Being Reviewed 
</P>
<P>
So intense was the reaction that Viking is reviewing Rushdie's scheduled 
11-city book tour, which has been due to bring him to Los Angeles on March 8 
for a reading at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
A Viking spokesman, asking that his name not be published, said Tuesday that no 
decision has been made on whether to go ahead with the tour. But Viking issued 
a statement deploring the violence and death and disavowing any intention to 
offend. "We very much regret the distress the book has caused," the publisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitivities among Muslims to their portrayal in the West have been heightened 
during the past two decades, beginning with depictions of greedy Arabs during 
the OPEC oil embargo of the 1970s and continuing through the fundamentalist 
revolution in Iran a decade ago and continuing strife in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even against that backdrop, say Muslims in the United States, Rushdie's 
novel stands out as insulting, and the common denominator of their ire is its 
characterization of the prophet Mohammed and other figures of early Islam. Many 
say the book reveals its true agenda by using the pejorative medieval Christian 
name, Mahound, first used during the Crusades, for Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
In that respect, the protest over "The Satanic Verses" is reminiscent of last 
year's furor over the movie, "The Last Temptation of Christ," which was 
assailed by conservative Christians for its portrayal of Jesus Christ as a 
vulnerable human being. 
</P>
<P>
To a greater degree, "The Satanic Verses" depicts Mohammed as momentarily weak 
-- a characterization that is especially offensive to a faith in which visual 
images of Mohammed are not permitted and, for the most part, truths revealed by 
the Koran are not to be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an attack on the miracle of the Koran itself," said one Southern 
California Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Thought Police' 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the attacks in a statement in the current issue of The New York 
Review of Books, Rushdie contends he is the victim of "contemporary Thought 
Police." 
</P>
<P>
"One may not discuss Mohammed as if he were human, with human virtues and 
weaknesses. One may not discuss the growth of Islam as a historical phenomenon, 
as an ideology born out of its time," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the taboos against which 'The Satanic Verses' has transgressed. . . 
. It is for this breach of taboo that the novel is being anathematized, 
fulminated against and set alight." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over "The Satanic Verses" apparently has not hampered the 
book's popularity in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been selling like hot cakes," said Julie Protze, cashier at a B. Dalton 
outlet in Hollywood. "Everybody is buying it -- housewives, students, people 
who like to read. I sold one last night to a guy who looked like a guitar 
player from a rock 'n' roll band." 
</P>
<P>
The novel, which took Rushdie -- an India-born British citizen -- five years to 
write, begins as a jumbo jet explodes over England after a terrorist attack, 
and two passengers miraculously survive. One is a major Indian movie star, the 
other a radio celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Plummeting to Earth, they find their identities gradually altering. The movie 
star is sprouting a halo, while the radio actor is growing horns and a tail. 
</P>
<P>
Moving back and forth between Bombay and London, the book tells their stories 
by interweaving fables, folk-tales, magic and social commentary. 
</P>
<P>
Though Rushdie is much admired for such previous books as "Midnight's 
Children," published in 1981, critics were not universally kind to "The Satanic 
Verses." Writing in The Times, Richard Eder found "altogether too much plot in 
the book" and concluded that "too many characters are drawn spectacularly but 
hastily." 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post's Jonathan Yardley called it "an odd, uninvolving book that 
shows only intermittent flashes of its author's considerable gifts." 
</P>
<P>
The title refers to an incident in the life of Mohammed reported by two Arab 
historians of the 9th and 10th centuries but later discredited by commentators 
on the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Incident 
</P>
<P>
According to the story, Mohammed, meeting with resistance from the merchants of 
Mecca to his new monotheistic faith, makes a pact to accept three local deities 
as angels, or "daughters of Allah." But then he withdraws this concession, 
saying Satan had put words in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie revives this story, which Muslims view as blasphemous, by having 
Mohammed appear as "Mahound" to one of the novel's characters in a dream 
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Other passages in the book are also "very obscene," according to Muzammil 
Siddiqi, director of the Islamic Society of Orange County. Under what Siddiqi 
called "a thin veil of fiction," Rushdie describes the patriarch Abraham (a 
patriarch in Islam as well as Judaism and Christianity) as a "bastard" and 
labels the wives of the prophets "whores." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The African Bilal 
</P>
<P>
One of the followers of Mohammed, the African Bilal, and a figure much admired 
by black American Muslims, is called an "enormous black monster." 
</P>
<P>
The book is not available in the Muslim world. In the United States, there are 
as many as 3 million to 4 million believers. In interviews Tuesday, American 
Islamic leaders uniformly characterized Rushdie's novel as "insulting," but 
disagreed widely over what the appropriate response should be. 
</P>
<P>
Some key U.S. Muslim leaders are urging restraint, saying that Islam is capable 
of withstanding vicious attacks. Others say they simply would like to see the 
book ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Some denounce the reaction of Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, to "The Satanic 
Verses." Others point out, however, that Islamic law can be interpreted as 
calling for severe punishment -- even death -- for anyone who defames the 
Prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sort of perception by Muslims that if this book was anti-Semitic, 
it would have been censured in this country but because it is anti-Muslim, it 
is being distributed freely," said Haddad, organizer of a major conference on 
Muslims in America last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County center joined many American Muslims -- as many as 100,000, 
Siddiqi claimed -- in writing letters of protest to Viking late last year. "It 
is not right to keep silent," regardless of the publicity generated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ammar Abdulhamid, manager of the Islamic Center of South Bay-L.A. in Lomita, 
also took part in the letter-writing campaign. Publication of the book is "a 
new step taken by the Western media to attack our religion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A more passive response was recommended by Dr. Maher Hathout, a physician who 
is spokesman for the Los Angeles Islamic Center, who said he has almost 
finished reading Rushdie's book. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel very threatened by the fact that someone is attacking Islam," 
Hathout said. "Islam has and does tolerate vicious attacks. Our Arabic 
literature is full of opinions -- those of some philosophers, for instance -- 
that some consider blasphemous but they were never confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
"So I don't think the (Rushdie) book deserves that big fuss. It only helps in 
advertising a book which is not really worthy of that widespread attention," 
Hathout said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, M. T. Mehdi, president of the New York-based National Council on 
Islamic Affairs, said the book "should be ignored -- to ban it or commit 
violent acts is counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie is not the first writer to have a work banned in a Muslim country. For 
example, "Children of Gebalawi," a novel by Naguib Mahfouz of Egypt, the 1988 
Nobel laureate in literature, is considered sacrilegious for its allegorical 
treatment of the history of monotheism. The Egyptian publishing house that has 
exclusive rights to his works omits mention of this 1959 novel in its 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
As for Khomeini's threat, some Islamic leaders were reluctant to comment 
directly. But Abdulhamid, despite his strong feelings about the book, remarked: 
"To say that he (Rushdie) should be killed is ridiculous. That is stretching 
the matter too far." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, booksellers in the Los Angeles area reported no complaints for 
carrying the book. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't received any political or negative reactions to the book," said 
Nola Butler, co-owner of Butler/Gabriel Books in Westwood, where the book was 
sold out Tuesday. "Maybe that's to come," she said. "I don't plan to stop 
selling it." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the recent riots in Pakistan, "The Satanic Verses" had been selling 
consistently well, according to Viking's publicity department and local 
booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
But now, said Ed Conklin, manager of Dutton Books in Brentwood, "There is a 
frenzy to get the book. We ordered 40, I think there is one copy left." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Pierson of Book Soup in West Hollywood said he sold his last copy at 2 
p.m. and planned to order more. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue sales of the book, and if there are any threats, we 
are still going to continue selling it," Pierson said. "I suspect we are just 
seeing the beginning of interest in the book."

SAN DIEGO, ORANGE COUNTIES OK TAX BREAK ON HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the state's most populous counties, San Diego and Orange, agreed Tuesday 
to give large, voter-approved property tax breaks to homeowners over 55 years 
of age who sell their property and move elsewhere in California. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles County officials, faced with a bleak budget picture, remained 
divided over whether to implement the special allowance that won overwhelming 
voter approval as Proposition 90 last November. 
</P>
<P>
Strongly supported by retirees and Realtor organizations, Proposition 90 passed 
with more than 69% of the statewide vote. The measure enables homeowners over 
55 to transfer the assessed value of a home they are selling to a new home in 
another county, thus permitting them to pay property taxes at lower rate. A 
homeowner meeting the age requirement could, for example, transfer his old low 
rate set under Proposition 13 to a new residence, unlike other buyers who pay 
higher taxes based on purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
However, the allowance applies only if the county where the new property is 
located approves the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4 Counties Participate 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, supervisors in Orange and San Diego counties voted such approval 
and joined Kern and San Mateo as the only counties in the state, so far, to 
participate in the Proposition 90 plan. The tax break has encountered stiff 
resistance from some counties opposed to the program because it reduces the 
amount of possible property tax revenues generated by home sales. 
</P>
<P>
Five counties -- Monterey, Sacramento, Santa Cruz, Sonoma and Tulare -- have 
already rejected the plan, and others have indicated that they intend to let 
the program die by simply ignoring it. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of counties have said they don't plan to implement it," said Cary 
Jung, a legislative analyst for the County Supervisors Assn. of California, 
which has been surveying the 58 counties. 
</P>
<P>
The resistance to Proposition 90 is troubling news for older homeowners who had 
planned to sell their homes in one county and buy a retirement place in another 
at no increase in property taxes. (On transactions within the same county, 
persons 55 and over automatically get the tax break because of another 
initiative, Proposition 60, passed in 1986.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all alone in the world, and I want to buy a smaller home," said a 
73-year-old Hollywood Hills woman. "But I can't do it unless I can keep my 
Proposition 13 savings." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 90, which was backed by the American Assn. of Retired Persons and 
the California Board of Realtors, was designed to allow older homeowners to 
maintain their property tax savings, said Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long 
Beach). Elder, a supporter of the measure, added that it also could benefit 
younger home buyers by increasing the stock of older homes that owners leave 
behind when they move. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Proposition 90 program, a homeowner qualifying for the tax break 
must: 
</P>
<P>
* Be over 55 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
* Buy or build a replacement home within two years of selling the previous 
dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
* Buy a home of equal or lesser value than the sale price of the dwelling being 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, a homeowner with a $100,000 house in Orange County who 
bought a $200,000 house in Los Angeles County would be able to transfer that 
$100,000 assessed value to his new home -- provided that Los Angeles is a 
participant in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the county is the loss of property tax revenue, which would 
amount to about $1,250 a year in taxes for each $100,000 difference in assessed 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials are still estimating the volume of revenue that might be 
lost in Los Angeles County, Assessor John J. Lynch said he still favors 
implementing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We should carry out the mandate of what the people voted for," said Lynch who 
estimated that the revenue losses would be only in the "hundreds of thousands 
of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
But Treasurer-Tax Collector Sandra Davis, citing the possibility of even a 
minimal revenue loss, said she would recommend that the board oppose the plan. 
Auditor-Controller Mark Bloodgood has made a similar recommendation to county 
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, the Board of Supervisors is expected to set a public hearing date in 
the next few weeks to discuss Proposition 90, and Supervisor Deane Dana said 
any final decision will be influenced by the county's precarious financial 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I am alarmed at the county's financial situation, and if we face any 
substantial loss in revenues, we may have to defer implementing this until next 
year," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald D. Hedden, chairman of the California Legislative Committee for the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons, said his group is hoping that counties act 
quickly in deciding whether to implement a program. He added that, meanwhile, 
that some homeowners may think Proposition 90 is already in place. 
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that many of our constituents assume just because Proposition 
90 passed, it would become law and be applicable throughout the state," Hedden 
said, "but that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, where supervisors voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to join the 
program, Assessor Greg Smith said he expected the financial benefits to the 
county from older homeowners selling their homes will offset the impact of any 
new property owners who arrive in San Diego with their old property tax rates.

PUBLIC'S ENTHUSIASM OVER PROP. 103 PASSAGE HAS RISEN, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed by the California Poll say that passing 
Proposition 103 was a good thing, showing much more enthusiasm for the measure 
than was evident in November when voters passed it by a narrow 51% majority. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the public is highly skeptical that it will ever see the 20% 
rate rollbacks called for under the measure. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results, published Tuesday, come at a time when lawyers for the 
insurance industry have been arguing to the state Supreme Court that the 
electorate only voted for Proposition 103 because of its rollback provisions 
and contending that if those are invalidated by the high court, then the rest 
of the initiative ought to be invalidated as well. 
</P>
<P>
But the California Poll found that a substantial majority of those surveyed 
liked the initiative, even though they do not expect the 20% rollbacks from 
1987 levels will be allowed to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Beside the rate rollbacks, Proposition 103 contains provisions allowing banks 
to sell insurance and agents to rebate part of their commissions, limits 
companies' rights to cancel policies and mandates rate regulation by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,007 people surveyed by pollster Mervin Field between Jan. 23 and 31, 
62% said they thought the passage of Proposition 103 was a good thing; 20%, a 
bad thing; 3%, both good and bad, and 15%, no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
However, only 29% of those questioned said they thought their rates would fall 
under Proposition 103, while 38% expected no change and 23% believed their 
rates would actually go up. Ten percent had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Also, 36% of those surveyed thought it would be more difficult to obtain 
insurance coverage, 11% thought it would be less difficult, 42% believed there 
would be no change and 11% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also asked those surveyed who they might be inclined to elect as state 
insurance commissioner, if the Supreme Court upholds the Proposition 103 
provision that makes the job an elective post beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exploratory Effort 
</P>
<P>
Among Democrats reportedly interested in running for the job, Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden of Santa Monica fared the best, with 50% saying they would be inclined 
to vote for him. Hayden recently launched an exploratory effort to see whether 
he might successfully run for the post. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, only 26% of those surveyed said they would be inclined to vote for 
Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn, 21% for state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van 
Nuys), 18% for state Sen. Daniel Boatwright (D-Concord) and 8% for State Board 
of Equalization member Conway Collis, all mentioned as potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of respondents said they had no opinion about most of those listed 
as potential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about possible Republican candidates, 22% of those surveyed said they 
would be inclined to vote for the present insurance commissioner, Roxani 
Gillespie, although 33% said they would not be inclined to vote for her. The 
rest said they did not know. Gillespie, however, has already said she would not 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Republicans mentioned, 16% said they would be inclined to vote for 
state Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin; 14% for Sen. Marian Bergeson, Newport 
Beach; 13% for Assemblyman Larry Stirling, San Diego, and 11% for Sen. Becky 
Morgan, Los Altos Hills.

CLEAN WATER COST PUT AT $83.5 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
EPA SAYS TWO-THIRDS OF TREATMENT PLANTS HAVE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Highlighting the enormity of an unmet need, the Environmental Protection Agency 
Tuesday revised its estimated cost of upgrading the nation's sewage treatment 
facilities to meet federal standards for water quality and public health to 
$83.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The new figure is a 4% real increase over a previous assessment in 1987, 
suggesting that the nation has failed to gain ground in combatting water 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of the nation's 15,600 waste-water treatment plants now 
have "documented water quality or public health problems," the agency said in a 
report to Congress assessing the nation's compliance with standards set under 
the 1972 Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Urged 
</P>
<P>
After noting that the cost of improvements would consume all of the EPA's 
current $4.9-billion annual budget for the next 17 years, new EPA Administrator 
William K. Reilly declared: "We must think cooperatively about how we are going 
to solve waste-water treatment problems." 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of municipal water treatment agencies charged that the new 
Administration has not cooperated with them so far, noting that its 
$1.2-billion budget request for water cleanup funds is only half that 
authorized by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"What it means is that there isn't going to be enough money," said Eric 
Sapirstein, a lobbyist for the California Assn. of Sanitation Agencies. "If 
you're low on the priority list and there isn't enough money to go around, you 
ain't going to get funded." 
</P>
<P>
Sewage treatment modernization costs in California were estimated at $5.3 
billion, third highest in the nation behind New York and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has committed itself to a $3-billion modernization 
program, but Los Angeles County sanitation districts are still seeking a waiver 
that would free them from costly renovation to meet federal sewage treatment 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shifted the Burden 
</P>
<P>
State officials' concerns reflect a new anxiety in the wake of passage two 
years ago of the Water Quality Act, which shifted the burden for construction 
of waste-water treatment facilities from the federal government to state and 
local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
That legislation, passed with the support of the current critics, set out a 
plan calling for federal construction grants to be phased out at the end of 
this year and to be replaced by contributions to a State Revolving Loan Funds 
program. 
</P>
<P>
But, because the Reagan and now the Bush Administration requested less 
financing than Congress envisioned, state officials and environmentalists are 
warning that the nation's quest for clean water could be left severely 
underfinanced. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be some serious water quality problems coming down the 
road," said Linda Eichmiller, deputy director of the Assn. of State and 
Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators. "That's the risk here. 
That's what's at stake." 
</P>
<P>
EPA Administrator Reilly, noting that the 4% increase in the estimated cost of 
cleaning up waste water is small in comparison to previous fluctuations in 
estimates, said in a statement: "The good news from the survey is that our need 
for new or improved waste-water treatement facilities appears to be leveling 
off, and we now know the scope of the need." 
</P>
<P>
But Reilly pointed out that the survey "found significant unmet needs, with a 
large price tag." 
</P>
<P>
Revised modernization plans for some waste treatment plants and recently 
identified needs for other facilities account for the bulk of the increase, the 
agency reported. It said that the greatest needs are concentrated in highly 
populated states such as California, New York, Florida and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists Scoff 
</P>
<P>
However, a number of environmentalists scoffed at Reilly's contention that an 
increase in estimated clean water costs could be viewed as "good news." They 
argued that the revised figure calls attention to the inadequacy of the 
Administration's current budget request and to the magnitude of the task 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone may have assumed we were well on the way to clean water," said Eric 
Draper, director of the Clean Water Action Project. "This should cause 
everybody to sit up and take notice and say: 'What is going on here?' "

More than 180,000 bureaucrats of the Russian Republic, the largest of the 
Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics, have been shifted to other jobs in the 
past six months, the official Tass news agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tass did not say where the 180,000 are now employed. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions are part of a move to decentralize the Soviet economy, where 
bureaucrats have long determined everything from prices to the number of nails 
sold in Moscow stores. 
</P>
<P>
Initial results of the plan were discussed at a meeting of the Presidium of the 
republic's Council of Ministers on Monday.

Catalans, always proud of the things that make them different from other 
Spaniards, disapprove of bullfighting, according to an opinion poll. 
</P>
<P>
The survey in the northeastern region published Tuesday showed 53% of Catalans 
questioned thought the sport should be banned, 12% thought it was cruel but 
should not be stopped and 23% thought it would be acceptable if it did not end 
with the death of the bull. 
</P>
<P>
Only 8% thought bullfighting was a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was carried out for the Catalan regional government, which last year 
became the first in Spain to introduce a law to protect animals against 
cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
The law does not prevent bullfights at permanent rings.

KHOMEINI SAYS AUTHOR OF 'SATANIC VERSES' SHOULD BE KILLED

As anger over an allegedly blasphemous novel continued to gather force in the 
Islamic world, Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said 
Tuesday that the author and publishers of the book should be killed. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio said Khomeini issued a statement saying in part: "I inform the 
proud Muslim people of the world that the author of 'The Satanic Verses,' a 
book which is against Islam, the prophet and the Koran, and all those involved 
in its publication who were aware of its content, are hereby sentenced to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Author Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen, told the British 
Broadcasting Corp. that he takes Khomeini's threat "very seriously indeed." Not 
long afterward, he was reported to be in hiding and under police protection 
somewhere outside London. 
</P>
<P>
The London offices of his publishers, the Penguin Group, were also under police 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outraged Responses 
</P>
<P>
What Khomeini called a "sentence of death" was the latest in a series of 
outraged responses to the "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
Although few in the Muslim world say they have read the prize-winning 
allegorical novel about Britain's treatment of its colonial subjects, the book 
has provoked widespread outrage. In Britain, where the book was first 
published, there have been public book burnings in areas that have large Muslim 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
The book has been banned in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South 
Africa. In the United States and Britain, Islamic militants have called for it 
to be withdrawn from the market and for Rushdie to publicly ask "forgiveness 
from Almighty Allah for the great insult which he has brought up." 
</P>
<P>
Publication of the book in the United States sparked two days of rioting in 
Muslim areas of India and Pakistan. Over the weekend, demonstrators stoned the 
U.S. Cultural Center in Islamabad and five people were killed when riot police 
fired at the demonstrators. An Indian was killed Monday at a demonstration in 
Srinagar, India, where protests continued Tuesday. Khomeini was quoted as 
saying Tuesday that "The Satanic Verses" was written and published "in 
opposition to Islam." 
</P>
<P>
"I call on all zealous Muslims to execute them quickly, wherever they find 
them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic sanctity," Tehran Radio quoted 
him as saying. "Whoever is killed doing this will be regarded as a martyr and 
will go directly to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government declared today a day of national mourning to protest 
against the decision to publish "poisonous and insulting subject matter 
concerning Islam, the Koran and the blessed prophet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tour Being Reconsidered 
</P>
<P>
Followers of Islam believe that the Prophet Mohammed is God's messenger on 
Earth and that the Koran, Islam's holy book, consists of revelations from the 
Almighty as given to Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
In London, a spokesman for Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken, said a planned book 
promotion tour of the United States, scheduled to begin later this week, is now 
under review. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe expressed his "very real concern," and 
the British government was generally adopting a cautious stance on the threat 
to Rushdie, for fear of jeopardizing the safety of a British citizen imprisoned 
in Tehran as an alleged spy. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian Information Minister Mohammed Mohammedi-Reyshahri was quoted by the 
official news agency IRNA as saying that a court has completed its proceedings 
against British businessman Roger Cooper, held since December, 1985, and had 
imposed a "heavy sentence" on him. The minister added, without elaborating, 
that final judgment is still under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and Iran resumed diplomatic relations last November, and the British 
authorities had hoped that Cooper might be released as part of an amnesty 
announced to mark last week's 10th anniversary of the Islamic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Despite expressing concern about the danger to his life, Rushdie, in his 
interview with the BBC, was not in a mood to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, at a personal level it's very worrying," the 41-year-old, 
Bombay-born author said in a brief film clip shown on the BBC and Independent 
Television News here Tuesday night. "But I think, beyond that, it shows this is 
a later stage in a campaign which began with smears and vilifications and 
distortions of the book which has escalated to all sorts of levels of violence. 
And, frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book. 
</P>
<P>
"A religion that is able to behave like this -- religious leaders, let's say, 
who are able to behave like this -- and then say that this is a religion that 
must be above any kind of whisper of criticism; I mean, that doesn't add up. It 
seems to me that Islamic fundamentalists could do with a little criticism right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed Tuesday evening, Penguin's Viking unit, whose 
trademark appears on the British and U.S. editions of Rushdie's novel, 
commented: "Neither we nor the author of this novel published the book with 
intent to offend. We very much regret the distress the book has caused." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tragic Loss of Life' 
</P>
<P>
Referring to six people killed in anti-Rushdie demonstrations, the Viking 
statement said, "We are appalled at the tragic loss of life that has already 
occurred and deplore calls to future violence." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Penguin Group confirmed that it has stepped up its security 
precautions after the Khomeini threat. The spokesman refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The threat to Rushdie is being taken seriously. Britain has about a million 
Muslims among its 55 million people, and they have been an increasingly 
militant minority. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Moujahedeen of Iran, a dissident exile group, called Khomeini's 
action "absurd" and "hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, who was born in Bombay but came to Britain as a 14-year-old schoolboy, 
has described himself as a lapsed Muslim but insists that his book is not 
intended to be anti-religious. A British reviewer termed it "a sort of 'Last 
Temptation of Mohammed,' " in the spirit of the controversial Greek novel and 
American film, "The Last Temptation of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie said in an interview last Sunday with the Guardian newspaper that he 
was "very upset" by the deaths that resulted from demonstrations against his 
book in Pakistan. However, he said: "The deaths are not on my conscience. I am 
a writer trying to deal with real issues. I have not arranged any marches on 
embassies or arranged for shots to be fired. . . . I am completely horrified. 
The idea that people should directly or indirectly be dead as a result of (the 
book) is hard to believe."

DEMOCRATS ASK BUSH AGAIN FOR BUDGET DETAILS 
</P>

Democratic congressional leaders renewed their demands Tuesday for more details 
on President Bush's proposals for major domestic programs and said that they 
cannot start preparing a new federal budget without them. 
</P>
<P>
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who came to 
Capitol Hill for the second day in a row to reassure the distressed lawmakers, 
said that the missing figures would be provided, perhaps by the end of this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu joined the budget talks Tuesday, 
asserting that the President wants the negotiations on spending levels for the 
fiscal year starting Oct. 1 to succeed and pledging his cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obligated to Give Figures 
</P>
<P>
Two powerful Senate chairmen, however, made public a letter that they sent to 
Bush reminding him that he has an obligation to provide detailed figures and 
warning him that they would use former President Ronald Reagan's budget 
requests as his own unless Bush's proposed changes are received "in the near 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and 
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), head of the Budget Committee, joined in the pointed 
request to underscore their unhappiness over Bush's decision to avoid setting 
specific spending levels for $136-billion worth of federal programs other than 
defense, Social Security and interest on the public debt. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the House Budget Committee, Chairman Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) 
said that there appears to be "confusion" in the Bush Administration over 
whether the President favors keeping these programs at current spending levels 
or whether he wants to go along with Reagan's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't negotiate when most of the lines are blank," the California lawmaker 
complained. "The big question mark is non-defense discretionary," he said, 
referring to federal spending that is not automatically required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Darman said that his staff would submit the necessary numbers by Thursday in 
consultation with staff aides from the Senate and House budget panels. The 
first congressional budget hearings begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still some ambiguities that need to be cleared up and I hope they 
will be," Sasser said. "There is more fluidity than I would prefer on the $136 
billion. . . . Perhaps that can be cleared up." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Appropriations committees in both chambers can begin their work, 
Sasser said, they need a detailed breakdown of how much the President wants to 
spend for dozens of programs for which he failed to provide specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, Darman declared, the Bush Administration is further along in the 
budget process than its predecessors in recent years. "We're providing data on 
everything," he declared. "Really, it's an extraordinary effort." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats in Congress, however, have expressed the view that Bush's decision to 
lump most domestic programs in a so-called "black box" and freeze their overall 
outlays at the current total of $136 billion was designed to make them share 
the blame for making unpopular cuts in the existing level of services.

WHITE HOUSE PRESSING SENATORS TO PUBLICLY BACK TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House, concerned that opposition by Senate Armed Services Committee 
Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) could derail John Tower's nomination as secretary of 
defense, is privately pressing senators to endorse Tower publicly without 
waiting for a final FBI report on his background. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, obviously nettled that the lobbying is taking place before the final 
report is filed, declared Tuesday that he will wait and examine the document 
before deciding how to vote on the nomination in committee. 
</P>
<P>
And he said he expects most senators of both parties to await the committee's 
recommendation before making a commitment on how they will vote when the 
nomination comes before the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, according to informed sources, ordered the lobbying effort 
after Nunn told him at a private meeting on Feb. 7 that he had "serious 
concerns" about certain allegations involving Tower. Nunn told Bush that, if a 
committee vote were taken at that time, as some had urged, he "would vote no 
because of those concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, as well as other senators on the committee, were known to have expressed 
concern about allegations involving excessive drinking and an accusation by a 
suspect in the Pentagon procurement fraud investigation that illegal 
contributions had been channeled to Tower's campaign when Tower was a senator. 
</P>
<P>
With the FBI continuing to investigate those allegations, the committee agreed 
last Wednesday to delay any action on the nomination until after the Senate 
returns next Tuesday from a recess. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is now being concluded and a report should be completed in a 
few days. A source familiar with the inquiry said that no "smoking gun" had 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater, White House press secretary, said Tuesday that Frederick D. 
McClure, Bush's assistant for legislative affairs, is leading the White House 
lobbying effort for Tower's nomination and that several senators had agreed to 
"speak out" for Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, interviewed at a luncheon session with editors and reporters of The 
Times' Washington Bureau, at first said that several Democratic senators were 
among those who would speak out but refused to name any. Later, after checking 
with McClure, Fitzwater said that there are no commitments from Democrats and 
that the lobbying is confined to Republican senators. 
</P>
<P>
However, sources familiar with the lobbying told The Times that the effort is 
aimed at lining up Democratic senators also. And one Democratic member of the 
committee, who asked not to be identified, said that he has been contacted but 
told the White House that he plans to support Nunn in whatever position he 
takes. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that there is nothing "inappropriate" about the White House lobbying. 
But he said it is strange that the Administration would be pressing senators to 
speak out before the final FBI report has been filed, especially because White 
House counsel C. Boyden Gray has told him that it "would not be proper" for the 
committee to make a decision before seeing the report. 
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), said: "I find it 
incredible, extraordinary, that they're asking us not to take a position until 
we have the report but they are urging others to take a position." 
</P>
<P>
Wirth said that Nunn is the key to Tower's fate. If the chairman votes against 
him, the Democratic-controlled Senate probably will reject the nomination. "It 
all depends on Sam," Wirth said. "Everybody has such respect for Sam, and he's 
very cautious." 
</P>
<P>
Another committee member, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), is "very, very troubled" 
by inconsistencies in Tower's statements about his consulting work for British 
Aerospace Inc., an aide to Levin said. The aide said it is likely that Levin 
will ask that Tower be recalled to testify about the discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
Tower told the committee two weeks ago that he represented the British aircraft 
and weapons maker only on civil aviation matters, such as the sale of 
commercial jets. But, in a divorce deposition taken in June, 1987, Tower stated 
that he had given the company advice on "selling certain systems to the Defense 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
Tower sat on the board of directors of the U.S. subsidiary of the British firm 
and was paid more than $260,000 during the 2 1/2 years that he was associated 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
A Tower attorney said that the divorce deposition was a casual accounting of 
what he did for British Aerospace and a number of other defense contractors and 
was not meant to be a definitive statement of his consulting business. He said 
that the more recent statement to the committee is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
However, when Tower registered as a legislative lobbyist in February, 1988, he 
explicitly listed British Aerospace as a "defense contractor" and not as merely 
a manufacturer of commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers John M. Broder and Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington contributed to 
this story.

ART QUEST: NOT A PRETTY SIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
MUSEUM'S FOUNDER EXHIBITS SCARS OF 5-YEAR BATTLE IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not as though Abby Sher wasn't warned when she decided to create a 
contemporary art museum out of a Santa Monica building once used for candling 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her when she started she was asking for trouble, getting involved in 
the art world," said Frank Gehry, the architect Sher hired to transform a group 
of dilapidated structures on Main Street into an updated piazza complete with a 
museum. "I told her she was walking into a cannon." 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Sher, who had no previous experience either in development or 
museums and no art collection of her own, has indeed become a woman besieged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces Charges 
</P>
<P>
Instead of winning praise from the city of Santa Monica for her philanthropy, 
she is facing misdemeanor criminal charges for alleged building and fire code 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being praised for enhancing the Ocean Park neighborhood, she is 
being closely watched by hostile homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of earning the gratitude of the burgeoning coastal art community, she 
has incurred the animosity of several of its more prominent members. Some 
artists suspect her of using the museum as a phony lure to obtain permits for 
building her Edgemar complex of stores and offices. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm boycotting that joint," said painter Billy Al Bengston. "I don't think of 
it as a museum. It's a shopping mall." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the story of the Santa Monica Museum of Art is a neighborhood 
dispute, in a city so sensitive to community concerns that City Council members 
were even willing to venture into residents' bedrooms in order to personally 
conduct noise tests. 
</P>
<P>
But in another sense, it is a cautionary tale for neophytes who might entertain 
hopes of infiltrating the prickly and quarrelsome realm of art, where ego and 
diplomacy can count just as much as taste and good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have problems with people who are not art professionals operating as if they 
are," said one respected museum director who did not want to be named. "Abby 
seems like a very nice person . . . but it just doesn't work because she's not 
coming from within the field." 
</P>
<P>
Unbowed by the assaults, Sher, 44, acknowledges she had "very little 
understanding of the workings of museums" but bristles at challenges to her 
integrity. "There were a million ways to make this project lucrative," she 
said, "and this is probably not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
A former clinical linguist at UCLA, Sher also attributes her problems to the 
anti-development sentiment in Santa Monica and the cynicism of the times. 
"People are just not used to someone who's not doing something primarily out of 
self-interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an imposing $7.3-million galvanized steel and mesh complex stands on 
the site of the former dairy plant, but three-quarters of the commercial space 
is empty and the museum has yet to officially open. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Sher's travails, the museum managed to stage a series of pre-opening 
exhibitions last summer, which exacerbated her problems with the city but drew 
favorable reviews from art critics. 
</P>
<P>
A number of heavyweights in the Los Angeles art world say the museum will be a 
valuable addition to the cultural life of the museum-poor Westside, where a 
lively gallery scene has been migrating over the last few years, especially in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Staunch backers of the new museum include Frederick M. Nicholas, chairman of 
the Museum of Contemporary Art, art collector Marcia Weisman, a MOCA board 
member, and painter Sam Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever doesn't like it should have his head examined," Weisman said, adding 
that "the ego of an artist is second to none." 
</P>
<P>
Sher said she did not even know what a mortgage was until she bought the 
property, a block from her home, with money inherited from her father, a 
shopping center developer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Look 
</P>
<P>
As the plans evolved, she decided that the 10,000-square-foot museum would be a 
kunsthalle, an exhibition space of the type more common in Europe. It will 
offer temporary shows by visual and performance artists but have no permanent 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
It was Sher's buy-back plan that fueled the controversy over her intentions. 
She is donating the museum rent-free to a nonprofit corporation for five years 
following its official opening, now tentatively scheduled for June. Eventually, 
she expects the organization to buy it back at half its market value, currently 
estimated at $2 million. Otherwise, it will revert to commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
"If the community feels (the museum is) of value, I believe it's up to them to 
share with me in the burden," she declared. 
</P>
<P>
Some of her critics believe that deadline is unrealistically tight, that donors 
will be loath to give money to an enterprise that could wind up as a hardware 
store. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . Just when they started to get on their feet and get a reputation as a 
museum, they'd have to turn around and start looking for another space," said 
artist Laddie John Dill. 
</P>
<P>
In her dealings with the art community, Sher probably made several strategic 
errors, according to both critics and supporters, beginning with her failure to 
immediately establish an official board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
She alienated some of the artists by firing her first museum director, Hal 
Glicksman, former director of the Otis-Parsons Institute's art galleries. 
Glicksman wanted the museum to build a permanent collection of the work of 
local artists, as well as a historical record of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately after Thomas W. Rhoads was installed as director last year, 
he found himself buttonholed by groups eager to make use of the fledgling 
institution. The museum's response, however justified, did little to engender 
good will. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the Venice Art Walk, an annual benefit for the Venice Family 
Clinic, thought the new museum would be an ideal spot for the post-walk 
fund-raising dinner. Rhoads, a former official with the New York State Council 
on the Arts, turned them down, explaining, "We thought our first benefit should 
be for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Another group wanted the museum to stage the Artists Against AIDS exhibit, 
which was shown instead in West Hollywood. Rhoads said the museum was not yet 
equipped to display valuable works by artists such as David Hockney and Sam 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
"That annoyed a lot of people," said Christopher Ford, co-owner of the Pence 
Gallery on Colorado Avenue in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the Santa Monica and Venice Art Dealers Assn. tangled with Rhoads 
after asking the museum to put on a show of works from its 20 member galleries. 
Rhoads agreed, provided that each gallery become a corporate member for $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
"The membership thought it would look like they had bought the show," said Lee 
Musgrave, the organization's former president, explaining why the deal fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Sher believes that the museum will eventually improve its relationship with the 
galleries, and she dismisses the conflict with the artists as "pettiness." 
</P>
<P>
Rhoads said he is confident the museum will be able to operate on an annual 
budget of $350,000, with nearly half that expected to come from the board of 
directors when it expands to 30 members. As for whether the museum will be able 
to buy the building, he said, "One million dollars is not a lot of money in 
this town." 
</P>
<P>
Whether some of the neighbors will ever accept the project is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
So angry are these neighbors that when a museum employee disposed of the 
remains of an ice sculpture, someone reported it to the city as toxic waste 
dumping, Sher said. 
</P>
<P>
As she sees it, a handful of residents were dead set against the project from 
the outset, and were lying in wait for her as she wound her way through the 
thicket of boards and reviews required by Santa Monica and the Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
She needed permission to use the rear half of the parcel, zoned for residential 
use, as a restaurant site. She also needed to demonstrate that the project 
would have adequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
A neighborhood group "found it in their interest to cast me as a villain," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As the homeowners see it, however, they supported her once she abandoned plans 
to put a third story of residential units on top of the complex, which would 
have blocked their ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a negative comment about the museum per se," said Steve 
Spencer, whose home faces the back of the project. "We're pro art." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they made numerous concessions because of the museum. "That 
was a very exciting concept to the Planning Commission," said Suzanne Frick, a 
principal planner for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Frick and Spencer say their relationship with Sher began to sour when her 
construction crews violated local noise regulations. 
</P>
<P>
A critical moment came last year when Sher asked the city to modify the 
restaurant operating hours that both sides had agreed on in order to 
accommodate a prospective tenant. Spencer and his allies felt betrayed. The 
restaurant she had in mind was much more upscale and likely to be far more 
disruptive than the one they had pictured, the critics said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like she was taking the whole theme of the project in a different 
direction," Spencer said. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors were not merely upset, said Councilman Herb Katz, "they were like 
alligators in heat." 
</P>
<P>
After noise tests were conducted in neighboring homes with the help of Katz and 
other council members, Sher was allowed to lengthen the restaurant hours. But 
the restaurateurs, feeling unwelcome, backed out. 
</P>
<P>
The coup de grace, city officials said, was Sher's decision to hold the 
pre-opening museum events last year before she had a certificate of occupancy. 
For that, she got slapped with the misdemeanor citations. 
</P>
<P>
Sher's attorney, Charles R. English, said the criminal case the city filed 
against his client last month is based on a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe at least we had de facto compliance," he said, adding that the city 
is quibbling over minor issues, such as the height of the tampon dispenser in 
the women's restroom. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials say Sher has ignored repeated attempts to communicate with 
her. A court appearance is set for today.

MIXED RECORD RAISES DOUBT OVER PRIVATIZED LOW-INCOME HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to housing poor people, one city's vision of progress can be 
another's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
As officials in Los Angeles promote a plan to put Jordan Downs, one of the 
city's more rundown public housing projects, into private hands, officials in 
Boston are trying to figure out how to repair damage done to a low-income 
housing project in the many years it has been in the hands of private owners 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Without adequate heat or hot water, the site of a recent fire that injured two 
children, Geneva Avenue Apartments was described recently by a Boston Housing 
Court judge as "a warehouse for wretched human souls" and has been portrayed by 
Boston newspapers as one of the city's worst examples of slum housing. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,000 miles apart, the two projects illustrate the promise and perils of 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free Enterprise 
</P>
<P>
An idea that came of age during the Reagan era, privatization assumes that free 
enterprise can do a better job than government bureaucracy, even when it comes 
to providing decent shelter at bargain basement prices. About half of the 
nation's 4 million subsidized apartments are in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
At Jordan Downs, Los Angeles officials argue that, given the right incentives, 
a real estate developer can make the 700 apartments safer and sounder than the 
city's Housing Authority has been able to do in its 34 years of ownership. 
Officials concede that marketing a public housing project in a gang-infested 
neighborhood in Watts won't be easy, but they say they can do it. 
</P>
<P>
The privatization of low-income housing is not always a panacea, however, as 
life at Boston's Geneva Avenue Apartments and some other privately run projects 
illustrate. For over a year, Geneva Avenue tenants have been trying to persuade 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to take the complex away 
from its owner, a Southern California real estate investor, because of living 
conditions at the 60-unit building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boston Difficulties 
</P>
<P>
The owner, Allan Bird, has acknowledged that the project is in bad shape, but 
he said he is making improvements. He said living conditions deteriorated 
during a 2 1/2-year period in which he was trying to sell the apartments to 
another investor. Bird contended that terms of the sale placed responsibility 
for upkeep in the hands of the buyer, but that HUD ultimately declined to 
approve the sale and now is holding him responsible for conditions. 
</P>
<P>
With HUD insuring its mortgage, Geneva Avenue was supposed to offer investors 
enough incentives, including tax credits, to make it worth their while to run a 
comfortable apartment complex for poor people. The same basic package of 
incentives has been used to lure private investors into the low-income housing 
market around the country. The results have been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
"The record of management of low-income projects by private owners goes from 
fantastic to mediocre to terrible," said Sara Johnson, an expert with the 
National Housing Trust in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
One recent study revealed that about 43% of HUD-insured privately owned 
low-income housing is in danger of mortgage default. "As a general rule, a 
default is a sign of financial failure that carries over to poor upkeep and 
maintenance," said Larry Yates, an official of the National Low Income Housing 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
When low-income housing passes into private hands, the responsibility for 
making sure that landlords provide decent living conditions usually falls to 
HUD, a chronically understaffed agency, where the best of intentions cannot 
always get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreclosure Attempt 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, HUD's staff in Boston made an attempt to foreclose on the Geneva 
Avenue Apartments. Instead of complying with the foreclosure request, HUD 
officials in Washington arranged for the owner of the apartments to get a 
$1-million rehabilitation loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Geneva Avenue situation is not atypical of HUD's relationship with 
privately owned projects that have fallen on hard times, said an official of a 
national organization that lobbies for low-income housing. "HUD doesn't want to 
wind up owning these projects. The financial burden would be enormous if HUD 
took over all the distressed low-income housing currently in private hands. As 
a result, the agency tends to go easy on the owners," said the official, who 
asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
When investors do take care of low-income property, they are often motivated by 
the prospect of one day opening up their apartments to higher-income tenants. 
For the owners of subsidized housing, that day comes when the five to 20-year 
life span of HUD rent subsidies runs out. 
</P>
<P>
The country's critical shortage of low-income housing could well get worse with 
so many of these subsidies due to expire soon. According to Yates, 37% of 
HUD-insured housing units are likely to move onto the open market and out of 
reach of low-income tenants in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task for Congress 
</P>
<P>
The prospect raises a difficult problem for backers of privatization: How to 
prevent private investors from taking housing off the low-income market without 
destroying much of the financial appeal of the investments. Congress is 
currently grappling with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major problem, and, frankly, I don't know what we're going to do about 
it," said Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate's housing and 
urban affairs subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
For low-income tenants who are lucky enough to be in stable, well-maintained 
privately owned apartment complexes, life can be comfortable and secure, in 
part because of rules that tend to be stricter than tenants of many public 
housing projects are accustomed to. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have careful tenant selection. You have to have the right to 
reject tenants who have criminal records or bad credit records. And you have to 
make tenants accountable for their apartments. You can't let a family of five 
squeeze into a two-bedroom unit," said a Los Angeles real estate developer who 
has built and operated several low-income projects. 
</P>
<P>
But strict management by private owners sometimes means that tenants are 
treated "arbitrarily and unfairly" and denied the hearings and procedures of 
due process that public housing projects must provide, argues Jim Grow, a 
lawyer for the National Housing Law Project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the plan for Jordan Downs would have a developer pay $10 
million to $20 million to purchase the project and spend an additional $14 
million to fix it up and boost security. The developer would hope to recoup the 
investment through tax credits and rent subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a former Los Angeles congresswoman who has been hired 
by the Housing Authority to help arrange the Jordan Downs sale, said the 
developer will be held strictly accountable for running the project and will 
not be allowed to charge market-rate rents anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The developer will have to sign a covenant making him responsible for the 
property. He won't be able to syndicate it (dividing ownership among a number 
of investors) or hide behind a management company," Burke said. Moreover, she 
said the deed would require that Jordan Downs "remain available to low-income 
tenants for a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how long, Burke replied, "That's something we're going to have to 
discuss." 
</P>
<P>
Considering the price and the proposed conditions, Burke admitted that Jordan 
Downs may prove to be a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to require quite a big commitment. I frankly don't know if there's 
going to be a tremendous amount of interest in the project. We'll have to see."

FBI INVESTIGATES ALLEGED BRUTALITY IN RAID BY LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY and DAVID FREED, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI has launched a formal investigation to determine whether six Los 
Angeles police officers criminally violated the civil rights of an East Los 
Angeles family during a search of the family's home, a Justice Department 
spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials referred the case Feb. 1 to the FBI's Los Angeles field 
office, said Deborah Burstion-Wade, the spokeswoman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an open matter, which means we are looking at the case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators are trying to determine whether the officers committed 
any violations under "color of law . . . better known as police brutality" in 
the case of Jessie Larez and his family, Burstion-Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decision Will Be Made 
</P>
<P>
The FBI's findings will be forwarded to the criminal section of the Justice 
Department's Civil Rights Division, where a decision will be made whether to 
forward the matter to a grand jury for possible indictments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Such violations, although rarely proven in court, are punishable by fines of as 
much as $5,000 and prison terms of one year or longer. 
</P>
<P>
A Police Department spokesman said Tuesday that the department welcomed the 
FBI's probe and expressed confidence that the officers will be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers were there with proper reason," Cmdr. William Booth said. "They 
had a search warrant, they were investigating a murder and they were attacked 
by that family." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation stems from a raid in June, 1986, at the Larez home by members 
of the Police Department's anti-gang unit, Community Resources Against Street 
Hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
The raid occurred after CRASH officers said they had been tipped that one of 
Larez's sons, Edward, was harboring a murder weapon. No gun was found, but 
during the search, which was preceded at 7:01 a.m. with officers breaking 
windows of the house as a diversion, Jessie Larez's nose was broken, his 
daughter, Diane, was yanked to the floor by her hair and numerous household 
items were smashed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dismissed Complaint 
</P>
<P>
The family formally complained to the Police Department that excessive force 
had been used, but the officers' supervisors concluded that the operation was 
conducted within department policy and dismissed the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1988, after the Larezes had sued the Police Department, a federal 
court jury in Los Angeles awarded the family $90,503 in punitive and actual 
damages against the officers. Two months later, the same jury held Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates accountable for the officers' actions and ordered the chief to 
personally pay more than $170,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have appealed the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Larezes' attorney, Stephen Yagman, expressed confidence Tuesday that the 
Justice Department would seek to prosecute the officers. Said Yagman: "The 
Justice Department is going to do for Daryl Gates what I never could for him: 
make him a defendant in a criminal case." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for City Atty. James K. Hahn dismissed as premature any 
discussion of whether his office would defend the officers in a criminal case 
were one brought by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Until we receive benefit of either a suit or a detailed analysis of 
wrongdoing, backing up a criminal investigation," Ted Goldstein said, "it would 
be hypothetical at this point as to whether we could or would defend them."

2 COUNCIL PANELS ENDORSE AUTO ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED VOLLMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A controversial homing device system that Los Angeles police hope will help 
curb an ever-growing car theft epidemic was endorsed Tuesday by two important 
City Council committees. 
</P>
<P>
Backing for the system came over strong objections by several auto alarm 
dealers that the action would give the manufacturer, LoJack Corp. of Braintree, 
Mass., a city monopoly based on an ineffective system. 
</P>
<P>
Citing similar concerns last August, LoJack competitors successfully lobbied 
against state legislation that would have established a pilot program in Los 
Angeles County for the company's homing device. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assurance of No Monopoly 
</P>
<P>
Members of the council's finance and police committees were assured by the city 
attorney's office, however, that LoJack would not have a lock on the auto theft 
system market. A competitor developing a better system eventually would be able 
to tie into the LoJack network, the panels were told. 
</P>
<P>
A supporter of the LoJack system, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, described it as a 
"James Bond" type of crime-fighting weapon that should be tried in a city where 
last year 63,000 cars were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
The system uses a small homing device installed in a secret location in a 
vehicle. A specially coded number for the homing device is fed into a central 
computer along with a description of the car. 
</P>
<P>
If a car equipped with the device is reported stolen, police can send out a 
radio signal to activate the transponder in the car. Patrol cars equipped with 
a tracking device can then zero in on the stolen car and recover it. 
</P>
<P>
Under LoJack's proposal, which still faces full City Council review, the 
company would donate $1.5 million worth of tracking devices and other equipment 
to the LAPD for a three-year pilot program. Trackers would be installed in 
about 200 LAPD patrol cars and a number of police helicopters, and LoJack would 
then begin selling the homing devices for about $600 each. 
</P>
<P>
The tracking/homing system has been operating in Massachusetts for more than 
two years and is now installed in about 17,000 of the state's 5 million 
registered cars, said LoJack President C. Michael Daley. Florida has been 
experimenting with the system in three counties since Dec. 1, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Daley said that 334 of the LoJack-equipped cars had been stolen in 
Massachusetts since the program began and that 97% of them were recovered as a 
result of the tracking system. Furthermore, he said, nearly one-fourth of the 
unsuspecting auto thieves involved were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
But during a three-hour hearing of the two committees, LoJack competitors 
argued that the Massachusetts company's product was ineffective because most 
car thefts are not discovered until hours after they occur. This time lapse 
gives thieves plenty of time to either strip the car or drive it outside the 
range of the tracking system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Systems Could Be Used 
</P>
<P>
The competitors also argued that by agreeing to the LoJack pilot program and 
equipping the LAPD cars with the tracking devices, the city was in effect 
establishing a special relationship with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly critical of the LoJack proposal was Ze'ev Drori, president of 
Clifford Electronics in Chatsworth. Drori said that with a special scanning 
device, an auto thief can determine if police are tracking a stolen car and 
abandon it before being caught. 
</P>
<P>
Drori added that police already report an 85% recovery rate for stolen cars. 
The LoJack system, he argued, would not appreciably increase that percentage. 
LoJack President Daley countered that his company's system cuts the time 
between a theft and the recovery of a stolen car to an average of 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Drori's criticism brought a strong retort from Yaroslavsky, who noted that 
Drori's company had been one of the principal foes of recent state legislation 
to set up a pilot project in Los Angeles County to test the LoJack system. 
Clifford Electronics and a number of other firms had spent about $30,000 on 
campaign contributions and a lobbyist in their fight against the bill sponsored 
by state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). Davis eventually withdrew the bill after 
he contended that it had been gutted by the Assembly.

 HILL STREET SECTION REOPENED TO TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stretch of Hill Street in downtown Los Angeles that was closed two weeks ago 
to shore up a Metro Rail tunnel was reopened Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The segment was shut down Jan. 27 after construction engineers found unexpected 
stress on the struts that support a 1,000-foot section of Hill above the tunnel 
between Temple and 1st streets, said Greg Davy, a spokesman for the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Several horizontal steel struts have been added to the 80-foot-deep tunnel in 
the past two weeks, Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
The block near the Civic Center carries 2,400 vehicles during a normal morning 
rush hour. City traffic engineers rerouted traffic on downtown streets, and 
there has been congestion on and off since the closure. Six RTD bus lines were 
rerouted, Davy said. 
</P>
<P>
The refitting of the struts had little impact on the time schedule for the 
subway project, which is scheduled for completion in 1993, Davy said.

THE LESSON ON SKID ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than two dozen Crenshaw High School students traveled Tuesday to Skid Row, 
where four formerly homeless men of the Los Angeles Mission's rehabilitation 
program told them how drugs, alcohol and lack of education had shattered their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
After being urged by the men to remain in school, stay in touch with their 
families and avoid drugs and alcohol, the 25 members of a health class were 
taken on a tour of the mission by director Mark Holsinger. 
</P>
<P>
Then the students served lunch to about 500 homeless men and women. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the mission at 443 S. Los Angeles St. said it was the first 
time a group of high school students had been brought in for a close-up look at 
the consequences of dropping out, drugs and drinking.

OFT-DELAYED JUPITER SPACECRAFT PROJECT TAKES TINY STEP ON EVENTUAL TRIP OF 2.4 
BILLION MILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One key scientist has died and several others have retired while waiting for 
the often-delayed Galileo spacecraft to blast off for Jupiter, but success 
moved a little closer Tuesday when a probe that will dash through the Jovian 
atmosphere was packaged for a trip across town. 
</P>
<P>
It was a small step perhaps. But for the men and women who have grown gray and 
weary while waiting for their mission to get off the ground, any progress is to 
be cherished. 
</P>
<P>
Built by the Space and Communications Group of Hughes Aircraft Co., the small 
probe is to be trucked today from El Segundo to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
near Pasadena. The probe will be carried to Jupiter aboard JPL's Galileo 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between Oct. 12 and Nov. 21, Galileo is scheduled to be carried to low 
Earth orbit by the space shuttle. Originally, the craft was to use powerful 
liquid fueled rockets to blast itself from Earth orbit to Jupiter, but 
heightened safety concerns over cargo carried aboard the shuttle compelled the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to switch to less powerful -- but 
safer -- solid rockets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tortured Route 
</P>
<P>
That means Galileo will have to follow a tortured route, flying first to Venus 
and using the gravity of Venus to pick up speed and fling it back toward Earth. 
Then it will fly past Earth twice, using the Earth's gravity to boost its speed 
more, finally sending it on toward the distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will be more than 2.4 billion miles, and the craft will not reach 
Jupiter until December of 1995. But for a lot of scientists who have feared 
many times over the last few years that the entire project was going to be 
scrapped, 1995 is better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Technical and scheduling problems had already delayed the project a couple of 
years even before the space shuttle Challenger exploded, delaying it even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
The wisdom of proceeding with the mission has been questioned by NASA 
executives "at least once every year," said Joel Sperans, chief of the space 
exploration project for NASA's Ames Research Center. "We've had a lot of 
challenges, but they are behind us. I'm confident we will make it now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hasn't Been Easy 
</P>
<P>
But for many who have devoted considerable portions of their careers to the 
project, it has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of wear and tear on the bodies as well as the hardware," 
said Benny Chin, program manager for Ames. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Boese, principal investigator for one of the probe's six instruments, 
died in December of 1986. Other scientists have retired, and many others just 
drifted away to other agencies after growing weary over the seemingly endless 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very long program," said John Radecki, program manager at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
During the lengthy delays, the mission has been "reprogrammed" six times. But 
if successful, the $1.36-billion mission will give scientists their first look 
at an asteroid, and it will tell much about the giant, gaseous planet known as 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Main Parts 
</P>
<P>
Galileo consists primarily of two parts: Ames Research Center's atmospheric 
probe, which will plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at 107,000 miles an hour, 
and JPL's mother ship, which will orbit the planet for about 20 months, sending 
back data for that entire period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scientifically rich mission," said Richard Spehalski of JPL, who is the 
overall project manager. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before Galileo reaches the planet, the 4-foot-diameter 
atmospheric probe will separate from the main spacecraft. As the probe rips 
through the planet's atmosphere at that speed, it will slow down so quickly 
that "deceleration" forces will be equal to 350 times that of the gravitational 
pull of Earth. That will have the effect of making the 745-pound probe weigh as 
much as a DC-10 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
For 75 minutes, the probe will plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere. Sometime after 
passing through the first layers of clouds, the probe will be crushed by the 
dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
But before that happens, it will have sent back enormous amounts of data, 
scientists hope. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Make 10 Orbits 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "mother ship" will continue to study the planet and its four 
moons, making 10 orbits of the giant planet and sending back about 50,000 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, at least one other significant hurdle to overcome. Like all 
deep space probes, Galileo will use radioisotopes to generate the electricity 
it will need to run its instruments. And since it requires White House approval 
to launch any spacecraft with radioactive materials aboard, the mission must 
now undergo intensive review by several federal agencies before the President's 
approval for launch can even be requested. 
</P>
<P>
Spehalski, the project director, said he expects that approval to be granted in 
September -- the month before the scheduled launch.

SCOTT OSTLER: THE CRIME-TIME PLAYERS TURN SPORTS INTO DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My 4-year-old son isn't into spectator sports, unless they involve monster 
trucks flying through the air and crushing rows of helpless cars. So he hasn't 
formed any strong team allegiances or developed any sports-hero-worshipping 
tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
The day is coming, though, when he'll be peppering me with those cute 
questions, such as: 
</P>
<P>
"Why do horses snort cocaine, Daddy?" 
</P>
<P>
He'll want to know the meaning of sports terms such as "steroids," "rape," 
"mail fraud" and "parole." 
</P>
<P>
He is missing a hell of a year so far. We're not even two months into 1989 and 
the old sports/police blotter is SRO with reverse role models. 
</P>
<P>
It's so hard to keep up with it all, so as a public service, or as a one-day 
late Valentine's present, I hereby offer a 1989 Sports Crime Digest and Top Ten 
List. My research staff had the day off, so I apologize if I missed any 
deserving alleged felons or misdemeanorites. 
</P>
<P>
In reverse order of heinousness of allegations: 
</P>
<P>
10. Slam dunk of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The staff of the Seattle SuperSonics gets Dale Ellis a starting berth in the 
All-Star game by mass ballot-box stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
Kids, can you say "electoral process?" 
</P>
<P>
Another lesson here for the kiddies is that it's OK to do anything, because -- 
repeat after me -- "Everybody else is doing it." 
</P>
<P>
9. Tale o' the Tape. 
</P>
<P>
A University of Missouri assistant coach is fingered for an alleged recruiting 
violation when a recruit's mother produces a tape recording of the coach 
offering to buy the recruit an airline ticket. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't exactly original sin, but it's a unique new way to get busted. Times 
are tough for cheating recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
8. Kissing Bandit. 
</P>
<P>
It's no crime for Morganna to lumber across a court or field and kiss a 
ballplayer, but gee, can't we make it a crime? Misdemeanor bad taste? 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to trivialize this crime list by including a publicity-crazed 
woman, but will someone please check to see if there is a mandatory retirement 
age for these kind of people? Maybe I should shut up and be thankful she hasn't 
hired on to pose for the annual Sports Illustrated sex-o-rama issue. 
</P>
<P>
7. Stanley Wilson goes AWOL. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals' running back had a choice: Play in the Super Bowl or 
get Super High. 
</P>
<P>
Tough choice. Stanley took the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the Bengals weren't as diligent as they should've been in 
watching over this obviously troubled young man? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, it's like they say: Winning isn't everything, but losing is. 
</P>
<P>
6. An entry: Tony Dorsett and Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's not fair to lump these guys together, but who said this column was 
fair? And why lump them apart? 
</P>
<P>
Dorsett got 90 days in jail, sentence suspended, along with a fine and public 
service, for driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco was tagged by a cop for driving his new Jaguar in excess of 120 m.p.h. 
Must have been racing a PSA commuter jet, or Ben Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
5. Up the river, without paddle. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Kirk, former Memphis State basketball coach, is sentenced to one year in 
jail and $20,000 fine for income tax evasion and obstruction of justice (trying 
to intimidate a grand jury witness). 
</P>
<P>
Dana blames it all on his wife and her well-meaning, but badly bungled, 
bookkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, she's probably a great cook. 
</P>
<P>
The good news: Dana won't have to file a 1040 Form for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
4. Whom Do You Trust? 
</P>
<P>
In an upcoming book, Jim Valvano, North Carolina State basketball coach, is 
accused of gross abuse of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules, general 
ethics and power. Valvano pleads innocent, and is until proven otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Well, friends, somebody is lying -- the coach or the author -- and when we find 
out who, somebody is going to be in doop dee-dee, or deep doo-doo. 
</P>
<P>
3. Supersnorts. 
</P>
<P>
Post-race testing turns up traces of cocaine in horses trained by Wayne Lukas 
and Laz Barrera, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Since most of these thoroughbreds don't hang out on the streets, you have to 
assume someone slipped a little surprise into the old feedbag. This gives new 
meaning to common phrases such as "That ain't hay," "Winning by a nose" and 
"Get off your high horse." 
</P>
<P>
And it goes to show what can happen if you run with a fast crowd. 
</P>
<P>
2. Whooooooah, Okla-homa! 
</P>
<P>
Some people say the Oklahoma football program is basically honest, but I say 
it's not fair to label an entire program based on the actions of a few good 
apples. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Sooner players have been accused of shooting guns at one 
another, of rape, of selling cocaine to an undercover agent, of assault and of 
vandalism. At least 15 players have allegedly been involved in these lowjinks. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard of the Crimson Tide. Meet the Red-and-White Crime Wave. 
</P>
<P>
The good news: Not a single Oklahoma player has been accused of espionage 
against the government, or of breaking curfew. 
</P>
<P>
The man I feel sorry for is the Oklahoma stadium public address announcer next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ball carried by No. 42; tackle by No. 4739692387324." 
</P>
<P>
1. Pumping iron, and more. 
</P>
<P>
A former assistant coach of the Canadian Olympic weightlifting team admits to 
giving his "clean" urine to lifters. The weightlifters then allegedly injected 
the clean urine into their own bladders, by means of a catheter, in an attempt 
to beat a pre-Olympics drug test, because they had been doing steroids. They 
failed the test anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
This item tops (or bottoms) my crime list, because I score heavily for 
originality. 
</P>
<P>
I've heard of cramming for a test, but this is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
The year is young. As I write this, I hear news of a big-league baseball 
pitcher busted in a prostitution sweep, and a former college football player 
who gets six years in the slammer on cocaine charges. It's coming off the 
sports wire faster than I can shovel it. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, the final Top Ten will be dishonored at a lavish awards 
banquet held at Jovan, the suburban Michigan tavern where Leon Spinks tends bar 
and Denny McLain plays the organ. 
</P>
<P>
I hope my son watches cartoons until he's 50.

HEARING CONCLUDES FOR STEIN; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE TO RULE ON TRAINER'S APPEAL WITHIN 30 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Horse Racing Board hearing of Santa Anita trainer Roger Stein 
ended after 12 hours Tuesday nightwith an administrative law judge deciding 
that she will make her recommendation within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
The board, which is expected to take action at its regular meeting March 29, 
can either accept or reject the decision of judge Amanda Behe, who presided 
over the hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's hearing was the second in the appeal of Stein, who was suspended for 
six months and fined $2,000 by Santa Anita stewards shorty after his horse, 
Emperor's Turn, tested positive for cocaine after finishing second in a race at 
Santa Anita last October. 
</P>
<P>
Stein is one of six Southern California trainers whose horses have tested 
positive for cocaine recently. The others include Laz Barrera and Wayne Lukas, 
two of racing's biggest names. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's attorneys, who attempted to prove that cocaine was introduced into 
Emperor's Turn system shortly after he ran, also accused the state testing 
laboratory of operating in bad faith. The attorneys charged that the entire 
post-race blood sample from the horse was used before they could send part of 
the specimen to another laboratory for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's attorneys also introduced Jay Williams, a forensic toxicologist, who 
said that his examination of the horse's urine sample indicated that the animal 
was given the cocaine between 5 and 10 minutes before the sample was taken, or 
about 45 minutes after the race. 
</P>
<P>
The state, however, contends that Stein would still be guilty because of 
racing's absolute-insurer rule, which states that the trainer has the ultimate 
responsibility for the horse's condition. 
</P>
<P>
One of Stein's attorneys, Ken Lewis, said that despite an informal agreement 
with Len Foote, the executive secretary of the racing board, part of the 
horse's blood sample was not saved for analysis by an independent laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"If they wanted samples, they should have made the request," Foote said. 
"Normally we have enough blood for that request." 
</P>
<P>
Truesdail Laboratories, the Tustin facility contracted to perform testing for 
the racing board, was shown to be in error again. Last month, it was reported 
that Truesdail, through a computer foul-up, lost much of the data pertaining to 
a blood test. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Foote testified that Truesdail lost about 4% of 16,000 frozen urine 
samples because a shelf broke and the bottles shattered. The positives against 
four of the trainers, including Lukas and Barrera, have resulted from the 
testing of frozen samples. 
</P>
<P>
Foote also said that as the result of suggestions from UC Davis, whose 
veterinary school monitors racing board activities, a state investigator has 
been overseeing Truesdail activities this year. The investigator has found that 
labels on jars of urine samples have been loose and steps have been made to use 
more secure labels, Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
Foote also testified that the samples of two horses that tested positive for 
cocaine last year were disqualified by a Truesdail chemist because the chemist 
thought they had been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the one area when a horse's sample can be contaminated is during 
the time when the urine is taken from the horse," Foote said. "And that's a 
real concern." 
</P>
<P>
Stein said that in the investigation after the positive for Emperor's Turn, he 
fired a groom because the groom refused to submit to a urine test. Three other 
employees in Stein's barn consented to urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
Stein contends that he is being discriminated against after it was announced 
Sunday that Lukas and Barrera will be allowed to continue racing during their 
investigations.

DODGERS MAY BE BETTER, IF NOT JUST A LITTLE OLDER

There won't be the usual suspense when the Dodgers open spring training 
Thursday in Vero Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Gone is that annual rite of spring known as the Guerrero watch, which had 
players, coaches, writers and a certain manager idling away the early days of 
camp by speculating when Pedro Guerrero would grace the team with his presence. 
</P>
<P>
No more leaky roofs, Dominican independence day celebrations, or visa problems 
that used to delay his arrival. The unique torch carried by Guerrero throughout 
the 1980s has been passed on to the St. Louis Cardinals. One last toast, 
please, with Guerrero's beverage of choice. Pedro, this El Presidente's for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the Dodgers haven't eliminated all intrigue, or otherwise they could 
just fast-forward to opening day, six weeks hence, when they will open defense 
of their World Series championship in Cincinnati on April 3. 
</P>
<P>
On the lighter side, of course, is whether there is any mortal fool enough to 
Orosco-ize Kirk Gibson's cap, put itching powder in his spikes, or smear Crazy 
glue in his glove . . . and live to tell about it. Anybody seen Jesse Orosco 
lately? 
</P>
<P>
On the field, however, the questions are more serious in nature: 
</P>
<P>
 -- How many good left arms do you get when you combine Fernando Valenzuela 
with John Tudor? One? Two? 
</P>
<P>
Or is it three strikes and they're out? 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela will be the first critical test of spring. Tudor, if he pitches at 
all, isn't expected back until July after undergoing major reconstructive 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"All signs are good," said Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, 
speaking of Valenzuela. "He's as encouraged as he's been in some time. There's 
a lot of room for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary thing with John is to try to keep the reins on him, so he doesn't 
try to overdo it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of left-handers, is there a left-handed reliever in the house? 
Ricky Horton, by default, is something of an incumbent in that role, but the 
Dodgers would gladly have given Horton to the New York Mets last winter in a 
package for Wally Backman, who wound up with the Minnesota Twins instead. Keep 
an eye on Mike Munoz, who had a 1.00 earned-run average in double-A last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could add another pitcher, certainly we would like to do that," said 
Claire, who also lost prized setup man Brian Holton in the trade for Eddie 
Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can the pride of the New York Yankees, long-time captain Willie Randolph, 
compensate for the loss of the Dodgers' court and spark, Steve Sax, especially 
with Randolph facing his 35th birthday in July? 
</P>
<P>
"Sax's contributions to the ballclub last year, what he gave us, were 
significant," Claire said. "You knew he always was going to be playing. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an outstanding offensive player, and he gave everything he had 
defensively. 
</P>
<P>
"But as far as the ballclub overall, I think we'll be stronger in 1989. Willie 
gives us a lot defensively, he'll be well-served playing on grass, and he'll 
help us offensively. He's a smart player with an outstanding on-base 
percentage." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph is hardly alone, by the way, among Dodgers celebrating birthdays on 
the far side of 30. Of the nine players Manager Tom Lasorda is expected to 
inscribe on his opening-day lineup card -- assuming Orel Hershiser, 30, is his 
pitcher of choice -- only two, Mike Marshall, 29, and Jeff Hamilton, who will 
be 25 in March, are under 30. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Dodgers' top reserves, Rick Dempsey will be 40 in September, Mickey 
Hatcher 34 next month, and Mike Davis 30 in June. 
</P>
<P>
Old team? Not quite. A team susceptible to multiple breakdowns? Without a 
doubt, or haven't you noticed Kirk Gibson's knees lately? 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a number of years since we've had eight position players set," 
Claire said. "I'm not saying the door is closed to Franklin Stubbs, Mike Davis 
or Mariano Duncan, but they've got to be realistic about it. 
</P>
<P>
"If Tommy had to fill out his opening-day card today, there wouldn't be any 
surprises." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of the Dodgers' prospects, is Ramon Martinez, the 21-year-old right-handed 
pitcher, ready to step into the starting rotation? On the basis of his 
performance in winter ball -- 7-1, 1.63 earned-run average -- the answer would 
appear to be yes. Can Duncan, who expressed his willingness to kiss and make up 
with Lasorda, provide the kind of speed the Dodgers so lack without Sax? 
</P>
<P>
There will be relatively little competition among nonpitchers this spring, 
unless Claire satisfies the desires of Davis, Stubbs or both to be sent 
somewhere they can play every day. That would open a spot for Mike Devereaux or 
Chris Gwynn, but Claire sounded reluctant to part with either of his veteran 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike knows his fate is in our hands as to what happens this year," Claire 
said. "He would like to play every day, but he's not pounding on the door, 
because that's not Mike Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a very valuable part of our ballclub. I have as much confidence 
in Mike Davis' ability as I did the day I signed him. I don't care what the 
statistics say (.196 average, 2 home runs, 17 runs batted in during 1988)." 
</P>
<P>
 -- And finally, perhaps most importantly, will Eddie Murray -- who has driven 
in more runs than any other big league player in the '80s -- make anywhere near 
the impact that Gibson did upon his arrival? That's asking a lot, of course, 
considering that Gibson went home with the National League's most valuable 
player award last winter. But Murray has a wonderful chance to prove beyond a 
doubt that his career, at age 33, is not in decline, regardless of how he might 
have struggled for the first half of 1988 in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda probably has put his pet phrase of last spring, "Awesome Fivesome" into 
a deserved final resting place, but a projected middle of the lineup of Gibson, 
Marshall and Murray would rival any in the league for power and production. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Claire was executive vice president in charge of damage control, 
and rehabilitated a bad ballclub far beyond anyone's wildest expectations, 
except for maybe his own. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, he said he welcomes the challenge of becoming the first Dodger 
team ever to win consecutive World Series championships. No guarantees, a la 
Pat Riley of the Lakers. Merely a confidence that his team, if healthy, could 
make it two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"As exciting as last season was, it may not match what awaits us," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
No team has repeated as National League champion since the Dodgers of 1977 and 
'78. The '59 Dodgers, the first World Series winner in Los Angeles, finished 
fourth the next season. The '63 world champions finished sixth in '64. The '65 
champs were swept four straight by Baltimore in the '66 Series. And the '81 
winners failed to win the division title the following season, losing on the 
last day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not making any predictions, because I don't think it's done by making 
predictions," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now we have the opportunity to do something no Dodger team in history has 
ever done." 
</P>
<P>
And it never looks easier to do than in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger spring-training roster: 
</P>
<P>
PITCHERS (16): Tim Belcher, Tim Crews, Jeff Fischer, Mike Hartley, Orel 
Hershiser, Ricky Horton, Jay Howell, Chris Jones, Tim Leary, Ramon Martinez, 
Mike Munoz, Alejandro Pena, Ray Searage, John Tudor, Fernando Valenzuela, John 
Wetteland.

<P>
CATCHERS (4): Rick Dempsey, Carlos Hernandez, Gilberto Reyes, Mike Scioscia. 
</P>

Dave Hansen, Mickey Hatcher, Eddie Murray, Willie Randolph, Mike Sharperson, 
Franklin Stubbs, Jose Vizcalno, Tracy Woodson.

Gywnn, Mike Marshall, John Shelby.

BEGINNING OF ANOTHER HOTSHOT RIVALRY 
</P>

Another opening, another show. Monday night at Capital Centre the two most 
ardently wooed members of this season's freshman class, notwithstanding 
Louisiana State's Chris Jackson -- Georgetown's hammering 6-foot-11 Alonzo 
Mourning and Syracuse's versatile 6-8 Billy Owens -- played the first in what 
promises to be an eye-popping string of games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 0-1 against him," Owens sheepishly admitted after scoring a season-low of 
five points and watching helplessly as Mourning blocked two of his shots. Owens 
suffered through the worst game of his young career, missing eight of nine 
shots, often looking out of place, like he'd wound up taking the wrong bus. "I 
rushed things too much," Owens said, allowing how he, too, had been caught up 
in the hype about playing against his good friend Mourning. "I was worrying 
about how I performed instead of about winning the game." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning on the other hand was composed and outstanding. He had 14 points, nine 
rebounds and five blocks, adding to his astounding total of 116, best in the 
nation. "I grabbed him after the game to tell him how well he played," Owens 
said. "He said we had one more left, at the Dome, and I told him I'd be there." 
</P>
<P>
Eight seasons ago another such distinguished rivalry began, as celebrated 
freshmen who went on to become the best players in the sweet, short history of 
the Big East -- Chris Mullin of St. John's and Patrick Ewing of Georgetown -- 
locked up at Madison Square Garden in the first of 12 games against each other. 
It turned out to be the most lopsided, with Georgetown winning, 72-42. Ewing 
scored just nine points, and Mullin was shut out for the only time in his 
career, zero points in 32 minutes, an even more inauspicious start than Owens. 
"Nobody even remembers that game, or would dwell on it if they did," Billy 
Packer said advisedly. 
</P>
<P>
What people do remember is how the rise of the Big East paralleled the rise of 
Ewing and Mullin, and how, in their senior years, they floated above college 
basketball like angels. Together, their teams made four Final Four appearances, 
won one NCAA and four Big East championships and 80.8 percent of their games. 
</P>
<P>
As juniors, Ewing's team won the national title, but Mullin's team beat the 
Hoyas along the way, and Mullin antagonized Georgetown for 88 points in three 
games, shooting an exquisite 72.8 from the field, and 96-flat from the foul 
line. As seniors, Mullin's 20 points helped St. John's upset 18-0 Georgetown at 
Capital Centre and claim the No. 1 ranking. A month later at the Garden, on 
Feb. 27, 1985, in the most widely anticipated regular season game of the 
decade, Ewing's 20 helped Georgetown reclaim the ranking. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ewing-Mullin era was very, very big for the league," Jim Boeheim said 
appreciatively, recalling the pleasure he had in watching them play. "Billy and 
Alonzo are off to a good start. To duplicate Mullin and Ewing though, those are 
some big shoes to fill." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning and Owens have posted notably similar numbers. Going into Monday 
night's game, Mourning's averages of 13 points and 7.6 rebounds were slightly 
better than Owens' 12 points and 6.6 rebounds. Both were shooting well from the 
floor: 58 percent for Mourning and 55 for Owens. Although pale compared to 
Chris Jackson's, they are impressive numbers for freshmen, especially 
considering the multi-karat teams they joined. Mourning and Owens are babes, 
their best times still ahead. "He'll be a big player for them, and I think I'll 
be big for us," Owens said. "Every time we play, that'll be the match-up people 
look at." 
</P>
<P>
Mourning has had more impact, particularly with high-profile shot-blocking. But 
his impact is by design; he was brought in to solve a specific problem at 
Georgetown. "They had everything on the perimeter you would want, offensively 
and defensively, but were totally devoid of an inside attack," Packer observed. 
"Alonzo doesn't have to share the center's position with anyone." In contrast, 
Packer continued, "Owens enters a team that Sherman Douglas runs, and that has 
defined roles for Derrick Coleman, Stephen Thompson and Matt Roe. Billy kind of 
picks up what's left. The guys who are down on him are 'High School Hypers' who 
want him to score 22 per game. But this team is so talented, where would he get 
his 22? They'd have to change their whole system to revolve around Billy, and 
that's not in their best interest." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Owens has sweatered some of his game to better mesh with the boys from 
Syracuse -- with good reason, considering the experience and shooting 
percentages of Thompson (64.2), Coleman (60.0) and Douglas (56.6). Dick Vitale 
likens Owens' self-sacrifice to what Danny Ferry did his freshman year at Duke, 
accomodating himself to veteran stars Johnny Dawkins, Mark Alarie and Tommy 
Amaker on a team that reached the Final Four. "Like Danny, Billy's saying, I'll 
be the fourth option, I'll be the consummate role player. Billy didn't come in 
here saying, 'I'm coming in here, baby, and taking over, I'm the man!' I 
definitely think he could take over. But he's willing to sit back and say, 
'This is fine, we're winning.' Next year, though, you'll see Billy emerge as a 
true, true star." 
</P>
<P>
Should it happen that Mourning and Owens realize their vast potential, and 
become the players and leaders Ewing and Mullin were, a footnote to their story 
would be the recruiting weekend they spent at Syracuse. "They visited 
together," Boeheim said. "Alonzo enjoyed it. But there was never any doubt he'd 
go to Georgetown." Still, Boeheim allowed himself the luxury to daydream about 
having Owens and Mourning on the same team -- his team. "Coaches always have 
that eternal ray of hope." What Boeheim may not have known is that at a summer 
camp the year before Owens and Mourning had indeed talked about going to school 
together. "But Georgetown really didn't go after me," Owens said. Although he 
emphatically said that Syracuse was the right choice for him, when asked what 
he'd have done had Georgetown courted him, Owens grinned. "I might have gone," 
he said. "I might have gone."

RAIDER REBUILDING STARTS WITH INCREASE IN TICKET PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders have begun their rebuilding process in a strange spot -- their own 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a 7-9 season, their third straight year without a playoff berth and 
their lowest average attendance in five seasons, the club has raised ticket 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
It's a small raise, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-priced tickets will go from $28 to $30 a seat. That affects 27,000 
seats along the Coliseum sidelines. The rest of the tickets, priced at $20 and 
$13, remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
There was no official announcement of the change and no Raider official wished 
to be quoted. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the news was sent in a letter to season-ticket holders that read, in 
part: "Despite constantly escalating costs in every aspect of operation, the 
Raiders have made just a slight increase in some ticket prices for the first 
time in three years." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Raiders have about 40,000 season-ticket holders in the 92,000-seat 
plus Coliseum. Their average attendance last year was 52,6255. 
</P>
<P>
A Ram spokesman said that club plans no increase for 1989. Ram tickets run $25, 
$19 and $13. 
</P>
<P>
Three teams in the Raiders' division -- Seattle, Denver and Kansas City -- are 
raising some tickets an average of $5. STEVE SPRINGER

New York Yankee pitcher Charles Hudson, 6-6 last season with a 4.49 earned-run 
average, avoided arbitration by settling for a one-year contract worth 
$525,000. Hudson, who made $450,000 last year, asked for $580,000 in 
arbitration and the Yankees offered $475,000.

NEWSWIRE: NFLPA CHIEF UPSHAW CLEARED BY PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department has closed its investigation of the National 
Football League Players Assn. and union head Gene Upshaw after finding no 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw blamed the media, primarily the Boston Globe and the Ft. Wayne (Ind.) 
Sentinel for making "reckless charges" and creating a "trial by headlines." 
</P>
<P>
The financial records of the NFLPA and Upshaw have been under review by the 
U.S. attorney's office since October. The Globe reported in September that 
Upshaw illegally used union money and tried to conceal his actions. The 
Sentinel reported in January that Upshaw was about to be indicted on tax 
evasion charges.

MOUNT ST. MARY'S MAN FOR ALL SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EMMITSBURG, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Phelan, Mr. Bow Tie, is driving his Cadillac along the Old Emmitsburg Road. 
The land is snow-covered and divided by white fences. Sunk deep in his 
tilted-back seat, he has the wheel and all that he ever wanted of the world at 
his fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
He's just finished lunch at one of those roadside inns with wood floors and 
piping hot soup. Everyone knows him; the waiters call him "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's pointing against the car window toward his sprawling red-brick and 
white-wood house. It has eight bedrooms and three kitchens, and two individual 
apartments, one occupied by his 85-year-old mother. His five children grew up 
there. He calls it "a monstrous white elephant." 
</P>
<P>
It's nine-tenths of a mile from the main entrance to Mount St. Mary's College, 
"right on the glide path of graduates, players and friends. In fact, anybody 
looking for the school accidentally finds me." 
</P>
<P>
It could almost be said he is the school. As much as any basketball coach can 
be identified with a college, as John Wooden was to UCLA or Dean Smith is to 
North Carolina, Jim Phelan and the Mount are practically synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
In 35 years, the bushy-browed Phelan, who also is athletic director, became a 
king of the hardwoods in Division II. His 659 victories put him second to 
Winston-Salem State's Clarence "Bighouse" Gaines (790) among active college 
coaches, just ahead of Dean Smith (657). He's won almost 70 percent of his 
games, taking the Mount to the NCAA Division II tournament 14 times, to its 
final four five times (most recently in 1985) and to a national title once. At 
59, his hair wispy in front, he deserves to loosen his bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he has this whole new challenge. The school has presented him with a 
gem of a 3,500-seat arena, with big windows on a central corridor aligned with 
a main campus building and its cupola, and a mountain in the background. The 
Knott athletic complex replaced Memorial Gymnasium, known as "The Hangar" -- a 
World War II hangar shipped in pieces from the West Coast and reassembled in 
1950. The floor actually caved in twice. 
</P>
<P>
The first time, Phelan had been sitting in his office in the building. "I heard 
this huge noise. It sounded like thunder. I said, 'What the hell was that?' " 
He hurried around the corner and, to his amazement, "the whole gymnasium floor 
had sunk 18 inches."

Along with the new building, Phelan has a mandate to win -- in Division I. 
Partly because several traditional rivals have moved from II to I, said Phelan, 
the Mount (enrollment, 1,400) followed. But this is one of Phelan's most 
inexperienced teams; the record is 8-14. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't been through anything like this since going 6-17 in 1971-72. That 
season, he didn't wear bow ties because his children were embarrassed by them. 
The next season, he began wearing them again and, of course, won. But the 
answer to winning in Division I won't be found at his country haberdashery. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Phelan has always found a way. When Robert J. Wickenheiser became the 
school's president in 1977 and the team was coming off a rare losing season, 
Phelan recalled him asking, "What do you need to win?" For most coaches, it 
would have been a loaded question. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I think I need an assistant coach.' " All those years, he never had 
an assistant! 
</P>
<P>
"I said I needed a full-time assistant, primarily on the road, recruiting. Sure 
enough, the last 10 years have been the greatest 10 years I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
A man of few requests, and demands only of himself, Phelan is known for working 
persistently to elevate his players' talent (although he can't make them 
taller). His teams usually feature perimeter shooters, cutters and screeners 
and scrappers on defense. Once in a while, he strikes gold. 
</P>
<P>
In his Philadelphia hometown, Phelan discovered Fred Carter, who went on to 
play in the NBA from 1969 through 1977 and is now assistant coach of the 
Philadelphia 76ers. Carter was the Walt Frazier, the Magic Johnson of 
Emmitsburg. "I thought they would never stop yelling," said Phelan. And that 
was when Carter was introduced before his first game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the early '60s. A friend in Philadelphia called Phelan. 'Come up to this 
all-star game and see this prospect, John Baum.' After the game, Phelan 
approached Baum, who told him he had signed the day before with Temple. Phelan, 
with his friend, walked disconsolately from the arena. "Hey, you've come a long 
way," said the other man. "Let's go back." 
</P>
<P>
Carter had been the best player in the game, but he had dropped out of high 
school and more or less disappeared. Coaches were overlooking him. On a hunch, 
the two men hurriedly returned the one block, and found Carter walking out of 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a cigarette in his hand," recalled Phelan. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan's friend said to Carter, "Fred, come over here, I want you to meet a 
friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
Phelan settled back from his soup. To think, if only he could find another Fred 
Carter. ... 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me the best hand action I'd seen," said Phelan. "He had the 
cigarette jammed in his palm and had put it into his pocket, just like that. I 
mean, lightning quick. He said, 'Yeah, very happy to meet you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Happily, it turned out that Carter had his high-school diploma. After his 
father died, Carter had dropped out. But he had later returned to school, 
attending both day and night, earnest in his effort to graduate. He also held a 
job as he attended school. The persistent effort made an impression in the 
Mount's admissions office when Carter presented himself. Shortly, he was 
admitted. That August, Phelan picked up his 20-year-old freshman at the train 
station in Baltimore and the two headed west for school. 
</P>
<P>
"The farther into the country we got, he said, 'This is pretty far out.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Nah, it's not far.' " 
</P>
<P>
They drove some more. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Fred, there's not too many black kids in school.' 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'How many?' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'You.' " 
</P>
<P>
The best thing they did was not turn back. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'You don't have to worry about being a crusader or a pioneer.' I said, 
'Your biggest problem will be being lionized. You'll be a hero.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carter was, and took it in stride. He stayed four years and graduated. After 
his NBA playing career, he coached women's basketball here before he went into 
pro coaching. He often comes back to visit. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan came out of La Salle in 1951 -- his coach, Ken Loeffler, wore bow ties. 
He played for the Marines, briefly for the NBA's 1953-54 Philadelphia Warriors 
and the Pottstown Packers of the Eastern League. Competitor that he is, he 
still believes he'd have had a little longer NBA career ("I wouldn't have made 
a lasting impression") had he not been cut for a player who would play for a 
few hundred dollars less. 
</P>
<P>
One game when he was with Philadelphia, an injured teammate was unable to shoot 
his foul shots. The opposing coach, Clair Bee of the Baltimore Bullets, walked 
in front of the Philadelphia bench, looking for an unlikely fellow he could 
pick to shoot. "I was the only guy he didn't recognize," said Phelan. He made 
the two -- it turned out to be a highlight of his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, Tom Gola led La Salle to the NCAA title, with Phelan serving as an 
assistant to Loeffler. After the season, Loeffler said to him, "A little school 
in Emmitsburg, Md., needs a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Phelan and his wife, Dottie, also from South Philadelphia, drove into town, 
sized up the cows and wondered if this was for them. That was almost 1,000 
games ago. 
</P>
<P>
In his very first home game, the young Phelan caught the spirit of the crowd. 
After a year or so, his wife was settled in. He never meant to stay this long, 
it's just that one season led to another ... and another. 
</P>
<P>
And almost every one was filled with excitement. His record is packed with 
close victories. In 1962, the Mount won the NCAA Division II title game by a 
point in overtime, after winning triple- and quadruple-overtime games earlier 
in the season. In a fairly typical finish to a Phelan game, the Mount advanced 
in the 1985 NCAA tournament on a running 30-footer in the last seconds. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the victories haven't come easily, he's endured partly because he 
can relax, as he would say, "drop my pack." The Charles Town races are his 
"avocation"; one feature of the area that he said has helped keep him on the 
mountain is "year-round racing." 
</P>
<P>
He hustles up the steps and into the new building for an afternoon practice. 
"John Wooden," he said, "was 53 when he won his first championship. I'm still 
in my 50s -- barely." 
</P>
<P>
A few nights later, he was back on the team bus, heading to Baltimore and the 
first Beltway Classic. He has a way to go to make an impression in Division I. 
More than anything, he needs a big rebounder. Next season, the Mount will join 
the Northeast Conference, the old ECAC Metro. For now, he was trying to get 
past the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. A few minutes before game 
time at Loyola College, he followed his routine. He put on a brown bow tie to 
match his camel's-hair blazer and brown slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Phelan watched the game on the edge of his chair. Occasionally, he'd bolt to 
the edge of the floor and cry out in anguish at an official or one of his 
players. But he's not as prone to explosive outbursts as he was when he was 
younger. One story has it that during a halftime many years ago, he kicked a 
trash can, then hopped around in agony as his players tried to keep from 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
With 35 seconds to play and trailing UMBC by three, Phelan called time. He set 
up a play for any one of four outside shooters. With 12 seconds left, the only 
senior on the squad, Mike Tate, hit for three. Unfortunately for Phelan, UMBC 
dominated the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the story of our season," he said, drinking from a can of soda outside 
the basement locker room. "We don't play badly -- just bad enough to lose. 
</P>
<P>
"What the heck," he added, and forced a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he'd often done what seemed the impossible, and he wasn't 
finished yet.

GOLFERS DECIDE TO PLAY OUT A MIDWINTER NIGHT'S DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several members of the Valencia Country Club skidded their way through a few 
holes of golf last week during the freak snowstorm that dumped several inches 
on the course. In any of the last 25 years, playing golf in the snow at 
Valencia would certainly have been the weird occurrence of the winter. 
</P>
<P>
But not this winter. 
</P>
<P>
Not since Curtis (Corky) Knight and Dick Copra reacted to an early-evening 
hole-in-one by thrashing their way through six holes in total darkness in a 
frantic effort to make the ace legitimate under United States Golf Assn. rules, 
which require that nine consecutive holes be played to make a hole-in-one 
official. 
</P>
<P>
What they didn't know is that the rules say nothing about playing the nine 
holes on the same day and that they could have finished their quest the next 
morning, when their adventure might have been easier by the addition of a few 
little things, such as vision and a clue as to where they were. 
</P>
<P>
After having played the back nine, Knight and Copra, both of Newhall, decided 
to squeeze in three more holes before dark, No. 1, No. 2 and, to get back to 
the clubhouse, No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Then Knight, 42, got the hole-in-one on No. 7, a 190-yard, par-3. He cranked a 
three-iron at the flag as darkness began to swallow up the course. Neither 
Knight nor Copra saw the ball hit the green, but when they arrived at the flag 
they found Knight's ball in the cup. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to the green and didn't see his ball, so we assumed it was in the 
bunker behind the green," Copra said. "Corky was walking by the hole on his way 
to the bunker and he let out this big yell. I was about 10-feet away and about 
came out of my shoes. I walked over and pulled the ball out for him. We were 
howling. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured we had about 15 minutes of any light at all left, but Corky said we 
had to finish nine holes or it wouldn't count. So we took off, running." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the fast-fading light and sprinting from golf cart to his ball and 
back again, Knight birdied the next hole. By now, it was dark. Real dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't see our golf shoes," Copra said. 
</P>
<P>
By the next hole, the men couldn't see their teed-up golf balls. But Knight -- 
who had carded a hole-in-one at the age of 13 and another at 16 -- insisted 
they play on or this ace would not be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
They temporarily solved the problem by laying down lighted matches and burning 
cigarettes beside their golf balls, swinging at the orange glow that was 
reflecting off the ball. But as it got darker still, they were torching entire 
books of matches at once, laying them down beside the golf balls and flailing 
away. 
</P>
<P>
They found their golf balls on the fairway by first determining where the shots 
should have landed and then searching the area by the glow of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for Copra, the round ended shortly after 6:30. And luckily for Knight, 
because of the hour there were only two people at the bar to benefit from the 
tradition that calls for an ace shooter to buy a round of drinks for the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Knight got his hole in one, and the celebration cost him only $10. And his 
total score for the 18 holes of what turned out to be frenzied golf was a 71. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, not a bad Knight. 
</P>
<P>
Except, of course, that it wasn't necessary. Under USGA rules, Knight could 
have completed the rest of the required holes the next morning, thus saving 
himself lots of nervousness. And many matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't sure of the rules, and I wasn't going to let the hole-in-one get 
away from me," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there was one other thing that Knight was thinking about that night on 
the golf course. He was thinking how silly it was for a man with a medical 
condition known as night blindness to be out there. 
</P>
<P>
"Legally, I am blind at night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it didn't seem to matter that night. I was just playing so perfectly. I 
was in a zone." 
</P>
<P>
A zone, perhaps, that only Rod Serling could have appreciated.

A RELAXING FISHING TRIP MAY BE AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is more serene than a small outboard motorboat with two fishermen plying 
inland waters on a clear, calm summer afternoon? 
</P>
<P>
No ocean waves, no noise, no worries. Kick back, pop a can of beer, use the 
life jacket as a seat cushion -- and wait for an accident to happen. The 
fishermen in that situation may very well be on a collision course with 
disaster, in the form of a similar boat. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the U.S. Coast Guard show that combination of 
circumstances to be most prevalent in accidents afloat, partly because most 
people use that type of boat on the peak days of the boating season -- more 
boats, more accidents -- but also because of human nature. Who can get hurt 
going fishing? 
</P>
<P>
"Most hunters and fishermen do not consider themselves boaters," the Coast 
Guard says in its pamphlet on Federal Requirements for Recreational Boats. "To 
them, the boat is just another piece of equipment." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 million fishermen in the United States., about 80% fish from a boat, 
according to the National Marine Manufacturers' Assn. Of the 1,036 U.S. boating 
fatalities in 1987, 268 died while fishing, second only by groups to the 366 
who perished while simply "cruising." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Coast Guard believes that fishermen give less attention to their 
boats and safety than they do their bait and tackle, they certainly aren't the 
only careless boaters. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that of the 54 people killed in boating accidents in California last 
year, only 10 -- 18.5% -- were wearing Coast Guard-approved personal flotation 
devices (PFDs, or life jackets). In '87, the last year for which the Coast 
Guard's national figures are available, only 106 of the 1,036 victims wore 
proper PFDs. 
</P>
<P>
There is no law requiring a person to wear a PFD, only one saying that there 
must be one PFD for each person on board. 
</P>
<P>
But Coast Guard figures also indicate that about half of all boating accidents 
involve collisions with other vessels, not on stormy seas, where even foolish 
people might wear their PFDs, but on calm, inland waterways within shouting 
distance of shore, where many boaters wouldn't think of wearing them. 
</P>
<P>
"People feel safer on smooth water, close to shore," said Timothy Young of the 
Coast Guard Auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, it's a fatal error. 
</P>
<P>
PFDs weren't the main issue late one night in 1984, when nine people aboard a 
speeding, overloaded 20-foot jet boat struck an unlighted Navy buoy in Anaheim 
Bay, killing five -- the state's worst boating accident in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
There were no PFDs on board and a test showed that the driver's blood alcohol 
content to be above the 0.10 level considered legally impaired for an 
automobile driver. 
</P>
<P>
The incident helped to achieve a federal law passed in January of 1988 that 
requires specific information on the role of alcohol or drugs in boating 
casualties, with possible fines up to $6,000 and a year in prison if convicted 
with a level above 0.10. 
</P>
<P>
Other surveys have shown that 85% of boating accidents involve alcohol and 51% 
of those who died were over 0.10. A survey in Nevada showed 90% of the boats to 
have alcoholic beverages on board. 
</P>
<P>
There are no laws requiring anyone to be licensed to operate a private 
recreational boat, although 12 states -- but not California -- require some 
kind of certification for juvenile operators. Maryland, since last summer, has 
required certification that an operator born after July 1, 1972 must have taken 
a boating education course, and Maine and New Jersey are considering similar 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Many people close to boating doubt that licensing would help. 
</P>
<P>
"Licenses are required to drive an automobile on the road, but people still run 
into each other," said Ben Benites, a spokesman for the California Department 
of Boating and Waterways in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"If they ever decide on one, they should make it of Styrofoam 18 inches wide 
and about six inches thick and make everybody wear it. What I'm saying is, 
people don't wear life jackets, but it might save their lives if they had to 
wear that." 
</P>
<P>
The NMMF says a record 749,020 boats were sold in the United States last year 
and that California had 6,473,000 recreational boating participants in '88, far 
ahead of runner-up Texas with 4,448,000. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the Coast Guard figures also show that although there now are about 
three times as many recreational boats -- 17 million -- as there were in 1961, 
when it started keeping statistics, fatalities in that time span have declined 
from 20.8 per 100,000 boats to an all-time low of 6.1 for 1987, the most recent 
year documented. 
</P>
<P>
How can that be, when people still don't have to wear PFDs or be licensed to 
run a boat? 
</P>
<P>
Al Marmo, assistant chief of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, boating and consumer 
affairs division in Washington, said: "I think that could be attributed to the 
Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, which mandated a cooperative national boating 
safety program, coordinated by the Coast Guard. (It involves) the states, the 
Coast Guard, boating organizations and the boating industry, because we put our 
regulations that require certain construction standards on boats. 
</P>
<P>
"You combine all those factors, plus mandatory carriage requirements for PFDs 
and prompting manufacturers to develop more wearable PFDs, and that's why the 
fatalities have gone down." 
</P>
<P>
The 1971 legislation apparently did make a dramatic difference. Until then, the 
fatality rate per 100,000 boats was constant at about 20 but dipped to 16.9 in 
1972, plunged to 9.9 in 1976 and has been dropping ever since. 
</P>
<P>
What magic was this? 
</P>
<P>
Education. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Young, a project coordinator for an Anaheim air-conditioning firm, was 
at the Newport Dunes launching ramp in Newport Beach last weekend wearing his 
other hat -- that of a Coast Guard Auxiliary staff officer and vessel examiner. 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning," he said, politely greeting a family whose boat was backed down 
the ramp. "Would you like to have a courtesy examination?" 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard Auxiliary, created in 1939 to promote pleasure craft safety 
standards, is 50 years old this year. It was sidetracked during During World 
War II when members performed submarine patrol off the East Coast and served as 
"MacArthur's Navy," ferrying supplies in the South Pacific, but it has since 
become a force in safe boating, along with state and local agencies and boat 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
The auxiliary assists boaters in distress -- 23,342 in 1987, including 471 who 
might have otherwise perished -- runs boating classes year round, distributes 
millions of pamphlets, and since 1947 many of its 39,000 members have been 
conducting courtesy marine examinations at marinas and launching ramps all over 
the country, checking for items such as PFDs, fire extinguishers, lights and 
other safety items. 
</P>
<P>
The exam is voluntary and free, but the role of the examiner is often 
misunderstood. The auxiliary is only a civilian affiliate of the Coast Guard, 
composed entirely of unpaid volunteers using their own boats and airplanes, 
with no enforcement powers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one person who thought I was looking for a bribe," Young said. "He 
whipped out a $10 bill. One boat wouldn't let me examine them. It was an 
aluminum fishing boat with rivets coming out, littered with beer cans, no fire 
extinguisher." 
</P>
<P>
If a boat sails through the 15-point checklist, it receives a large decal to 
wear for the year. Young estimated that only about 40% pass the test the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of boats we know won't pass," Young said. "But we do it for the 
education benefits." 
</P>
<P>
The most common shortcoming? 
</P>
<P>
"Flares," Young said. "No (distress signal) flares. Either they don't have them 
or they've expired." 
</P>
<P>
Marine distress flares must be dated by the manufacturer and are good for 42 
months. Sometimes, Young said, he has found them floating in the bilge. 
</P>
<P>
Although the auxiliary's examiners have no enforcement powers, Young pointed 
out: "Inspection is mandatory anytime the Coast Guard or Harbor Patrol wants to 
do it. The things we point out are fineable violations." 
</P>
<P>
Young may seem like a nit-picker to some. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a mount for this?" he asked a boater, holding up an extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
"I did." 
</P>
<P>
"You need a mount for a sticker." 
</P>
<P>
"Why would that make a boat safer?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because you know where it is and it doesn't roll around in high seas." 
</P>
<P>
The boater rooted around in the boat and found the mount. He passed. 
</P>
<P>
Young checked another boater whose mother was confident the boat will pass. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been around boats all his life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the stern light didn't work and the flares were expired. No sticker. 
</P>
<P>
"And he was very knowledgeable about boats," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard issues recall orders to boat manufacturers for safety defects, 
but some responsible dealers also are stressing sanity over sales these days. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Napier, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Assn., advises 
people to make sure what they're buying is really what they want in a boat. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to use it for cruising, or to be a fisherman?" Napier said. "A 
lot of people buy a boat because it looks kind of neat, but it doesn't fit 
their needs." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Swan of Newport Beach has three boat dealerships that sold nearly 1,500 
boats worth $22 million last year. He also is president of the Southern 
California Marine Assn. that had its largest show at the L.A. Convention Center 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
"We have diverted people and lost the sale because they ultimately ended up 
confused," Swan said. "Conscientious salesmen try to guide people: 'I really 
think you want this boat, but we feel this other boat is the best for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Swan provides safety pamphlets and a videotape with every boat he sells. 
</P>
<P>
"The husband might say, 'I don't need that, I know how to run a boat.' But the 
wife will say, 'Hey, our kids are going to be on that boat,' " Swan said. "Our 
salesmen tell customers, 'You cannot go through that tape without learning 
something.' " 
</P>
<P>
Swan doubted the value of licensing operators as "more of a nuisance factor . . 
. (creating an) enormous bureaucracy that would be a detriment to the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
He also disputed the Coast Guard's view of fishermen as boaters. 
</P>
<P>
"In my personal opinion, fishermen are probably the safest boaters in the 
world," he said.

COMPETITION SHOULD BE FIERCE FROM THE START

<P>
With no byes, no at-large entries and no easy games, the 3-A division of the 
Southern Section boys' basketball playoffs is, in a word, tough. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with the other eight divisions, the 3-A has the best depth, basically 
making this year's championship wide open. 
</P>
<P>
"The 3-A? I like it," said Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien, whose Eagles are one of 
11 Orange County schools in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's solid top to bottom -- there's no dominating teams. And because there 
aren't any byes, whoever wins the championship is going to have to play five 
tough games." 
</P>
<P>
Starting with the first round. Most coaches agree that even the top-seeded 
teams -- No. 1 Rolling Hills, No. 2 La Canada, No. 3 Savanna and No. 4 
Morningside -- might not see the light of second-round action. Competition is 
that fierce. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this first-round matchup: Corona del Mar (15-9, third in the Sea View 
League) at El Dorado (20-4, first in Empire League). 
</P>
<P>
Though Corona del Mar's record isn't too impressive, the Sea Kings waged a 
hearty nonleague campaign against larger schools -- many more than twice their 
size. Corona del Mar defeated such playoff teams as Irvine, Los Alamitos, Dana 
Hills and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
And, El Dorado, which was 10-0 in league play, is riding a 14-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be either one of those teams," Brea-Olinda Coach Rick Jones 
said. "That (matchup) is scary." 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches, while saying the division is wide open, sided with the top-seeded 
teams as their favorites. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the top four: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rolling Hills (22-4). Led by 6-foot-4, 230-pound senior John Hardy, who 
averages 28 points a game, the Titans shoot well from inside and out, like to 
run and press, and do both well. 
</P>
<P>
They also have great playoff experience under Cliff Warren, who, in three years 
as coach, led Rolling Hills to the 1986 quarterfinals, the 1987 final (which it 
lost to Saugus) and the 1988 semifinals (which it lost to eventual champion 
Kennedy). 
</P>
<P>
 -- La Canada (23-2). The Spartans have a returning all-Southern Section player 
in 6-7 center Chad Givens, and a starting lineup that averages 6-6. La Canada 
plays a control-oriented offense, but is effective on the run as well. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Savanna (23-2). The Rebels, ranked fourth in Orange County, feature 
talented sophomore Mustapha Abdi and senior Tim Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
"I have guarded optimism," Savanna Coach Tom Gregory said. "But since all 
playoff games are sudden death, every game is a war." 
</P>
<P>
If the Rebels get through their first-round game against Azusa, they could find 
themselves in an interesting matchup with Trabuco Hills, one of many teams 
considered to be a dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Morningside (20-4). A team with maybe the best quickness and the best 
athletes in the division, Morningside features well-balanced scoring, height 
and depth. Jeff Crowe, a 6-7 junior center, 6-7 forward Chris Vance and 6-6 
forward Eddie Scott (cousin of Laker guard Byron Scott) lead the Monarchs, 
which swept the Ocean League at 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the Orange County teams involved: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trabuco Hills (17-6) has one of the division's best players in 6-10, 
225-pound center Rick Swanwick, who is averaging 20.3 points and 13.5 rebounds 
and is shooting 62% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Estancia (19-5), led by Mike Curtis, Augustin Heredia and Tim Kjar, is a 
feisty team able to outduel stronger, taller teams by intensity alone. The 
Eagles, who came within three points (58-55) of upsetting Saddleback, are 
especially dangerous from three-point range. A three-game losing streak might 
signal distress. 
</P>
<P>
 -- La Quinta (18-5) has the county's scoring leader in senior Scott Campbell 
(28.9 points a game). Campbell also leads the county in making 62.7% of his 
three-point shots. Although Campbell was flat last Friday -- held to a 
season-low five points by Pacifica -- La Quinta proved with a 25-point 
performance from James Johnson it's more than a one-player team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brea-Olinda (19-7) is led by Keith Walker (26 points per game). A bigger 
plus? The Wildcats are, for the first time this season, completely healthy and 
injury-free. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Western (16-6), probably the best third-place team along with Corona del 
Mar, is a dark horse choice by many. Joe Romero leads the team with 17.6 points 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Foothill (15-10), a team that had no returning letterman from last year, 
has been a surprise. The Knights are led by 6-4 forward Mark Wilkinson (16.8 
points) and guard Ward Van Pelt (7.7 assists). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rancho Alamitos (12-9) is led by Gary Lira (15.7 points) and Richard Pearce 
(9.7 rebounds). Rancho Alamitos has won its past six games, including a 61-51 
upset over Kennedy Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laguna Hills (15-9) has four-year starting guard Chris Sheff, who is 
averaging 18.7 points a game. The Hawks' first-round game against La Quinta 
will be a real test. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3-A IN A BOX

Teams to beat: Rolling Hills (22-4), La Canada (23-2), Savanna (23-2) and

CAPISTRANO VALLEY HAS BEEN CLOSE, BUT HASN'T WON A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Will Capistrano Valley High School finally win that elusive Southern Section 
basketball title in 1989? Or will Pasadena return to its glory days of the 
1970s when it advanced to four large-school championship games in seven years? 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley has advanced to the semifinals five times in seven seasons 
under Coach Mark Thornton. The Cougars have played in two championship games, 
losing to Simi Valley in overtime, 70-64, for the 4-A title last year and to 
Ridgecrest Burroughs, 66-55, in the 2-A title game in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Will the third time be a charm? Several coaches in the 5-A division think so. 
Capistrano Valley (20-4) is seeded second behind Pasadena (22-2). 
</P>
<P>
"I scouted Capistrano Valley last Wednesday, and I'd have to say they're the 
class of the 5-A division," said John Dahl, veteran coach at Moreno Valley. 
"They've got everything . . . a solid point guard, good height, excellent 
shooting and a great player in (Scott) McCorkle." 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle averages 24.1 points per game for Capistrano Valley, which has won 11 
consecutive games since losing to Saddleback, 57-53, in the semifinals of the 
Orange Holiday tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the improved play of point guard Chris Kostoff that carried the 
Cougars to 10 consecutive victories in the South Coast League. Kostoff made 36 
of 62 attempts from three-point range and boosted his scoring average to 15 
points per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Kostoff has made them a better team," said Rich Skelton, the Dana Hills coach. 
"It's difficult to imagine anyone better than Capistrano Valley or Irvine in 
the division." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton, who cringed when Capistrano Valley was made the preseason choice as 
Orange County's top-ranked team ahead of Mater Dei, isn't discounting his 
team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a really good playoff team in the past, and I feel we're just 
starting to hit our stride," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (21-5) is seeded fourth. Second-year Coach Steve Keith is aiming for his 
third Southern Section championship, having won the 4-A title in 1985 and the 
2-A title in 1981, both while at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine has stumbled recently, losing two of its past three games. Not exactly 
the type of momentum a coach wants going into the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there was something tangible I could point to, like an injury or 
sickness to explain the way we finished the season," Keith said. "We had a 
taxing preseason, but I thought it was important for our program to win those 
tournaments. (Irvine won the Irvine World News and Coast Christmas 
tournaments.) 
</P>
<P>
"We came up short on the gas tank at the end of the season, but with a week 
off, we'll have time to recharge our batteries." 
</P>
<P>
Keith, who had some memorable games against Pasadena for the Pacific League 
title while at Glendale, expects Pasadena to be a strong challenger for the 5-A 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"They were down a few years and took a back seat to Muir, but this year marked 
a return to their glory years," Keith said. "They're athletic and quick." 
Pasadena guard Idris Jones, who averages 20.7 points, 5 rebounds, 4 steals and 
3 assists per game, has signed to attend UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (19-4) is seeded third and was the runner-up to Rio Mesa in the Channel 
League. Buena advanced to the 4-A quarterfinals last year before being 
eliminated by Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Buena is one of the best three-point shooting teams in Southern California. 
Junior guard Jeff Oliver averages 18 points per game but 6-foot-5 center Adan 
Valencia is the only player with good size on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Among the unseeded teams, Ocean View (17-8) is the strongest entry. Ocean 
View's record is deceiving, with six of its losses coming against Mater Dei 
(twice), Fountain Valley, St. Paul, Huntington Beach and Edison, all playoff 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I noticed when I picked up the playoff sheet was that Ocean 
View was in our bracket, and I didn't like that," Capistrano Valley's Thornton 
said. "I've always thought they were the best team we've played all year." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View defeated Capistrano Valley, 72-62, in the semifinals of the 
Tournament of Champions, despite a 35-point performance by McCorkle. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a sleeper? Edison (14-12) is the only team to beat 2-A powerhouse 
Santa Clara, and Coach Jon Borchert's teams have a habit of disrupting favored 
opponents with strong defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
But Edison won't be playing its second-round game on its home court Friday 
night. School officials discounted the team's chances of making the playoffs 
before the season. They scheduled a divisional championship wrestling match in 
the school's gymnasium. 
</P>

COUNTY TEAMS MIGHT HAVE SHORT STAYS

Call the Southern Section 4-A boys' basketball playoff draw the bye-bye 
bracket. Eight teams have first-round byes, including the four top-seeded 
teams: Dominguez (20-4), St. Paul (19-7), Rio Mesa (20-4) and Barstow (21-3). 
</P>
<P>
The four Orange County entries, which did not receive byes, will be lucky to 
get by the first round. Look for them to wave goodby long before play reaches 
UC Irvine's Bren Center, the site of the final on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Travel will definitely be a factor in the race, with home sites ranging from 
Barstow, halfway to Las Vegas in the high desert of San Bernardino County, to 
Rio Mesa in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez's seeding is no surprise. The Dons have been atop the 4-A poll the 
entire season. They have offensive balance with four players in double figures. 
Xavier Edison, a 6-foot-4 forward, leads with 14 points, followed by 6-3 
left-hander Dijon Bernard (13.5), forward Derrick Thomas (10.3) and Cory 
Cothrine (10.1). Dominguez has played a tough schedule too, defeating Perris, 
third-seeded in the 4-AA, in nonleague play. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul is a consensus pick to make the final because of its tough schedule. 
The Swordsmen played 14 teams that ranked in the top 10 of various California 
and Nevada polls. They have Jason Hart, who is four three-point baskets away 
from the Southern Section record of 99 set last season by Glendora's Tracy 
Murray. St. Paul also boasts one of the 4-A's best players in 6-7 forward Greg 
Willig, who averages 27.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Barstow, seeded fourth, has only three losses and they were all to San 
Bernardino (26-0), the top-seeded team in the 4-AA. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa is a solid team led by guard Jeff Garner. And Charter Oak (21-4) has 
6-8 Jeff Vonlutzow, who will play for UC Irvine next season, and 6-4 Shane 
Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
Even with one of the top players in the state, 6-8 1/2 junior forward Ed 
O'Bannon (28-point average), Artesia (18-5) will have a tough time reaching the 
final in a bracket with St. Paul and Rio Mesa. Artesia has a first-round bye 
and plays the winner of the Pioneer-Fullerton game on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Fullerton (16-6), the Orange County teams -- Woodbridge 
(9-12), Cypress (11-13) and La Habra (13-11) -- do not even qualify as dark 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
One Orange County team is sure to be out after the first round because 
Woodbridge and Cypress play at Woodbridge. The Warriors, led by junior Joey 
Cohen (15.7 points a game) are led primarily by sophomores and juniors. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of that game will have to play Dominguez in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra, under second-year Coach Frank McCarroll, has 13 victories this 
season, one more than the Highlanders managed in the past four years. La Habra 
must travel to Riverside to take on John W. North (18-7), and McCarroll has no 
illusions about his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just happy to be here," he said. "We haven't been in the playoffs in 
five years. We are just trying to re-establish the tradition we had a few years 
ago here, and we felt this team could be a good foundation for coming years." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton has the best record of any county team in the 4-A. The Indians, led 
by the youngest coach in the county, Chris Burton, 23, have come back to win 
from double-figure deficits in five games. That and the savvy and shooting of 
three-point specialist Rene Arias (55 of 88 three-point baskets) and Pete Bach 
(19.6 points a game) elevate Fullerton from obscurity to the status of long 
shot, one level below a dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (13-11) might have a chance. The Tarbabes are the only 4-A team in the 
tough Moore League, which features five 5-AA teams, all of which advanced to 
the playoffs. Compton was 11-3 before league play, including a victory over 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>

On the schedule, the 2-A Southern Section boys' basketball playoffs begin 
today. 
</P>
<P>
But in a division that coaches say will be dominated by Orange Lutheran and 
Santa Clara, the important competition doesn't start until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The top three seeded teams, which have a combined 61-8 record, won't be playing 
in today's first round. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, top-seeded Santa Clara (20-3) and No. 2 Orange Lutheran (21-3), will 
play their first games on Friday. The same goes for third-seeded Paraclete 
(20-2). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, of the teams that play today, only St. Anthony (10-11) is expected to 
be any kind of threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will come down to us, Santa Clara and St. Anthony," Orange Lutheran 
Coach Jerry Simmons said. "But I'm sure there's other teams out there that can 
win it. Anytime you put five guys on a court anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches aren't quite that open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Clara is the team to beat," Beaumont Coach Alex Boyd said. "But then 
again you can't count out Orange Lutheran." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran, which swept through the Olympic League with a 14-0 record, can 
rest today while Beaumont and Notre Dame of Riverside fight for the right to 
meet the Lancers in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I'd rather not have a bye in the first round," Simmons said. "I'd 
rather we play in the first round, especially if we don't get a home game." 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, Orange Lutheran, led by Pat Bagatourian and his 20 points and 11 
rebounds per game, will be rooting for a Beaumont victory, which would mean a 
home game for the Lancers Friday. Otherwise, the road to the Los Angeles Sports 
Arena and the finals March 4 will begin for Orange Lutheran at Notre Dame in 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-A IN A BOX 
</P>
<P>
Top teams: Santa Clara (20-3), Orange Lutheran (21-3), Paraclete (20-2).

</P>
<P>
Top players: Alan Aragon (St. Anthony), Pat Bagatourian (Orange Lutheran), 
Shaun Tarver (Santa Clara), Jeff Zelenski (Paraclete).

Beaumont (15-6) at River side Notre Dame (11-12).

When push came to shove, Southern California College had a foul to give. 
</P>
<P>
After squandering a 15-point halftime lead, the Vanguards needed a well-timed 
shove by Kyle Lundy in order to hold off Westmont, 82-80, in a showdown of 
Golden State Athletic Conference powers. 
</P>
<P>
With the crowd of 1,057 at Murchison Gymnasium on its feet and only 1 second 
left, Westmont's Mike Kelly lobbed an inbound pass to 6-foot-5 Dan Swanner, who 
outleaped Lundy for the ball a mere eight feet from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Lundy shoved Swanner at the buzzer, before he could attempt a shot. However, 
the Warriors were not in the bonus, so no free throws were awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Game over. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a couple fouls to give, so we told the kids that if they could steal 
the ball, foul," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "When the ref signaled it wasn't 
a shot attempt, I said, 'Thank you, Lord.' " 
</P>
<P>
By winning their 14th consecutive game, the Vanguards (24-2 overall, 11-0 in 
conference play) all but clinched the conference championship. They have a 
two-game lead over Westmont (15-10, 9-2) with three games remaining in 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont had a golden opportunity to take the lead in the final 40 seconds. A 
steal and a layup by Mike Kelly (22 points) pulled the Warriors to within 81-80 
and another steal by Kelly gave them a chance to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Peter Partain drove to the hoop and appeared to have John Mounce beaten. 
However, Mounce reached in from behind and batted the ball free. He was then 
fouled and made one of two free throws for an 82-80 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just hanging on by our fingernails the whole second half," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California made 29 of 49 field goals (59%). The Vanguards' shooting 
offset the fact they were outrebounded, 32-21. 
</P>
<P>
Lundy (23 points), Terry Scruggs (23) and Jeff Bickmore (21) did the most 
damage. But mostly in the first half, when the Vanguards shot 50% to the 
Warriors' 38%. 
</P>
<P>
In another Golden State Athletic Conference men's game: 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma 118, CC Irvine 92 -- Ron Hubbard scored 22 points to lead visiting 
Point Loma (10-15, 4-4). Keith Rodgers scored 32 points for Christ College 
(4-21, 0-11). 
</P>
<P>
In a Golden State Athletic Conference women's game: 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma 76, Christ College Irvine 66 -- Michelle Ferris scored 17 points and 
Sara Klein 14 for host Irvine (7-19, 1-7).

NORTHROP SUES EX-AIDE OVER S. KOREAN DEALS

<P>
Aerospace contractor Northrop Corp. is suing Honolulu businessman James Shin to 
recover $6.25 million allegedly paid to him and several South Korean 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court here, the money paid 
from 1984 to 1986 was to assist "Northrop's business activities in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based manufacturer also has filed a civil lawsuit in South 
Korea to recover the money Northrop says was to have financed construction of a 
hotel and office complex in Seoul. The hotel was never built and the money, 
paid into a Korea Exchange Bank account in Hong Kong, disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. government investigators say the money may be part of about $7.75 million 
allegedly paid by Northrop to help sell its ill-fated F-20 fighter jet. The 
payments are being investigated by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, by a 
U.S. congressional committee and by the government of South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1-Million Check 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigators are trying to determine whether the Northrop payments 
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have not been able to reach Shin, 51, the former operator of a 
Honolulu nightclub, for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's suit alleged that Shin secretly received a $1-million check from the 
Hong Kong bank account in August, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In a divorce case filed against Shin last April, his wife said Shin had been 
employed as an overseas aircraft sales consultant for Northrop at a salary of 
$8,500 a month, plus expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop suit says Shin was hired in April, 1983, "as a consultant and 
adviser in support of Northrop's business activities in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the suit says, "Northrop began considering an investment in a joint 
venture with Asia Culture Travel Development Co., a Korean corporation." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photocopy surfaces 
</P>
<P>
The suit says Shin participated in discussions for Northrop, and the two sides 
agreed to build a hotel and office complex in Seoul to assist Northrop's 
marketing efforts in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Asia Culture was controlled by Chong Kyu Park, a politically well-connected 
South Korean who once served as chief bodyguard to the president of South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1984, 20 days after Northrop put $6.25 million into the Hong Kong 
bank account of Asia Culture, Shin received a $1-million check drawn on the 
account and concealed it because it was a conflict of interest, according to 
the Northrop suit. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop learned of the $1-million check in March, 1988, when a photocopy 
surfaced in Northrop's civil fraud lawsuit in South Korea, according to the 
suit here. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's relationship with Shin is believed to have ended in early 1987.

ORANGE COUNTY CONTINUES TO LEAD U.S. IN MEDIAN PRICE; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTHLAND HOME COSTS SOAR AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County's superheated housing market led the nation with a median home 
price of $231,200 in the fourth quarter of 1988, and other Southern California 
metropolitan areas were close behind, the National Assn. of Realtors reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive quarter in which the median price for a resale 
home in Orange County topped the list of 62 metropolitan areas surveyed by the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
The county also led the nation in price appreciation during the fourth quarter, 
with the median price representing a 32.2% increase from the final three months 
of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco had the nation's second-highest home price at $228,100 for the 
fourth quarter, an increase of 29.6%, while the median price in Honolulu ranked 
third at $225,000, up 16.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County posted the fourth-highest median price at $191,200, up 24.6% 
from the fourth quarter a year ago. San Diego ranked eighth, with a median 
resale price of $157,200, up 18.6%. The Riverside-San Bernardino area placed 
11th at $113,200, up 16.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Home prices in Southern California -- and especially in Orange County -- have 
climbed well above the national norm because of the area's strong economy and 
its desirability as a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland economy has been diverse enough, and family incomes high enough, 
to avoid the regional recessions that have caused the housing market to 
stagnate in the industrial Northeast and sent prices plummeting in the Oil 
Patch states of Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The national median for the fourth quarter was $87,900, up a scant 3.4% from 
the same period a year earlier, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey reflects resales of single-family detached homes and does not 
include new homes or attached housing such as condos. The median price 
represents the midpoint, with half the homes selling for more and half for 
less. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the survey, Oklahoma City saw resale prices drop 10.1% to 
finish in 62nd place with a median of $53,500 -- less than 25% of the Orange 
County median for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
If reports from home shoppers in much of Southern California are any 
indication, housing price shock syndrome might well become an ailment 
recognized by the psychiatric community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Not Moving 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every person I've had from one of the lower-priced areas who has 
inquired about housing prices around here has been absolutely shocked," said 
Joan Wilson, a sales agent with Grubb &amp; Ellis Real Estate in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who who didn't have to move here because they were being transfered 
mostly decided not to come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For Jim and Dianne Kaufman, there was no choice. He's Lt. James Kaufman, an air 
traffic control officer in the Marine Corps who was transferred from Memphis, 
Tenn., to El Toro just a little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
When the couple arrived in Orange County, the median price of a single family 
home on the resale market was $175,000. There was no way they were going to pay 
that kind of price, Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Kaufmans had been living in Memphis, where a very nice house 
could be had for $50,000 or less, and had grown up in Minnesota, where prices 
were only slightly higher than those in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real culture shock," Kaufman said, "and it has gotten worse." 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, the Kaufmans have rented in the El Toro area. They 
originally paid $650 a month for a one-bedroom condominium -- comparable to 
their $250-a-month apartment in Memphis -- and later moved up to a two-bedroom 
condo for $760 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with a year left on his tour at El Toro, Kaufman and his wife have just 
about decided to buy a place and are making the rounds with agents. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe the prices," he said. "We're talking about doubling our 
monthly costs to buy a condo in the $125,000-$130,000 range." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kaufman said he is likely to be transferred to an overseas post next 
year, he and his wife are considering buying a home in Orange County at this 
late date because of the area's "fantastic" real estate appreciation rates. He 
said that if they buy, they would either sell for a quick profit when he is 
transferred or hang on to the property for long-term appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 3.99 million resale homes were sold in 1988, the highest annual 
total since 1979's 4.05 million. That was despite rising interest rates over 
the past year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Areas Declined 
</P>
<P>
While prices in Southern California posted the nation's biggest appreciation 
rates, costs in several Northeastern cities -- where housing prices remain 
among the highest in the nation -- showed little escalation and in some cases 
posted declines. 
</P>
<P>
Prices in fifth-ranked Boston, for example, rose only 3% to a median of 
$182,800. 
</P>
<P>
And in sixth-place metropolitan New York, an area including Long Island and 
northern New Jersey, the median dipped 3.6% to $178,500. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Northeast, prices have basically run away from family income," said 
John A. Tuccillo, the association's chief economist. "The market is slowing 
down there until incomes can catch up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Coleman Co., the outdoor equipment maker whose sturdy lanterns and stoves are 
standard American camping gear, said Tuesday that its board is considering a 
possible $450.6-million management buyout offer. 
</P>
<P>
Shares of the Wichita, Kan.-based company soared $21 to $70.125 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, above the $64-a-share buyout price. Analysts said the stock 
jumped on a belief that another suitor may emerge. 
</P>
<P>
"My view is they can go higher," said analyst Daniel Coleman of Seattle firm 
Ragen &amp; Mackenziean. "It is worth between $65 and $70 a share." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a management leveraged buyout and all management LBOs are eventually 
sweetened," said one trader. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, led by Coleman Chairman and Chief Executive Sheldon Coleman, 
consists of $54 cash and $10 a share in preferred stock. Coleman's board was 
scheduled to meet late Tuesday to discuss the proposal and expects to make a 
further announcement this morning, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst Coleman, who is not related to the chairman, said the camping 
concern has many desirable brand names in its Coleman lanterns, stoves and 
coolers, Mastercraft ski boats and O'Brien water skis. 
</P>
<P>
"It has great brand names," he said. "Most leveraged buyout firms will have to 
look at it, as well as foreign investors and maybe leisure products companies 
like Brunswick Corp. or Outboard Marine Corp." Brunswick declined comment, 
while Outboard Marine was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the company might be auctioned off to the highest bidder. "The 
chairman may be putting the company in play to solicit other bids for it," one 
trader said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman earned $22.7 million, or $3.23 a share, on revenue of $517 million for 
the nine months ended Nov. 30. Its chairman said in November that the company 
should earn between $3.40 and $3.50 a share for the full year.

Kobe Steel Ltd. became the last of Japan's big integrated steelmakers to join 
with a comparable U.S. producer when it announced a joint venture with USX 
Corp. in Pittsburgh. Kobe will pay an undisclosed sum to buy half of USX's 
Lorain, Ohio, plant. The deal is at least the 11th such joint venture completed 
or under consideration. Analysts said the Japanese seek the ventures because 
import quotas and unfavorable currency exchange rates make it hard for 
foreigners to penetrate U.S. markets. American firms see the Japanese as a 
source of capital and expertise in producing high-quality steel for autos, the 
metal's biggest end use.

Ortho Pharmaceutical will initially pay a 5% royalty to Amgen Inc. to sell the 
anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO, less than the 10% royalty some Wall 
Street analysts had expected. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Jeffrey Swarz 
said the information is in a licensing agreement contained in a Delaware 
lawsuit filed by Ortho against the Thousand Oaks biotechnology firm in a 
dispute over their marketing agreement. Swarz said Amgen will receive the 5%

Akzo NV became the first company from any nation to receive a U.S. patent in 
the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The Dutch chemical company 
upset a wide range of U.S., Japanese and European companies that have been 
working in the field. Superconductors carry electricity without any loss of 
energy and could someday be part of tiny computers that run at unprecedented 
speeds, batteries that last forever and other technological marvels. Although 
Akzo is based in Arnhem, Netherlands, it said its research was done at its 
laboratory in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., by Fawzy A. Sherif.

Smith &amp; Wesson is trying to sell a new line of handguns to women, but 
several leading women's magazines are refusing to carry the gun maker's 
advertisements for the petite "LadySmith" .38 caliber revolvers. "We would not 
accept that category of advertising," said John de Holl, director of 
advertising services for Woman's Day magazine in New York. Woman's Day is not 
alone. Smith &amp; Wesson officials say New York-based Conde Nast Publications, 
including Mademoiselle, Glamour and Self, and Des Moines-based Meredith Group's 
Better Homes &amp; Gardens all have rejected ads for the LadySmiths.

PENNY STOCK FIRM UNDER INVESTIGATION FOLDS

<P>
A penny stock firm accused of defrauding thousands of customers has shut down 
its operation, citing the financial crunch of a flood of investors seeking 
their money back. 
</P>
<P>
Power Securities Corp. announced that it was terminating all retail sales 
activities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The closure of the Las Vegas office comes less than a week after New York Atty. 
Gen. Robert Abrams accused Power of defrauding thousands of investors of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Behringer, Las Vegas branch manager for the firm, said Power was closing 
because it could not meet net capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a rush on the bank," he said. "A lot of stock came back at us. We 
couldn't meet net (capital) and we had to close our doors." 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Securities Division urged Power customers to make arrangements 
immediately to have their accounts transferred to other brokerage firms or 
request delivery of their funds and stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our agency will be monitoring the situation closely and will take further 
action if the situation warrants," said Sherwood Cook, deputy secretary of 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Power attorney Gilbert McSwain said in a statement that the run by investors 
probably was triggered by Abrams' actions against the company and "not the 
public's lack of confidence in the penny stock market." 
</P>
<P>
Penny stocks are low-priced, high-risk securities sold over the counter. They 
are not listed on any major exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
A New York judge last week temporarily barred Power from soliciting business in 
the state after Abrams said records showed Power had manipulated stock prices, 
created artificial markets and marked up stock prices by 100% or more. A Feb. 
22 hearing in the case is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Power Securities was founded in 1987 by two Rochester, N.Y., natives, Richard 
T. Marchese, 29, and Eric G. Monchecourt, 27, and Orville L. Sandberg, 62, of 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
It employed 106 salespeople in four offices in New York state. An additional 
400 around the country are registered to solicit business in the state, Abrams 
said. The company said it had 1,300 employees nationwide.

Led by poor sales at Chrysler, domestic auto sales dove 17.8% in the first 10 
days of February, the auto industry reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Auto analysts said the period's slumping sales may indicate an overall slowdown 
in the auto market. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not too surprised," said Cynthia Certo, an auto analyst with Integrated 
Automotive Resources, an automotive research firm in Wayne, Pa. "General 
Motors, Ford and Chrysler are all suffering, with Chrysler's sales down the 
most." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts suggested that something may be needed to shake up the market. "I 
think the companies are going to have to come out with more incentives or cut 
production," auto analyst Michael Luckey of Luckey Consulting Group told 
Associated Press.

BACA: A POET EMERGES FROM PRISON OF HIS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As success stories go, it's a grisly one. 
</P>
<P>
By his own account, Jimmy Santiago Baca's parents divorced and abandoned him to 
a grandparent when he was 2. Later, his mother was murdered by her second 
husband and his father died of alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
By 5, the young mestizo (half Chicano/half "detribalized Apache") was abandoned 
again, left at a New Mexico orphanage where he stayed until he was 11, running 
away the night before he was to be transferred to Boy's Town. 
</P>
<P>
He swiftly became a teen-age street urchin, alcoholic, drug addict and 
wanderer. At age 20, convicted of drug possession with intent to sell, he wound 
up, he said, doing 6 1/2 years (for incorrigibility, on a five-year sentence) 
in one of Arizona's toughest maximum security prisons. Because he consistently 
got into fights with his cellmates, he spent four of those years in isolation, 
in "a dungeon," with, Baca claims, no sunshine save for a single hour once each 
week. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taught Himself to Read 
</P>
<P>
But in the darkness, Baca was reborn. He taught himself to read and write, 
shouting to inmates, for instance, when he became dazzled by the difference 
between nouns and verbs, "Hey Flaco! Do you know what you are? Do you know, 
brother, that you are a noun???!!!' " 
</P>
<P>
"He found his inner light and he worked by it," said Will Inman, the former 
publisher of New Kauri poetry magazine, who began encouraging and visiting Baca 
while he was still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for his fifth book of poems, "Martin &amp; Meditations on the South 
Valley," Baca won the prestigious American Book Award. And suddenly, the inmate 
who called himself "healing earthquake" is indeed shaking up the literary 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Baca -- whose semi-autobiographical work is noted for its intense, primal 
imagery and poignant lyricism -- is now in demand for poetry readings 
throughout the world (one of which is scheduled at the Los Angeles Theatre 
Center on April 17). 
</P>
<P>
PBS is preparing a documentary on his life. And he's being courted by famous 
literary agents. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous universities have offered him teaching jobs, all of which he said he's 
turned down, preferring to stay close to his beloved Albuquerque barrio with 
his wife, Beatrice, a therapist about to begin doctoral studies, and their two 
young sons, Antonio and Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
But a major West Coast university (Baca said he can't name it as the award 
hasn't yet been officially announced) will lure him to its campus next fall for 
a monthlong guest lectureship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Attended School 
</P>
<P>
The poet, who never attended school in his life and received his high school 
diploma by taking the GED exam, is not even sure what will be required of him, 
but he knows the job pays extremely well. "I don't know what you do," he 
wondered aloud during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "You just stand there and 
make money." 
</P>
<P>
He had come here to talk with directors at the Los Angeles Theatre Center about 
the possibility of having one of his plays produced. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'm going to do a play for these people," he said, sitting in one of 
the center's offices, smoking a cigarette. "We'll see if they can meet my 
criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Though the words were direct and tinged with challenge, Baca is hardly the 
tough homeboy you might expect from hearing his life story. At 37, he looks 
healthy and fit, the scars from his prison life invisible to the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
More handsome than his photographs, he is dressed colorfully this day, in a 
raspberry cotton shirt, blue pants and blue and white Mexican wool vest. But 
even more striking is his manner. Baca radiates a gentleness, serenity, and 
lack of anger. 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't have time to be angry," he explained. "If you compare a life 
to daytime photography, my life has been more like nighttime photography. My 
life as a background has had darkness; the only way to survive the darkness is 
to have my soul flash. I'm too busy trying to capture the aspects of myself in 
the dark." 
</P>
<P>
By discovering language and capturing himself through it, Baca claimed, he 
totally transformed his life: 
</P>
<P>
". . . (In prison), I saw all these Chicanos going out to the fields and being 
treated like animals. I was tired of being treated like an animal. I wanted to 
learn how to read and to write and to understand. . . . I wanted to know how to 
function in this world. Why was I so ignorant and deprived? 
</P>
<P>
"The only way of transcending was through language and understanding. Had I not 
found the language, I would have been a guerrilla in the mountains. It was 
language that saved my (posterior). I really didn't know who I was before I was 
in prison." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Perceptions 
</P>
<P>
While there, at Arizona State Prison in Florence, Baca said he began to work on 
new perceptions, "birthing a way out through the poetry. I began to decompose 
the walls. I saw the walls were not the enemy. The enemy was myself." 
</P>
<P>
But why did the enemy repeatedly choose punishment rather than perform the 
required prison work? Even now, Baca sees his refusal to work as a creative, 
positive act. 
</P>
<P>
He maintains that he never committed the crime for which he was convicted. He 
had gone to visit a friend, he said, and wound up in the midst of a shoot-out 
in which an FBI agent was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got caught in a situation we should never have been in," he said. "I 
got caught in a net. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But he gives himself credit for being "that one Chicano who said, 'This 
(treatment) is legally and morally wrong. I do not want to lift this arm to 
work.' That's a creative act. My whole life has been based on creating my own 
code of right and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Bitter Today 
</P>
<P>
Though he suffered as a result, Baca does not appear embittered. He speaks 
evenly of the fact that his incorrigibility resulted in the warden standing in 
his cell and tearing up his poems. (Baca responded by throwing a chair at him.) 
In addition, Baca said he received electric shock treatments in what he calls 
an attempt to coerce him into uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
To a degree, they worked. "I forgot how to pronounce my own name," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But as a child, he had been trained by curanderas (Mexican folk healers) in 
herbalogy and folk religion. And he had learned to expect, even treasure, such 
suffering. "At a very young age, I became a young Chicano with a sense of 
destiny," Baca said. "I had the idea I was intended for an incredible amount of 
suffering. I was taught that suffering would be our gift and we had to build 
from it and not let it destroy us." 
</P>
<P>
And so slowly, patiently, Baca endured, writing to retain his sanity. When he 
had composed a few poems, an inmate friend suggested he send them to Mother 
Jones magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a wild chance and sent Mother Jones three poems. I didn't know how to 
put the stamp on the envelope and address it. A couple of weeks later, I got 
$300 (for the three poems) in the mail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Help From Famous Poet 
</P>
<P>
Denise Levertov, who describes Baca as "an extraordinarily gifted poet," was 
the magazine's poetry editor at the time. An internationally known poet and 
professor of English at Stanford University, she began corresponding with him, 
ran his work in Mother Jones and found him a publisher for his first book, 
"Immigrants in Our Own Land" (Louisiana State University Press). 
</P>
<P>
Levertov wrote the introduction for "Martin &amp; Meditations on the South 
Valley" and in it she describes "Martin," the first of the book's two long 
poems, as "a Hero Tale, an archetypal journey." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how Baca's work has evolved, she replied: "When he was writing in prison, 
he had a sketchy idea of punctuation and sometimes his usage was incorrect, but 
it didn't take him very long to get past that stage." 
</P>
<P>
There was always the possibility, she admitted, that "he was someone with one 
theme and that once he was free, he wouldn't continue. But that's obviously not 
the case. He's a naturally gifted poet. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Levertov also noted that "Martin" was published by New Directions, "a very, 
very fine publisher that's published most of the major poets over this 
century." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now He Has Attention 
</P>
<P>
Gary Soto, one of the world's best-known Chicano poets and an associate 
professor of English at UC Berkeley, has similarly followed Baca's work for 
more than a decade and suspects that publication by such a respected publisher 
helped bring the world to Baca's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy's always been a strong writer, he just never got the attention," Soto 
observed. "It's very pure, innocent, but not naive writing. He's writing about 
his life. . . . He's never been a careerist like so many other poets, with one 
eye on the publishing world and one eye on his subject. Jimmy has both eyes on 
his subject." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Soto was familiar with Baca's work, he was somewhat shocked when 
the two met at the American Bookseller's Assn. meeting last year in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in cutoff pants," Soto remembered. "Everyone else was dressed up and 
suave. He didn't look like the cholo, the tough guy who comes up in his poems. 
He just looked like a guy happy to be there. . . . He has such character about 
him. It's very genuine. . . . When I read his poems, I think, 'This is what 
literature is about.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appreciates Advice 
</P>
<P>
While Baca clearly appreciates such comments, especially from distinguished 
friends in high places, he does not appear to need them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been hailed by some of the most severe critics in the country. It 
doesn't mean anything," he insisted. "I just try to stay within the rules of 
the earth, within the boundaries of dignity. I don't do anything for money. . . 
. I live on a day-to-day basis. . . . In prison. I didn't know if I was going 
to be alive from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, daily existence involves considerable traveling. For the last 
three and a half months, Baca's been on tour, reading his poems at universities 
and major poetry centers, with as many side trips to reform schools and his 
farm in Albuquerque as he can squeeze in along the way. 
</P>
<P>
According to Manazar Gamboa, a Santa Monica poet who works with incarcerated 
youths throughout Los Angeles County, Baca visited three centers for juvenile 
offenders in the Los Angeles area during another recent visit here. 
</P>
<P>
"They received him really well, especially at San Fernando Juvenile Hall," 
Gamboa said. "Compared to other places, it's pretty hard-core there. Some of 
the kids are facing very hard time. Without preaching, he stressed the value of 
learning. And when he finished his discussion with the kids, one of them said: 
'Can we have one of your books?' He wrote in it and dedicated it to them and 
gave it to them. I could see he was really moved on an emotional level." 
</P>
<P>
But whatever his schedule, he said he finds time to write on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roamed 10 Years 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't always so. After he left prison, he gave up writing and roamed the 
country for about 10 years. "I never fully accepted the fact that I was a 
writer until a year and a half ago (with the publication of 'Martin')," he 
said. "As many times as I chose the gift, I chose the curse. The trouble with 
scoffing at human life with indifference is that it's terribly numbing." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, it appears Baca writes to stay fully alive. 
</P>
<P>
"My work is the only thing I've ever had that I could hold onto. . . . I have 
to deal with changing diapers, washing dishes, changing doorknobs. I don't 
believe this (excrement) about 'I'm an artist, give me a little cottage at the 
beach and I'll write,' " he said. "It all comes down to my act of sitting down 
in my little room and writing what's in my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, that's been novels. Though a new book of poems is due out this fall, 
"The Black Mesa Poems," Baca more recently completed the first novel in a 
trilogy about his life. "In the Way of the Sun" covers his early orphanage 
years, and once again, he offers an unexpected view. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible paradise of sorts," he said of his orphanage experience. 
"For a child who's isolated and only hears the sound of horses and cows and 
church bells ringing, it was an incredibly exhilarating playground. . . . Can 
you imagine the shoe room, with 70,000 pairs of shoes and you find one that 
fits and then try to find its mate?" 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Jimmy Santiago Baca was a kid again, back in his marble shooting 
days, bartering Fizzies for marbles and marbles for firecrackers and 
firecrackers for chocolate. He remembered how he and his friends plotted ways 
to steal the glass eye of a man who visited the orphanage. They wanted to use 
the guy's eye to win an upcoming marble tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As Baca's dark eyes widened, he flashed to the simple, childhood logic behind 
the quest for the glass eye: "We thought it could see!"

THE END OF A BATTLE ROYAL 
</P>

<P>
A 2 1/2-year-old girl has won the right to the first name Princess after a 
battle royal between her parents and officials from Buckingham Palace and the 
Scottish bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Dulcima Rosetta Manwaring-Spencer claims no royal connections but her 
parents liked the name and never imagined they would run into problems with the 
Royal Family and the government. 
</P>
<P>
But Audrey and Hugh Manwaring-Spencer emerged triumphant when Scotland's 
registrar general of births, deaths and marriages recently backed down and 
decided there was no authority banning names such as Princess. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very pleased that it's finally been resolved and they can finally call 
their little girl Princess," said Martin Johnson, a family spokesman. "They 
always assumed common sense would prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Princess and her parents remained unavailable for comment to the non-paying 
media. They were on their farm on the Isle of Skye off Scotland's west coast, 
which is better known for its rugged beauty than its courtly graces. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the girl was born on July 5, 1986, the registry clerk on the Isle 
of Skye duly recorded Princess Dulcima Rosetta on her birth certificate and she 
was baptized with those names. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply liked the name," Mrs. Manwaring-Spencer said last year when the 
battles began. "Every family argues over what to call their children. We liked 
Princess." 
</P>
<P>
The birth certificate was sent to the registrar general in Edinburgh, which 
replied five months later saying the name was unacceptable because its use was 
part of the "Crown's royal prerogative." Officials demanded that the 
Manwaring-Spencers, tenant farmers with four children, hand over their copy of 
the certificate. 
</P>
<P>
They took up the challenge and wrote to Queen Elizabeth II. In December 1987, 
royal aide Robert Fellowes wrote back: "You may rest assured that you have 
caused no offense to the queen and you may continue to use the word as your 
daughter's Christian name." 
</P>
<P>
But three weeks later, Fellowes wrote again to inform the Manwaring-Spencers 
that the 1965 Scottish birth registration law ruled out the name Princess. 
</P>
<P>
They continued their battle and last week, after an investigation by the 
registrar general, the Manwaring-Spencers were informed that the name Princess 
could remain on the registry of births, said a Scottish Office spokesman.

THE BISHOP OF CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
BARBARA HARRIS, WHOSE NEW ROLE SHATTERS TRADITION, TRIES A TOUCH OF DIPLOMACY 
ON HER DIVIDED CHURCH 
</P>

<P>
The cameras clicked furiously as the twig-thin woman in a long, black fur 
stepped toward her stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to think bishops live like this," Barbara Harris said with 
a laugh, making fun of herself in a way that only supremely self-assured people 
do. "This is special." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was. Harris, a 58-year-old divorced black woman and civil rights 
activist, was launching a new life as the first female bishop of the Episcopal 
Church, often jokingly referred to in the United States as "the Republican 
Party at pray." 
</P>
<P>
And already, Harris -- the first woman to don the bishop's miter in any branch 
of Christianity, which believes in the 2,000-year succession of bishops dating 
to Jesus' 12 male apostles -- has put in a schedule so heavy it has 
necessitated the presence of a limousine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Busy First Day 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday alone, her official first day as bishop, she: presided at two 
services, one lasting more than two hours; attended two church receptions; 
visited homeless pregnant women; and finally was caught squeezing in a smoke 
while being interviewed quickly by Ebony magazine. 
</P>
<P>
During the busy day, she also revealed herself to be flashy, funny, warm and 
something new -- diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying her staff and dressed in the purple bishop's shirt, a blue suede suit, 
high heels, gold earrings and manicured mauve nails, Harris cracked jokes and 
poked fun at herself several times, as when she performed one service ritual 
out of order. With great patience, she also posed for pictures, autographed 
church programs, dispensed hugs and remembered names. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you kneel! Don't you dare!" she barked to an older woman, who, instead, 
placed a cross on Harris' forehead. A little boy gave her a drawing of a cross 
and a miter. "Oh, you're good!" Harris said. When a man she knew asked to kiss 
her ring, Harris responded: "Forget the ring, sweetie. Kiss the bishop!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Good Behavior 
</P>
<P>
Since her election, Harris has seemed to be on notably good behavior, her 
utterances toned down since the days when she railed against conservative 
elements in the church, calling them "Podunk Episcopalians" who were afraid of 
"mitered mamas." 
</P>
<P>
She now promises not to serve as "a gadfly" for liberal causes but to be a 
bishop of all the people. Finding her public self is proving to be her latest 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"To be thrust into the limelight is almost disorienting," said the Rev. Paul 
Washington, the North Philadelphia cleric whom Harris calls her mentor. "She 
has been struggling to remain herself and not become something that people 
perceive her to be. She has had to fight not to allow herself to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, hoarse and coughing from a cold, offered her usual support for the 
disadvantaged but couched it in more palatable language, devoid of 
name-calling, when delivering her first sermon as a bishop over the weekend at 
the Cathedral Church of St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a world that oppresses and dehumanizes," she told the packed house 
of supporters. "There are times when we are disheartened and discouraged. We 
avoid the responsibility for becoming involved." 
</P>
<P>
But then, in a jovial tone that brought laughter, she added: "We rationalize 
there is no harm in walking with the devil as long as he is going your way." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing in a more serious tone, she said it is easy not to confront teen-age 
pregnancy, prejudice, the rampage of drugs, the plague of AIDS and corruption 
in government and in the church hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"The temptation we have," she said, "is to play it safe, don't make waves. 
</P>
<P>
"But if Jesus had played it safe, we would not be saved. If the Diocese of 
Massachusetts had played it safe, I would not be standing here clothed in 
rochet and chimere and wearing a pectoral cross." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Woman of Controversy 
</P>
<P>
That was as close as she came to swiping at her critics, who would have had a 
tough time considering any woman as a bishop, let alone as controversial a 
personality as Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Harris is believed to be the first divorced person to be consecrated, although 
other priests have ended their marriages after becoming bishops. Her marriage 
to Raymond Rollins ended in 1963 after three years. They had no children. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what her biggest disappointment in life has been, her mentor Washington 
replied: "I think she would have wanted to be married. However, I look at many 
women and I realize with their amount of energy and the concerns they have 
beyond themselves, they may never be able to find a mate who will give them the 
liberty to do what God made them to do." 
</P>
<P>
Of Harris, he noted: "She's always been interested in something 'out there.' To 
take that away would be to destroy Barbara Harris. It's a sacrifice Barbara 
Harris was not ready to make." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longtime Activist 
</P>
<P>
Harris has theorized that some of the disapproval she has encountered has come 
not only because she is female but because she is black. She is an outspoken 
advocate for civil rights causes. She has marched in Selma, registered voters 
in Mississippi and spoken out forcefully against apartheid in South Africa. She 
has said that the two most important influences on her life were the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Much of her experience as a priest and layperson was acquired working with 
Washington at the Church of the Advocate, the North Philadelphia Gothic 
cathedral that nurtured the Black Panthers, hosting their convention in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also has ruffled feathers by expressing support for the ordination of 
homosexuals and other gay causes. 
</P>
<P>
While tempering her political language, Harris has said that she does not think 
her positions are at odds with the church. "I feel that I am an open person, 
politically, socially, and involve myself with issues and causes that are 
consistent with the church." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Barred From Men's Route 
</P>
<P>
Like almost all women pioneers, Harris also has endured the criticism that she 
does not have the usual credentials and experience of her male colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
But this view overlooks that women like Harris cannot follow the same paths men 
take to top jobs because those routes are not always open to women. In Harris' 
case, for example, the church did not even ordain females as priests until 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Harris did not graduate from college but was a public relations executive in 
her native Philadelphia for Joseph Baker Associates and the Sun Oil Co. from 
1958 until 1980, when she quit to become a priest. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of seminary training, she took correspondence courses from Philadelphia 
area colleges and the Urban Theology Unit in Sheffield, England. 
</P>
<P>
Although she spent her early adult life flying around the country on public 
relations business, church activities always were a priority for her from her 
childhood in a lower-middle-class neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"She worked for a living, but she lived for the church," Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Childhood in the Church 
</P>
<P>
Like her mother, Beatrice, Harris sang in church choirs and taught in church 
schools at St. Barnabus in Philadelphia. When 11 women were ordained in an 
unsanctioned ceremony at Church of Advocate in 1974, Harris flew in from a Los 
Angeles business assignment to lead the procession in the church, carrying the 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
She grew interested in the priesthood while making prison visits to a man she 
knew who had been convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was ordained in 1980 and four years later became executive director of 
the Episcopal Church Publishing Co., an umbrella group that publishes the 
Witness, a church journal. 
</P>
<P>
Her flamboyant writings in the Witness, where she outlined her views on social 
issues, made her politics well-known and branded her as controversial long 
before her election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 'Troublemaker' 
</P>
<P>
To those who decry Harris' rise, all of this is used as ammunition to label her 
a troublemaker. But Washington says, "Anybody who is interested in change is 
considered a troublemaker to those who do not want change." 
</P>
<P>
Since her election last September, Harris has received death threats and caused 
some church members to echo the sentiments of Dean Elton Smith of Buffalo, who 
told a reporter that even though he supported her election, "I wish somebody 
else had been elected to be the first woman bishop." 
</P>
<P>
But somebody else is not what they got. With a scant majority of 61 of 118 
worldwide standing committees voting in her favor, in what is usually a 
perfunctory endorsement, Harris became a woman of history. Her supporters saw 
the unlikely event as nothing less than the work of God. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think God is not in this, then God is not in this world," said the Rev. 
Leroy Attles, a Boston pastor who preached at a service Harris attended Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Desire to Grow 
</P>
<P>
Washington says he would not use the word ambitious to describe Harris, "but I 
believe she felt she must always grow and reach a level beyond where she may be 
at a current moment. She's not trying to get ahead or be out front. But she has 
tremendous self-confidence to tackle any kind of job." 
</P>
<P>
When Harris first told Washington she felt a calling to the priesthood, he told 
her to give some thought to why she needed to be ordained. She pondered the 
question a full year. 
</P>
<P>
Harris herself had held doubts about women becoming priests, but her thinking 
evolved and finally changed. 
</P>
<P>
"When people ask her that question," said Jim Solheim, spokesman for the 
Episcopal Diocese in Massachusetts, "she smiles and says, 'I saw the light.' "

MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS TOUCHES DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At times, it seemed that officials from the Ministry of Earnest Questions were 
there just to ask a trio from the Ministry of Silly Walks the difference 
between British and American humor. 
</P>
<P>
But Eric Idle quickly put things in perspective. "American humor pays more," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
So things went here at a Museum of Broadcasting seminar that launched a 
20th-anniversary celebration and display of the works of Monty Python's Flying 
Circus. This look back in humor is to run through Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
The Circus, of course, is that free-wheeling British troupe that began on the 
BBC in 1969. Its varied forms of stiff-upper-lip silliness, such as exploding 
humans to show the population explosion, remain legend. 
</P>
<P>
Before calling it quits in 1974, the troupe made 45 acclaimed half-hour 
episodes, the last batch of six without tall, loose-limped John Cleese, the 
star of the celebrated Ministry of Silly Walks skits. 
</P>
<P>
The year they ceased fire, their series started on U.S. public TV, at first in 
Dallas, in those days much more hip than New York. Then the show spread 
throughout America. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Python graduates Idle, Terry Jones and the American member, Terry 
Gilliam, were on the museum's Python panel. Alas, their colleagues -- Cleese, 
Graham Chapman and Michael Palin -- had previous commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was most enlightening as an overflow crowd explored the history and 
ramifications of Python humor, and sometimes got a straight answer. 
</P>
<P>
The mostly young Pythonologists, one of whom said he was doing his master's 
thesis on the group, showed a detailed knowledge of their subject that rivaled 
a convention of Star Trekkies, posing such questions as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "When did you conceive of the dead parrot sketch and were there complaints 
from animal activists?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- "How did the effeminate drill team sketch come about?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Why did you dress up like women, and was it a secret fantasy?" 
</P>
<P>
How fragile TV tapings can be was indicated when Jones was asked about a sort 
of deranged British "You Are There" history special he and Palin did in 1969. 
It was called "The Complete and Utter History of Britain." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't exist," he said, somewhat wistfully. "It's been wiped." 
</P>
<P>
The museum's Python retrospective includes examples of their series, plus what 
its members did, solo and together, before and immediately after disbanding. 
</P>
<P>
How difficult post-Python life can be was indicated by Gilliam, the series' 
surreal, black-humor illustrator, when asked about his surreal, controversial 
movie "Brazil," over which he did much-publicized battle with Universal Studios 
several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, "you win the battle and they win the war." His new 
movie, "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," due to receive its U.S. premiere 
in San Francisco on March 8, promises to be just as divisive among audiences. 
It is already shaping up to be Columbia Pictures' most difficult marketing task 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gilliam and the others, Idle, who contributed the leering "wink-wink, 
nudge-nudge" to the Circus, thence to America, has not been idle since the 
Pythons irrevocably uncoiled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Idle achieved a measure of cult fame with "The Rutles," which NBC 
aired. It traced, with satire aforethought, the rise of "The Rutles," a British 
rock group that some thought vaguely resembled the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
The late John Lennon loved the show, Idle said, but the Beatle Paul McCartney, 
well . . . Idle's mobile face became deadpan. "Paul didn't like it. Word 
filtered back."

Idle spent last year gadding about the world, playing the valet role to Pierce 
Brosnan in a TV remake of "Around the World in 80 Days," scheduled to air on 
NBC this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Python persiflage resulted in frequent laughter and, at one point, the 
trio got a present from a young fan, a brown, furry mechanical cat's paw. At 
least the paw looked fake. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the trio, minus their paw, were feted at a place where rock stars 
and other swells congregate, the Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The list of invited guests included billionaire publisher Malcolm Forbes, 
model-actress Lauren Hutton, actor Val Kilmer, and a delegate simply known as 
Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
Before all that, Jones reflected at the museum on how the video fates and 
America had so well treated a bunch of satirically minded college lads who 
called themselves Monty Python's Flying Circus. 
</P>
<P>
He said he never thought the troupe had made shows that would last. Idle 
agreed. "The only thing we ever agreed on as a group," he said, "was that the 
show would never go in America.'

FORESTER SISTERS BRING FAMILY HARMONY TO STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It is hard to figure: While so many of us north of the Mason-Dixon line grew up 
breaking our siblings' toys, fighting for the drumsticks at the dinner table 
and spurning anything our parents might conceivably enjoy, why have so many 
Southern families found harmony together, in the most literal sense of the 
word? 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the tradition of family harmony singing that runs from the 
Carter Family up through the Judds has been a blessing for music fans. As 
perhaps best exemplified by the Everly Brothers, common genes seem to make for 
heavenly vocal harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
The Forester Sisters' performance at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana 
on Monday did nothing to dispel that notion. The quartet, based in Lookout 
Mountain, Ga., delivered a 19-song set of four-part harmonies that were both 
homespun and close-knit. 
</P>
<P>
Though the two blond sisters, Kathy and Kim, handled the bulk of the lead 
vocals, the Foresters present themselves as a homogeneous package. One has to 
squint to find the individual sisters' names listed on their albums, and while 
their excellent six-piece backup band was introduced in detail, the sisters, 
who also shared between-song announcing duties, never identified themselves on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
That united front seems to work for the band: "We don't know who's who," said 
Scott Sagum, who drove from Valencia with his wife to see the show, "but we 
sure know all their songs." And, fittingly, the set's strongest songs were 
those that showcased the group harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Along with a faithful version of the McGuire Sisters 1955 hit "Sincerely," rich 
harmony interplay prevailed on "Lyin' in His Arms Again," "Boogie-Woogie Bugle 
Boy," the Beatles' "I've Just Seen a Face," and the Western swing-inflected 
"You Can't Have a Good Time Without Me," one of two new songs introduced in the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kathy nor Kim has a voice that comes close to catching the ache and 
feeling Wynonna Judd sends soaring over her mother's harmonies, but judged by 
less stellar standards, each has a fine country voice. 
</P>
<P>
Singer/guitarist Kim, particularly, lent persuasive vocals to Foster and 
Lloyd's "Leave It Alone" -- which also boasted some hot fiddle breaks from 
multi-instrumentalist Jimmy Mattingly -- "Letter Home" and the up-tempo yet 
melancholy "You Love Me."

ARTIST LOSES ZEST IN CAREFUL EXPLORATION OF NEW STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artists' personal journeys may sometimes involve visits to the sunny vacation 
spots of a career -- praise from colleagues, good reviews, museum shows. Other 
trips are to the dank and dispiriting places where things just don't work out. 
And sometimes artists are busy shuttling from one style to another before 
settling down or packing their bags again. 
</P>
<P>
Clark Walding's most recent paintings, on view through March 3 at Saddleback 
College Art Gallery, look like work-in-transit, exploring a new style but in a 
bland, careful way that expresses very little. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Walding's "Heartland" series showed him to be a sturdy 
Neo-Expressionist painter, wielding a loose, broad brush on expansive canvases. 
Although his figures were weak -- generalized in ways perilously close to 
commercial art -- his landscapes were lush and juicy. In his best canvases, he 
went a step further, juxtaposing slices of different landscapes (or, 
occasionally, interior views) as if jump-cutting between different states of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has produced another painting series, "Show of Hands," which 
sounds somewhat gimmicky -- big images of the artist's hand are superimposed 
over landscape views -- but which may have been more impressive in person. (I 
haven't seen the series.) In any case, the figure was beating a quick retreat 
in Walding's work. 
</P>
<P>
The new works continue the drift away from the figure in an even more decisive 
way. In fact, they don't seem to have much to do with landscape, either. That 
is not necessarily a bad thing. But in redirecting his approach, Walding is 
turning his back on his chief strength. The works that make up "Crossing the 
Void" are fussy decorative objects first, paintings second and that is their 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"Promise," for example, consists of an assembly of vertical elements -- a 
wooden slat wrapped with crinkled lead spritzed with metallic paint; a canvas 
brushed with three large, vaguely calligraphic motifs; another meandering 
abstract canvas garnished with more lead -- all mounted on a wooden structure 
stuffed with barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
There is too much going on here, and also not enough. Some sense of an Asian 
sensibility comes through -- via the "calligraphy" and the folding-screen 
allusion made by the separate components -- but it just doesn't add up to a 
unified vision. Great pains appear to have been taken to create a medley of 
textures and colors and shapes, but it doesn't have anything intelligent to say 
for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Walding's recent pieces incorporate lead, a material that has appealed 
to a number of European artists in recent years because of its basic, elemental 
nature and its cold, "anti-art" qualities of heaviness and dullness. In 
contrast, Walding's use of lead seems trivial. 
</P>
<P>
The lower portion of his painting, "Handmade Promise," is cut neatly away to 
accommodate a rectangular lead bar. The painting, in brushy ocher, blue and 
gray, is of a generalized landscape containing a large form with an arched top 
(a ceremonial marker?). The lead piece may have been meant to carry a symbolic 
meaning of some kind, but it has no magical powers at all. It's just a 
well-mannered hunk of metal sitting in a nicely crafted wooden holder. As in 
the other works on view, there is too much bland tastefulness here and not 
enough vision or guts or risk. 
</P>
<P>
A hint of Walding's lyrical earlier style remains in "Hidden Among the Leaves" 
-- a passage that runs down the right-hand side of the painting. A white shade 
has risen to half-mast in a window, revealing a shimmering, indecipherable 
image, as if firecrackers are exploding inside. Below, a series of gradually 
widening horizontal stripes (wood siding on a house?) is interrupted by a 
painterly brown plank like a diving board viewed from above (maybe a piece of 
lumber leaning against the wall?). 
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't you know it. This fragment -- with its combination of recognizable 
everyday forms and its slight whiff of mystery -- contains more imaginative 
zest than Walding musters in all the other works put together. It looks like 
time to get back on the boat and sojourn for a while in some other port of call 
-- or maybe even consider a voyage back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossing the Void," works by Clark Walding, remains on view at Saddleback 
College Art Gallery, 28000 Marguerite Parkway in Mission Viejo, through March 
3. Gallery hours are 1 to 5 p.m. Tuesday, Thursday and Friday; noon to 8 p.m. 
Wednesday. Admission is free. Information: (714) 582-4924.

2 HIGH SCHOOLS BAR STUDENTS' AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials at two south Orange County high schools, Dana Hills and Capistrano 
Valley, have refused to allow students to form on-campus chapters of Amnesty 
International, the Nobel-prize-winning human rights organization, because it 
does not fit into the school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Although more than 1,000 public schools nationwide have formed Amnesty 
International chapters, including seven in Orange County, officials at the two 
south county schools said they do not open campus facilities to non-academic 
groups during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
The district adopted its current policy 5 years ago after a number of religious 
groups started meeting during class hours, said trustee Ted Kopp of the 
Capistrano Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Have to Draw the Line' 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically to meet the law, to separate church and state, if you will," 
Kopp said. "We have to draw the line somewhere. Our policy is that any group 
can use the campus before and after school." 
</P>
<P>
However, the student organizers feel that Amnesty International relates to 
their curriculum and that they should be allowed to meet during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel this group is very educational and is creating great public awareness, 
and we think we should be allowed," said Natalie Pierce, 18, a senior at 
Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, who requested a campus chapter 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce and fellow organizer Chris Bergerud, 17, a Dana Hills senior, have 
appealed the decisions of their principals to the Capistrano Unified School 
District's board of trustees, which is scheduled to consider the matter at a 
March 6 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of students are expected to turn out, as well as sympathetic adult 
leaders of Amnesty International and members of the American Civil Liberties 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think they (school officials) need to understand more exactly what 
Amnesty is all about," said Bergerud. "It is impartial and an apolitical 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International works to free prisoners of conscience and upgrade their 
treatment while in custody in such Third World countries as Turkey, Pakistan 
and Chile, Amnesty regional director David Hinkley said Tuesday. He added that 
it has a worldwide membership of 700,000 people, including about 300,000 in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the organization was formed in 1961, student interest in it took off 
just 2 years ago after an Amnesty-sponsored "Conspiracy of Hope" rock concert 
tour which featured such popular entertainers as U2, Sting and Peter Gabriel. 
Last year's Amnesty-sponsored "Human Rights Now!" rock tour was headlined by 
Bruce Springsteen. 
</P>
<P>
Bergerud and Pierce already have formed off-campus Amnesty chapters. Fifty-six 
students are members of the Dana Hills High School chapter, and there are 65 
members in the Capistrano Valley High School chapter, the students said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone has feelings pro or con on an official basis about 
Amnesty International, but it's just that from a legal standpoint, we could not 
do it," Dana Hills Principal John Smart said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smart added that the school district has also banned student chapters of such 
civic clubs as Kiwanis and Rotary because they are not part of the curriculum. 
A spokesman for Capistrano Valley High School could not be reached Tuesday for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
But Bergerud and Pierce have argued that Amnesty should be part of school life 
because the California Board of Education requires human rights education by 
high schools. Amnesty, Bergerud added, teaches students to respect human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Amnesty International . . . is simply not a radical, partisan or biased 
organization," Bergerud, who is also editor of his campus newspaper, said in a 
recent editorial column. "AI members are proud to be fighting for the basic 
rights of others and know they have the right to meet on campus during school 
with the full cooperation of the school and board of trustees." 
</P>
<P>
While student Amnesty members are not allowed to "adopt" prisoners, as their 
adult counterparts do, they are encouraged to write letters on behalf of the 
prisoners to leaders of foreign governments and to participate in public 
education programs about the program. 
</P>
<P>
Formation of Amnesty campus chapters has met little resistance nationwide, 
Amnesty director Hinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
In the western United States, Hinkley said, he knows of only two other 
instances -- at a high school in Van Nuys and at a middle school in Oregon -- 
that school officials have tried to block new chapters. The Van Nuys high 
school recently acquiesced in the face of heavy publicity, and the Oregon 
middle school case is currently being pressed. 
</P>
<P>
Bergerud said he was initially attracted to Amnesty last year because it 
offered him and his fellow students an opportunity to help others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Honestly Helping People' 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the few things that someone my age can do that can honestly make a 
difference," Bergerud said Tuesday. "You're honestly helping people on the 
other side of the world. I have seen what a difference a letter can make." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said she was drawn to the organization because she considered it 
educational. 
</P>
<P>
Although high school students can form Amnesty chapters off campus, Bergerud 
said he asked to form one on campus so that members could meet more 
conveniently and so that meeting times and announcements could be posted on the 
school bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
But school trustee Kopp said the group could meet on campus half an hour before 
class or half an hour afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, lunch period is the only time during the (school) day they could 
meet," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
Bergerud, however, said it is difficult to get students together during 
off-school hours. 
</P>
<P>
After running into roadblocks from the school district, Bergerud and Pierce 
contacted Amnesty officials in Orange County for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a big issue at stake," said Joan Marcus-Colvin, Amnesty 
membership coordinator for Orange County. "We now have young people who are 
committed and educated to human rights work, and having a school district that 
is disallowing this kind of activity is a detriment to our youth."

CENSUS BUREAU SEEKS ACCORD WITH MINORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials and community leaders met with a U.S. Census Bureau 
representative Tuesday to get ideas for reaching out to minority communities to 
ensure a more accurate count in the 1990 census, especially among Latino and 
Asian residents. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the U.S. Census Bureau, made the one-day 
visit at the request of Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido, who said 
the city's population has changed since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido said Santa Ana's 1980 census figure of 225,000 is believed to be about 
50,000 to 75,000 short of the city's actual population. Although there is no 
official evidence supporting this view, Pulido said the estimates have come 
mostly through police observations. 
</P>
<P>
Census figures are used in determining federal and state funding and the number 
of legislative representatives. According to Pulido, an additional 50,000 
people in the 1990 census could mean an increase of as much as $5 million 
annually in revenues for the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Jill Arthur, a legislative aide for the city, said many people, especially 
illegal aliens, are afraid to fill out the census questionnaire, fearing 
trouble with other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Through census fairs and public service announcements, Arthur said, the city 
wants to teach the growing Latino and Asian communities the benefits of an 
accurate census and to assure people that any information given to the Census 
Bureau is confidential.

FIRE-DAMAGED SCHOOL FUNCTIONING WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the loss of about one-fourth of its classrooms due to fire, Richman 
Elementary School in Fullerton functioned "almost normally and with no 
problems," Principal Minard Duncan reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Only 40 of the school's 760 students had to be bused to another school, Duncan 
said. "We shifted around classroom space to take care of the other 720," he 
said. The 40 that were bused are preschool, Headstart students who were taken 
to Maple Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Richman Elementary lost six of its 25 regular classrooms early Monday morning 
in a raging fire that caused damages estimated at $500,000. The cause of the 
blaze is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, several school officials said they had been told that arson is 
suspected. But a spokeswoman for the Fullerton Fire Department said Tuesday 
that nothing definite has been found to point to arson. 
</P>
<P>
"Marc Martin, the city's fire marshal, has said that arson has not been ruled 
out, but there is so far no evidence to support arson as the cause of the 
school fire," said Sylvia Palmer, city public information officer.

UCI STUDENTS SIGN UP TO HELP THOSE IN NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scores of students at UC Irvine signed up Tuesday to help causes such as food 
banks, crime victim support and refugee assistance at the second annual Have a 
Heart Volunteerism Fair. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the fair was to get students "into the community, doing actual 
volunteer service work," assistant fair coordinator Steven K. Tajiri said. The 
fair was planned for Valentine's Day, he said, because "it's the time of year 
that people are thinking about other people." 
</P>
<P>
Biology student Grace N. Hussain, 20, who signed up with the Central Orange 
County Literacy Council of Costa Mesa, admitted she previously did volunteer 
work to "look good and put it on a resume." 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, she said, she signed up to help people learn to read. She 
disagreed with students who said they were too busy to help. 
</P>
<P>
"You always have time if you try and make it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer coordinator Laura Monks of Volunteer Center, Orange 
County-Central/South, said the group received 10 applications from students. 
The center provides volunteers to more than 600 nonprofit groups in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
However, John Ngo of the Orange County Refugee Community Resources Opportunity 
Project Inc. of Santa Ana said he was disappointed that only half a dozen 
students inquired about his group. He said that at least "the weather is 
perfect. It's like compensation."

WITNESS TELLS OF BRIDGE GAME WITH KRAFT ON NIGHT OF 2 SLAYINGS

Randy Steven Kraft was playing bridge with friends the night that two men he is 
accused of killing were last seen alive near Cypress College, a defense witness 
testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County prosecutors, who have charged Kraft with 16 murders, view 
that bridge game in 1983 as highly beneficial to their own case.

Several defense witnesses at Kraft's trial in Orange County Superior Court have 
testified about his activities the weekend that two men, Geoffrey Alan Nelson 
and Rodger James DeVaul, died. The attorneys contend that Kraft did not have 
time to kill them, dump their bodies 48 miles apart, and still be at places 
where witnesses saw him. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 18, and DeVaul, 20, were last seen at about 1:30 a.m. on Saturday 
morning, Feb. 12, 1983. Nelson's body was found at 5:30 a.m. that morning along 
the Euclid Street on-ramp to the Garden Grove Freeway in Garden Grove. DeVaul's 
body was found near Mt. Baldy in the Angeles National Forest the next day, 
Sunday, but evidence showed that he could have been dumped there as early as 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A co-worker of Kraft has placed him in Rolling Hills Estates, on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, at St. Ives Laboratories at 9 a.m. that Saturday. On Tuesday, 
Harry Eylar, a friend of Kraft, testified that on the Friday night before the 
victims were last seen, he was with Kraft at a poker and bridge party at a 
friend's house in Huntington Beach. Kraft played bridge, Eylar said, until the 
games broke up at almost midnight. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors were excited about Eylar's testimony for several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
One is that it places Kraft in Orange County the same night Nelson and DeVaul 
were last seen. It also leaves an hour and a half between the time he left the 
party and the time the victims disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
But also important to prosecutors was the revelation that the card party was in 
Huntington Beach. They have contended that an entry of "2 in 1 Beach" on a list 
found in Kraft's car stands for the Nelson and DeVaul killings. That is because 
what appeared to investigators as beach sand was found on DeVaul's body. 
</P>
<P>
But now prosecutors are wondering whether "2 in 1 Beach" refers to the fact 
that Kraft played cards in Huntington Beach the night that he found two men 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the list with 61 entries found in Kraft's car is his 
own score card of people he has killed. Kraft's attorneys argue that the list 
is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft attorney C. Thomas McDonald has also said he believes that the defense 
has shown that it was virtually impossible for Kraft to have killed Nelson and 
DeVaul. He would had to have done it all either between 1:30 a.m. and 5:20 a.m. 
-- evidence shows Nelson's body was dumped immediately before it was found -- 
or between 5:20 a.m. and 9 a.m., when he was at work at St. Ives. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that the time parameters set out by the defense's own 
witnesses show it was possible. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of DeVaul were found in Kraft's car and house. In several of them 
DeVaul is nude, and in others a mark is clearly shown on his neck. Pathologists 
say the neck mark is the result of pressure on the neck which killed him. Also, 
DeVaul is wearing Nelson's jacket in the pictures, which he had only borrowed 
for that night. 
</P>
<P>
Other defense witnesses Tuesday included two men who worked with Kraft at Lear 
Siegler Inc. in 1980, when another of the men Kraft is accused of killing was 
found. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Wyatt Loggins, 19, was last seen alive the night of Aug. 20, 1980, 
near the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Witness Ben Wroblewski said he had a business lunch with Kraft in San Diego on 
Saturday, Aug. 21, after they had worked together that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Did he appear to be preoccupied with anything?" asked Kraft attorney James G. 
Merwin. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Wroblewski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of sorts in any way?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Disheveled? Businesslike?" 
</P>
<P>
"Businesslike," Wroblewski answered. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of Loggins on a couch were found in Kraft's car and home. 
</P>
<P>
The Kraft trial, which began with jury selection last July, is now into the 
third week of the defense's testimony. Attorneys for Kraft, 43, so far have 
touched on just five of the 16 deaths with which he is charged.

JOHNSON, CITING DEMOCRATS' FLYER, WRITES TO ATTY. GEN.

<P>
Assembly Republican leader Ross Johnson of La Habra called Tuesday for Atty. 
Gen. John K. Van de Kamp to investigate Democratic voter registration efforts 
in Orange County, alleging that Assembly Democrats may have used taxpayers' 
money for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats immediately said that Johnson's accusation was based on an error in a 
brochure Orange County Democrats distributed last weekend at the state 
Democratic convention. 
</P>
<P>
The brochure was part of the effort by Orange County Democrats to persuade 
their colleagues to support a recall effort against Assemblyman Curt Pringle 
(R-Garden Grove), whose 1988 campaign included the use of 20 uniformed security 
guards hired to monitor polling places in heavily Latino areas of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson cited a section of the flyer that says Orange County Democrats "lobbied 
the Assembly Majority Services Office to implement an aggressive, paid, voter 
registration campaign in the 72nd Assembly District." The brochure said the 
registration effort began in March, 1988, and helped increase the Democrats' 
edge in the district. 
</P>
<P>
The office of Majority Services is part of the operation of Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). Because the office is operated with tax 
dollars, it is prohibited from engaging in political activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Brazen, Blatant' 
</P>
<P>
"If the facts in the brochure are true, this is the most brazen, blatant use of 
taxpayer money to run political campaigns I have ever seen," Johnson said in a 
statement released Tuesday by his office. 
</P>
<P>
Michael G. Balmages, chairman of the Orange County Democratic Central 
Committee, said the brochure was in error. Balmages said the county party's 
actual contact was with the Assembly Democratic Caucus and its privately funded 
campaign committee. The same account was given by Michael Galizio, Brown's 
chief of staff, and Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda), who oversaw the 
campaign of Pringle's Democratic opponent, Christian (Rick) Thierbach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a proofreading error," Balmages said. "Assembly Majority Services doesn't 
do this, and we didn't have any contact with them." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said he doubted the truth of the Democrats' assertion. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they made mistakes in the rest of the brochure," Johnson said. "Maybe 
they don't know what they're talking about. Maybe they're lying through their 
teeth now." 
</P>
<P>
A state Justice Department spokesman said the letter from Johnson requesting an 
investigation had not yet reached the desk of Deputy Atty. Gen. Nelson Kempsky, 
who will review it before forwarding it to Van de Kamp.

Narcotics investigators "gave the people of Los Angeles a big valentine by 
taking more than 900 pounds of cocaine off the streets of this city," Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by representatives from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. 
Customs Service and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Gates said 
detectives arrested five suspects and seized 976.8 pounds of cocaine at two 
locations in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Huntington Beach Police Department also assisted with the 
arrests, Gates said. The 1-kilogram packages of the drug, with a street value 
of $166.5 million, covered a desk and a table at the LAPD's Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on an anonymous tip, investigators set up surveillance at a home on 
Cerrillos Drive. Early Tuesday morning they followed a van from there to a 
shopping center at Topanga and Ventura boulevards, where the driver parked, 
Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives arrested the van's driver, Myron Keene, 47, of New York City and 
were given permission to search the van, the chief added. Officers recovered 
more than 961 pounds, from the van, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also seized another 7 kilos of cocaine from a vehicle parked in the 
5100 block of Llanos Drive and arrested Miguel A. Libutti, 42, an Argentine 
national, Adolfo Estrada, 32, Lorenia Valasqo , 19, and Nellie Alvarez, 46, all 
Colombian nationals, Gates said.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: LPGA NEEDS OUR COUNTY -- AND MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gene Wojciechowski 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How bad does the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. want to return to Orange 
County? Let them count the ways. 
</P>
<P>
"I can promise you that if it works," said LPGA vice president Jim Webb of a 
proposed tournament at Los Coyotes Country Club in Buena Park, "we will be 
screaming to high heaven." 
</P>
<P>
And . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We would love to have a tournament in Orange County," he said. "It's a major 
market, certainly a growing market. If we could be back there, that's where we 
would like to be." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, well, so much for subtleties. The LPGA adores Orange County, needs Orange 
County, the same way it needs any golf-rich population center. And in a crazy, 
wacky way, Orange County needs the LPGA back. 
</P>
<P>
Already, representatives of the LPGA have visited the Los Coyotes layout and, 
according to course owner Chuck McAuley, pronounced it fit and utterly 
charming. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought it was great," McAuley said. "They said the layout was as good or 
better than an updated The Players Championship course." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they did. They want a tournament here as bad, or worse, than McAuley 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes as expected, official confirmation of a deal could come as soon as 
next week, McAuley said. But this much is known: September is the likely month, 
a Japanese firm is the probable sponsor and Orange County is the happy 
beneficiary. After pursuing a tournament for almost the past eight months, 
McAuley couldn't be more pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County deserves a good tournament," he said, "And our people are very 
positive that they can really put on a good tournament." 
</P>
<P>
We've heard that before, haven't we? Three times the LPGA has placed the county 
on its schedule only to pull up its tees in three years or less. Count 'em: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It stayed a year at, of all the familiar places, Los Coyotes, before moving 
to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It made a three-year appearance at Mesa Verde Country Club in Costa Mesa, 
this time in the form of the Women's Kemper Open, before bidding a fond 
farewell after the 1981 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It returned to Mesa Verde as the Uniden Invitational in 1984 and stayed 
until 1986 before folding. Turns out Uniden had better things to do with the 
$600,000 or so -- minimum -- that it takes to sponsor a tournament of this 
sort. 
</P>
<P>
So what gives? Will a fourth LPGA try be the charm? 
</P>
<P>
Larry Igarashi thinks so. Or at least hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
Igarashi was the guy who produced the Uniden tournament. Golf is his business 
and Orange County is his home. He knows the market. 
</P>
<P>
He also knows a little something about the do's and don'ts of organizing an 
LPGA get-together. In his three years with the Uniden Invitational, Igarashi 
committed his share of blunders, but he also masterminded a few successes, as 
well. Like most everyone else, he is rooting hard for Los Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish them the very best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Igarashi can do better than that: He can provide the infant tournament 
with advice -- free of charge too. What a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight Lesson No. 1: Never allow the sponsor to think its considerable 
financial investment will mean considerable financial dividends. It won't. 
Trust Igarashi on this. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I can give them dollar for dollar value," Igarashi said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, just because you sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into a 
tournament, don't think you'll get it back right away. As Igarashi is kind 
enough to point out (much to the dismay of the LPGA), the association lags well 
behind the men's tour and the Senior tour in prize money, corporate 
sponsorship, major network television coverage and income from television 
rights. Add to that this persistent problem of star appeal. The PGA Tour has 
Greg Norman and Curtis Strange, to name two. The Seniors have legends, such as 
Gary Player, Chi Chi Rodriguez and, of course, Arnie. 
</P>
<P>
The LPGA has Nancy Lopez and, well . . . did we mention Nancy Lopez? 
</P>
<P>
Igarashi illustrates the situation thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a men's tournament, a thousand companies will want to sponsor it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And if there's an opening in the LPGA schedule book for a tournament? 
</P>
<P>
A harder sell, suggests Igarashi. 
</P>
<P>
A spot in a pro-am foursome might cost about $3,000 at a PGA tournament. At an 
LPGA tournament, Igarashi said, that same foursome spot could be had for 
$1,000, maybe less. "It's a tough sell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to Hindsight Lesson No. 2: Pay attention to all the little 
people who made it possible. 
</P>
<P>
If Igarashi has one regret about the way he ran the Uniden, it was his 
mishandling of the 800 or so volunteers needed to ensure a tournament's 
success. He warns the folks at Los Coyotes not to make the same mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have paid more attention to those people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight Lesson No. 3 is simple enough: Don't underestimate Orange County's 
love of golf. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of golfers exist here," Igarashi said, which isn't exactly a news flash. 
Ever try getting a tee time around here? Unless you slip the starter a crisp 
new Andrew Jackson, you'll never do better than a 5:21 a.m. appointment with 
the first tee. As a general rule of thumb, I prefer to actually be awake when I 
swing something with perimeter weighting. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Igarashi's point is well taken. Not only are there few courses available 
for the hacking stiff around the area, there are even fewer tournaments, like 
none. Just imagine, he said, if an LPGA event gained a foothold and, better 
yet, a following. The sponsor might see black in its ledgers, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Hindsight Lesson No. 4: Pray for no rain, a sudden-death playoff and the 
emergence of someone with a little crowd appeal. 
</P>
<P>
I've got a better idea: Just wish for a signed contract and a commitment -- to 
the LPGA and our close, personal friend, Orange County.

GENEVA CORP. AGAIN TOPS THE LIST OF COMPANIES HANDLING MERGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the second year in a row, Geneva Corp. in Irvine initiated and closed more 
mergers and acquisitions than any company in the nation, according to Corporate 
Financing Week. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva was involved in 80 corporate purchases last year, compared to 50 mergers 
and acquisitions it arranged the previous year, the trade publication reported. 
</P>
<P>
Its nearest competitor, Henry Ansbacher Group, completed 45 transactions last 
year, according to the publication. 
</P>
<P>
The ranking is based on the number of deals that the companies advertise in the 
Wall Street Journal. The ranking does not reflect the complexity or size of 
transactions and does not include unadvertised deals. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva specializes in fostering mergers and acquisitions of middle market 
companies -- those with sales of up to $100 million -- and the value of all its 
deals together is less than $1 billion, far below the value of mega-deals like 
the $24.5-billion takeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
Geneva executives have said that last year's record pace in M&amp;A activity -- 
including a record pace in Orange County -- should continue this year as 
companies hurry to avoid anticipated increases in interest rates and decreases 
in tax benefits for mergers, as well as a widely predicted recession. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, about 35,000 businesses are expected to change hands this year, 
Geneva has predicted. Up to 5% of those deals will involve divestitures -- 
companies spinning off divisions. Divestitures are expected to be a growing 
part of the M&amp;A scene if the economy slows down this year, as Geneva has 
predicted.

MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES: JEAN COCTEAU CENTENARY FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
CENTENARY FESTIVAL TO OFFER BALLET WITH UNRESOLVED TIES TO COCTEAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Pasles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Cocteau is best known as a film maker and playwright, but he also left his 
mark in the ballet world by creating scenarios for Diaghilev-era ballets such 
as Fokine's "Le Dieu Bleu," Massine's "Parade" and Nijinska's "Le Train Bleu." 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, the one dance work that is being offered as part of this month's 
Cocteau Centenary Festival at UC Irvine is Nijinska's "Les Biches," for which 
Cocteau's contributions are harder to pin down. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Oakland Ballet's plan was to revive Nijinska's "Le Train Bleu" 
(1924), in which Cocteau's direct involvement was well documented. But a 
dispute over who owned the ballet derailed the project. The public explanation 
now is that the reconstruction could not be finished in time. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, this weekend at UCI, the company will present "Les Biches," which has 
been in its repertory for 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the few ballets that dealt with people of that time," Oakland's 
artistic director Ronn Guidi said recently. "It took a hard look at Parisian 
society and role-playing. There is a lot of humor and satire. But it (also) 
hints at lots of things and is all mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if you go to a party, recognize that something is going on, but you 
can't put your finger on it. Then it's over and you still don't know what was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
As to the ballet's connection with Cocteau, it is known that "Les Biches" was 
based on a play, "Le Gendarme Incompris" ("The Misunderstood Policeman"), by 
Cocteau and Raymond Radiguet, which composer Francis Poulenc brought to the 
attention of choreographer Bronislava Nijinska, sister of famed 
dancer-choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. 
</P>
<P>
"Bronislava and Cocteau had a tenuous relationship . . . ," Guidi said. 
"Cocteau was the kind of man you wanted to love and choke at the same time. 
Picasso had that kind of relationship with him. . . . (So) we don't know how 
much involvement (Cocteau) actually had in creating the ballet. Unless we can 
get to some of the letters, which are in private collections, we'll never 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The ballet's title means "the does" (female deer), but more colloquially simply 
"girls," "young ladies" or "the little darlings." Some companies have preferred 
to call the work "The House Party" or "The Gazelles." 
</P>
<P>
Although the work was created in 1924, Guidi said he believes that the ballet 
"could be turned right around and be done in contemporary society. Take any 
corporate or social party today," he said. "You'd find the same rituals and 
consciousness of role-playing. 'Les Biches' would live in different dress and 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The ballet consists of a house party at a Parisian "smart set," and shows 
various permutations of flirtations between the guests, the hostess and a 
sexually ambiguous figure in blue. 
</P>
<P>
What was scandalous in 1924, for those few who could puzzle out the plot, was 
the relationship between two girls in gray. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look carefully, they are lovers," Guidi said. "This was the great 
scandal. But a lot of people missed that. The ballet ends when the two women 
look at each other and recognize their relationship, then it goes into the 
finale." 
</P>
<P>
Nijinska created the role of the hostess for herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The hostess is in yellow, the color of faded love," Guidi said. "She's been 
kind of through it all. In the 'Rag Mazurka,' she reduces the men to poodles, 
puppy dogs, if you will. They are so busy being masculine, she parodies the way 
they stand and relate to women, though it is stylized tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
Guidi said the role is "very taxing, with a lot of very 
</P>
<P>
intricate batterie work. 
</P>
<P>
"But the average person is not going to notice, unless they look very 
carefully. . . . They're going to be watching the cigarette holder and the 
feather in her hair." 
</P>
<P>
Reconstructions of ballets from the past can be problematic, but Guidi said 
that there is "no conjecture" about the authenticity of any of the choreography 
the audience will see in "Les Biches." 
</P>
<P>
"Nijinska had revived the work for the Royal Ballet in 1964, and it was totally 
notated in the Benesh system at that time," Guidi said. "That's where our 
production comes from. The Benesh notator came over and set (it) for us." 
</P>
<P>
(Nijinska also revived "Les Noces" for the Royal in 1966, and it too was 
notated and later acquired by Oakland Ballet.) 
</P>
<P>
The choreographer's daughter, Irina Nijinska, also helped the Oakland forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Irina had danced in both ballets much earlier," Guidi said, "and she came and 
talked about the style and being there at the reconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Ballet's participation in the Cocteau Festival is more the result 
of fortuitous timing than of special planning, according to Guidi. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to come down to Irvine anyway," he said. "The company dances at 
UC Irvine about every 3 years. The suggestion was made from the (co-sponsoring) 
Severin Wunderman Foundation, could we include something from Cocteau?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland Ballet will dance Nijinska's "Les Biches" at 8 p.m. Friday and 
Saturday at the Fine Arts Village Theatre at UC Irvine. The performances are 
part of the Cocteau Centenary Festival. Friday's program will also include 
excerpts from Massine's "La Boutique Fantasque," Balanchine's "Hand of Fate" 
pas de deux and Fokine's "Polovtsian Dances." Saturday's program will also 
include "La Boutique Fantasque" and two works by company artistic director Ronn 
Guidi, "Trois Gymnopedies" and "Gallops and Kisses." Tickets: $12. Information: 
(714) 856-5589.

 HILL STREET SECTION OPEN THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times reported incorrectly Tuesday that a stretch of Hill Street in 
downtown Los Angeles, closed two weeks ago to shore up a Metro Rail tunnel, 
would not reopen until next week. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the road was reopened to traffic on Monday, according to Greg Davy, a 
spokesman for the Southern California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
The segment was shut after construction engineers found unexpected stress on 
the struts that support a 1,000-foot section of Hill Street above the tunnel 
between Temple and 1st streets. Several horizontal steel struts were added to 
the 80-foot-deep tunnel.

<P>
Three challengers in the race to unseat Los Angeles Councilman Mike Woo -- 
including the two front-runners -- have failed to qualify for the ballot, 
leaving Woo and three relatively unknown candidates in the April 11 contest. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett Kayser, former president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon 
Assns. and the candidate who was expected to give Woo the toughest fight, fell 
99 valid signatures short of the 500 needed to qualify, the City Clerk's office 
said on Tuesday. Kayser had submitted 598 signatures, but 197 were found to be 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Trias, a former Los Angeles School Board member from the Hollywood area, 
fell short by 170 valid signatures, the clerk's office said. Trias submitted 
571 signatures, but 241 were determined to be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Howard Obata, was also disqualified. Obata, a postal clerk 
who is relatively unknown in the district, submitted 657 signatures, but 284 
were invalid, the clerk's office said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Woo, three candidates qualified for the ballot: Berndt 
Lohr-Schmidt, an attorney who has opposed Woo's efforts to impose restrictions 
on hillside building; Venus De Milo, a computer consultant who ran 
unsuccessfully for mayor and county supervisor, and Zahrina Machadah, a 
business consultant from Beachwood Canyon.

'RAIN MAN' GIVEN 8 OSCAR NOMINATIONS; SIGOURNEY 2; 
</P>
<P>
HOFFMAN WINS 6TH ACTING NOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
MGM/UA's "Rain Man" took a narrow lead in the 61st Oscar race today with eight 
nominations, including Dustin Hoffman's sixth best-actor nod for his portrayal 
of a numbers-crunching autistic savant on a cross-country trek with his hustler 
brother, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced at a 
pre-dawn news conference at its Beverly Hills headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The popular "Rain Man" -- which has grossed more than $100 million since its 
December premiere -- also received nominations for best picture, directing, 
screenplay written directly for the screen, art direction, editing, original 
music and cinematography. 
</P>
<P>
Sigourney Weaver became the fifth performer in Oscar history to receive two 
acting nominations in one year. Weaver was nominated as best actress for 
playing murdered naturalist Dian Fossey in "Gorillas in the Mist" 
(Universal/Warner) and as best supporting actress for playing a mean, 
exploitative executive in "Working Girl." The last actress to receive dual 
nominations was Jessica Lange in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The other top film nominees are best-picture candidates "Dangerous Liaisons" 
from Warner Bros. and Orion's "Mississippi Burning," which received seven 
nominations each, and 20th Century Fox's best-picture nominee "Working Girl" 
with six nominations and Touchstone's hugely successful "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit" with six nominations in technical categories. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the five-film slate of best-picture nominees is Warner's "The 
Accidental Tourist," which received a total of four nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The Oscar nominees were announced at an academy news conference that was held 
at 5:30 a.m. in order to receive live coverage from the major networks' 
early-morning news programs. The Oscars will be presented March 29 at the 
Shrine Civic Auditorium. The ceremony will be broadcast on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
In a major surprise, Martin Scorsese got a best director nomination for "The 
Last Temptation of Christ" (Universal), after the iconoclastic and 
controversial film about Jesus Christ was passed over in earlier movie awards. 
Other best director nominees are Charles Crichton for "A Fish Called Wanda" 
(MGM/UA), Alan Parker for "Mississippi Burning," Barry Levinson for "Rain Man" 
and Mike Nichols for "Working Girl." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Weaver, the best actress nominees are Glenn Close, who received her 
fifth Oscar nomination for her performance as a coldly manipulative seductress 
in "Dangerous Liaisons"; Jodie Foster, who played a rape victim in Paramount's 
"The Accused"; Melanie Griffith, who played an ambitious secretary in "Working 
Girl," and Meryl Streep, who played a mother accused of child-murder in 
Warner's "A Cry in the Dark." Streep, who has been nominated for eight Oscars 
in her career, is the only previous best-actress winner in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Joining one-time best-actor winner Hoffman among the nominees is another 
previous winner, Gene Hackman. He received the nod for his performance as an 
FBI agent in "Mississippi Burning." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the best-actor pack are all first-time nominees: Tom Hanks, as a 
boy trapped in a man's body in Fox's "Big"; Edward James Olmos, as Los Angeles 
teacher Jaime Escalante in Warner's "Stand and Deliver," and Max von Sydow, as 
a Swedish farmhand in Miramax's "Pelle the Conqueror." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Weaver, the best supporting actresses include first-time 
nominees Joan Cusack for "Working Girl," Geena Davis for "Accidental Tourist," 
Frances McDormand for "Mississippi Burning" and Michelle Pfeiffer for 
"Dangerous Liaisons." 
</P>
<P>
Best supporting actor nominees are two-time Oscar-winner Alec Guinness for 
Cannon's "Little Dorrit" and first-time nominees Kevin Kline for "A Fish Called 
Wanda"; Marin Landau for Paramount's "Tucker: The Man and his Dream"; River 
Phoenix for Warner's "Running on Empty," and Dean Stockwell for Orion's 
"Married to the Mob." 
</P>
<P>
Nominees for best original screenplay were Gary Ross and Anne Spielberg for 
"Big," Ron Shelton, for Orion's "Bull Durham," John Cleese for "A Fish Called 
Wanda," Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow for "Rain Man," and Naomi Foner for 
"Running on Empty." 
</P>
<P>
Best screenplay from another medium nominees were Frank Galati and Lawrence 
Kasdan for "The Accidental Tourist," Christopher Hampton for "Dangerous 
Liaisons," Anna Hamilton Phelan for "Gorillas in the Mist," Christine Edzard 
for "Little Dorrit," and Jean-Claude Carriere and Philip Kaufman for "The 
Unbearable Lightness of Being."

A major exhibition of avant-garde art, which opened amid controversy last week, 
was closed for a second time today after an anonymous letter writer threatened 
to blow up the gallery, artists said. 
</P>
<P>
Police barred the entrance to the prestigious China Art Gallery in central 
Beijing and authorities posted a sign saying the show was closed for two days 
for security reasons. The exhibition of pieces satirical, sexual and strange 
opened with a bang Feb. 5 when a woman pulled out a small pistol and fired two 
bullets into her work -- two glass telephone booths -- as an expression of 
"action art."

BUSH PLEDGES TO WORK ON SPENDING CUTS

<P>
President Bush, hitting the road to drum up support for his new budget 
proposal, pledged today to work with Congress on spending cuts and said, "We 
weren't sent to Washington to sit on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Although members of Congress are pressing him for details on where he wants to 
make about $10 billion in proposed cuts, Bush deferred that decision to future 
negotiations between his Administration and Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a joint session of the South Carolina Legislature that was 
interrupted by applause several times, Bush said he has no intention of sitting 
by and allowing cuts to be made across the board under provisions of the 
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to work with the Congress to make those hard choices," the 
President said. "We weren't sent to Washington to sit on our hands, either to 
pass the cost of indecision on to working Americans by raising their taxes or 
to fail to reduce the deficit, which will cause the cuts to be done 
automatically under the law." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a 'DOA' Budget 
</P>
<P>
Bush boasted that no one had termed his budget proposal that he delivered last 
week to Congress "DOA," or dead on arrival. Leaders of the 
Democratic-controlled Congress often used that term to describe the budgets 
that former President Ronald Reagan submitted in the latter years of his 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone wants to use the term DOA now, Bush said, he has his own 
interpretation of the acronym -- "defining opportunity for Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The President had lunch at the residence of Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell 
Jr., a longtime friend, before his flight back to Washington in early 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
For the second of his out-of-town budget speeches, Bush chose another state 
that played a major role in his election victory last year, after visiting New 
Hampshire on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush won the South Carolina Republican presidential primary on March 5. That 
victory, which followed his win in New Hampshire, catapulted him toward the 
near-sweep of the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses on March 8.

Election Commissioner Lakshman Perera. No results are expected until Thursday. 
More than 1,000 people, including 14 candidates, have been slain since 
campaigning started Jan. 6. Sinhalese and Tamil militants vowed to disrupt the

A Taiwan manufacturer's suggestion that American companies buy foreign-made 
U.S. flags and replace "Made in Taiwan" labels with "Made in U.S.A." has caused 
a small uproar on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years as a member of Congress, few issues have struck me as being as 
blatantly outrageous" as the label-switch proposal, Rep. Douglas Applegate 
(D-Ohio) wrote in a letter seeking a Customs Service investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate was one of several members of Congress who asked Customs to look into 
the issue. The inquiries were triggered by a letter-writing campaign by 
domestic flag manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we can compete with a U.S. flag labeled 'Made in Taiwan' but we cannot 
compete with a U.S. flag labeled 'Made in U.S.A.' when in fact it wasn't," 
wrote Vane Scott, general manager of the Colonial Flag Co. in Coshocton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Scott provided Applegate with a copy of a three-page 1987 solicitation on the 
letterhead of the Ming Teh Flag Co. Ltd. of Taipei, Taiwan, which suggested 
changing "Made in Taiwan" labels after the flag shipments had cleared Customs. 
</P>
<P>
"We can realize why you need to lift off this label . . . to prevent the 
resistance in U.S. to import flags," the solicitation said. "If possible, we 
suggest you cut off this label after you receive the goods and spend very 
little cost to mark on the flags your own brand name and Made In U.S.A. signs." 
</P>
<P>
"We can offer the labels too," the solicitation added. 
</P>
<P>
The copy, which does not show to whom the solicitation was originally 
addressed, was forwarded to Customs by several congressional offices. About a 
week ago the Customs Service asked the Federal Trade Commission to look into 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Easton, special assistant for enforcement in the FTC Bureau of 
Consumer Protection, said there's no evidence yet that an American flag 
importer has violated country-of-origin labeling requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do anything," Easton said. "There's no violation in just sending a 
letter." 
</P>
<P>
Whitney Smith, executive director of the Flag Research Center in Winchester, 
Mass., said he had not heard of label-switching as a widespread problem, but 
had heard complaints of textile companies in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong 
cutting into the domestic market with foreign-made Stars and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, he said, the foreign companies send semi-finished products to 
the United States, where they are completed and perhaps packaged along with 
poles and decorative eagles. 
</P>
<P>
If more than half of the contents in a package come from the United States, a 
company can legally remove a country-of-origin label such as "Made in Taiwan," 
said Easton. But "they can't say 'Made in U.S.A.' unless it's made in the 
U.S.A.," he said.

U.S. oil imports soared to more than 8 million barrels a day in January for the

to dwindle, an industry trade group said today.

The American Petroleum Institute, which represents major oil producers and 
refiners, said U.S. oil production fell to 7.9 million barrels a day, a 3.4% 
drop from January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Production in Alaska, which had offset declines in other parts of the United 
States in recent years, slipped for the second straight month with no major new 
oil fields tapped, the Washington, D.C.-based group said in its monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
Imports of oil surged to an average of 8.2 million barrels a day, an increase 
of 20.6% over the January, 1988, level of 6.8 million barrels. It was the first 
month that imports averaged more than 8 million barrels since 1980, the API 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports and drop in domestic production has raised concerns about 
national security and other issues regarding U.S. dependence on foreign oil and 
many, mostly smaller, producers have called for some form of protective 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Major oil companies, meanwhile, have been directing more of their exploration 
and production dollars overseas where they say oil is cheaper and easier to 
find.

Rupert Murdoch's global media empire, News Corp. Ltd., today unveiled a 14.5% 
jump in operating earnings in the first half of its financial year, including a 
small profit for its fledgling Fox television network. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp. said its company-wide profit rose to $231 million in the six months 
ended Dec. 31 from $201 million a year earlier as sales jumped 21%. The results 
showed that the Fox Broadcasting Co., which News Corp. is trying to build into 
a fourth major U.S. television network, earned a small profit in the period, 
passing the break-even point in less time than most analysts had expected. News 
Corp. did not specify the amount of earnings produced by the unit, which had 
previously contributed a string of losses. Analysts figured it to be less than 
$1 million.

BUSH'S PLAN TO HELP S&amp;LS INADEQUATE, NADER WARNS

President Bush's plan to bail out ailing savings and loans does not provide 
enough money or reforms to rescue the thrift industry, consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader said today. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to disclose his proposals for fixing the S&amp;L crisis, 
Nader said he was glad that Bush, in outlining the Administration's proposed 
solution last week, has recognized a $100-billion problem exists. 
</P>
<P>
But Nader said that the Bush plan sharply underestimates the amount of money 
needed to bail out the insolvent thrifts and that taxpayers will be forced in 
future years to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not follow that the Bush government has to place the burden of the 
FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) bailout on the backs of those 
taxpayers who are the least able to pay," Nader said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead, the burden . . . should fall primarily on those most able to pay or 
engaged in financial activities providing only limited or arguable productive 
benefit to society," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush plan includes $40 billion in taxpayers' money, $50 billion in bonds to 
be repaid by the thrift industry, a federal takeover of about 300 insolvent 
institutions and new regulatory oversight by the Treasury Department and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which previously insured commercial banks but 
not thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
More than 500 of the nation's 3,100 thrifts are now broke or near to 
insolvency. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures 
deposits up to $100,000 in thrifts, cannot deal with the problem because it, 
too, is technically insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush plan inadequately addresses the problem of bank managers using 
depositors' money to make risky or bad loans or, as happened so often in recent 
years, engaging in fraud, Nader said.

Prosecutors today arrested two more top executives of companies at the center 
of a stock trading scandal, news reports said, bringing to six the number of 
people charged in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
Shunjiro Mamiya, the managing director of Recruit Co., a fast-growing business 
information conglomerate, and Seiichi Tateoka, the managing director of a real 
estate subsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos Co., were arrested on charges of violating 
the Securities and Exchange Law, television and news agency reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Today's arrests came two days after the parent company's founder, Hiromasa 
Ezoe, and three others were arrested on bribery charges. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests have shaken Japan's governing party and contributed to its loss in 
a special parliamentary election. Three Cabinet ministers and more than a dozen 
other prominent politicians and businessmen have resigned in the scandal.

Roger Clemens today agreed to a three-year contract with the Boston Red Sox 
worth $7.5 million, the highest average annual salary in baseball history, the 
Associated Press has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, will get a $300,000 signing bonus, 
$2.2 million this season, $2.5 million in 1990 and $2.5 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Including a prorated share of the signing bonus, Clemens will earn $2.6 million 
in each of the 1990 and 1991 seasons, which if not surpassed, would become the 
highest single-season salary ever in baseball. The previous high was Don 
Mattingly's $2.5-million 1990 salary from the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Dwight Gooden, who will receive $2,416,667, including a share of his 
signing bonus, from the New York Mets this year, is the highest-paid player in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
At four years, 142 days of major league service, Clemens reached $2 million 
faster than any other player in history, beating Minnesota's Kirby Puckett by 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his salary, Clemens can earn $350,000 per year in bonuses. He 
would get $100,000 for winning the Cy Young Award and $50,000 for finishing 
second. He would get $100,000 for winning the American League Most Valuable 
Player and $50,000 for finishing second or third. He would get $50,000 if he is 
MVP of the AL playoffs and $100,000 if he is MVP of the World Series.

sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner was honored recently as female athlete of the 
year. Lewis, a 19-year-old UCLA sophomore, was chosen over a field that 
included UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman and USC quarterback Rodney Peete. Lewis 
captured the 400 meters in 43.87 seconds and also won a gold medal for being a

The president of the International Olympic Committee encouraged Atlanta 
officials today to continue fighting to host the 1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Antonio Samaranch was making his first visit to the city since it became 
the U.S. nominee for the 1996 Olympics. His schedule included a tour of the 
city's sports facilities as well as meetings with government and business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say -- you will be one of the six candidates," he told a joint 
session of the Georgia Legislature. "But I think with public and private 
support, the beautiful Atlanta can be very, very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch was accompanied by Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Bob Helmick, 
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. After a lunch with former Olympians 
from Georgia, he was to cut the ribbon to officially open the Atlanta 
Organizing Committee's office. 
</P>
<P>
Samaranch told the Legislature that he is often asked what a city must have to 
put together a winning package for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
His answer, he said, is always "the right people . . . and I hope and I think 
you have the right people now working and fighting to get the games for 
Atlanta."
