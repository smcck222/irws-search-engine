'JAPAN SEEKS WORLD INFLUENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Arabic proverb warns, "If the camel once gets his nose in the tent, his body 
will soon follow." This was brought to mind while reading "Japan Foresees a 
Joint Global Role With U.S." (Part I, Feb. 4). 
</P>
<P>
In its foreign affairs and diplomatic efforts, the United States has often 
deserved a prize as the boob of the moment but not so poignantly as in the case 
of Japan. After sustaining a near-fatal blow on the day of infamy, America 
overcame an intransigent enemy in some of the bloodiest battles known to man. 
Nevertheless, from that point forward, we progressively restored its 
sovereignty and economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Japan subjected American business to unconscionable 
restrictions. The Japanese convinced successive U.S. Administrations to allow 
their goods open access to our lucrative markets. However, trade was neither 
free, fair nor reciprocal. Unbelievably, U.S. representatives continue to 
applaud the arrangement. Using every trick in the book, aided and abetted by 
official agencies of the Japanese government, their economy gained advantages 
of astounding proportions. Without exaggeration, it has reached the point where 
unilateral action by Japan can produce the immediate economic collapse of the 
United States. That threat is now being exercised to expand the global 
influence of the Rising Sun. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, "Why does Japan need a global role with the United States?" 
The answer is obvious: Japan needs America's worldwide military and diplomatic 
machinery to serve its selfish purposes. Already, we have been used to protect 
Japan's oil interests in the Middle East. In trade talks, America does its best 
to convince other trading partners to subscribe to the same stupidity with 
Japan as the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The final indignity is Japan's recent public criticism of a litany of American 
problems ranging from narcotics to the huge budget deficit. I submit, the 
entire camel now occupies the tent.

PREPARING FOR DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As California inches closer to a third consecutive drought year, Metropolitan 
Water District and other Southland water agencies are laying detailed plans for 
reducing water use this summer (editorial, "The Dry Years," Feb. 2). 
</P>
<P>
How stringent these measures will be depends, of course, on how dry the rest of 
this winter is. Hopefully, a bounty of snow and rain will hit the state -- 
particularly in Northern California -- making the whole issue moot. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Southern California will again be able to draw a full supply of 
water from the Colorado River this year, which will help this region meet its 
overall water needs. These supplies, however, are no longer dependable and are 
only being made available on a year-by-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Metropolitan is developing a tiered plan of action to promote 
conservation as the summer approaches. This plan includes a major public 
information campaign aimed at alerting Southern Californians about the state's 
drought and the need to save water. Last year, similar efforts were undertaken 
and consumers responded by saving about 30 billion gallons of water -- enough 
to meet the annual residential needs of approximately 180,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with these public information activities, MWD will, if 
necessary, activate its interruptable water service program by curtailing 
ground-water recharge programs and deliveries to storage reservoirs, easing 
pressure on strained State Water Project reservoirs in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
While Southern California's supplies appear sufficient at this juncture, other 
parts of the state which rely on less dependable water systems could face 
severe shortages this summer. Over the past 70 years, Southern Californians 
have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in water transfer and storage 
projects to both meet demand and protect against multi-year drought. That 
investment is paying off during this dry period and, with the cooperation of 
the 14.5 million people in our service area, should see us through a dry 1989 
without highly restrictive water-use rules. 
</P>
<P>
We can minimize the frequency of droughts by providing a reliable and stable 
water supply through the construction of additional features on the State Water 
Project, including needed storage facilities and a more efficient means of 
transporting water. Such projects would be in addition to adopting water 
conservation as a way of life.

HUMAN BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During my years working in chemistry and invention-processing, I used to think 
that technical progress in the physical sciences was both the blessing and hope 
of humankind. Just look at all the marvelous labor-saving and entertainment 
devices that research and engineering have given us! They may soon offer us 
round-trip service to the moon! 
</P>
<P>
No longer. I now believe that progress in the field of human behavior is much 
more important. Researching human behavior is far more difficult than learning 
to manipulate the more predictable electrons. Nevertheless, developing a 
greater understanding of ourselves can improve the course of civilization much 
more than an endless succession of slick gadgets that not everyone can afford. 
</P>
<P>
We desperately need more progress in dealing with anti-social behavior, 
rehabilitating criminals, motivating the apathetic, healing damaged psyches, 
instilling self-esteem and self-confidence, stimulating creativity, and 
generally fostering the attainment of human potential. 
</P>
<P>
Were it up to me, I'd slowly reduce funding for our long-running arms race 
(researching weaponry is in itself dehumanizing), and correspondingly increase 
research in human behavior and human development. 
</P>
<P>
This might not be as popular as the "Rambo" approach to problem solving, but I 
somehow think that the ancient prophets would smile.

CLEAN-AIR CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California's balmy climate and bustling economy have conspired to lure 
enough people to the region to fill in most of its wide-open spaces, in the air 
as well as on the land. 
</P>
<P>
So far the land is bearing up reasonably well. The air is not. There was an 
unhealthful amount of ozone in Southern California's air on 180 days last year. 
Houston and New York City are not even close seconds at 20 days a year. It is 
the only area in the nation that still fails to meet health standards on 
nitrogen oxides, which are byproducts of burning fuels in anything from cars to 
power mowers. Last year the number of bad ozone days climbed again after 
several years of falling. All this remains the case nearly 20 years after 
scientists persuaded Congress to pass the Clean Air Act because living in dirty 
air is bad for people. 
</P>
<P>
There is more to come. There will be nearly half again as many cars in the Los 
Angeles air basin 20 years from now. Population will increase from its present 
13 million to 18 million. In the natural course of events the air will get 
dirtier with each new car and each new power mower. 
</P>
<P>
A month from today the South Coast Air Quality Management District -- the lead 
smog agency for Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties -- 
will vote on a plan to change the natural course of events. The plan is the 
most comprehensive anti-pollution program ever drafted anywhere in the world. 
Despite its scope, a vote to put the plan into effect would mean changing the 
habits of many Southern Californians but not fundamentally changing the way 
they live. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a natural resistance to change. Some of plan's proposals would 
take effect rather suddenly, even though it would be 17 years before the air 
was as clean as it must be. Under the circumstances the smog agency would have 
a better chance of making the plan work if business was solidly behind the 
program instead of sniping at it -- often with half-truths. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the formal comment on the plan by the Los Angeles Chamber of 
Commerce says that it "will cost jobs." It also says that anything that would 
drive business out of the basin must be examined "with gravest concern." Other 
critics put the job loss at 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
The job-loss figure is half-fact. The Southern California Assn. of Governments 
estimates that the region will create 1.4 million new jobs during the 20 years 
after the clean-air plan takes hold. By one estimate, the number of new jobs 
might be 50,000 higher if business did not have to contend with new pollution 
controls. It can easily be argued that without new controls the number of new 
jobs would fall well short of 1.4 million because companies would look 
elsewhere for cleaner air. As The Times reported on Thursday, one-third of 
Southern California's executive recruiters say that smog already is a major 
factor when candidates pass up jobs in the basin. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to crush the district plan, Southern California Edison Co. promotes an 
alternative in which trapping hydrocarbons and other organic gases from 
escaping into the air would be emphasized over controls on nitrogen oxides. 
Smog is created when sunlight cooks an airborne mixture of nitrogen oxides and 
hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
Edison says that its plan would get rid of ozone faster and at less cost, which 
may or may not be half-true -- depending on which air chemist you consult. In 
any event the plan would meet health standards only for ozone, not for nitrogen 
oxides or soot and other particulates. Thus the Edison plan would not meet 
federal clean-air standards. 
</P>
<P>
Edison cites the high cost of trapping nitrogen oxides at its power plants as 
one reason for adopting its alternative. But manufacturers of such controls 
told district officials recently that the utility estimate of the cost of 
controls is four times the actual cost and that prices for controls are still 
falling. The inflated figure just intensifies questions about the rest of its 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the smog agency's plan have been acting as though Southern 
California faced a choice only between the official plan and the Edison 
substitute. In fact, there is a third -- far worse -- option. The U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to impose its own plan to clean up 
the air in 1990 if Southern California's smog agency hesitates to start along a 
path that will meet federal air-quality standards; the agency made the promise 
to settle a suit brought by the Sierra Club and the Coalition for Clean Air. 
The federal government has no authority to intervene in some areas reserved to 
local law, so it could not use land-use planning and some other devices that 
the air-quality district intends to use. To make up for that, federal controls 
on sources over which Washington does have authority would need to be far more 
severe than what the smog district has in mind. Southern California might be 
able to live with a federal plan, but should not bet its future on it. It can 
avoid the gamble if business leaders will face up to the fact that the air 
district's plan is the best that they can get and start supporting it.

STRAIN IS BUILDING IN THE ENGINE DRIVING CALIFORNIA'S PROSPERITY -- ITS 
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W. ANN REYNOLDS, W. Ann Reynolds is the chancellor of California State 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we drive our state's infamous freeways, in every direction we can clearly 
see the evidence of growth. Orange and lemon groves have become housing 
subdivisions. Deserts have been turned into trendy shopping malls. There's 
drive-up window service for everything from breakfast to banking on land that 
held only shrubs and bushes just months before. The entire state is fairly 
bursting at the seams with people from all over the world flocking here for a 
share in the golden dream. 
</P>
<P>
California's higher-education system is not immune to the effects of this 
phenomenal growth. However, in spite of indisputable evidence of the rise in 
the demand for a college education, there are those who are suggesting that new 
campuses are not required to adequately educate these future students, and that 
higher-education leaders are merely trying to seize an opportunity to expand 
their own territory. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other areas of the country, California is not seeing a drop in college 
enrollment, primarily because of increasing numbers of eligible high-school 
students wanting a college education and high in-migration from other states 
and nations. 
</P>
<P>
California State University currently serves more than 355,000 students on 19 
campuses. By the year 2000 our enrollment is expected to increase by 100,000 
students. To try to accommodate this enrollment boom, the state university 
system is planning a 20th campus in northern San Diego County and is expanding 
facilities in Ventura and Contra Costa counties. These projections of increased 
enrollment are not limited to Cal State. The University of California, 
anticipating a jump of 63,000, has projected a need for three new campuses. The 
community colleges expect to enroll about 200,000 students over the next 16 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The California Postsecondary Education Commission requires extensive 
justification for any new campus. Twenty factors must be thoroughly analyzed, 
including capacity on existing campuses and in other parts of the system, 
expansion of existing facilities and current and projected demographics. 
</P>
<P>
Educators always start with the premise that growth can be accommodated at 
existing facilities, and they conclude that a new campus is necessary only when 
the data point to no other viable option. Neither Cal State nor UC has built a 
campus since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, for example, California State University enrollment 
has increased by 30,000 students, and every means possible has been utilized to 
serve them. The system operates seven off-campus centers or satellite campuses 
to meet demand in areas where another campus would not be warranted. The most 
overcrowded campuses may close enrollment to freshmen and sophomores, thus 
encouraging them to use their excellent community colleges. In rural areas 
extensive use is made of satellite communication to televise classes to 
students in sparsely populated and less accessible areas. Educators are acutely 
aware of their public trust, and will not betray it to build unnecessary 
university campuses. 
</P>
<P>
This state's citizens realized long ago that their economic prosperity and 
social well-being depended on an educated citizenry. California's major 
industries -- like high technology, banking, agriculture and aerospace -- all 
rely on a highly skilled, literate work force. And it's the state's 
higher-education system that helps fuel this gigantic enterprise. If 
Californians are to continue to be served by an outstanding higher-education 
system, they must acknowledge the devastating effect of the Gann limit. Passed 
by the voters in 1979, it puts a cap on state spending and severely restricts 
our ability to provide the structures and equipment necessary to educate 
students for tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Education is an investment, and when it grows everybody profits. Our local 
communities, the nation and the world benefit from scientific research 
conducted by university professors. California State University alone educates 
70% of the state's teachers, more than 50% of the engineers, about 65% of the 
graduates in agriculture and 40% of those in fine and applied arts; we are the 
leading source of new employees for California businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Growth is a California fact of life, and the university system is a vital part 
of that life. As the state's educational leaders, we would be irresponsible to 
bury our heads in the sand and hope that these students will go away. They will 
not, nor do we want them to. We want the support of the people of this state so 
that they can in the future as in the past be the beneficiaries of the world's 
most successful system of higher education.

A REMARKABLE REALISM ON AFGHANISTAN;

GORBACHEV SAW THE FUTILITY, WE SHOULD SEE THE OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAM ALLISON, Graham Allison is the dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy 
School of Government and the editor of the forthcoming Windows of Opportunity: 
From Cold War to Peaceful Competition, a joint study of American and Soviet 
academics and policy advisers. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The withdrawal of the last Soviet soldier from Afghanistan is an occasion not 
only for rejoicing but for reflection as well. The effect of Soviet defeat may 
prove more profound than the consequences of American failure in Vietnam. 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's remarkable realism here demonstrates an unprecedented 
willingness to cooperate in resolving regional conflicts. More recent 
initiatives in Angola and Cambodia suggest that this willingness extends to 
other conflicts, too. Even in Central America, the graveyard of the 
Reagan-Shultz-Abrams campaign to overthrow the Sandinistas, a satisfactory 
settlement appears within reach -- if the United States has the will to 
stretch. Current circumstances present the Bush Administration with the widest 
window of opportunity in the postwar period to decisively conclude the era of 
Soviet "wars of liberation." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, when the Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan, no one could have dreamed 
of such an outcome. To appreciate the magnitude of this victory and its 
implications, it is necessary to go back nine years to American and Soviet 
perceptions of the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
For President Jimmy Carter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was a formative 
experience. As he confessed: "This action of the Soviets has made a more 
dramatic change in my opinion of what the Soviets' ultimate goals are than 
anything they've done in the previous time that I've been in office." 
</P>
<P>
The Carter Administration interpreted the Soviet action as a geostrategic grab. 
Afghanistan translated the Soviet military buildup into action. For the first 
time since World War II, Soviet military forces were directly engaged outside 
Europe. Afghanistan represented a calculated step in Russia's centuries-old 
quest for warm-water ports. Domination of the world's strategic oil reserves in 
the Persian Gulf was the unspoken prize. 
</P>
<P>
All this became conventional wisdom after 1980 and shaped the Reagan 
Administration's views of Soviet ambitions. Indeed, it continues to dominate 
the thinking of many Americans today. 
</P>
<P>
Statements by the Soviet government and commentaries by Soviet advisers did 
little to allay the American concerns. In conversations with Westerners, even 
Soviets who had opposed Soviet intervention made a point of emphasizing the 
difference between Afghanistan and Vietnam. As one told me bluntly: "Whatever 
the merits of the decision, having decided to act, the Soviet Union will do 
whatever is necessary to win. We will never bug out for lack of guts or heart." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Gorbachev has accepted defeat, with only a fig leaf of calling it 
stalemate. He has not even demanded the "decent interval" that Henry A. 
Kissinger sought in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Americans who believed, as I did, that Afghanistan constituted a geostrategic 
challenge must now ask how Gorbachev's reversal of that policy can be 
explained. In the light of the potential benefits of success, and the probable 
consequences of failure, what kind of Soviet leader and what kind of Soviet 
Union could actually do such a thing? 
</P>
<P>
A chorus of commentary explains simply that the Soviets found the costs 
exceeding the benefits. But this tautology just rephrases the puzzle. Clearly 
the combination of Afghan courage, Western supplies (including American Stinger 
missiles), international condemnation and domestic discontent imposed heavy 
costs. But who says that these costs exceed the benefits of realizing a 
venerable geopolitical aspiration? Had the Soviet Union continued the war and 
even annexed Afghanistan or parts thereof, these pundits would solemnly 
announce that the benefits exceeded the costs. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the consequences of Soviet acceptance of defeat and withdrawal. How 
will the Soviet army explain to itself and its supporters that a military 
establishment that consumes 15%-20% of the Soviet gross national product, that 
faced no restrictions on its pursuit of the war, in a system of government that 
puts long-term interests ahead of short-term pressures of public opinion, 
nonetheless lost. Even more significant will be the reverberations in Soviet 
satellite and client states, since the defeat in Afghanistan rolls back for the 
first time the Brezhnev doctrine of the irreversibility of communist gains. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen in Afghanistan? The Soviet client government is unlikely to 
last as long as Nguyen Van Thieu did in Vietnam. The prospects of continuing 
warfare and instability, perhaps even a "Lebanon" right on the Soviet border, 
cannot be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial factor explaining the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan is 
Gorbachev. Reviewing the facts -- a declining Soviet economy, increasingly 
burdensome Third World clients and an international system evolving away from 
military-based bipolarity toward technologically determined multipolarity -- 
Gorbachev has come to a radically different conception of how the Soviet 
Union's interests can best be secured. While his predecessors sought greater 
security through support for Marxist-Leninist revolutions, Gorbachev has seen 
that real security can best be achieved, for the foreseeable future, through a 
normalization of relations that respects both sovereignty and international 
law. If the Bush Administration will think clearly about what U.S. interests 
require, it can now settle this aspect of the Cold War on terms that achieve 
our original objectives.

From Jimmy Swaggart to Jim and Tammy Bakker, the fundamentalist TV preaching 
industry can't seem to get a break these days -- even on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes HBO's brash, mocking and darkly funny miniseries "Glory! Glory!" (9 
p.m. Sunday and Monday) that seems to make its fictional praise-the-buck 
electronic ministry a grim metaphor for all of society. And in doing so -- with 
strong intonations of Paddy Chayefsky's visionary "Network" -- it affirms TV's 
mind-fuzzing seductiveness, whereby the medium itself assumes spirituality,

a stroke, leadership of his rich Church of the Companions of Christ TV empire 
in Waco, Tex., falls to his son, the pious and earnest, but bland, Rev. Bobby 
Joe (Richard Thomas). Donations, once $1 million a day, swiftly fall under 
Bobby Joe, and the ministry is near collapse until he recruits a boozing, 
coke-headed rock singer (Ellen Greene) to juice up his TV services. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Ruth, as she becomes known, uses her street-tough coarseness and singing 
to rejuvenate the ministry financially and to rise from the ashes of her own 
life. She also transforms herself and the church into TV phenomena that even 
attract the notice of a giant network: "This lady can do for us what Cosby did 
for NBC," an executive proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Greene, you believe it. She is raw, biting and sexy as Ruth, offering 
raspy eloquence as a singer while making an odd coupling with Thomas' mild, 
sniveling Bobby Joe. And James Whitmore is a scene stealer as Lester Babbitt, 
the pragmatic, manipulative church elder who is a consummate con man and the 
real brains behind the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
That "Glory! Glory!" periodically meanders and loses focus is undeniable. 
Written by Stan Daniels and directed by Lindsay Anderson, the 3 1/2-hour 
musical satire could be much tighter and firmer. It doesn't help that a key 
element of the story, in which the ministry is investigated by a TV reporter 
(Winston Rekert), bends credibility to the snapping point. Nor, surely, is 
there anything revolutionary about the fusion of religion and rock music. 
</P>
<P>
Yet "Glory! Glory!" is lively, thoroughly arresting, always interesting, 
sometimes inspired TV that strengthens HBO's standing as the medium's bold 
provocateur. Whereas 1982's "Pray TV" on ABC was weak and soggy, "Glory! 
Glory!" is energized by Steve Tyrell's music, Greene's bracing performance and 
the frequent sharp humor of Daniels' script. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Ruth becomes a recording star, one of her hit albums being titled "Satan 
Sucks." And when she coaches an actor on how to appear "healed" on TV, it's 
hilarious: "Let me see you gnarl your fingers . . . good! Good gnarling!" 
</P>
<P>
All the while, network executives consider Bobby Joe a dull "lox" and plot to 
turn him into a "sort of Christian Ed Sullivan" whose only role would be to 
introduce Sister Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the humor come dark omens and simmering pessimism, for everyone in 
this deeply cynical comedy/drama is viewed as ultimately corruptible. 
Characters temporarily occupy a moral high ground, only to topple to temptation 
just as "Glory! Glory!" seems on the verge of affirming their faith. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do, we do in a holy cause," Lester declares, articulating the eternal 
justification for using evil means in pursuit of honorable ends. 
</P>
<P>
As he speaks these words, images of real-life disgraced TV preachers flash in 
your mind -- preachers who constitute a distinct, but highly visible, minority 
among their fellow clergy. Yet by implication, this HBO production unfairly 
seems to extend its vision of bleakness, hypocrisy and dirty tricks to all 
electronic clergy. 
</P>
<P>
On "Glory! Glory!" meanwhile, it's always showtime in front of the cameras. An 
actor playing Jesus is affixed to a cross outlined in spotlights, as the line 
separating God and ratings continues to blur.

CBS breathed a sigh of relief Thursday and reported that its highest-rated 
entertainment series, "Murder, She Wrote," will return next fall for a sixth 
season. The network, running third in the prime-time ratings, already had 
locked up the professional services of the show's star, Angela Lansbury, but 
needed more time to work out an agreement with the show's producer, Universal 
Television.

Jorge Mester, music director of the Pasadena Symphony, will conduct the opening 
concert for the new Oakland East Bay Symphony, March 31. The inaugural season 
for the orchestra, which is attempting to fill the void left by the bankruptcy 
of the Oakland Symphony in 1986, lists five concerts through June 3, one of 
them a pops program. The orchestra has raised $120,000 towards its initial 
$360,000 budget, not counting a $100,000 matching grant from the City of 
Oakland. The new ensemble has enlisted 52 of the 72 players from the defunct 
orchestra.

OVERHEATED WOODS IN 'TRUE BELIEVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Eddie Dodd," sneers one of his well-heeled clients in "True Believer" 
(citywide). "Everyone should own one." Considering that attorney Dodd has just 
gotten this scum-sucking cocaine dealer off on a well-deserved drug rap, that's 
hardly gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
But flamed-out ex-'60s activist Dodd doesn't defend New York's every smack 
dealer and amphetamine manufacturer for their thank-you notes. The chunky 
packages of cash they send through the mail will do nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd is another in James Woods' dizzying catalogue of interchangeable 
characterizations in which only his hairdos vary. (Unsurprisingly, hipster Dodd 
wears a curly, graying pony-tail.) The sneer, the intensity, the percussive 
delivery that flattens everything in sight -- fellow actors especially -- 
remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
The reason to have hope for "True Believer" (language-rated R) was that 
director Joseph Ruben had shown some style before with "The Stepfather." 
However "The Stepfather" had Donald Westlake's gorgeous script. This one, by 
Wesley Strick, piles coincidence onto improbability and cliche onto 
unlikelihood until all our good will is used up. Ruben's stylistic devices, his 
high angle shots and his black-and-white recountings of courtroom testimony, 
become just so much cinematic corpse-rouging. 
</P>
<P>
The story involves Eddie Dodd's redemption through his defense of one single 
innocent client. He's a young Korean prisoner in Sing Sing, Shu Kai Kim (Yuji 
Okumoto), whom we see kill a Neo-Nazi fellow-inmate within the prison, in what 
might be called very well-prepared self-defense. Somehow, certainly not through 
anything persuasive about his client, Dodd decides that Kim was innocent of the 
crime which sent him to Sing Sing in the first place. And the scenario decides 
that freeing Kim will cleanse Dodd's soul. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Downey Jr., as Dodd's wildly idealistic new assistant, is along for a 
good deal of the cleansing. The characters are a hilarious assortment of 
tattooed Neo-Nazis, sweaty, corrupt cops and transparently evil lawmen in very 
high places. Their goings-on are photographed as though the camera, too, was 
wearing a green eyeshade. 
</P>
<P>
Under Woods' almost felonious assault, there seems to be one point at which 
Downey throws up his hands and quits, enlisting Margaret Colin, "private 
detective Kitty Greer," in his defection. They move, they speak, but the stuff 
that galvanizes them as actors seems to have evaporated. Take their hint.

'THE 'BURBS': THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a safe bet that Universal slated "The 'burbs" for its citywide opening 
today, hoping that Tom Hanks would get nominated for "Big." Certainly, this 
grimly unfunny comedy needs all the help that it can get. It's so bad it 
doesn't deserve the boost a Hanks nomination may give it. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever persuaded Hanks, especially now that he has hit his stride as actor 
and comedian of the first rank, to do this picture? For that matter, why was 
this turkey ever given the green light in the first place? (Didn't anyone 
remember Columbia's wretched and all-too-similar 1981 Belushi-Aykroyd 
"Neighbors"?) What was it that the savvy director Joe Dante saw in co-producer 
Dana Olsen's script? 
</P>
<P>
It's inconceivable that "The 'burbs" looked good on paper. Yet its makers are 
far from amateurs: This is the first film financed by Brian Grazer and Ron 
Howard's Imagine Entertainment and the initial production in the company's 
multipicture distribution deal with Universal. 
</P>
<P>
So much for speculation. What we're confronted with is the endlessly labored 
spectacle of three grown men (Hanks, Bruce Dern and Rick Ducommun) behaving 
like little boys when a weirdo family -- a Bela Lugosi-like doctor (Henry 
Gibson), his surly, monosyllabic brother (Brother Theodore) and a dim, 
goofy-looking kid (Courtney Gains) -- moves in the ramshackle Victorian in 
their cul-de-sac in Hinkley Hills. (True, the newcomers do seem to have 
installed a particularly ferocious furnace in the cellar.) 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, the three men get completely carried away when an elderly man 
(Gale Gordon) who lives at the end of their cul-de-sac disappears. (Why don't 
they -- or at least Hanks' marginally sensible wife, Carrie Fisher, or their 
bright teen-age neighbor Corey Feldman -- call the cops or check with Gordon's 
daughter as to his whereabouts?) 
</P>
<P>
Not only is there nothing amusing, or frightening, about the men's foolishness 
but there's no discernible point to it, except perhaps to suggest that the 
dullness of suburbia can rot your brain. A momentary plea for tolerance gives 
way to the apparent proposition that it's all right to torment your "different" 
neighbors because they may be a bad lot up to no good after all. It's hardly a 
wholesome message to send to the impressionable young audience for whom the 
film seems primarily intended. "The 'burbs" (rated PG) is the pits. KEVIN 
THOMAS

MACHISMO IS THE BIG JOKE IN 'SUCKA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Keenen Ivory Wayans' "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" (citywide), there's sometimes 
a light line between sendup and near-celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is a satire of the early '70s blaxploitation action movies: all the 
"Shafts," "Black Caesars" and "Superflys" with their natty, super-masculine 
heroes, flamboyant pimps and murderous drug czars. Its most obvious model is 
1980's "Airplane!" But, where the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker "Airplane!" team 
probably didn't much like the disaster movies they spoofed, Wayans is 
satirizing something he's closer to: urban street culture and the black 
super-heroes of his movie-going youth. On one level, he is having a giggle at 
the inflated, phony imagery. On another, maybe he misses it. 
</P>
<P>
Wayans, an engaging comic with a sweet smile, casts himself here as returning 
Army veteran Jack Spade. Machismo is a joke in "Sucka"; Spade is a mama's boy 
whose 10-year Army hitch won him medals for surfing and good conduct. Returning 
home to his mama (the formidable Ja'net Dubois), his dead brother's willing 
widow (Dawnn Lewis), and to a neighborhood despoiled by the vile depredations 
of vice-lord Mr. Big (John Vernon, once again coming up like thunder), Jack 
searches somewhere, anywhere, for a hero to model himself after. 
</P>
<P>
He finds, successively, supercop Slade (Bernie Casey of "Hit Man"), superpimp 
Flyguy (Antonio Fargas of "Cleopatra Jones"), rough-neck soul food titans 
Slammer and Hammer (Jim Brown of "Slaughter" and Isaac Hayes of "Truck Turner") 
and karate king Kung Fu Joe (Steve James of "American Ninja"), all of whom do 
straight-faced "Airplane!"-style sendups of their old or current image -- and 
all of whom, in the end, prove less ferocious than Jack's mama. 
</P>
<P>
Wayans' directing isn't up to his writing, and his writing isn't always up to 
his acting. And he misses one aspect of the black actioners almost completely: 
their pace and zonked-out, overheated style. He is also guilty of an occasional 
gross, tasteless scene, like the "take it all off" encounter with lascivious 
bar-girl Cherry, a woman of many parts. 
</P>
<P>
There are misfires in "Sucka," (MPAA rated R for language) but there's also 
some funny stuff. Wayans shows a refreshing taste for self-mockery, something 
his old "Raw" colleague, Eddie Murphy, might study. In one scene, as a gorgeous 
cabaret singer gives a shockingly bad rendition of "When the Saints Go Marching 
In" in pseudo-Sarah Vaughan style, the waiter explains to stunned patrons that 
she gets away with it because she is the director's sister. As it turns out, 
she (Kim Wayans) really is. MICHAEL WILMINGTON

NONNI OFFERS ITALIAN INSPIRATION IN ATWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a little corner of Atwater that is 100% Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when I say "a little corner," I mean a little restaurant, and when I 
say the Westside, I mean West L.A.'s Trattoria Angeli. Osteria Nonni has much 
the look and feel of a miniaturized Angeli, right down to the quaint 
pseudo-industrial design. The lighting, for instance, is sealed-beam lamps 
borne on spidery metal spokes sticking out of the walls. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a vague impression that Atwater is a one-gas station town somewhere 
in Kern County, you may wonder what Nonni's doing there. For your information, 
Atwater is a little neighborhood near the southern tip of Glendale and it 
happens to have its own quaint design tradition. (Take a drive up Brunswick 
Avenue, right around the corner from Nonni, and ask yourself what the architect 
who designed these fanciful buildings was going through.) 
</P>
<P>
Nonni's chef comes from Angeli, and the menu has Angeli written all over it, or 
at least a lot of it. There are the sandwiches made of fresh pizza bread called 
panini (available only at lunch), and a couple of unmistakable Angeli 
appetizers: croquettes di patate, beautifully fried potato balls with a little 
prosciutto inside; and arancini, much the same made with tomato-flavored rice 
and stuffed with chunks of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
But Nonni does have a soul of its own. Every once in a while there are dishes 
unlike any at Angeli: delicious tiny clams in a white wine, garlic and 
prosciutto sauce that made me wonder why I've never had it before. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of sleek, up-to-date pizzas, like a pizza ai quattro stagioni 
notable for its luscious prosciutto and salami, to say nothing of its 
mushrooms, artichokes, garlic and oregano. One version of calzone is deep-fried 
and looks a little like Mac Tonight's head, with dough that has the texture and 
taste of a beignet. Altogether it's like a gigantic piroshki filled with 
mozzarella, ricotta, salami and tomato-basil sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The pastas are mostly familiar items, but well prepared. Fettuccine Bolognese 
has a meaty sauce made tart with tomatoes, and the lasagne is very 
clean-tasting with veal meatballs, fresh tomato sauce and ricotta. 
</P>
<P>
There's relatively little meat on Nonni's menu, and the predominating flavors 
are probably olives and garlic (spaghetti puttanesca, for instance, is more 
highly flavored with rose olives than red pepper or capers). Seafood gets a 
good shake, though. I've had a terrific entree special of baby salmon fried in 
light batter, mixed with thin slices of marinated eggplant. Another special was 
calamari in clean, crisp breading with one huge shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
There are only three desserts. The most notable is a somewhat soggy tirami su 
with a sharp contrast of flavors: bitter espresso, creamy sweet mascarpone 
cheese and a thin film of chocolate frosting (and some orange flavoring in 
there somewhere). Mille foglia, is in effect a Napoleon, and for once a 
Napoleon with really crisp and flaky pastry. 
</P>
<P>
The original Angeli is fully aware of Osteria Nonni's existence and has even 
been passing out Nonni's business card. This must be part of the reason why 
Nonni is doing so well that even without a freezer, it can offer four or five 
seafood dishes even on a Sunday night. If you don't know where Atwater is, 
you'd better find out. 
</P>
<P>
Osteria Nonni, 3219 Glendale Blvd., Atwater. (213) 666-7133. Lunch Monday 
through Friday, dinner daily. Beer and wine. Street parking. No credit cards. 
Dinner for two, food only, $18 to $36.

MOVABLE FEASTS: POSITIVELY 4TH STREET POSITIVELY WORTH A TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L. N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I don't know whether it's these stuttering earthquakes or too many overcast 
days but my curmudgeon quotient has hit an all-time February high. So when I 
went to check out Positively 4th Street on a positively busy stretch of, yes, 
4th Street in Santa Monica, and saw that it was in the middle of a no-parking 
zone, I bristled at having to park (perish the thought) half a block away. 
</P>
<P>
Since this deli/restaurant/take-out/catering establishment looks rather 
anonymous from the outside, I was about as pleased as Punch and Judy to find a 
smart, changing-weekly menu packed full of inviting things to eat: Freshly made 
caponata. Thai-roasted chicken breast. Pan Bagna. Flourless chocolate cupcakes. 
Homemade soup. 
</P>
<P>
While it may have been the effects of Positively's pink neon lighting 
(identical, no doubt, to the lamps scientists are using to combat that winter 
light deprivation disorder, SAD), I think my mood changed when I tried the 
homemade vegetable soup, a rich, dark, distinct chorus of pureed herbs and 
roots ($2 a cup, $3.25 a bowl). 
</P>
<P>
There are usually eight or nine cold salads to choose from, available by weight 
or by the plate. Served with green salad and pesto-smothered bread, two salads 
are $5.95; four cost $8.25. Thai noodle salad is a bounty full of peanuts and 
sesame seeds; caponata (really just chunks of eggplant with capers without the 
usual red peppers or tomatoes) is freshly sauteed and pleasantly oily. The 
cooks seem to have an affinity bordering on addiction for minced red onion. 
They turn up over and over again but happen to work well in the lush German 
potato salad accented with well-smoked bacon. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe-style black beans and the lentil salad, despite their onions, are 
blandsville. The southern French pan bagna ($5.25), a wonderful crusty slab of 
bread piled high with good tuna, olives, egg, capers, and, natch, minced red 
onion, makes a swell lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Hot platters include crisp, smooth, oniony crab cakes, and a honey of a moist 
ginger-flecked Thai roast chicken breast (both are $7.25). Large ravioli 
stuffed with ricotta and ground walnuts are a subtle delight, bathed in a thin 
slip of lemon-zested vodka cream. 
</P>
<P>
Just when I thought the curmudgeon in me had taken a walk, the voice rose again 
from the deep. "Well," it said, sounding just like Jack Benny, "the only time 
they're open for dinner is on Friday nights." And some of the best desserts are 
gone if you get there too late. But if you get there too early, not all of the 
salads are ready to go. Even if I do concede that the "spa special" (poached 
baby salmon) was certainly moist, would you ever want that nondescript red bell 
pepper sauce again? 
</P>
<P>
Then I tasted Positively's superbly tender grilled swordfish with its quiet 
orange-cilantro butter sheen, a glorious cheesecake with crunchy brownie crust 
and a completely delicious, flourless, serious-chocolate cupcake. 
</P>

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: COOL, CASUAL ORSO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Please welcome the newest restaurant on Los Angeles' newest restaurant row. 
It's called Orso, and it's at 8706 W. 3rd St., in the same block as Ma Be and 
just down the street from Locanda Veneta. The phone number is (213) 274-7144. 
</P>
<P>
Orso occupies the site of the former Joe Allen, but you'd hardly recognize the 
place. It's turned into a cool, casual place that does this burgeoning 
restaurant area proud. There's a gorgeous pink marble floor in the entrance, 
mismatched (and extremely uncomfortable) chairs, all the airs of a true Italian 
trattoria. There is also a very hip menu that changes daily. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the dishes we tried were wonderful: an appetizer of tripe stewed with 
plum tomatoes and kidney beans; veal with pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes and 
olives; a plate of salami, gorgonzola and grilled asparagus. And some were not 
so wonderful, most notably the pasta which was strangely doughy. 
</P>
<P>
The biscotti with vin santo make a swell dessert -- and if you're in the mood, 
you can finish off with a glass of grappa. Orso (the word is Italian for 
"bear," but the restaurant is actually named after a dog that used to stand 
outside of Harry's Bar), is a nice addition to the area -- and one which will 
undoubtedly make all the people who can't get into Locanda Veneta extremely 
happy. RUTH REICHL

GUITARIST KENNY BURRELL TYPICALLY FINE AT BILTMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the great pleasures of hearing a performer like Kenny Burrell is the 
opportunity to experience a few moments with the persistent vitality of 
contemporary jazz history. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening set at the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Ave. Bar on Tuesday night, 
Burrell made the most of a brief but effective four-tune program, adroitly 
demonstrating the skills that have made him a poll-winning, world-class 
guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
Still smarting from the freeway frantics when he dashed on stage, Burrell 
needed a few moments to get his musical energies properly focused. By the time 
he dug into Duke Pearson's "Jeannine," the fingers and the strings were in 
full-fledged harmony. He played a typically hard-driving, melodically 
articulate improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
"My One and Only Love" was even better. Burrell has always been a stunning 
performer of ballads, and his first chorus was a lovely example of how to 
juxtapose rich chording against a sweeping lead line. Pianist Llew Matthews, 
dependable for the entire set, matched Burrell's creative voltage. 
</P>
<P>
The final piece, "Love For Sale," was taken at the kind of rapid clip that 
separates casual players from serious ones. With Sherman Ferguson's drums and 
Richard Reid's bass laying down an irresistible forward momentum, Burrell took 
off on his finest solo of the evening, soaring over the chord changes with the 
effortless grace of a butterfly on the crest of a spring zephyr. 
</P>
<P>
The program was short, but sweet, with Burrell providing enduring testimony to 
the life and creativity that persists in classic modern jazz. DON HECKMAN

A 10-year overview of Carlos Almaraz's paintings and works on paper tells us 
there's an indelibly Latino component to Los Angeles with all the primitive, 
mystical, raunchy, street-wise spirituality that implies. In his capacity to 
log this mix with uncompromising artistry, Almaraz is unique. 
</P>
<P>
The ponderous but nubile figuration in "Dunce's Dream" or "The Clock Said 
Three" recalls Almaraz's study of Mayan and other primitive ruins. The L.A. 
landscape is celebrated in the electric, museum-quality panel painting "Echo 
Park," in a small car crash that explodes beyond its edges and in teetering 
downtown buildings fueled by animate energy. Over the years Almaraz has merged 
many sources to coin his own recognizable iconography, as in the little ships 
that stand for spirits and hover around a harlequin deity in the charming "All 
the Ships That Sailed Before Us" or the floating blue horses that transport 
animal men to dream worlds in "Bug Man." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Almaraz exerts complete control over paint and pigments applied with 
lightning bold strokes in colors that run from the earthen tones of zarapes to 
neon pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable new works show a darker, more brooding art than we're used to from 
him. His usual whimsical sensuality is replaced by something stalking and 
dangerous ("City Cougar" and "The Green One"). Works such as "Philosophical 
Humor" and "Don't Look Back" seem for the first time to consider not the myth 
of afterlife but the tangible presence of mortality. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 
Melrose Ave., to March 4.) MARLENA DONOHUE

Edward Ruscha's idiosyncratic wit and wordplay are in fine working order in a 
selection of his paintings from the '80s. During the past decade, he has 
increasingly allowed words and imagery to carry his encoded messages rather 
than the actual look of the lettering -- which used to preoccupy him so much 
back in the days of bon mots in egg yolk and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
In "Strong, Healthy," for example, there are no visible words at all, just two 
silhouetted houses under a night sky. White bars underneath the houses (the 
longer one under the larger house) conflate this cozy image of suburbia with 
the cold measuring instruments of a marketing survey -- perhaps for an 
insurance company or a bank likely to use the title words in an ad. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a potentially troubling side to the paintings that deal with 
socially and racially charged topics. Ruscha's deadpan delivery leaves itself 
open to being misread as smugly ethnocentric. 
</P>
<P>
"Words of Wisdom" folds a reference to growing Japanese business interests in 
the States into a fortune cookie-style motto. In block letters over a swatch of 
Japanese calligraphy brushed on a sunset sky, the words read: "When buying taxi 
cab company always leave seller with one to drive." The point is probably that 
the old America-the-powerful tables have been turned by foreign investors, but 
the phrase sounds too Charlie Chan-like for comfort. (James Corcoran Gallery, 
1327 5th St., to March 11.)CATHY CURTIS

Anne Marie Karlsen's ceramic vessels and photo-collage paintings make for a 
whirling maelstrom of images and rich color tackling the interconnectedness of 
life. Her ceramic bowls in particular are fascinating objects that seem to have 
pulled themselves into a spiraling whole from the wet compost of a leaf-strewn 
gutter or a deep-sea whirlpool. The vessels are most effective when Karlsen 
lets the limp and glistening forms that swirl around the inside of the bowls 
remain ambiguous. In that state they are able to suggest pieces of clothing, 
centipedes, viscera and female genitalia in what amounts to a romantic melding 
of fragments of fertility. 
</P>
<P>
But Karlsen has a tendency to want to make her meaning inescapable. She pounds 
on an idea such as the cyclical nature of the spiral until redundancy saps the 
poetry and turns the work into a didactic illustration. She decorates some 
bowls with innumerable circular diagrams, or sets planets at the bottom of the 
spinning vortex in case you missed the association. This heavy handedness is 
most strongly felt in the painted photo-collage images with their repetitive 
central heart or womb shape surrounded by fossils that become planets, then 
become leaping fish and then turn into nuclear missiles launched at sea. 
Karlsen mixes the magazine imagery with the air-brushed and painterly areas 
very effectively, but perhaps because such cosmic meaning is expressed in such 
straightforward terms the montage paintings have the descriptive simplicity of 
a Sunday school assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately it is the vessels that make the most eloquent statement. They allow 
the earthiness of the clay to create a metaphor for the creative primordial 
ooze by alluding to the visceral connectedness of nature and the human body.

Ron Linden's new pieces take the solid roundness of a circle and whittle away 
at it from the sides leaving the remainder to ruminate on ideas of wholeness. 
</P>
<P>
Several consist of one unpainted round wood panel cleanly sliced through by 
partial ellipses. The remaining flat shape resembles the head of a two-sided 
ax. 
</P>
<P>
Each orb speaks in emblematic, even heraldic terms about monumentality and 
completeness. We wind up considering the significance of sliced-out sections in 
pieces such as "Study for Deadwood" or casting their absence in symbolic light, 
as in the political eulogy of "Rally." 
</P>
<P>
Linden's work, with its manipulation of abstract, private symbols is 
intellectually complex and often hard to penetrate. In good post-modern 
tradition the objects reveal themselves to be involved in a self-conscious kind 
of discussion that states "I'm making art that talks about art, even while it 
deals with other issues." Where this work proves most enlightening is in its 
exploration of perceived wholeness. The circle is used as both an opening and a 
passing phase of openness -- framing and fragmenting constructed reality.

NEXUS PERCUSSION QUINTET AT MUSEUM

<TEXT>
<P>
The latest Monday Evening Concert in Bing Theater at the County Museum of Art 
hosted the Canadian percussion ensemble Nexus -- Bob Becker, William Cahn, 
Robin Engelman, Russell Hartenberger and John Wyre -- in a varied yet tidy 
program of ragtime, film music, arrangements of African music and contemporary 
works. 
</P>
<P>
The slick, energetic presentation displayed an eclectic grab bag of virtuosic 
styles and tastes. Weightiness was avoided, the ensemble opting for light 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The only exception was Toru Takemitsu's very serious, enigmatic "Rain 
Tree"(1981) for two marimbas, vibraphone and crotales. Becker, Hartenberger and 
Engelman approached the music with the required delicacy, exchanging simple 
pitch materials back and forth, and ending with a longer, more complex unison 
melody. 
</P>
<P>
Becker proved an adept master of mallets not only with Takemitsu's central 
vibraphone part but also with a set of rapid, showy ragtime etudes for the 
xylophone by George Hamilton Green, with marimba accompaniment arranged by Cahn 
and Becker. Becker's talents were again showcased with a slowly unfolding, 
engaging mbira solo in a set of arrangements of African folk songs. 
</P>
<P>
Other African arrangements included a somber funeral song and an improvisatory 
"FraFra," a rhythmic pattern used in drum music from northern Ghana. Engelman's 
work on Lapland flute and Cahn's on toy panpipe added a less convincing element 
to the otherwise intoxicating drum rhythms by other Nexus members. 
</P>
<P>
The evening ended with a screening of Mack Sennett's silent film classic "Teddy 
at the Throttle" (1916). 
</P>
<P>
Here, Cahn arranged a flashy, nostalgic film score utilizing Nexus' full forces 
-- performed live -- and some otherwise forgetable turn-of-the-century film 
music. GREGG WAGER

AMERICAN RETROSPECTIVE AT SCHOENBERG HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faculty and students joined forces at Schoenberg Hall Wednesday night for a 
highly eclectic concert of older -- and brand-new -- American music. This 
despite the fact that the evening was part of the current "Retrospective" 
festival of American music at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
While the performances were essentially first-rate and sensitive, not all of 
the music can be said to have warranted such dedication. Thomas Hilbish led the 
UCLA Concert Choir in Alden Ashforth's Three Motets (1980). Effective in its 
opening cumulative whispering, but less so in its aleatoric moments, the choir 
managed some warmly expressive singing when required. 
</P>
<P>
In all respects the highlight of the evening was "Lovers" by Ned Rorem (1964). 
Cellist Nils Oliver admirably sustained the sumptuous lyricism of its 10 brief 
movements, and his colleagues in the colorfully scored work (harpsichord, 
oboe/English horn and percussion) both matched this quality and provided all 
the other elements called for in this compelling piece. 
</P>
<P>
A quartet of faculty brass players essayed Gunther Schuller's "Little Brass 
Music" (1963). All brass, yes, but unfortunately little music in the literal 
sense as well. Nevertheless, the performers accorded it the same care as they 
did the world premiere of Mark Carlson's "Desire," which added a taped 
synthesized part to the ensemble effort. Its few promising moments were 
overshadowed by a regrettable tendency to vacillate between expressive 
abstractionism and a jarringly inconsistent populist style. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Winter and Kari Windingstad concluded this melting pot of a concert with 
a selection of 19th-Century salon songs. Mixing such chestnuts as "After the 
Ball" and "I Love You Truly" with early examples of true American art song, the 
duo proved stylish and committed. GREG HETTMANSBERGER

BROWN LEADS ACADEMY OF ST. MARTIN-IN-THE-FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iona Brown directed another of her ensembles, a core string contingent from 
London's Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, on Wednesday at Ambassador 
Auditorium in what the headline writers used to call a varied program. Veteran 
observers might, rather, refer to it as a tour program: one in which the 
players trot out well-worn favorites, covering a variety of stylistic bases, 
inviting you to compare their way with them to everybody else's. Musical 
comparison-shopping, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Brown elicits from the Academy a leaner, more pointed sound than that of her 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Still, a common attention to detail provides 
similarities, having largely to do with homogeneity and balance. These Brown 
obtains by refinements of ensemble preparation outside the realm of big-band 
conductors: e.g., the uniform amount of bow used by each player and the care 
lavished on the violas, whose relatively frail tone simply drops out of the 
sonic picture when not attended to. It should be noted that the Academy's 
matched pair, Anthony Jenkins and Robert Smissen, "sounded" splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's program offered the D-minor Concerto from Vivaldi's "L'Estro 
armonico" and the Bach E-major Violin Concerto, both with Brown the commanding, 
fluent soloist; Janacek's early, uncharacteristic and soporific (pace Andrew 
Shulman's sweetly sensitive cello solo) Suite for Strings; Britten's "Simple 
Symphony" (in need of a long holiday); and, most enliveningly, Stravinsky's 
hazard-strewn Concerto in D for Strings, its rhythmic complexities and tenuous 
balances more nearly conquered in the Academy's wittily insinuating 
interpretation than by any one else and at any time within memory.HERBERT GLASS

Corp. of America, $99.95 each. Information: (213) 835-6177. 
</P>
<P>
The latest installments in the "Visual Pathfinders" series focus on the work of 
two of the seminal artists in the history of animation. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pioneers of non-objective film making, Oskar Fischinger (1900-1967) 
worked in a variety of media, including charcoal on paper, cels, clay, cut-outs 
and oil paint on glass. In his films, abstract, geometric forms move with an 
enchanting grace that feels utterly natural. A portfolio of his paintings 
enables the viewer to compare Fischinger's filmic works with his still 
canvases, using the laser disc's single-frame capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The husband-and-wife team of Alexander Alexeieff (1901-1982) and Claire Parker 
(1906-1981) invented the pinscreen, a perversely difficult technique that 
involves manipulating the shadows of thousands of tiny steel pins to form 
patterns reminiscent of charcoal drawings. (A short documentary included on the 
disc demonstrates the technique.) The couple's somber, atmospheric 
interpretation of Moussorgsky's "Night on Bald Mountain" (1933) offers a 
striking contrast to the familiar version in Walt Disney's "Fantasia." CHARLES

PREVIEW: ASSEMBLING MEANING IN PLATT GALLERY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
No loose object is safe whenever sculptor Sylvia Raz walks into a room. 
Interesting doorknobs, chair legs, anything with a fetching shape or texture 
can end up in her assemblage sculptures of painted wood. 
</P>
<P>
Since she was a child, Raz could see sometimes frightening figures in the curve 
of a wall or the most abstract pictures. "What I do now is find discarded items 
with completely other meanings and give them new life," Raz says. 
</P>
<P>
Her wood sculptures, painted either all white or in vivid primary colors, are 
huge -- the largest is eight feet tall. They will be on display beginning 
Sunday at the University of Judaism's Platt Gallery. These works, often 
described as whimsical, are the most recent phase in Raz's work as a sculptor. 
For many years she worked only in stone. 
</P>
<P>
"Those were pieces that expressed a lot of pain -- they were sad," she says of 
the stone carvings she did for 10 years. "I overcame that period, though, and 
went into being more myself; I can let out more humor now." 
</P>
<P>
Raz, who grew up in Uruguay, immigrated to Israel in 1963, where she lived for 
11 years with her husband and four children before coming to Los Angeles. Until 
moving here, Raz was a psychiatric nurse. But she was desperately in need of an 
outlet to vent her feelings about the political struggles that she'd lived 
through in Israel and her homeland. "I decided to go back to my childhood love, 
which was art." 
</P>
<P>
"I deal with myself, women, war, poverty -- issues that touch my soul," she 
says. One wood sculpture, called Venus of Cancer, is Raz's comment on breast 
cancer, using the famous Venus de Milo statue as inspiration. "My children told 
me, 'Mom, you're showing things people don't want to see.' But I don't care, 
and a lot of my work does make people smile. It's attractive, not ugly -- I 
don't like ugly work." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the exhibit are paintings by Brian May, based on the cities of refuge 
described in the Old Testament book of Joshua, and works by Laurel Paley, who 
uses broad, calligraphic strokes -- a tiny scrawl and layers of colors in 
abstract drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Recent Works of Brian May, Laurel Paley and Sylvia Raz" opens with a 
reception from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Platt Gallery of the University 
of Judaism, 15600 Mulholland Drive, Bel-Air. The exhibit runs through March 20. 
Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 2 
p.m. Fridays. There is no charge. Call (213) 476-9777. LAURIE OCHOA

ELAYNE BOOSLER MAKES FUNNY 'CALL' ON CABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of Elayne Boosler's dumpy bottom as she pads along her bachelorette 
apartment in search of something to eat tells us a great deal of the lorn 
condition of the single woman waiting for Mr. Right. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Call," which airs tonight at 9:30 on Cinemax, Boosler plays a 
30-year-old New York career woman named Samantha who decides to pig out to 
perdition before she'll give in to phoning the man who's supposed to call her 
for a date. Her nightmarish anxiety grows to feverish proportion. She awakes to 
find herself transformed into a huge cockroach. 
</P>
<P>
"The Call" is, of course, a comic parable on self-loathing drawn from Kafka's 
"Metamorphosis," and although Boosler has overextended herself as writer, 
director and actress (the short movie has the clunky fitfulness of an 
experimental student film), she's often touching and almost always funny in it 
(as a giant cockroach, what do you wear to the supermarket when you want to buy 
cake? A drape that looks like a huge babuschka). 
</P>
<P>
The writing is adroit and often smart (particularly in a restaurant scene with 
two girlfriends and an obtuse waiter), though a saxophone-playing doppelganger 
hovers in almost every scene like a self-consciously hip '50s artifact. 
</P>
<P>
The ending is not Kafkaesque. It is -- dare we suggest? -- Booslerian. That is 
to say, one must always live in hope. There's an affecting moral too, which 
strongly implies that the ache of loneliness can be a source of strength in 
recognizing the loneliness in others, however well disguised. 
</P>
<P>
It's a rare work that can be both funny and wise. LAWRENCE CHRISTON

'JAZZ MESSENGER' LACKS A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scheduled as it is on KCET Channel 28 at 11 tonight right after a rerun of the 
magnificent two-hour documentary "A Duke Named Ellington," the hourlong program 
entitled "Art Blakey: The Jazz Messenger" will come as an anti-climax. 
</P>
<P>
The fault is not Blakey's, but that of the film makers. Not a single piece of 
music runs its course without interruption in this farrago of voice-overs and 
on-camera colloquy. Many of the speakers are unidentified; some are no doubt 
well-known Blakey alumni, while others, presumably fans, have Cockney accents 
(the film was made mainly in Britain). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who watches the show hoping to hear the veteran drummer play a concert 
with his band will find, instead, a mishmash of aborted performances, 
rehearsals and less-than-enlightening commentary, the best of which is supplied 
by Dizzy Gillespie. There are a few admirable passages from some of Blakey's 
early hits, played by trumpeter Terence Blanchard and other recent members, but 
these two are cut short. 
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate that admirers of the Messengers can hear Blakey and his current 
septet in person at Catalina's in Hollywood, where they will be on hand through 
Sunday, without voice-overs. Here is an outstanding example of live music 
beating out the ersatz taped product. Meanwhile, the definitive documentary on 
this jazz giant has yet to be produced. LEONARD FEATHER

BAKER'S HECTIC NATO TRIP HELPS SET UP PERSONAL TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BRUSSELS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If it's Thursday, this must be Belgium. Or the Netherlands. Or maybe 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
For the better part of a week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been 
dashing across Europe on a grueling schedule, visiting 14 countries at a pace 
of three or four a day. The idea, Baker explained, was to show the United 
States' North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies that the Bush Administration 
cares about them -- and to give the new secretary "a chance to establish a 
personal relationship" with his European counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The device of touching down in every NATO country -- including tiny Iceland and 
Luxembourg -- was pure Jim Baker, his aides noted. The secretary of state is 
the same student of political symbolism (and airborne campaigning) who helped 
Ronald Reagan and George Bush win three presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's odyssey has found Western Europe, long taken for granted as the United 
States' premier ally, to be up for grabs again; the Bush Administration will 
have to accord to the future of Europe as much attention as it may have been 
ready to pay the Soviet Union, the Middle East and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
And it has provided a first glimpse of Baker as secretary of state: a canny 
politician-turned-diplomat who is likely to be as activist -- and as secretive 
-- as any since Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
How well Baker's opening gambit is working, however, is another question. Not 
surprisingly, the secretary's aides say his maiden voyage has been a smashing 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every single meeting . . . has started by an expression of appreciation 
for his doing this," said a senior official who accompanied Baker. "They have 
all acknowledged that this kind of a trip is backbreaking. . . . They know it 
is unusual. They know it is hard." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most countries went beyond the requirements of protocol, setting up 
meetings for Baker with their prime ministers rather than just his counterparts 
at the foreign ministries. Two, Belgium and Luxembourg, even produced their 
heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, Baker was flown by helicopter to Chequers, the prime minister's 
country house, for Sunday lunch with a Margaret Thatcher clearly anxious to 
continue the special relationship with Washington she enjoyed in Reagan's day. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Iceland and Norway, rarely favored with visits by top U.S. 
officials, were clearly impressed by Baker's two-hour stopovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's an important start for a new Administration," said Norway's 
prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, beaming. 
</P>
<P>
But in West Germany, where the Bush Administration has been pressuring the Bonn 
government on arms control issues, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was 
polite but stone-faced when Baker flew in. And in Ankara, a Turkish official, 
asked whether Baker's visit had made a big impression, shrugged dismissively. 
</P>
<P>
'Your secretaries of state all come about once a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and his aides said they were delighted at the expressions of fidelity to 
the 16-nation Western Alliance that they heard at every stop. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard an awful lot of expressions not only of good will, but of a strong 
commitment to new partnership, greater cooperation, greater solidarity, greater 
unity," said a senior aide. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the customary talk of unity, there were also polite disagreements. 
The West Germans and Italians pressed for NATO discussions of negotiations to 
reduce the number of short-range nuclear missiles in Europe, a subject that the 
Bush Administration would prefer to avoid. The British asked for an easing of 
curbs on high-technology exports to the Soviet Union. The Greeks restated their 
intention of closing U.S. bases on their soil. NATO, one American diplomat was 
quoted as saying, is beginning to sound like "a badly rehearsed orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
Underlying at least some of the cacophony is the belief of many Europeans that 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is serious about eliminating the Soviet 
military threat to Western Europe. Since Gorbachev's announcement in December 
that the Soviet Union will unilaterally withdraw six tank divisions from the 
Continent, public opinion, especially in West Germany, has increasingly 
questioned the need for more military spending. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an impression there that if the Cold War is over and there's no 
threat, then why spend on defense?" a State Department official said. "It 
erodes the credibility of NATO." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be More Pressing 
</P>
<P>
If Baker learned anything on his wearying passage through 15 capitals, 
including Ottawa before Europe, it may be that the very basis of NATO's 
existence can no longer be taken for granted -- and that the issue may be more 
pressing than he realized. 
</P>
<P>
"You can read all the (State Department) papers . . . but when you go into a 
room with people who have these problems on a daily basis, it's much more 
immediate," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Several veteran diplomats gave Baker high marks for swiftly and deftly 
cementing bilateral relationships with each of the 15 allies. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a political animal, and these foreign ministers are all politicians," 
commented one aide. "He understands their needs." 
</P>
<P>
Baker has long been known for preparing almost obsessively for important 
meetings, and aides said he devoured thick briefing books before every stop on 
his trip. Whatever the method, he discoursed fluently on local concerns in 15 
capitals, from Aegean Sea armaments (in Turkey) to ground-water pollution 
around NATO air bases (in Iceland). 
</P>
<P>
He also turned on his Texas lawyer's charm at every stop, lauding his hosts or 
their devotion to the alliance and recalling, in a down-home way, his previous 
visits to their country -- as a Reagan aide, as a tourist or even, in Greece, 
as a U.S. Marine on shore leave in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
The trip, Baker's first as secretary of state, was something of a shakedown 
cruise. Baker and his closest aides, including several from the tightly knit 
group who have worked for him since he was White House chief of staff in the 
first Reagan Administration, are still getting used to the State Department and 
its slightly foreign ways. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the number of cables that they send to us," said one 
awe-struck aide. "We get through our meetings at midnight, we read until 2 in 
the morning and then we're up again at 6." 
</P>
<P>
While some of his aides looked noticeably rumpled and red-eyed as the week of 
six-meeting days wore on, Baker managed somehow to look crisp and fresh at 
every stop, even though he has said that he dreads such long trips because of 
the jet lag. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing better than he usually does," said his wife, Susan, who also came 
on the trip -- but skipped a few of the more arduous days. 
</P>
<P>
So rapid-fire was Baker's schedule that some of his one-on-one meetings lasted 
only 20 minutes -- a pace which did not prevent him, in Lisbon, from extolling 
what he called an "extended discussion" with Portugal's foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's famous self-discipline was evident, too. Walking out of royal palaces, 
ancient parliaments and modern office buildings in city after city, he 
responded to reporters' questions with a tight smile and a stock response: "We 
discussed a wide range of East-West issues." 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the journey, criticism in Washington over Baker's holding 
millions of dollars worth of stock in Chemical New York Corp. -- a banking 
company with billions in Third World loans -- prompted the secretary of state 
to announce that he would sell all publicly held stocks in his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said it was a painful decision -- the Chemical stock derived from 
holdings in a bank that Baker's grandfather founded, and its sale was expected 
to cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes. But Baker betrayed no 
concern over the issue before he made his decision, and said nothing about it 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's aides did, however, give away one small sign of 
frailty in their otherwise ascetic chief. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening, they said, he took a single vodka martini.

PROFITS FROM REFERRALS;

<P>
DOCTORS' USE OF OWN LABS: GOOD ETHICS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors at the Woodbridge Medical Center in Irvine used to refer patients who 
needed X-rays to a separate clinic in the same building. But now, even though 
sophisticated imaging techniques such as ultrasounds and mammograms are still 
readily available, clinic personnel say patients are no longer beating a path 
to their door. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the doctors are instead sending patients down the street to a new 
medical imaging center -- a facility owned by the physicians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to believe," said Dr. Robert Benson, a radiologist at the Woodbridge 
clinic that is losing patients to the new facility, "that if you gave good 
service, had lower fees and provided TLC to doctors and patients, you'd do 
fine. But I see now that money is thicker than blood. It's unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Stakes 
</P>
<P>
Whether it is a radiology lab, sports medicine clinic or physical therapy 
center, it is increasingly likely -- especially in California -- that doctors 
have financial stakes in such outpatient facilities, and refer their patients 
there for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
From these ventures, they often realize substantial extra income. In setting up 
the clinics, said Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), some entrepreneurs have offered 
doctors returns on their investments of more than 100% a year. 
</P>
<P>
To a growing chorus of critics, these entanglements pose a conflict of interest 
for doctors, jeopardize patient care, undercut honest competition and increase 
health care costs. "The trend toward arrangements whereby physicians are given 
an economic inducement to make particular referral decisions is to be deplored 
and should be rejected in strong terms," the prestigious Institute of Medicine, 
part of the National Academy of Sciences, has declared. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wrong, it's unethical and it's not in the public interest," Dr. Arnold 
Relman, editor of the distinguished New England Journal of Medicine, said of 
the investments. "Basically, we're talking about a kickback or a bribe that has 
so far avoided existing regulations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Survey of Doctors 
</P>
<P>
Relman estimated, based on a recent survey of doctors by the American Medical 
Assn., that 50,000 to 75,000 physicians nationwide have a financial interest in 
ancillary health care services. 
</P>
<P>
Stark last week reintroduced federal legislation, the Ethics in Patient 
Referral Act of 1989, that would bar physicians from referring Medicare 
patients to clinics the physicians own. The Consumer Federation of America and 
17 other groups have announced their support for the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Assn., which opposes Stark's legislation, asserts that it 
is unfair to bar doctors from investing in things they know best, especially 
because their financial involvement in a facility will be likely to ensure 
better quality care and service. In some cases, AMA officials say, a clinic 
could not have been financed or built but for local doctors who were willing to 
make an often-risky investment. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, health care attorneys are anticipating a legislative crackdown and 
recently staged symposiums in Los Angeles and San Francisco to alert the 
medical community to the far-reaching implications of the bill and other 
measures that target business deals involving physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"This issue is on the cutting edge," attorney Carl Weissburg told a Los Angeles 
symposium that attracted about 400 people. He and other speakers distributed a 
200-page book that examines the legality of business arrangements under the 
Stark bill. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the debate is an axiom of health care, the notion that patients 
generally trust and expect their doctors to refer them to the best-quality, 
best-priced, most convenient clinic available. 
</P>
<P>
But Stark contends that physicians' judgments in making referrals could well be 
colored by their personal financial stake in the decision. For example, he told 
Congress that he has learned of cases where cancer patients have been sent for 
daily radiation therapy to clinics 20 miles away from their homes, rather than 
being referred to another closer, equally qualified treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everyone Knows' 
</P>
<P>
By law, a physician's return on his investment in a clinic is not supposed to 
be tied to the number of patients he refers. "But everyone knows that the more 
referrals made, the higher the profits," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a mammography clinic in Los Gatos, Calif., which sent its 
physician-investors their checks along with a letter reciting the number of 
referrals each physician had made to the clinic. Those who had ordered fewer 
than 10 mammograms, which detect breast irregularities, were encouraged "to 
increase their referrals." The letter, which Stark provided to The Times, 
pointed out, "The realization of the long-term goal of this partnership is the 
responsibility of each one of us." 
</P>
<P>
Because doctors control patient referrals, Stark said, they can lock up the 
market and drive independent providers out of business. "We have received 
hundreds of letters of support from independent providers who feel their 
survival is threatened by this trend," Stark said." 
</P>
<P>
Benson, at the Irvine radiology clinic, said, "I believe in competition, but 
the deck shouldn't be stacked." A spokesman for the nearby competing doctors' 
clinic did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles radiologist, who declined to comment on the record for fear of 
being ostracized by the medical community on which he depends for referrals, 
said several diagnostic imaging centers in his area have "locked in" physicians 
as owners who refer patients there for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not compete with them," he said. "There's no way to compete except to 
bribe." 
</P>
<P>
The American College of Radiology has voiced support for curbs on physician 
ownership of referral services. The practice, said Tom Greeson, general 
counsel, is sweeping the country "like an epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
"A promoter can just sign up a bunch of doctors and cut other people out of the 
market," said Dr. Stephen Bandeian, staff aide to the House health subcommittee 
that Stark chairs. 
</P>
<P>
He said the "hot areas" for this activity are X-ray clinics, particularly the 
lucrative high-technology imaging centers that provide costly magnetic 
resonance imaging known as MRI's and CT-scans. Other popular areas for 
investment, he said, have been physical therapy centers, sports medicine 
clinics, laboratories that test blood and measure cholesterol levels, as well 
as companies that provide home health care services and durable medical 
equipment supplies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advanced Marketplace 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California is one of the most advanced marketplaces in the country 
for this kind of thing," Bandeian said. 
</P>
<P>
The AMA recently questioned about 900 physicians and reported that California, 
Arizona and Florida had the highest concentration of physicians who own and 
refer patients to outpatient clinics -- 12% compared to the national average of 
6%. These three states were grouped together for analysis becauses they all 
have laws requiring physicians to disclose their financial interest in a clinic 
to all their patients -- not just those insured through the federal Medicare 
program. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no other formal tally of the number of physicians who refer 
patients to clinics they own but two government studies are under way. In the 
meantime, several spot studies have suggested that the services of 
physician-owned laboratories are over-utilized and more expensive than others. 
</P>
<P>
A 1984 study by Blue Cross in Michigan, for example, found that the average 
charge per patient and average number of tests per patient were nearly double 
for the physician-owned labs in the sample. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites Competition 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Johnson Lightfoote, a general partner in Diagnostic Imaging of Southern 
California in Sherman Oaks, asserted that his clinic competes on the basis of 
"service, quality and price." While the clinic is owned largely by physicians, 
he said that not all of them make referrals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one doctor who has sent zero cases in four years," he said. "One guy 
down the street sends four cases a day." 
</P>
<P>
A physician's return on his investment is totally independent of the number of 
patients he refers, Lightfoote said. During the last five years, the return on 
investment has averaged a meager 3.5%, he added. 
</P>
<P>
As for other clinics that find it hard to compete, he said, "Yeah. I try to 
make it hard." 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away is another physician-owned diagnostic imaging center, 
Computer Medical Imaging. Dr. Steven Novom, a neurologist and founding partner, 
said he refers about two to four patients there a week. But he said the return 
on his investment is not tied in any way to the number of referrals. He could 
not estimate how profitable the venture has been, but said his return is 
certainly "not 100%." 
</P>
<P>
The center was set up by physicians to fill a void in the community, according 
to Dr. Robert Cohenour, another founding partner. He said hospitals in the 
Valley lack the technology, qualified personnel and motivation to set up 
sophisticated imaging centers, forcing patients to travel to UCLA Medical 
Center for care. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he added, local hospitals have been prodded into action, stimulating 
"healthy competition." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James E. Davis, president of the AMA, said Stark's bill will put an 
unfortunate end to such physician enterprise and innovation. 
</P>
<P>
He said that several years ago he personally joined with 55 other physicians in 
Durham, N.C., to set up an ambulatory surgical center that now provides 
superior and cheaper surgical treatment to patients than is provided by the 
hospital across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James H. Sammons, executive vice president of the AMA, said that as long as 
physicians disclose their financial interest to patients, it is not unethical 
for them to make referrals to facilities they own. 
</P>
<P>
He said there are already "laws on the books" to combat abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law has long prohibited any person -- doctors included -- from 
soliciting or receiving bribes, kickbacks or rebates in return for the referral 
of patients insured through the government-sponsored Medicare or Medicaid 
programs. A spokeswoman for the inspector general's office of the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services said there have been 54 convictions for 
Medicare and Medicaid kickbacks since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, there have been less than half a dozen convictions in the last 
several years, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Brian Hennigan, who specializes in 
health care fraud. But he added that the inspector general's office has called 
his attention to as many as 20 cases a year involving doctors who have invested 
in outpatient services, and "there's a question as to how they're being 
compensated -- whether they're being paid for patients they're sending in." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Hennigan said, he does not prosecute these kinds of cases under the 
federal anti-kickback legislation because the deals are couched in terms that 
make them technically legal. The money a physician gets from the outpatient 
service is not viewed as a kickback for a patient referral, but rather as a 
return on investment, Hennigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Such arrangements involving Southern California doctors "seem to be pretty 
common now," compared to four years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all of the 500,000 doctors out there are saints," Sammons acknowledged, 
"but by and large they have their patients' interest at heart, and for the few 
who misuse the system, they'll misuse anything. That's a tiny, tiny part."

HUMANITARIAN AID PLEDGED BEYOND MARCH 31 CUTOFF

President Bush, in his first public comment on a Central American peace 
initiative that he admitted took him by surprise, promised Thursday that the 
United States would not abandon Nicaragua's Contras or "leave them twisting out 
there" in the face of a plan to disarm them and close their bases. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to a small group of reporters in the Oval Office, Bush pledged to 
continue some form of "humanitarian" assistance to the Contras after the 
current $27-million aid package expires March 31. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that there are both "positive" and "troubling" elements in 
the plan adopted Monday by five Central American presidents, which calls for 
disbanding the Contra military forces in exchange for promises of free 
elections and democratic reforms by Nicaragua's leftist government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'National Reconciliation' 
</P>
<P>
He said that if Managua's Sandinista government keeps its end of the bargain in 
the new peace plan, it would produce the sort of democratic government that the 
Contras have been fighting for. 
</P>
<P>
"They're talking about national reconciliation and full freedoms, including 
complete freedom of the press and free and fair elections and an end to 
subversion," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that the United States will be wary about taking the Nicaraguan 
government at its word because President Daniel Ortega's regime has broken its 
promises before. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's be sure that we not leave the resistance standing alone, leave them 
twisting out there without fulfillment of the commitment to democracy on the 
part of the Sandinistas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kremlin Call Rejected 
</P>
<P>
In the mini-press conference with the reporters, Bush also rejected the Soviet 
Union's renewed call for an embargo on arms shipments to Afghanistan and urged 
Moscow to support a neutral, nonaligned regime in Kabul. He said that 
Washington would continue supplying weapons to the anti-communist moujahedeen 
guerrillas because the Soviet Union turned over to the Marxist government vast 
stockpiles of armaments before the last Soviet troops left the country this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Bush attempted to gloss over a festering dispute between the United States and 
West Germany over North Atlantic Treaty Organization plans to modernize 
battlefield nuclear weapons, maintaining that "we are far closer to West 
Germany than the public perceptions might be." 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government opposes upgrading NATO's short-range nuclear arsenal 
because most of the weapons are deployed in West Germany. Because of the 
weapons' limited range and the country's geographic position at the front-line 
of any East-West conflict, fired missiles would, in the event of war, probably 
land inside West Germany's borders. 
</P>
<P>
"I would use this opportunity to shoot down the concept that there are major 
divisions between ourselves and the Federal Republic (of Germany) on this 
question," Bush said without providing any sort of hint about how the dispute 
would be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras have been camped in bases on the Honduras side of the 
Nicaragua-Honduras border for months, surviving on non-lethal aid voted by 
Congress last year to pay for food, clothing and other supplies. Bush said that 
he is determined to provide some form of aid after the current appropriation 
runs out next month. But he said he had not yet decided how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I have every intention of seeing that these people receive humanitarian 
support, but how that comes about, we'll just have to wait and see," the 
President said. A text of the press conference, which was attended by several 
reporters, was made available later. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration said previously that it will not seek renewed military aid 
for the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, 
Guatemala and Nicaragua calls for drafting, within the next 90 days, a detailed 
plan to disarm the Contras and remove them from the bases in Honduras. The pact 
also calls for free and fair elections in Nicaragua before the end of next 
February, nine months earlier than elections were previously scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that the United States would work during the next 90 days with the 
Central American leaders "to see that there's not just some fluffy promises out 
there, but that there's some teeth in the promise of democratization. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about freedom of the press, freedom of elections, freedom of 
worship," he said. "And it's fine to spell these things out in generalities, 
but now let's get down to how we proceed. What does a free and fair election 
mean? I want to see some certification of the election process." 
</P>
<P>
Bush candidly admitted that he had not expected the Central American presidents 
to act as they did, despite several recent high-level contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have said that they'd do exactly what they did do," he said. "In 
terms of being caught off-guard, we are in the midst of a review of our whole 
policy there."

CLEAN NEEDLE USE MAY BE SLOWING SPREAD OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alarming rate of AIDS virus infection among intravenous drug users in San 
Francisco, New York and several other cities appears to be stabilizing, 
according to surprising new findings that suggest that there may be hope of 
controlling the epidemic in that pivotal group. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said the findings, published in part today in the Journal of the 
American Medical Assn., suggest that it is possible to persuade drug users to 
use clean needles -- and thus perhaps to slow the spread of AIDS among drug 
users, their sexual partners and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts, however, warned against misinterpreting the findings. The 
infection rate may be leveling off in those cities, but users are still 
becoming infected. Some already infected may be dropping out of the groups 
being studied, while new, uninfected users enter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that nobody's getting infected anymore," said Andrew Moss, a UC San 
Francisco epidemiologist studying intravenous drug users in that city. "It's 
that a lot of people have cleaned up their act, and a smaller number of people 
are getting infected." 
</P>
<P>
The study published today by a team of prominent AIDS researchers, tracks the 
once-soaring rise in human immunodeficiency virus infection among drug users in 
Manhattan. It concludes that the infection rate has hovered for the last four 
years between 55% and 60%. 
</P>
<P>
That apparent stabilization is in contrast to the pattern seen in the previous 
five years in the Manhattan study, which involved nearly 700 subjects. The rate 
of infection during that period leaped from 9% in 1978 to 38% in 1980 to 50% in 
1983, the authors calculated based on analysis of stored blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
The leveling off also defies traditional infectious disease patterns, in which 
the increase in the infection rate is highest after half the population becomes 
infected. This pattern has been evident in the case of hepatitis B, which is 
believed to infect 80% to 95% of New York intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly encouraging in the sense that we haven't seen the massive 
explosion continuing," said Samuel Friedman, a researcher with Narcotic and 
Drug Research Inc., a nonprofit group affiliated with the New York State 
Division of Substance Abuse Services. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers suggested that cities such as Los Angeles, with relatively low 
infection rates, could benefit by implementing aggressive AIDS prevention 
programs among drug users -- similar to those that have been in place in San 
Francisco and New York for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The study was headed by Don C. Des Jarlais, AIDS research coordinator in the 
state substance abuse services division. The other co-authors include 
researchers with three large New York City hospitals and the federal Centers 
for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
Similar patterns of relatively stable rates of human immunodeficiency virus 
infection have also begun to emerge in San Francisco, Stockholm and Innsbruck, 
Austria, according to the Manhattan study and AIDS researchers in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
John Watters, a UC San Francisco epidemiologist studying thousands of 
intravenous drug users on the street and entering drug abuse treatment, said in 
an interview that the rate of infection among heterosexual users appears to 
have remained steady at about 14% since early 1987. That rate had jumped from 
below 5% in 1983 to 10% in 1985, according to other studies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Programs 
</P>
<P>
"I think it provides hope that you really can have an effect with this 
population," Watters said. In particular, he pointed to pioneering 
AIDS-education and prevention programs begun in San Francisco in 1986 and 
targeted to intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Watters and others nevertheless cautioned against excessive optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that (the infection rate) is not going down, and there's evidence 
that new infection continues right up to the present, is worrisome," said 
Timothy J. Dondero of the Centers for Disease Control. "If it's stable at a 
relatively high level, that's pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the apparent stabilization are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
One contributing factor may lie in the way studies are designed, relying at 
least in part on drug users entering treatment programs. Some infected users 
drop out of the pool -- because of illness, for example. Although they remain 
infected, they are no longer counted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, new drug users are entering the pool. Chances are, they are not yet 
infected. They would tend to "dilute" the group being studied, helping 
stabilize the infection rate somewhere below 100% saturation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most significantly, the researchers believe that the leveling off 
reflects the fact that some drug users are using needles more safely than in 
the past -- for example, not sharing needles with others and sterilizing their 
equipment with bleach before each use. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said it would behoove cities such as Los Angeles, where the virus 
arrived late among drug users and the infection rate is still low, to take 
advantage of the opportunity to avert a dramatic rise by setting up aggressive 
AIDS prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
"You've (Los Angeles) been lucky. It reached you late," said Friedman. Pointing 
out that the infection rate in Bangkok, Thailand, jumped from 18% to 40% in 
1988 alone, he added, "You've got a moment, maybe, where the dynamics are going 
in your favor." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to educate the estimated 80,000 to 130,000 intravenous drug users in 
Los Angeles County about the risk of spreading infected blood in shared needles 
have been slowed by an official unwillingness to support programs believed to 
have worked in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the five county supervisors voted last August to reject plans to 
distribute bleach kits and condoms to drug users, suggesting that such a 
practice would be immoral. The plan had the backing of the county Department of 
Health Services and the county Commission on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 30 county-financed outreach workers are assigned to educate 
intravenous drug users about AIDS virus transmission and prevention. The county 
also has plans to increase human immunodeficiency virus testing for drug users 
in drug-abuse treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Frangenberg, director of the county AIDS program, said in an interview 
that he agrees with the Manhattan researchers' statement in their study that 
Los Angeles and comparable cities may be facing a prime opportunity to avert a 
dramatic rise in infection. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great preventive health opportunity," Frangenberg said. "If we 
could distribute bleach and condoms and expand the number of people in the 
community providing (AIDS prevention) services, I think that could be helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have developed a molecular picture of an enzyme that the AIDS virus 
needs to grow. (Business, Page 4.)

The U.N. Security Council gave unanimous approval to an independence plan 
designed to free Namibia from 74 years of South African rule, and it dispatched 
the first U.N. peacekeepers to the region. "The decision . . . marks the last 
major step toward decolonization," said Ambassador Jal Pratap Rana of Nepal, 
Security Council president for February. "We look forward to welcoming Namibia 
as a fellow member of this family of nations before long." April 1 was set as 
the date to begin the one-year plan for Namibia's transition to a nation ruled 
by its black majority. The plan also calls for sending 4,650 U.N. peacekeepers, 
500 police supervisors and at least 1,000 election monitors to Namibia.

Surgeons removed tissue from a kidney of deposed Philippine President Ferdinand 
E. Marcos and found that it was benign, sources close to the former president 
said. Marcos, 71, who is recovering from pneumonia and bronchial asthma at St. 
Francis Medical Center in Honolulu, underwent the operation Tuesday after a 
scan of his kidney indicated he might have a tumor, the sources said. U.S. 
intelligence reports released in Washington in 1986 said Marcos had undergone a 
number of kidney transplants but that his body had rejected the organs.

The Duquette Pavilion of St. Francis was badly damaged in a five-alarm fire 
that burned out of control for more than two hours, San Francisco fire 
officials said. The art collection suffered extensive damage in the blaze, said 
Fire Chief Fred Postel. The adjacent old Peoples Temple, operated during the 
70s by the Rev. Jim Jones, suffered extensive water damage but was not burned 
in the blaze. Postel said the roof of the pavilion, owned by San Francisco 
artist Tony Duquette, collapsed about 20 minutes after the department received 
the first reports of the fire. That nearly assured the destruction of its 
extensive collection of tapestries, sculptures, stained glass, paintings, 
objets d'art and an ornate, decorative ceiling. There were no reports of 
injuries.

The International Committee of the Red Cross has suspended an airlift of relief 
supplies to southern Sudan during negotiations with anti-government rebels, a 
spokesman said in Geneva. Relief flights were stopped Tuesday after the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army demanded changes in the Red Cross' notification 
procedure for its flights to a number of cities, spokesman Juerg Bischoff said. 
To ensure safe passage, the Red Cross notifies both the Khartoum government and 
the rebels of all relief flights. Bischoff said the negotiations concern 
"technical issues" and that he expects the airlift, begun Dec. 4, to resume "in 
a matter of days."

The worst flooding in a decade chased thousands of people from their homes in 
central Kentucky as the governor declared a state of emergency and National 
Guardsmen were dispatched into areas swamped by rain-swollen rivers. In 
Tennessee, an earthen dam burst on the rain-swollen Obion River, sending five 
feet of water pouring into two towns and forcing 377 residents in Rives and 
Obion to flee their flooded homes in boats. Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson 
ordered about 100 National Guard troops to help with evacuations as the 
Kentucky River near Frankfort rose nearly 14 feet above flood stage, causing 
2,000 families to flee their homes.

The U.S. Air Force canceled all its air shows in West Germany for 1989, six 
months after the Ramstein Air Base crash that killed 70 people and injured 
hundreds, a military spokesman at the base said. Three Italian stunt jets 
collided in flight over Ramstein on Aug. 28, and one of the flaming planes 
plowed into a crowd of spectators. That crash, and a series of allied training 
flight crashes in West Germany last year that killed more than 100 people, 
caused a public outcry and demands for a stop to low-level military flights.

The federal government curbed the use of a fungicide sprayed on a variety of 
fruits and vegetables but stopped short of banning it outright even though it 
has been classified as probably causing cancer. In announcing the action, the 
Environmental Protection Agency said: "The benefits of some uses of Captan 
outweigh the risk from dietary exposure." The agency said that in the cases 
where the chemical may continue to be used on certain food products the risk of 
a person getting cancer because of such exposure is less than 1 in 1 million. 
The EPA order prohibits the further use of Captan on 42 food products, but 
allows continued use on 24 others, including apples, peaches, cherries, 
lettuce, green onions and tomatoes.

An American search team in the Philippines spotted the wreckage of a missing 
F-16 jet fighter in the mountains north of Manila, but the pilot's fate 
remained unknown. A U.S. Air Force statement said the wreckage was found by 
search planes about 9 miles west of Clark Air Base. The pilot was identified as 
Lt. Josh Levin, 30, of Beverly Hills, Calif., who was assigned to the 8th 
Tactical Fighter Wing based at Kunsan, South Korea. Ground teams expected to 
reach the crash site later today. The plane took off Tuesday from Clark, 50 
miles north of Manila, to take part in exercises but failed to rendezvous with 
other aircraft.

DESPITE RATE HIKE, IT WILL LOSE MONEY, INSURER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A national official of State Farm, defending the company's recently announced 
9.6% average statewide auto insurance rate increase, told a legislative hearing 
Thursday that even after the $149-million increase, the company will still lose 
$124 million on its coverage of private passenger autos in California this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Ingham, general counsel of State Farm, the state's largest auto insurance 
seller with about 2.7 million vehicles covered, said in an interview after 
testifying that the company had not ordered a larger increase now because it 
feared this would inspire more political pressure on state Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to rescind it. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has called a March 20 hearing in San Francisco at which the company 
will be required to justify the 9.6% increase as not excessive under state law. 
In the meantime, the insurer is implementing the increase as it sends out 
policy renewals. 
</P>
<P>
In six months to a year, however, Ingham said in the interview, State Farm will 
have to raise its California auto rates again unless dramatic action is taken 
by the Legislature to hold down rising insurance claims by making changes in 
the civil justice system. 
</P>
<P>
Ingham noted that the increase falls on policyholders unevenly. Those who carry 
only the state-required minimum liability coverage will get a 17% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Ingham testified before the Insurance Committee hearing chaired 
by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys), it was disclosed that another insurer, 
Geico, has raised its auto insurance rates in California. 
</P>
<P>
Geico President Eugene J. Meyung said in a telephone interview that, effective 
Wednesday, the company, which has about 2% of the California auto insurance 
market, began to implement an increase averaging 9.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Meyung said a 13% or 14% increase would have been justified, and he noted that 
his company has ceased selling to new auto insurance customers in California 
because, he said, it is losing money here. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles hearing began with strong criticism against the insurers from 
Robbins, Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and Harvey 
Rosenfield, chairman of the Voter Revolt organization that sponsored 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"At every step, and at every turn, the insurance industry has used and is using 
its formidable resources to thwart, escape and elude Proposition 103 and the 
will of the people," Roberti said, noting that the industry has gone to the 
state Supreme Court in an effort to have rate rollbacks called for under 
Proposition 103 struck down. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield charged that State Farm's rate increase is "the ultimate act of 
thumbing the industry's nose at the people of California," and he urged the 
insurer's customers to take their business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
He also complained about a new national advertising campaign being undertaken 
by the industry against Proposition 103-style price controls and for changes in 
the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
The Proposition 103 chairman cited a published report that the Insurance 
Information Institute, an industry trade group, has plans to spend $93 million 
on the new advertising effort. 
</P>
<P>
But institute spokesman Peter van Aartrijk denied that anywhere near that large 
an amount will be spent. He said that $1 million is going into a series of 
full-page ads in a number of nationally circulated newspapers and that "the 
rest of the campaign has not yet been set." 
</P>
<P>
Another subject of the hearing concerned the insolvency and impending 
liquidation of Coastal Insurance Co., which has served 200,000 California auto 
policyholders, 80% of them in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Harry O. Miller, chief of the company, challenged the assertion made Feb. 3 by 
Gillespie that most of the firm's financial problems revolved around a 
$26-million "illicit dividend" to its parent company, Advent Management. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said there was nothing illicit about it. He said Advent Management, 
which he disclosed will announce its bankruptcy and impending liquidation next 
week, had 1,100 employees who performed all policyholder services for Coastal, 
while Coastal only had six employees. The $26 million that Coastal gave Advent 
was for its services, and now Advent is just as broke as Coastal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, Rosenfield and Steven Miller of the Insurance Consumer Action Network, 
meanwhile, criticized Gillespie at the hearing for refusing to publicly 
disclose rate filings by State Farm and several other companies. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Insurance Commissioner Charlene Mathias said that "in the spirit of 
Proposition 103," Gillespie will release the filings of State Farm next week. 
But until rate regulation provisions of Proposition 103 go into effect next 
November, she said, the department does not think it is legally required to 
release such filings.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS' 'SPECIAL TAX' REMAINS INVALID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The state Supreme Court dealt a setback Thursday to school districts in 
fast-growing communities, limiting their ability to impose special taxes or 
fees on developers to pay the full costs of educational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, over one dissent, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last 
November by a state Court of Appeal that struck down a voter-approved tax of as 
much as $6,300 on each new home built within five districts in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge appeal court held that the tax was invalid either as a "special 
tax" allowed with two-thirds voter approval under Proposition 13 or as a 
"development fee" that schools may impose, but only up to $1.50 a square foot 
of a new residence. 
</P>
<P>
The panel ruled further that the tax was illegal because it was not imposed 
uniformly on residents and property owners throughout the community, but would 
be borne only by developers and future residents. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action, taken in a brief order issued Thursday, means the 
appellate ruling becomes binding on trial courts throughout the state. Only 
Justice Stanley Mosk voted to review the appellate court decision -- leaving 
the matter three votes short of the number required. 
</P>
<P>
The case had drawn wide attention in the wake of a flurry of recent efforts by 
local governmental agencies to impose fees on developers to provide for 
schools, roads and other facilities required by rapid population growth. 
</P>
<P>
While most school districts in the state had abided by the statutory limit on 
developer fees, the effort by the districts in the Santa Clarita Valley to 
impose what they called a "special tax" to obtain far more revenue for 
long-range educational needs could have led to similar moves throughout 
California, lawyers and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
School authorities expressed dismay with the decision, saying it would 
eliminate a once-promising avenue of support for districts hard-pressed to meet 
growing demands. They noted that the $1.50-a-square-foot limitation on fees 
ordinarily would pay only about one-third of the cost of new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply disappointed," said Clayton H. Parker of Santa Ana, one of the 
attorneys for the five districts in the case. "If you can't get local funds 
with a special tax, there will be no place else to turn to but the state." 
</P>
<P>
William Ingram, president of the California School Boards Assn., said school 
authorities from across the state had been hopeful that the appellate court 
ruling would be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back to Drawing Board' 
</P>
<P>
"That would have given us an out," he said. "Now, we're back to the drawing 
board." 
</P>
<P>
On another front, Sonoma County Counsel James P. Botz, representing a coalition 
of 14 counties that supported the five school districts in the case, voiced 
concern that the ruling could encourage legal challenges to a wide range of 
voter-approved, post-Proposition 13 special taxes enacted by cities, counties 
and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
Botz noted, for example, that under the decision a hotel occupancy tax -- borne 
primarily by visitors and not voters -- might face a legal challenge because it 
was not uniformly imposed. 
</P>
<P>
"It could really narrow the kind of taxes that local governments can impose 
under Proposition 13," he said. "Those kind of taxes are difficult enough to 
obtain because they have to be approved by two-thirds of the voters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimal Effect 
</P>
<P>
However, Alvin S. Kaufer, a Los Angeles attorney who represented the California 
Building Industry Assn. in a suit against the tax at issue in the case, said 
the ruling would have minimal impact, affecting only a relatively small number 
of school districts that have tried to impose a special revenue measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal opinion, he added, stopped far short of requiring absolute 
uniformity in the burdens imposed by a special tax -- and thus may pose little 
threat to such measures. There is still room for special taxes to contain 
reasonable rate differentials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary effect will be to retain the status quo," Kaufer said. "If the 
decision had gone the other way, there would have been chaos. Residents in any 
school, sewer or mosquito-abatement district in the state could go out and tax 
new residences in any amount and nothing could be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose after voters in the Newhall, William S. Hart, Saugus, Castaic 
and Sulphur Springs school districts in Los Angeles County approved the special 
tax by a two-thirds vote in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raise Costs 
</P>
<P>
Developers filed suit against the tax, voicing fears that the measure would 
prohibitively raise costs of new housing. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
upheld the tax, but last Nov. 29 a state Court of Appeal ruled it was 
unconstitutional on several grounds, finding it could not stand either as a 
special tax or development fee. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate Justice H. Walter Croskey, joined by Appellate Justices Joan Dempsey 
Klein and Armand Arabian, said that without specific legislative authorization, 
school districts had no authority to impose special taxes -- and that the tax 
at issue was actually a development fee that exceeded allowable limits. 
</P>
<P>
"The characterization of these exactions as special taxes, and their submission 
to voters who would not be called upon to pay them, was a poorly disguised and 
ineffectual attempt to avoid the statutory limitations to which development 
fees are subject," Croskey wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Croskey, one of four appellate justices now under consideration by Gov. George 
Deukmejian for appointment to the state Supreme Court, said further that 
because the tax was not imposed uniformly on residents, it failed to meet the 
requirements of Proposition 13, the property tax reform initiative passed in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
Croskey noted that shortly after the voters in the Santa Clarita Valley 
approved the tax on developers, a state law went into effect that allowed 
school districts to impose special taxes, but only if they were uniformly 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
This year, another law went into effect that places procedural restrictions on 
developer fees and requires that their amount be proportional to the effect of 
new development.

WHITE HOUSE BOWS TO PLEAS; EPA TO BE PUT ON OFFSHORE OIL PANEL 
</P>

The White House, responding to pleas from environmentalists and dissent within 
the Administration, is planning to include the Environmental Protection Agency 
in a task force deliberating the future of offshore drilling, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The move will reverse an earlier decision to exclude the EPA from the panel, 
which is to be headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and will include 
top-level representatives from the National Academy of Sciences and the 
Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
That exclusion had sparked an outcry from drilling opponents, who saw EPA as 
their ally in efforts to halt drilling for environmental reasons, and from 
agency officials anxious to regain a central role in environmental policy. 
</P>
<P>
No formal decision to invite EPA to join the task force has yet been taken, a 
senior Administration official said Thursday night. But he said that Bush aides 
now have "no objections" to including its representatives on the drilling task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
An Interior Department source, meanwhile, said that he already had been 
informed that the EPA would be invited to play a key role in the task force's 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Officials described the turnabout as a victory for new EPA Administrator 
William K. Reilly, whose assertive style is making aides to Interior Secretary 
Lujan increasingly edgy. 
</P>
<P>
Already senior advisers to Lujan have met to discuss the prospect that the EPA 
chief, though not a member of Bush's Cabinet, might become the dominant force 
within the Administration on environmental and conservation issues. 
</P>
<P>
The special drilling task force was formed last week by President Bush, who 
called for delays in plans for drilling off the Southern and Northern 
California coasts until the panel made decisions based on an attempt to balance 
environmental and energy needs. The task force faces a deadline of Jan. 1, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most vocal critics of EPA's exclusion from the group was Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-Calif.), who on Wednesday sent Bush a letter urging that the panel be 
broadened to include the agency.

REHNQUIST LIFTS STAY BUT SECRETS PLAN SNAGS NORTH TRIAL 
</P>

<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist withdrew his order Thursday that had halted 
the trial of Oliver L. North, freeing the trial judge to resume proceedings 
against the former White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, preoccupied with closed-door 
discussions on how to protect U.S. secrets in one key area of North's defense, 
put off a decision on when to restart the trial. The jury has been selected but 
not sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist's action came at the request of Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, who asked 
the chief justice to lift an "administrative stay" that the Justice Department 
had sought last weekend because of disagreement over how classified material 
would be handled in the court proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Provision on Veto Power 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh, however, said Wednesday that he is satisfied a new plan offered by 
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh would protect Justice Department 
interests by giving the attorney general veto power over what sensitive data 
may be disclosed during testimony. Earlier in the week, Gesell had ruled that 
Thornburgh would have no direct participation in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's aides contend that the revised procedure abides by Gesell's ruling. But 
North's lawyers attacked the plan in court papers Thursday, charging that it 
would "cripple" court proceedings by giving Thornburgh too much leeway to 
interrupt the trial. Walsh denied this. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell sidestepped the issue Thursday but scheduled more closed-door 
discussions for this morning. He and lawyers for both sides will try to develop 
a formula at the session for use in court to protect the identities of U.S. 
allies who helped arm Nicaragua's Contras, one of Thornburgh's concerns. The 
earliest the trial could resume would be next Tuesday, after the three-day 
federal holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Legal sources said that Gesell believes he must resolve the so-called 
"third-country" dispute or the attorney general, exercising his power under the 
1980 Classified Information Procedures Act, might order all related government 
documents withheld. That action could lead to dropping some of the remaining 12 
felony counts against North. Last month, Thornburgh filed an affidavit that 
resulted in the dismissal of key charges of conspiracy and theft because of 
fear that top-secret information would have to be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers, calling the issue crucial to their case, have told Gesell they 
want to tell jurors that top officials of former President Ronald Reagan's 
Administration, including Reagan himself, approved solicitation of aid for the 
Contras from third countries at a time when Congress had banned direct U.S. 
assistance. In addition, Reagan and his top aides attempted to conceal the 
operation from Congress and the public, North's lawyers have charged in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors, on the other hand, have told Gesell that they need to 
protect the names of the 13 countries in question for fear that their 
disclosure would cause foreign nations to be reluctant to undertake future 
covert operations with the United States. North's attorneys have asserted that 
the Reagan Administration offered unspecified "CIA assistance" to those nations 
in return for their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The sticking point in the closed-door talks apparently is that North's lawyers 
want specific details presented to jurors, including evidence that Reagan 
himself ordered concealment of the third-country operation. The Justice 
Department, however, wants to develop a more generalized description of this 
operation to present to jurors without disclosing actual names. 
</P>
<P>
Open congressional hearings in 1987 revealed that Saudi Arabia, Israel, South 
Korea, Taiwan and Brunei were among the countries involved.

PAKISTAN FACING NEW FLOOD OF REFUGEES FROM AFGHANISTAN 
</P>

Tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are continuing to flee their country 
despite Wednesday's final Soviet troop withdrawal, and Pakistan is bracing for 
yet another human wave from its western neighbor in the near future, senior 
Pakistani government officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
What is worse, Pakistan's chief commissioner for Afghan refugees said, few if 
any of the 3.2 million Afghans who have been living in the squalid mud huts of 
the refugee camps here for the past nine years are likely to go home until 
Afghan President Najibullah's regime falls. Many experts here believe that 
could take months. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply do not expect them to start moving out tomorrow morning," declared 
refugee commissioner Rustam Shah Mohmand. "There is the fear of conflict, the 
fear of bombardment, the fear of shelling, the fear of prosecution, the fear of 
hostilities. And as long as there are those fears and the fears of famine and 
starvation, no refugee will leave Pakistan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Be Forced to Go 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a Thursday press conference to mark the completion of the Soviet 
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mohammad Hanif Khan, Pakistan's Cabinet 
minister in charge of refugee affairs, stressed that Pakistan will not force 
any refugees to go or to stay. But he stressed that any hopes that the Soviet 
withdrawal would signal a large-scale return of refugees to their homeland are 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, commissioner Shah Mohmand said, recent fighting near the eastern 
Afghan city of Jalalabad has forced more than 30,000 new refugees to cross the 
border in the past three months. An expected rebel rocket offensive on that 
city is likely to bring tens of thousands more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the millions of refugees who have been here for nearly a decade, peace and 
security are the principal issues in considering repatriation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic reason that compelled the refugees to leave Afghanistan was 
security," he said. "As long as there is no security, they will not go back." 
</P>
<P>
Shah Mohmand conceded that not enough has been done to repair the damage inside 
Afghanistan to meet the refugees' other basic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"The refugees will not go back unless they see some infrastructure, unless they 
see they aren't going to starve, and unless they have houses to live in," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Independent aid officials who have been working with the Afghan rebels and 
refugees for years agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're brave and strong and courageous all right, but they can't eat dirt," 
said Steve Segal, director of the International Relief Committee, which has 
been working with the Afghan refugees for nearly a decade. "If there is nothing 
done about infrastructure, we don't think they're going to go back." 
</P>
<P>
Shah Mohmand and other refugee officials say that now that the Soviet troops 
have left Afghanistan, the fate of the world's largest refugee population 
remains the biggest international problem of the Afghan war. 
</P>
<P>
Billions of dollars already have been spent by the United States, Pakistan and 
Western European nations in supporting the Afghan rebels in their war against 
the regular Afghan army and their Soviet supporters. Now that the Soviets are 
no longer a factor, refugee experts say they worry that much of that 
international financial support, both for the fighting guerrillas and the 
refugees -- groups that often overlap -- may begin to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
"Our calculations originally were that by April or May we would see large 
numbers of refugees start to return," said one official of the United Nations, 
which has been charged with overseeing the Afghans' repatriation. "But . . . if 
conditions are not stable and if fighting continues, you will see more refugees 
coming out." 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official conceded that the overwhelming majority of the refugees fled 
during 1980 and 1981 as a direct result of the Soviet's 1979 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to do with the escalation in fighting and the use of new weapons 
systems and air force, which made everybody vulnerable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he and Shah Mohmand said the massive destruction that has been done to 
Afghanistan during the past nine years -- 3,000 villages totally destroyed and 
5,000 others badly damaged, Mohmand said -- has made the refugees return 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations already has begun limited reconstruction projects inside 
Afghanistan in border regions where the fighting has stopped, principally the 
rebuilding of irrigation canals and houses. 
</P>
<P>
But it remains unclear whether enough can be done to persuade the refugees to 
go home before Pakistani public opinion begins to turn against the people who 
have been harbored and fed as Islamic brothers for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Any government that is faced with a refugee population the size of this one is 
anxious to see an end to the conflict that caused these people to flee," the 
U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
An independent aid worker who has spent several years in border refugee camps 
agreed that reconstruction is the principal refugee concern, but he, too, added 
that "the other big issue is what will the Pakistani government do. Will they 
begin to cut off ration cards to send signals to the refugees?" 
</P>
<P>
Already, Shah Mohmand said, the 30,000 new refugees have been denied the 
registration that would get them ration cards and access to U.N.-provided food. 
He said they are surviving by staying with relatives in the camps or selling 
off their few possessions. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed that life in the camps, although free of epidemics and other 
critical problems often associated with refugee life, is not such that the 
Afghans would want to stay any longer than they must. 
</P>
<P>
"The refugees' life in Pakistan is absolutely substandard," he said. "It is 
miserable. All they are getting is wheat and edible oil. The absolute majority 
of them are living in wretched conditions. There is no electricity. Fifty 
percent are living without clean drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that each and every refugee will repatriate -- some will go 
sooner, some will go later."

RULING PARTY IN SRI LANKA WINS PARLIAMENT MAJORITY

President Ranasinghe Premadasa's United National Party won a decisive majority 
in Parliament after an election campaign in which more than 1,000 people were 
killed, according to results announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The people have exercised their vote in the face of great adversity. The 
people have totally rejected the path of violence," the president said after 
the results of Wednesday's vote were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Despite death threats and assassinations by Sinhalese extremists and Tamil 
separatists trying to halt the elections, 63% of Sri Lanka's 9.3 million 
eligible voters cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Premadasa's party won 125 seats in the 225-member Parliament. The chief 
opposition group, former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka 
Freedom Party, captured 67 seats, Tamils won 23 seats, and the rest went to 
small parties and independents. 
</P>
<P>
Premadasa, who won presidential elections two months ago, failed to secure the 
two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution and key laws. That could 
hamstring legislation needed to implement his ambitious anti-poverty program, 
which he considers vital for ending sectarian violence that has killed at least 
10,000 people in the past six years.

JUDGE ACQUITS CAPTAIN OF CHARGE IN VIETNAM REFUGEE'S DROWNING

<P>
Capt. Alexander G. Balian, on trial for failing to rescue a boatload of 
Vietnamese refugees, was acquitted Thursday of a charge stemming from the death 
of a refugee who jumped from the disabled junk and drowned in the South China 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Balian, the former skipper of the U.S. amphibious transport Dubuque, still 
faces two charges of disobeying orders and dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
After Navy prosecutors rested their case Thursday, Capt. James A. Freyer, the 
judge presiding over the court-martial, said there was insufficient evidence to 
prove that Balian was guilty of violating Navy regulations when he failed to 
rescue the refugee who jumped. Freyer entered a directed verdict of not guilty 
to the charge, so it will not be considered by the jury of six Navy captains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Trace of Evidence 
</P>
<P>
Balian's lawyer, Dan Donato, had requested the directed verdict, arguing that 
there was no trace of evidence that Balian was informed that a swimmer was 
floundering in the water. Even if Balian had known the swimmer was in trouble, 
"there was no way he could have prevented it," Donato said. 
</P>
<P>
Freyer agreed, saying he could not see how a "reasonable person" could convict 
Balian based on the evidence presented by the prosecution. He said the 
testimony and logs indicated that before Balian and the others on the bridge of 
the Dubuque received reports of a body in the water, the refugee was already 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression I'm left with is that the whole thing happened very quickly," 
Freyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The swimmer was among four refugees who jumped from the junk and tried to swim 
to the Dubuque as it approached the vessel on the morning of last June 9. The 
swimmers were thrown life rings as they neared the Dubuque, but they were not 
allowed on board. The swimmer who died drowned while he was still near the 
junk, according to most of the witnesses who saw the incident. The other 
swimmers, wearing the life rings from the Dubuque, made it back to the junk. 
</P>
<P>
Navy prosecutors contended Thursday that as soon as the refugees jumped into 
the water their lives were in danger and Balian had an obligation under Navy 
regulations to rescue anyone in danger at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"When those refugees started jumping off the craft, (Balian) had an obligation 
to render assistance and no assistance was rendered," said Lt. Michael J. 
Wentworth, a Navy prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
The judge let stand a charge in which the Navy alleges that Balian violated a 
regulation when he failed to assist one of the swimmers who tried to climb a 
rope hanging from the Dubuque, but was shaken off by crew members. During the 
weeklong trial, crew members have given conflicting accounts on that part of 
the incident. Some said Balian ordered the crew to shake the refugees off the 
lines and others said no such order was ever given. Several refugees who were 
hanging on the lines said in written statements presented Thursday that they 
were simply lowered back into the water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dereliction Charged 
</P>
<P>
In the other remaining charge, the Navy alleges that Balian disobeyed orders 
and was derelict in his duty for failing to properly assess the condition of 
the refugees and give them adequate assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Balian ordered that the refugees be given food, water and directions, but 
decided, after crew members viewed the refugees from a small boat, that the 
junk was seaworthy and could reach land without further assistance. However, 
the refugees drifted for another 19 days after the Dubuque left and have said 
they resorted to cannibalism after their food ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Before prosecutors rested their case Thursday, they called several Marines to 
the stand to testify about what they saw when they set off in a small rubber 
boat to deliver supplies to the junk. The Marines described a desperate and 
chaotic situation that was far more serious than Balian apparently realized. 
But they did not report much of what they saw, they said, and were never 
debriefed by Balian or any Navy personnel when they returned to the ship.

British government Thursday froze diplomatic relations with Iran, angry over 
reports that assassination squads were en route to London to carry out a "death 
sentence" imposed by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, on 
British author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office condemned Khomeini's death threat against Rushdie, 
whose book "The Satanic Verses" has been denounced across the Muslim world as 
blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that Muslims and others may have strong views about the contents 
of Mr. Rushdie's book," it said in a statement. "However, no one has the right 
to incite people to violence on British soil or against British citizens." The 
statement, however, stopped short of completely severing relations. 
</P>
<P>
It summoned Iran's lone diplomat in Britain, Mohammed Basti, told him 
Khomeini's threat was "totally unacceptable" and demanded special protection 
for its Tehran embassy, which it reopened in December after eight years. 
</P>
<P>
However, Basti emerged from the Foreign Office in a defiant mood, saying 
Rushdie's "infamous book" has had "appalling consequences in some Islamic 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a decree, it is a verdict after careful consideration," he said of the 
death sentence. "It has nothing to do with any particular country." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, fundamentalist leaders in Iran, in a declaration on Tehran 
Radio, said, "We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry out 
the Imam's (Khomeini's) death sentence against Salman Rushdie and his 
publishers in the United States and Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension were reports that the bounty for killing the writer was 
doubled -- to $5.2 million. Tehran Radio said that the original $2.6-million 
bounty offered by Iranian religious leaders was matched Thursday by Mohammed 
Hashemian, a religious leader in the southwest city of Kerman. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States 
was "appalled" by the threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Such threats are completely irresponsible and are incompatible with basic 
standards of international conduct," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In Luxembourg, Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is regrettable. As you know, the United States is firmly committed 
to opposing terrorism in all its forms, particularly state-sponsored 
terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, who was born a Muslim in Bombay, India, but no longer practices Islam, 
is a naturalized Briton whose novel has sparked violent protests from Islamic 
fundamentalists. He has canceled a promotional tour for the book in the United 
States and remains in hiding with his American wife, Marianne Wiggins. British 
news reports said they were under police guard. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi on Thursday, an anonymous caller to the United News of India 
threatened to bomb British flights unless Rushdie emerged from hiding. India 
immediately stepped up security at its airports. 
</P>
<P>
At London's Heathrow Airport, British Airways also tightened security with 
bag-by-bag searches of luggage of passengers on its Thursday evening flights to 
the Indian subcontinent and the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament, meanwhile, called on the 12 European Community nations 
to make it clear to the Iranian government that "if there is an attempt on the 
life of Mr. Rushdie and his editors, serious sanctions will be taken against 
Iranian interests." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, French, Spanish and West German publishing companies dropped 
plans to publish the novel.

KEY EVENTS IN MANDELA CONTROVERSY

<TEXT>
<P>
July, 1988 -- Mandela home in Soweto is gutted in arson attack. Students from 
nearby high school, who had had disputes with Winnie Mandela's bodyguards known 
as the Mandela United soccer team, were arrested. Nelson Mandela sends word 
from prison that no one is to be punished or prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
January, 1989 -- Three men say they were abducted from a church residence on 
Dec. 29, 1988, by Mandela United members, taken to Winnie Mandela's house and 
beaten. They say Stompie Mokhetsi Seipie, 14, was abducted with them but had 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 27 -- Winnie Mandela says Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, murdered at his clinic the 
day before, could have corroborated her assertion that the men were abducted to 
protect them from sexual abuse. Newspapers later quote community leaders as 
saying Asvat was witness to the injuries suffered by Seipie. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 31 -- African National Congress urges Winnie Mandela to disband Mandela 
United. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 13 -- The three abducted men tell their attorney that Winnie Mandela was 
involved in the events on the night they were beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 15 -- Police identify Seipie's body, which had been found dumped in a 
Soweto field on Jan. 6. A murder investigation is opened.

RADICALS EXPECTED TO STRIKE DURING HIROHITO RITES;

JAPAN GIRDS FOR VIOLENCE AT FUNERAL

<P>
The "Imperial Funeral Excess Security Hot Line" rings steadily these days in 
Hachioji, a suburb on the western outskirts of the capital where the late 
Emperor Hirohito is to be buried next week. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the calls are threatening, apparently made by right-wing extremists 
with little tolerance for any criticism of Japan's millennium-and-a-half-old 
emperor system, the hot line's operators say. But about a fifth of them come 
from citizens who either praise the service or complain that their rights were 
violated in an encounter with some of the 24,000 police officers combing Tokyo 
for terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities are convinced that leftist radicals will strike with some sort of 
violence -- most likely bombs or rockets -- when foreign dignitaries from 150 
countries, including President Bush and 54 other heads of state, descend upon 
the city to attend the state funeral next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rocket Attack Still Rankles 
</P>
<P>
Police are still furious about a rocket attack that fizzled harmlessly during 
the Tokyo Economic Summit of seven major industrial powers three years ago, and 
they are embarrassed about a midnight bomb blast Feb. 3 that caused minor 
damage at a Shinto shrine about a mile from the park where the funeral will be 
held. They are taking no chances. An additional 8,000 men will soon be deployed 
as part of a special force of 32,000 officers, several thousand more than at 
the May, 1986, summit. 
</P>
<P>
Roadblocks have been erected. Shipments of domestic air cargo will be banned 
for a five-day period to prevent bombs. Traffic will be completely shut off 
near the route of the funeral procession next Friday. A squadron of helicopters 
and a helium-filled blimp will patrol from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is taking on the atmosphere of a city under siege, with uniformed 
policemen posted in places they are rarely ever seen, like subway platforms and 
apartment block playgrounds. Cops are knocking on doors, asking for 
"cooperation" in spot searches and passing out color leaflets with cartoons 
depicting suspicious behavior that should be reported to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that the ultra-leftists are going to cause some trouble," said a 
senior superintendent at the National Police Agency's security bureau, who 
briefed foreign reporters Thursday on the condition his name not be printed. 
"It is necessary we take measures to protect life." 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say the authorities are going too far, and that their 
enthusiasm for surveillance and control brings back disturbing memories of 
Japan's dark days of authoritarianism, which for some Japanese is symbolized by 
Emperor Hirohito, who since he died Jan. 7, has been known as the Emperor 
Showa. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that the radicals go into action when foreign leaders come to town. 
There must be security measures," said Wataru Yoshimura, a local labor leader 
in Hachioji who helped organize the hot line for complaints about police. "But 
there is no reason why ordinary citizens should be harassed." 
</P>
<P>
Yoshimura said his hot line has gotten about 400 calls since it went into 
service Feb. 1. When callers do not breathe menacingly or demand to know the 
office's location -- for the avowed purpose of torching it -- they tell stories 
about nasty run-ins with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Take the 19-year-old man from Ibaragi prefecture who was driving into Tokyo 
recently when police stopped him because a number was missing from his damaged 
license plate. When they demanded to search his trunk they found a wooden 
martial arts sword and a fruit knife. The man was arrested on the spot, 
Yoshimura said. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers in Hachioji, where the imperial mausoleum is being constructed, 
complain that police have banished their children from public playgrounds, he 
said. Police in central Tokyo stopped a 16-year-old high school student in her 
school uniform and demanded to search her bag, Yoshimura said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the emperor's death six weeks ago, police have counted 974 "ultra-left" 
demonstrations against the emperor system attended by a total of 13,715 people, 
the police superintendent said. This funeral security dragnet has gotten 
results, too. Police arrested 68 suspected radicals on such charges as using 
false names on rental contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Most of them -- 51 -- were accused of belonging to Kokurokyo, or the 
Revolutionary Workers' Assn., a small underground group that claimed 
responsibility for bombing the shrine earlier this month. The alleged leader of 
Kokurokyo's guerrilla faction, Etsuo Okazono, was nabbed on a bus while 
carrying blueprints of homemade rockets and diagrams of a government 
traffic-control dispatching facility, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Group Lobbed Rockets 
</P>
<P>
Another 17 suspects were associated with Chukaku-ha, or Middle Core Faction, 
the clandestine organization that fired rockets harmlessly over the roof of the 
official guest house in the 1986 summit. A leader of the group, which police 
believe has several thousand members, vowed in interviews with news agencies 
earlier this month to disrupt the Showa funeral. 
</P>
<P>
The senior police superintendent conceded that the radicals have probably 
improved their technology since their last demonstration of homemade firepower. 
Projectiles are expected to fly farther than the 2.4-mile range achieved in the 
attack during the 1986 summit, and a similar gain has been made in explosive 
force, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the gravest cause for vigilance is the Japanese Red Army, a band of 
hardened, expatriate terrorists who began to show signs of renewed activity 
over the past year or so. Red Army operatives, based in Lebanon, were linked to 
the fatal bomb blast at a nightclub in Naples, Italy, last April. 
</P>
<P>
Police are resigned to seeing some form of ritual violence that will disrupt 
the funeral, but they are hoping to prevent any lethal action. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure we'll get punched a little, somewhere," said the police official. 
"But we're determined there won't be a knockout."

DETROIT'S PROBLEMS IMPERIL MAYOR YOUNG'S LONG REIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 years, Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young has been the unrivaled political 
master of the nation's sixth-largest city -- and one of the most powerful black 
politicians anywhere in America. 
</P>
<P>
Young has held a virtual monopoly on Detroit politics since he was first 
elected in 1974, and his office has become a mandatory stop for virtually any 
Democrat seeking national office. 
</P>
<P>
But as he readies his bid this year for an unprecedented fifth term, the 
70-year-old Young's future is far from secure. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls find voters increasingly frustrated and angry by Young's failure 
to turn around Detroit's broken economy or to curb the city's epidemic of 
drug-related crime. At the same time, Young has suffered an embarrassing string 
of political defeats over the past year, and a growing list of powerful black 
leaders -- including some erstwhile Young allies -- are preparing to take him 
on in next September's nonpartisan primary election. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become less and less inclined over the last few years to continue to 
support Young. . . . It's time to make a change," says Erma Henderson, the 
president of the Detroit City Council and the city's top vote-getter, who 
recently announced she will challenge Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I count myself as a friend of Coleman's, but there is an extent to which the 
city could benefit from an infusion of new energy," adds Kenneth Cockrel, an 
influential black attorney and former City Council member. Cockrel, who says he 
is seriously considering running against Young this year, insists: "There is a 
feeling abroad that new blood would give the city a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
Few observers, however, expect Young, the only mayor in Detroit history to 
serve more than two terms, to go quietly. With a reported $4 million in his 
campaign war chest and a ready grass-roots organization, Young still commands a 
formidable political base and remains the man to beat in the race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Seen as Pioneer 
</P>
<P>
As the city's first black mayor, he is still seen as a pioneering leader by 
many in Detroit's black community, which now accounts for two-thirds of the 
city's population. And, as a result, even black challengers to Young in the 
past have been branded tools of white interests by some of Young's black 
supporters in this race-conscious city. 
</P>
<P>
"Young is a living legend among black voters," observes Jack Casey, a Detroit 
public relations executive and political analyst. "He never did get much 
support in the white community, but that vote is getting smaller and smaller in 
the city anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an undercurrent that says Young should step aside, and that shows an 
erosion in his support," Casey adds. "But I think it would take a vote of 
no-confidence by many, many black voters to end his tenure, and I don't see 
that happening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recent Setbacks 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Young supporters acknowledge that the mayor's power has been 
threatened by a series of recent setbacks. Most notably, Young's controversial 
proposal to bring casino gambling to the city as a way to revive Detroit's 
devastated economy was soundly defeated in a 1988 referendum. The proposal led 
to a split between Young and a number of leading Baptist ministers, who are 
extremely influential in the city's black community. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of unrest in the political arena in this city," observes the 
Rev. James Holley, a popular black minister who fought Young on the casino 
issue. "There are a lot of unhappy people." 
</P>
<P>
Young was also hurt by his decision to endorse Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis instead of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the state's Democratic 
presidential caucuses last March. Jackson swept Detroit and won the caucuses; 
even Young's own political operatives defected to Jackson. (Yet, while Jackson 
has already endorsed acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer in this year's Chicago mayoral 
race, Jackson so far has not taken a stand for or against Young in the Detroit 
race.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in last November's election, Young suffered another blow when a 
grass-roots slate of reformist candidates for the Detroit Board of Education 
swept out four Young-backed incumbents. Voters last year also rejected a 
Young-supported bond to finance further expansion of the city's downtown civic 
center. Young's critics charge he has focused too much of the city's resources 
on downtown development at a time when many of Detroit's neighborhoods have 
turned into urban wastelands. 
</P>
<P>
"Young has gone for glitzy and expensive projects downtown while the 
neighborhoods are in a shambles," complains Mel Ravitz, a City Council member 
who expects to support one of Young's challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Young suffered still more political and personal embarrassment in recent days 
after an ex-city staffer filed a paternity suit against him. In a case that has 
become the talk of Detroit, Annivory Calvert, who has just moved to California 
to become director of public works for the city of Fontana, claims she had a 
relationship with Young from 1980 to 1987 and that Young fathered her 
6-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Young has refused to comment on the paternity suit, but the case has further 
emboldened Young's opponents to call for him to finally retire. 
</P>
<P>
"The time for Coleman to step aside was a few years back," adds City Clerk 
James Bradley, a longtime Young foe. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a January poll by the Detroit News found that more than half of the 
city's voters believe Young should not seek reelection. At the same time, a 
poll in the Detroit Free Press found a virtual dead heat in a potential race 
between Young and Tom Barrow, a young black businessman who is expected to run 
against Young. 
</P>
<P>
Yet aides say Young now relishes the prospect of a real race for a change -- 
and Young also makes it quite clear that he expects to win. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the newspaper polls that suggest a close election, Young 
scolds reporters that it is far too early to predict the outcome.

DANNEMEYER HITS BACK AT CRITIC OF HIS AIDS POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), stung by a personal attack 
on his AIDS policy positions by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), struck back 
Thursday, labeling Frank's views "misguided" and criticizing Frank's "civil 
rights approach" to controlling the epidemic as a "tragedy for America." 
</P>
<P>
"It started with Cain slaying Abel," Dannemeyer wrote in a "Dear Colleague" 
letter, which goes to every member of the House. "It was perfected by Nicolo 
Machiavelli. It remains a central tactic today of radical politics. And its 
volumes of case studies have been added to most recently by our good friend and 
colleague Barney Frank. 
</P>
<P>
"The tactic is to shoot the messenger and avoid dealing with the merits of the 
message," Dannemeyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a "Dear Colleague" letter from Frank last week, a spokesman for 
Dannemeyer had said that the congressman would not respond publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, noting that Dannemeyer had since changed his mind, said: "He must have 
been disturbed at the reaction to my letter." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unusual Action 
</P>
<P>
In a highly unusual action, Frank had used the vehicle of a "Dear Colleague" 
letter -- traditionally circulated to generate support for or opposition to 
legislation -- to criticize Dannemeyer for consistently fighting AIDS proposals 
advocated by public health experts and for arguing that health officials and 
House members are "out of touch" with the thinking of the American people on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Frank pointed out that the recent California initiative dealing with acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome, which Dannemeyer sponsored, was overwhelmingly 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In his own letter, Dannemeyer acknowledged that Proposition 102 was "indeed 
defeated" but maintained that most of its provisions "were passed separately by 
the California state Legislature . . . as a result of the political pressure 
created by the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 102 would have required physicians to disclose the names of 
individuals suspected of being or known to be infected with the AIDS virus. It 
would also have required that sexual partners of people infected with the AIDS 
virus be traced and notified and would have repealed laws barring insurance 
companies and employers from making use of AIDS test results. It was almost 
universally opposed by the public health community. 
</P>
<P>
Although some provisions of the initiative were approved by legislators, the 
critical section -- requiring physicians to report the names of infected 
individuals -- was not. 
</P>
<P>
"During the campaign, Rep. Dannemeyer denied that the Legislature's actions 
made passage of Proposition 102 unnecessary," said Larry Bush, an assistant to 
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer said in his letter that he would continue to push for a public 
policy that requires disclosing the names of individuals infected with the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me suggest to my colleagues that the AIDS policies advocated by Mr. Frank 
are those that are increasingly recognized as misguided by Americans," he 
wrote. " . . . Perhaps future debate in the House will allow the merit of a 
proposal to be fully debated without the rancor of partisan personal attacks." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer has also opposed legislation that would protect AIDS patients and 
those infected with the virus from discrimination and from violations of 
confidentiality regarding their test results. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Dannemeyer submitted a list of 15 questions that he said "must 
be answered by proponents of anti-discrimination laws for carriers of (AIDS)." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Dannemeyer wrote: "How can the operator of a blood bank refuse the 
offered blood of someone who is (infected with AIDS) when such a person would 
be able to claim that refusal to take the blood is an act of discrimination?" 
</P>
<P>
Frank said that such questions demonstrate that Dannemeyer "doesn't understand 
the anti-discriminations laws. They do not require you to hire a blind person 
to judge an art contest or put somebody in a wheelchair on a track team. You 
treat people differently only in areas where the difference is relevant."

THOMAS BERNHARD; AUSTRIAN PLAYWRIGHT 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Controversial writer and dramatist Thomas Bernhard, whose works dwelt in the 
dark reaches of alienation and terrorism and whose last play in Vienna sparked 
public demonstrations and cultural divisiveness, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The enfant terrible of Austrian theater and literature who had been likened an 
heir to Franz Kafka was 58. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Thursday that Bernhard was found dead of apparent heart failure in 
his house in the town of Gmunden on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman declined to say why it had taken four days to announce the death, 
but the Austria Press Agency later reported that it was Bernhard's wish to be 
buried before his death was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Bernhard, whose play "Heldenplatz" ("Heroes' Square") accused Austrians of 
being anti-Semites and fascists and enraged many politicians, had suffered for 
many years from a lung condition that Austrian radio said required regular 
treatment with cortisone. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Netherlands, Bernhard was the illegitimate child of a Salzburg 
woman and a peasant father whom he never knew. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times book critic Richard Eder in reviewing Bernhard's "A Memoir" 
in 1986 said that because of the circumstances of his birth, the author had 
since burned "with a succession of prosecutorial fires: infantile, adolescent 
and adult. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in Vienna, the Austrian countryside and southern Bavaria before 
being sent in his early teens to a home in Salzburg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grocer's Apprentice 
</P>
<P>
Leaving school early to become a grocer's apprentice, Bernhard was hospitalized 
for months at a time with severe lung complaints from 1948 to 1951. In 1955, he 
entered Salzburg's famed Mozarteum to study acting and music and in 1957 
published his first volume of poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Publication of several novels, short stories and more poetry followed, winning 
an increasing series of awards for the man whom prominent West German critic 
Marcel Reich-Ranicki termed "the most melancholy poet and most bitter prophet 
of German literature." 
</P>
<P>
His plays, often directed by the controversial director of Vienna's 
Burgtheater, Claus Peymann, were a continual subject of controversy in Vienna 
and Salzburg. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, for instance, his play "The Famous" opened in Vienna after being 
rejected by the Salzburg festival because of its criticism of prominent 
Salzburg cultural figures. 
</P>
<P>
Peymann's production of "Heldenplatz" at the Burgtheater last fall also sparked 
a raging controversy over whether state money should be used to subsidize art 
so critical of Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Many Vienna critics, however, praised the play and its performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Heldenplatz" tells the story of a Jewish professor who emigrates in 1938 when 
the Nazis march in, returns later and eventually commits suicide because he 
feels Austria in 1988 has barely changed its attitude toward Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 police seized his book "Woodcutting" because of allegations that it 
insulted a well-known Viennese cultural figure. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Eder wrote, Bernhard's sense of life was "implacably hostile."

JAMES BOND, 89; ORNITHOLOGIST'S NAME MADE FAMOUS IN FICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A world-famous ornithologist, whose name became synonymous with secret agentry 
because of a chance literary encounter with Ian Fleming, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The real James Bond, unlike his fictional counterpart, lived 89 peaceful years 
before dying of the complications of age Tuesday at a hospital in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural Sciences, was the 
leading authority on birds of the West Indies for more than half a century and 
is best known for proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North 
America, not South America. 
</P>
<P>
In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing Caribbean birds 
of North American ancestry from those of South American origins has been called 
"Bond's Line." 
</P>
<P>
But his name was to become a household synonym for intrigue after World War II 
because Fleming was reading his book, "Birds of the West Indies," while writing 
at his home in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, an avid bird watcher, adopted the ornithologist's name for the dashing 
character since portrayed in movies by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and other 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine 
name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born," Fleming 
wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary. 
</P>
<P>
"In return I can only offer you or James Bond unlimited use of the name Ian 
Fleming for any purposes you may think fit," he wrote. "Perhaps one day your 
husband will discover a particularly horrible species of bird which he would 
like to christen in an insulting fashion by calling it Ian Fleming."

3 KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN GANG SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three more people -- including a teen-age boy -- were killed in three separate 
gang-related shootings on the streets of Los Angeles and Compton, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Kinslow, 15, died at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center after he 
and a friend, Johnny Lucien, 14, were shot with a semiautomatic weapon by a 
gunman in a car Wednesday afternoon as they walked along North Dwight Avenue in 
Compton. Lucien was reported in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
About three hours later, Los Angeles police said, Harold Kenneth, 18, 
identified as a member of the Bloods street gang, was killed at 92nd Street and 
Central Avenue as he walked with his girlfriend. Officers were told that a man 
in a car pulled up and fired several shots from a handgun after saying he was 
going to kill a Blood. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, Lt. Rob Watters said, shots fired from a stolen car killed Jorge 
Ricky Hernandez, 18, as he walked with friends at Belmont Avenue and Temple 
Street in the Echo Park area. 
</P>
<P>
Officers later arrested a 16-year-old boy as well as Martin Aguilar and Julio 
Escobar, both 18. They were identified as gang members.

SPRINKLERS DOUSE FIRE ON OIL TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overheated bearing packing in the pumping room of an oil tanker docked at the 
Long Beach Pier sparked a fire Thursday that was quickly extinguished by 
sprinklers aboard the vessel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries from the fire, but smoke spread through much 
of the tanker, Arco Alaska, causing minor damage, Long Beach Fire Department 
spokesman Bob Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe that packing around pump bearings overheated and 
triggered a fire in fuel oil, Caldon said. 
</P>
<P>
City firefighters and Coast Guard crews assisted workers aboard the tanker in 
blowing the smoke from the vessel.

The Republican Party rolled out its biggest guns Thursday -- President Bush and 
former President Ronald Reagan -- in an effort to keep a former Ku Klux Klan 
leader from being elected to the Legislature as a member of the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Letters emphasizing Bush's endorsement of Republican businessman John Treen in 
his state House race against David Duke were circulated throughout the 
district, and radio commercials featuring Reagan's voice were broadcast 
throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Treen, 63, and Duke, 38, a former grand wizard of the klan, are in a runoff 
election Saturday to represent the nearly all-white district in Metairie, a New 
Orleans suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Duke led a field of seven candidates with 33% of the vote in the Jan. 21 
primary. Treen had 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Reagan did not mention Duke in their endorsements, but state and 
national Republican officials made it clear that a Duke victory would harm the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if Attila the Hun joined our party," Republican State Chairman William 
Nungesser said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to be political favors being called in," Duke said after Treen received 
the presidential endorsements. "I'm really tired of this.

MACDONALD IS FOCUS OF BRIBERY INQUIRY, RECALL DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
NAVAJO LEADER STEPS DOWN AMID PROBE 
</P>

<P>
Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald stepped down late Thursday amid a corruption 
probe that has pitched the nation's largest Indian tribe into perhaps its most 
serious crisis in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
The 88-member Tribal Council was left in disarray after three stormy days of 
debate and delaying tactics by MacDonald supporters. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald is the focus of both federal and tribal investigations, and he is the 
target of a recall campaign within the 200,000-member tribe. Their reservation 
covers much of northeastern Arizona and extends into part of New Mexico and 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Admitting that grass-roots opposition could bring the Navajo capital "to a 
standstill," MacDonald placed himself on paid administrative leave, 
relinquishing the power of the office he has held for 14 of the last 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
He left the council chambers to applause and a standing ovation after a calm 
but emotional speech focusing on the need for tribal unity. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, we come back to the same circle that we are Navajos and we love 
each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald will keep his $55,000 salary but he failed in his bid to name his own 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council rejected appeals by the 60-year-old chairman to pay his 
legal expenses and furnish him with an office and staff while he fights 
allegations that he accepted kickbacks from contractors in exchange for doing 
business with the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"We face a difficult fight on many fronts," said MacDonald, who has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, MacDonald emerged as a key target of Senate hearings into 
alleged fraud and mismanagement in Indian programs and on reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Two contractors told a Senate subcommittee that MacDonald received at least 
$125,000 in kickbacks since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald has acknowledged receiving gifts from contractors, describing them as 
tokens of appreciation for his leadership with no strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
The Navajo leader complained that the Senate hearings were racist and a threat 
to tribal sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
"Sovereignty is not the issue and the Navajo tribe is not the issue. The issue 
is wrongdoing by one person, by one individual -- the chairman," said Jimmy 
Bitsuie, vice president of the Native Rights Assn., which advocates a tribal 
constitution rather than the existing code. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald also apparently is under investigation by a federal grand jury in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Tazbah McCullah, tribal press secretary, confirmed Thursday that tribal 
documents had been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
"They want documents, contracts, bids and proposals," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council still must decide on an interim chairman and faces considerable 
confusion over the interpretation of tribal codes in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Also unclear is when and under what circumstances MacDonald might be allowed to 
return. Various resolutions up for debate suggest that he step down for a year 
or until his name is cleared, whichever comes first -- but the tribe is only 11 
months away from new elections, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Tribal police guarded council chambers during the open session, which was 
packed with spectators and the media. 
</P>
<P>
As the debate over MacDonald's fate dragged on for a third day, a small crowd 
of Navajos waiting outside could be heard shouting "Vote!" to the council. 
</P>
<P>
The proceedings, conducted in both Navajo and English, were broadcast live on 
tribal radio. 
</P>
<P>
Videotapes of damaging testimony against MacDonald by his son and contractors 
before the Senate subcommittee have been shown during town hall meetings across 
the vast reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most crucial issue to face the Navajo nation in its long, proud 
history," said Larry Anderson, a councilman among the MacDonald opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson told reporters MacDonald should resign "in an effort to restore 
integrity and credibility to our government."

<P>
FOE ACCUSES BERNARDI OF SKIRTING LAW 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, co-author of the city's campaign 
reform law, was accused by a political foe Thursday of violating the spirit, if 
not the letter, of a $500-per-donor limit on campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi denied any wrongdoing, but admitted making an error in reporting one 
of the questionable contributions. He said he returned another questionable 
contribution last week. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Hall, a firefighter who is challenging Bernardi in the April 11 election 
in the northeast San Fernando Valley's 7th District, called for a city 
attorney's investigation of a possible violation of the city's elections law. A 
spokesman for the city attorney said the office has not received the request 
and would not comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Hall cited two $500 checks that Bernardi reported receiving Dec. 23 from Gelb 
Enterprises, a property management firm in Encino. A 1985 voter-approved law 
limits contributions to council candidates to $500 per source. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$500 Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Hall added that Bernardi reported receiving $500 each on Dec. 14 from Santa 
Monica developer Ray Watt, his brother Donald, Donald's wife Florence, 
Watt/Parker Inc. and Watt Pac Inc. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon or illegal for several employees of a company or several 
members of a family to contribute $500 each to a council candidate. But if an 
employer requires an employee to make a contribution or reimburses an employee, 
it could violate the law, according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Hall accused Bernardi of "using the 
same tactics that he has publicly denounced." He was referring to Bernardi's 
criticism of his colleagues for accepting $500 contributions from several 
employees of the same company. 
</P>
<P>
"While this technically may comply with the letter of the law, it clearly 
defies the spirit," Hall quoted Bernardi as writing in a letter to the editor 
of a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he erred in reporting two $500 contributions from Gelb 
Enterprises. He said the contributions were made independently by two employees 
of the company, which is permitted under the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tickets to Dinner 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Gelb, general partner of Gelb Enterprises, confirmed Bernardi's account. 
He said he and his brother each bought two tickets to Bernardi's $250-a-plate 
dinner Thursday night at the Sportsmen's Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Gelb said he contributed to Bernardi because Bernardi was the only council 
member who attended a party held several years ago to honor Gelb's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was very nice of him," he said. Gelb said his firm conducts no 
business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he returned $500 to Watt Pac last week after learning that the 
funds are controlled by Donald Watt, who already had given him $500. But he 
said he kept $500 contributions from Donald Watt, his wife Florence, his 
brother Ray and Watt/Parker because "they are all separate accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he follows the law scrupulously. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some $7,000 in checks over the legal limit that we have returned 
since we started this fund-raising," Bernardi said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to get into a debate with Lyle," Bernardi added. "He needs to 
get name recognition and this kind of material makes headlines." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second attack on Bernardi this week by Hall, who had pledged last 
year not to conduct a negative campaign. On Monday, Hall criticized Bernardi 
for his poor attendance at council meetings in the last year. Bernardi said he 
missed about 21% of the meetings because he and his wife were ill. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Councilwoman Joy Picus, co-author of the city's campaign reform law, 
returned $3,000 she received from six employees of a development firm because 
of "the appearance of a possible attempt to skirt the law." 
</P>
<P>
In her case, some of the contributions came from secretaries. She said it is 
not customary for secretaries to make contributions.

SANTA CLARITA SCHOOL TAX DEAD; 
</P>
<P>
STATE HIGH COURT REFUSES TO HEAR DISTRICTS' APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita Valley school officials expressed disappointment and frustration 
Thursday after the state Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that 
voided a special tax on new development to build schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously I'm not happy," said Clyde Smyth, superintendent of the William S. 
Hart Union High School District, one of five valley districts that had hoped to 
collect millions of dollars from the tax, which was overwhelmingly approved by 
voters in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The tax, roughly $6,300 on each new home, was declared unconstitutional by a 
state Court of Appeal in November. A three-judge panel said it was illegal 
because it unfairly applied only to future residents of the Hart, Newhall, 
Castaic, Saugus and Sulphur Springs school districts. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court also said the tax exceeded a state limit on developer fees. 
State law allows districts to collect $1.50 per square foot on new homes for 
school construction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Refusal 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court refused Thursday to hear the districts' challenge to the 
appellate decision. 
</P>
<P>
Sandie Loberg, president of the Hart board of trustees, said the Supreme Court 
failed to respect the voters' wishes. "I think the voters made a statement in 
this community," she said. "I find it extremely discouraging." 
</P>
<P>
The court's decision leaves the valley's schools with few funding alternatives, 
Loberg said. "Where it goes from here I don't know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials estimate that the valley will need $210 million by 2000 to 
build four high schools, four junior high schools and five elementary schools 
to absorb more than 15,000 new students. Present enrollment is about 22,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hart trustees said the valley's school districts may have to ask 
residents to tax themselves to pay for new schools in the rapidly growing 
region. The Supreme Court's decision will obviously force the districts to 
consider such a tax proposal seriously, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
A school tax would require two-thirds approval to pass, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Santa Clarita City Council recently agreed to place a tax measure 
on the November ballot to raise money for new roads. That proposal, which would 
increase annual property tax bills between $75 and $200, must be approved by 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to reach the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The tax on new development, although struck down Thursday, funneled some funds 
into Santa Clarita Valley's schools. 
</P>
<P>
While some developers refused to pay the tax pending the outcome of the lawsuit 
by the California Building Industry Assn., other developers paid it, agreeing 
not to seek a refund if the tax were declared unconstitutional. The Hart 
district alone received $10.5 million from four developers building new homes 
in the valley.

ROMEY, HOROWITZ DENY CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
KORENSTEIN SAYS GIFTS TO RIVALS VIOLATE NEW CAMPAIGN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein has filed a complaint with the 
state Fair Political Practices Commission, alleging that two of her opponents 
in the April 11 election have received contributions that violate a new state 
campaign financing law. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein's campaign consultant, Parke Skelton, first aired his allegations 
against Barbara Romey and Gerald Horowitz on Feb. 4. At that time, he said he 
asked that they return the contributions in question. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton said Thursday that he filed formal complaints with the commission 
Tuesday because he had not received a reply from either challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Romey said the contributions questioned by Korenstein were completely legal. 
</P>
<P>
"She's trying to run a dirty campaign and she's always attacking because she 
has been a poor excuse for a representative," Romey said. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz accused Korenstein of substituting the charges to the commission for a 
debate on educational issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been enough mudslinging and I think the public is really 
tired of that," Horowitz said. "I find it distressful that she won't allow the 
community to hear her stands on the critical issues facing education." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Countercharge Made 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz charged that Korenstein had broken the same campaign financing law. He 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in November approved Proposition 73, the campaign reform measure that 
sets a $1,000 limit on individual political contributions and bans the transfer 
of funds from one candidate's campaign committee to another's. 
</P>
<P>
Skelton's complaint charged that a $2,000 contribution to Horowitz from the 
campaign committee of Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Ham, Horowitz's treasurer, said the contribution from the Bernson 
campaign was placed in a restricted account that will be used only after the 
election. If Horowitz wins, the money will go for reimbursable expenses and, if 
he loses, it will go to charity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint also questioned a $2,500 contribution to Horowitz from Janice E. 
Sato. 
</P>
<P>
Ham said that contribution came from both Sato and her husband, Dennis, and 
therefore $2,000 is allowable under the new law. The $500 exceeding the limit 
was placed in the restricted account, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A third violation alleged by Korenstein's campaign involved $5,600 in printing 
costs donated to the Horowitz campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gift Termed Illegal 
</P>
<P>
Skelton's letter to the commission said the printed materials that were 
contributed cannot be used by the campaign in 1989. In an interview, he 
suggested that the printing actually was paid for by a Horowitz supporter. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my guess, someone paid for that printing and he is hiding it," 
Skelton said. 
</P>
<P>
Ham said that the gift of printing was received in November and that the bulk 
of it was distributed before Jan. 1, when the campaign reform law went into 
effect. The materials not distributed before that date will be purchased by the 
campaign, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint against Romey also involved a contribution from Bernson's 
campaign committee. Skelton alleged that a $2,000 contribution from Bernson to 
an inactive Romey committee -- one that was organized when Romey made an 
unsuccessful 1987 bid for the Board of Education -- was illegally transferred 
to Romey's present committee. 
</P>
<P>
Romey said that her 1987 committee still exists and that it properly reported 
the Bernson contribution. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the commission, Skelton asked for a rapid decision. 
</P>
<P>
Eight candidates are challenging Korenstein.

CRITIC CLAIMS L-SHAPED BUILDING IN STUDIO CITY MAY COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A political battle over a controversial office building under construction in a 
Studio City residential area is turning scientific. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the three-story commercial project in the 4100 block of Sunswept 
Drive said Thursday that they have scientific evidence that the hill beneath 
the new building "will give way within a year." 
</P>
<P>
That contention was immediately disputed by the building's designer and Los 
Angeles city officials. Earlier this week they dismissed allegations that the 
structure is being illegally constructed and should be ordered torn down or 
turned into residential condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The $500,000 L-shaped office building partially wraps around an apartment house 
and blocks the view of a house in a hillside neighborhood south of Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Mort Allen, who owns the apartment house and a row of retail shops down the 
hill from the office building site, has led the attack on the new building. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he was told this week "by one of the finest geologists in 
California" that the hill below the new office and above his shops is in danger 
of collapsing because of the new building's construction. 
</P>
<P>
"The hillside between Sunswept and Ventura is critical soil," Allen said. 
Unless the new building has "40-foot caissons to bedrock, the entire hill . . . 
will give way within a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the geologist told him that his shops at the bottom of the hill are 
"almost worthless and possibly unsafe to have tenants occupy." The shops house 
his real estate office, a boutique, a seat-cover shop and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's geologist, Arthur R. Brown of Seal Beach, could not be contacted 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But city safety experts and the building's architect denied that the hill and 
the new office building are unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no danger of collapse. The building's safe. It's built to code," said 
Robert Kline, a principal commercial property inspector for the city Department 
of Building and Safety. "There is no indication the hill is going to collapse." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inspection Requested 
</P>
<P>
Kline said he inspected the Sunswept Drive building at the request of City 
Councilman Mike Woo's office after Allen complained that it was illegally 
constructed and lacked proper drainage and parking. 
</P>
<P>
In a Jan. 26 letter to Woo, Allen demanded that the councilman use his 
influence to block occupancy of the building until 11 alleged shortcomings at 
the project were corrected. 
</P>
<P>
In his report to Woo, Kline refuted each of Allen's allegations, said Julie 
Jaskol, a spokeswoman for Woo. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said a geologic report prepared for the office project differs from 
previous ground studies done in the area. 
</P>
<P>
A 1972 geologic report discussed a slope failure on the hill below the office 
site. It noted that the failure occurred when a retaining wall collapsed and 
"saturated clay soils liquefied and flowed against" Allen's shops. 
</P>
<P>
That landslide "extinguished the flame of a water heater and a gas explosion 
further damaged the structure," it noted. The collapse left a "failure scar 
some 20 feet in length and about 5 feet in height" across the slope, the report 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
But a 1987 slope stability report done by a different geologist for the office 
project concluded that the hillside areas are "well-established and show no 
indication of past slope failures." 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the slopes "have a higher than minimum safety factor . . 
. and should be considered safe." 
</P>
<P>
A companion report, prepared by the project's geologists, called for a 
foundation for the building that would contain footings extending two feet into 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Mikaelian, whose architectural firm designed the building and plans to 
move into it when it is finished, said there is no need for 40-foot caissons 
extending down to bedrock, as Allen's geologist recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"The soils engineers found good soil, absolutely outstanding soil," Mikaelian 
said Thursday. "Our footings are to city standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe this man," he said of Allen. "He will try anything." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Association Ally 
</P>
<P>
But Allen appeared to have an ally Thursday in Polly Ward, president of the 
Studio City Residents Assn. Ward was asked by Allen to use her group's clout to 
persuade the city to take a closer look at the hillside's stability. 
</P>
<P>
"If Mort has a geology report that says something different from what the city 
has concluded, we'll go back to the councilman's office and ask them to look at 
it," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my concern that what he says about the slope may be true and it could 
give way. That whole hillside is geologically unstable. When they tamper with 
that hill, it bothers me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Jaskol said Woo's office will dispatch city inspectors to the site to take 
another look if that is what the association wants. 
</P>
<P>
"We respond to all reasonable concerns," Jaskol said. "Polly Ward and her group 
are reasonable."

Campbell Soup Co. said second-quarter earnings rose 12% to $94.9 million and 
sales advanced 18% to $246 million, both record levels, aided by strong gains 
in domestic core brands and international acquisitions. The Camden, N.J., food 
company said all of its operating divisions -- Campbell U.S.A., Campbell 
International, Pepperidge Farm and Campbell Enterprises -- scored gains despite 
increased costs of ingredients and packaging.

OPERA, LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE WIN TOTAL OF $650,000

<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts on Thursday announced awards worth a total 
of $650,000 to two San Diego institutions. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera received a $400,000 award and the La Jolla Playhouse was 
awarded $250,000. The pair were among 11 California organizations named to 
split a total of $3.4 million in federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
Both local institutions said they will use their grants to improve their 
financial stability. A spokeswoman for the opera said that, in addition to 
going toward establishment of a permanent cash reserve, the grant will be used 
to raise the organization's funding level over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse will use its award to reduce its debt, create a cash reserve and 
help build its endowment, according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight organizations in 27 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin 
Islands were awarded $19.2 million in grants in the final phase of the NEA's 
Challenge I and Challenge II programs. The size of the awards ranged from 
$100,000 to $1 million, which went to Minneapolis' Walker Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing NEA chairman Frank Hodsoll announced the grants at a Thursday-morning 
news conference at the Otis Parsons Institute of Parsons School of Design in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Our challenge grants are a small contribution," he told officials from each 
California institution to receive an award. "It is the people here today and 
your colleagues nationwide who have the day-to-day task of making sure the best 
cultural institutions in the country are strong. Today we see that that 
activity in California is alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the NEA grants required that the federal funds be matched 3-to-1 
with new or increased funds over a three-year period. In other words, both the 
opera and the playhouse must match each dollar of the federal money with $3 of 
increased funding over three years. 
</P>
<P>
When matched, the opera's $400,000 grant will total $1.6 million. The playhouse 
will use its $250,000 award to raise another $750,000 over three years. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Hughes, a publicist for the opera, said its $400,000 grant was the 
largest awarded nationwide to any opera and the only award to a California 
opera during the current grant cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Playhouse managing director Alan Levey said the theater will use part of its 
award to reduce the $703,000 debt it has accrued over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
Levey attributed the debt to "budget overages" beginning in 1986 and predicted 
that, with the help of the challenge grant, the playhouse will "complete our 
deficit reduction in two to three years." 
</P>
<P>
The other California institutions named to receive grants, most for purposes of 
financial stabilization, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Public-television station KCET Channel 28, Los Angeles, $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Otis Parsons Institute of Parsons School of Design, $500,000, for the 
school's $12-million campus expansion project to include a new building with 
studios, an auditorium and a library. 
</P>
<P>
* Craft and Folk Art Museum, Los Angeles, $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Huntington Library, art collections and botanical gardens, San Marino, 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
* American Cinematheque, Hollywood, $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Society, $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
* American Conservatory Theatre, San Francisco, $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Berkeley, $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
* California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland, $250,000.

2 WAYS OF VIEWING LA JOLLA EXHIBIT OF MONSEN COLLECTION 
</P>

LA JOLLA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sailing brig plies the huge but glassy sea as the sun shines on part of the 
scene through banks of soft, gray clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Next to this image is another gorgeous photograph: puffy ranks of clouds that 
sail above a choppy, glistening Golden Gate seaway. The first portrayal is 
Frenchman Gustave Le Gray's 1856 camera-made seascape, "Brig Upon the Water." 
The latter was made scores of years later in another world by another artist, 
Ansel Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so beautiful, I had to have it," collector Joseph Monsen said of the 
Adams print. Monsen also acquired the Le Gray because he "knew this was the 
most famous photograph of the day. It won all the gold medals," he said, and 
"Le Gray turned out to be one of the greatest artists in early photography." 
</P>
<P>
Now both, along with 115 others are on view in "150 Years of Photographic 
Ideas: Selections from the Monsen Collection" at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art through April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Monsen, a university professor, who lives part of the year in Seattle and part 
in La Jolla, says the 117-piece exhibit amounts to only about 5% of his 
collection. Two other exhibitions from his collection are running 
simultaneously in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the La Jolla display features superior examples by many of the great 
names in photography: Carleton Watkins, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Edward 
Steichen, Alfred Steiglitz and Margaret Cameron. Contemporary artists are also 
represented: Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherman, the Starn Twins and Duane Michals. 
</P>
<P>
However, Monsen said, the organization of the display by Hugh Davies, director 
of the La Jolla museum, has stirred some surprising controversy among museum 
professionals because the photographs are not arranged in chronological order 
or by subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Davies has juxtaposed images of similar subjects photographed over the 
years by different artists. Up to a point, this tack reveals the creative and 
visual processes of different artists at work. 
</P>
<P>
Three views of marsh landscapes are easy to follow. Roger Fenton, Queen 
Victoria's official photographer, has a classically pastoral 1860 landscape of 
a lowland scene, similar to Peter Emerson's 1888 "Rushy Shore." Contrasted with 
these is Harry Callahan's darkly romantic 1958 picture of wild grasses. 
</P>
<P>
Two photographs of Egypt's pyramids reveal how conditions there have 
drastically changed. In 1858, Francis Frith exposed a glass negative that shows 
only three nomads on the vast desert expanse near a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Eugene Omar Goldbeck captured crowds of visitors and tour buses 
arriving at the pyramids and the Sphinx in a panoramic black and white view. 
</P>
<P>
But Davies, according to a brochure on the exhibit, also sets up more complex 
juxtapositions, in which the viewer is supposed to reach conclusions on social 
or political issues. Trying to make the connections can easily distract the 
viewer's attention from the exceptional photography Davies has gathered. 
</P>
<P>
A more rewarding approach might be to concentrate on individual photographs and 
not worry about the relationships between images. 
</P>
<P>
Monsen started collecting wooden Chinese and Japanese sculpture in 1958, and 
graduated to photography in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"I want beautiful pictures, but I'm also interested in the ideas behind the 
pictures," Monsen said. He is also driven as a collector by "the exhilaration 
of searching for a piece -- the search, the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla exhibit fills five galleries. One gallery is mostly 19th-Century 
landscapes. Another room is devoted chiefly to images of boys, women and 
cityscapes. A hallway is ranked with portraits from different periods. 
</P>
<P>
One dominant photograph is Tina Barney's large color image of a 1984 graduation 
day at a prep school. The fresh, almost life-sized faces of the eight girls 
wearing white cotton dresses with blue sashes are a picture of youthful 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't work in a snapshot size," Monsen said, commenting on how 
different photos "work" at different sizes. Vito Acconci's series of 12 snaps 
made each time he blinked walking down a New York street, are not very 
artistic, but that's not why Monsen bought them. 
</P>
<P>
Acconci took the pictures to document a performance art piece years ago. Monsen 
bought the images because he wanted works "on the edge of photography, the 
cusp. I felt it was important to the collection to document the fringes, the 
edges of what's going on in photography," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Monsen says he has to feel comfortable with the prints he buys. He 
searched for four or five years before settling on a piece by former San Diegan 
John Baldessari. "I didn't want pictures of people lying dead or shot," Monsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baldessari's large black-and-white and color piece Titled "Eye lid (with log)," 
is a collage made from a number of closely cropped images, some taken from 
movies, of men's and women's faces, and a log. The internal juxtaposition of 
people in dress attire and others from an apparently wartime scene makes an 
arresting artwork. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby New York City street-corner scene by artist William Klein bristles 
with urban energy. 
</P>
<P>
A misleading 1927 Harlem group portrait by early black photographer James Van 
de Zee is among a mixture of portraits in the museum's hall. Close examination 
reveals that the sexes are reversed. The rank of well-dressed "men" standing 
behind a row of seated "women" are actually women, and the women, wearing 
tailored suits and nylons, are men. 
</P>
<P>
The museum appears to have made an effort to link the Monsen exhibit with its 
other show, a retrospective of Texas artist Vernon Fisher. Fisher's painted 
sculpture on "space and volume," which shows erosion, matches up with Asahel 
Curtis' adjacent 1910 photograph of the leveling of Seattle hills by 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders whether another piece, Fisher's camera obscura, was mere 
serendipity or planned. Today's camera was, after all, named for the Latin 
camera (chamber) obscura (dark) -- a room with a small hole in the wall that 
allowed an outside image to be projected against the opposite wall. In its 
simplest form, that's what a camera is. 
</P>
<P>
At one end of the Monsen collection exhibit, Fisher's camera obscura projects a 
stunning upside down image -- just as a camera does -- of the street and 
coastline behind the museum. It is so unexpected that some visitors mistake the 
moving images for a film. 
</P>
<P>
In its organization, "150 Years of Photographic Ideas" may be too clever for 
its own good. But, if you want a history of photography, from the beauty of the 
early days to the drama of the present, this exhibit has it all.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: THE RIGHT INTERPRETATION 
SOMETIMES LEADS TO LOVE 
</P>

<P>
It began in 1980 with "Children of a Lesser God," Mark Medoff's Tony 
award-winning play about the troubled love affair between a deaf woman and a 
hearing man. 
</P>
<P>
That story, which sensitized theater audiences to the ways in which the 
hearing-impaired can feel excluded from the rest of the world, generated a 
series of programs around the country in which shows were "interpreted" by 
people simultaneously translating the actors' words into sign language for deaf 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Now the San Diego Theatre League, which experimented with a series of 
interpreted performances last year, will sponsor 10 such shows this season. 
</P>
<P>
It seems fitting that this year's inaugural interpreted presentation, the Feb. 
25 showing at the Lyceum Stage of "As Is," the poignant story about AIDS, will 
be ushered in by a couple who compare their own courtship to the one depicted 
in "Children of a Lesser God." 
</P>
<P>
Rico Peterson, who will interpret, and Freda Norman, who will lead a half-hour 
pre-show discussion, met at the National Theatre for the Deaf in 1973. There, 
Norman was an actress and Peterson an actor hired to provide narration for 
hearing members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We met, we fought, we fell in love," Peterson recalled. "I didn't know sign 
language and didn't want to learn. We wound up hating each other. Then she had 
to interpret for me for a deaf audience, and it sensitized each of us to the 
other's predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'How did you get interested in deafness?' I never did. It wasn't 
something that made me say, 'Gosh, I have to know this.' I just had to know it 
to know this person. Freda is from a deaf family, and everyone in her world is 
deaf. I just learned sign language like someone would learn French. You take 
things where you find them." 
</P>
<P>
The interpreted theater series continues with "Alice in Wonderland" at the 
Christian Youth Theatre on March 4, "Sleeping Beauty" at the San Diego Junior 
Theatre on April 22, "Amadeus" at the La Jolla Stage Company on May 6, "The 
Sound of Music" at the Starlight on July 13, "Joseph &amp; the Amazing 
Technicolor Dreamcoat," at the Lamb's Players Theatre on Oct. 20, "Hay Fever" 
at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre on Nov. 17 and "The Grapes of Wrath" and 
"Macbeth" at the La Jolla Playhouse at times to be announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Sushi Performance Gallery will open its seventh annual Neofest, April 
29-June 3, with a bang -- literally. "Maria on Highway 94," scripted by local 
artists Carla Kirkwood and Deborah Small, tells the tragic tale of a freeway 
shooting. Like Sledgehammer Theatre's living movie, "Blow Out the Sun," "Maria" 
will be staged in a downtown warehouse through which a car will be driven to 
heighten the realism. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Schuette, the artistic director of Sushi, likens a season ticket to 
Neofest -- an intense six-week version of what Sushi normally spreads out over 
a year -- to enrollment in a "a crash course" in the interdisciplinary arts. 
Just as Sushi's offerings are unique in their melding of contemporary 
disciplines, the organization's attitude toward individual artists makes it the 
last refuge of the solitary performer, unaligned with any major organization 
and working from commission to commission. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Schuette has paid two San Diego artists to create material for this 
festival. Don Victor may have done portions of his comic monologue, "Picture 
Postcard," at the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre and Underground at the Lyceum. But 
the piece had its genesis as a commission by Sushi, which plans to present the 
world premiere of the completed piece May 11-13. The other commissioned San 
Diego artist, David Keevil, will present "Really Seeing Bert," an audience 
event in which the members will learn how to do a performance on three 
successive Mondays: May 1, 8 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the festival are Thought Music, a trio of female artists from New 
York presenting a multimedia piece called "Teenytown" on May 4-6; the Joe Goode 
Performance Group, unveiling the Disaster Series, an interdisciplinary dance 
piece that uses natural disasters as metaphors for contemporary relationships, 
May 18-20, and playwright Holly Hughes, author of last year's Neofest offering 
"Dress Suits to Hire," who will perform a new monologue, "World Without End," 
on May 25-27. A work of visual art is still scheduled to be commissioned. All 
of the presentations except "Maria" and the Stephen Petronio Company, which 
closes the festival, will be presented at Sushi. The Stephen Petronio Company 
will present a dance piece, "In Amnesia," June 2-3 at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about non-traditional casting. Two of the 10 performers in "Growing Up 
Male in America" at the Underground at the Lyceum this weekend are female: Judy 
Milstein, who plays a boy and her partner, and Loren Hecht, who plays the 
piano. If Milstein, who also coordinates the Underground, doesn't look out of 
breath at the show, she should. She will be sprinting from her role in "Six 
Women With Brain Death, or Expiring Minds Want to Know" at the Sixth Avenue 
Playhouse (which has two shows at 6 and 9 p.m. Saturdays) to the Underground 
shows at 10:30 p.m. Friday and 11:30 p.m. Saturday. The show will return March 
10-11 after skipping Feb. 24-25 for "White Whines," a spoof of yuppie life, and 
March 3-4, for "Sexes and Others," a gander at the gender gap. Women will get 
equal time at "Girl Talk," a look at America from the female perspective that 
is scheduled to open March 31 and run through April.

California dancers are fighting for sweeping changes that would give smaller 
companies a bigger piece of the pie from the California Arts Council, according 
to Tom Corcoran, executive director of the San Diego Area Dance Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"They need another system, since the present one is geared to larger companies 
and presenters," he said. "It calls for a first-come, first-served basis, but 
the big companies plan so far ahead, the smaller ones can never get any of the 
grants. A large coalition of dance companies and other presenters are actively 
lobbying for these changes now. 
</P>
<P>
"We also want more California artists to be funded," Corcoran said, adding that 
the council "should have some concept that promotes California companies. At 
many levels, people are frustrated. Why help New Yorkers?" 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian is another target of the California dance community, 
Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
"For years and years, Gov. Deukmejian has reduced the arts council's budget. If 
we had stayed with what Gov. Brown had given us, we'd be way ahead of 
everyone," he said. "Now we're only 34th in the country. That's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Kodo was just what the doctor ordered for the San Diego Foundation for the 
Performing Arts. Not only did the Japanese drummers turn out to be the biggest 
box-office attraction of the season for the foundation, they gave its 
fund-raising campaign a giant shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
The opening-night gala, which attracted about 225 supporters, brought in 
$91,000 for the evening, netting the organization $66,000. Even more 
significant, as president Danah Fayman noted, was the influx of new money. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we had several new major underwriters for the gala is 
indicative, I feel, of the community's desire to help us in our time of 
financial need." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, as Fayman pointed out earlier, filling seats, not just finding 
sponsors, is the name of the game, 
</P>
<P>
"Raising money is not the problem. We've already raised almost $300,000, and 
that might be enough to assure a new season. But I don't like all the money to 
come from contributed income," she said. "You have to sell tickets, or you 
shouldn't be accepting all that money. All we sold for the Batsheva Dance 
Company was 35%." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean the foundation's future is still in jeopardy? 
</P>
<P>
"No, we're still working hard, and I'm not pessimistic about the future," 
Fayman said. "The foundation did what it had to do by cutting back. We'll still 
have David Gordon" in May, "and we're trying to figure out new things now and 
where to put them. We're looking into other venues for next year." 
</P>
<P>
A contingent of dancers from Three's Company recently returned from a concert 
date in Las Vegas, and, according to artistic director Jean Isaacs, everything 
is coming up roses for the 15-year-old modern dance troupe. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a sold-out house, and we even had to turn away about 100 people when we 
performed at the university. The Las Vegas Gas &amp; Electric Co. sponsored the 
concert, and it really went extremely well," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of good stuff lined up, too," Isaacs said. During a visit to San 
Francisco for a concert April 5-8, she and John Malashock will teach a class. 
"We've hired a booking lady (a first for the troupe), and she's really helping 
us a lot. And we're going to New York in May, so things are really working out 
well for us." 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Wielandt, a 16-year-old soloist with the American Ballet Ensemble, was 
spotted by the second company of the Boston Ballet. The young dancer will join 
the 15-member group during the 1989-90 season when it tours New England on its 
own and performs in major productions with the Boston Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Three other ABE students are headed to Boston this summer. Natalie Cook, 
Christopher MacDougall and Jonathan Chait were accepted into the Boston 
Ballet's summer program. Four of the six scholarships offered by the 
Pennsylvania Ballet summer school were snared by ABE.

$97-MILLION SETTLEMENT OVER MALIBU SLIDE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly five years after one of the worst landslides in state history damaged 
more than 200 houses on Malibu's Big Rock Mesa, area homeowners Thursday gave 
final approval to a $97-million settlement of lawsuits stemming from the slide. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the homeowners announced that 223 of their 240 clients had 
approved the settlement, which will pay property owners an average of $300,000 
each, minus lawyers' fees. The agreement, which required approval of 90% of the 
homeowners by 5 p.m. today, was hammered out last month by attorneys for the 
homeowners, Los Angeles County, the state Department of Transportation and 
dozens of insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gratified," said Richard Norton, one of the homeowners' attorneys. "It 
makes me feel good that after all this time we've been able to accomplish 
something for the homeowners. But it hasn't been a good way to spend half a 
decade." 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the county will pay the homeowners $35 million for damage 
suffered during the landslide, Caltrans will pay $40 million and the insurance 
companies will pay the remaining $22 million. The state's portion must still be 
approved by the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Although they agreed to pay damages, the settlement states that the defendants 
are not admitting responsibility for the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
The property owners who sign the settlement waive any future claims against the 
county, the state and the insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge R. William Schoettler Jr. has ordered all of 
those who did not sign the agreement to come to his chambers this morning and 
explain why they refused to go along with the pact. 
</P>
<P>
The case brought by the 240 property owners does not affect 16 other homeowners 
who still are pursuing claims against the county, state and insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners who attended a Wednesday evening meeting with the judge and 
their attorneys in Malibu said that they signed the agreement reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not right that we have to settle for a lot less money than we 
deserve," said Libby Sparks. "If our home wasn't on Big Rock it would be worth 
about $800,000, but today it's worth less than half that. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement means that there will be no need for the colossal trial that 
originally was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles later this month. The 
proceeding was expected to last two to five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unexpected Deadlock 
</P>
<P>
The settlement appeared in jeopardy as late as last week after meetings between 
attorneys for the homeowners and Los Angeles County failed to break an 
unexpected last-minute deadlock over how many homeowners would be required to 
sign the agreement for it to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners had sued the county and the state for more than $200 million in 
damages for approving development of the Big Rock Mesa area with seepage pits 
and horizontal drains rather than with sewers. They alleged that the county's 
action contributed to a rise in ground water that triggered the September, 
1983, landslide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buildings Collapsed 
</P>
<P>
The slide caused some homes to collapse. About 30 houses were condemned by the 
county and the value of the others, many priced at more than $1 million, 
plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
The county filed more than 300 countersuits against the homeowners, arguing 
that they were to blame for the disaster because they saturated the hillside 
with water from their properties. 
</P>
<P>
But after four years of court battles and then facing the possibility of huge 
damage awards and more than $20 million in legal fees if the case went to 
trial, the county moved to settle the suits.

DESPITE SLIM COUNTY BUDGET, 24 OFFICIALS IN LINE FOR RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a time when Los Angeles County struggles with probable budget cuts and the 
planned layoff of mental health workers, two dozen department heads are in line 
to receive $174,501 in merit salary increases under the county's 
performance-based pay plan. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon, in a report released Thursday, 
has recommended pay boosts ranging from 3% to 12.9% for 24 general managers and 
department heads as part of a management incentive program. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the proposed salary increases, the Board of Supervisors next 
week also will vote on whether to give county department heads and elected 
officials -- including themselves -- a $350-a-month allowance for "professional 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The financial package, which is tied to a similar proposed allowance for court 
judges, is designed to pay for trips to educational seminars, the purchase of 
books and personal computers or for other job-related reasons. But Dixon said 
Thursday there would be few, if any controls, on how the money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite candidly, you can have an individual who didn't spend it on 
(professional development) but will spend it on suntan lotion on the beach," 
said Dixon, who said he still thought the payment was preferable to the paper 
work involved in reimbursements. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed salary increases include a suggested $11,180 pay hike for Eddy 
Tanaka, director of public social services, that would boost his annual salary 
to $105,000 -- and an increase of $10,590 for County Counsel DeWitt Clinton -- 
raising his salary from $99,410 to $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon also lauded the performance-pay program, which affects 1,400 county 
executives and division chiefs, as well as the department heads. "They clearly 
aren't exhorbitant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Program Has Worked' 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the program has distinctly worked," he said. "I think that we 
have a system where people have taken on more work and performed better and . . 
. collectively, (the increases) are reflective that they have done pretty darn 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the salary increases -- the first since Sept. 1, 1987, for 
department heads -- were in keeping with an average 9.5% salary hike most 
county workers received during that same 16-month period. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives of county labor unions said Thursday that they will 
challenge the proposed pay raises, particularly when the county is facing 
probable budget cuts and laying off or demoting several hundred mental health 
workers. "That's obscene," said Henry Walton, director of health services for 
Local 660 of the Service Employees International Union. "That is ridiculous. 
How can the county afford to give raises like this when they are laying off 
people?" 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the largest percentage increase recommended by Dixon was for 
Robert Arias, the county's affirmative action compliance officer, whose salary 
would jump 12.9% from $60,667 to $68,500. The smallest single increase would be 
a $2,002, a 3% raise for Francis Ching, director of the county Arboreta and 
Botanic Gardens.

 3 HELD IN AMBUSH SLAYING OF BOY, 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Harbor City gang members have been arrested 11 months after police say 
they ambushed and killed a non-gang member, a 16-year-old Wilmington boy who 
was walking home from a Lenten youth group at his local church. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Pereda, a high school track medalist and weightlifter, was shot several 
times as he walked home from church last March 22. The suspects were "parked 
there, waiting, not for anybody in particular," Los Angeles Police Detective 
Larry Kallestad said. The motive was "pure gang territorial reasons," the 
detective said. Although Pereda had never belonged to a gang, he "was the right 
age to be a gang member and the suspects chose him because he fit that profile 
and he was in a rival gang neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Kallestad said two of the suspects -- Kevin Stave, 18, of Harbor City, and 
Hector Acuna Garcia, 17 -- were already in custody on other charges. Stave 
faces an unrelated narcotics charge and Garcia, although a juvenile, is being 
tried as an adult along with two other gang members in a double drive-by 
killing in Wilmington last August, Kallestad said. 
</P>
<P>
A 16-year-old youth, allegedly the driver of the murder car, was also arrested.

 FUGITIVE CAPTURED DURING ROUTINE STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the U.S. Marshals Service's 15 most wanted fugitives, a man convicted of 
participating in a 1985 murder-for-hire plot in San Diego that injured an 
Oklahoma lawyer, was captured Thursday during a routine traffic stop in Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Thomas Innie, 38, of Bedford, N.H., was arrested about 10 a.m. as he 
was trying to start his car outside a motel, officials said. A police officer 
who stopped to help became suspicious and discovered through a computer check 
that Innie was wanted by the marshals. 
</P>
<P>
A warrant for Innie's arrest was issued in San Diego on March 7, 1988, when he 
failed to appear in federal court for sentencing in the murder-for-hire case. 
</P>
<P>
Innie appeared briefly Thursday in Los Angeles federal court and agreed to 
allow the marshals to return him immediately to San Diego.

2ND SOUTH-CENTRAL WAVE OF PROSTITUTE SLAYINGS PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIESON HIMMEL and EDWARD J. BOYER, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several prostitutes have been found dead in South-Central Los Angeles, police 
said Thursday, adding that "an effort is being made" to caution women who fit 
the victims' profile "to watch out." 
</P>
<P>
The case is the second involving the serial killing of prostitutes in the area 
in recent years, and the leader of a coalition that prodded authorities to 
investigate the first string of slayings more diligently harshly criticized 
investigators for keeping a lid of secrecy on their probe. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond saying that the victims are called "strawberries" in street jargon 
because they sell sex for drugs, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Lt. 
Fred Nixon would offer no other details of their profile. 
</P>
<P>
"I will confirm that an investigation is currently being conducted on female 
victims who were engaged in prostitution for drugs," Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he would not confirm a television report that all of the victims had 
been shot. 
</P>
<P>
On its newscasts Thursday, KABC-TV reported that at least nine and as many as 
12 prostitutes have been found shot to death over the past three years, a 
period overlapping investigation of the so-called Southside Slayer. 
</P>
<P>
Between September, 1983, and July, 1986, 17 women were found strangled in 
South-Central Los Angeles. Nearly all had been stabbed, and all but a few had 
arrest records for prostitution. One man has been convicted in one of the 
deaths, and two other suspects were charged separately in seven of the 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
The KABC broadcast Thursday cited unnamed sources as saying that evidence shows 
conclusively that all of the killings now being investigated were committed by 
the same man. 
</P>
<P>
The killer first struck in August, 1985, when a prostitute was found shot to 
death in an alley off West Gage Avenue, the station reported. Another victim, 
found last September, was 17, the report added. 
</P>
<P>
Investigation of the slayings has been handled quietly, without any publicity, 
the KABC report said, because police officials feared protests from residents. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the community protested what they called the lack of progress in the 
earlier series of slayings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say without equivocation that our reluctance to publicize (the killings) 
has nothing to do with (a fear of) any major demonstrations," Nixon said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He would not confirm any of the KABC report, saying that "the mere publicity in 
this investigation would hinder our efforts. We are just not able to supply any 
more details." 
</P>
<P>
But Margaret Prescod, founder of the Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial 
Murders, said that the police handling of the investigation "feels as though 
history is repeating itself. Eleven women were already murdered before they 
called a press conference to tell us about the Southside Slayer." 
</P>
<P>
Prescod's organization has been widely credited with prodding the Los Angeles 
City Council and the county Board of Supervisors to offer rewards for 
information leading to the arrest of the Southside Slayer, or slayers. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition was also a constant thorn in the side of the Police Department, 
initially losing no opportunity to chastise investigators by calling them less 
than diligent because most of the victims were prostitutes and were black. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is outrageous that the LAPD did not come to the community. The 
community is in the best position to help solve the murders." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Sheriff's Department said homicide investigators knew of no 
cases in their jurisdiction such as the slayings being investigated by Los 
Angeles police. He added, however, that a more "complete" statement would be 
issued today.

BUCKEY MAKES HIS 1ST TRIAL APPEARANCE AS FREE MAN; 'STILL NUMB' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in nearly five years, McMartin defendant Raymond Buckey 
walked into the courtroom as a free man Thursday, rather than as a prisoner 
brought in from jail. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old key defendant in the Manhattan Beach preschool molestation case 
was released from Men's Central Jail late Wednesday, after defense attorneys 
and friends posted a $3-million property bond and arrangements were made for 
him to live in an undisclosed location under 24-hour security guard. He had 
been behind bars since March, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still in a numb state," Buckey said, sitting stiffly in the section of 
seats reserved for reporters while waiting for his trial to resume. 
</P>
<P>
Smiling but taciturn, he was dressed neatly in a conservative gray suit, pink 
shirt and striped tie. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 62, are charged with 65 counts of 
molestation and conspiracy involving 11 children who attended the family-run 
nursery school. Charges against five other McMartin teachers have been dropped 
by the district attorney, who cited insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey said he has not yet fulfilled his first wish -- to see the ocean again 
-- but celebrated his first night of freedom eating dinner in a Chinatown 
restaurant with his attorney, Danny Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember emotional feelings that everybody out there takes for 
granted. I've been isolated in a nightmare," Buckey said. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, who is free on $295,000 bail, said there are no immediate plans for 
a family reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"That'll come later, and I hope it'll be soon 'cause I want him to see his 
gram," she said, referring to his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, 81, a former 
defendant in the once-massive case who is reportedly in ill health. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey is being accompanied by Paul Barron, an armed defense investigator, and 
a second guard who declined to identify himself. Barron said he is in charge of 
arranging for round-the-clock security for Buckey, one of the conditions of his 
release. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey has said he is concerned about threats made against him and his family 
and said he planned to keep some distance between himself and his family for 
their safety. 
</P>
<P>
"I still realize there are people out there who have gone off the deep end," he 
told a television reporter just after his release. 
</P>
<P>
Other conditions of Buckey's release imposed by Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge William Pounders include a prohibition against contacting any children or 
families who have accused him of molestation, a requirement that he not enter 
the coastal area where he grew up -- Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach or Redondo 
Beach -- or leave the state, that he not have verbal or physical contact with 
anyone under 14, unless the child is a blood relative or accompanied by a 
parent, and that he refrain from drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders told jurors that the fact that Buckey had made bail "has nothing to do 
with (his) guilt or innocence." Outside their hearing, the judge indicated that 
he was dismayed that news media had been tipped off to the defendant's pending 
release, creating "a circus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mob Scene 
</P>
<P>
He said the news media mob scene outside the jail Wednesday night reminded him 
of the live televised slaying of President John F. Kennedy's assassin, Lee 
Harvey Oswald, by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby in 1963. The shooting 
occurred while Oswald was being moved by law enforcement officials past a 
throng of reporters and others. 
</P>
<P>
"What I saw on television reminded me of Jack Ruby's assassination attempt," 
Pounders said. "There was obviously the presence of a lot of people allowed to 
get that close." 
</P>
<P>
Asked by a television reporter whether he looks forward to testifying in his 
own defense, Buckey said: "Yes and no. I don't look forward to getting up there 
and saying something and then having people twisting the simple truth, but I 
definitely look forward to saying what I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
He will have several months to adjust to his new freedom before testifying, 
however, as the defense has presented few of its key witnesses and is expected 
to call physicians to refute medical evidence presented by the prosecution and 
psychologists to address the issue of children's susceptibility to suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
On the witness stand Thursday was Ray Fadel, owner of Harry's Market, alleged 
to be the scene of some molestations. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, now in its 22nd month, is expected to last into the fall.

HATE CRIMES IN COUNTY ON RISE, PANEL REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINGER THOMPSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Renteria of West Hollywood often walks to the grocery store in the 
evening -- never really worried about getting mugged, but always cautious. 
</P>
<P>
But one night a couple of months ago he let his guard down. 
</P>
<P>
"My friend Peter and I were a couple of blocks from my house with the groceries 
in our hands when all of a sudden I felt this club hit me in my temple," said 
Renteria, 27, a hair stylist, who said he is homosexual. "My jaw was broken in 
two, and after I fell to the ground I got kicked and kicked and kicked. I 
thought I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
The attackers did not take Renteria's money or groceries and never uttered a 
word during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
After the assault, Renteria said, the attackers looked down on their bloody 
victims, laughed and directed homosexual epithets at them. 
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Thursday, members of the County Commission on Human 
Relations said they are alarmed by the increasing number of hate crimes being 
committed throughout Los Angeles County. The number of hate crimes has 
increased since the commission began recording them in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the crimes are acts of vandalism such as graffiti or 
defacement, the number of violent crimes is escalating, especially racially 
motivated crimes and crimes against homosexuals, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The number of racially motivated assaults or attempted assaults increased 
nearly 5% over 1987, according to the report, while "gay-bashing" accounted for 
the majority of hate crimes committed against homosexuals -- 64%. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately homophobia is still the most widely accepted form of hatred in 
this society," said Tom Coleman of the Gay and Lesbian Community Services 
Center. "People think of homosexuality as a dirty secret and that it's OK to 
attack homosexuals because society is ashamed of them anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the 23-page report, which lists the 267 hate crimes that were 
reported in the county last year, were gathered from law enforcement agencies, 
community groups and religious organizations, said Eugene Mornell, executive 
director of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Racially motivated violence increased from 16 recorded incidents in 1987 to 23 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, Stewart Kwoh of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center said those 
figures are the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
"We know for a fact that many victims, particularly in the Latino and Asian 
communities, do not report crimes to police because they come from countries 
where they learned not to trust police," Kwoh said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 65% of the racially motivated crimes listed in the report were 
committed against blacks and included incidents such as pit bulls being set 
loose on black children in Pacoima early last year and the summertime shooting 
of an 18-year-old black man in Playa del Rey by a white gunman. 
</P>
<P>
To help stop such incidents, the county commission recommended that law 
enforcement agencies thoroughly investigate the incidents and prosecute hate 
crimes as felonies whenever possible.

The Central Valley Regional Center, which serves as the major referral 
placement agency for thousands of developmentally disabled people in the San 
Joaquin Valley, could be forced to close its doors in April. Warren McEwen, 
director of the center, said he expects the agency and 20 others like it 
throughout the state to shut down in April because of a lack of operating 
funds. He said most of the Central Valley Center's 164 employees, who work in 
Fresno, Madera, Merced, Mariposa, Tulare and Kings counties, will be laid off 
if the center is forced to close. McEwen said a glitch in state funding will 
apparently force the centers to close in April, leaving about 90,000 
developmentally disabled people in the state without services.

The leader of Colombia's most active leftist guerrilla group asserted that 
insurgent groups control one-fourth of that Latin American nation. The claim 
was made in a letter to former President Alfonso Lopez Michelson from Manuel 
Perez, a former Roman Catholic priest who commands the National Liberation 
Army. The letter, published in several Colombian newspapers, was received by 
Lopez on the same day earlier this week that Perez's guerrillas reportedly 
ambushed two river boats in northern Colombia, provoking a clash that killed 10 
servicemen and 20 guerrillas.

Lebanon's rival Christian militias agreed to halt fighting for the second time 
in as many days. The militias issued separate statements in Beirut, saying they 
had agreed to stop the battles and to meet today to discuss ways of healing 
widening political rifts. This latest agreement, like the one the day before, 
was mediated by the Maronite Christian church. At least six people were killed 
and 20 wounded in the fresh fighting, security and hospital sources said, after 
the two sides -- in defiance of that earlier truce -- began fighting with 
artillery, mortars, rockets and machine guns in residential areas.

A disgruntled bank employee who opened fire on his co-workers, killing three of 
them and then himself, had an extensive history of psychiatric treatment, 
officials said. Emanuel Tsegaye, 33, a bill collector who worked for Chevy 
Chase Federal Savings Bank's credit card center in Bethesda, Md., had been 
quietly feuding with supervisors for weeks, co-workers said. Officials of the 
Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said that Tsegaye had been 
treated at a maximum-security psychiatric hospital for more than two years 
after threatening a police officer. He was declared criminally insane. 
Officials speculated that Tsegaye's mental problems began in his home country 
of Ethiopia, where he was hospitalized for depression in the 1970s.

EX-SKIPPER ACQUITTED OF 1 CHARGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Alexander G. Balian, on trial for failing to rescue a boatload of 
Vietnamese refugees, was acquitted Thursday of a charge stemming from the death 
of a refugee who jumped from the disabled junk and drowned in the South China 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Balian, the former skipper of the U. S. warship Dubuque, still faces two 
charges of disobeying orders and dereliction of duty. 
</P>
<P>
After Navy prosecutors rested their case Thursday, Capt. James A. Freyer, the 
judge presiding over the court-martial, said there was insufficient evidence to 
prove that Balian was guilty of violating Navy regulations when he failed to 
rescue the refugee who jumped. Freyer entered a directed verdict of not guilty 
to the charge, so it will not be considered by the jury of six Navy captains. 
</P>
<P>
Balian's lawyer, Dan Donato, had requested the directed verdict, arguing that 
there was no trace of evidence that Balian was informed that a swimmer was 
floundering in the water. Even if Balian had known the swimmer was in trouble, 
"there was no way he could have prevented it," Donato said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Already Dead 
</P>
<P>
Freyer agreed, saying he could not see how a "reasonable person" could convict 
Balian based on the evidence presented by the prosecution. He said the 
testimony and ship's logs indicated that, before Balian and the others on the 
bridge of the amphibious transport dock received reports of a body in the 
water, the refugee was already dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The impression I'm left with is that the whole thing happened very quickly," 
Freyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The swimmer was among four refugees who jumped from the junk and tried to swim 
to the Dubuque as it approached the junk about 9 a.m. last June 9. The swimmers 
were thrown life rings as they neared the Dubuque, but they were not allowed on 
board. The swimmer who died drowned while he was still near the junk, according 
to most of the witnesses who saw him jump. The other swimmers, wearing the life 
rings from the Dubuque, made it back to the junk alive. 
</P>
<P>
Navy prosecutors contended Thursday that, as soon as the refugees jumped into 
the water, their lives were in danger and Balian had an obligation under Navy 
regulations to rescue anyone in danger at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"When those refugees started jumping off the craft, (Balian) had an obligation 
to render assistance and no assistance was rendered," said Lt. Michael J. 
Wentworth, a Navy prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
The judge let stand a charge in which the Navy alleges that Balian violated a 
regulation when he failed to assist one of 
</P>
<P>
the swimmers who tried to climb a rope hanging from the Dubuque, but was shaken 
off by crew members. During the weeklong trial, crew members have given 
conflicting accounts of that part of the incident. Some said Balian ordered the 
crew to shake the refugees off the lines and others said no such order was ever 
given. Several refugees who were hanging on the lines said in written 
statements presented Thursday that they were simply lowered back into the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
In the other remaining charge, the Navy alleges that Balian disobeyed orders 
and was derelict in his duty for failing to properly assess the condition of 
the refugees and give them adequate assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Balian ordered that the refugees be given food, water and directions, but 
decided, after crew members viewed the refugees from a small motorboat, that 
the junk was seaworthy and could reach land without further assistance. 
However, the refugees drifted for another 19 days after the Dubuque left for 
the Persian Gulf and have said they resorted to cannibalism after their food 
ran out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Marines Testified 
</P>
<P>
Before prosecutors rested their case Thursday, they called several Marines to 
the stand to testify about what they saw when they set off in a small rubber 
boat to deliver supplies to the junk. The Marines described a desperate and 
chaotic situation. They did not report much of what they saw, they said, and 
were never debriefed by Balian or any Navy personnel when they returned to the 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
Balian has blamed the crew for giving him inadequate and erroneous information 
that led him to believe it was not necessary to pick up the refugees. An issue 
that the court-martial panel will consider is whether Balian should be held 
responsible for the apparently poor communications among his crew. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Staff Sgt. Jeffrey Morton described an older man on the junk who spoke 
English with a French accent and said, "I can't take any more of this." The man 
said they had been at sea for about 20 days, and a number of people had already 
died. 
</P>
<P>
According to other testimony, that man swam away from the junk the night before 
the refugees were rescued by Philippine fishermen and is presumed drowned. 
</P>
<P>
Marine 1st Lt. Mark Wild said the refugees were "thin, dirty and tired. They 
were excited about us being there, and they were crying out to us." Wild said 
some refugees begged for help by holding their hands in front of their faces, 
palms together, as if in prayer. "Others were thanking us in smiling," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the Marines loaded food aboard the junk, the refugees "began grabbing it and 
passing it back and stuffing it in their shirts," he said. "A lot of the food 
was being devoured immediately. People had their hands full of rice and were 
pushing it into their mouths." 
</P>
<P>
A third Marine, Cpl. Graham Cocksedge, said the refugees "looked real skinny." 
One wasn't moving at all and some weren't going for the food, he said. He added 
that he saw some refugees fighting over oranges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution and defense lawyers agreed Thursday that, instead of hearing the 
testimony of scheduled refugee witnesses, lawyers will read into the record the 
statements of six who described their voyage, which began in Ben Tre in 
southern Vietnam last May 22 aboard a junk so crowded that they were unsure how 
many people were there. Some paid as much as $2,500 for what they thought would 
be a four-day trip to Malaysia. Instead, it turned into a 37-day odyssey during 
which more than half of the approximately 110 on board died or were killed for 
food. 
</P>
<P>
But they said in the statements that they were grateful to Balian and to the 
United States for helping them, when as many as 50 merchant ships from other 
countries saw them and passed them by.

UCSD CHANCELLOR CALLS FOR NATIONAL PROGRAM TO AVERT PH.D. SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego Chancellor Richard C. Atkinson on Thursday called for the creation 
of a fellowship program to encourage more graduate students in science and 
engineering to pursue Ph.D.s and prevent a threat to the U. S. economy and 
defense in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the University of California Board of Regents, Atkinson, in 
prepared remarks, warned that "there is an increasing demand for Ph.D.s that 
will not be met by the supply." Government participation will be necessary to 
fill the critical shortage, Atkinson said, because the private sector can play 
only a limited role. 
</P>
<P>
In the decade beginning with the year 2000, the United States will need about 
18,000 new Ph.D.s each year, but the nation's universities will be producing 
only about 12,000, Atkinson said. Of these, about 5,000 will be non-citizens, 
and 70% of them will remain to work in this country, leaving only about 10,500 
new Ph.D.s a year. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of Ph.D.s, which Atkinson said will become evident in five years, 
"will have devastating consequences for colleges, universities, business and 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage more science and engineering graduate students to pursue 
Ph.D.s, Atkinson called for the federal government to establish a national 
fellowship program for graduate students at an annual cost of $300 million. He 
envisions a massive research program in the sciences and engineering much like 
the one begun by the government after the Soviet Union launched its first 
Sputnik satellite in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
"The program should provide appropriate incentives for college students 
considering graduate work; a fellowship of $25,000 per year for four years of 
study would be a strong attracter for potential Ph.D. students," he said. "To 
deal only with the shortfall in the natural sciences and engineering, at least 
3,000 new fellowships per year would be needed." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Ph.D.s awarded annually by U. S. universities go to foreign 
students. According to Atkinson's figures, foreign students receive 60% of the 
Ph.D.s in engineering, 50% in mathematics and 30% in the physical sciences. 
</P>
<P>
American academia is also suffering from the shortage of Ph.D.s and is in 
danger of losing its "intellectual capital," he said. He predicted that U. S. 
universities will compete heavily with government and private industry to 
recruit Ph.D.s for the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Many faculty members are quickly approaching retirement and will need to be 
replaced. Atkinson said Ph.D. faculty members in the sciences and engineering 
are retiring at a rate of about 2,000 a year, but that figure will increase to 
more than 4,500 per year in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The need to replace a large number of retiring faculty, combined with an 
increasing demand in the public sector, suggests that academia will have 
serious problems in recruiting faculty in the near future," Atkinson said. 
</P>
<P>
This acute competition for Ph.D.s could have a serious effect on "second-tier" 
colleges and universities, he said. "The top research universities may be able 
to compete for the best people. . . . Second-tier institutions probably will 
experience serious difficulties in attracting and holding faculty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson also warned that "a bidding war between industry and academia . . . 
would have serious consequences for the nation's economy and defense." 
</P>
<P>
The projected shortage of Ph.D. faculty could result in a "corn seed problem," 
he said, " . . . because it is the scientists and engineers in the academic 
community who do our basic research and train future generations of scholars 
and researchers." 
</P>
<P>
In order to stave off the looming shortage of Ph.D.s, more junior high school 
students need to be encouraged to major in the sciences and engineering, 
Atkinson said. The next boom in the college-age population will begin at the 
turn of the century, and young people who will receive Ph.D.s in 2004 are now 
in junior high.

CAUGHT IN CULVER CITY; 
</P>
<P>
MISSING MURDER-PLOT FIGURE ARRESTED

A 38-year-old man, wanted by federal authorities for failing to appear for 
sentencing after his conviction in a 1985 murder-for-hire case in San Diego, 
was arrested in Culver City Thursday during a routine traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Thomas Innie of Bedford, N.H., was arrested about 10 a.m. Thursday 
while trying to start a car when a Culver City police officer who stopped to 
help became suspicious and ran an identification check, Culver City Police Lt. 
Wally DuVal said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caught in Computer Check 
</P>
<P>
A computer check showed Innie to be on the U. S. marshals' 15 Most Wanted list 
for failing to appear at his sentencing in connection with the 1985 attempted 
murder of Robert L. Barr III, an Oklahoma City attorney who was defending a 
victimized creditor in a fraudulent oil investment scheme, Deputy U. S. Marshal 
Patrick Hattaway said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego resident Brian Boeckman and his father, Robert Boeckman of Oklahoma 
City, ran the oil investment scheme, according to Robert Lloyd, a U. S. marshal 
case agent. When some unhappy investors sued the Boeckmans, the Boeckmans hired 
two men to kill Barr, the investors' attorney, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said the two hit men were Charles Worack and Vernon James, and that they 
went to Oklahoma City looking for Barr, unsuccessfully. When the Boeckmans 
ordered them to try again, Worack backed out and James brought in Innie on the 
plot, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
James and Innie returned to Oklahoma City, where James shot Barr through his 
bedroom window and left him for dead, Lloyd said. Barr suffered multiple wounds 
in the face, chest and legs, but survived. James was sentenced last February to 
15 years in federal prison for his part in the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Innie was among several people indicted in San Diego federal court on charges 
that included conspiracy to commit murder for hire, Lloyd said. Innie pleaded 
guilty to a lesser charge of one count of interstate transportation of a 
firearm by a convicted felon but failed to show up for his sentencing on March 
7, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said Innie was convicted in 1972 for a probation violation in New 
Hampshire and had other convictions dating to 1968 for burglary, larceny and 
possession of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
After he was arrested Thursday, Innie consented to a search of the Culver City 
motel room where he was living, police said. They found two handguns, equipment 
to manufacture methamphetamine and pipe bombs, and about six quarts of liquid 
methamphetamine, DuVal said. 
</P>
<P>
Innie was brought to the Metropolitan Correction Center in San Diego from Los 
Angeles Thursday night. He is expected to be sentenced on the original 
conviction and to face an additional charge of failure to appear for 
sentencing.

COOLING TREND WILL SET TONE FOR THE WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today will be a lot like yesterday and tomorrow will be a little like today. 
That may sound like a cryptic message from a fortune cookie, but weather-wise 
it's perfectly clear -- at least until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny skies and moderate temperatures similar to Thursday's will continue 
today, but a cooling trend from the Pacific Northwest and clouds moving in 
tonight will set the tone for the rest of the weekend, National Weather Service 
forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
A 20% chance of drizzle or light rain is predicted for Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The cooling trend will not present anything "really serious," Shigehara said, 
but added that the thermostat's weeklong effort to rise above 60 degrees will 
be lost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Pressure System 
</P>
<P>
"We struggled all week to get above 60 degrees, and, just as we started to warm 
up Wednesday and level off, an incoming high-pressure system will knock it down 
again this weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon did report a high of 66 on Thursday, but Lindbergh Field was a brisk 
60, about 6 degrees cooler than normal for this time of year, Shigehara said. 
In fact, the coast and inland areas had trouble rising above the mid-50s all 
week -- although no records were broken -- and frost repeatedly blanketed 
agricultural areas at night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been complaining to us for days now about the weather. These cool 
temperatures are a continuation of a pattern we've had for the past five 
months." 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen a normal temperature this month yet," Shigehara said. "It's 
not people's imaginations that it's cold. We're averaging 3 degrees below the 
norm right now." 
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-usual temperatures have caused a dramatic increase in natural 
gas use, and conservation measures were taken last week to avert a shortage, 
said Tom Murnane, a spokesman for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week there was a danger that we might have a natural gas shortage, so we 
took the very unusual step of asking residential customers to conserve, in 
addition to curtailing our commercial and industrial customers," Murnane said. 
"We asked them to set their thermostats at 60 degrees instead of the normal 68 
and to wear a sweater or take other steps to warm up." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no problems this week," he said. "The situation has improved." 
</P>
<P>
Murnane said that natural gas consumption on Valentine's Day was 265 million 
cubic feet, up 125 million cubic feet from Valentine's Day last year. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal and inland highs today will range from 60 to 66 degrees, dipping to 56 
to 62 on Saturday and to 55 to 60 on Sunday, Shigehara said. Low clouds will be 
noticeable by tonight and dominate most of Saturday, except for brief sunshine 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight lows for the coast will be between 45 and 52 tonight and Saturday 
night. Lows both nights for the inland areas will range from 35 to 45. 
</P>
<P>
The ocean temperature is 54. The surf is at 3 feet and may rise to 4 feet by 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains will be clear, with highs today ranging from 45 to 50, decreasing 
to 38 to 46 Saturday and from 35 to 40 degrees Sunday. Lows will range from 23 
to 28 tonight and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Today's highs in the deserts will be 68 to 75 and 64 to 70 Saturday.

MAN ARRESTED AFTER 'BORROWING' PORSCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man put a pistol in a Mission Beach woman's face and took her silver Porsche 
928 Thursday, saying he needed it to save his brother's life and that he would 
bring it back in half an hour, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Gonzalez, 42, pulled into her garage on Ocean Front Walk about 4:30 
p.m. with two small children in the car and found the man waiting for her, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I'm sorry, I just need your car. I'll bring it back in half an hour. 
I need it to save my brother's life,' " police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
Gonzalez and the children were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
During that half hour, the man got into a drag race with another car. Police 
said they saw the car in front of an apartment complex in the 4500 block of

laundry room in the complex. They found a loaded, .32-caliber pistol and 
Gonzalez's purse in the car.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A high-speed chase involving Carlsbad police, sheriff's deputies, San Diego 
police and two alleged car thieves ended early Thursday in La Jolla when the 
stolen vehicle crashed into an embankment, the Carlsbad Police Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The chase, which at times exceeded 100 m.p.h., began about 5 a.m. on Elm Avenue 
when a Carlsbad officer stopped the driver of a late-model Dodge for a broken 
taillight. When the officer approached the car, the driver sped south on 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired a warning shot as the car sped away, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County sheriff's deputies and San Diego police officers joined the 
chase, which ended when the suspects exited I-5 onto La Jolla Village Drive and 
careened off an embankment, the spokesman said. They were caught after a foot 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Ezell, 24, of San Diego and David Chicoine, 25, address unknown, were 
taken to Sharp Memorial Hospital, where they were listed in good condition. 
Ezell suffered minor cuts on his face, and Chicoine suffered a broken left arm, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Both are under protective custody and will be taken to County Jail, where they 
will be booked on suspicion of auto theft.

HERMOSA TO VOTE AGAIN ON LOAN TO CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan for Hermosa Beach to provide its city manager with a $250,000 mortgage 
-- approved by the City Council at 1 a.m. Wednesday -- has generated so much 
criticism that the councilwoman who cast the deciding vote is forcing a 
reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman June Williams said Thursday that she placed the matter on the 
agenda for the next regular council meeting Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Williams vowed to switch her vote if residents still seem heavily opposed to 
the loan, which was proposed to help City Manager Kevin Northcraft afford a 
house in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is "very disturbed by the public's perception" but added: 
"Personally, as a taxpayer, I still think it's a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Aired on TV 
</P>
<P>
The vote came late at night at the end of a packed council agenda, with only a 
handful of residents present for the 15-minute discussion. The meeting was no 
longer being aired on local cable television. 
</P>
<P>
The loan proposal passed by a vote of 3-2, with Mayor Jim Rosenberger, 
Councilman Chuck Sheldon and Williams in favor, and council members Etta 
Simpson and Roger Creighton opposed. The council also voted to raise 
Northcraft's salary by 9% -- from $65,000 to $70,850 -- but that has generated 
little criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said opposition to the mortgage loan "spread like wildfire" through 
the city Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I started getting a lot of objections, and I finally determined that this 
would put a pall over everything," she said. "For years, everybody would be 
saying the city bought him a house. . . . These stories get around town to 
where they get so out of proportion. So I just think it's not a good idea, 
based on the citizens' perception." 
</P>
<P>
Both she and the other backers of the proposal blamed the criticism on the lack 
of public discussion, which they say got short shrift because of the late hour. 
They say the loan has been misunderstood by residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precedent Cited 
</P>
<P>
Those in favor say the loan is a good deal for both Hermosa Beach and 
Northcraft, who lives in El Segundo, where he once was assistant city manager. 
Those opposed say providing a mortgage for a city official would set a bad 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman Creighton, who voted against the pay raise and the loan: "I 
look at it this way. The guy got a $20,000 increase in pay by moving from 
Suisun City to Hermosa Beach, and that's enough. . . . If we've got enough 
money to be loaning for housing, why don't we give a tax refund?" 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the plan calls for the city to act as a mortgage banker for 
Northcraft, who came to Hermosa Beach a year ago from Suisun City in Northern 
California. The concept is not a new one; three years ago, the city of 
Inglewood loaned its city manager $275,000 to help him buy a home. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Hermosa Beach agreement, the city would be the first 
lien holder on Northcraft's house, meaning that if Northcraft defaulted, the 
city would own the property -- a valuable asset in a place like Hermosa Beach, 
where real estate prices are high. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated that the house would cost Northcraft about $400,000 
and that he would provide a 40% down payment from the sale of his El Segundo 
house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10% Interest Rate 
</P>
<P>
The loan would come from the city's investment fund. It would carry a 10% 
interest rate, about 1% lower than banks are charging on 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages but more than the average 8.6% the city is earning on its funds. 
</P>
<P>
The loan would be amortized over a 30-year period but would not be equivalent 
to a 30-year fixed-rate loan. The city would have the right to call it on 120 
days' notice, and the rate would come up for renegotiation in five years. The 
city would not charge Northcraft closing fees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly an investment," said Rosenberger. 
</P>
<P>
"The city, in terms of its investments, is supposed to consider three things: 
safety, liquidity and yield," he said. "This loan is appropriate on all three 
criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberger likened the offer to something a corporation would do for its top 
executive and said it has the added benefit of helping Northcraft become a 
Hermosa Beach resident. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Simpson, who cast one of the two votes against the plan, said 
it goes against city investment policy and would set a precedent for all city 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she said, the 120-day call provision gives the appearance of 
extending Northcraft's contract, which can be terminated with only 30 days' 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Idea 
</P>
<P>
Northcraft, reached by telephone in Monterey, where he is attending a League of 
California Cities conference, said Thursday that he initially proposed the loan 
when the city hired him a year ago. He said city officials told him then that 
they were reluctant to make such an offer before he came to work for them. 
</P>
<P>
Northcraft, who has three children, rented a house in Hermosa Beach when he 
took the city manager's position. He already owned the house in El Segundo but 
did not move into it until his tenants left. 
</P>
<P>
About a month ago, Northcraft raised the mortgage issue again. He said Thursday 
that he had found a home he would like to buy in Hermosa Beach and had put his 
El Segundo house on the market. He also said he is seeking financing for the 
new house from several lending institutions and that the city's offer is so 
close to market rates that he may be able to find something comparable in the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Northcraft said that whether or not the council rejects the loan, he believes 
it is an idea that should be considered when hiring top-level city employees in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
"With the housing market in California, it is something more and more cities 
are doing," he said. "When we hire a critical department head in the future I 
want to keep the concept in mind."

APARTMENT PLANS DIVIDE CITY, SCHOOL OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battle lines are being drawn between the Torrance Unified School District and 
the City Council over a district plan to build up to 120 apartments on the site 
of the former Columbia School. 
</P>
<P>
The district's interest in developing the 5-acre, triangular lot on 186th 
Street has raised harsh criticism from council members, who question the 
density of the project and fear it could include subsidized housing -- a 
politically hot issue in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where they're headed, but I see potential problems," said 
Councilman Bill Applegate, who last week asked city staff to investigate the 
district's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
The council's criticism comes despite assurances by district officials that 
they do not intend to provide subsidized housing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Never' Part of the Plan 
</P>
<P>
"Subsidized or low-income housing has never been a part of our plan," said Paul 
Mackey, assistant superintendent for special projects. "I don't know why they 
are worried." 
</P>
<P>
Columbia School, which once provided classes for mentally and physically 
handicapped children, has been vacant since 1987, when the program was 
relocated to Torrance High School. Columbia is one of several schools that were 
closed as enrollment declined. Some of the unneeded schools were sold or 
converted to other district uses. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Oelkers, the district's assistant superintendent for business services, 
said criticism of the project is premature because the specifics of the project 
have not been determined. The council would have to approve a change of zoning 
for the project as well as the actual development. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not sneaking off in the middle of the night and building something 
without anyone knowing," Oelkers said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to develop the land would be a joint venture between the district and 
the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, Oelkers said. The 
agency develops public-owned land and provides real estate advice to other 
public agencies at a nominal fee, said Judith Kendall, the commission's 
director of community development and planning. 
</P>
<P>
In July, school officials asked the commission to evaluate the vacant property 
and recommend how to get the highest financial return. The commission said the 
most profitable use would be a high-density apartment project, according to a 
report by Oelkers to the school board. The district is considering building 
about 120 two- and three-bedroom apartments on the site, Oelkers said, which 
would require a high-density zoning. 
</P>
<P>
"The case can be made that R-3 zoning (high-density housing) is compatible with 
both the adjacent commercial zoning and the R-2 (medium-density housing), and 
addresses a shortage of multifamily housing within the city," Oelkers said. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been estimated how much the development may cost, but Oelkers said 
the district plans to borrow all of the money needed. He estimated that the 
profits to the district over a 10-year period could be as high as $13.5 
million. The land alone is worth about $4.5 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the project is completed, a private agency would be hired to manage the 
property, Oelkers said. 
</P>
<P>
State law, however, requires that any profits from the sale of school lands go 
toward building improvements or purchase of other property, Oelkers said. By 
developing the Columbia site instead of selling it, the district can use the 
profits for operating expenses or any way it wants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Get the Most Out of the Property' 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to get the most out of the property that you can," Mackey said. 
</P>
<P>
Most council members said they sympathize with the district's attempt to raise 
money, but several -- including Applegate, Dan Walker and Tim Mock -- said they 
fear that if the school board uses federal or county grants to pay for the 
project, it may be required to provide low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate said subsidized housing could bring down property values in the 
neighborhood. The area north of the site has medium-density, single-family and 
two-family homes. The area to the south and east is commercial. To the west are 
railroad tracks. Applegate said his opposition to subsidized housing, which has 
often served minorities, is not racially motivated. "It has nothing to do with 
race or anything else," he said. "It has to do with the value of property." 
</P>
<P>
Walker shared Applegate's concern. Even though district officials have said 
they do not intend to provide subsidized housing, he said, "that doesn't give 
anyone any assurances that they won't build it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Subsidized housing is a sensitive issue with the City Council. In 1980, four 
council members faced recall petitions because they voted for a federal Housing 
and Urban Development subsidized housing project in order to continue receiving 
federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with overwhelming opposition from residents, the council ultimately 
dropped out of the federal housing program. The recall effort was ultimately 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"It caused quite a fury," said Mayor Katy Geissert, who was one of the council 
members who faced a recall drive. 
</P>
<P>
Other council members said they opposed the project because they say it would 
be too dense for that neighborhood. "I don't think that is the best use of the 
land," said Councilman Mark Wirth. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council asked city planners to recommend a new zoning for the 
site, which is now zoned for public use. Their recommendation is expected in 
several weeks. Wirth said he would prefer to rezone the land for medium density 
and have moderately priced, owner-occupied townhouses built. 
</P>
<P>
The district's interest in developing housing is shared in Redondo Beach, where 
the elementary school district is working with developers to build two senior 
citizen homes, one at the old McCandless Elementary School site and the other 
on the site of the former Andrews Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance District officials said a similar project is under way in Huntington 
Beach.

S. J. DIAMOND: NOTARIES, PUBLIC CAN BE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone needing something notarized used to go to the corner bank or savings and 
loan or maybe a neighborhood realty office. Now those places often say there is 
no notary public in the office. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be the case. They're there, "but they're hiding," says Charles 
Faerber, vice president of the National Notary Assn. in Canoga Park. Notaries, 
like everyone else, have had their share of lawsuits, and to limit their 
liability, says Faerber, they limit their work to documents involving their 
employer. 
</P>
<P>
Notary work, oddly, takes little training or expertise and makes little money, 
but is indispensable. Like the ancient scribes from whom they're descended (the 
Roman "notarius" among them), modern notaries serve society as official 
witnesses to oaths and contracts. Indeed, says Faerber, "every civilized nation 
has some kind of government-appointed impartial witness to make sure that 
somebody is who they say they are on important documents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Varies by State 
</P>
<P>
Notaries of old also drew up documents and later stored them, and in many 
countries today, notaries have similar authority and commensurate training. In 
the United States, the field, it's said, has been "democratized"; most of our 4 
million notaries just take oaths and affidavits, or witness signing of trust 
deeds, loan papers and other documents, checking the signer's identity. 
</P>
<P>
But it's variable. In several states, notaries can perform marriages; in 
Louisiana, they can draft legal documents (indeed, many are lawyers); in 
Pennsylvania, they handle transfers of car titles. Similarly, to become a 
notary in some states, says Milton Valera, president of the NNA, "you just buy 
a stamp." Florida's 350,000 notaries fill in an application and pay $25. 
California's 150,000 notaries must be fingerprinted, can miss only two 
true-false questions on a 15-question, open-book test of information from a 
printed pamphlet, and need a surety bond of $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Easily won and ill-paying (top fees run $5 per notarized signature), the 
notary's position is nevertheless sensitive. If notaries are willing to 
notarize when the wrong person, or no person at all, appears before them, they 
can abet a lot of white-collar crime -- illegitimate title transfers, odometer 
fraud, boat theft (this a Florida problem), insurance fraud. In border cities, 
unscrupulous notaries capitalize on the quasi-legal role of the notario in 
Latin American countries, charging for immigration "counseling" and documents 
available free elsewhere, even promising immigrants legal status they can't 
deliver. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Careless 
</P>
<P>
Some notaries are not criminal, but careless. A few years ago, California's 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu reported that of 4,000 cases of alleged 
notarial misconduct, "over 90% . . . stem from carelessness on the part of the 
notary public." Typically, said the report, the notary failed to require the 
signer's presence (often, says Faerber, taking a boss's word about the 
signature) or failed to establish the signer's true identity, or to keep the 
notary seal out of strange hands. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints to California's Notary Division about alleged misconduct are 
investigated, and a notary's license could be suspended or revoked. In many 
states, however, the entity that grants the commissions has neither 
investigative personnel nor authority to suspend. 
</P>
<P>
Notaries everywhere have been subject to lawsuits, threatening in both number 
and size, and resulting in higher premiums for the liability insurance that 
many notaries now buy. Some challenged industry practice -- a 1981 California 
appellate decision, for example (Allstate Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Lotito), 
which found a notary negligent for notarizing a signature on a grant deed that 
was later labeled a forgery. Lotito, like most notaries, relied on such paper 
proofs of identity as drivers licenses and passports: The court, drawing on an 
1872 statute, said a notary must personally know the signer. 
</P>
<P>
"For several weeks," says Valera, "notarization essentially came to a halt," 
given the impossibility of knowing all customers in today's society. The case 
left a residue of anxiety about the nation's outmoded notary statutes, although 
California's Legislature, among others, immediately passed a law allowing 
notaries to rely on such documents for identification. 
</P>
<P>
Even more threatening were the lawsuits "where notaries were thrown in just 
because their name appeared on a document," says Faerber. The largest was a 
$660-million suit involving a San Diego notary who had notarized a project 
manager's signature on legal interrogatories involving an accident at a 
construction firm. The honesty of the interrogatories was later challenged, and 
the notary included among the defendants only because his name appeared on the 
document in question; although he was ultimately dismissed from the suit, he 
had to hire a lawyer and defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defensive Notaries 
</P>
<P>
One result of all the questions about notaries' activities is more aggressive 
state regulation. Thirty three states now require surety bonds that give 
customers some recourse when a notary is negligent, and some are increasing the 
value of the bond required, says a spokesman for Western Surety Co. in Sioux 
Falls, S.D. Many states are revising their laws or regulations on notaries: In 
Florida, for example, a governor's commission is looking into complaints 
against notaries, whose positions have no educational requirements and whose 
activities are not policed. 
</P>
<P>
Another result is defensive notaries, those notaries-in-hiding who "have heard 
of other notaries being sued," says Faerber, "and are very wary." There seems, 
however, to be some ambivalence about this wariness; trade press and trade 
experts continually warn of the danger of unjustified lawsuits, while they 
reiterate that notaries who mind the P's and Q's of required procedure have 
nothing to fear. 
</P>
<P>
None of this explanation is much help to the person who needs a notary on some 
business that doesn't directly involve his bank, his attorney or his realtor. 
Preferring to deal, as before, with an impersonal but familiar institution, he 
must look around his own company for notaries, or try one of the independent, 
on-call notaries who advertise in the phone books in larger cities. 
</P>
<P>
The public might well question how many notaries now are really notaries 
public, while notaries ask how public they can be when they're held liable for 
making reasonable judgments about the identity of strangers.

THRIFTS IN STATE PUSHING INTEREST RATES ON BIG CDS UP NEAR THE 10% LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interest rates on certificates of deposit in California are beginning to 
approach 10% for the first time since the mid-1980s, as savings institutions 
try to catch up with high rates on Treasury bills and money market funds and 
respond to last week's hike in the prime lending rate. 
</P>
<P>
Some smaller thrifts in California have recently raised rates on their 
six-month jumbo CDs -- those requiring deposits of close to $100,000 -- to as 
high as 9.75%, said Robert K. Heady, editor of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm 
Beach, Fla., newsletter that tracks CD rates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he said, jumbo CD rates offered by top-paying institutions nationwide 
increased about one-quarter of a percentage point this past week. That came in 
response to Friday's half-point increase in banks' prime lending rate to 11% 
from 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Californians will be receiving 10% on jumbo CDs by mid-year" if consensus 
predictions on further interest rate hikes come true, Heady said. 
</P>
<P>
Such a rate scenario would be welcome to many savers who have in recent weeks 
shifted deposits at a record pace out of the nation's crisis-ridden S&amp;L 
system into alternative investments, including Treasury bills and money market 
funds, which have been paying their highest rates in years. Short-term 
Treasuries still pay more than short-term CDs on average, but in the past two 
or three weeks, savings institutions have been closing the gap, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift institutions as a group lost $8.1 billion in deposits in December -- a 
record for any month -- and the outflow is believed to have continued in 
January, although official government figures are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
The most aggressive of the rate hikes have continued to be at smaller thrift 
institutions, and generally involve only jumbo CDs. 
</P>
<P>
Retail CDs -- those generally requiring minimum deposits as low as $1,000 -- 
still average below 9% on shorter maturities. The average yield for six-month 
retail CDs, for example, is 8.48% nationally, up 0.07 percentage points from 
the previous week, according to Bank Rate Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
Such increases are consistent with the pattern of increases following other 
recent prime rate hikes, Heady said. 
</P>
<P>
As such, they have not triggered a rate war in California similar to one that 
may be brewing in Texas, where one aggressive institution, Commonwealth Savings 
in Houston, has been offering a 10.75% rate. However, it reportedly has backed 
down from that lofty level, cutting its rate by one percentage point on 
Thursday, Heady said. 
</P>
<P>
If a rate war were to erupt in California, it could further boost the costs of 
the Bush Administration's recently unveiled thrift bailout plan, under which 
some 224 insolvent thrifts will be taken over in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Institutions forced to match aggressive rate increases may see their profit 
margins eroded, which could in turn put more of them into financial trouble and 
erode all S&amp;L profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just generally a drag on the financial system," said Alan Whitney, 
spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the insurance fund that is 
overseeing thrifts that are being taken over. 
</P>

In the past, weaker institutions often paid the highest rates in order to 
attract deposits. However, that is becoming less true, as only one of the five 
California thrifts paying the highest rates on six-month jumbo CDs -- Founders 
Savings in Los Angeles -- is considered to be insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bank Rate Monitor, three California thrifts now offer six-month 
jumbos at 9.75%: First Network Savings Bank in Los Angeles, Pacific Coast 
Savings in San Francisco and County Savings Bank in Santa Barbara. Two others, 
Butterfield Savings in Santa Ana and Founders, were at 9.5%. 
</P>
<P>
At the three largest California banks, Bank of America, Security Pacific and 
Wells Fargo, rates also have taken off in the past week, said Norberto Mehl, 
chairman of Banxquote Money Markets, a New York rate information service. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield on six-month CDs at the big three has risen to 8% from 7.73%, 
while one-year certificates rose to 8.2% from 7.9%, Mehl said. While that still 
is low relative to competitors, a rise that large previously would have taken 
weeks, he said.

FORD POSTS RECORD INCOME DESPITE DOMESTIC SLUMP 
</P>

A big rise in fourth-quarter profit drove Ford Motor Co. to its third 
consecutive record earnings performance in 1988, Ford said Thursday. The 
results led to the most profitable year ever for Detroit's auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
But Ford's industry record $5.3 billion for 1988 included weaker profits on its 
U.S. car and truck sales and slippage in its growing financial-services 
division. The No. 2 auto company's vast overseas operations more than accounted 
for the 15% earnings increase from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings in the October-December period fell a bit short of Wall Street's early 
projections, but at $1.16 billion still outpaced the year-ago quarter by 24% 
and were Ford's highest ever for the period, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and Ford executives blamed the U.S. auto earnings dip chiefly on the 
cost of auto sales incentives pushed by Ford and other car firms late last year 
and sharply higher costs for such raw materials as aluminum, copper and 
plastics. 
</P>
<P>
But the quarterly and full-year results marked a continuation of Ford's 
striking financial performance as the company outstripped earnings at bigger 
General Motors for the third straight year. Attention has shifted to how long 
Ford can maintain this showing. Constraints on production capacity and the 
likelihood of a slightly smaller U.S. market for cars and trucks this year have 
already prompted some analysts to lower their earnings forecasts for Ford in 
1989. Ford built 17% of its cars on overtime last year. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, their problem is their own success," said David Healy, auto 
analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New York. "They've gotten to the point 
where they're selling all the cars they can build and they've run out of room 
for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Ford, which had to close dozens of U.S. assembly and parts factories and lay 
off tens of thousands of workers during the slump of the early 1980s, has so 
far resisted pressures to launch any major capacity expansion despite its 
successes of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with GM's strong 1988 profit of nearly $4.9 billion and Chrysler's 
decline to $1 billion, the Ford financial report pushed Detroit's net earnings 
to $11.2 billion, the highest since four years earlier when the Big Three 
earned $9.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The results came amid a strong domestic market that saw Americans buy 15.8 
million cars and trucks last year, the third highest on record. But Ford's 
results underscored the U.S. companies' difficulty in making money at home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 7.2% increase in the number of cars and trucks it sold here last 
year, giving Ford the highest domestic market share in a decade, U.S. auto 
profits fell almost 10% to $2.5 billion. Overseas, earnings roughly doubled to 
$2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ford has long led its U.S.-based competitors in overseas markets, especially 
Europe, which was credited with keeping the company in business in the early 
1980s when domestic operations were hemorrhaging red ink. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Profit Sharing 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Ford said it managed a steep rise in earnings in Europe, the 
Asia-Pacific region, Mexico and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in domestic automotive profits will mean a drop from last year's 
industry record profit-sharing payments to its U.S. workers. Industry sources 
said the payout was expected to average between $2,100 and $2,500 per worker, 
compared to the previous year's $3,700 per worker. 
</P>
<P>
Ford is to announce the exact figure today. David McCammon, Ford treasurer and 
vice president for finance, would only say Thursday that it would be somewhere 
between $2,100 and $3,700. 
</P>
<P>
It will far exceed the profit sharing checks already announced by GM, averaging 
$254 per worker, and Chrysler, about $720 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Ford reported a 19% decline in earnings by its financial services division, 
whose main components are Ford Motor Credit and First Nationwide Financial 
Corp. The division earned $691 million last year, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed the decline on lower net interest margins and higher credit 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Ford ended the year with $9.2 billion in cash on hand, and recently announced a 
25% rise in its annual dividend to $2.40 a share. Chairman Donald E. Petersen 
said Thursday that the company will spend "substantially" more in the next five 
years than its 1984-88 capital spending of $19 billion, but did not elaborate.

U.S. SHOULD PRESS TOKYO FOR IMPORT TARGETS, PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A high-level business panel recommended Thursday that the United States abandon 
its traditional approach to trade relations with Japan and instead press Tokyo 
to meet industry-by-industry targets for increasing its import buying -- on 
pain of U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which serves as the principal business advisory group to U.S. 
Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, declared that the new approach is needed 
because the removal of most of Japan's formal trade barriers in recent years 
has not spurred enough import buying. 
</P>
<P>
It said most of the barriers now faced by U.S. business are the result of 
cultural differences, such as loyalty of Japanese conglomerates to their 
long-time suppliers, and cannot be resolved by traditional "piecemeal" 
barrier-lowering by government. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's 121-page report conceded that its prescription -- which was coupled 
with a parallel call to reduce the budget deficit -- would amount to a major 
departure from traditional U.S. policy and would come close to a system where 
trade is "managed" by governments. 
</P>
<P>
But it asserted that "given the different structures of the two economies, 
trade policy solutions lie somewhere between free trade" and a "managed trade" 
system. It said trade policy must become "results-oriented," designed to 
achieve specific goals. The group, headed by James D. Robinson III, chairman of 
American Express, is known formally as the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy 
Negotiations and is set up under U.S. trade law to provide business leaders 
with a voice in setting trade policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Managed-Trade' System 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's report marks the first time that the panel has formally recommended 
abandoning traditional free-trade objectives in relations with any country and 
moving toward a managed-trade system. The recommendation is intended to apply 
only to trade with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Hills, who has been in office for barely two weeks, declined to comment on the 
specific recommendations contained in the report. A spokesman for her office 
said Hills would study the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, trade negotiations with Japan would continue in a 
traditional fashion wherever formal trade barriers -- such as import quotas or 
inequitable government regulations -- exist in either country. Officials would 
meet and negotiate a solution. 
</P>
<P>
But where the barriers stem from differences of economic structure or culture 
-- such as the reluctance of Japanese companies to buy imports -- then the two 
sides would agree on medium-term targets for increasing import buying in these 
industries and then take steps to meet them. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy implies that the Japanese government would seek to prod Japanese 
companies into buying more imports by issuing "administrative guidance" from 
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and other forms of pressure 
that are common in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Deficit Cut Urged 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the United States would seek to "enforce" those targets by 
threatening to impose tariffs or other penalties if the agreed-upon goals were 
not met. The approach has been recommended previously by some private analysts 
but is regarded skeptically by others. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for establishing new industry-by-industry targets is only one of 
several suggestions that the panel included. It also urged reducing the U.S. 
budget deficit, both to slow import buying in the United States and to dampen 
demand at home so that industry can export more. 
</P>
<P>
And it urged Japan to stimulate demand at home, in part by overhauling its own 
economic structure. It urged both countries to explore ways to change their tax 
structures to enhance their broader economic goals. 
</P>
<P>
The panel specifically rejected several other frequently mentioned proposals, 
including establishing broad targets for reduction of the U.S. and Japanese 
trade imbalances and negotiating a free-trade arrangement similar to that 
recently signed with Canada.

The founder of Mexico's largest brokerage has declared his innocence on charges 
of illegal trading and criminal fraud following his arraignment at a Mexico 
City prison. "I hope there will be justice. I'm innocent. I believe in the 
Mexican laws," said Eduardo Legoretta, chairman and a founder of Operadora de 
Bolsa, said after being arraigned at the city's Eastern Penitentiary. Legoretta 
and three other top brokerage officials were arrested Monday and later charged 
with illegal trading related to the October, 1987, Mexican stock market crash.

New World Entertainment reported discussions concerning an unidentified party's 
"possible interest in acquiring the entire company." The Los Angeles-based 
independent movie and television producer said that "no decision has been made 
regarding any such transaction." The statement was prompted by a spurt in 
trading of New World's shares, which have sent its price up 60% to $5 over the 
last three days.

U.S. MAY EASE NEW RULES FOR HEALTHY S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
BILLIONS IN 'GOODWILL' TO COUNT AS CAPITALIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Savings and loan associations, struggling to meet tough new capital standards 
by 1991, will be allowed to count much of the $20 billion in "goodwill" already 
on their books, congressional sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, seeking to ease the burden of the new standards on 
healthy S&amp;Ls that are striving to stay in business, has indicated that it 
will accept goodwill as part of its calculation of S&amp;L capital reserves, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
If goodwill -- the monetary value assigned to the name, locations and 
traditions of a business -- is counted, healthy S&amp;Ls would need to raise 
$14 billion in new capital to reach the standards that will take effect in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
This is a daunting task for a business already under economic and political 
pressures. Without goodwill, however, the industry would need $34 billion, a 
figure that industry officials say would be impossible to raise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Will in Congress 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, as part of his plan to rescue depositors at insolvent, 
federally insured savings institutions, proposed last week that S&amp;Ls be 
required to maintain cash reserves equal to 6% of their assets as of 1991, up 
from 3% today. His purpose was to enhance the soundness of surviving thrift 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said they have received general assurances that the 
Administration will accept legislative amendments recognizing the value of 
goodwill for currently healthy S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration denied making a specific promise. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not made any commitment on that," a Treasury spokesman said Thursday. 
"It is something for the regulators to sort out." 
</P>
<P>
But the congressional sources said Administration officials have expressed 
strong sympathy and concern for healthy S&amp;Ls during private meetings with 
congressional staff members. The officials "recognize the capital requirements 
are unrealistic for a lot of institutions," one congressional aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many S&amp;Ls have so much goodwill on their books," this aide said. "The 
Treasury is willing to 'grandfather' the S&amp;Ls, to count the goodwill toward 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
A regulatory official, informed of the development, said: "This would relieve a 
good part of the burden on the healthy institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bush Administration legislative package, the capital requirement for 
S&amp;Ls as of 1991 will be the same one that will apply to banks. Banks cannot 
now include goodwill in their computation of their capital reserves. 
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 3,100 S&amp;Ls nationwide, of which about 600 are 
either insolvent or perilously close. The remaining 2,500 institutions could 
attempt to remain open if they can meet the 1991 standards. 
</P>
<P>
These 2,500 institutions now have capital of $57.3 billion, including the $20 
billion attributed to goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
They're Not Lining Up 
</P>
<P>
Under the 6% rule, these institutions would need to raise their capital to $71 
billion as of 1991, an increase of $14 billion. Without counting goodwill, the 
S&amp;Ls' capital would be just $37.3 billion, and they would need to seek a 
massive $34 billion in new money. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a very long line of people waiting to put money into S&amp;Ls," 
one congressional source said. "The job of raising money won't be quite as 
formidable if you can count goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
Today's healthy S&amp;Ls have increased their goodwill in recent years as they 
have acquired weak ones -- along with their goodwill. "A lot of big 
institutions did acquisitions, encouraged by the federal regulators," an 
industry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Those acquisitions, by strengthening the industry, worked in the interest of 
federal regulators. The industry says the regulators should reward the healthy 
S&amp;Ls by letting them count their goodwill toward their capital 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), a House Banking Committee member who has been strongly 
critical of the industry, said there are "some compromises that can be 
achieved." He mentioned phasing out the inclusion of goodwill over time or 
including only a percentage of goodwill toward meeting the capital standard. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great scandals is the weak capitalization of the thrift industry," 
Leach said.

FDA CHALLENGES CARNATION'S DATA ON INFANT FORMULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Food and Drug Administration has asked Carnation Co. to submit new data to 
substantiate the claims that its new infant formula is less likely to trigger 
allergies after the agency found flaws in the company's original research. 
</P>
<P>
The questions surrounding the Carnation product, called Good Start, has led the 
FDA to request information from the makers of other formulas that also claim to 
reduce the chances of allergic reaction to cow's milk. 
</P>
<P>
Pediatricians have also voiced their concern about the formulas labeled 
"hypo-allergenic." They say the products, which reduce, but do not eliminate 
the potential for causing allergies, may mislead many mothers into believing 
the formulas are allergy-free. The FDA has given Carnation 60 days to supply 
new information regarding the allergy reduction claims of its Good Start 
product. "We told Carnation, through their lawyer, that the studies to support 
the hypo-allergenic claims don't pass muster," said FDA spokesman Emil Corwin. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin said the Carnation studies claimed Good Start could alleviate such 
symptoms as spitting up, runny noses and colic linked to milk allergy and 
intolerance. "But it was not supported by some of the data in the study," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation spokesman Dick Curd said: "We are now supplying greater detail on 
what we have already given them and supplying additional results." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Carnation, the FDA requested more detailed information on similar 
products sold by Ross Laboratories, which makes Alimentum, and Bristol-Myers, 
maker of Nutramigen. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy comes only three months after Los Angeles-based Carnation, a 
subsidiary of Nestle, launched Good Start -- for infants allergic to milk and 
soybean-based formulas -- in a drive to win a share of the $1.6 billion that 
Americans spend annually on infant nutrition products. 
</P>
<P>
Good Start is made from whey, which is a component of milk. A sister product, 
Good Nature, is designed for infants who have begun to eat solid foods. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation, which estimates 40,000 babies use Good Start, says it has received 
six medical reports so far of adverse reactions by infants who were fed Good 
Start. The company said that in each of the six cases, the infant had a severe 
milk allergy or other physical reaction. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in April, Good Start packages will point out that the product offers 
"reduced potential for allergic reaction. No formula, including ours, is 
nonallergenic." The company will also warn mothers not to use Good Start if 
their infants have suffered from anaphylactic shock or other severe reaction 
triggered by another formula. 
</P>
<P>
Hypo-allergenic formulas are unsuitable for the 1% of infants who are allergic 
to cow's milk, say pediatricians. "Mothers should recognize that this is not 
allergy free," said Birt Harvey, president-elect of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. "That's our concern. If the infant is truly allergic to cow milk, 
those severe allergic reactions could occur just the same with these 
hypo-allergenic formulas." 
</P>
<P>
The academy has updated its members on the subject in the February issue of its 
newsletter. "There is no evidence to support the use of (hypo-allergenic) 
formulas for the treatment of colic, sleeplessness and irritability," the 
newsletter said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, pediatricians opposed Carnation efforts to market and advertise the 
product directly to mothers, a move the academy said would undermine breast 
feeding. Carnation later agreed to drop its name from such ads after meeting 
with academy officials.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: CONTROLLING GROWTH IS HARD BUT NECESSARY

The new, cranberry-colored Jaguar parked outside Bob Sidell's massive 
Chatsworth office attests to his company's success as a mail-order cosmetics 
marketer. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, last year 450,000 customers purchased $12 million worth of California 
Cosmetics' SilkSkin skin care products -- a 50% increase over sales the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of introducing the four new products he planned to release this 
year, Sidell and his partner, Paula Levey, recently decided to introduce one 
product and deliberately limit the 3-year-old firm's growth. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Because Sidell, a former Hollywood makeup artist, said he has watched too many 
small cosmetic companies fail when their owners became greedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw companies disappear because they got a taste of the dollars and thought 
they just needed more products to sell," said Sidell. 
</P>
<P>
Unchecked growth can destroy a company faster than sluggish sales, says Eric G. 
Flamholtz, a management consultant and professor at UCLA. "Fifty percent of 
entrepreneurs fail because they have no product or market for their products," 
said Flamholtz. "Twenty-five percent fail because they choked on their own 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
He points to the quick demise of Osbourne Computers, which sold $100 million 
worth of portable computers in its second year and declared bankruptcy in its 
third year. Flamholtz considers sales growth beyond 50% to be "hyper-growth." 
</P>
<P>
"Hyper-growth happens when entrepreneurs get hooked on their own adrenaline," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Too many small business owners lose control of their companies by focusing on 
sales growth rather than profits, said Flamholtz. "A company should ask if it 
is stronger at the end of the year than it was at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
To help companies diagnose their growth problems, Flamholtz designed a 10-point 
checklist. He suggests spending a few minutes thinking about how your company 
works and then respond to each statement yes or no. The score depends on the 
number of yes responses. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have one to three yeses, you are OK," said Flamholtz. "Three to five 
means there are some problems. More than five is real serious. And, if you said 
yes to all 10, run -- don't walk -- and get some help." 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that more companies follow Sidell and Levey's example by 
restricting and managing growth before it causes problems. But, he said, most 
growing businesses wait until disaster strikes to take action. 
</P>
<P>
Sidell said he decided to apply the brakes for several reasons. Because the 
company has never borrowed a penny, it has relied on cash flow to fuel its 
growth. If the growth continued at the 50% rate, it would have been impossible 
to keep up without borrowing money. 
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to limit new products was also based on the fact that it 
costs about $150,000 to develop a new product, not counting advertising and 
marketing costs. Adding a new product, if it succeeds in the highly competitive 
cosmetic industry, means paying for expensive packaging and building inventory. 
</P>
<P>
The partners are also reluctant to expand the 51-person staff if it means 
pulling inexperienced people "off the street," Sidell said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of spending money to attract new buyers, they are devising ways to 
encourage existing customers to buy more products. Now, the average order is 
$45.40, Sidell said. 
</P>
<P>
"The same money spent on a full-page newspaper ad can be used to produce a 
quarterly newsletter for our 450,000 customers," said Sidell, who tracks 
company operations by computer on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
California Cosmetics' emphasis on customer service is evident in a computer 
program Sidell had developed to send customers a card, a set of makeup brushes 
and gift certificate on their birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the ultimate would be to stop advertising and still sustain the 
business," said Sidell, who began developing products while he was doing the 
makeup for the young actors on the television show "The Waltons." 
</P>
<P>
Between the Waltons and California Cosmetics, Sidell developed and sold another 
line of products through beauty supply companies. Through the years, he has 
worked with cosmetic chemists to develop a line of skin-care and tanning 
products for men and women. He relies on other companies to manufacture his 
products using his formulas. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, cutting the growth rate does not mean reducing annual sales. Even 
though Sidell is limiting new products and cutting advertising costs, he 
projects that sales may reach $16 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

BANK PENALIZED FOR NOT SERVING POOR AREA

A Federal Reserve Board decision that for the first time penalizes a bank for 
failing to serve poor neighborhoods appears to signal a new willingness by 
regulators to enforce a 12-year-old law against such practices, community 
activists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed rejected a request by the Chicago-based Continental Bank Corp. to 
purchase a small Arizona bank because, it said, Continental had not fulfilled 
its duties under the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to meet 
local credit needs, including those in poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The law, on the books since 1977, is aimed at preventing "red-lining," the 
practice of denying loans to an entire neighborhood based on the predominant 
race or economic class of its residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is the beginning of a trend," said Allen Fishbein, general 
counsel of the Center for Community Change, a Washington-based group concerned 
with housing and community development. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's 14-month-old petition to acquire Grand Canyon State Bank in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., was rejected on a 4-2 vote Wednesday, with board members H. 
Robert Heller and John LaWare opposed. Edward W. Kelley Jr. did not vote.

Stock prices nudged ahead Thursday, easing some from a morning rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 7.50 to 2,311.43, on top of a 
22.68-point gain Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stock trading was cautious ahead of today's report on the December merchandise 
trade deficit, which will guide financial markets by indicating whether U.S. 
goods are too costly abroad. Economists predict that the U.S. trade gap 
narrowed to $11.8 billion in December from $12.5 billion in November. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'll see people making bets until tomorrow," said Tom 
Gallagher, head trader at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't make too many solid assumptions with this trade figure coming 
tomorrow morning. People tend to play their cards a little close to the vest," 
added Tom Callahan, Yamaichi International senior vice president in U.S. 
equities. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks shrugged off news of a surprisingly robust gain in U.S. housing starts 
last month, indicating that the economy continues to boom and interest rates 
may be raised to ward off inflation, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
New construction of houses and apartments surged 8.0% in January to an almost 
two-year high, the Commerce Department reported in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Advances outnumbered declines by more than 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of 
issues listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.45 million shares, up from 
154.22 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. stock rose on rumors the company may be a takeover 
candidate. Saatchi, the world's largest advertising agency, closed up 1 3/4 at 
22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Gains 
</P>
<P>
Church's Fried Chicken climbed 1 1/4 to 10 1/4 in active trading. The company 
agreed to be acquired by A. Copeland Enterprises for $11 a share in cash and 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Merck rose 1 to 64 3/4 following word that researchers at the company have 
found what they describe as a promising approach toward combating the virus 
that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 2 1/4 at 110 3/4; 
DuPont, up 1/8 at 97 7/8; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1/2 at 91 1/8; Eastman 
Kodak, up 1/4 at 47 5/8, and Coca-Cola, up 3/8 at 48. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola raised its quarterly dividend from 30 cents a share to 34 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of New York rose 5/8 to 42, hitting a 52-week high. The company said it 
expects annual earnings growth of 15% to 20% through 1991, somewhat more than 
its historical targets. 
</P>
<P>
Navistar International held steady at 6 1/8. The company posted profits for its 
fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31 of 12 cents a share, against 15 cents a 
share in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index fell from its latest record high as 
cautious investors began selling. The 225-issue Nikkei index, which climbed 
166.59 points to a record closing of 32,149.48 on Wednesday, fell in the 
afternoon trading that left the index at 32,083.58 at the close, down 65.0 
points 
</P>
<P>
London Stock Exchange prices fell amid continued concern about the outlook for 
world interest rates as traders sat back to await today's release of British 
inflation figures. The Financial Times 100-share index ended 13.7 points down 
at 2,033.8.

HAWAII SHOWS SDSU WHAT 'BETTER' MEANS 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the season, San Diego State was considered by the conference coaches to 
be one of the up-and-coming teams in the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, in their second season under veteran Coach Jim Brandenburg, were 
expected to field their most competitive team in five seasons and possibly 
break into the upper half of the standings. 
</P>
<P>
But after a 73-60 loss to Hawaii Thursday night in front of 3,261 at the San 
Diego Sports Arena, it is clear that it is the Rainbows, not the Aztecs, who 
have solidified a position as one of the conference's emerging teams. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Hawaii's fourth in a row, its longest winning streak in nearly 
three seasons, and assured the Rainbows of their first winning season since the 
1982-83 team finished 17-11. Hawaii (15-9, 8-5 in WAC play) is in third place, 
only 1 1/2 games behind first-place New Mexico (16-7, 9-3). 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Aztecs' ninth in their past 11 games, dropping them into 
eighth place and setting up a matchup for last place Saturday at Wyoming 
(11-14, 3-8). 
</P>
<P>
This was a game the Aztecs (10-13, 4-9), despite falling behind 8-0 in the 
first 4 minutes, had a chance to win, but they threw the opportunity away with 
a series of turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We just stopped executing our offense," senior forward Shawn Bell said. "We 
wanted this game real bad. We played hard. But just broke down when it 
counted." 
</P>
<P>
The wasted opportunities came after the Aztecs, having drawn as close as three 
points on eight occasions, drew to within two at 46-44 with 10:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But SDSU turned the ball over on five of six possessions -- three in a row -- 
during a 3 1/2-minute stretch to give the Rainbows an opening. Hawaii used the 
breaks to go on a 7-2 run and take a 53-46 lead at 5:54. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them too many easy baskets off transition," Brandenburg said. "We 
didn't do a good job of getting back at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs did pull to within six points at 61-55 with 2:26 to play, but the 
Rainbows scored 12 of the last 17 points on their way to their first sweep of 
the two-game season series since 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Terry Houston's 19 points led five Hawaii players in double 
figures. Houston also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Michael Best had 20 points and 7 rebounds for the Aztecs. Senior 
center Mitch McMullen had a career-high 14 rebounds and added 9 points, but his 
effectiveness was limited by foul trouble that kept him on the bench for the 
final 8:48 of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen's difficulties were matched by the troubles of Reggie Cross, Hawaii's 
leading scorer and rebounder. Cross, who played only 23 minutes because of foul 
trouble, was held to six points, 14.3 below his average and only the second 
time this season he has been held out of double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two guys neutralized each other with all the pushing and banging 
underneath," said Riley Wallace, Hawaii's second-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs, as they have done in several games of late, wasted no time putting 
themselves behind. They missed their first eight shots from the field and first 
two from the free throw line in falling behind, 8-0, in the first 4 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii made the Aztecs' comeback task more difficult by applying a soft 
fullcourt press designed more to keep SDSU from getting comfortably into its 
offense than to force turnovers. Wallace said the pressure was a reaction to 
the Aztecs' loss of point guard Bryan Williams, who was suspended for the 
season after his arrest last week for petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State concludes its home schedule next week with nonconference games 
against Florida International Wednesday and U.S. International Saturday.

JIM MURRAY: THE POINT IS, ISIAH THOMAS TAKES CHARGE

<TEXT>
<P>
Quick now, who are the great quarterbacks in the game today? Joe Montana, you 
say? Dan Marino? Boomer Esiason? Bernie Kosar? Randall Cunningham? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I've got a quarterback who can make those look scatter-armed. He never 
throws an interception. He's got a completion record that could make Terry 
Bradshaw sit down and have a good cry. He's got the peripheral vision of a 
shark. If you think Fran Tarkenton was hard to contain, you should see this 
guy. He not only makes the ball disappear, he does, too. 
</P>
<P>
Who is this remarkable phenom, you ask, and why isn't he in the shotgun for 
Dallas? 
</P>
<P>
Well, how about Isiah Thomas? 
</P>
<P>
Wait just a minute, you say. Isiah Thomas isn't a quarterback, he's a point 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, yeah? Well, watch him now as he comes up the floor of the Forum against the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, he's got the ball. A good quarterback has to have the ball and 
Isiah Thomas always has the ball. He seems to come with it attached. 
</P>
<P>
He brings it up with this kind of bemused look on his face. He kind of glides, 
slips, wheels from side to side. He dribbles it right into the feet of guys a 
foot taller than he is. If they over-play him, he's gone. Fran Tarkenton never 
spurted past Deacon Jones any niftier. 
</P>
<P>
He gets the beginning of this little grin around his mouth. He's wary, crafty, 
probing for an opening. He's looking for the open man. Every good quarterback 
does that. 
</P>
<P>
When he finds one, he whistles this deadly accurate pass to him, usually right 
under the basket. A good quarterback in the NFL completes 55% of his passes. 
Thomas' percentage is more like 100. 
</P>
<P>
If no one is open, he bounces the ball once, twice, pumps, fakes -- and then 
soars in the air to pop in a basket himself. This quarterback leads the team in 
scoring, too. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't dare leave him alone," sighs opponent Magic Johnson. "Give him room, 
he shoots. No matter where he is." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he popped in 38 three-point baskets, most on the team and well over 
a third of those he tried. He is as dangerous as Wyatt Earp. He shoots off 
balance, on balance, at mid-court, under the basket. Last year, he threw in 25 
points in a single quarter against the Lakers in the sixth game of the finals. 
He once scored 16 points in a minute and a half when the Knicks sagged off him. 
</P>
<P>
He is ubiquitous. Find the ball and you find Isiah. It is the opinion of some 
coaches around the league that there are two of him. They swear that, some 
night, he's going to get an assist and a basket on the same play. 
</P>
<P>
He led the world in assists one season with 1,123, a record since broken by 
Utah's John Stockton. He still had a 21.2-point scoring average for that year. 
He is unselfish. A quarterback's job is to win games, not trophies. 
</P>
<P>
It is a rule of thumb in football that you can't get to the Super Bowl without 
a Grade A quarterback. It is a rule of thumb in basketball that you don't get 
to the playoff finals without a dominating center. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons get there because they have Isiah Thomas. The league is 
lucky he's not paired up with Patrick Ewing or the season might be a foregone 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons are not a blow-you-out-of-there team. They rely on trapping 
(double-team) defenses, quickness and resourcefulness. They jab you to death, 
beat you on points, win on a split decision. They give a party when they score 
more than 100 points. But so does the team they play. You think something is 
wrong with the scoreboard when the Pistons play. 
</P>
<P>
I always thought Oscar Robertson was the best quarterback, or floor general, I 
ever saw on a basketball court. Oscar was like a traffic cop out there. But 
Isiah Thomas can do most of the things Oscar could do. And remain less visible. 
</P>
<P>
But the point is, Isiah Thomas not only can do things Oscar Robertson could do 
but the things John Elway could, too -- take your team to the championship 
finals on the strength of your arm and the elusiveness of your feet. The 
Raiders should be so lucky.

HERSHISER GETS 3-YEAR, $7.9-MILLION CONTRACT; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS AND THEIR ACE REACH ACCORD WITHOUT ARBITRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long after the start of Thursday morning's arbitration hearing was delayed 
to allow negotiations to continue, pitcher Orel Hershiser reached agreement 
with the Dodgers on a three-year, $7.9-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
The package includes a $1.1-million signing bonus and salaries of $2.4 million 
in 1989, $1.6 million in 1990 and $2.8 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The $7.9-million contract is the largest in baseball history, excluding those 
that include long-term deferments and real estate provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's average annual salary of $2.63 million, including the prorated 
signing bonus, is also the largest, edging the $2.5 million that Boston Red Sox 
pitcher Roger Clemens will receive from the three-year, $7.5-million contract 
he agreed to Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who made $1.1 million in 1988, could also become the first player to 
receive $3 million for one season, earning $3.1 million on a prorated basis in 
1991. He was seeking a 1989 salary of $2.425 million in arbitration and the 
Dodgers had filed at $2 million, both figures being arbitration records. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was averted when the sides agreed on a compromise involving the 
1990 lockout language, which Hershiser and his attorney, Robert Fraley, 
described as the principal stumbling block throughout negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
In the new contract, Hershiser, who wanted his 1990 salary guaranteed in the 
event of an owners' lockout, seemed to make the pivotal compromise by accepting 
the Dodgers' language. He will not be paid during a work stoppage by either the 
players or clubs as a response to the collective bargaining negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser agreed to that provision after the Dodgers increased the amount of 
the signing bonus, decreased the money at stake in 1990 and increased the total 
package to a figure that Fraley said was "close to what we always had in mind." 
</P>
<P>
Fraley added: "It's structured properly now. We took the heat off 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers apparently wanted Hershiser to accept a smaller signing bonus and a 
provision that would have allowed an arbitrator to decide if he should be paid 
in the event of a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs call that neutral language, but Fraley cited an arbitrator's ruling 
against the players in the 1981 work stoppage and said: "It's not neutral at 
all. There's strong precedent for believing we couldn't have won in 
arbitration." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's arbitration was scheduled to begin at an airport area hotel at 9:30. 
An agreement was reached at about 10:30, after Fraley and Bob Walker, the 
Dodgers' attorney, re-opened their talks at 9 and asked arbitrator Stephen 
Goldberg to delay the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent impetus for continuing the negotiations stemmed from a nine-hour 
meeting between Fraley, Walker and Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice 
president, that began early Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets' signing of Dwight Gooden to a three-year, $6.7-million 
contract and the signing of Clemens on Wednesday generated significant movement 
in the talks, Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about two of the premier pitchers in baseball," Claire said of 
Clemens and Hershiser. "You can't have one signing without an impact on the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Sox were buying out one year of free agency (the third year of 
Clemens' contract) and we were buying out two." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser, who was eligible for free agency when the 1989 season ended, said it 
was a possibility he would have had to consider. His hope, however, was to stay 
with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"In a negotiation like this, you try to take the sentiment out," he said. "You 
try to do what's best for your family and yourself. It's all business. I 
understand that. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I can get back to feeling warm and goosey about being a Dodger. It's a 
fantastic feeling to have it out of the way. I can concentrate on baseball. I 
don't have to worry about free agency." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser was 23-8 in 1988, ended the regular season with a record 59 straight 
scoreless innings, and had a 3-0 record with a save in postseason play when he 
was voted most valuable player of both the NL playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he will face greater pressure because of the new contract, Hershiser 
shook his head and said he has been asked that question ever since he hit the 
$1-million mark and thinks he supplied a definitive response amid the pressure 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not predicting anything except a top effort," he said. "I give the same 
effort every time I put the uniform on. I've never equated a pay stub with 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
Asked, too, if he thought his image has changed, if he was surprised by the 
criticism from fans and some writers, Hershiser said: "Surprised, no. Unhappy, 
sure. No one likes to be criticized. I'd like to be able to sit every one down 
in my living room and explain my motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might call it greed, but I feel I'm the same person I've always been. I 
can't control how people feel and I'm not worried about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I received a standing ovation at the public workout, so not everyone 
thinks of it as greed. We're entertainers in the same sense that Frank Sinatra 
and Bruce Springsteen are, but the fact that they get $50,000 every time they 
sing a song doesn't get the exposure we do. And every time they negotiate a 
contract it isn't regarded as a sentimental attack on a team and city." 
</P>
<P>
Claire called Hershiser's signing historic and said his career is important in 
the context of Dodger history because it shows what a low draft choice can do 
through hard work and the pursuit of excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the record numbers, club owner Peter O'Malley said he doesn't know 
how long the trend could continue but added: "We're obviously pleased to have 
signed Orel or we wouldn't have offered the $7.9 million. He's the best pitcher 
in the game and we look for his consistency to continue." 
</P>
<P>
Did he contribute to the settlement? 
</P>
<P>
O'Malley said he was in New York Wednesday night and spoke with Claire on the 
phone from midnight to 2:30. 
</P>
<P>
"I contributed enough to help get him signed, but Fred and Bob Walker deserve 
the credit," O'Malley said after arriving at the team's training base in Vero 
Beach, Fla., Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda, also in Vero Beach, said he was happy to have the 
situation resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll treat Orel the same as when he was making $300 a month," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dodger broadcaster Don Drysdale: "I'm just glad I don't have to pay his 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser said he will work out at Dodger Stadium today, then fly to Vero Beach 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to be treated the same as he always has by his teammates. 
And why not? He has helped to take baseball's salary structure to new heights. 
</P>

Times staff writer Gordon Edes, in Vero Beach, Fla., contributed to this story.

WALTON SUIT GOES BEFORE ARBITRATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers' dispute with Bill Walton went before an arbitrator Thursday 
afternoon in New York and the leader of the players' union said a decision 
against Walton might be viewed as a threat to the union's agreement with the 
National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitrator Dan Collins, a professor at New York University Law School, received 
information from both Walton and the Clippers in a one-hour session. The 
dispute is about whether the 36-year-old former Clipper is entitled to receive 
about $1.6 million in deferred payments. 
</P>
<P>
Walton was represented by Larry Fleisher, former players' union chief, and 
Clipper attorney Bob Platt represented the team, which is contending in a suit 
that Walton violated his contract by being physically unfit to play and 
therefore forfeited his right to the deferred salary. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn., 
said he expects Collins to make a decision on the dispute soon, possibly as 
early as this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper President Alan Rothenberg said he expects Collins to rule in favor of 
Walton. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going to continue in the courts with our litigation, no matter 
what the arbitrator says," Rothenberg said. "We objected in the beginning that 
the (case) was outside his jurisdiction, but I don't know any arbitrator in the 
world who would disqualify himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll continue with the suit and seek damages because of what (Walton) did. 
There's no way an arbitrator can determine how we were damaged." 
</P>
<P>
That the matter between Walton and the Clippers belongs in arbitration and not 
the courts is considered vital to the union, Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sort of a cornerstone of the (collective bargaining) agreement," Grantham 
said. "Without a grievance-and-arbitration process, and having disputes 
resolved in a timely matter, the entire collective bargaining agreement as we 
see it, we don't have anything that's resolvable. It would be a threat to the 
way we do business." 
</P>
<P>
The Clipper suit contends that "certain activities" by Walton during the term 
of his five-year $5-million contract between 1979-1983 impaired his ability to 
play basketball. Gary Vandeweghe, Walton's attorney, said the Clippers are 
implying in the suit that Walton used drugs while a Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
Present at the arbitration hearing, in addition to Walton, Fleisher, Grantham 
and Platt, were Gary B. Bettman, NBA vice president and general counsel, and a 
lawyer representing the players union. 
</P>
<P>
It is Grantham's opinion that the arbitration procedure is the proper place for 
such a dispute to be settled. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in the courts," he said. "From our perspective, disputes between teams and 
players should go through the arbitration process. The question (the Clippers) 
are raising is, can their dispute be arbitrated? They think it should be 
resolved in the courts. We are saying, 'That dispute between you and Bill 
belongs in arbitration.' And what the Clippers are saying is that the 
arbitrator doesn't have the right to hear this case." 
</P>
<P>
Grantham refused to discuss the issues of the dispute, but said: "We think we 
have a good case." 
</P>
<P>
He also speculated that should Collins decide the case can be heard in 
arbitration and should he rule in Walton's favor, then another court, such as 
the one in which the Clipper suit may be heard, would not overturn the outcome 
of the arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
Bettman said the NBA has no right to decide whether binding arbitration or the 
courts is the proper form to decide the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, one will prevail," Bettman said. "It is a question of law 
that has to be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
However, Vandeweghe said it could become the league's responsibility to tell 
the Clippers to abide by the arbitrator's ruling and drop the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Telling them that they have to (accept the ruling), or ultimately taking their 
franchise from them," he said. "That's what's at risk here. If they defy the 
NBA and the players' association and the NBA thinks they're wrong, which I 
think they do, they'll take their franchise. They'll be out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"The Clippers would probably be delighted. They wouldn't have to play any more 
games. Then the Clippers are going to file a giant lawsuit against the league 
saying the league was wrong in doing it and the Clippers are going to lose. 
Meanwhile, their lawyers are going to make a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's look ahead to see what happens in the year 2007. If you choose to 
maintain for yourselves some tough-guy, macho image, you know, constantly 
putting up your dukes, the little boy constantly crying wolf. Pretty soon, Alan 
Rothenberg -- with all due respect to a guy I like very much -- standing there 
with his fists balled, filing lawsuits with his law firm's name all over it, it 
means nothing to anybody anymore. Who the hell do you think he's scaring. Now, 
they're a joke."

The Milwaukee Brewers and six other major league baseball teams will 
participate this year in a study to determine the health effects of smokeless 
tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers also were involved last year in the study, which is part of a 
three-year effort by researchers at UC San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Jacobs, the Brewers' physician, said baseball players make good guinea 
pigs because they are among the most prolific users of chewing tobacco and 
snuff.

The Southern Section ruled that the Oxnard Santa Clara High boys' basketball 
team will not be allowed to participate in regular-season tournaments next 
season and that the school's athletic department be put on probation until 
June, 1990, as a result of Santa Clara's pulling out of the Estancia tournament 
last Dec. 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara refused to return to the tournament for its final two games after 
Coach Lou Cvijanovich complained about the officiating in a 39-38 second-round 
loss to Huntington Beach Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara must also pay financial restitution to Estancia for losses in gate 
and concession receipts, and must reimburse travel expenses to Laguna Hills and 
Huntington Beach, the teams that were scheduled to play Santa Clara in the 
forfeited games.

The Cincinnati Reds, avoiding arbitration, signed outfielder Eric Davis and 
left-hander Tom Browning, but Pete Incaviglia lost his arbitration case against 
the Texas Rangers. Incaviglia will make $475,000, a raise of $200,000. He had 
asked for $828,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds got Davis to agree to a a one-year contract for $1.35 million, with 
the possibility of his earning $230,000 in bonuses, by sending owner Marge 
Schott to negotiate with him. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who made $899,000 in salary last year and $20,000 in bonuses, wanted 
$1.65 million in arbitration. The Reds offered $1.15 million. Negotiations 
became bitter and Davis asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, who last season pitched the only perfect game in Reds' history, 
agreed to a $1.025-million contract. He asked for $1.125 million in 
arbitration, and the Reds offered $810,000.

The Valley College basketball team, which forfeited a Western State Conference 
game against Glendale on Wednesday because only four of the team's seven 
players showed up on time, will forfeit its two remaining games. 
</P>
<P>
Valley athletic director George Goff said the decision not to complete the 
season was made after a review of academic records from the first semester, 
which revealed poor attendance and failing grades for several players who would 
have made them ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Valley was in contention for a spot in the Southern California regional 
playoffs, but the Monarchs conclude the season 17-15 overall and 7-8 in 
conference play.

USC held Sean Elliott to only 11 points, so Anthony Cook took over for 
second-ranked Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a 6-foot-9 senior from Van Nuys, scored a career-high 31 points as the 
Wildcats routed the Trojans, 93-70, in a Pacific 10 Conference game, sending 
USC to its 13th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew one of these years I would break the 30-point mark," Cook said. 
"Breaking 30, that's big. It's so hard to get there." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, 19-3 overall and 13-1 in the Pacific-10 Conference, holds a two-game 
lead over Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime we talked about spreading our offense around to get the ball to 
Cook, especially with Elliott having such a hard time," Arizona Coach Lute 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"In Sean's case, he was forcing some things. He made some judgment errors. 
Sometimes he needed to give it up, cut and move. I am sure he'll come out 
Saturday (against UCLA) ready to play. 
</P>
<P>
"They were double- and triple-teaming (Elliott), and the only way to beat that 
is to move the ball around." 
</P>
<P>
His strategy worked, as Cook, who scored 15 points in the first half, added 
another 10 in the first 7:54 of the second half as the Wildcats took command, 
58-40. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who had three dunks during the run, hit 12 of 14 shots and also had 12 
rebounds. He could have had more but was only 7 for 12 on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a horrible job of defending Cook, but we probably helped him a lot in 
the (NBA) draft," USC Coach George Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said the Trojans (7-17, 0-12) wanted to make Elliott work for his 
shots and wear him down. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we did a decent job on him, but it was academic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats led by 22 points with 9:05 left, and the closest USC came the rest 
of the way was 75-60 with 5:23 left on two foul shots by Chris Moore, who 
scored 21 points. Ronnie Coleman added 19 for the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Lofton had 10 points for Arizona.

An ailing UC Irvine basketball team limped into Thursday night's game against 
University of the Pacific hoping to find the panacea for all Big West 
Conference teams: Take a win from the Tigers and go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters were playing without Jeff Herdman -- the nation's leading 
three-point shooter who has the flu -- and also had their top rebounder and No. 
2 scorer, center Mike Doktorczyk, limping with a severe thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, 10-12 overall and 7-6 in the Big West, scored a 95-92 overtime victory 
over Pacific (5-17, 1-12) at the Spanos Center. It was the Tigers' third 
consecutive overtime loss at home. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters managed to finally pull away from the tenacious Tigers and led by 
10 (75-65) with 5:33 left in regulation. But Pacific outscored Irvine, 16-2, to 
take a 81-77 lead with 1:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
Doktorczyk, who scored 26 points, hit a three-pointer with 1:13 left to cut the 
Pacific lead to one. After an Irvine turnover -- when guard Kevin Floyd slipped 
to the floor -- Pacific's Reggie Ricks hit a pair of free throws to give the 
Tigers an 83-80 advantage with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who scored 25, then hit a three-pointer with eight seconds left to send 
the game into overtime.

Michael Jordan scored 50 points, including a 20-foot jumper with one second 
remaining, as the Chicago Bulls defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, 117-116, Thursday 
night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, scoring 50 points for the 17th time in his career to tie Elgin Baylor 
for second place behind Wilt Chamberlain's 118 50-point games, had 27 in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
His winning shot came after Milwaukee's Terry Cummings could not control a pass 
and lost the ball out of bounds with six seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 93, Miami 80 -- James Donaldson scored 16 points and had a career-high 
22 rebounds as the Mavericks beat the Heat at Dallas in their first game since 
the trade of Mark Aguirre. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday for Adrian Dantley. 
Dantley is scheduled to report to Dallas today. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 129, Boston 114 -- At Salt Lake City, Karl Malone scored 36 points, 23 in 
the second half, as the Jazz defeated the Celtics for the first time in five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
John Stockton added 22 points and 16 assists for Utah, and Thurl Bailey scored 
21 off the bench. 
</P>

Detroit 95, Sacramento 84 -- Joe Dumars, Vinnie Johnson and Bill Laimbeer each 
scored 20 points at Sacramento to help the Pistons extend their winning streak 
to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Rodman led Detroit with 15 rebounds, and Isiah Thomas had 14 assists.

CONNER, LYE, PEOPLES TOP FIELD WITH 65S;

<P>
AMONG THEM, THE LEADERS IN SAN DIEGO OPEN HAVE ONLY ONE VICTORY

Leader No. 1 is the answer to a trivia question. Leader No. 2 draws stares 
every time he pulls his putter out of his bag. Leader No. 3 sank everything but 
the Merrimac Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, Frank Conner, Mark Lye and David Peoples made 23 birdies and shared 
first place at 65, seven under par, after one round of the Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Open at Torrey Pines North and South. 
</P>
<P>
But among them, Conner, Lye and Peoples have won one PGA event in their 
combined 30 years on tour. 
</P>
<P>
That is why former PGA champion Bob Tway's 66 on the tougher South course 
looked better and better as this sunny but cool afternoon wore on. David Frost, 
Gil Morgan and Scott Verplank, also name players in a relatively nameless 
field, fired 67s along with Rick Fehr and Brad Faxon. 
</P>
<P>
And favorites Mark O'Meara, Fred Couples, Joey Sindelar and Mark Calcavecchia 
finished with 68, 68, 70 and 72, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
There were 66s turned in by Canadian Dave Barr and Californian Dennis Trixler. 
There was a 67 by San Diego left-hander Ernie Gonzalez. And there were 18 
players besides O'Meara and Couples at 68. Former U.S. Open champions Jerry 
Pate and Johnny Miller were among 16 players at 69, one better than a large 
group at 70 that included two-time San Diego winner Tom Watson. 
</P>
<P>
But Conner, Lye and Peoples were kings for at least this one day. 
</P>
<P>
The pudgy Conner grew up in Belleville, Ill., where he was a nationally ranked 
tennis player and practice partner for neighbor Jimmy Connors. He later became 
a three-time tennis All-American at Trinity University in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
He switched to golf in his early 20s. Trivia buffs will note that Conner and 
Ellsworth Vines are the only men ever to play in the U.S. Open tennis 
tournament and the U.S. Open golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Before Thursday, Conner had played in two golf tournaments this year without 
surviving a cut. His caddie here sells used tires for a living. Other pertinent 
biographical information includes a 1982 victory in the King Hassan Open in 
Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of putts dropped for Conner Thursday on the shorter North course, eight of 
them for birdies and seven of them in a nine-hole stretch. None of them was 
longer than 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Not so trivial is the 42-inch putter wielded by the gangly Lye, who spent his 
off-season lifting weights 2 1/2 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The weight training has added length off the tee -- he hit the North course's 
488-yard par-5 with a drive and a six-iron -- and the extra-long putter has 
added confidence on the greens. Still, people stare. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to deal with everyone looking at you funny," Lye says. "I've heard 
the snickering." 
</P>
<P>
But nobody laughed when he holed a 60-foot putt that went uphill then downhill 
before it dropped into the hole for a birdie on the 435-yard No. 8. It followed 
his only bogey and helped him retain his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Lye said the shorter North course plays about "two shots" easier than the South 
course. Which means Peoples' 65 on the South was the best round of the day. The 
field will switch courses today. The final two rounds will be played 
exclusively on the South course. 
</P>
<P>
Peoples' bogey-free round included birdie putts of 55, 40, 30, 20, and 15 feet. 
He missed a four-footer for birdie on No. 18 that would have given him the 
outright lead and a $50,000 zero coupon Treasury certificate, the tournament 
sponsor's has promised each day's low round shooter. Because of the ties, the 
coupon will carry over to today's round where the low shooter can win $100,000 
in coupons if nobody ties him. 
</P>
<P>
Peoples credited his host for the week, Rancho Santa Fe amateur Ed Whittemore, 
for an impromptu putting lesson on the eve of the tournament. Peoples and 
Whittemore hadn't met before this week. In essence, Whittemore told Peoples to 
stick with the original read on his putts once he stood over the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Tway's round was an 18-foot eagle putt on the 537-yard sixth 
hole that he reached with a driver and a three-wood. After winning this 
tournament in 1986, Tway went on to win three more times that year including 
the PGA where he blasted in from a bunker on the 72nd hole to snatch the 
championship away from a stunned Greg Norman. 
</P>
<P>
But Tway hasn't won since, going from second on the money list that year to 
47th to 29th in 1988. "After a couple of years of not winning, you really start 
to feel like doing it again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tom Watson's two-under par 70 on the North course was five shots behind the 
leaders. But he's not sweating for a check. Watson has won $4,978,584 on the 
Tour and will go over the $5 million mark in career earnings if he finishes 
eighth or better this week. Only Jack Nicklaus ($5,008,753) has won more 
official money than Watson. Nicklaus is not playing here. If Watson finishes 
fourth or better, he will vault past Nicklaus and into first place on the 
all-time money list. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the top 20 all-time money winners are in this tournament. They are 
Watson (second), John Mahaffey (11th), Craig Stadler (14th), Johnny Miller 
(15th) and Gil Morgan (18th). . . . Left-hander Ernie Gonzalez, will turn 28 
Sunday. His victory in the rain-shortened 1986 Pensacola Open was the last by a 
left-hander on tour. Before that, the last victory by a left-hander was by New 
Zealand's Bob Charles at Greensboro, N.C., in 1974. . . . Mac O'Grady shot 38 
on the front side of the North and withdrew. Tournament officials said the 
reason was a bad back. . . . David Peoples' 30 on the front side of the South 
course was one shot off the seven-under par nine-hole record of 29 shot by 
David Frost in 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Altos, the No. 3-seeded team in the Southern Section Girls 4-A Division, 
defeated Coachella Valley Thursday night, 64-56, in a first-round playoff game 
at Los Altos High. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Peters, a 5-foot-11 senior forward who has signed a national letter of 
intent with USC in volleyball, led the Conquerors (25-1) with 25 points, 12 
rebounds and 10 assists. Peters is averaging 22 points and 12 rebounds overall. 
</P>
<P>
Jenny Valenzuela, averaging 22 points a game for Coachella Valley (12-8), was 
held to 13 points. In other first-round playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
Montclair 53, El Monte 51 -- Montclair's Nika Dunn sank one of two free throws 
with four seconds left to break a 51-51 tie in the 5-A Division game at El 
Monte. El Monte (16-9) then turned the ball over when one of its players 
stepped out of bounds. Lorena Gonzalez, a Montclair junior varsity player who 
was brought up for the playoffs, was intentionally fouled with one second 
remaining. She made one of two free throws. Montclair is 13-11. 
</P>
<P>
Downey 64, San Clemente 49 -- Downey (18-7), an at-Large entry from the San 
Gabriel Valley League, outscored San Clemente (18-7) to win their 4-AA division 
game at Downey High. After a competitive first half which ended, 31-29, Downey 
pulled ahead to a 45-39 lead at the end of the third quarter. Heidi Crammer, 
who led Downey with 20 points, scored six of her points in the fourth quarter

OKLAHOMA PRESS CALLS FOR SWITZER'S RESIGNATION

<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Oklahoma student newspaper and the state's three largest 
publications are all saying it's time for football Coach Barry Switzer to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Oklahoman reiterated what it said in 1982, that Switzer should quit. 
The Oklahoma City newspaper cited the recent arrests of five football players 
on various felony charges, including rape and drug dealing, in its editorial. 
</P>
<P>
"Other newspapers have recently called for Switzer's ouster. We didn't bother 
this time," the Oklahoman said. "We called for that more than six years ago 
before the football program's troubles turned to probation, shooting, alleged 
rape and suspected drug dealing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Switzer has never set the best of examples in his personal life." 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma Daily, the university's student newspaper, directed an editorial 
at Switzer: "Now that you've let any kind of positive attraction to your 
program become a fading dream, you are helping no one. Take responsibility for 
your department or resign." 
</P>
<P>
The Tulsa World, the state's second-largest newspaper, called for both Switzer 
and Athletic Director Donnie Duncan to resign. And the Tulsa Tribune earlier 
called for Switzer's resignation.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714) 
859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic 
dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an 
almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no 
utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a 
sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory 
vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music 
accompanying her is deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m. 
to 10:30 p.m., weekends till 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a 
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the 
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic centered beef) are 
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50 
noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the 
new wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and 
jackfruit. 
</P>
<P>
Caffe Piemonte, 1835 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 532-3296. Open Tuesdays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Tuesdays through Sundays 5 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers from Piemonte, one of Italy's most scenic provinces, have opened 
this handsome, spotless little trattoria in the city of Orange, and already it 
has become a county hotspot. Start any meal here with the wonderful, sumptuous 
antipasto and then move on to one of chef Luigi Ravetto's hand extruded 
homemade pastas (such as chewy ruotelle, little, six-spoked wheels perfect for 
soaking up sauce). Ravetto's cooking is somewhat generic, but he has included 
polenta, the cornmeal staple of his province, and you really should try it. His 
polenta Piemontese, with a light, grainy cheese sauce, is most appealing. 
</P>
<P>
California Pizza Kitchen, Fashion Island, 1151 Newport Center Drive, Newport 
Beach. (714) 759-5543. Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., 
Fridays and Saturdays to 11, Sundays to 9. 
</P>
<P>
 With the '80s has come the designer pizza, and it looks as if the phenom is 
here to stay. That's what the California Pizza Kitchen is banking on, anyway. 
This slicked down operation, designed for flash and staffed with young, 
beautiful people, serves an eclectic, almost futuristic array of pizzas topped 
with everything from goat cheese to peanut sauce. Service is somewhat 
indifferent at present; high energy owners Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld should 
fix that problem soon. Best to stick with the pizzas that don't fall too far 
from the tree; five-cheese, homemade sausage, and a delicious barbecued 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
1520 AD, 821 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim. (714) 995-5464. Seatings are Fridays at 
7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The food at 1520 AD may not be authentic Tudor, but who cares? When you eat 
with your fingers, everything tastes better. The opening course at this 
re-creation of a Merrie Olde England roadhouse is a hearty lentil barley soup, 
drunk from large draughts and eaten with hunks of brown bread. There is a 
choice of four entrees: slow-cooked chicken, lamb shank in a white sauce, steak 
kabob, and a most modern filet of halibut with a heathen Spanish sauce on top. 
The abundant platters of rice and vegetables, the fine, lemony pound cake, and 
the bottomless mugs of ice cold beer make for a dinner that King Henry himself 
would have enjoyed.

NEW AMERICAN CUISINE COMES TO ORANGE COUNTY AT AN AFFORDABLE, POPULIST PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Max Jacobson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new American cuisine is somewhat of a sacred cow with self-styled foodies, 
who gobble it up at such restaurants as Spago in West Hollywood, Trees in 
Corona del Mar or Pasadena's Parkway Grill. But it is not so sacred to the 
owner of the last establishment, restaurateur Greg Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Smith did what many proponents of American cuisine have only 
talked about: He made a populist movement out of it, opening a small, laughably 
inexpensive cafe version of his restaurant on Pasadena's busy Lake Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He named his restaurant Crocodile Cafe, after the yuppie symbol found on the 
Lacoste shirt, and even he could not have predicted the overwhelming response. 
People crowded at the door at all hours, even 3 in the afternoon, to enjoy his 
wood-fired designer pizzas, homemade pastas and meats grilled over smoking 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
Now the inevitable has happened. Smith has expanded the business. Crocodile 
Cafe in the Brea Marketplace has the same menu and the same good food that made 
the Pasadena restaurant take off like a Roman candle. Now the big question is, 
will it play in Orange County? So far the answer appears to be yes. 
</P>
<P>
Cold weather has kept the patio empty, but when a friend and I walk into the 
cafe for our first meal there, a smiling hostess rushes to open the door for 
us. Looking up, we see a giant, green vinyl crocodile hanging from a 
multicolored parachute almost 20 feet up. Shades of Frank Gehry? 
</P>
<P>
We sit on high-tech, black-vinyl chairs at a mock granite table and notice how 
young the crowd is. Nearly everyone seems to be eating pizza and stealing 
glances at the outrageous mural, a 30-foot seascape of a crocodile (what else) 
water skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Our senses are immediately aroused by the scents coming from the Spago-style 
open kitchen, and as we open the menu, it looks suspiciously familiar. We begin 
with a half Caesar salad, and a fabulously succulent Anaheim chile stuffed with 
smoked Jack cheese in a tomatillo salsa. The salsa is a pale green, like the 
crocodile. 
</P>
<P>
My friend is not eating meat that evening, so he progresses to a vegetable 
pizza, a complex affair with eggplant, green pepper, red onion, tomato, 
caramelized garlic and fresh herbs. It looks as if Jackson Pollock has taken up 
cooking, and it's one of the best pizzas we have ever tasted. I try the 
marinated flank steak with cumin-spiked fresh vegetables, and find it as 
delightfully oaky as a blue-ribbon Chardonnay. I finish it in world-record 
time. 
</P>
<P>
On a second visit I am joined by my wife, and a different smiling face springs 
to the door to open it. (The first time we thought it was an accident.) We 
begin with a misnamed, but entirely reasonable tortilla soup -- a gazpacho 
textured vegetable puree with strips of tortilla on top. The waitress brings 
two spoons without being asked. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife tells the waitress she is in the mood for spicy pasta, the 
waitress recommends fettuccine with grilled chicken, roasted Pasilla chile, 
fresh corn, cilantro, and ancho-chile cream. We both agree it sounds like a bit 
much, but when it arrives, we fight over it, and I catch my wife hoarding the 
little bits of fresh corn stuck to the bottom of the dish. And I thought 
marriage is supposed to be based on trust. 
</P>
<P>
My dish is not as good -- an oak-grilled Coho salmon special on a bed of 
raspberry-vinegared greens that have gotten a bit limp under the fish. And I do 
not care for the potato pancakes I order on the side. They bear little 
resemblance to the crisp, deli-style sort I'm used to. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, we return for Sunday brunch. My wife has amazingly good fusilli 
pasta with homemade sausage, tomatoes, and fresh herbs to start, while I munch 
on a barbecued chicken pizza that is covered with plenty of sweet, pungent 
sauce. Then she has a blue-corn tostada salad with black beans, served in a 
bowl so enormous she can only manage about one fifth of it. I can eat only half 
of my wonderful roast beef sandwich grilled with tomatoes, Jack cheese, arugula 
and spiced mayonnaise. The waitress brings plastic boxes for the leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
If the Crocodile Cafe misses the mark occasionally, it is probably in the 
dessert section. Beignets, written up on the wordy menu as "a deep south 
doughnut delight! Rolled in Maple sugar and served with a chocolate sauce for 
dipping," come with brown sugar instead and are too well done. When I ask the 
waitress where the maple sugar is, she replies "this is our maple sugar." 
</P>
<P>
A densely rich, devilishly dark slice of chocolate cake looks great, but tastes 
curiously stale. Far better are soft, chewy brownies and fresh berries with 
cinnamon-vanilla whipped cream. Those I am happy to eat as often as my doctor 
will permit me. 
</P>
<P>
Smith is a devoted wine buff, so you can bet your Beamer that the wines he has 
chosen are of good repute. Chardonnays including William Hill and Stratford, 
and Cabernet Sauvignons including Fitch Mountain and Clos du Bois are all 
available by the glass at precisely one-fourth of the reasonable bottle prices. 
What else would you expect from a populist. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Cafe is inexpensive to moderate, and without equal in its price 
category. Soups and small plates are $1.95 to $5.80; salads are $2.95 to $6.75; 
sandwiches are $5.25 and $5.95; pasta, pizza and calzone are $5.95 to $7.25; 
large plates are $7.95 to $8.75.

CSUN PLAYOFF HOPES DIM AFTER 71-67 LOSS TO CCAA FOE CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is still a pulse, albeit a faint one. 
</P>
<P>
Using a couple of baseball terms, let's put it this way: There are two out in 
the ninth inning and two strikes on the Cal State Northridge basketball team. 
It needs a grand slam to win. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker is that there's nobody on -- figuratively and literally. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge likely will need victories in its last three California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. games if it hopes to reach the playoffs. And considering 
conference co-leaders Cal State Dominguez Hills and UC Riverside, are among 
those remaining on the schedule, it doesn't look good for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College pushed Northridge a little closer to oblivion by defeating the 
Matadors, 71-67, Thursday night at the Hutton Sports Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman and CSUN were tied for fourth with Cal Poly San Luis Obispo coming into 
the game; only four teams make the CCAA's postseason playoff tournament. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo also lost, 85-66, to UC Riverside on Thursday, leaving Chapman 
alone in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Even if CSUN pulls back into a tie with the Panthers by season's end, Chapman 
is the team that will qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The first tiebreaker in the league playoff format is head-to-head competition. 
Chapman is 2-0 against CSUN, having defeated the Matadors, 79-74, three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, one of only two teams in the CCAA shooting better than 50% as a team, 
was even better than that against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers shot 56% as five players reached double figures in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we needed a total team effort tonight," said Russ Ortega, who scored a 
game-high 17 points. "This was a crucial win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Coach Pete Cassidy was quick to point out that Northridge -- 14-10 
overall, 5-6 in the CCAA -- qualified for the tournament with a 7-7 record last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Down by seven with two minutes left, Northridge scored four consecutive times 
down the floor, cutting the Panthers' lead to 69-67 when Darren Matsubara made 
two free throws with one minute left. But in that last minute, CSUN fell victim 
to -- of all things -- its own hustle. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 seconds left -- and only a tick or two on the 45-second shot clock -- 
Northridge forced a jump ball. Unfortunately for the Matadors, the possession 
marker favored Chapman. The 45-second clock then was reset -- actually turned 
off -- and the Panthers had no need to attempt another shot. 
</P>
<P>
Forced to foul, CSUN's Karl Becker hacked Mike Minier, who made both ends of a 
one-and-one situation with 16 seconds remaining to give Chapman a more 
comfortable four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Matsubara led Northridge with 13 points and Alan Fraser added 12. Derrick 
Gathers added 10 points and Kendell McDaniels had nine points and 10 rebounds.

BIG MAN ON CAMPUS;

<P>
AT OAKWOOD SCHOOL, A REMARKABLE UNION OF ATHLETIC PROWESS AND ACADEMIC ACUITY 
MAKES MITCHELL BUTLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There isn't much critical ammunition with which to blast Mitchell Butler. By 
nearly universal account, the Oakwood School student has impeccable credentials 
in both athletic and academic arenas and is of sterling character and resolve, 
a women-and-children-first kind of guy. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, some people are never satisfied. Take, for instance, a pair of 
Butler's schoolmates who often teased the high school All-American about not 
trying a particular all-world dunk in a real game. Sure, Butler had thrown down 
an assortment of rim-rattlers in the past, but his friends insisted on 
something revolutionary, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning of the year, they've been after me to do a 360," 
Butler said. "But every time I had a chance to dunk, there was a defender near 
me. And that makes a maneuver of that sort fairly difficult." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding, especially for those among us whose dunks are limited to the 
doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Butler finally found the opportunity he was looking for. In a game 
against Liberty League foe Windward, Butler swiped the ball and was at 
halfcourt before anyone realized what had happened. The turnaround move that 
followed turned a few heads, hardly a new occurrence in Butler's four-year 
varsity career. 
</P>
<P>
"Their point guard made an errant pass and I stepped in and stole it," said 
Butler, a 6-foot-5 1/2, 200-pound senior. "It took them some time to react, so 
I had a good lead. I was all alone, so I jumped up, did a little 360, and put 
it through." 
</P>
<P>
At Oakwood, it sometimes seems as though the world revolves around Butler, one 
of the school's most personable students and someone who, administrators 
readily admit, has helped give the school an athletic identity where none 
previously existed. 
</P>
<P>
When the Inglewood native enrolled at Oakwood -- a private, K-12 school of 560 
students in North Hollywood -- his life, in a manner of speaking, also had 
turned full circle. The basketball fortunes of Oakwood, currently the defending 
Southern Section Small Schools Division champion, soon followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Butler was floored. In the old days, this would have been A-plus work, 
a top-flight paper. But this wasn't Inglewood and he wasn't on hardwood. This 
was Oakwood, where academia isn't an afterthought, it's a focal point. Gray 
matter is all that really matters here. 
</P>
<P>
Butler had been asked to do a psychoanalytic interpretation of a fable, the 
"Three Little Pigs." By Oakwood's barometer, however, the effort was the 
academic equivalent of an air ball from 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The paper that Mitchell wrote was unlike most of his papers -- and actually 
was a rather poor one -- and I was quick to tell him it wasn't up to his usual 
standards," said Oakwood Headmaster Jim Astman, who also teaches a psychology 
class. 
</P>
<P>
After an hourlong meeting with Astman, Butler went to work on a revised 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
"A week and a half later, unsolicited, he turns in a brand new analysis where 
he had taken every piece of what we'd discussed and incorporated it into what 
was now a marvelous paper," Astman said. 
</P>
<P>
For Butler, who last November accepted an athletic scholarship to attend UCLA, 
his adventures at Oakwood always have seemed destined for a fairy-tale ending. 
</P>
<P>
In November, he was named "Best in the West" in a Southland newspaper's annual 
preseason survey of college coaches and scouts, better than anyone at any 
position, at any high school level. National publications generally have 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
In a mid-season edition, Kentucky-based Hoop Scoop magazine ranked Butler the 
29th-best player in the nation, ahead of standouts such as Tracy Murray of 
Glendora (45th), Dedan Thomas of Taft (52nd), Adonis Jordan of Cleveland (58th) 
and Ed Stokes of St. Bernard (73rd). 
</P>
<P>
Yet the only numerical values Butler was interested in when he transferred to 
Oakwood were the ones on his slide rule. 
</P>
<P>
Like most students at Oakwood, Butler is more than capable of handling himself 
in the classroom. He is currently taking classes in anatomy, pre-calculus, 
physiology, art, psychology and Latin. Oakwood is generally portrayed as a 
school for eggheads, and Butler does not subordinate academics to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Et tu, Butler? 
</P>
<P>
 You bet. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Butler and Astman met to discuss some recent reading assignments. 
(Warning: For those who think Freud is the surname of the Houston Rocket guard 
nicknamed "Sleepy," skip the next few paragraphs.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at the moral dimensions of psychoanalysis," Astman said, 
slipping into a professorial tone. "He just finished the 'Sexual Enlightenment 
of Children' by Freud. He now has a new article by a woman at Harvard who has 
raised serious questions about Freud's choice of the Oedipus myth to discuss 
sexual conflict in children. She proposes a different method using psyche and 
Eros . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I get as much out of these sessions as he does." 
</P>
<P>
Heady stuff, yet Butler says his long-term academic goal is to become a sports 
psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I like Freud," Butler says, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
He also likes the strict academic regimen. Butler's grade-point average is 3.0. 
Out of pride, he plans to retake the Scholastic Aptitude Test because he only 
scored 1,000 -- he is confident he can top 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been an A student at Morningside High School, no doubt about it," 
said Butler, who started attending Oakwood in the sixth grade after having 
never received less than an A grade in any public-school course. "But I think 
at UCLA I'll have a pretty simple time with classes and adapting to the time 
constraints. Guys from a public-school background might be in for a little more 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Butler left Inglewood and the public-school system through a series of fateful 
and often humorous events. As strange at it seems, an Andy Hardy-type movie 
eventually led, albeit somewhat indirectly, to his transfer to Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
As a fourth-grader, Butler found himself watching a movie on television that 
featured children in some sort of camp environment. After pestering from 
Mitchell, his mother Linda agreed to check into local camps. He did not specify 
what variety. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I started in on my mom with it right away," he said. "I wanted to 
get away and experience a little bit of life away from home." 
</P>
<P>
Eight years later, he still is enjoying the experience, although Oakwood is 
rarely confused with Boys Town. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Butler contacted a friend who knew former Laker Happy Hairston, who 
operated a basketball camp at a Southland high school. Butler enrolled at the 
camp and soon thereafter formed a friendship with Hairston. 
</P>
<P>
Hairston, who had established a foundation that helps steer underprivileged or 
inner-city youths to private schools, was impressed by Butler's academic acuity 
and scheduled an interview for Butler with Oakwood administrators. A year 
later, Butler was placed on academic scholarship -- the school absorbed its 
considerable tuition, now $8,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 12% of the overall student body of 560 students in grades K-12 
comprises minorities. Butler says that he is uncomfortable with the stereotype 
people have of students from the inner city. His father Arthur is a chef at 
Centinella Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood and his mother manages the 
apartment complex in which the family lives. They are far from wealthy and the 
surrounding area is inhabited by some frightening characters, he said, but his 
parents have instilled a system of values that remain with him today. 
</P>
<P>
His oldest brother, McArthur, six years his senior, was a linebacker at Nevada 
Las Vegas. Michael, who is five years older than Mitchell, will graduate from 
Grambling in May. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of kids' parents in the area don't care about academics," Butler said. 
"Our parents have always been strict with us and made sure that we get the best 
out of what's given to us. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a special opportunity, a special gift that's been given to me on a 
silver platter, and I have to capitalize on it. I'm always willing to put in 
the extra effort, to put in a little bit more, never be satisfied with what I 
have. They taught me that." 
</P>
<P>
Butler does not downplay the added sense of perspective that the transfer 
helped bring about, however. To a degree, it has allowed him to see opposite 
ends of the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a chance to experience both worlds, and I think it's good in the 
sense that I can look at both sides," he said, "and I can see what it is I that 
I would or wouldn't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Butler's levelheadedness and temperament have won over many people, teachers 
and coaches included. 
</P>
<P>
"He has maturity beyond his years," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "He's 
tremendously unselfish. He really wants his teammates to share in his success. 
He could shoot every time up the court, and his teammates would never say a 
word, but he doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates not only have enjoyed the benefits of Butler's success, but 
shared it. 
</P>
<P>
"He never looks to who it is that he's passing the ball to," said Jon Mark, a 
senior forward. "He wants the worst person, the rookies, to score, too. He's 
always right there cheering the loudest for everybody to get a chance." 
</P>
<P>
His teachers say that they are careful not to push too hard because Butler is 
so receptive to new ideas and so often exceeds their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any sort of onus that he has to live with, it's that he is this 
perfect kid," Astman said. "I have to continually remind myself that this is 
also an adolescent and that expectations are too great in terms of his 
character. I'm sure he likes to get out with his friends and goof off, too." 
</P>
<P>
For some, Butler would be a guy most students would love to hate. Every school 
seems to have someone like him, the darling quarterback who dates the 
best-looking cheerleader and gets the best grades. But Butler's humility and 
sense of humor, his teachers say, have short-circuited any resentment. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a kid that has it all together," Oakwood Principal Fred Mednick said. 
"He's handsome, he's smart, he is a great athlete, and he's not at all 
exploited it. He likes to laugh at it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Butler's successes on the court have sent an electric jolt through a campus 
that heretofore had thought of athletics as nothing but an amusing sidelight. 
Before Butler, the school had never won a Southern Section title of any kind 
and had never sent anyone to a Division I school on an athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
The school's rather bohemian school paper, the Gorilla, devotes as much or more 
space to toy drives, deforestation, earthquakes and media reviews -- replete 
with a caption reading "Thank God" under a picture of a bloodied Geraldo Rivera 
-- as it does to sports. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Butler's recent signing with UCLA ran on page 11 of the 12-page 
publication. A picture accompanying the story shows Butler standing underneath 
the school's lone basketball hoop next to a pair of grinning seventh-graders, 
who, unlike some of their peers who take him for granted, seem very impressed, 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
It long has been the bane of Butler that people perceive his competition as 
less than competitive. But Oakwood, which has played in the Small Schools 
championship game each of the past two seasons and made the playoffs in 
Butler's freshman year, was moved to the 1-A Division this season. 
</P>
<P>
While he plays against many players who are half his size and fall far short of 
his athletic abilities, he often is triple-teamed because he is Oakwood's only 
established offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to offset the lack of competitiveness at the 1-A level, Butler has played 
in a variety of other leagues. As a sophomore, his team won the West Coast 
title in the 15-and-under division of the American Roundball Corp. His 
teammates included Nick Sanderson of Bell-Jeff, UCLA-bound football player 
Brian Allen of Hart and future Bruin teammate Darrick Martin. Butler has played 
in ARC competition ever since. 
</P>
<P>
He also plays in pick-up games to hone his game, sometimes against the likes of 
NBA star Kiki Vandeweghe and high school or college stars from the Los Angeles 
area such as future UCLA teammates Martin, Trevor Wilson and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's dominance of the Small Schools Division, however, has been a boon to 
school spirit, if not his personal athletic progress. Butler has brought out a 
fanatical following where apathy once reigned. Now, it's cool to be true to 
your school. 
</P>
<P>
At Oakwood, where a handful of spectators was once the norm, Butler has them 
turning out in droves -- 10 times the previous rate at the gate. And interest 
has spread to other athletic teams. 
</P>
<P>
"He has created such excitement and enthusiasm for sports in general that it's 
incredible," said Astman, who knows a superlative when he utters one. "The 
attendance at the games is exciting, unbelievable. We have better attendance 
across the board and more interest in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Mitchell, we were lucky if we had 25 people. Now, it's unusual if we 
have less than a couple of hundred." 
</P>
<P>
His influence has been startling. Oakwood was 10-11 the season before Butler 
joined the varsity, and the Gorillas now have appeared in the playoffs in four 
consecutive seasons. Oakwood, which is 17-5 after an 88-50 first-round playoff 
win over Dunn on Wednesday night, plays at Mammoth at 7:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the Butler Effect has been desired. At Oakwood, brains and brawn 
don't always mix. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitchell has, in fact, given us a variety of experiences we wouldn't have 
otherwise had," Astman said. "We have been exposed to recruiting practices of 
colleges, journalists, to a variety of agencies and people we would have never 
had exposure to otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor were we comfortable with all of it. We got pens, letters and all kinds of 
stuff sent here from recruiters. . . . No one asked me a single question about 
his academics. . . . Whenever we saw a car pull up and a man in a suit got out, 
we automatically assumed it was a college coach." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the publicity and exposure have been overwhelmingly positive, Astman 
said. And for a school whose lone basketball hoop is located outdoors in the 
middle of a parking lot, the terms of the trade-off have been more than 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood's secondary school, which includes grades 7-12, is located within sight 
of North Hollywood High on Magnolia Boulevard, little more than a three-point 
shot from the southbound lane of the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Mednick's office overlooks a tiny courtyard that bustles with student activity. 
On the window of Mednick's office door is, appropriately, a small picture of 
Albert Einstein. For at Oakwood, everything Butler does is subject to a Theory 
of Relativity. 
</P>
<P>
Even after he signed with UCLA, Butler found himself wrestling with the nagging 
question of how well he might have fared at a large high school, in an 
established program, against players of his own caliber. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, the Southern Section Small Schools Player of the Year after his 
sophomore and junior seasons, averaged 22 points on the varsity as a 6-foot-2 
freshman and currently leads Valley-area players in scoring (28.5 a game) and 
rebounding (16.0), as he did last season when he was selected The Times' Valley 
Player of the Year. But he has has heard the whispers. 
</P>
<P>
He says, however, that he never seriously considered transferring for the sake 
of playing at a school with an established athletic program. Yet, had Butler 
been slightly bigger as a youth . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Coming into the school, everything was for academic reasons," he said. "I had 
no idea that I would blossom into what I am as a player. But in going back to 
that time, if I had known that I was going to turn out this way, I probably 
wouldn't have attended Oakwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have been just as naive as the next player and stayed in the 
public-school system. I really had no clue about what lay ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
Astman said that once Butler showed signs of being a superior athlete, he 
approached Butler's parents about the possibility of a transfer, fearing that 
the school would inhibit Butler's growth as a player. 
</P>
<P>
"I confess, I sometimes worried about whether this sort of place would be 
giving him the kind of push that somebody with his talent deserved," Astman 
said. "I did speak with the family about it, and they've all along been very 
clear-headed, saying that there were many avenues through which Mitchell could 
get the sort of experience against the level of competition that he needed." 
</P>
<P>
Said his father, Arthur: "He's a blessed child and a gifted child. We really 
stress to him that he uses his gifts and balance out the books and sports. 
</P>
<P>
"The city moves fast, and sometimes kids can get involved in things they don't 
know how to get out of. We felt this was the best way." 
</P>
<P>
Harrick recalls hearing of Butler a few seasons ago, and wondering what the 
commotion was all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember reading all about him, about this kid who played at this small 
school," said Harrick, who then coached at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after moving to UCLA, Harrick and dozens of other Division I 
coaches last summer saw Butler at the prestigious, invitation-only Nike Camp in 
Princeton, N. J. For Harrick, it was the first time he had seen Butler play, 
and it was an enlightening experience. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that he was as good an athlete as there was back there," 
said Harrick, who was not the only coach impressed. Said Arizona Coach Lute 
Olson: "All year long, people have been saying that Mitch Butler is one of the 
best players in the country. And his performance at Nike only verified what 
people have thought for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Butler's presence at Oakwood ultimately has not cost him athletically, 
at least in the short term. Harrick, in fact, believes that it may have helped 
him in certain respects because Butler has the freedom to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's helped his offense tremendously," Harrick said. "He has all kinds of 
moves, and it's only helped him refine what he wants to do." 
</P>
<P>
There have been a few reservations, however, as there are for any player about 
to join the college ranks. Harrick says that Butler must improve his 
ballhandling and shooting range, and to be sure, playing at an Oakwood has 
drawbacks. At Oakwood, a throng means drawing 200. At some college venues, it's 
closer to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"You put a kid from Oakwood in Pauley against Louisville, and it might be a 
different story," Harrick said. "You take a kid and throw him out there in 
(Louisville's) Freedom Hall, and who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet Harrick said that Butler probably would have played if he was now at UCLA, 
which is thin at the guard position because of an injury to Gerald Madkins. 
Butler, who plays just about every position at Oakwood, is expected to play at 
off-guard in college. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our No. 1 recruit at (the off-guard) position, no question," Harrick 
said. "He might very well have been able to help us this year, sure." 
</P>
<P>
Butler insists that all along he felt that the level of play at Oakwood was not 
a major consideration. The trade-offs were always worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"I never said, 'Geez, I need to go to a bigger school to get more notoriety,' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't hurt, not at all. When I think about it, it's like, 'I'm ranked in 
the top 25 in the country and people say I don't get enough out of it? Where 
would I be at a big school? What would my position be now?' I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, begrudgingly, admits that he is a big fish in a small sea at Oakwood. 
He said that he is acutely aware that some of the school's younger students 
look up to him -- literally and figuratively -- and view him as a role model. 
And at Oakwood, where it sometimes seems there is a Porsche in every student's 
garage, the irony of this has not escaped him. 
</P>
<P>
"There are guys everywhere who don't have the proper system of values, who fall 
askew," Butler said. "I'd like to go on and be myself but still be someone 
other kids can emulate and model themselves after to a certain point. 
</P>
<P>
"To be respected by your peers, to know you've come such a long way and that 
people recognize it is nice," he said. "I think that's the key thing, that 
people can look at me and understand all that I've been through and that I 
stuck it out. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to hopefully wash away one of the layers of that stereotype that's 
put on athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Butler's extraordinary mix of talent and background, Butler's story 
has attracted national attention. ESPN's "Scholastic Sports America" program 
did a profile on Butler that aired three weeks ago. Its focus was Butler's 
transition from the city to suburbia, and how he has handled the attendant 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out well," Butler said. "Basically, we got to see the full, entire 
circle with me out here and me at home." 
</P>
<P>
Well-roundedness, it would appear, translates well to the TV screen, too.

RESEDA'S NOMADIC JEFF HALPERN SPECIALIZES IN BASKETBALL REVIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitors to the Reseda High gym can't help but notice the Lion. There, larger 
than life on the south wall, is a painting of the school's mascot, the Regent. 
Stylized with humanlike facial features, it sports a white tank top and holds a 
basketball in one paw and a volleyball in the other. It has a look of nobility 
to it, one benefitting the king of beasts, but one that seemed out of place 
until this year. For in previous seasons, the Reseda boys' basketball team had 
distinguished itself as anything but a king. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
In 1985-86, Reseda was 5-16 and winless (0-12) in Valley 4-A League play. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986-87, the team was 6-13 and 2-10, but with the school's football (2-A 
Division) and the girls' basketball (3-A) teams winning City Section titles, 
the improvement paled in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987-88, the Regents sank to new depths, compiling a 2-14 record (1-11 in 
league play) while the girls' team was successfully defending its City title 
and the boys' soccer and volleyball (3-A) teams were winning their first City 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were pretty bleak," said Coley Kyman, a two-year starter at quarterback 
on the football team and at forward-center on the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"Before this year, we were used to losing. We went into games expecting to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
Then Jeff Halpern replaced Tim Nakano as coach in September, and things began 
to change, albeit slowly at first. 
</P>
<P>
After starting the season with six losses, the Regents (9-10) won nine of their 
last 13 games, finished second to North Hollywood with a 7-3 record in the 
Mid-Valley League and will play at Wilson in the first round of the City 3-A 
playoffs at 7:30 tonight -- their first postseason appearance in four years. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Reseda's move from the 4-A to the 3-A has been 
instrumental in its resurgence, but Halpern also has played a major role in the 
Regents' drive to respectability. 
</P>
<P>
After coaching Van Nuys to a 21-3 record during the 1984-85 season and guiding 
Birmingham to a 22-3 mark in 1986-87, Halpern came to Reseda with a reputation 
as a winner. But he also was known as a nomad, having also lasted only one 
season (1987-88) as an assistant at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife has told me to at least try and stay at a school more than one year," 
Halpern said. "That's kind of a standing joke around the house. . . . I never 
intended to move around as much as I have. It's just turned out that way." 
</P>
<P>
Halpern, 45, said that the Reseda job has been the most challenging and 
rewarding -- and at times, frustrating -- of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"We were coming from two ends of the spectrum when I came here," Halpern said. 
"The kids were coming from a program that hadn't won in years and I was used to 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
After opening the season with an 84-30 stomping at the feet of Taft, followed 
by a 70-44 rout by Wilson, Halpern had serious doubts about whether he was up 
to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost to Taft by 50 points, I really took it personally," Halpern said. 
"I thought, 'What am I doing here?' I blamed it on myself. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, when I saw teams getting killed, I wondered how a coach could let that 
happen. But now I know how." 
</P>
<P>
However, neither of those losses caused Halpern as much grief as a 70-59 
overtime loss to Birmingham in a consolation-bracket game of the North 
Hollywood tournament in December. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda led by eight with two minutes left in regulation only to lose its sixth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"That one really hurt," Halpern said. "We let that one get away. The kids 
weren't used to leading that late in the game and they fell apart. They didn't 
know how to win those tight games." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Regents began to turn their season around with a win against 
Birmingham three games later. In that game, they came from behind to defeat the 
Braves, 43-42, in the third-place game of the Birmingham tournament. They 
followed that with a 71-59 victory over Poly in a Valley Pac-8 Conference 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
"The victory against Birmingham was a big win," assistant Mohamed Marhaba said. 
"Even though they're not a powerhouse, they are a legitimate team." 
</P>
<P>
Marhaba, the sixth man on Halpern's Van Nuys squad that advanced to the 3-A 
semifinals, was an assistant under Halpern at Birmingham and gladly came to 
Reseda with his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of like a homecoming," Marhaba said. "So when he asked if I wanted 
to coach with him, I didn't hesitate." 
</P>
<P>
Establishing good relationships with his players has been a key to Halpern's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always tried to develop a good rapport with the kids," he said. "I'm not 
the smartest tactician as far as X's and O's go, but I think I'm able to get 
the most out of the kids. I think I'm able to get kids to want to play for me. 
</P>
<P>
"If you sit too far above the kids, when it comes down to it, and you need them 
in that really critical situation, they're not going to perform for you." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Cook, the leader of Halpern's Van Nuys team and a forward at Arizona, 
attributed much of his mentor's success to concern for his players' welfare. 
</P>
<P>
"You can just tell that he really relates to all his players and cares about 
what happens to them, both on and off the court," said Cook, an All-Pacific 10 
Conference selection last year. "And that makes you want to play for him. It 
makes a big difference to you as a player knowing that your coach cares about 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that Halpern's friendship with the Van Nuys players helped transform 
the Wolves into a better team. "We did things off the court together," Cook 
said. "We had team dinners at various players' houses and we went to movies and 
sometimes to other games together. We were a very close-knit team and it showed 
in the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
Halpern has a special fondness for that team, which was upset by San Pedro, 
77-70, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Halpern had established himself as a legitimate varsity coach 
after 10 years at the B and C level at Grant, his alma mater. But any 
satisfaction was diminished quickly when Van Nuys released him from his 
position at the end of the school year because of budget cuts. "I was 
devastated. I felt like I had made a name for myself and it was yanked out from 
under me," Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
Halpern began teaching at Birmingham in the fall of 1985, after his release, 
but did not coach basketball until a year later when Jim O'Hara retired. He 
immediately guided the Braves (12-11 a year earlier) to the Northwest Valley 
League title and the City 3-A final, which they lost to Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Though his job was secure, Halpern took the position at Canyons last season 
while still teaching five classes at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get a taste of coaching at the collegiate level," Halpern said. "I 
thought it'd be challenging, so I took the job when the opportunity presented 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Halpern intended to return to Canyons this season, but when Birmingham told him 
that he would have to teach six classes instead of five -- thus interfering 
with his duties at the Valencia campus -- he took the job at Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot at COC," Halpern said. "But I also learned that I need to be a 
head coach. After having your own program for so many years, even if it's at 
the B and C level, it's different working for someone else. You don't have as 
much input and the kids look at you in a different way, without as much 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
And respect is important to Halpern. "I expect what I give," he said. "If the 
kids don't give back to me as much as I give out, then I get upset." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, there's been little upsetting about his stay at Reseda. But will 
Halpern stick around? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've found a home at Reseda. I feel comfortable there," he said. 
"But if a head coaching position opened up at the community college level, I do 
believe I could hold my own."

VALLEY FORFEITS FINAL 2 GAMES; INELIGIBILITY OF PLAYERS CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Valley College basketball team, which forfeited a Western State Conference 
game against Glendale on Wednesday because only four players showed up on time, 
also will forfeit its two remaining games, Valley Athletic Director George Goff 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Goff said that the decision not to complete the season was made after a review 
of academic records from the first semester revealed poor attendance and 
failing grades for several players that would have made them ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no alternative," said Goff, who could not recall a similar situation 
involving a team sport at Valley during his 17 years as athletic director. "The 
only thing you could do is get some people from the football team, but that 
wouldn't be putting forward a worthwhile program. It's a sad situation, but 
that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Coach Jim Stephens said that despite multiple warnings, several of his 
players failed to attend classes regularly or show up on time for practices and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Joey Manliguis left the team last week because of academic problems 
and forward Earl Davis became ineligible for not paying his out-of-state 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Valley had been in contention for a berth in the Southern California regional 
playoffs. The Monarchs conclude the season 17-15 overall and 7-8 in conference 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad and disappointing for everyone concerned but at this point it's the 
only answer," Stephens said. "It was my 27th season in coaching and it was a 
big lesson for me." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Tory Stephens, the team leader in scoring, said that some of his 
teammates' problems were caused by a lack of transportation from their homes in 
Los Angeles to the Van Nuys campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad for the sophomores because it was their last year," he said. "But 
coach was tired of putting up with people's . . . I can understand where he's 
coming from because there was a lot of stuff that went on this season." 
</P>
<P>
Valley-area junior college coaches said the problems that plagued Valley this 
season are indicative of the struggle faced by many programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a never-ending battle," said Canyons Coach Lee Smelser, whose team was 
supposed to play Valley on Monday. "We try to communicate the need to get it 
done in the classroom as best we can. The kids have to accept some of the 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Said Glendale's Brian Beauchemin: "Kids are at junior colleges because they 
have academic or athletic shortcomings. The kids that do well understand where 
they're at and work to get better. Those who don't overestimate their abilities 
and they have trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Goff said that the basketball program would return next season and that he 
hopes returning and incoming players will learn a lesson from Thursday's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're at a place like USC and you've got scholarships, you can start 
wheeling a mallet around," Goff said. "It's a little tougher in the JCs. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are already getting a second chance athletic-wise or academic-wise. 
How many chances can you get?"

<P>
The South Coast Conference basketball tournament starts tonight at El Camino at 
7 when Cerritos (24-4, 5-3), the SCC's second-place team, faces Long Beach 
(18-12, 5-3). The Falcons were upset, 87-84, by third-place Long Beach in the 
SCC finale Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 p.m. the league champion El Camino Warriors (21-7, 6-2) will play the 
winner of Thursday's Pasadena-Mt. San Antonio game. Mt. SAC is the league's 
last-place team and Pasadena (16-18, 4-4), which has lost twice to El Camino, 
is in fourth. The Warriors finished the regular season with a 91-75 victory 
over Long Beach, and Pasadena ended conference action with a 102-75 win over 
Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's two league losses were on the road against Long Beach and Cerritos. 
The Warriors were upset by the Vikings, 98-91, in January and lost to Cerritos, 
64-63, at the buzzer Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's winners will play for the tournament title at 7:30 p.m. Saturday.

The Loyola Marymount University women's basketball team will try to keep its 
slim title hopes alive when the Lions take their last road trip this weekend, 
starting tonight at Portland. They play Saturday at Gonzaga. Both games begin 
at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions are 15-9 overall and 7-3 in the West Coast Athletic Conference, two 
games behind co-leaders St. Mary's and Gonzaga with four games to play. 
Portland is tied for fourth at 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Lynn Flanagan leads Loyola at 11.3 points per game. Also in double 
figures are center Tricia Gibson (10.4), forward Regan O'Hara (10.2) and guard 
Kristen Bruich (10). O'Hara leads the rebounders at seven per game. Bruich 
ranks among WCAC leaders in assists (third at 5.5) and steals (second at 2.8). 
</P>
<P>
Portland, 6-18 overall and 5-8 at home, has been led lately by freshman guard 
Martha Sheldon. ALAN DROOZ

THE TURN; 
</P>
<P>
THE FRONT SIDE OF HIS GOLF CAREER HAS BEEN A SUCCESS, BUT GEORGE ARCHER HAS A 
FEW HOLES LEFT ON THE SENIOR TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In professional golf, a player can be an aging veteran one day and a rookie the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
Life on the Senior PGA Tour begins at 50, and this fact isn't lost on George 
Archer. With his 50th birthday coming up Oct. 1, he will have the distinction 
of playing on both the regular PGA Tour and the senior tour in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that Archer, who lives in Gilroy, is coasting through his 
last full season with the younger guys. He shot a three-under-par 69 Thursday 
in the first round of the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
The senior tour has become so attractive and so lucrative that many golfers 
can't wait until they turn 50. Just when a man's career on the regular tour is 
winding down, he gets a chance for a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something big for me to look forward to," Archer said after his 
opening round. "I've been lucky to be able to keep playing, earn a little money 
and have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the summer off and do some fishing, then play about four more 
tournaments before I hit 50. I'll be able to get in four or five senior events 
before the year is out, and I want to win one so I can play in the Tournament 
of Champions (at La Costa) next year." 
</P>
<P>
This is Archer's 26th season on the PGA Tour -- only Jack Nicklaus (28) and Ray 
Floyd (27) have been around longer -- and he has felt for some time that there 
was room for a second tour. Nicklaus will be eligible for the senior tour in 
January, 1990; Floyd late in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to think there should be two tours, like the two leagues in baseball," 
Archer said. "Nobody dreamed that the senior tour would develop like it has, 
but actually, it's a natural. Older people know all the names, and they're 
watching golfers their own age. They can relate." 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the regular tour in 1964, Archer has won 13 tournaments and 
$1,830,991. His list of victories includes the 1969 Masters and the 1971 
forerunner of this event, then called the Andy Williams San Diego Open. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think winning the Masters was the highlight of my career, but it 
wasn't," he said. "My biggest thrill was my first win, the Lucky International, 
because it was close to where I grew up in San Francisco. That was in '65. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the Crosby in '69 was a big thrill, too. When I was a kid, I saw it on 
TV and said to myself, 'Some day I want to play in that tournament.' Then to 
win it was something that will always be special to me." 
</P>
<P>
Archer's most memorable achievement, one that put his name in the PGA record 
book, was his total of 94 putts for four rounds in the 1980 Heritage Classic in 
Hilton Head, S.C. (surprisingly, he didn't win). 
</P>
<P>
"I think that record will stand awhile," Archer said. "I'll probably be dead a 
long time before anybody breaks it. Do you realize that's an average of just 23 
1/2 putts per round? 
</P>
<P>
"The course had small greens, or I couldn't have done it. Still, nobody has 
done it since." 
</P>
<P>
Putting never has been a problem for Archer, who has built a reputation as one 
of the best in the business on the greens. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly can't gripe about my putting today," he said. "In fact, I liked my 
whole round (35-34). I had four birdies, and my only bogey was on the first 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a good drive on No. 1, but my iron hooked into a trap. I don't know if 
there was mud on the ball or not, but it didn't act right. There was a lot of 
mud on that hole. They ruined some places on the course with the sprinklers." 
</P>
<P>
Playing in a threesome with George Cadle and Buddy Gardner, Archer took 4 hours 
20 minutes to tour the South Course. He said this was too long, and blamed it 
on the fact that many younger golfers today pattern their games after the 
slow-playing Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicklaus would take forever, and kids would copy him," Archer said. "Why 
wouldn't they copy the greatest player in the world? He's to golf what Babe 
Ruth was to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a bad thing that they've done. Guys come out of college and play so 
darn slow, it's ridiculous. Now some of the (LPGA players) take five minutes to 
line up chip shots. It's driving me nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Should the PGA have done something about Nicklaus' deliberate tactics? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Archer said. "But it's pretty hard to tell the world's greatest 
player how to play."

LAFFITTE SCORES 47 AS USIU ROMPS

<P>
The score of U.S. International University's 127-114 victory over Point Loma 
Nazarene at Golden Hall Thursday was the least significant number of the game. 
</P>
<P>
More important for the Gulls were a third consecutive victory, fourth in the 
past five games, and an 11-14 record. The 11 victories equal the most in a 
season since Gary Zarecky became coach four years ago and are only two short of 
the school record of 13 set in the 1980-81 season, when USIU was 13-12. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Demetrius Laffitte added some significant numbers of his own in the 
Gulls' final appearance in Golden Hall this season. Laffitte scored a 
career-high 47 points and had a season-high 18 rebounds. He was 19 of 31 from 
the field and 9 of 10 from the line and had 14 offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Crusaders, an NAIA team, their most significant numbers 
were 6-feet-4, 6-3, 6-4, 6-0, 6-2. That's the height of their starting lineup, 
and it doesn't get much taller with 6-5 reserve Mark Dirksen. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls took advantage of the height discrepancy at will, outrebounding the 
Crusaders, 40-24, on their way to a 65-49 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome was never really in doubt, although USIU suffered enough mental 
lapses to keep the Crusaders in the game. USIU had its biggest lead, 100-71, 
with 12 minutes remaining, but PLNC outscored the Gulls, 16-3, over the next 3 
minutes to pull within 103-87. 
</P>
<P>
USIU increased the lead to 117-97 with 4 minutes remaining before the Crusaders 
went on a 9-2 run. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of height has hurt PLNC (7-20) all season. The Crusaders lost Mike Flores, 
a 6-10 center from Mt. Miguel High School, to reconstructive knee surgery 
before the season, and Steve Riddle, a 6-6 All-Golden State Athletic Conference 
center last season, was out for the year when it was discovered that he had 
detached knee ligaments during preseason. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Crusaders couldn't play with Gulls, they were forced to run with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play that bad when we were running, it's just that they're better at 
it," said Ted Anderson, PLNC's coach. "It's tough. We didn't exactly slow them 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky ran 11 players onto the court and all scored, including four in double 
figures. Steve Smith and Gary Williams had 18 points apiece, and Smith added 
eight assists. Ron Hubbard led PLNC with 27 points, and Mark Ryan added 26. 
</P>
<P>
Although the recent numbers are providing optimism for USIU, its most important 
ones may be ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls travel to play South Dakota, an NCAA Division II team, Monday before 
returning to San Diego to play San Diego State (Feb. 25) and the University of 
San Diego (Feb. 28) in their final games of the season.

RAMONA DOES TURNAROUND IN SECOND HALF TO BEAT SAN MARCOS

<TEXT>
<P>
The girls' basketball game between Ramona and San Marcos Thursday night evolved 
into something resembling "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like we were two different teams out there," Ramona's Kris Miller said 
after Ramona stormed back from a 29-9 halftime deficit to defeat sixth-ranked 
San Marcos, the Avocado League champion, 51-44. 
</P>
<P>
"All week," Miller said, "we were saying, 'We're not going to let San Marcos go 
undefeated in league.' " 
</P>
<P>
But visiting Ramona (18-3, 12-2) came painfully close to missing deadline on 
the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos came out in the first half and denied Ramona the chance to shoot, 
rebound, pass and score, taking a 13-6 first-quarter lead and extending it in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just comatose in the first half," said Miller, who was held scoreless 
before halftime but came alive, along with her teammates, after a brutal 
halftime talk by Ramona Coach Joe Bess to finish with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He usually never yells at us," Miller said. "But we've never been down by that 
much, either." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos (18-6, 13-1) was already assured of the league championship after 
Tuesday's victory over Oceanside, which at the time was tied for second place 
with Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos' Suzie O'Brien, the county's leading scorer at just under 30 points 
a game, was effective in the first half, scoring 15 points and pulling down 
eight rebounds. But as the game wore on, Ramona chipped away at the Knights' 
lead and that effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien scored just 11 points (with two field goals) in the second half. Four 
of her seven second-half free throws came after Ramona had taken a 47-38 lead, 
cutting the deficit to 47-42. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona took its first lead -- 39-38 -- with 4:26 remaining on Miller's shot off 
her own rebound. The Bulldogs scored then eight more points in a row to end a 
15-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so hard when you kill them in the first half," O'Brien said. "I don't 
know what happened. Nothing fell, and they played a great defensive game."

FARSI-LANGUAGE VIDEOS HELP REMIND IRANIANS OF HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To find the Farsi-language videos in Ali Massoudi's shop, customers have to 
file past chilled meats, stacked vegetables, rows of cereal boxes and other 
items that line the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Sepah, Massoudi's store on Culver Drive in Irvine, is typical for the various 
Iranian communities scattered throughout Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
Besides foodstuffs and imported or locally printed newspapers and magazines 
written in Farsi -- Iran's native language -- Sepah features more than 250 
videocassettes appealing to Iranian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"There really aren't any places that (specialize solely) in videos for my 
people, at least not that I know of," the 52-year-old shopkeeper explained. 
"Like my place, we have much that would be of interest (to Iranians); videos 
are just one of the things they come to get." 
</P>
<P>
Massoudi, who said he was an editor for an anti-Khomeini newspaper before 
leaving Iran in 1981, usually rents about 125 per week and sells one every now 
and then. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the tapes are full-length features with soft-focus romance, 
frenetic adventure or slapsticky comedy themes. And most are fairly old, having 
been made in Iran during the shah's reign, which ended a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Massoudi explained that most videos are 90-minute, government-approved popular 
movies and somewhat shorter tapes of Iranian television programs. Many tapes 
were brought over by emigrants after the shah's fall in 1979 and then 
circulated among their friends. 
</P>
<P>
"They reflect the entertainment in my country before Khomeini. There were many 
movies made during those days," he said. "Of course, with Khomeini (in power) 
there are no new movies being made." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Behbehani, a 49-year-old Orange businessman who was leaving Massoudi's shop 
with an armload of groceries, emphasized the importance of the movies in 
generating a pleasant sense of nostalgia. Many of the tapes depict Iran in a 
more pleasurable, liberated time, he said, so they are attractive to Iranians 
who fled the Khomeini regime. 
</P>
<P>
But love of the videos he frequently rents has not been passed on to his 
children: two teen-age boys and a 10-year-old daughter. They find the tapes 
archaic and, because of their simplistic plots, even silly. 
</P>
<P>
"My kids like the big (English-language) releases, they are (impatient) with 
these when I bring them home. They very much like big movies other teen-agers 
like; ones with their teen-age stars." 
</P>
<P>
Massoudi noted that in the Los Angeles area there is a busy underground 
industry featuring Iranian actors and directors. But the films are seldom 
full-length works with sustained story lines; instead, he said, these 60-minute 
videos feature singers and dancers performing beloved Iranian tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Like Massoudi, Amir Moini runs a little market that also features dozens of 
Farsi-language videos. His store, called Pacific Health Food and known as 
Salamat to Iranians, is on Tustin Avenue in Orange, which also has an active 
Iranian population. 
</P>
<P>
Moini, who was an Iranian government official from 1969 to 1977, came to the 
United States in 1979 and opened the store shortly thereafter. He stocks up to 
200 videocassettes and, like Massoudi, also routinely places orders for 
customer rentals with two distribution companies operating out of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I have very much business," Moini said. "They love the adventures, also the 
romance films are very big. People want to remember their culture. The videos 
sometimes help them do that." 
</P>
<P>
Massoudi agreed that many older Iranians see the tapes as a way to keep 
traditions intact by showing them to their children. They also help to get 
their offspring -- who may only speak English and be interested in an 
assimilated life style -- to study Farsi and respect the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
"But, mainly, they like them just so they can recall what their country is 
like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Farsi-language cassettes, Massoudi rents a handful of older 
American films that have been dubbed for Iranians, such as "Ben-Hur" and "El 
Cid." He does not keep any English-language videos in stock. 
</P>
<P>
As for his own preference, he said he'd rather watch big-budget 
English-language movies, mainly because the technology is such a leap over the 
Iranian films. 
</P>
<P>
"The condition of the cassettes is usually very bad, very grainy and 
(difficult) to watch. The movies are old to begin with, you see, and then they 
are copied poorly. No, they are not really my favorite." 
</P>

COLORIZED 'CASABLANCA' COMING SOON TO HOME VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would you paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa? Or resculpt Michaelangelo's David 
to add muscle tone? Or colorize "Casablanca"? 
</P>
<P>
That's a version of a popular quiz offered by outraged purists opposed to 
computerized colorization of black-and-white film classics. Mona Lisa and David 
are safe from alteration, but "Casablanca" isn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Casablanca" has been colorized. This version, which recently debuted on 
national TV, will be available Tuesday for the first time on home video 
(MGM/UA, $79.95). The black-and-white original was released to home-video years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 1942 film, starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, is 
regarded as one of the two or three greatest romantic dramas in movie history. 
Set in Nazi-occupied Casablanca, it's about a rekindled romance between 
nightclub-owner Rick (Bogart) and Ilse (Bergman), who's married to French 
resistance leader Victor (Henreid). 
</P>
<P>
Tampering with "Casablanca," purists charge, is sacrilege. But millionaire 
entrepreneur Ted Turner, who owns the rights to this and many other film 
classics, can do whatever he wants with them -- unless the director's contract 
forbids alterations. 
</P>
<P>
If you're one of millions who're used to seeing "Casablanca" in 
black-and-white, the color may be a bit unsettling -- simply because it changes 
the feel of the movie. But many won't be disturbed by the change. That's the 
crowd MGM/UA is courting. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who've never seen it or who don't like black-and-white 
movies," argued MGM/UA senior vice president Herb Fischer. "Colorization makes 
the movie accessible to a new audience. For one thing, lots of young people 
have never seen it. They've grown up on color movies and are more likely to be 
comfortable with a color movie." 
</P>
<P>
So far, video retailers haven't ordered many copies of the colorized version. 
Fischer wouldn't reveal figures but indicated that only a few thousand had been 
sold to retailers and distributors. "It's what we expected, considering the 
price," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That $79.95 price is a mystery. Usually such a high price is reserved for new 
movies sold to retailers as rentals. But old movies are usually introduced in 
the $20 to $30 range -- a price appealing to collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The high pricing decision, said Steve Chamberlain, vice president of Turner 
Home Entertainment, was made by Turner himself. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? "He doesn't have to give any," Chamberlain said. "He's the boss." 
</P>
<P>
The high price isn't the only factor slowing sales to retailers. Some, such as 
Meir Hed, co-owner of the local Videotheque chain, won't stock it on principle. 
</P>
<P>
"Colorization is offensive," he said. "Many of my customers are film lovers 
who'd be offended by it. You can't duplicate original colors with this process. 
It destroys what the director intended to do with black-and-white. It's wrong. 
I won't support it." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the argument of film purists, Hed added: "If they can colorize, they 
could do something like dub in a voice in some classic movies because they 
think another voice sounds better. They can make all sorts of changes. If they 
get away with colorization, where will it end?" 
</P>
<P>
Such protests aren't having an impact at Turner, however. Colorization -- 
which, Chamberlain said, costs about $200,000 per movie -- won't go away for a 
simple reason: It's profitable. "There's usually an even split in the orders -- 
half for black-and-white and half for color," Chamberlain said. "People think 
colorized videos don't sell well, but they do." 
</P>
<P>
So far the home video market hasn't been flooded with colorized movies. 
According to Chamberlain, there are about 20 colorized titles on home video, 
selling for $20 to $30. Turner has 15 of these titles, including "The Maltese 
Falcon," "Dark Victory," "White Heat" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy." 
</P>
<P>
The home-video profits from colorized classics tend to trickle in slowly. 
According to Fischer, the colorized "Yankee Doodle Dandy" is a big seller, at 
about 20,000 copies, which is a pittance next to the 400,000 to 500,000 units 
sold of the average hit movie. The classics, though, sell steadily. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of current hit movies are hot for a few months and have very little life 
after that," Fischer said. "Something like 'Casablanca' will sell forever. 
That's why marketing the classics is good business." 
</P>
<P>
After 9 to 12 months on the market, the price of the colorized "Casablanca" 
will drop to the $20-$30 range, matching the cost of the black-and-white 
version, Fischer predicted. "We'll sell a lot more then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Turner has colorized more than 100 movies. "Citizen Kane" was scheduled 
for colorization, but a clause in director Orson Welles' contract -- one that's 
rare in directors' contracts -- forbids creative tampering. 
</P>
<P>
The next colorized movie scheduled for release -- this time on Turner Home 
Entertainment -- is "King Kong," later this month.

CARL'S JR. CHIEF ACCOUNTANT CHARGED WITH STOCK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chief accountant for the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain was indicted Thursday 
on a criminal charge of securities fraud through insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury returned a one-count indictment against Alvin A. DeShano 
of Orange, accusing him of receiving and using confidential corporate 
information to avoid a stock market loss of $7,107. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, 53, also was one of 16 people accused of insider-trading violations in 
a civil lawsuit filed in federal court last April by the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC lawsuit accused Carl N. Karcher, chairman and chief executive of 
Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, 14 family members and DeShano of 
avoiding stock market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, David M. Wiechert of Irvine's Layman, Jones &amp; Dye law firm, 
said his client's "integrity and honesty are above reproach. . . . He never 
would have intended to deceive or defraud anyone. Obviously, we intend to 
vigorously defend these charges through trial, if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Wiechert said DeShano did not rely on any inside information when he traded 
shares of Karcher stock. "He had legitimate reasons for diversifying his 
investments and assets at the time of the sale that were wholly unrelated to 
the information" that DeShano allegedly used. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, six of the defendants in the SEC lawsuit -- including 
company President Donald F. Karcher -- agreed to pay a total of $187,560 in 
civil fines and penalties to end their involvement in the civil case. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, without a trial, a federal judge found Carl Leo Karcher, a son 
of Carl N. Karcher, guilty of civil insider trading charges. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining defendants, including DeShano, are scheduled to begin trial April 
11 in the SEC lawsuit. All of the defendants in the SEC suit have said they did 
not violate insider trading laws. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, described by one associate as a soft-spoken accountant, is the only 
defendant in the civil case who has been criminally charged with insider 
trading. The criminal indictment is a separate proceeding from the civil 
lawsuit, although both stem from DeShano's stock trades in October, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Seek Delay 
</P>
<P>
He will ask U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie to order that he not begin 
trial in April with the other defendants to give him time to prepare for the 
criminal proceedings and because his case is based on different circumstances, 
Wiechert said. "There's no one else involved in Al's transaction," the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the criminal charges, DeShano could be sentenced to 5 years in 
prison and fined a maximum of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although DeShano was the only defendant to be indicted, the Karcher family 
members accused in the SEC civil action could still face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is subject to further criminal investigation," said Irving Einhorn, 
SEC regional administrator in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that as director of general accounting at Karcher 
Enterprises, DeShano had access to the chain's non-public financial data. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, 1984, according to the government, he received a preliminary 
financial report indicating that the company's earnings for the 4 weeks ending 
Oct. 5 would be 83% lower than expected, and "substantially lower" than the 
company's earnings for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, on Oct. 15, DeShano allegedly sold 1,725 shares of Karcher 
stock at $23 per share -- allowing him to avoid losses when news of the 
company's expected losses were made public on Oct. 23 and the stock price 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Karcher Enterprises Chief Financial Officer Loren 
Pannier said the company understands that DeShano will plead not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, Al remains an active employee" of the company, Pannier said. 
"This matter should have no effect on the company's business." 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor, William Bateman, said DeShano, an ex-Marine and father of five, 
loves his job at Karcher Enterprises and described him as a "workaholic." 
</P>
<P>
"He's been my neighbor for 17 years, and if you went out to pick a neighbor you 
couldn't pick a better one," Bateman said. 
</P>
<P>
Venita Baker, another neighbor, expressed similar sentiments. "I find it very 
hard to believe that he is the kind of person that would do something like 
that," she said. "If anything, it was done out of ignorance, or he was told to 
by his employer." 
</P>
<P>
DeShano is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 27. His case should go to trial in 
early May. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Holliday, an attorney for Carl N. Karcher, said the DeShano indictment will 
have no effect on the pending SEC civil suit against his client and immediate 
relatives. The charges against DeShano "are totally independent and unrelated 
to Carl," Holliday said. "There is no suggestion that there is any link between 
DeShano and Carl Karcher at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SEC Case 
</P>
<P>
DeShano and Carl Leo Karcher, the family member who was found guilty of civil 
insider trading charges 5 months ago, were the only two defendants in the SEC 
case who were alleged to have directly traded securities on the basis of 
non-public information to which they had direct personal access. Carl N. 
Karcher and the other defendants are accused of either tipping others or 
selling securities on the basis of tips they received.

DeShano, on the other hand, "was right there," Einhorn said. "He had the books 
in front of him and he acted on that information. The rest who traded are 
either tippees or tippers, and they aren't company employees." 
</P>
<P>
At the time he was indicted, DeShano had been negotiating with the SEC to reach 
a settlement of the civil charges filed against him, Wiechert said. "Those 
discussions obviously aren't pertinent anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment marks the third time in recent years that criminal charges have 
been brought in the central district of California concerning alleged insider 
trading violations, a spokeswoman with the U.S. attorney's office said.

SCHOOL DISTRICTS' 'SPECIAL TAX' REMAINS INVALID 
</P>

<P>
The state Supreme Court dealt a setback Thursday to school districts in 
fast-growing communities, limiting their ability to impose special taxes or 
fees on developers to pay the full costs of educational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, over one dissent, refused to hear a challenge to a ruling last 
November by a state Court of Appeal that struck down a voter-approved tax of as 
much as $6,300 on each new home built within five districts in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The three-judge appeal court held that the tax was invalid either as a "special 
tax" allowed with two-thirds voter approval under Proposition 13 or as a 
"development fee" that schools may impose, but only up to $1.50 a square foot 
of a new residence. 
</P>
<P>
The panel ruled further that the tax was illegal because it was not imposed 
uniformly on residents and property owners throughout the community, but would 
be borne only by developers and future residents. 
</P>
<P>
The high court's action, taken in a brief order issued Thursday, means the 
appellate ruling becomes binding on trial courts throughout the state. Only 
Justice Stanley Mosk voted to review the appellate court decision -- leaving 
the matter three votes short of the number required. 
</P>
<P>
The case had drawn wide attention in the wake of a flurry of recent efforts by 
local governmental agencies to impose fees on developers to provide for 
schools, roads and other facilities required by rapid population growth. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County school officials, however, said they are not directly affected by 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
None of the Orange County school districts that impose fees attempted the kind 
of tax vote that the five Santa Clarita school districts did. Rather, they did 
so under existing legislation that allows them to charge up to $1.50 per square 
foot for residential construction, sometimes in combination with other 
agreements with developers to pick up part of the construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said Thursday's ruling would make negotiations on the issue of 
new school funding between schools and developers even more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked out really well," said Anthony Dalessi, assistant 
superintendent at the Santa Ana Unified School District. "Developers have never 
been real crazy about paying." 
</P>
<P>
Already, developers in Orange County have challenged the use of the 
state-allowed developers fee. 
</P>
<P>
In November, a Superior Court ruling declared that the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District had improperly imposed the maximum state-allowed fee on 
developers. The court agreed with developers who argued that the school 
district, which is facing a declining enrollment, was using the revenue from 
the fees for maintenance and repairs, when the legislation intended it to be 
used for capital construction. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County and most school districts in the state had abided by the 
statutory limit on developer fees, the effort by the districts in the Santa 
Clarita Valley to impose what they called a "special tax" to obtain far more 
revenue for long-range educational needs could have led to similar moves 
throughout California, lawyers and officials said. 
</P>
<P>
William Ingram, president of the California School Boards Assn., said school 
authorities from across the state had been hopeful that the appellate court 
ruling would be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Back to Drawing Board' 
</P>
<P>
"That would have given us an out," he said. "Now, we're back to the drawing 
board." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where school construction is a critical topic among school 
administrators because of growing population, the case had been studied 
carefully. School officials here say they do not blame the Santa Clarita 
schools for trying to find a creative solution to a desperate situation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why school districts engage in these games," said Paul Reed, deputy 
superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District. "The need is so great, 
and the number of projects to be funded is so great." 
</P>
<P>
Reed, whose district has faced an annual growth in enrollment of 2% to 5% in 
the last few years, said there is a $5-billion backlog of requests in the state 
school building fund. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, Sonoma County Counsel James P. Botz, representing a coalition 
of 14 counties that supported the five school districts in the case, voiced 
concern that the ruling could encourage legal challenges to a wide range of 
voter-approved, post-Proposition 13 special taxes enacted by cities, counties 
and special districts. 
</P>
<P>
Botz noted, for example, that under the decision a hotel occupancy tax -- borne 
primarily by visitors and not voters -- might face a legal challenge because it 
was not uniformly imposed. 
</P>
<P>
"It could really narrow the kind of taxes that local governments can impose 
under Proposition 13," he said. "Those kind of taxes are difficult enough to 
obtain because they have to be approved by two-thirds of the voters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Minimal Effect 
</P>
<P>
However, Alvin S. Kaufer, a Los Angeles attorney who represented the California 
Building Industry Assn. in a suit against the tax at issue in the case, said 
the ruling would have minimal impact, affecting only a relatively small number 
of school districts that have tried to impose a special revenue measure. 
</P>
<P>
The Court of Appeal opinion, he added, stopped far short of requiring absolute 
uniformity in the burdens imposed by a special tax -- and thus may pose little 
threat to such measures. There is still room for special taxes to contain 
reasonable rate differentials, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The primary effect will be to retain the status quo," Kaufer said. "If the 
decision had gone the other way, there would have been chaos. Residents in any 
school, sewer or mosquito-abatement district in the state could go out and tax 
new residences in any amount and nothing could be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
The case arose after voters in the Newhall, William S. Hart, Saugus, Castaic 
and Sulphur Springs school districts in Los Angeles County approved the special 
tax by a two-thirds vote in June, 1987.

AFTER KEY RESIGNATION, PELTASON ORDERS STUDY OF UCI MEDICAL SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason said Thursday that he will assemble a 
panel of expert consultants to examine problems in UCI's troubled medical 
school after the resignation of Dr. Edward J. Quilligan as vice chancellor of 
health sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Quilligan's resignation earlier this week as vice chancellor and dean of the 
College of Medicine will become effective no later than March 15, upon 
selection of an interim dean, Peltason said in a statement issued from San 
Francisco, where he was attending a UC Board of Regents meeting. The acting 
dean is expected to be chosen from among UCI's medical faculty. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the rapidly changing nature of demands on and needs of the medical 
school, I am bringing in some expert faculty and administration from other 
institutions to serve as professional consultants to me and to the faculty," 
Peltason said in a letter to the medical school faculty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consultants From UC System 
</P>
<P>
The consultants, to be assembled next week, will be selected from within the UC 
system, UCI spokeswoman Linda Granell said. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory panel will also consult with UCI's Academic Senate, the faculty 
body that sets curriculum. The same search committee that brought Quilligan to 
UCI from Davis in October, 1986, will be reactivated to find a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Quilligan, an internationally recognized authority on Cesarian sections and 
fetal monitoring who has been president of the American Obstetrics and 
Gynecology Society, will return to teaching and a clinical practice in 
affiliation with the university. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a tumultuous tenure, Quilligan's resignation took most faculty members 
by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors swirled on campus and at UCI Medical Center in Orange on Thursday. 
Well-connected faculty members and administrators advanced opinions that seemed 
to depend as much on their alliances as their vantage points -- that Quilligan 
was fired by Peltason, or that he quit because he could not unify the faculty 
and wanted to make way for someone who could. 
</P>
<P>
Quilligan and Peltason, the only ones who really knew, were not talking 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost an Astute Mediator 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cyril Barton, associate professor and kidney specialist who is among 
faculty physicians opposing Quilligan's plan to require doctors to pay up to 
60% of their outside earnings to the medical school, said Quilligan lost a 
politically astute mediator when his No. 2 man, Dr. Philip DiSaia, resigned as 
associate vice chancellor because of a heart condition in January. 
</P>
<P>
Quilligan then was on his own to answer for personnel problems and a Medical 
Center deficit that leaped from $1 million in 1986 to a projected $12 million 
this year, Barton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Quilligan had this problem of a huge medical center deficit, and he lost the 
confidence and respect of the rank-and-file faculty," Barton said. "When DiSaia 
became ill, Quilligan came under fire from above." 
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking administrator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described 
Quilligan's problems as "cumulative." The administrator said Quilligan stepped 
aside despite Peltason's urgings that he stay on. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the chancellor and Prof. Quilligan saw eye to eye on long-range 
goals," the administrator said. "The fact that there was disruption over the 
compensation plan was not the reason -- anytime you deal with the salaries of 
physicians, there are going to be complainers. And there was a deficit at the 
hospital, but there is always going to be a deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem was that Prof. Quilligan was unable to get past those issues 
and unite the faculty and move forward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough, demanding job, and sometimes someone comes to the conclusion 
that 'this is more than I can handle,' " the administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
But a prominent faculty physician who spoke highly of Quilligan called the 
resignation "a firing -- it was a power play." 
</P>
<P>
The physician, who also asked not to be named, said the lack of unified faculty 
support for Quilligan created a condition in which he could be fired without 
substantial backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"Quilligan got himself into difficulties, with the faculty of the medical 
school over the pay plan issue, and the administration with the hospital 
deficit," the doctor said. "He didn't have the full support of the faculty, and 
that provided the means for the chancellor and his other administrators to move 
in for the kill." 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen past and present medical school and medical center administrators 
were included in speculation about who might be named acting dean. Dr. Stanley 
van den Noort, who was dean for 12 years, said he is "absolutely not" a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short term, Dr. Quilligan's departure slows recruiting and other 
important activities," van den Noort said. "It would be better if (the 
resignation) didn't happen. It will require an acting dean while a search goes 
on -- maybe a year or two or three. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking ahead to somewhat unstable times for the College of Medicine and 
the Medical Center."

HOMELESS PROGRAMS NEED COORDINATION, GRAND JURY REPEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER and STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
An Orange County Grand Jury report released Thursday criticized the county for 
not coordinating its homeless relief programs -- as the jury recommended 2 
years ago -- and recommended that the government appoint a full-time homeless 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the number of homeless children is on the rise and 
called on school officials throughout the county to better track transient 
students who are not receiving a regular education because they move so 
frequently between jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Of the county's estimated 4,000 to 5,000 homeless people, a growing 
proportion, possibly one-third, are families with children," the report said. " 
. . . Compounding the problem is the lack of coordination of government 
agencies, as previously noted in a 1986-87 grand jury report." 
</P>
<P>
The report continued: "Cities and localities seem to be failing to provide 
services to the homeless for fear of becoming a magnet for street people. 
Perhaps for the same reason, the county tacitly supports the work of private 
service providers . . . but doesn't appropriate money from the general fund." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Leaman, director of the county's Social Services Agency, was not 
available Thursday. But one supervisor said the county already is at the limit 
of its funding ability to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth said, "I'm really concerned about the homeless. My heart 
goes out to them. But there isn't any money. That's the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about next year's budget maintaining the status quo," Roth said. 
"It's frustrating to me." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that he had not seen the grand jury's report but that he talked 
Thursday with Leaman about the homeless. Leaman "said we were at the capacity 
of doing the things we are financially able to do," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Some community activists involved with the homeless were critical of the grand 
jury's recommendations, although they qualified their comments because they had 
not seen the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to create more transitional housing, and if the grand jury report 
doesn't address that, they have missed a key element in this issue," said Scott 
Mather, chairman of the Orange County Homeless Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Grand juror Gilda Fehr said the committee did not recommend that the county 
build additional facilities for the homeless because it considered the cost 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have said build a building out there," Fehr said. But "we've got to 
think of reasonable recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
Mather called the jury's report "good, as far as it goes." But he added, "If we 
don't start looking at homelessness as a land-use issue rather than a social 
issue, we are never going to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
Also, both Mather and Jean Forbath, executive director of Share Our Selves, a 
Costa Mesa food and medical clinic for the poor and homeless, questioned the 
need for a homeless coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm worried about another layer getting in the way of directly dealing with 
the problem," Mather said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Forbath, "Creating a homeless czar or chief honcho is not a smart 
expenditure. I'd rather take that money and spend it directly on relief for the 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the grand jury's five-member Human Services Committee, 
listed eight recommendations. In addition to the housing coordinator and the 
tracking program for homeless students, the report recommended that: 
</P>
<P>
* Supervisors work with state Sen. Marian Bergeson's (R-Newport Beach) Homeless 
Task Force to assist in a study of the problem and cooperate in a 5-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
* The homeless coordinator develop a computerized referral system integrating 
county services with those of private providers, and that there be a toll-free 
phone number to provide information about available shelter space around the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
* The Social Services Agency establish more satellite offices, particularly in 
the fast-growing south county. 
</P>
<P>
* Supervisors order creation of a directory of services that is updated 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
* Supervisors assist private organizations with zoning approvals for converting 
vacant land -- such as parking lots or buildings -- into homeless shelters. 
</P>
<P>
* The supervisors support a proposal to use an existing trailer to bring health 
care and food services to the homeless in outlying areas.

WARMER TEMPERATURES FORECAST NEXT WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
CLOUDY BUT DRY WEATHER EXPECTED FOR WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High cloudiness and some patchy fog along the coast should be the worst the 
weather gets in Orange County through the weekend, forecasters said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although an approaching upper-level trough will deepen the marine layer and 
bring slightly cooler weather to Southern California today and Saturday, the 
National Weather Service said no rain is expected "at least through the first 
of next week." 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist Pat Cooper of WeatherData, which provides forecasts to The Times, 
said there is a "very slight chance of drizzle" today and Saturday, but she did 
not expect it to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how deep that marine layer gets," she said, adding that 
after Saturday, when onshore winds will give way to breezes coming from inland, 
"it should warm up just a little." 
</P>
<P>
Monday and Tuesday, she added, should be sunny and warmer, in Orange County as 
well as the rest of the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said Los Angeles' high temperatures should be in 
the low 60s today and in the upper 50s Saturday. Southland readings should 
range from 58 to 73 Sunday through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Los Angeles Civic Center high was 66 degrees after an overnight low 
of 43. The high relative humidity was 80%, and the low was 33%. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains and deserts will have the same high cloudiness, with high 
temperatures at the mountain resorts of 44 to 50 today and 36 to 46 Saturday. 
Maximum readings in the high deserts should be 58 to 66 today, 52 to 62 
Saturday. In the lower deserts, the highs will be 68 to 75 today and 64 to 70 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is expected to be 2 feet high along beaches in Santa Barbara, Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties and 3 feet along shorelines in Orange and San Diego 
Counties.

A 54-year-old Long Beach man driving on the Garden Grove Freeway apparently 
suffered a heart attack Thursday evening and ran off the road, California 
Highway Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorist died at Westminster Humana Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
He had been driving east approaching the San Diego Freeway when his car left 
the freeway at about 6 p.m., CHP dispatcher Joanne Losenno said. No one else 
was injured in the accident.

SOCKERS BANKING ON CROWD GROWTH AS SEASON PROCEEDS

<P>
For an idea of how the Sockers are doing on the field this season, all anyone 
needs to do is check the Major Indoor Soccer League standings once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
For an idea of how the Sockers are doing off the field -- and this year, that's 
more important than usual -- there isn't any such clear-cut, easy-to-read 
source. 
</P>
<P>
But in this most challenging season for indoor soccer's most artistically 
successful team, the former provides a clue about the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Put simply, management feels that it's about 14-13 right now . . . or slightly 
above .500. 
</P>
<P>
Management is Ron Fowler, the owner, and Ron Cady, the president. Attendance 
through 13 home dates is down to 7,721, from 9,067 at this point last year, but 
both men say they're upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for Socker fans -- although there are fewer of you than 
management was hoping -- because it means that despite some problems, soccer 
will probably be alive in San Diego for a while. 
</P>
<P>
Or will it? 
</P>
<P>
Owners are meeting in Dallas next week before the All-Star game, and the 
Sockers are planning to present the league with a fairly rosy report of how 
things are going. Of course, it is possible the other franchises will not be 
feeling as well. And Fowler has already said that there must be at least eight 
teams in the league next season -- one additional -- for him to go forward 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether there are eight teams or not is something we can only wait and see 
on," Fowler said. "It looks like there will be eight (Cleveland is almost 
certain to have a new franchise awarded), but we learned last summer that 
nothing is certain. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to concern ourselves with now is the future of the Sockers. 
And we're planning to have a future." 
</P>
<P>
But to have a prosperous future, there is going to have to be improvement. 
</P>
<P>
That's Fowler and Cady, sitting at midfield about 25 rows up, where they squirm 
each night when the attendance is announced early in the fourth quarter at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 6,326; 6,360; 6,820; 6,486. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, only four games drew fewer than 7,000 fans. Two years ago, only 
one drew fewer than 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
What's worse is that an attendance swoon is hardly something the Sockers can 
afford, figuratively or literally. When Fowler purchased the team in a federal 
bankruptcy court this past summer, he and Cady said the Sockers would need to 
average 10,000 fans per game to break even. 
</P>
<P>
As Fowler said at the time, he also had in his mind a worst-case scenario 
(fewer than 10,000) and a better-case scenario (more than 10,000). 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, what's happening now is a worst-case scenario," Fowler said. "But 
I'm encouraged since we are headed in the right direction. We started slowly 
because we purchased the team so late, and our team started slowly on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
"But things have picked up some (more than 8,000 fans at each of the past three 
weekend home games), and I think there's some indication that they will 
continue to improve. If we were where we are now, and we were headed in the 
wrong direction, I'd be very concerned about things. But I think we're on the 
way up." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, every time things seem to start looking better, the league is hurt 
by negative news. The latest was word this week that the Dallas Sidekicks were 
filing for Chapter 11 protection in a federal bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Tacoma Stars owner Jim Manza said his team needed more support, 
or it was going to be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing on the Dallas thing is unfortunate at best and horrendous at 
worst," Fowler said. "Next week is a very important week for us in terms of the 
owners talking about the league's future. It's too bad we have this negative 
news hanging over our heads. But, as always, we'll just have to keep trying to 
go forward." 
</P>
<P>
It really seems as if the Sockers are trying. But sometimes, all the trying in 
the world just won't make it. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the team commissioned San Diego State marketing department to do a 
study to find out just what the fans wanted. The study found that there just 
aren't that many fans. 
</P>
<P>
Cady said the study showed that only 10% of the population in San Diego County 
has ever attended a Socker game. That's a rather modest number considering the 
team has been in town for nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"That's good news and bad news, though," Cady said. "It's bad because it's such 
a low number, but it's good because it shows just how many people out there we 
still might be able to appeal to." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe some of them, Cady hopes, will buy season tickets and help the team reach 
its goal in that area. Before the season started, he said the Sockers hoped to 
gain 1,000 new season-ticket holders. 
</P>
<P>
Through the middle of February, Cady said, the team has sold about 85% of that 
goal. Not bad, except 1,000 season tickets was another of Cady's worst-case 
scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need to do is find a way to get people in here to see a game," 
Cady said. "And I'm talking about the people who have never seen one. If you 
take the 10% of the people in this county (approximately 200,000 people) who 
have been to a Socker game, it's not a bad number. But we need to make that 10% 
number higher." 
</P>
<P>
So, what to do? 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Sockers hired Holli Traeumer as their new director of public 
relations and promotions, with an accent on promotions. Traeumer has spent the 
past two months trying to get the word out. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately a half-dozen local radio stations have joined forces with the 
team to sponsor promotions and try to get the Sockers' name spread across the 
county. But the public isn't quickly buying into it. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that all the negative publicity surrounding the team and the 
league (this past summer) has put a negative idea in the public's mind," 
Traeumer said. "It's like people have jumped on the bandwagon (of MISL 
detractors). They think soccer isn't as good as it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, only time will change the public's opinion. Four teams folded over 
the summer, and the Sockers themselves nearly went under. It's understandable 
that people would think the product just isn't the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of our fans through the years also just expect us to be there at 
the end, or they were disappointed with our slow start," Cady said. "It is 
going to take time for them to realize that the indoor game is still alive in 
San Diego and that it is still exciting. In the meantime, we need to get some 
new people involved." 
</P>
<P>
Added Fowler: "We're behind where we want to be, but we're pointed in the right 
direction. If we can keep moving forward, we can make this thing work." 
</P>
<P>
A rosy statement. But you get the idea there are still some thorns to be dealt 
with.

TITANS' WINNING STREAK ENDS WHERE VICTORIES HAVE BEEN HARD TO GET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

LOGAN, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stirring three-game streak that had turned Cal State Fullerton fans 
absolutely giddy the past couple weeks came to a frozen standstill here 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Williams, the freshman point guard who had sparked the Titans to victory 
after victory, left the court without one of his trademark three-at-the-buzzer 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Matter of fact, he left the court without any three-pointers, missing six 
tries. And for the first time since Feb. 2, the Titans left the court without a 
victory, losing to Utah State, 90-80, in front of 8,340. 
</P>
<P>
This town has been a difficult place for Fullerton to play over the years, and 
for a few other teams as well. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans took the court at The Spectrum Thursday and started 
satisfactorily enough, with a nice turnaround basket by Derek Jones on the 
opening possession. 
</P>
<P>
That was about it. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State, pushing the ball up court against a lax and mistake-prone Titan 
defense, scored the next 17 points, taking a 15-point lead less than 7 minutes 
into the game and never particularly sweated it. 
</P>
<P>
That put Fullerton's losing streak in Logan at seven games. The Titans have not 
won here since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We buried ourselves," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Fullerton's three-game run with victories over UC Santa Barbara, 
Nevada Las Vegas and UC Irvine was done. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill, whose career-high 33 points was the only Fullerton effort worth 
commending, broke Fullerton's cold spell, knocking down a three-pointer. That 
was the first of nine points in a row for Hill, who got the Titans back in the 
neighborhood. They managed to cut it to five points at 25-20, but Utah State 
scored the next seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State led by 11 at the half, and Fullerton didn't get within 10 points in 
the second half, until only 11 seconds remained, when Hill's school-record 
seventh three-pointer made it 88-80. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State, playing a fast-breaking, sharp-passing game, made 62% of its shots, 
hitting 38 of 61. 
</P>
<P>
That was accomplished with an assist from the Titans, who allowed 27 layups. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just not getting back on defense," Sneed said. "I think they put us in 
shock by getting us down like that. . . . But it wasn't just our transition 
defense, it was definitely our halfcourt defense, too." 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (10-13 overall, 8-6 in conference play) enjoyed an evening of ease. 
Every player on the roster scored in the first half, and five players finished 
in double figures, led by Reid Newey's 15 and Nathan Grant's 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We pushed the ball up the floor and made some excellent decisions," Utah State 
Coach Kohn Smith said. "We had a great inside-outside attack." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton fell to 11-11, 6-7. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a big game," Smith said. "The last three or four games, Fullerton has 
been as good as any team in the league. Now, we're two games up on them. That's 
good for us." 
</P>
<P>
Utah State had one major misfortune in the game, when freshman guard Albert 
Chappell injured his knee in the late going. A preliminary examination 
indicated that he has torn a ligament and will be out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Hill was clearly the leader for the Titans, making 12 of 21 shots, including 
seven of 11 three-pointers. Many of those three-pointers came as he tried to 
rally the Titans. He added two free throws in three attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates got me the ball in certain situations and that's why I was able 
to score so much," Hill said. Other Fullerton players had less success. 
</P>
<P>
Cedric Ceballos, who has been the Big West Conference's leading scorer, 
finished with 16 points on eight-of-17 shooting. Coupled with an 11-point game 
against Irvine, it marked the second game in a row he has been under his 
21-point average. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm in a slump," Ceballos said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, coming off a career-high 20-point performance against Irvine in which 
he was four-for-four from three-point range, hit only three of 13 shots, and 
finished with eight points. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was the Aggies' night. 
</P>
<P>
"This has always been a tough place to play and it was no different this year," 
Sneed said. "They played with so much pop and snap tonight. They made crisp 
passes and set solid screens. They were as aggressive as I've seen them play 
this year. Unfortunately, it was against us." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hill: "It really hurt us to lose, but we can't let this game spoil the 
season for us." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Sneed's only company on the bench other than the players was trainer Jerry 
Lloyd. Assistant Coach Donny Daniels did not make the trip, but instead scouted 
high school players with an eye toward next year. . . . Fullerton's seven 
consecutive losses in Logan include a 96-95 double-overtime loss in 1987 and an 
82-76 overtime loss in 1986. The closest the Titans have come to a victory 
since 1982 was last season, when they lost, 75-72.

GREGORY PLANS TO MAKE TRABUCO HILLS' SWANWICK WORK FOR POINTS AGAINST SAVANNA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Gregory, Savanna High School basketball coach, has conceded as much before 
his team meets Trabuco Hills at 7:30 tonight in the second round of the 
Southern Section 3-A division basketball playoffs: Opposing center Rick 
Swanwick will score his share of points. 
</P>
<P>
Swanwick, 6-feet-10, averages 20.3 points and 13.5 rebounds per game. An 
estimated two dozen college coaches and scouts watched him score 23 points and 
grab 11 rebounds in Wednesday's opening-round 84-58 victory over Rancho 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna (23-2) will rely on 6-6, 220-pound center Tim Tillman and 6-8, 
210-pound reserve Eric Preuss to contain Swanwick, who is considered by many to 
be the top collegiate center prospect in Southern California who is still 
unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (18-6), which has won 13 of its past 14 games, uses Swanwick 
inside and sharp-shooting guards Tim Manning, Chad Poulos and Randy Kriech 
outside to keep opposing defenses honest. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna, seeded third in the division, is coming off a 91-point outburst 
against Azusa, the highest point production since the Rebels' 104-77 victory 
over Sunny Hills in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Mustaphi Abdi made his opening 11 shots and finished with 35 points, 
hitting 15 of 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A division games, all starting at 7:30: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills (16-9) at Corona del Mar (16-9): Laguna Hills is coming off its 
first playoff win in the school's history, a 72-67 victory over La Quinta. 
Guard Chris Sheff, a four-year starter, is the school's career scoring leader. 
Corona del Mar ended El Dorado's 14-game winning streak with a fine defensive 
effort in a 61-43 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (20-7) vs. San Dimas (18-6) at Charter Oak HS: San Dimas' tallest 
starter is 6-2 Chris Young, who averages 11 points and 5 rebounds per game. 
Junior Keith Walker, who scored 37 points in Brea's 29-point victory over La 
Sierra, figures to have another big game against smaller opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (20-5) at Norte Vista (15-10): Estancia guard Mike Curtis was limited 
to 10 points, his lowest output of the season, but the Eagles gained a 55-49 
victory over Foothill Wednesday. Estancia's reward? It gets to travel to 
Riverside. Norte Vista's top scorer is 6-2 forward Mario Nava, who averages 
23.1 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5-AA division: 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey (18-6) at Saddleback (24-1): Chaffey is making its first playoff 
appearance in 13 years. Saddleback, the county's top-ranked team, has won 19 
consecutive games behind the play of center Malru Dottin and guard Craig 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
L.B. Jordan (17-8) at Fountain Valley (19-6): Jordan was the only team to 
defeat fourth-seeded Lakewood in Moore League play and has also defeated Loyola 
and El Dorado. Guard Tom Weaver, despite playing with a sprained ankle, made 
two free throws with 16 seconds remaining to seal Fountain Valley's 82-76 
victory over Montebello.

PALOS VERDES OVERSHADOWS REST OF BOYS' 4-A FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes High School is the undisputed Goliath in the sparse field of 4-A 
boys' soccer teams that begin Southern Section playoffs today. 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County entries are among the 15 teams that will be hoping to upset 
top-seeded Palos Verdes (29-0). 
</P>
<P>
"They play at an incredible speed," Ocean View Coach Paul Kollar said of Palos 
Verdes. "It is lightning fast. They have exceptional athletes. Average athletes 
can't keep up with them." 
</P>
<P>
Kollar is happy his team is in the bottom half of the bracket while Palos 
Verdes is in the top half. But he is unhappy the Sea Hawks (14-7-4) drew the 
tournament's second-seeded team and must make a 2-hour drive. Ocean View, the 
third-place team in the Sunset League, plays at Simi Valley (22-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Sunset League's second-place team, Marina (15-6-4), is in almost the same 
predicament, playing at fourth-seeded Newbury Park (18-3-1) in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the pairings, both us and Marina, possibly the southern-most 
teams, are playing (teams in) the northern-most league, the Marmonte League," 
Kollar said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want it to sound like sour grapes, because we could have drawn Palos 
Verdes, and it would have been an hour instead of 2 hours, but you mean to tell 
me they couldn't have paired them up a little better?" 
</P>
<P>
Marina can play with the best the bracket has to offer. The Vikings tied 
Newbury Park, 0-0, in the South Torrance tournament this season and lost, 1-0, 
to second-seeded Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Edison, the Sunset League's top team, gets the home-field advantage in a 
first-round match against Rolling Hills (11-6-5), the Bay League's third-place 
team. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Angelus League champion Mater Dei (11-8) is it has a home 
match against Claremont (15-5-5). The bad news is a victory would match the 
Monarchs against Palos Verdes, assuming Westlake, a wild-card winner Wednesday, 
loses to Palos Verdes in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"Palos Verdes, when we see them, will be 30-0," Mater Dei Coach John O'Neil 
said. "If we get past the first two opponents, it's going to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Servite, the only other county participant in 4-A playoffs, lost its wild-card 
game, 3-2, to Upland Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County schools are well-represented in the Southern Section 2-A 
playoffs. Thirteen of the 29 teams in the main draw, including top-seeded 
Brea-Olinda and third-seeded Pacifica, are from the county. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Coach Manny Toledo always fields strong squads. The Wildcats were 2-A 
champions in 1986 and finalists in '87. Last season, as a wild-card entry, Brea 
advanced to the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
This season's squad might be Toledo's best. Brea (14-3-1) clinched its fifth 
Orange League title in six years and went through league play undefeated and 
untied for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively I have to say this is probably the most explosive team I have had 
since I have been at Brea the past eight years," Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Wildcats weren't tested in league play (they outscored opponents, 
34-6), Toledo said his team played a tough nonleague schedule and is peaking at 
the right time. 
</P>
<P>
Brea beat teams by a goal or two in the first round of league play, but in the 
second round the Wildcats outscored every opponent by at least three or four 
goals, Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
Brea has a first-round bye and plays the winner of today's game between La 
Quinta (10-7-3) and Ganesha (12-7-3). 
</P>
<P>
Brea is led by the Ochs brothers, Jaysn (18 goals) and J.R. (11 goals). Goalie 
Jeff Bettencourt has eight shutouts this season, two away from the school 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica (13-1-2) also drew a bye and takes on the winner of the Righetti 
(14-8)-Montebello (15-4-2) match. Eight county teams are paired against each 
other, so at least six (including Brea and Pacifica) will be in the second 
round of 16. Esperanza (12-3-2) has the best record of the rest, followed by 
Trabuco Hills (10-2-5) and Anaheim (11-4-3). El Dorado, Kennedy, Los Alamitos, 
Valencia, Woodbridge, Katella, Laguna Hills and La Quinta are the other county 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (15-3-3) is the top-seeded team in the small schools 
division, and is the only team in the 31-team draw with a first-round bye. The 
Heralds will play the winner of today's match between Webb (3-0-3) and Temecula 
Valley (12-9-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' 3-A division, No. 2 Mater Dei (12-4-2) will play host to Trabuco 
Hills (10-8-1) today. Mater Dei, an excellent midfield-control and defensive 
team, is led by goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga and midfielder Tina Manfre. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Agoura (19-0) has a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
Other 3-A matches involving county teams are: Foothill (6-7-2) at No. 3 Moreno 
Valley (14-2-1), San Gorgonio (15-4-4) at No. 5 La Habra (12-3-4), Redlands 
(14-8-4) at No. 6 Canyon (15-2-3), Fullerton (8-5-6) at No. 7 Orange (10-1-2), 
Sunny Hills (9-7-2) at No. 8 Pacifica (10-2-1), Rosary (8-5-2) at No. 9 Troy 
(10-2-2), Bishop Montgomery (9-9-2) at La Quinta (12-1-4), Kennedy (10-9-1) at 
Woodbridge (11-9-1) and Long Beach Poly (9-5-4) at El Modena (7-7-2).

16% OF PRIME SHARES TENDERED TO MAI ARE WITHDRAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A significant number of Prime Computer Inc. shareholders have withdrawn stock 
previously tendered to MAI Basic Four Inc. under its $970-million takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a Tustin-based computer maker, reported Thursday that 27.7 million Prime 
shares, or 61%, had been tendered under its $20-per-share offer, as of Feb. 15. 
That represents a 16% reduction from the 33 million shares tendered as of Jan. 
30, MAI said. 
</P>
<P>
MAI spokesman Peter Rosenthal attributed the decline in shares tendered to 
"unsubstantiated rumors" about a third-party bid. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's stock rose above the $20 bid 2 weeks ago on speculation that a "white 
knight" bid may be made for the Natick, Mass., minicomputer maker. Since then, 
however, the stock has dipped below $20. 
</P>
<P>
Prime's shares closed Thursday at $19.625, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Johnson, an analyst with the investment firm Rotan Mosle Inc. in 
Houston, said some takeover stock specialists known as arbitrageurs may have 
withdrawn their shares because of legal delays and other problems that are 
stalling the MAI bid. 
</P>
<P>
"The arbs are very time-sensitive and they want to be in on the latest hot 
deals," Johnson said. "This one is just taking too long." 
</P>
<P>
Prime has fended off MAI since the takeover bid was made in November, adopting 
"poison pill" defenses and waging court battles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in tendered shares, analysts said MAI still has the upper 
hand in the 3-month-old takeover struggle. 
</P>
<P>
MAI "still has a very substantial number of shares," said William Milton, an 
analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., a New York brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said Prime must soon find a white knight -- a company willing to 
acquire it on friendlier terms -- if it hopes to avoid an MAI takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MAI and Prime continue to wage their takeover battle in courts in 
Massachusetts and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge in Boston has continued an injunction barring MAI from 
proceeding with its offer, saying that he is not satisfied with financial 
disclosures made by MAI and its financial adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert. A 
hearing on MAI's appeal of the ruling has been scheduled for March 2. 
</P>
<P>
MAI is also challenging Prime's poison-pill anti-takeover plans in chancery 
court in Delaware, where Prime is incorporated. MAI has said it will not go 
forward with its plan unless the plans are invalidated. The Delaware court has 
delayed hearing MAI's appeal pending the outcome of the Massachusetts case. 
</P>
<P>
MAI has extended its offer to March 8.

MOST CONSTRUCTION STILL ON THE RISE IN ORANGE COUNTY, TWO REPORTS SAY 
</P>

Construction may be slowing down elsewhere, but not in Orange County. Two new 
reports show gains in 1988 in most types of construction in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The F.W. Dodge Group, a McGraw-Hill unit in New York that keeps track of 
building contracts, said contracts for construction of offices, stores, 
factories and other commercial buildings totaled $1.4 billion in Orange County 
last year, up 4% from $1.3 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Construction contracts for homes and apartments rose 8%, to $1.9 billion from 
$1.8 billion, although neither the commercial nor residential construction 
categories factors out the impact of inflation on these figures. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the number of building permits issued by local governments for 
single-family homes rose 22.6% last year, from 9,368 in 1987 to 11,486, says 
the Construction Industry Research Board in Burbank. But multifamily units -- 
condominiums and apartments -- dropped 22.6%, the board said, from 15,330 units 
in 1987 to 11,864 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, housing units were off 5.5% in the county last year due to the 
plunge in multifamily units, according to the research board, a sign that the 
housing inventory could get tighter and keep prices in some types of housing 
and in certain areas rising sharply.

HARTFORD INSURANCE TO CLOSE BREA OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The Hartford Insurance Group of Connecticut said Thursday that it plans to shut 
down clerical operations in Brea and Walnut Creek on May 26, and that 205 
workers at the two facilities must either transfer to Hartford operations in 
other states or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
About 65 employees at a Brea underwriting and service center and about 140 
employees at a Walnut Creek processing center will be affected, said Hartford 
spokesman Richard A. Bulat. 
</P>
<P>
The two offices will be shut down because of cost-cutting measures and the 
increased use of automation, Bulat said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a new federal law requires companies to give workers at least 60 days' 
notice of layoffs, Bulat said the Hartford employees were given 4 1/2 months' 
advance warning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been our policy to give as much notice as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Brea workers have the option of transfering to a regional office in 
Reno, and most Walnut Creek workers can transfer to an office in San Antonio, 
Tex., Bulat said. 
</P>
<P>
After the closures, Bulat said, Hartford will still have 1,200 employees in 
California at offices in Diamond Bar, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
The advance warning law went into effect Feb. 4. Called the Worker Adjustment 
and Retraining Notification Act, it requires 60 days' notice of most business 
shutdowns involving 50 or more full-time workers. Violators are subject to 
fines up to $30,000 and payment of up to 60 days' back wages and fringe 
benefits for affected workers.

TRACY SCHWARTZ SPENT A BUCK ON CAJUN MUSIC AND WAS HOOKED FOREVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California is not the most likely place to find a passkey into the 
world of traditional Cajun music, but life-changing discoveries often happen 
under unlikely circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Cajun music is rooted in rural Louisiana prairie towns that couldn't be more 
remote in setting or spirit from the hubbub of a metropolis or a music business 
center. But when Tracy Schwartz came through Los Angeles back in the early 
1960s as a member of the New Lost City Ramblers, an influential trio of folk 
music traditionalists, he had his first profound Cajun encounter. 
</P>
<P>
"At the old Ash Grove (the seminal L.A. folk and blues club), I got an album by 
(Cajun musician) Austin Pitre for a dollar," said Schwartz, who will play a 
solo show Saturday night at the Shade Tree in Laguna Niguel. "It was the best 
dollar I ever spent. It gave me a real good idea of what traditional Cajun 
music should sound like." 
</P>
<P>
For Schwartz, who grew up in New Jersey and Connecticut, that album was the 
start of a musical love affair from which he has emerged as one of the few 
players to have made a mark in Cajun music without having been born into the 
French-speaking Cajun culture. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound of the music was what got me first," Schwartz recalled in a recent 
phone interview from Fresno, where he had stopped during his annual West Coast 
tour. "The songs were in a language other than English, but there was a lot of 
country music in there, too. These two things that are almost contradictory 
were mixed in Cajun music, and that's what got me." 
</P>
<P>
For Schwartz, 50, those seeming incongruities held unusual interest: Country 
and Western was his first musical love, and foreign languages were another 
leading passion (he has studied five, including French and Russian, and he 
holds a bachelor's degree in German). 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz's next step on the road to being certified as an honorary Cajun (an 
award he received last year from the Louisiana-based Cajun-French Music Assn.) 
was encountering the music in the flesh at the 1964 Newport Folk Festival. The 
festival marked the first time that traditional Cajun music had ever been 
played on a prominent, mainstream stage. Schwartz struck up a friendship at the 
festival with Dewey Balfa, an expert fiddler who would become one of the most 
effective and engaging ambassadors of Cajun music and culture. He also became 
Schwartz's coach in things Cajun. 
</P>
<P>
"Tracy was like a child that sees a toy and he grabs for it and he can't reach 
it," Balfa said over the phone from his home in Basile, La., where he still 
drives a school bus when he isn't performing. But with enough patience, Balfa 
said, concluding the analogy, the child finally gets what he is reaching for. 
</P>
<P>
After a decade of running into Balfa on the folk festival circuit, Schwartz's 
involvement in Cajun music deepened in 1975, when, at Balfa's invitation, he 
visited Louisiana for the first time. Balfa wanted to record a Cajun fiddle 
instruction album modeled after the "Learn To Fiddle" instructional LP that 
Schwartz had released in 1965. He asked Schwartz to produce the record. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it back-porch style," recording at Balfa's home on equipment borrowed 
from the Smithsonian Institution, Schwartz said. Schwartz also took the tape 
machine out to area dance halls at Mardi Gras, where he captured Balfa and 
other local players for a second album. 
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, Schwartz said, he learned to appreciate the cultural attitudes 
that are an integral part of Cajun music. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a joie de vivre," Schwartz said. "It becomes important (for Cajuns) to 
go out on a Saturday night after a week of work, get out there and have a good 
time and let loose and have that as an integral part of your life style. It's 
kind of like being a child again in a way. It's good, and cathartic, and a lot 
of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz and his son, Peter, who also studied under Balfa, have gone on to 
support Balfa on three albums since 1984. "Souvenirs" was a Grammy nominee in 
1986 for best traditional folk recording. 
</P>
<P>
Can Schwartz, who also has taught himself to play Cajun accordion, fiddle 
Cajun-style as well as the native-born experts? Balfa, noting that he himself 
can't play bluegrass as well as a native Kentuckian, said it is probably 
impossible for an outsider to completely master a traditional folk style. "But 
Tracy's close," he said. "Tracy devoted so much of his time and musical 
knowledge to play Cajun music. He does a good job. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (Cajun) people thought it was not a culture to be proud of," Balfa 
added. "Then to find someone who wants to come down and share in your culture, 
your ideas and your customs -- a lot of people appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz had a large stake in folk music before he spent that buck at the Ash 
Grove's record counter. As a student at Georgetown University, he had been 
caught up in the folk boom of the late 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"I blundered onto the underground bluegrass scene in Washington," Schwartz 
said. "I started going to the hootenannys they were having, and that's where I 
met the New Lost City Ramblers." 
</P>
<P>
The trio, formed in 1958, included Mike Seeger, half-brother of Pete Seeger, 
and was devoted to preserving old-time Appalachian folk styles. In 1962, after 
Schwartz had served a hitch in the Army, the Ramblers asked him to fill a slot 
opened by the departure of one of the original members. The group disbanded 
after Schwartz had been with it for 17 years. He said the three members still 
get together for several reunion concerts each year. As a solo act, the 
Vermont-based Schwartz alternates between Cajun and Appalachian folk styles. 
</P>
<P>
Schwartz, who tours about half the year, said his current goal is to make 
inroads with a new audience: people confined to nursing homes. Schwartz said 
that he has tried to make nursing-home managers aware that good, live music is 
available at a modest price, and he hopes to persuade corporations, especially 
pharmaceutical concerns, to provide funding to bring musicians into the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're selling them drugs and crutches. They could help with something for 
their spirit," said Schwartz, whose interest in the cause was spurred by 
personal experience with his mother and with one of his sons, a paraplegic who 
lives and works now in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional folk, "this music of feelings, of real life," as Schwartz puts it, 
is a medicine he wants to administer to nursing home patients wherever he 
travels. "You have a healing power when you play this music," he said. "It 
encourages them, it picks their spirits up. I can see that when I play." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Schwartz plays Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Shade Tree, 28062D Forbes Road, 
Laguna Niguel. Tickets: $10. Reservations are recommended due to limited 
seating. Information: (714) 364-5270.

Now you've heard everything. 
</P>
<P>
Motor-home magnate John Crean and his wife, Donna, are building themselves a 
2,000-square-foot home and a 40,000-square-foot guest house. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. The Creans of Corona del Mar are turning the good life upside 
down on their rural 3.7-acre Santa Ana Heights property. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 42,000 square feet of under-roof structures, only 1/20th will be used 
daily by the couple, said Crean on a recent tour of the monolith-in-progress. 
"We like small spaces. We make our own bed. Donna cooks for me. We don't want a 
lot of people coming in to mop and vacuum. We have our place in the main house 
and the rest of it's for entertaining friends and family." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the mansion, which friends and family have said should be dubbed 
"Crean Acres," got started with some entertaining last year. On a crisp January 
afternoon, the duo tossed a demolition bash attended by such diverse 
nears-and-dears as actor Buddy Ebsen, Orange County Supervisors Tom Riley and 
Don Roth, composer Ray Conniff, Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas 
Fuentes, Pilar Wayne and Worst Dressed List author Mr. Blackwell. The idea was 
to smash to smithereens -- via bricks and sledgehammers -- the house that 
existed on the tree-sprinkled grounds to make way for the mansion, due to open 
its towering front door this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Crean -- chairman of the board of Fleetwood Enterprises, a Fortune 500 
company that manufactures recreational vehicles -- would cringe if he thought 
you'd be offended by the following litany of his home's amenities (after all, 
they're being created for you, if you're lucky enough to be one of his pals): 
</P>
<P>
There's the gymnasium that will sit over the carriage house where an oak dance 
floor will be available for tap dance lessons (with hoofer Ebsen as teacher? 
"Could be, could be," Crean said, laughing); the sprawling swimming pool; the 
north-south exposure tennis court ("that exposure keeps sun out of the eyes," 
he said); the sprawling, bar-equipped, rooftop verandas; the 10 guest bedrooms, 
each with a bath and each independently temperature-controlled; the projection 
room with a lobby where hot dogs, popcorn and pop will be featured; the 
billiard and video game room; the library with a contiguous reading room, and 
the kiddie playground. 
</P>
<P>
As for the "apartment," as Crean calls it: "It's over here," he said, strolling 
to the left of the grand staircase into a 12- by 16-foot area he said was his 
and Donna's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Whaaaaaat? Out of acres of frolic space, a master bedroom no bigger than most 
mansions' coat closets? "When we were married 40 years ago, we lived in a 
one-bedroom apartment in Compton that only had a Murphy Bed, a bath and a 
kitchen," he said. "It was about 10 by 10 feet. This is our life style!" 
</P>
<P>
But this humbly sized boudoir will feature twin television sets and earphones, 
Crean said. "So Donna can watch what she wants to watch and so can I." And 
nearby: a small living room, kitchen with breakfast bar, two huge closets and 
his-and-her baths and studies. "See, instead of a big master bedroom we've got 
space we can use." 
</P>
<P>
Crean is keeping his lips sealed about cost. "I don't know what the price is," 
he said. "I just watch the bank account, and if we run out of money, we'll have 
to stop." 
</P>
<P>
If the property has any drawbacks, it might be the constant roar from the jets 
that leave nearby John Wayne Airport. But the noise doesn't seem to irritate 
Crean, who smiles as he watches the third one in a matter of minutes soar into 
a bright blue sky. "On a day when the Santa Ana winds are blowing, the landing 
planes have to come in this way and they're so low we can see the people in the 
windows," he said. And besides, the couple's bedroom doesn't have one outside 
wall, he added. "So we won't be able to hear a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Just how often will the mansion be used for entertaining? "Our friends, four 
kids and grandchildren will be over a lot. When we lived on our San Juan 
Capistrano ranch, we had friends over almost every day. We love having people 
around. The reason for the design of this place is we can have friends here 
three or four days and not even have to know they're here." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us to John Crean's philosophy of life: "I think, unless people do 
things together, life is just not much. Donna and I just sitting and looking at 
each other can get a little dull. We all need to come together to enjoy life." 
</P>
<P>
As for that next Crean bash in Santa Ana Heights, be prepared for an 
eye-popper. "When we opened our house in Beverly Hills, we had a 150-piece band 
march down Canon Drive, form up on the tennis court and give a concert," Crean 
said.

gymnasium, swimming pool, game room and library. CLIFF OTTO / Los Angeles Times

FOR SOME, LOVERS' HOLIDAY WAS SPENT LEARNING TO LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Howard is a tall, slender man with snow-white hair and a slight, warm smile. By 
his description, he is intelligent, creative -- a thinker. But one thing 
worries him. He isn't sure if he knows how to love. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a demanding, critical mother who was a teacher," the 66-year-old real 
estate developer said. "I could never please her." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my childhood," Howard told his five classmates, who also weren't 
sure they could love, "I have had a difficult time learning to love." 
</P>
<P>
Howard, his estranged wife Evelyn, 53, and two other couples who asked that 
their last names not be used, spent nearly 2 hours at a Valentine's Day 
workshop sponsored by Orange Coast College hoping to find an answer to the 
question: "Are you able to love?" 
</P>
<P>
"As much as I love me, that's as much love as I am able to put back into the 
world," lecturer Marti Monroe told the participants, who met at 7:30 p.m. in a 
Costa Mesa High School classroom. 
</P>
<P>
So, as she instructed, they made valentines for themselves and filled them with 
a list of the personal qualities they respected and admired about themselves -- 
the first step, she said, to loving themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I make it my job to go around and teach everyone how to love themselves," said 
the marriage, family and child counselor who also teaches graduate students in 
her field at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in red and wearing heart-shaped earrings and two matching heart 
pendants, Monroe said she was surprised that all of the students were coupled. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when the class turned out to be all couples; I expected a bunch 
of lonely people without valentines." 
</P>
<P>
But company doesn't always rule out loneliness. When asked how their partners 
could make them feel loved, one participant responded, "I'd just like (my love) 
to be accepted, and I'd like to get a little back." 
</P>
<P>
"We still do things together," said Evelyn, 53, explaining why she and her 
husband attended the workshop together despite their separation over what he 
described as "problems that weren't getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three men said that the lecture was their wives' idea but that they 
had come willingly. 
</P>
<P>
Offering a reason for his limited participation in the discussions about love, 
Mike, a 48-year-old sales manager, said, "It's a very hard subject to talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Neil, a 41-year-old attorney, agreed. He hadn't offered answers to Monroe's 
introspective questions about loving relationships because he didn't want to 
"make a fool of himself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The questions are so simple, and you think, 'There must be a right answer to 
this, and I don't know what it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reticence of her male counterparts, Mary, a 48-year-old housewife, 
gave a simple answer for why she and her husband had come to the workshop. 
"It's about loving and it's Valentine's Day, and I thought, 'What a great thing 
to do.' "

"California is choking on its own traffic," said Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), 
chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, in a recent letter to The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"While vehicles have multiplied on the state's roads and freeways, politicians 
in Washington and Sacramento and local governments everywhere have pontificated 
and whined and argued and studied everything concerning transportation," Katz 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come up with just about everything but specific, comprehensive 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Well then, maybe it's time that teen-agers offered their advice.

FOUR HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADING SQUADS ROOTING FOR A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP

<P>
By LYNDA KIM, Lynda Kim is a senior at Cypress High School, where she is the 
editor of the school newspaper, Centurion Scroll, the historian for student 
government, president of the physics and calculus clubs, vice president of the 
International Club and a member of the California Scholastic Federation.

Give me a W! Give me an I! Give me an N! Give me another N! Give me an E! Give 
me an R! Give me an S! What do they spell? 
</P>
<P>
 What they spell is the status of the varsity cheerleading squads from Cypress, 
Los Alamitos, Marina and Mater Dei high schools. They're all winners. 
</P>
<P>
These squads will represent California at the 10th annual National High School 
Cheerleading Championship in Orlando, Fla., Feb. 25 and 26. 
</P>
<P>
This competition, considered the nation's largest and most prestigious, is 
administered by the Universal Cheerleading Assn. and sponsored by the Personal 
Products Division of Johnson &amp; Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The four Orange County schools became eligible to compete in Orlando by placing 
among the top five at the Southern California regionals competition Dec. 11 at 
Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
In Orlando, there will be one preliminary round, and from it, the top 20 of 
more than 120 teams, will advance to the finals. The finals, to be held at Sea 
World, will be taped by ESPN and televised at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
The judging criteria will follow a 100-point system. Each performance will be 
scored in four areas: the fundamentals, which include motions, jumps and 
gymnastics; group techniques, such as synchronization, rhythm, foundation and 
spacing; overall effect, including the routine's difficulty, crowd appeal, 
visual effect and choreography; and practicality. 
</P>
<P>
Each team, composed of a maximum 16 people, is allowed 2 1/2 minutes to perform 
a routine that must include a cheer. Music is optional. 
</P>
<P>
"When you say 'cheerleading,' people think it's a bunch of girls jumping up and 
down at the sideline," said Judy Trujillo, Los Alamitos' adviser. "But it's 
much more than that. It's become a sport that incorporates gymnastics and 
dance." 
</P>
<P>
Girls are not the only ones involved in the splits, jumps and pyramids. Behind 
every successful cheerleader -- and often below, lifting her up -- is a stunt 
man, otherwise known as a guy cheerleader. In fact, of the four county schools 
competing in Orlando, only Cypress is in the all-girl division. The other three 
will compete in the co-ed category. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress Centurions finished first at the regionals, beating out 15 other 
teams. This all-girl squad has been coached for the last 5 years by Cris 
Stuart, who does all the choreography for the team. He described his team as 
"outgoing and always willing to try." 
</P>
<P>
The cheerleading adviser at Cypress is Rick Schlichting, who is also the 
school's activities director. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Leisha Berry, 17, the team's co-captain, credits the squad's success to 
a number of things. "We have a good coach and very good teamwork," she said. 
"Also, we take gymnastics lessons on our own time, so all of us tumble. We can 
all do back handsprings. Not many schools have that advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Added Stuart: "We just have amazing pyramids, and our stunts are creative and 
continuous. I think that we'll do really really well (at Orlando)." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to daily after-school practices, the squad has held various 
fund-raisers to earn part of the estimated $500 per person needed to travel and 
to compete in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fund-raising activities included doing a cheer for a disc jockey at 
KIIS-FM. The team also received a donation for cheering alongside the Laker 
Girls at the grand opening of a mini-market. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Cypress competition squad, including co-captains Shelley Poyner 
and Berry, are twins Gina and Tina Fulford, Laura Heaney, Jenny Hedrick, Alison 
Liming, Rachel Nowack, Shelley Steinert, Misti Strath, Carie Tingstad, Stacy 
Tolkin, Lori Uyeno and Vera Woodington. 
</P>
<P>
In the co-ed division, Los Alamitos and Mater Dei tied for first place at the 
regionals, and Marina finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo has been Los Alamitos' pep adviser for 7 years, and Rey Lozano is the 
team's coach and choreographer. The Griffins, who have participated in the 
national championships for the past 8 years, were crowned national champions in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the Olympics," Trujillo said. "It's a sport, and you only get one 
chance. For 2 1/2 minutes, you have to be perfect. One little tiny drop could 
end it for the whole team. 
</P>
<P>
"We have very good choreography (and) the strongest squad ever in terms of 
talent. We just want to do our best. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny how we (the team) are known all over the country for cheerleading. 
In this contest, Los Alamitos and Mater Dei have been the two major 
powerhouses." 
</P>
<P>
Said team captain Sarah Ann Libby, a 17-year-old senior: "We are a very 
experienced squad who really want to win. If we hit our routine perfectly, I 
think we have a chance of doing just that." 
</P>
<P>
The team is composed of seven stunt men and nine cheerleaders. They are: David 
Ahlstrom, Darin Anthony, Yvette Cisneros, Sharisa Cox, Tracey Delaney, Lance 
Jorgensen, Libby, Colleen May, Nida Nafarrete, Kirk Saylin, Denelle Slynn, 
Samara Smith, Tracy Tounzen, Scott Udoff, John Vreeland and Bill Walters. 
</P>
<P>
This year's competition marks Mater Dei's eighth visit to the finals. 
Furthermore, the Monarchs are the defending national champions for the second 
year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going out there almost a fresh team, but we're still thinking about how 
we want to defend our title," said Mater Dei's co-captain Cindy Herrera, a 
17-year-old senior. 
</P>
<P>
The guys' co-captain, Fred Oliveri, will not compete in Orlando due to an 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Marquez has been Mater Dei's head coach and choreographer for the past 10 
years. His assistant is Laura Detterich, and they are both former Mater Dei 
cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
With activities director John Merino as their adviser, the seven guys and nine 
girls who make up the Monarchs' competition squad practice after school 4 days 
a week and on Saturdays. They are also required to attend gymnastics workouts 
at the Irvine Gymnastics Center once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"The team's talent level and choreography got us where we are," Marquez said. 
"(The choreography) highlights what the kids can do, and at the same time it's 
clear and very original. That's what the judges are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been there (the national finals) for so long that we know what it takes 
to place. I want them to hit the routine; it only takes a little lack of 
concentration to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
The competing members, made up of mostly juniors and seniors, are Gregory 
Alvarez, Kim Dreher, Greg Guard, Rob Hartstein, Daphne Henn, Herrera, Matt 
Jankowski, Megan Kelly, Cindy Millsap, Sean Parsons, Matt Retoske, Jenny 
Schwary, Larry Signaigo, Marlene Solis, Sharon Stanowicz and Jennifer Tinker. 
</P>
<P>
As a newcomer to the co-ed competitions, the Marina Vikings of Huntington Beach 
have worked hard to get where they are now. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've had stunt men in the pep squad, so you imagine 
all the flak (from our peers) we had to put up with," said team captain Brian 
Ross, 17, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've done and will do very outstanding considering that this is our 
first year in the co-ed division. We've really come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
Marina's pep adviser is Jeniel Moon and the coaches are Mike Reynolds and Dan 
Sapp. 
</P>
<P>
Said Moon: "In the beginning of the year, we only had two guys who could do 
gymnastics, but now I think everyone on the team is taking gymnastics classes 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked hard and they deserve to go (to Orlando). We'd love to win the 
championship. Why go there for any other reason?" 
</P>
<P>
Ross said the coaches have a lot to do with the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd definitely say that our coaches and their encouragements got us where we 
are now," he said. "They stay after hours with us. They want us to win for 
ourselves, and I really don't think we could have come this far without them." 
</P>
<P>
Ross also credits teamwork for the Vikings' achievements. "Ben Besley, Rebecca 
Patch and I -- even though I don't want to sound egotistical, it's the truth -- 
are the motivators of the team. But basically, we are all really close 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
The Marina competition squad consists of eight stunt men and 11 cheerleaders 
(three members will be alternates in Orlando). They are Besley, Christina 
Brandt, Stacy Conley, Briana Davis, Megan Dolon, Beverly Frankiewicz, Tawyna 
Holconv, Jamie Holell, Ian Ikemori, Xanthipe Jordonides, Amy Newton, Karen 
Oshima, Kiham Pak, Patch, Tim Perlick, Ross, Greg Squires, Keith Toda and Kent 
Vela.

From the modest, 15-person wholesale offices of Yanmar Diesel Engine in 
Anaheim, to the sleek, national manufacturing headquarters of Ricoh Electronics 
Inc. in Tustin, the presence of Japanese companies in Orange County is a 
substantial one. 
</P>
<P>
According to a 1987 survey conducted by the Japan Business Assn. of Southern 
California*, 87,483 people in California worked for Japanese companies or their 
subsidiaries, making the Japanese bigger employers than the top five 
corporations in California. 
</P>
<P>
Three-fourths of these jobs were located in Southern California, according to 
the JBA survey, with the preponderance in the transportation equipment (autos, 
motorcycles, etc.), electronics/electric and banking industries. 
</P>
<P>
The following list, though not complete, shows the Japanese presence: more than 
11,000 jobs and a cumulative annual payroll of nearly $200 million:

<TEXT>
<P>
A guard at Orange County Jail has been fired for failing to follow "procedures 
and policies" with the result that five inmates escaped Nov. 20, according to 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department. An investigation into the actions of 
five other guards continues. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Dick Olson declined to identify the deputy, who had been with the 
department since 1986. Olson also declined to specify the grounds for the 
guard's termination. His was the first investigation to be completed, Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All but one of the inmates who fled Nov. 20, 1988, have been caught. The 
inmates escaped by cutting a hole in a fence and lowering themselves from the 
roof of the four-story facility with a rope made of sheets. 
</P>
<P>
Still at large is Michael Taylor, who had been arrested for robbery. He was 
identified by a jewelry store owner in Chicago three weeks ago as the armed 
robber who made off with $450,000 in gold and diamonds.

Former baseball manager Leo Durocher was in serious but stable condition at 
Desert Hospital today after he was hurt in a traffic accident, authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Durocher, 83, was injured in a traffic accident here about 9 a.m. Wednesday 
when his 1989 Cadillac collided with another car at the intersection of Sunrise 
Way and Arenas Road, Palm Springs police Sgt. Joe Zingg said. Durocher injured 
his head in the accident, but "he was conscious at the time. He gave a 
statement," Zingg said. A nursing supervisor at the hospital declined to 
describe Durocher's injuries. No citations were issued. Durocher played a 
prominent role as a manager and player from the 1920s to the 1970s, earning the 
nickname "Leo the Lip" for his fiery umpire-baiting and scrappy style of play.

<P>
The body of a prominent Seal Beach real estate agent was found shot to death 
and stuffed into the trunk of her Mercedes-Benz in Long Beach, authorities said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Lee Chee, 46, was last seen alive leaving her Century 21 office at noon 
Wednesday for an appointment with another real estate agent, Detective Ron 
Pavek said. Her body was found about 9:50 p.m. Thursday in the trunk of her car 
parked in a residential neighborhood at 25th Street and Fashion Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Chee's husband reported her missing Thursday morning when she did not return 
home. About 30 family members and friends searched for Chee on Thursday before 
her brother spotted her Mercedes, Pavek said. 
</P>
<P>
Pavek said Chee had probably been shot sometime before Wednesday night. Her 
purse was missing, but detectives do not believe that robbery was a motive 
because her jewelry was found still on her.

INS CAN CONFINE REFUGEES TO SOUTH TEXAS, JUDGE SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge today ruled that the Immigration and Naturalization Service can 
reinstate a policy that confines refugees to South Texas while their 
applications for political asylum are considered. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by U.S. District Judge Filemon B. Vela denied an injunction sought 
by attorneys for refugees who sued the INS over the no-travel policy. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation was blamed for a backup of hundreds of homeless Central 
Americans at the southern tip of Texas. The judge Jan. 9 temporarily ordered 
the INS to allow refugees to travel to their intended U.S. destinations while 
he reviewed the request for a permanent lifting of the no-travel policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tent City Foreseen 
</P>
<P>
Many refugees then boarded buses for California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
A report Thursday indicated that Central American refugees may be detained in a 
South Texas tent city while their applications for political asylum are 
processed. U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) said the facility will meet basic 
human necessities of adequate housing, food and sanitary conditions. There will 
not be a fence. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that's going to create a multitude of problems here in the (Lower Rio 
Grande) valley," Mark Schneider, one of the attorneys who sued the INS over the 
matter, said after learning of the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys quickly appealed Vela's order. Attorney Linda Yanez said she 
filed the appeal in Brownsville and asked for an injunction against the INS 
pending that appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Case Backlogs 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Central Americans are expected to pour into the area this 
year, after crossing the Rio Grande illegally near Brownsville, the INS said. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials last spring reported a large increase in the number of Central 
Americans seeking political asylum in South Texas. The agency had stamped 
asylum-seekers documents and allowed them to travel to their declared U.S. 
destinations until Dec. 15 when, faced with huge case backlogs in cities such 
as Miami and Los Angeles, it started requiring people to pursue their cases in 
Harlingen. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of immigrants began camping in squalid conditions in makeshift tents 
and condemned buildings in the area, prompting a local public outcry.

The Iran-Contra trial of Oliver L. North has been set to begin Tuesday morning, 
officials at the U.S. Courthouse said today. 
</P>
<P>
Problems have been worked out over the use of classified material that North 
wants to introduce in his defense, and U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell is 
telling the jury to report at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, said the officials, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A jury of nine women and three men was chosen Feb. 9, the same day the Justice 
Department began trying to delay the trial. The department lifted its 
objections Wednesday after receiving assurances from independent counsel 
Lawrence E. Walsh, whose office is prosecuting North, that classified material 
would be protected.

The Bush Administration remains confident that the Senate will confirm former

his business and personal affairs, a spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no discussion whatsoever about any change in confidence in Sen. 
Tower's nomination or that he will be confirmed," said Deputy White House Press 
Secretary B. Jay Cooper. Meanwhile, the top Republican on the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia, said the panel has 
received additional material on Tower that it has forwarded to the White House.

The board of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra unanimously approved today an 
agreement between players and management to end a nearly 22-week strike -- the 
longest walkout in the history of major U.S. symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
The pact was announced after negotiators met for more than 12 hours in Gov. 
William Donald Schaefer's Baltimore office. While details of the contract were 
not released pending ratification by the 96 musicians on Saturday, both sides 
appeared satisfied with the four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Player negotiator Charles Underwood said by the third and fourth year of the 
pact, orchestra salaries will be "competitive" with comparable orchestras in 
other cities. The base average salary in the last contract was $700 weekly and 
the initial demand in the 1988 negotiations was for $1,000 by the last year of 
the new pact.

Guy Laroche, who abandoned dreams of a medical career to become one of the 
world's most popular fashion designers, died today at his home on the 
fashionable Right Bank following a long battle with intestinal cancer. He was 
67. 
</P>
<P>
The diminutive Laroche was awarded high fashion's Golden Thimble award for the 
best spring haute couture collection three weeks ago. It was the second time he 
had won the prize. 
</P>
<P>
Laroche, who was the favorite designer of screen star Audrey Hepburn and 
dressed the wives of French politicians, also gave his name to perfume, 
beginning with the fragrance Fidji. Among his other clients were Greek actress 
Melina Mercouri, Charlotte Ford, and former French First Lady Claude Pompidou. 
</P>
<P>
Daring innovation and eye-catching eccentricity were never his forte. 
</P>
<P>
"Guy Laroche dressed women, he didn't disguise them," one commentator said. 
</P>
<P>
Laroche went to New York in 1955 to study ready-to-wear techniques, earning his 
keep on Seventh Avenue as a free-lance designer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961 after returning to Paris, Laroche launched a ready-to-wear line, which 
soon earned renown among discriminating women as the most reasonably priced 
outfits sold by any big name French house. By the 1970s, the number of 
Laroche's boutiques swelled to 250 worldwide, including shops in New York, 
Dallas and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Laroche once said his dream was to dress actress Jacqueline Bisset. 
</P>
<P>
"She embodies what I like best and what I make best -- sexy ultra-feminine 
dresses which show the body to advantage."

TRADE DEFICIT DOWN IN '88 -- 1ST ANNUAL DECLINE SINCE CARTER

<P>
The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $137.34 billion in 1988, the first annual 
decline since 1980, as a surge in exports offset a relentless climb in imports, 
the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said exports shot up to an all-time high of $322.22 
billion last year, a dramatic 26.8% above the 1987 level, led by a boom in 
sales of U.S.-manufactured products and farm goods. The huge gain in exports 
was enough to offset an 8.3% increase in imports, which also rose to a record 
level of $459.56 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For December, the trade deficit shrank slightly to $11.9 billion, down from a 
revised November figure of $12.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
However, both November and December represented the highest imbalances between 
what the United States imported and what it sold abroad since August. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts are worried that the improvement in America's trading performance has 
stalled out. After improving dramatically in the first half of 1988, the 
deficit actually began to widen again toward the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Reversing that trend and getting further trade improvements is one of the major 
economic challenges facing the new Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Further Reduction 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the report, the Administration said it is committed to working for 
a further reduction in the trade deficit by boosting America's competitiveness 
on world markets and shrinking the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the decline "good news. It 
does show steady improvement, a trend of improvement." He said the trade 
deficit has dropped 22% on a year-to-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say the budget deficit has played a major role in the worsening 
trade performance of the 1980s by making America more dependent on foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said congressional approval of the Bush 
budget, along with a cut in the capital gains tax, would help to further reduce 
the trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Reducing the cost of capital, increasing personal saving and promoting 
research and development will go a long way to ensure that America wins at home 
and in the global marketplace," Mosbacher said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down 19.4% From Peak 
</P>
<P>
The $137.3-billion deficit for all of 1988 was down 19.4% from the all-time 
high of $170.3 billion set in 1987. It was the first year that the trade 
deficit has shown any improvement since it fell 12.5% to $31.4 billion in 1980, 
the last year of the Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
During the Reagan years, the deficit soared above the $100-billion mark as 
Americans' appetite for foreign goods proved insatiable. In 1985, then-Treasury 
Secretary James A. Baker III engineered a coordinated effort with major U.S. 
allies to devalue the dollar on foreign currency markets in an effort to make 
American goods more competitive and imports more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has proven successful in boosting exports but has had much less 
impact in curbing imports. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists believe that the dollar will have to fall further to see more 
improvements in trade. Other analysts, however, worry that steeper declines 
could scare off the foreign investors the United States has come to depend on 
to finance its borrowing needs and could run the risk of igniting a new 
inflationary spiral.

HUNGARY OPENS SCHOOL OF WESTERN-STYLE BANKING

<P>
Hungary today opened Eastern Europe's first school of Western-style banking, 
the latest sign of its determination to push toward a freer economy. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth told the opening ceremony of the school, a joint 
venture with a French organization, that what he called "distorted ideology" 
had taken Hungary away from the main lines of development in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We would now like to come back to the main road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's banking system must be re-evaluated and entrepreneurship should no 
longer be viewed with suspicion, Nemeth said, adding that he hoped the center 
would become a focus of banker training in Eastern Europe, and later Central 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
International Training Center for Bankers Ltd. is a joint venture of 28 
Hungarian financial groups and the Paris-based Center International de 
Formation de la Profession Bancaire. 
</P>
<P>
Representing the French partner, Jean Montgaillard said the Hungarian and 
French banking systems were part of the same family but had been "separated" 
for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have the feeling we are meeting again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The center is another step toward Hungary's desire to re-adopt a market economy 
with tools and instruments usually regarded as capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian, Italian and U.S. businessmen founded a business school in November 
to train Hungarians as Western-style managers. A stock exchange, suppressed 
after the Communist takeover 40 years ago, reopened in January.

COLD WEATHER FAILS TO CAUSE MAJOR DAMAGE TO ORCHARDS

The record-breaking cold apparently did less damage to San Joaquin Valley 
citrus orchards than had been expected, agricultural officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been disastrous and it's really too soon to tell for sure, but 
it doesn't look like it's going to be as bad as we first expected," said a 
spokesman in the Fresno County Agricultural Commissioner's Office. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that damage to the valley navel orange crop would be about 10% to 
15% from the four days of temperatures that dropped into the high teens in some 
valley areas last week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials credited efforts by growers to ward off the freezing temperatures in 
their orchards and the fact that the freeze happened in February for the lower 
than expected damage. 
</P>
<P>
Growers ran warm water through their orchards, burned fuel oil and dried peach 
pits and operated wind machines.

TOP JAPANESE BANKER BLAMES BUSH REVISED BUDGET PLAN FOR DOLLAR'S FALL

<P>
Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita today blamed President Bush's revised budget 
plan for the recent fall in the value of the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The government officials said Sumita told a morning Cabinet session he hopes 
the Bush Administration will implement measures to redress the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Market disappointment over the revised U.S. federal budget proposal is behind 
the recent fall in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen," 
Sumita was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Bush sent to Congress last week a revised $1.16-trillion budget highlighted by 
a one-year freeze in real growth of military spending and a cut in the capital 
gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
He said the federal deficit would be reduced to less than $91.1 billion next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Sumita said "stability of the U.S. economy is the basis of stable foreign 
exchange rates, and we hope the tempo of domestic demand expansion in the U.S. 
economy will slow down and measures to reduce the budget deficit will be 
implemented."

The hearing was held Thursday before arbitrator Richard Kasher. Arguing on 
behalf of the Padres was Tal Smith, who will be the Padres' acting general

Pitcher Pascual Perez of the Montreal Expos, who has had previous problems with 
substance abuse, has been in a drug rehabilitation center for the last two 
weeks, the National League team said today. Perez entered the center in Florida 
after meeting in his native Dominican Republic with David Dombrowski, the 
Expos' vice president of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The club said Perez had failed to comply with a strict after-care program 
prescribed by doctors because of previous drug-abuse problems. Perez, a 
right-hander, had a 12-8 won-lost record, with a 2.44 earned-run average in 188 
innings pitched last season.

Hall of Fame pitcher Vernon (Lefty) Gomez, who starred with the great New York 
Yankee teams of the 1930s, died today. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 80, died at Marin General Hospital of congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Born Vernon Louis Gomez in the small town of Rodeo, about 30 miles northeast of 
San Francisco, he was signed for $35,000 by the Yankees but went only 2-5 in 
1930, his first season in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
However, he quickly justified New York's confidence, going 21-9 in 1931 and 
24-7 in 1932, two of the four seasons in which he won more than 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
His overall record, including an 0-1 record with Washington in 1943, his final 
year in the major leagues, was 189-102. He had a 6-0 record in seven starts in 
five World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez won four of the five All-Star Games he started, including the first one 
ever played, in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drove in First Run 
</P>
<P>
Although that team included such legends as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Al Simmons 
and Joe Cronin, it was Gomez who drove in he first run. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing I did in baseball game me more satisfaction that getting that base 
hit," Gomez said a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After his career ended, Gomez spent some time managing in the minors, in 
Binghamton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is survived by his wife, June, daughters Gery, Vernona and Sharon and 
seven granchildren.
