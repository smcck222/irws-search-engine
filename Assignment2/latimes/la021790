AL MARTINEZ: IN THE CITY OF ANGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On any given day in L.A., several thousand people are sitting around trying to 
figure out a way to make everyone feel better. 
</P>
<P>
Not feeling better by looking better, although that too has become a kind of 
cottage industry in the City of Angles. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking fanny tucks and breast implants here. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking emotional health. We're talking smile, man, and hum a little 
tune, woman, though you might be overweight and flat-chested and, God knows, 
that nose could use some work. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking don't worry, be happy. 
</P>
<P>
What brings this to mind today is Friendpower, the latest means of 
simultaneously enhancing your feeling of self-worth while making a little money 
for the guy with your happiness at heart. 
</P>
<P>
Friendpower is the idea of Allan Colman, a former Fresno County administrative 
officer who has come south in an effort to crash L.A.'s booming feel-good 
market by taking us back to a better place in time. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't alone. I hear from feel-good people all the time from Bellflower to 
Malibu, and I generally give their efforts a try. 
</P>
<P>
I have squeezed sponges, floated freely, hallucinated and marched around the 
living room to mind-bending music in an effort to make myself feel better. 
</P>
<P>
Always, however, I am hounded by reality. The last effort I made to feel better 
ended with the 6 o'clock news telling me our milk cows take drugs and our oat 
bran health cookies are useless. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't trust milk and cookies, what's left? 
</P>
<P>
Allan Colman and Friendpower are left. 
</P>
<P>
What struck me first about Colman is that he is very clean. This may not seem 
important to you, but when you've been around as much scum as I have over the 
years, you come to appreciate a person who is well-scrubbed. 
</P>
<P>
Colman is so clean he glows. I like that. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I was impressed with the simplicity of his notion. All you've got to do 
is remember something good and it makes you feel a little better. 
</P>
<P>
He calls it a "self-guided reflective tour." It's a term applied in order to 
establish Friendpower's credibility. No one's going to pay to attend a 
self-help seminar advertised as Remembering Something Good. 
</P>
<P>
Colman is 48 and the holder of a doctorate in public administration from New 
York University. As Fresno's chief administrative officer from 1979 to 1983, he 
was responsible for 6,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he says, he was a typical boss. When someone had a problem he'd tell 
him, in effect, to shape up or ship out. As such, he was not unlike most 
employers who, with characteristic insight, would respond to a worker's stress 
by canning him. 
</P>
<P>
Then, however, he began to discover it was more productive to get his people to 
relax than it was to throw them out a window, an idea that continues to elude 
the mass of those on a supervisorial level. 
</P>
<P>
Colman discussed this with a psychiatrist friend who had been using the memory 
of pleasant events to alter current moods. Combining that with his own 
experience, Colman came up with Friendpower. 
</P>
<P>
He describes it as a series of techniques that will "bring a little fun back" 
from the past and put it in the future, using, among other memories, those of 
former friends. Hence, friend-power. Get it? 
</P>
<P>
The precise nature of those techniques are, of course, what you will pay to 
learn at his seminars. 
</P>
<P>
After my discussion with Colman, I decided to give my limited understanding of 
Friendpower a try by recalling pleasant events with pleasant people. 
</P>
<P>
Colman uses recollections of young love to relieve stress. He remembers his 
first boy-girl party, when they held hands and toasted marshmallows. Not at the 
same time, of course, but at the same party. 
</P>
<P>
I tried, but I don't think we bothered with marshmallows or hand-holding in 
East Oakland. All I can remember is Gloria Mack under the bleachers at 
Castlemont High. 
</P>
<P>
It was said that Gloria knew things about the human body they weren't even 
teaching in biology yet. She was far ahead of her time. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Mack isn't her real name, by the way. For all I know she may be teaching 
biology at Castlemont today. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, she used to hang around the bleachers after school waiting for 
football players to run by, like a moray eel looking for stray fish. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't play football, but I sauntered by one day and Gloria pounced. 
</P>
<P>
I fled in terror after she explained in some detail what she had in mind. I 
wasn't ready for all that. I don't think I ever have been. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking about Gloria put me in a cold sweat. Allan Colman was right in one 
sense. While I wasn't necessarily feeling any better, I sure wasn't worried 
about whatever came on the 6 o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
I can't even remember it.

Jim Purol's ambition is to sit in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In every seat. 
</P>
<P>
All 104,091 of them -- one after another. 
</P>
<P>
He estimates it would take him about 100 hours, including a 10-minute break 
every hour. 
</P>
<P>
Purol, a 38-year-old comic, wants to break the old mark he set -- or sat -- 
when he plopped down 101,701 times in Michigan Stadium (and went through four 
pairs of blue jeans). 
</P>
<P>
And he hopes to raise $40,000 for charity in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Pasadena isn't sure whether to let him attempt the giant sit-in. 
</P>
<P>
When he appeared before the city's Board of Directors (equivalent to a City 
Council), one member called his proposal "stupid." But the directors agreed to 
let him talk to Rose Bowl management, which wants security and liability 
guarantees as well as a detailed fund-raising plan before it will consider the 
stunt. 
</P>
<P>
Purol, who is searching for sponsors, says he's willing to comply. And he 
guarantees a professional performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I start at the top and go all the way around, row by row," he said. "I don't 
slide, either. I lift my butt off every (seat) number." 
</P>
<P>
Has all this talk of a new ethics law made local officeholders nervous? 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after reporters were ushered out of a press conference in 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's office Friday, a Times reporter discovered that 
she had left her tape recorder inside. And it was running. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to retrieve it, Yaroslavsky refused to release it, telling 
her in a joking, but firm manner: "Wait a minute! That's a good trick. I don't 
know what we said (after the reporters left)." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman then rewound the tape to the point where the conference ended 
and erased everything that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Then he handed the machine back, with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one that probably won't be condensed in Reader's Digest: The 36-page 
"Official Earthquake Preparedness Guide," which consists of one sentence 
repeated 36 times. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, a project of this dimension required two writers, Garrett Nelson and 
Eddie Braun of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
In this era when professional athletes sell their signatures, John Stallworth 
of Pico Rivera -- and not of the Pittsburgh Steelers -- saw an old-fashioned 
scene at the recent Greater L.A. Auto Show. One of the guest stars, Olympic 
swimming champ Mark Spitz, signed autographs for free -- and kept on signing 
when his scheduled three-hour stint was over because two dozen people were 
still in line. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than a month before the City of Industry's Great Snail Festival, but 
we're in for some big excitement before then: A destruction derby next Friday 
at the Indio Date Festival. This isn't just any destruction derby. 
</P>
<P>
"Making a special appearance," a festival press release says, "will be a 
12-foot high 'monster' tank that will crush cars like date pits." Let's hope 
they warn the drivers' pit crews.

THE GAP CONTINUES TO GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Bangladesh, a nation where the per capita income is $113 per year, men have 
a better chance of reaching age 65 than do black men in Harlem. The tiny 
country of monsoon rains has a gross national product of $16 billion, compared 
to the United States' $4.5 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 55% 
of Bangladesh's men reach age 65, compared to 40% of Harlem men. 
</P>
<P>
The study points out that, unfortunately, natural causes do not explain the 
difference in mortality rates. To account for the high death rate for Harlem's 
black men, the study cited drug dependency, illnesses resulting from alcohol 
abuse and homicide as the major causes. 
</P>
<P>
This study -- along with a recent article in Money magazine and previous 
articles in the black press about the cycle of economic discrimination -- all 
point to a sobering truth: In spite of the prominence of a handful of black 
celebrities who made it big during the 1980s, the quality-of-life gap between 
blacks and whites is frighteningly persistent and in many cases is widening. 
Even college-educated blacks earn significantly less than comparably educated 
whites and have only one-third the net worth of white professionals with the 
same earnings, the Money article pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
More studies and more evidence that the problem of racism in America won't go 
away and is in urgent need of attention.

IRAN HASN'T FORGOTTEN RUSHDIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Novelist Salman Rushdie marked the start of his second year in hiding from the 
death sentence pronounced upon him by Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
with a request, through intermediaries, for a dialogue with British Muslims to 
work things out. The answer came back quickly. The deputy director of London's 
Muslim Institute, noting that he spoke for "the whole community here," said the 
only acceptable resolution would be for Rushdie to be extradited to a Muslim 
country to face trial on an accusation of blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
What could Rushdie expect in such a case? "According to Islamic law, the 
punishment is death." The speaker of Iran's Parliament reaffirmed the 
authenticity of this view by announcing that the edict against Rushdie "remains 
in full force." 
</P>
<P>
And so Rushdie, born in India, now a British citizen and author of the novel 
"The Satanic Verses," which many Muslims consider insulting, must go on living 
his strange underground life, protected by armed policeman but isolated from 
every aspect of normal existence. The $1-million reward promised by Iran to 
anyone who kills him still stands. Rushdie's protest that he could not be 
guilty of blasphemy since he long ago gave up being a believing Muslim has been 
brushed aside. He is learning what victims of religious persecution have 
learned throughout history: What counts is not how he defines himself but how 
his tormentors define him. 
</P>
<P>
The world has witnessed much strange and odious behavior from Iran in the 11 
years since its Islamic Revolution. The open avowal of a right to terrorize a 
person for exercising free thought and free speech in a free society is only 
one notably bizarre example. Within Iran itself, of course, thousands have 
suffered barbaric torture and execution because clerical authorities accused 
them of heresy or insufficient piety. It is small consolation, but unlike these 
victims, Rushdie at least has some place where he can hide.

STILL NOT WET ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One weekend storm does not break a drought. Unless there are repeated waves of 
rain and snow in March and April, California faces a fourth consecutive dry 
year. The most recent rain and snow has helped the state water supply, but not 
much. Because the weather has been so dry, much of the new moisture has been 
absorbed into the soil rather than flowing off into reservoirs for storage and 
use during the hot months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the area served by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California is not expected to suffer severe shortages in 1990. But supplies 
certainly will be tight. The Met's buffer has been a surplus on the Colorado 
River, but this edge pretty much has evaporated because of dry conditions in 
the Rocky Mountain headwaters and because Arizona now is taking more of its 
share of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is suffering a double hit this year. The eastern Sierra snowpack is 
running only about half of normal. Thus, the spring runoff into the Los Angeles 
Aqueduct is expected to be well below the norm. And the city's draw on the Mono 
Lake Basin has been reduced because of environmental considerations. So what 
does Los Angeles do when its own supply is restricted? It exercises its senior 
status to call on more water from Metropolitan, spreading Met's supplies even 
thinner. 
</P>
<P>
But the greater Los Angeles area is far better off than much of the state. The 
federal Central Valley Project has notified its 20,000 farm customers that they 
may get only 50% of their normal water supplies this year. This would force 
farmers to either pump more ground water, at considerable cost, or forgo 
planting certain crops. One result is likely to be higher vegetable and fruit 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
California's Central Coast is particularly short of water, in part because it 
does not have an imported supply. Santa Barbara is moving into the second stage 
of a stringent conservation program, calling for reductions in water use of up 
to 25%. San Francisco Bay Area water agencies are dusting off their 
conservation and rationing plans from last year. San Diego has launched an 
unusual winter conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
Both Metropolitan and the state Department of Water Resources have undertaken 
innovative measures to increase water storage facilities to help customers get 
through future droughts. For this dry period, however, the only way to stretch 
supplies is for Californians to use water more prudently. Now is the time to 
begin saving with a vengeance.

A TEST THAT'S EASY TO FLUNK; 
</P>

IDEOLOGY: NOT MANY OF US COULD COUNT OURSELVES RESISTERS TO A TRULY HOSTILE 
REGIME. ACCOMMODATION IS THE RULE.

The young apparatchiks of the Soviet Communist Party are said to be having no 
trouble adjusting to the new political order. The day after the party's Central 
Committee renounced Communism's monopoly on power, students at Moscow's Higher 
Party School were already spouting the new dogma. 
</P>
<P>
The flexible ideologue is an ancient social type, dating back at least to 
England's famous Vicar of Bray, who became a Protestant or a Catholic depending 
on the whim of the monarch of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is law, I will maintain 
</P>
<P>
 Unto my dying day, sir 
</P>
<P>
 That whatsoever king shall reign 
</P>
<P>
 I will be the Vicar of Bray, sir! 
</P>
<P>
 The deft vicar kept his perks. But events moved too fast for some East German 
party hacks, who now find themselves in prison for the salamis of six months 
ago. But let's not be smug. These folks were just playing the game by the rules 
they were given, as most of us do. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it makes a pretty good parlor game. Which people in the Bush 
Administration would be members of the Politburo and which, if any, would be 
dissidents? The President himself, son of a senior regional apparatchik? James 
Baker? Can you see our secretary of state freezing in Siberia for his belief in 
freedom and democracy? Richard Darman? Robert Mosbacher? The Doles? Well, now 
that you mention it, I can sort of imagine Bob Dole warming his bile over a 
coal fire for a couple of decades in a gawd forsaken place with a name like 
Yukst because of some unfortunate remark to Stalin around 1949. But as for most 
of the rest, it's apparatchik city. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to suggest that the rest of us would be heroes. Even by Washington 
standards, the Bush crowd strikes me, at least, as especially characterized by 
ambition unhinged from principles of any sort, good or bad. But no doubt most 
of us would accommodate, not rebel. In his famous first speech as president of 
Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel said that everyone shared responsibility for the 
"contaminated moral atmosphere" the country inherited because, "We had all 
become used to the totalitarian system and accepted it as an unchangeable fact 
and thus helped to perpetuate it." This is stirring but overmodest, coming from 
a man who spent years in jail for opposing the system. Nevertheless, a 
corollary of its central truth is that those of us fortunate enough never to 
have been put to the test would have flunked it, too. 
</P>
<P>
I recently heard the following dialogue between an American left-wing 
intellectual and a reformed left-wing intellectual who is now a professional 
apostate, making a comfortable living as a disparager of his former views: 
</P>
<P>
Reformed Lefty: If people like you were in power, people like me would be in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Lefty: If people like me were in power, people like you would still be on our 
side. 
</P>
<P>
Lefty pretty clearly won that exchange. Some people's principles can't even 
survive a couple of presidential elections, let alone decades of totalitarian 
suppression. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that everyone except the occasional Vaclav Havel is corrupt, 
a bad person. Good people, even admirable, heroic people, can't always see 
moral scandals that seem blindingly obvious in hindsight. Thomas Jefferson 
owned slaves. Generations of enlightened men -- until just a couple of decades 
ago -- saw nothing wrong with a society where opportunities for women were 
circumscribed in ways that seem unbelievable today. Women still don't have 
equal opportunity, but almost no one denies that they're entitled to it. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush -- not an evil man, not a racist -- opposed the Civil Rights Act of 
1964. Today we argue about its interpretation, but outright opposition to the 
Civil Rights Act would put you on the distant fringes of political 
acceptability -- not in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
My point is not that America before the Civil Rights Act or the liberation of 
women was in any way comparable to the Soviet Union. My point is to reserve a 
bit of sympathy for people whose moral universe is suddenly turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
America's basic values are not going to be found wanting and rejected 
overnight, as is happening in the Communist bloc. But who knows what perceptual 
revolution will come along that will make the views of even right-thinking 
people today seem shockingly debased? When it happens, most of us will flip 
just like those students at the Moscow Higher Party School.

PROTEST DISRUPTS BUSH'S SPEECH

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mary Bent Wehrli, representing the Southern California Interfaith Task 
Force on Central America, Michael Breault, a Jesuit brother, and others stated, 
"You are killing children in El Salvador . . . You profess to be a man of God . 
. . You profess to be an Episcopalian . . . You killed my brothers," they 
proved that the truth can rise again: anywhere! 
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats in Congress are just as responsible for this shocking 
"policy" as Bush. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush is in a position to stop it now. He said, "Pretty tough," as the 
protesters were manhandled. Before the "tough" tolls for him, I submit: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies the body of President Blow

OIL SPILL OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How ironic the juxtaposition of the news can be. On Feb. 9 the big story, 
nearly filling the first section of the paper, is the 394,000 gallons of oil 
spilled off the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
A disaster that has all the politicians and conservation groups up in arms 
calling for new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
And then on Page 2 of Metro is a short little compilation put together by AQMD 
listing the 20 top releasers of hydrocarbons in the Air Quality Management 
District. The total annual release from just these few amounts to about 3.3 
million gallons or the equivalent of one spill the size of the one off 
Huntington Beach every 33 days! And because AQMD estimates that the majority of 
hydrocarbon release is from our autos, this is only a fraction of the oil spill 
that Southern Californians create everyday. 
</P>
<P>
These smaller, less dramatic spills end up in the same places as the big one, 
our air and water, and have greater effects on health and the environment. 
Certainly we should work to prevent major releases of hydrocarbons, yet at an 
accident rate of once every 20 years, the offshore spill pales in comparison to 
our everyday bad habits.

CBS SUSPENDS ANDY ROONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS was totally correct in its timely response to the remarks attributed to 
Rooney if for no other reason than to solidify its policy of condemning those 
who preach hate and promote bigotry without concern about the consequences or 
having to answer for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
Although I am African American and have had my share of prejudicial experiences 
resulting from the biased attitudes that are so prevalent in our society, I am 
unable to disagree entirely with the remarks by Rooney. Yet, realizing how 
deep-rooted the practices are to draw conclusions that all African American 
people fall into the category of school dropouts, pregnant, drug users, I have 
no choice but to consider such demeaning comments as insulting racial slurs and 
agree that CBS took the proper action and set an example that others need to 
follow.

<P>
I have known and admired Mary Brent Wehrli for many years, and have seen her 
transition from a comfortable middle-class life of caring wife and mother, 
including involvement in church and community activities, to that of an 
impassioned, committed Christian. At some point, she decided to cross the line 
between caring and total commitment, including the possibility of facing 
ostracism, indignity and even danger. How much we need to be aroused from our 
self-satisfied, self-serving complacency by those who remind us of a higher 
moral purpose.

OIL SPILL OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial regarding the oil spill off Huntington Beach misses the point 
entirely ("California Takes a Bad Spill," Feb. 9). 
</P>
<P>
As long as our engines of economic growth continue to be driven by fossil 
fuels, those fuels must be transported by tanker fleets. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, as long as tankers continue to traverse the oceans, there will 
inevitably be accidents and spills regardless of how "safe" any one particular 
ship may be built. 
</P>
<P>
If individuals and corporations are given no viable alternative to 
petroleum-based fuel products, society must accept the inherent risk that the 
transport of those fuel products presents. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the regulations, rules, standards or penalties proposed, it will 
happen again; maybe in five days, maybe in five years. Just don't cover your 
heads in the sand and pretend the problem will just go away. It won't.

OIL SPILL OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After having read the article "Tanker Spills Crude Oil Off Huntington Beach" 
(Feb. 8), I was both stunned and appalled at the stupidity involved in creating 
such a disaster which could easily have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
The drilling and transportation of crude oil should not be allowed in the 
coastal waters off of California. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, more adequate safety measures and a prepared cleanup team 
should be installed in case of such an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
As a surfer and recurrent lifeguard at Huntington Beach, I have a unique 
perspective of the ocean, both of its beauty and its savage energies. Knowing 
now that this beauty will be marred by black goop and messy cleanup crews 
greatly upsets me. The beach will be closed to both surfers and beach-goers 
alike for an indefinite amount of time while cleanup workers dispose of all 
this black poison. I doubt the beach will ever be the same for me again. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of foresight has caused irreparable damage to our environment time 
and time again. When will we learn? 
</P>
<P>
If all oil and gas exploration off our coastal waters is banned, this would be 
the first step forward in cleaning up the environment which is so necessary for 
our survival.

MORNING BRIEFING: TEAMMATES PIERCED BARKLEY'S DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Barkley, Mike Gminski and Rick Mahorn of the Philadelphia 76ers vowed 
that if the club won 10 consecutive games, they would get their left ears 
pierced. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers won 12 in a row before losing last week. Gminski and Mahorn kept 
their vows and began wearing diamond-studded earrings; Barkley, the instigator 
of the pact, held off. 
</P>
<P>
"I said when I was ready to do it, I'd do it," Barkley said. "We made a pact, 
and I'm going to stick to it. It's a permanent fixture." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley finally kept his word Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think once he saw Rick and I had done it, he finally succumbed to peer-group 
pressure," Gminski said. "He was, like, back there making the snowballs and we 
were throwing them, and so he had to finally step up to the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Feb. 17, 1954, who retired after 26 years as unbeaten world 
champion in court tennis? 
</P>
<P>
Thrill is gone: Mike Eruzione, whose goal lifted the U.S. team to a 4-3 upset 
victory over the Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics, on the political 
upheaval in the Eastern Bloc: "I'll be interested to see if the Eastern 
European hockey players maintain their attitude. Before, their only escape was 
to be a great athlete. Now their systems will be more like ours. I wonder if 
they'll lose that edge. For one thing, the rivalry isn't going to be the same. 
The Soviets aren't the bad guys any more." 
</P>
<P>
Add hockey: Bob McCammon, coach of the Vancouver Canucks, on 200-pound-plus 
Soviet left wing Vladimir Krutov: "His weight's down to its best level, but I 
swear he's going to miss a flight one of these days chasing a hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
Malpractice: Joe Fields, center for the New York Jets, on playing for Joe 
Walton, hired Friday as offensive coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers: "He 
inherited a healthy patient, a team that came within one game of the Super 
Bowl. All we needed was a little exploratory surgery to get better, but Joe cut 
everything up and killed the patient." 
</P>
<P>
Last things first: John Thompson, Georgetown basketball coach, on 
substitutions: "I have never felt it was a special honor to start. We are a 
team of finishers, not a team of starters. We give a lot more credence to who 
is in there at the end, not who is in there at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Take it up the middle: Jud Heathcote, Michigan State basketball coach, on 
George Perles being appointed to the dual role of Spartan football coach and 
athletic director: "I just know he'll come down here and advise me to run more 
than pass." 
</P>
<P>
Saying a mouthful: Lance Blanks of the University of Texas basketball team, 
denying he spit at a Texas Tech player: "(The other player) just took out his 
mouthpiece to say something and slobbered all over himself." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Pierre Etchebaster.

CLIPPERS FALL SHORT AT FINISH; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY MISS TWO EASY SHOTS NEAR END OF REGULATION AND LOSE TO 
BULLETS IN OVERTIME, 118-112. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After they wasted a 10-point halftime lead and then came back within a virtual 
lay-in and three-foot shot of victory, the Clippers could only shake their 
heads as they left the Sports Arena Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith could have won the game with three seconds left in regulation. 
Ken Norman could have won the game with a three-foot bank shot as the buzzer 
sounded. 
</P>
<P>
When the game went into overtime, Jeff Malone scored seven of his game-high 39 
points in the five-minute extra period, including three consecutive jumpers, to 
lift the Washington Bullets to a 118-112 victory before 11,105. 
</P>
<P>
"An inch here, an inch there," said Clipper Coach Don Casey, who went all but 
45 seconds of overtime without Smith, who fouled out. "Maybe we should get a 
leprechaun like at Boston Garden to ease those in." 
</P>
<P>
An inch anywhere and the Clippers are 22-27. Instead, they are 21-28, with 
another addition to a growing list of close losses. 
</P>
<P>
They never should have had to worry about such a notion. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets (19-33) overcame a 10-point halftime deficit to lead, 83-74, after 
three quarters, picking apart the Clipper defense that had troubled them a 
quarter earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Washington shot 60.9% in the third quarter and outscored the Clippers, 34-15, 
Bernard King getting 14 points and Malone 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers trailed, 100-91, with 4:36 remaining when the comeback started. 
They got six points from Norman and a free throw by Danny Manning to close 
within 100-98 with 2:54 left. Both teams scored again to set up the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had already been shut out on two consecutive possessions when 
Clipper Tom Garrick grabbed a loose ball under the basket. The Clippers had two 
full timeouts and a 20-second timeout to use, but opted for neither. 
</P>
<P>
They went to Manning at the free-throw line. A spin move and he was alone, a 
step into the lane to swish the shot and tie the score, 102-102. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets were denied again. When Benoit Benjamin rebounded Malone's missed 
jumper, one of 14 rebounds for Benjamin, the Clippers finally called a timeout, 
setting up the potential game-winning shot with 15.5 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
They ran the clock down to about three seconds before Smith twisted under the 
basket and missed a layup. The shot rolled along the rim and off. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was in," Smith said later. "It just missed." 
</P>
<P>
Washington's turn. The Bullets called back-to-back timeouts with one second 
left, and the Clippers used their 20-second timeout, only to have Ed Horton's 
inbounds pass from half-court sail untouched past King near the basket. The 
Clippers had another chance, and no time had expired. 
</P>
<P>
Norman got behind Charles Jones for a three-foot shot as the buzzer sounded, 
but put the ball up too hard. The ball went off the front of the rim, forcing 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was in," Norman said. "It was a great shot. We had two chances to 
win in the last five seconds or so. We ran great plays. We just didn't get the 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
With an offense that, at best, has been inconsistent and averaged 97.8 points 
the previous five games, the Clippers' plan was to force more turnovers. That, 
they figured, should translate into easy baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers executed their plan. Sparked by a 13-4 run midway through the 
second quarter, they took a 59-49 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which lost by six points Thursday night at Golden State, was ahead, 
38-36, with 6:56 to play in the half. Norman, who finished with 32 points, 
connected from the right baseline, Smith made the free throw when the Bullets 
were called for their second illegal defense, and the Clippers were up by a 
point. Then came the defense. 
</P>
<P>
Norman darted in front of King's pass at half-court and went in alone for a 
dunk. When the Bullets' Ledell Eackles penetrated inside the next time down, 
Benjamin swatted his shot out beyond the three-point circle. Norman grabbed the 
ball and raced to a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Next possession, similar result for Washington. Darrell Walker threw the ball 
out of bounds against the trap, and David Rivers converted that into a 
free-throw line jumper. Suddenly, the Clippers were ahead, 45-38, with 4:54 to 
play, en route to a 49-40 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Manning put the Clippers ahead, 57-49, with a dunk and free throw, and the 
Clippers provided full-court pressure when the Bullets took the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
It went to Walker, who was immediately surrounded by Norman and Joe Wolf. They 
knocked the ball loose, and Norman had only a few steps to go after picking the 
ball up for a layup at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Jim Les will be signed to his second 10-day contract, but not 
until Sunday. The one-day delay will allow the Clippers to get an extra game 
out of the extension before having to decide whether to sign Les for the rest 
of the season. Heading into play Friday night, he was averaging 11.5 minutes, 
1.5 points and 2.0 assists in three games with the Clippers. . . . Monday's 
game against Sacramento at the Sports Arena has a 3 p.m. start because of 
President's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers looked into the possibility of chartering an MGM Grand plane 
full-time but were unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts and 
refurbishing by the company. Besides, other than a five-game trip in early 
March, the Clipper travel schedule is light for the rest of the season. Team 
executives will, however, consider the possibility again during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Ainge isn't commenting on the record, but the Sacramento King guard has 
said he would welcome the opportunity to play for the Clippers. Any trade would 
have to come before Feb. 22. Ainge, whose leadership would be appreciated by 
the Clippers, reportedly is frustrated by Coach Dick Motta's structured 
offense.

<P>
My basketball team (9- and 10-year-old boys) recently had a game against an 
undermanned opponent. Five minutes into the game, when we led, 20-0, I benched 
our leading scorer, who had already scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Before the end of the first quarter, we discontinued our half-court trap. As 
the score mounted, we pulled our top two players and sat them on the bench for 
much of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
At halftime, the score was an abominable 45-3. We told the official scorer to 
keep track of the score but to turn off the scoreboard. He did so, and the 
other team, their parents and friends, happily never knew the final score. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension of Gil Ramirez, the South Torrance High girls' coach, who 
stopped a game when Morningside was leading at halftime, 102-24, demonstrates 
how perverse the thinking has become in athletics. What possible benefit could 
anyone have received from the continued public humiliation of the South 
Torrance team? 
</P>
<P>
Punitive administrative actions were necessary as a result of that game. 
Unfortunately, they missed the mark.

Mike Downey's column defending the South Torrance coach illustrates that he 
knows nothing about Ocean League girls' basketball. Morningside, a perennial 
girls' power, is stuck in the extremely weak conference. 
</P>
<P>
It's not its fault it has incredible talent such as Lisa Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside shows mercy all season, every season, against every ailing league 
opponent. This is the first time Coach Scott actually let his team loose in 
league play this season. They're going to the playoffs, Mike, and they have to 
practice going hard. 
</P>
<P>
It is truly pathetic when a hotshot columnist at the Times writes about a team 
he knows nothing about and probably hasn't even seen play, just because 
something big like this happens.

South Torrance Coach Gil Ramirez lost twice on Wednesday, Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
He obviously lost the game, but he also lost his senses. 
</P>
<P>
If the league is too tough for his school, forfeit the games before the season. 
To deprive Lisa Leslie a chance for a national record was not true

To encourage a player to "shine" once in a while, as Morningside Coach Frank 
Scott put it, is not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
To allow his team and one particular individual to completely demoralize an 
opponent is. And then Coach Scott has the gall to complain because the 
opponents, with only four players, refused to come out for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the old saying that you never kick a guy when he's down doesn't apply 
in this case, right Mr. Scott? After all, these weren't guys, they were high 
school girls. 
</P>
<P>
How foolish of me to think that a high school coach might also be responsible 
for molding character.

Didn't anyone ever tell Mike Downey that quitters never win? Winning is a great 
feeling, but we often learn the most about ourselves when things don't go our 
way. If a young person is taught to give up when he or she is losing, then what 
do they take away from that experience?

SABRES DEFEAT CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pierre Turgeon scored a goal and had three assists to help the Buffalo Sabres 
wipe out a 3-0 deficit with five goals in a row and beat the Montreal 
Canadiens, 5-3, Friday night at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon tied the score with his 27th goal of the season 1:16 into the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's Dave Andreychuk, who had missed seven games because of a knee injury, 
returned to the lineup and had a goal and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
Sabre Coach Rick Dudley said having the 6-foot-3 Andreychuk in the lineup makes 
"a huge difference." 
</P>
<P>
"He makes it a little easier on Pierre because they have to concentrate on both 
of them," Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens looked strong in building a 3-0 lead on goals by Guy Carbonneau, 
Mike McPhee and Mathieu Schneider before Buffalo exploited an inexperienced 
defense that was playing without last year's Norris Trophy winner, Chris 
Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios was sidelined because of a knee injury and without him in the lineup, 
the Sabres were able to force giveaways by the Montreal defense and camp in 
front of Canadiens' goalie Patrick Roy for easy tap-ins. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the first Buffalo goal by Doug Bodger, the Sabres scored 
from in close. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon's game-tying goal early in the third period was the longest shot of the 
bunch -- it came from about 15 feet out. Goals by Andreychuk, Dave Snuggerud 
and Benoit Hogue all came from barely outside the crease. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres ended a two-game losing streak, took a four-point lead over 
third-place Montreal in the Adams Division and won the season series against 
the Canadiens, 4-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Rangers 2, New Jersey 1 -- Bernie Nicholls set up power-play goals by Ulf 
Dahlen and John Ogrodnick and goalie John Vanbiesbrouck made 29 saves as the 
Rangers won at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the only Rangers' second in their last five games, but it 
stretched their overall streak to 9-4-3, moving them back into second place in 
the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey is 1-5-3 in its last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, Winnipeg 3 -- Mark Recchi's second goal of the game in the third 
period pulled the Penguins into a tie at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 9, Philadelphia 6 -- Steve Yzerman scored two goals and added four 
assists at Detroit as the Red Wings extended their unbeaten streak to four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 2, Edmonton 2 -- Doug Lidster scored early in the third period at 
Vancouver as the Canucks overcame a two-goal deficit to tie the Oilers.

MCGUIRE OPTS FOR UCLA OVER STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ryan McGuire of El Camino Real High, who helped lead an area team to the 
American Legion World Series title last summer, has orally committed to play 
baseball at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, a left-handed first baseman-pitcher, had narrowed his choices to 
Stanford and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire said he will sign a letter of intent April 11, the first day of the 
baseball signing period. 
</P>
<P>
McGuire, 6-foot-2, 185 pounds, said he was offered a partial scholarship from 
Stanford and a full scholarship from UCLA. The Bruins' 10-1 start made the 
decision easier. UCLA is ranked 15th by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt all along that the program would be on the rise," said McGuire, whose 
father, Ken, works in the UCLA athletic department. "The 10-1 start confirmed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Another big issue was that Stanford has so many great athletes that I probably 
wouldn't be able to break into the lineup for a couple of years. At UCLA, I 
should be able to play at first base and pitch some, even in my first year." 
</P>
<P>
After batting .397 at El Camino Real two seasons ago, McGuire was selected 
Cal-Hi Sports' sophomore Player of the Year. Last summer, McGuire played on the 
Woodland Hills West American Legion team, which became the first entry from 
Valley-based District 20 to win a World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
During the Legion regular season, district and area playoffs, McGuire batted 
.416 with five home runs and 30 runs batted in for West, which finished 38-7. 
He was was selected the most valuable player in the state tournament in 
Yountville, Calif., after hitting four home runs and driving in 12 runs.

HIGHLANDER GIVEAWAYS LEAD TO LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reminders of Osiris Nalls abounded Friday night at Granada Hills High, even if 
the Highlander guard was conspicuous by his absence. 
</P>
<P>
Nalls' name was taped to the back of Aaron Lattimore's warm-up jersey and the 
back of one of Ryan Cravens' shoes. Nalls' number 10 was clearly printed on 
Cravens' armband as well, and the Highlanders yelled Nalls' name as they broke 
the huddle to face Washington in a first-round City Section 4-A basketball 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
But the senior guard, who was suffering from chickenpox, was not where Granada 
Hills needed him most -- on the floor. The Highlanders could have used another 
ballhandler against Washington, which forced 19 second-half turnovers in an 
87-85 come-from-behind overtime win. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (17-9), which led comfortably at halftime, 50-33, wilted under 
Washington's intense full-court pressure in the second half. The Highlanders 
committed 11 turnovers in the third period alone, giving the ball away six of 
the first seven times down the floor, and finished with 29 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just very aggressive," Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson said of 
Washington. "I thought we were getting knocked all over the court, but the 
officials didn't see it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Washington (13-9) cut Granada Hills' lead to 66-63 after three periods, then 
tied the score for the first time, 68-68, with 6 minutes 55 seconds left in 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The Generals built an 82-76 lead with a little more than a minute to play, but 
Nalls' replacement, Sagy Koren (13 points, five rebounds) hit a jump shot and 
Lattimore (26 points, 19 rebounds) converted two free throws to cut the deficit 
to 82-80. A free throw by Isaac Burton (28 points) put Washington ahead by 
three, but Lattimore sank a three-point shot to force the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Washington took the lead in overtime, but Lattimore tied the score, 85-85, with 
a jump shot. Washington center Barnabas James, who led all scorers with 29 
points, scored inside to put the Generals ahead.

DAMEWORTH RUNS 4:13.1 IN TIMES GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bryan Dameworth lost a race for the first time in nearly a year, but it took a 
field full of Olympians to do it Friday in the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, an Agoura High senior, finished ninth in the men's Open Mile despite 
running a lifetime best of 4 minutes 13.1 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But that time was nearly 18 seconds slower than winner Peter Elliott. The 
two-time British Olympian ran 3:55.51 to beat Algerian Nourredine Morcelli, 
running for Riverside Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth's previous best was 4:14.4, run last summer at UCLA. He ran 4:14.52 
two weeks ago in winning a featured high school mile in Millrose Games at 
Madison Square Garden in New York City.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: 401(K) PLANS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE INSURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Can you please explain what happens to funds invested in a 401(k) 
program? Are these programs federally insured like a passbook savings account 
or are our savings at risk? Specifically, I want to know if a 401(k) is a sure 
thing and whether I can get all of my money back. I want the absolutely safest 
investment for my retirement savings. -- I. B. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The recent spate of failures of savings and loan institutions and the 
precarious position of some major insurance companies have unnerved many 
savers. It is not surprising that you should be concerned about your retirement 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
The 401(k) plans offered by many employers are simply a kind of pension fund 
supported by employers and their employees. And, as such, they are not covered 
by the type of federal insurance programs and guarantees available to deposits 
in banks and S&amp;Ls or investments in federal debt securities. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is still quite possible that your 401(k) savings are covered by 
federal insurance. Why? Because your 401(k) program may invest its proceeds in 
bonds issued by the federal government or in savings accounts or other insured 
investments. If so, then, to whatever extent that your particular account was 
invested in these insured instruments, you would be covered. 
</P>
<P>
You should ask your employee-benefits manager how your account is invested. 
Many employers offer their workers the opportunity of choosing for themselves 
how their account is handled. Some programs allow workers to invest in the 
stock market, mutual funds, government securities or even the company's own 
stock. By learning how your account is invested, you should be able to 
determine whether or not your savings are covered by any insurance.

Taking as Little as Possible From an IRA

Q: What is the latest possible date that I will have to start taking minimum 
distributions from my individual retirement account? I turned 70 on Jan 15. 
Also, what percentage of my account will I have to withdraw? I want to take out 
as little as I absolutely have to. -- V. S. 
</P>
<P>
A: The law requires that you begin taking minimum annual distributions from 
your IRA by April 1 of the year following that in which you turned age 70 1/2. 
For you, this means that you must take a distribution by March 31, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The minimum withdrawal is based on a variety of factors. These include your age 
at the time distributions begin, your life expectancy and how you decide to 
handle the third major criterion in the formula: the beneficiary of your IRA. 
You can elect to figure the life expectancy of your IRA on just your age or the 
combined ages of you and your beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
So, if your IRA beneficiary is substantially younger than you -- and you want 
to withdraw the least amount possible from your account -- you would be wise to 
calculate the distribution based on the combined life expectancies. Officials 
at whatever institution is handling your IRA can help you make the necessary 
calculations and provide you with the appropriate actuarial tables and paper 
work. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Loan to Son May Be a Second Trust Deed 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am planning on lending some money to my son. I would like to make the loan 
in the form of a second trust deed on his house so he can deduct the interest 
on his income taxes. Is this feasible? If so, what forms are required? Do I 
have to record them in the county recorder's office? -- B. G. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your plan is quite sound and you should have no trouble executing it, 
provided that the amount of your loan is within the limits of interest 
deductibility. Remember, under recent changes in tax law, your son can deduct 
interest on an additional home-equity loan of up to $100,000, provided that the 
total indebtedness on the house does not exceed its fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
Once this is settled, you can buy a standard second-trust-deed form at a 
stationery store that sells legal forms. Fill it out and have all parties to 
the loan to sign it. Although it's not required, you are probably better off 
recording the deed. The recording fee is minimal. Recording the deed makes it a 
public document that ensures your interests will be taken into account if 
additional loans are taken against the property or if the property is sold.

WITCHING HOUR SPOOKS MARKET; DOW FALLS 13.96

<P>
A late wave of computerized sell programs linked to expiring options dragged 
down stock prices Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 13.96 points to close at 2,635.59. For the 
week, the blue chip index fell 12.91 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported early in the morning that the nation's trade 
deficit shrank to $7.17 billion in December, its lowest level in five years, 
but that news was offset by a report that industrial production fell sharply in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the day, the stock market was slightly higher, but sell programs 
overwhelmed the frail advance in the last hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the selling was tied to the expiration of stock options and stock-index 
futures and options in what is known as a "double witching hour." 
</P>
<P>
On the broader market, advancing shares outpaced declines, 761 to 727, on Big 
Board volume of 166.8 million shares, compared to 174.6 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Technology stocks slumped Friday, with Hewlett-Packard falling 3 3/8 to 43 7/8 
after the firm reported disappointing first-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq fell 3 5/8 to 85 1/8 as several analysts cut earnings estimates after 
Compaq projected sluggish growth in the U.S. market. IBM fell 1/4 to 103 1/2 
despite favorable reaction to high-powered workstations introduced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bolar Pharmaceutical tumbled 4 7/8 to 8 1/8 after the Securities and Exchange 
Commission filed a complaint against the troubled drug company. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom dropped 3 1/4 to 29 1/2 on the over-the-counter market after the 
retailer said it expects earnings to fall in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Echo Bay Mines fell 2 1/4 to 16 5/8 after it told analysts that a previous 
estimate of recoverable gold was over-optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Agency Rent-A-Car jumped 2 1/4 to 12 in response to a published report that 
some investors believe the company may attract takeover interest. 
</P>
<P>
Castle &amp; Cooke rose 3 1/4 to 35 on the belief that the company's valuation 
would be enhanced by a spinoff of its Dole food unit. 
</P>
<P>
BankWorcester gained 2 7/8 to 18 3/8 after it agreed to be acquired by Citizens 
Financial for $22.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices closed mixed in moderate trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
Friday, reflecting investors' worries over Sunday's general election. The blue 
chip Nikkei average of 225 selected issues, which soared 316.10 points 
Thursday, eased 11.67 points to close the week at 37,460.32. 
</P>
<P>
Shares in London finished higher after a quiet session Friday. The Financial 
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 12.1 points, or 0.5%, at 
2,325.9.

Bonds Steady Ahead of Long Weekend 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished little changed Friday after a sluggish pre-holiday session 
and inconclusive evidence on the direction of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The closely watched 30-year Treasury issue fell 1/16 point, or about 60 cents 
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price declines, 
inched up to 8.46% from 8.45% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in the government bond markets ended several hours earlier than normal 
as traders got a head start on the three-day weekend that ends in Monday's 
observance of Presidents' Day. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.1875%, down from 8.375% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Falls Despite Good Trade Figures 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell Friday despite an encouraging report on the U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices moved higher, recouping their losses from the previous session. On 
the New York Commodity Exchange, gold rose $4.70 to close at $417.10 an ounce. 
Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $417.25 an ounce, up 
$4.25. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar opened on a strong note ahead of the government's merchandise trade 
report for December. 
</P>
<P>
While the figure was far better than expected, traders focused on the fact that 
imports were down 5.9%, which they interpreted as an indication that consumer 
spending is slackening. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.80 yen, up 0.35 yen from Thursday's close. 
In New York, the dollar closed at 143.90 yen, down from 144.85 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Against the West German mark, the dollar closed in New York at 1.6750 marks, 
down from 1.6940. The British pound closed in New York at $1.6972, up from 
Thursday's $1.6855. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Copper Futures Up on Supply Outlook 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures prices soared Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange amid 
positive economic signals and signs of dwindling supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, precious metals futures advanced; petroleum futures 
slipped; livestock and meat futures were mixed, and grains and soybeans 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
Copper futures settled unchanged to 4.35 cents higher with the contract for 
spot delivery up 4.35 cents at $1.1285 a pound and the more actively traded 
March contract up 4.3 cents at $1.1135 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Traders bid up prices going into the close despite the fact that the market 
will be closed Monday. Traders usually are cautious heading into a three-day 
weekend.

DIFFICULT DEBUT FOR LIBOR PESEK ON L.A. PODIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pity the poor guest conductor. 
</P>
<P>
He pops into town only a couple of days before his first performance, often as 
not a one-program stand. His mandate is to make beautiful music literally 
overnight, with clarity, precision and individuality. Never mind that time is 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
He is left pretty much to his own devices. Unless he happens to be a frequent 
visitor, he doesn't know his hosts, their city, its aesthetic perspectives and 
traditions. He cannot claim even a nodding acquaintance with the strengths and 
weaknesses of the orchestra, the acoustical quirks of the hall, or the 
proclivities of the audience. He may not even have met his soloist. 
</P>
<P>
He is unlikely to command automatic authority. Still, the options remain 
simple: sink or soar. 
</P>
<P>
Libor Pesek, who made his unheralded debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Thursday, certainly didn't sink. But he didn't 
exactly soar, either. 
</P>
<P>
He looks like a consummate professional, the sort of conductor one might be 
happy to procure from Central Casting. Handsome, grizzled, courtly and a 
respectable 56, he exudes Old World savoir-faire. 
</P>
<P>
He sculpts phrases meticulously in the air. He manicures graceful melodies. He 
provides the wonted technical cues and emotive clues, even though the strangers 
in front of him may not interpret the messages aptly. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences love him, we we told, at the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (where he 
serves as principal conductor). They love him in his native Prague (where he 
functions as conductor-in-residence). 
</P>
<P>
The audience applauded him politely in Los Angeles, where he made instant music 
politely. Having inherited a safe, generic program devoted to Mozart and 
Richard Strauss, he produced safe, generic, often superficial performances. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Pesek may harbor some really provocative ideas about the repertory at 
hand. On this difficult occasion, unfortunately, he had to be content with 
enlightened approximations. 
</P>
<P>
He opened the program, like many a Philharmonic maestro before him, with rough 
and unready Mozart, in this case the Symphony No. 32, K. 318. The roughness 
lingered -- timpani intonation turned out to be one of the more serious 
problems -- for Strauss' sometimes bright, sometimes bilious "Burleske." 
Emanuel Ax was the basically wild and often splashy soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Ax came right back for Mozart's A-major Piano Concerto, K. 488, playing with a 
curious combination of reckless, thumping bravado and nice, sentimental 
finesse. Pesek and the orchestra followed faithfully, scrambling the rhetoric 
only in moments of extreme agitation. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, they turned to the heroic sprawl and beguiling banality of 
Strauss' "Also sprach Zarathustra." Wisely, the conductor concentrated on 
keeping things moving. Here, the orchestra responded most appreciatively. 
</P>
<P>
It might be interesting to hear what Pesek can do with some of his presumed 
specialties. He is currently recording all the symphonies of Dvorak. No doubt, 
he could tell us a few things about the lesser-known Janacek repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps next time. . . .

SHANNON RECALLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unfortunately, in real life rock singer Del Shannon couldn't "Runaway" from his 
problems, which included periodic bouts of depression, alcoholism, perpetual 
lawsuits over his share of royalties, missed opportunities, loneliness, a 
broken first marriage and a lifelong inability to accept the cold and cruel 
fact that fame is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of his problems, Shannon remains a rock 'n' roll legend. 
</P>
<P>
He was not only a great singer with an impressive string of hits ("Runaway," 
"Hats Off to Larry," "Little Town Flirt," "Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the 
Sun)"), but one of the few early rockers to write his own material. 
</P>
<P>
His success in the early 1960s kept rock 'n' roll alive at a time when its 
popularity was beginning to wane. He will indeed be missed.

REMEMBERING GOLDBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even though it is a common denominator for all of us at some time, the death of 
Albert Goldberg and the rather touching "An Appreciation" by Martin Bernheimer 
(Feb. 6) started this day on a sad note for me. So much of what Bernheimer 
wrote about Goldberg brought back memories to me. 
</P>
<P>
On the few occasions at operas and recitals that I conversed with Albert, he 
struck me not only as the lucid, perceptive critic that he was, but as a 
consummate gentleman. The amenities, the social graces, were always there. 
</P>
<P>
I really only began to take note of opera in my student days, later studied 
voice and sang a bit, and it was in those days when the San Francisco Opera 
used to make annual visits to the Shrine Auditorium that I became an avid 
reader of Goldberg's opera reviews for The Times. There was always that 
eagerness and anticipation to get his "slant" on a production. It became 
ritualistic. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I spoke with the then emeritus critic was when I spied him at the 
last recital of the great diva Lily Pons in Palm Springs in 1973. His review 
read, ". . . Unmistakably Lily Pons!" Goldberg's writing through the years 
surely causes me to add, "Unmistakably Albert Goldberg!"

FACES . . . : IS THIS AMAZING OR WHAT?

Fishing for catfish and working in community theater -- that's what Arliss 
Howard was up to in 1983, just before he auditioned for the TV movie "The Day 
After." ABC Circle Films was shooting in Kansas City, Mo., and meeting with 
local talent there. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked in and said, 'How you doin?' " Howard remembers, 'I think they were 
taken with my manners, 'cause I'm really polite. . . . They said, 'Read this.' 
And I read it, and I didn't make any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Next thing you know, Howard was on the set in Los Angeles, hanging out with 
Jason Robards. 
</P>
<P>
Howard may still seem more Huck Finn than Hollywood, but in the new film "Men 
Don't Leave," he's paired with Hollywood leading lady Jessica Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Howard plays Charles, a musician-composer whose experimental music group 
includes such sound-makers as an egg-beater and a typewriter. Charles plays the 
accordion and, when the widow Beth Macauley (Lange) stumbles into his rehearsal 
bearing goodies from a chic eatery, he plays on her heart strings as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Jessica's great," says Howard about his leading lady. "She rehearses full 
blast. So when it came time to shoot, it was a breeze. Man, she hooks up. She 
really hooks up. We had a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Howard is known for his work in "Tequila Sunrise" and Stanley Kubrick's "Full 
Metal Jacket," in which he played Cowboy. Since he finished "Men Don't Leave," 
he's appeared at the Los Angeles Theater Center in "The Geography of Luck" and 
in the TV film "I Know My First Name Is Steven." 
</P>
<P>
Howard has no particular plans for the future, but he's not particularly 
worried either. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to do a job and, when you finish, you go off fishing . . . or you go to 
Europe. And, while you're there, you're like soaking it up. Soaking your life 
up. Everything's happening and you're just like, 'Wow, is this amazing or 
what?' " DEVON O'BRIEN

THE WASTELAND REVISITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Du Brow is an excellent addition to The Times television 
coverage/commentary. He brings a fresh perspective to Calendar, and he is an 
interesting read. 
</P>
<P>
I particularly liked his comments regarding TV news in his Feb. 10 column. I, 
too, have wondered just when we (as viewers) would begin to see some really 
in-depth discussion regarding the collapse of communism around the globe. The 
conservative/liberal debate on communism has dominated all the political 
differences we have in the United States. Most candidates have been judged upon 
their perception of this ideology and how they might cope with it. 
</P>
<P>
As Du Brow asked: "Who was closer to the truth about communism?" This is an 
important subject for debate, facts, detail. We need the benefit of serious 
consideration of these issues, and we need men of stature (as Du Brow wrote) 
from both liberal and conservative views to present them. It might help 
eliminate a repetition of past mistakes as we deal with what we hope are the 
remnants of this disastrous philosophy.

PUNK-ROCK HEAVEN FROM NORTHWEST'S NIRVANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his book "Lipstick Traces," semiotician Greil Marcus says something to the 
effect that any great punk song can sound like the best song you've heard 
before in your life. 
</P>
<P>
At Raji's on Thursday, Nirvana, a noisy power-trio from suburban Washington 
State, sounded for the moment at least like the best punk band you've heard in 
your life: deep-deep metal riffs repeated as relentlessly as beats on a hip-hop 
record, washes of guitar white noise, singer Kurdt Kobain bellowing punk koans 
above the din. 
</P>
<P>
Sample lyric: "I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative creep, I'm a negative 
creep. . . ." The bottom grabbed your guts in a way you may not have 
experienced since the Germs broke up. And some of the crowd was actually 
pogoing. 
</P>
<P>
Nirvana, the newest poster boys from Seattle's white-hot Sub Pop Records 
stable, are masters of that sort of anarchic hard-rock fullness you might 
associate with Jimi Hendrix. That's for half the set. The other half, 
neo-psychedelic ditties roughly structured like Seeds songs or something, seems 
thrown in the way the Kronos Quartet will toss in some Bartok or a nouvelle 
French chef will sometimes serve you a pot-au-feu, just to let you know that 
they can work in a classical vein if they want to. But Nirvana doesn't work as 
well as adenoidal teen heroes -- you can hear all the words, for one thing.

BLAKE BABIES' SWEET LOOKS AND TURBULENT TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This is a song about the benefits of shrapnel," singer Juliana Hatfield 
announced during the Blake Babies' show at Club Lingerie on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Emotional debris is what she was talking about. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston trio's turbulent little tunes are charged with incidents of 
betrayal, rejection, rage, conflict, spite, remorse. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not an unusual menu for an "alternative" rock band these days, but the Blake 
Babies (who also play Bogart's on Sunday) make it more memorable than most -- 
partly because of Hatfield's impelling, little-girl yowl, partly because they 
look way too young and sweet to have gotten into such messes. Playing to a 
thinned-out Lingerie audience following unrelated sets by L.A. roots-rockers 
James Intveld and Rosie Flores, the threesome looked as if they had burst into 
song while down in the dorm laundry room. 
</P>
<P>
Their minimalist rock moved along pretty briskly on Hatfield's bass and Freda 
Boner's drums, while John Strohm kept finding real hooks in his thick, grungy 
guitar work. The effect was one of sweetness trying to escape the muck. RICHARD

VINNEGAR WELCOMES FRIENDS IN INDIGO RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A number of musicians -- some of whom he invited to share the bandstand -- 
turned out for Leroy Vinnegar's homecoming Thursday night at Indigo Jazz Club 
in Compton. 
</P>
<P>
The three-night engagement marked the nimble-fingered bassist's first Los 
Angeles appearance since he moved to Portland, Ore., more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Before his move, Vinnegar had been a center post of support in the Los Angeles 
jazz scene for more than three decades. 
</P>
<P>
During the second and brief third set, the tall, broad man with a shock of 
graying hair -- whose instrument seemed almost diminutive against his girth -- 
played a brace of mainstream tunes that was highlighted by "Melody for Thelma," 
an enchanting, sinuous Blue Mitchell bossa nova. Here, pianist Bill Henderson 
swayed between slowly stated ideas that were filled with space and dashing 
note-dense structures that were delivered with disarming ease. 
</P>
<P>
On "Polka Dots and Moonbeams," where Henderson also offered a throaty soprano 
sax improvisation, and a Sam Jones blues, "The Chant," Vinnegar displayed his 
sweet, supple sound, which was a balancing point between Henderson and lithe 
drummer Tootie Heath and his as-ever rock-solid time. "The Chant" found the 
bassist soloing with fluid "walking" lines, as has long been his fashion, while 
on "Thelma" he opted for more horn-like stance to tell his story. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he invited singer David Whitfield up to the bandstand. Whitfield all but 
buried "My Funny Valentine" in vocal and physical histrionics. In the third 
set, saxman Teddy Edwards and pianist Dwight Dickerson cruised through "Four" 
and "Bag's Groove" with efficient musicianship, Edwards soloing with his 
inherent bluesiness and Dickerson adding a spark with his jaunty rhythms and 
neatly turned melodies. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnegar, with Edwards, Henderson and Heath in tow, closes tonight. ZAN STEWART

'ALVIN AILEY REMEMBERED' ON CHANNEL 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Going Home: Alvin Ailey Remembered" (tonight at 9 on KCET Channel 28) breaks 
all the rules for entertainment programming. Not merely another tribute to the 
choreographer who died Dec. 1, this hour-long telecast is essentially a 
transcription of the memorial service held for him at the Cathedral of Saint 
John the Divine. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ailey's grieving family, friends and colleagues, we look past his coffin 
at a ceremony intended (dancer Donna Wood explains) to send him on. "Great 
souls die and our reality, bound to them, takes leave of us," poet Maya Angelou 
reminds us from the pulpit. This is no ordinary performance. 
</P>
<P>
Ailey himself speaks to us from archival videotape. "I'm a choreographer," he 
says. "I'm a black man whose roots are in the sun and dirt of the South. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
An even younger, dancing Ailey appears in black-and-white 1962 footage, and 
these sequences -- along with brief, intimate interview segments with former 
Ailey dancers -- help broaden the Cathedral experience. Sometimes the words 
don't add up, but the ravaged faces are eloquent enough and director Andrew 
Clark Wilk captures them in haunting close-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Edited with great tact, the eulogies by New York City Mayor David Dinkins and 
others pass quickly, shifting the emphasis onto dancing by past and present 
members of the Ailey company. Dudley Williams takes "A Song for You" (from 
"Love Songs") into a new dimension, Wood is back in the exultant final section 
of "Cry," Mari Kajiwara returns to lend her radiance to "Revelations." 
</P>
<P>
The Ailey company has been accused in recent years of growing lackadaisical, 
mannered, hyperathletic -- but nearly everyone on this occasion is dancing out 
of deep emotion, connected to a sense of purpose often latent in these 
choreographies but here devastatingly intense. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, only singers and speakers are identified. In what seems to be a 
recent PBS mandate, dancer names are relegated to a mass listing in the final 
credits -- even when the dancers perform solos or duets. A program by the 
American Indian Dance Theatre recently suffered from this same policy and it 
will be instructive to see if PBS keeps the dancers of American Ballet Theatre 
equally anonymous. LEWIS SEGAL

RUMEX SCUTATUS, FRENCH SORREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perennial herb with tender leaves and clusters of small red flowers. 
</P>
<P>
French sorrel's complex sour flavor is the main component in a classic French 
soup and several sauces, and this alone is reason enough to grow it. Another: 
Sorrel is rarely if ever found on supermarket shelves, being quite perishable. 
And still another: It grows in Southern California with little water and less 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrel isn't the most beautiful herb in the garden; the rather plain, 
light-green leaves look like large arrowheads, offering no subtleties of 
coloration or shading. Sorrel just sits there, a pleasant mound that will 
eventually reach about two feet in height and in diameter. For gardeners in 
frost-free areas, sorrel is constant, providing the cook with abundant leaves 
throughout the year from the coolest winter to the hottest summer. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrel is related to a wild herb called wild sorrel (Rumex obtusifolius) or 
dock. The wild version has coarser leaves and a more bitter taste. The common 
culinary species, Rumex acetosa, requires a moist, semi-shaded location. French 
sorrel is the one that can take heat and drought. If you have tried 
unsuccessfully to grow sorrel from seed, you may have been sowing common sorrel 
seeds; many seed companies just sell "sorrel" without any qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have located the seeds, plant them indoors in potting soil or outdoors 
in the garden any time between now and the end of March. Don't let them dry out 
because they don't become drought-tolerant until maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to thin the plants when they start to crowd each other, and continue 
thinning until plants are at least 1 foot apart. Put transplants in the garden 
when they're about 3 inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you are addicted to cream of sorrel soup, you probably won't need more 
than two plants. But then, sorrel's leaves and flowers make a greenish-yellow 
dye, and one book claims that a strong infusion of these leaves will clean your 
linen, wicker and silver, although I have not tried this. Maybe you'll want 
several plants. 
</P>
<P>
* Taylor's Herb Gardens Inc., 1535 Lone Oak Road, Vista, Calif. 92084 
(catalogue $1) offers both acetosa and scutatus seeds; they also have French 
sorrel plants. 
</P>
<P>
* Nichols Garden Nursery, 1190 N. Pacific Highway, Albany, Ore. 97321 
(catalogue free) has the Rumex acetosa seeds that grow like scutatus. JUDITH

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS AND PLANTERS: GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
* Camellias are at their peak now . . . visit a garden center and look for the 
flower color you like best. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep an eye out for aphids on your roses and other ornamentals as the weather 
starts to warm up again. 
</P>
<P>
* Carnation lovers: Check out the new varieties to plant, and pinch back the 
ones already in your garden to encourage fuller plant growth. 
</P>
<P>
* Lawns just beginning to awaken from their winter's nap can use a meal of 
fertilizer to get them off to a good start. Healthy, thick lawns will have 
fewer weeds.

BOB GREENE: REQUIEM FOR AN ABSENTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guy spends entirely too much of his life on the road, and on this 
particular night he found himself waiting backstage in an ornate old theater, 
checking his watch every few minutes and tapping his right foot on the wooden 
floor, waiting to make his speech. 
</P>
<P>
He does this a lot -- flies into an unfamiliar town, makes a speech, then flies 
out in the morning -- and he has gotten the routine down pretty well. If it's 
an evening speech, like tonight's, he rests at the hotel in the afternoon, 
skips dinner to avoid a jumpy stomach, has some room service afterward and gets 
the first flight out the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the speeches are in stark convention centers or soulless meeting rooms; 
tonight the speech is scheduled for this grand old movie palace. If he had to 
guess, he would say that the movie house was built in the 1920s. Its ceiling is 
high, and there is intricate painting and detail work up near the balcony. He 
can peek between the heavy curtains and see the audience arriving; the movie 
palace has been refurbished -- repainted and re-upholstered -- so it is nearly 
as beautiful as when it was new. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost lost this place," someone had told him. During the '60s and '70s, 
the person had explained, the theater had been allowed to become decrepit. At 
the time, no one thought there would ever again be a need for a grand old 
downtown movie palace. Just when things looked the worst, though, a committee 
had been formed, money had been raised and the theater had been saved -- 
resurrected not for the display of new movies such as the ones in mall 
multiplexes, but for concerts and speeches and civic events. The theater once 
again was the architectural pride of the town. 
</P>
<P>
"The last movie they showed here before we knew we had to save the theater. . 
." the man from the town started to say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The guy who would be making the speech knew how the sentence was going to end. 
</P>
<P>
"The last movie they showed here before we knew we had to save the theater was 
'Deep Throat,' " the man from the town said. "That just seemed too sad." 
</P>
<P>
Which made sense. For some reason, it seems that every grand old movie palace 
in every American downtown had been reduced to "Deep Throat" before the civic 
leaders had decided to rescue it. The guy who would be making the speech 
thought that the saving of all the old movie palaces in all the old downtowns 
was a fine thing -- and this old theater was especially lovely. 
</P>
<P>
The guy wandered around the backstage area. There were ropes and sandbags and 
metal stairs, like remnants from vaudeville. And, back near the dressing rooms, 
there were photographs hanging on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
The photos -- autographed -- were from the performers who had appeared on this 
stage in the years since the theater had been saved. The guy looked at the 
glossies: Chuck Mangione, Bill Cosby, Charlie Daniels, Tammy Wynette, Itzhak 
Perlman, Eddie Rabbitt. The juxtaposition of some of the photos made him smile 
-- there was a photo of the Ohio Express, and there was a photo of the Vienna 
Choir Boys -- and some made him wonder. There was a photo of Bob Hope, for 
example. The guy thought: What inner drive, at this point in Bob Hope's life, 
keeps him on the road, brings him backstage to old movie palaces, perhaps makes 
him look at his watch in the moments before going on? 
</P>
<P>
All these people in the glossy photos -- they spend so much of their lives on 
the road, away from their homes and families, performing for strangers, then 
moving on to perform for more strangers the next night instead of sleeping in 
their own beds. There was once a haunting song written about this very thing, 
with a short but memorable refrain: "God bless the absentee." 
</P>
<P>
The guy overheard some people talking. They were students in the local high 
school's jazz orchestra, who would be providing music to open the program. One 
of the students, looking at the photos, said: "Is Dizzy Gillespie still alive?" 
Someone said, "I think he may be dead." And someone else: "No, he's alive. 
Count Basie is dead." 
</P>
<P>
The guy who would be making the speech stood in the wings. Out front, the 
audience was still arriving. A man named Fred Lewis was playing the old movie 
palace's "Mighty Wurlitzer" organ. Fred Lewis would play and then the jazz 
orchestra would play and then the guy would step in front of strangers and make 
his speech. God bless the absentee, he thought, looking at his watch one more 
time.

DAY HIKE: A MYSTICAL, MAGICAL AIR FILLS OJAI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY, John McKinney is the author of hiking books and a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ojai, nestled in a little valley backed by the Topatopa and Sulphur mountains, 
has meant tranquility to several generations of settlers and citrus growers, 
artists, musicians and mystics. In 1937, Ojai Valley was the setting for 
Shangri-La in the movie "Lost Horizon." 
</P>
<P>
The 10-mile-long, 3-mile-wide valley, surrounded by coastal mountain ranges, 
has always had a sequestered feeling. Chumash Indians named this region ojai, 
which means "nest." The meditative setting has spawned an artists colony, a 
music festival and a number of health resorts. The environment has also 
attracted the metaphysically minded -- hikers can look down on the Krotona 
Institute of Theosophy on one side of town and the Krishnamurti Foundation on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Ancient geologic forces shaped the Ojai Valley that modern-day visitors find so 
attractive. This part of Ventura County lies in a region geologists call the 
Transverse Range Province. Transverse means "lying across," and the mountains 
and valleys in these parts have been moved by seismic and other forces out of 
California's usual north-south orientation into an east-west configuration. 
</P>
<P>
This east-west positioning means lots of sunshine, with early morning light and 
long, lingering sunsets. Southern California locales with a southern exposure 
-- Ojai, Malibu, Santa Barbara -- often seem bathed in a magical light that is 
most bewitching. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Trail offers the best view of the town and valley. From the path, 
hikers get great views of the harmonious Spanish architecture of Ojai, 
sweet-smelling citrus groves and the sometimes misty, sometimes mystical Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the intersection of Highway 150 and Highway 33, 
head east on the latter route one mile to North Signal Street in downtown Ojai. 
The post office and the Oaks resort are on this corner. Turn north on North 
Signal and drive 3/4 mile to a junction with an unsigned road on your left. A 
large water tower and a chain-link fence are at this junction. Park along 
Signal. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: Take a look up North Signal, which ends in another 100 yards at its 
meeting with Shelf Road, the dirt fire road that will be your return route. Now 
turn west on the paved road below the water tank. The road soon turns to 
gravel, and you'll march past the Ventura County flood control works, the 
Stewart Canyon Debris Basin. Two hundred yards from the trailhead, just as your 
road turns north toward some residences, you'll spot a white pipe fence and a 
Forest Service trail sign. Join the trail, which soon dips into brushy Stewart 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The trail zigzags under oaks and a tangle of native and non-native shrubs. 
You'll cross two dirt roads then wind through a eucalyptus grove, which marks 
the site of the elegant Foothill Hotel, a casualty of fire just after the turn 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Trail turns north and ascends along the west wall of Stewart Canyon. 
The trail nears some private homes, crosses a paved road, then joins a dirt one 
and passes a water tank on your left. Shortly thereafter is a signed trail on 
your left for Foothill Trail 22W09 and Pratt Trail 23W09. Continue another 100 
yards on the dirt road to another signed junction with the Foothill Trail; this 
path you'll take east. Foothill Trail ascends fire-scarred slopes and runs over 
meadowland seasonally dotted with wildflowers. Keep an eye out for abundant 
poison oak. Just as you're beginning to wonder if this trail will ever deliver 
its promised views, it tops a rise and offers a first glimpse of Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The trail soon descends to an unsigned junction. A connector trail leads north 
to Forest Road 5N11; this road heads east to Gridley Road but offers no valley 
views. Stay with Foothill Trail, which descends to a little seasonal creek, 
then climbs eastward out onto open slopes for great views of Ojai. From some 
vantage points you can see almost the whole Ojai Valley -- Shangri-La indeed. 
</P>
<P>
About half a mile from Gridley Road, you'll spot dirt Shelf Road 200 yards or 
so below Foothill Trail. Experienced bushwhackers can blaze a trail down to the 
road, but think twice: It's probably more trouble than it's worth for the 
little time/distance saved. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Trail, near its end, descends more steeply, its route stabilized by 
railroad ties. The trail emerges at a crumbling asphalt road, which you'll 
follow 50 yards to Gridley Road. Turn right on Gridley Road. Walk 100 yards, 
cross a one-lane bridge, then descend another 100 yards to Shelf Road on your 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Shelf Road, closed to vehicle traffic by a white pipe gate, heads east and 
ascends moderately into the hills. Skirting orange trees and avocado groves, 
Shelf Road serves up views just a little less dramatic than those offered by 
the higher Foothill Trail. Just after the road bends south, you'll reach a gate 
and Signal Road, which you'll follow the short distance back to the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Trail: Stewart Canyon to Gridley Road; Return via Shelf Road; 5 1/2 
miles round trip; 600-foot elevation gain.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EMBATTLED COUNCILMAN WON'T SEEK REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Odell L. Snavely, a South Gate councilman who was placed on 
probation last month after pleading no contest to charges of contributing to 
the delinquency of two teen-age girls, has decided not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Snavely, 71, said he had decided at the start of his current four-year term 
that he would not seek reelection. His council seat, which he has occupied 
since 1979, is on the April 10 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a Municipal Court commissioner placed Snavely on two years' 
probation, fined him $500 and ordered him not to associate with children under 
14 unless other "responsible adults are present." 
</P>
<P>
Snavely was charged with harboring two teen-age girls at his toy store during 
school hours.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE RESIGNS ON EVE OF DISCIPLINARY 
HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who pleaded no contest last 
summer to a charge of driving under the influence of drugs has resigned on the 
eve of a disciplinary hearing before the Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Lopez, 57, who admitted to authorities that he smoked marijuana 
regularly, had been sentenced to 36 months of probation, ordered to enroll in a 
90-day drug treatment program and fined $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
Additional misdemeanor charges of being under the influence of cocaine and 
possession of marijuana were dismissed as part of a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Abby Soven has been assigned to handle the "fast track" 
caseload left by Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Judicial Performance, which meets early next month, now must 
decide whether to drop its case against Lopez, as it has done in other 
situations in which judges have resigned.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LOCAL FUND DRIVE BEGUN TO AID IRISH 
SEMINARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony said Friday that a $5-million fund-raising 
drive has been established to help restore and refurbish seven Irish seminaries 
where many priests in Los Angeles were educated. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said 170 Irish-born priests are serving in the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
"We in the archdiocese are most appreciative of the contribution made by the 
church in Ireland to the people of the Los Angeles Archdiocese," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The funds will benefit the All Hallows seminary in Dublin, St. Patrick's in 
Carlow, Maynooth and Thurles, St. Peter's in Wexford, St. John's in Waterford 
and St. Kiernan's in Kilkenny.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TENTATIVE DECISION MADE NOT TO PROSECUTE IN 
DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials in the district attorney's office in Pasadena have made a preliminary 
decision not to file criminal charges against five housing project security 
employees in connection with a struggle that led to the death of a 28-year-old 
man on project grounds last month. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Earl Holloway, a part-time employee of the Pasadena Parks and Recreation 
Department, died Jan. 18 after employees of Gold's Security Patrol chased him 
through the King's Villages housing project in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
He died after he was put in a neck hold during a struggle, the coroner's office 
has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Don Eastman, head deputy district attorney in Pasadena, said his office has 
tentatively rejected pressing assault charges against four of the employees and 
involuntary manslaughter charges against the fifth -- a dispatcher who 
allegedly administered the neck hold. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Eastman notified police of the decision. But after the dead man's 
mother urged him to continue investigating, he said he would examine the case 
again and issue a final decision on Tuesday.

ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL TOLD IT MIGHT LOSE MEDICARE FUNDING; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: COUNTY INVESTIGATION FINDS SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN QUALITY CONTROL AND 
EMERGENCY ROOM. $37-MILLION CUTOFF COULD CLOSE FACILITY. 
</P>

<P>
In a move that could jeopardize the future of one of the most prestigious 
hospitals in Los Angeles County, the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration 
on Friday threatened to cut off $37 million in Medicare funding from St. John's 
Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica over an incident last year in which 
the hospital turned away from its emergency room an elderly woman suffering 
from a brain injury. 
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered an investigation by the county Department of Health 
Services in December, which reported serious emergency room and quality control 
deficiencies at the Westside medical center. The results of the investigation 
were then forwarded to the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we have concluded that the hospital no longer meets the conditions 
of participation (for Medicare funding)," said Jerry Moskowitz, the Health Care 
Financing Administration's regional director. "The verification of that one 
incident by itself is certainly grounds for the termination of funding." 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz said the agency sent a letter Thursday night informing the hospital 
that it will shut off Medicare funds on March 6 unless the medical center can 
correct the problems by that date. The loss of Medicare funding could be a 
death blow to the facility, since more than 50% of its patients are insured by 
Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
Paulette Weir, a spokeswoman for St. John's, said hospital officials could not 
comment on the action until they receive the letter. She also declined to 
comment on the Department of Health Services report. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, an 85-year-old nursing home resident suffering from a 
brain injury, heart and respiratory problems was rushed by ambulance to St. 
John's on Oct. 19. A nurse at the hospital told ambulance attendants that they 
should take the woman to another hospital nearby. The nurse took the action 
"without first evaluating the patient to determine if an emergency medical 
condition existed," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"On arrival at the emergency department of the second hospital," the report 
stated, "a physician determined that the patient did have an emergency medical 
condition which made her unsafe for transport," especially since there was no 
paramedic traveling in the ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was treated and later transferred to another hospital and 
subsequently returned to the nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
A subsequent county investigation of the hospital found that St. John's had no 
quality control programs for reviewing prescriptions supplied in the emergency 
room, and had no plan for reviewing medical, surgical or nursing services 
provided there. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators also found poor documentation on 14 of 25 patient records 
surveyed, included a case where the hospital failed to report to authorities a 
suspected case of child abuse involving a 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1942 by the Sisters of Charity from Leavenworth, Kan., the 551-bed 
acute care hospital has long been considered one of the finest medical 
facilities in the county and has treated hundreds of Westside celebrities over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital, still operated by the Sisters of Charity, has about 2,200 
employees and 1,000 physicians. Recently, however, the hospital has struggled 
financially as a result of direct competition for patients with neighboring 
Santa Monica Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"For any hospital this large and with the portion of Medicare funding that it 
has, losing Medicare funding would be disastrous," said David Langness, a 
spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California..

POLICE UNION FIGHTS RANDOM DRUG TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest Los Angeles police union moved Friday to block a plan by Police 
Chief Daryl F. Gates to conduct random drug testing of sworn officers, setting 
the stage for a likely court fight as the LAPD tries to begin such testing by 
June 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Protective League filed an unfair labor practices 
complaint and formally notified LAPD officials that it is not willing to modify 
its contract with the city, which now allows very limited drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the purpose of having a contract?" asked Lt. George V. Aliano, 
president of the 7,800-member union. He called Gates' drug testing proposal "an 
attempt to reopen an issue already negotiated." 
</P>
<P>
But LAPD spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said the department will proceed with 
the plan to have a computer select personnel, from Gates on down, for drug 
testing each day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do it as soon as we can," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
In declaring his unwillingness to negotiate on the issue, and promising 
"appropriate legal action," Aliano said two-thirds of union members responding 
to a survey opposed any modification of their four-year contract "in the middle 
of its term." 
</P>
<P>
Under current policy, random drug testing is allowed only with officers in 
their first 18 months of employment. Special urine tests can be ordered for 
veteran officers only when there is some evidence of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
In November, however, Gates submitted a formal proposal to begin negotiations 
with the union to extend the random testing to all officers. Gates said 
citizens should have the assurance that the people who respond to emergencies 
are not on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, the LAPD's medical liaison staff would collect urine samples 
for testing in the department's lab. A positive reading would trigger a test by 
an independent lab -- whose confirmation of the finding would result in 
termination. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Gates announced his plan, Aliano had said he expected members of 
his union to support testing because "they want to show they are drug-free just 
like everybody else." But Aliano said the survey of members showed their 
apprehension on a variety of questions raised by Gates' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is reopening the contract," the union head said Friday. "That 
would be like us trying to reopen the contract with the city every six months 
to ask for higher salaries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He (Gates) said, 'You don't know what they (members) want. Well, I found out 
what they want. . . . I consider two-thirds a pretty good mandate." 
</P>
<P>
Aliano said the union is willing to "put everything back on the table in March, 
1992," when negotiations begin on a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of police departments around the country now do random drug 
testing of all officers. 
</P>
<P>
But Gates, who has long sought such a program, was encouraged by a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision late last year not to consider a union challenge to the Boston 
Police Department's 3-year-old drug testing policy. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a state labor law requirement that management "meet and confer" in 
good faith with a union before making significant changes in work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Protective League's official refusal "to meet and confer 
on the issue of drug testing" was included in a letter hand-delivered Friday to 
Parker Center police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said that, under LAPD officials' interpretation of court rulings, the 
department met its legal obligation merely "by extending an offer to meet and 
confer on the issue." 
</P>
<P>
"This response is 'no,' to decline that request," he added. "The offer and the 
request for a meeting is still there, as are the plans to proceed with the 
random testing. . . . We're going to go ahead, with an implementation date of 
no later than June 1." 
</P>
<P>
In its second action Friday, the police union filed a complaint with the city's 
Employee Relations Board. "This is the official way for me to say I'm not 
meeting and it's unfair for (Gates) to try to get me to that table," Aliano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, Cecil Marr, said the 
union also might seek arbitration to settle the question of whether expanded 
drug testing constitutes a reopening of the officers' contract. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't resolve this administratively by June 1, we'll have to go to 
court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The union's survey of officers asked six questions, including whether any drug 
testing should be done by the LAPD's Scientific Investigative Division or by an 
outside lab, whether officers who admit to a drug problem should be allowed to 
return to work after completing a rehabilitation program, and even whether any 
testing should look for traces of steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Aliano said he would not disclose the results of five of the six questions -- 
including the one seeking officers' general attitude toward random drug testing 
-- because of their potential use in future contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you reveal how your membership feels, the other side knows if you're weak 
or strong. I can't do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, the union said: "The decision to not reopen our 
contract in no way detracts from the sensitive nature of drug testing or the 
Los Angeles police officers' concern about the drug problem in this city and 
country. However, we are not part of that problem. . . . On this particular 
issue we must protect ourselves and our legitimate right to negotiate. . . ."

AUDIT FAULTS CRA ON MINORITY BUSINESS ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency overstated its participation in 
a city program designed to promote minority- and women-owned businesses, 
according to an audit released Friday by the city administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
The audit found that the redevelopment agency claimed credit for awarding more 
than $840,000 worth of work through the program last year to companies that 
actually did not fit the city's criteria. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the CRA statistics lumped in ineligible firms with 
those that are eligible for the city's Minority and Women Business Enterprise 
Program, initiated in 1983 in an attempt to increase the city's business with 
such companies. 
</P>
<P>
That practice, the audit concluded, "overstates reported progress in helping 
legitimate . . . firms get business with the city." 
</P>
<P>
The city requires companies to be 51% owned by minorities or women in order to 
participate in the Minority and Women Business Enterprise Program. But auditors 
found that CRA policy is to claim credit for participating in the program when 
the companies it hires are only 25% owned by women or minorities. Moreover, the 
report found that, in practice, the CRA gives itself credit even when the 
companies have less than 25% minority and women ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The audit was released several hours after Mayor Tom Bradley announced that he 
was ordering the creation of a centralized, independent city office that would 
"eliminate the inconsistencies" in the way city departments administer 
contracts under the program. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Fabiani, Bradley's chief of staff, said the mayor's announcement was not 
connected to the audit, which he said the mayor is still reviewing. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "ironically, what the mayor did today seems to go a long way 
toward solving the problems identified in the (city administrative officer's) 
report." 
</P>
<P>
The audit drew harsh criticism from Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who branded the 
CRA "a rogue agency" and called on Bradley to immediately order redevelopment 
officials to bring their policy in line with that of the city. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a travesty," Yaroslavsky declared. 
</P>
<P>
CRA officials, however, defended their policy and said there is no need to 
change it to conform to city guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy was developed five years before the city even had a policy," said 
Richard Benbow, the agency's deputy administrator for equal opportunity and 
contract services. "We're pioneers in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Benbow said that he believes the CRA's guidelines encourage white-owned firms 
to give minorities and women an equity ownership position. Moreover, he said, 
"the overwhelming amount" of contracts under the program are awarded to firms 
that comply even with the city's standards of women or minority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit, last year the CRA credited itself with awarding 24% of 
its contracts for public improvements, demolition and professional and 
technical services to firms with minority and women ownership, for a total of 
$3.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
But the actual percentage under city guidelines was 18%, or $2.7 million, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
The report noted that this figure is comparable to that of other large city 
departments. The Harbor Department, for example, reported 21% participation in 
the program, while the Department of Public Works reported 20%, as did the 
Department of Water and Power.

GANGS LEAVE GRAFFITI IN COURTHOUSE OFFICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When prosecutors arrived for work this week at the San Fernando Courthouse, 
where many violent gang members are brought to trial, they were startled to 
discover gang slogans and nicknames scrawled over the walls of the supposedly 
secure offices. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery Tuesday alarmed prosecuting attorneys and caused San Fernando 
Superior Court Judge John H. Majors to order all the outside locks changed. 
</P>
<P>
Majors also barred the courthouse maintenance crew from the building and 
notified Los Angeles County officials that he wants the company's contract 
terminated. He concluded the only way an outsider could have entered the locked 
offices is with the help of maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
"No one had access to these offices with the exception of the cleaning people," 
Majors said. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter added: "It makes a mockery out of the 
whole idea of a security system if, after hours, anybody can come in here and 
do anything they want." 
</P>
<P>
Gang slogans about the size of a hand were scrawled in black marking pen on 
walls, in the women's restroom and on a blackboard where the status of trials 
is listed. More markings were left on numerous pieces of paper inside the 
private office of a supervising attorney who assigns trials to other deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery prompted fears by judges and prosecutors that others could enter 
the courthouse after hours and plant bombs or hide guns for criminal 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an eerie feeling to walk in in the morning and see that," said Percy 
Ruffner, a legal assistant. "They were dropping little hints that they are 
here. It's scary to realize that you are not safe here." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison, who prosecutes gang members and has 15 
gang-related murder cases pending, at first said he feared someone might have 
tampered with his case files and identified witnesses. But the files turned out 
to be secure inside a locked cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance workers are the only people with unrestricted access to all the 
offices in the building, including prosecutors' offices and judges' chambers, 
Majors said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he believes some workers might have given copies of the keys to 
friends who are gang members, and he said he will find a new company to provide 
courthouse maintenance. He could not immediately fire the company, however, 
because it holds an extended contract with the county. But he said he had begun 
the process of replacing the firm. 
</P>
<P>
James Lee, owner of American Oriental Maintenance, whose workers have cleaned 
the San Fernando Courthouse for about three years, denied that any of his 
employees are gang members but conceded that they may have allowed friends into 
the building while they were working. 
</P>
<P>
He said his company will try to retain its contract to clean the courthouse and 
added that the same workers have cleaned the building for several years without 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Lee also contends that prosecutors have overreacted to what may have been 
nothing more than a prank. 
</P>
<P>
Nison, however, said the incident raises questions about how carefully private 
companies screen employees that have unrestricted access to the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the most frightening thing," he said. "They should realize they have to 
hire people who aren't going to compromise the security of the courthouse."

SULLIVAN'S UPBEAT FAREWELL ON 'THIS MORNING'

<P>
With an upbeat demeanor that matched her Disney World surroundings, but at 
times appearing near tears, Kathleen Sullivan bid viewers goodby Friday on her 
last day as co-anchor of "CBS This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Notified only the day before that Friday would be her last day on the job, 
Sullivan said that she was proud of her work and noted, "Yeah, I'm the one who 
wore the sweaters in the Olympics. I'm a bit older, but I'm also a bit wiser." 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Sullivan, who came to prominence in 1984 on ABC as the first 
woman to co-anchor the Olympics, is being replaced on the 7-9 a.m. weekday 
program by Paula Zahn, the former news anchor on ABC's "Good Morning America." 
Sullivan had been with the CBS show since it was launched in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Although CBS still has not made an official announcement, Zahn's agent, Richard 
Leibner, has confirmed that Zahn is going to CBS, and Zahn gave her farewell on 
"Good Morning America" Thursday. CBS is expected to announce Zahn's hiring on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faith Daniels will be the substitute host of "CBS This Morning" next 
week, with Zahn expected aboard the following week. 
</P>
<P>
The hold-up in the official announcement had been ABC's contractual right to 
make a counter-offer to CBS'. ABC is said not to have matched Zahn's new salary 
on CBS, estimated at $1.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan wished her successor well. "Paula Zahn has been the stepmother to two 
of my other children at ABC, and I'm sure she'll take great care of my third, 
'CBS This Morning,' " Sullivan said, in reference to the fact that Zahn had 
succeeded her as news anchor on "Good Morning America" and co-anchor of "ABC 
News This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
Although the ratings for "CBS This Morning" have improved recently, CBS is 
still in third place and, according to sources, decided to go after Zahn to try 
to move up further. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of what we've accomplished here in the last 2 1/2 years," Sullivan 
said. "We've restored the credibility that said we meant business in the 
morning here at CBS." Co-anchor Harry Smith praised Sullivan, thanking her for 
"being such a great friend and a great teacher." 
</P>
<P>
There was clapping in the background from Sullivan's colleagues, who were with 
her taping the show from the Disney World facilities in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's contract with CBS runs until November. She said she intended to take 
a break and hopes to do "some really wild and wonderful things." Network 
sources have said that she might go to work in the CBS sports division.

DEMONS: SUMMIT IN PASADENA DISCUSSES STRATEGIES FOR BREAKING THE HOLD OF EVIL

<P>
Under the militant banner of "spiritual warfare," growing numbers of 
evangelical and charismatic Christian leaders are preparing broad assaults on 
what they call the cosmic powers of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated with the notion that Satan commands a hierarchy of territorial 
demons, some mission agencies and big-church pastors are devising strategies 
for "breaking the strongholds" of those evil spirits alleged to be controlling 
cities and countries. 
</P>
<P>
Some proponents in the fledgling movement already maintain that focused prayer 
meetings have ended the curse of the Bermuda Triangle, led to the 1987 downfall 
in Oregon of free-love guru Baghwan Shree Rajneesh and, for the 1984 Summer 
Olympics in Los Angeles, produced a two-week drop in the crime rate, a friendly 
atmosphere and unclogged freeways. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the cinematic story line for a religious sequel to "Ghostbusters 
II," yet the developing scenario does have a fictional influence; interest in 
spiritual warfare has been heightened by two best-selling novels at Christian 
bookstores. "This Present Darkness," by Frank Peretti, describes the religious 
fight against "territorial spirits mobilized to dominate a small town." A 
second novel by Peretti has a similar premise. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller Seminary Prof. C. Peter Wagner, who has written extensively on the 
subject, led a "summit" meeting on cosmic-level spiritual warfare Monday in 
Pasadena with two dozen men and women, including a Texas couple heading a group 
called the "Generals of Intercession" and an Oregon man who conducts "spiritual 
warfare boot camps." 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, Wagner said: "The (Holy) Spirit is saying something to 
churches through these (Peretti) books even though they are fiction. People are 
reading these books that would never read our books." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to segments of Christianity that think of the devil as a biblical-era 
representation of evil not too credible or useful today, theologically 
conservative churches virtually assume that Satan is a real, active being in 
the world. Moreover, in Pentecostal and charismatic churches -- where speaking 
in tongues, healing and other supernatural "gifts of the Holy Spirit" are 
practiced -- some clergy conduct "deliverance ministries" in which they claim 
to exorcise personal demons. 
</P>
<P>
But clergy exploring high-level spiritual warfare point to the Letter to the 
Ephesians, among other biblical sources, for their marching orders against 
"world rulers of this present darkness." Some say they have discerned the names 
of the ruling princes. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, caution was expressed at the Pasadena meeting for several 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Ridicule from the outside world and by more moderate churchgoers is one 
concern. "I don't want to get so far out that they think I'm L. Ron Hubbard," 
said the Rev. Dick Bernal of San Jose, referring to the late science fiction 
writer and Scientology founder. 
</P>
<P>
"This is exciting," the pastor added. "But what's flaky, what's believable, 
what's scriptural?" Bernal's own literature, however, appears more confident -- 
suggesting that an evil prince over part of the United States "is a religious 
spirit who keeps people bound up in useless traditions" and giving directions 
for removing a curse on a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Another cause for caution, said Wagner, is the danger involved: "If you do not 
know what you are doing, and few . . . have the necessary expertise, Satan will 
eat you for breakfast." As a means of protection against the demonic while they 
met for eight hours Monday at Lake Avenue Congregational Church, organizers 
arranged for a comparable number of relatives and friends to pray continuously 
in a nearby room. 
</P>
<P>
A third concern, barely aired at the Pasadena conference, is whether other 
cultures are defamed with the suggestion that only evangelical Christianity is 
free of demonic influence. 
</P>
<P>
Demons were also blamed for the growth of New Age beliefs, the spread of 
illegal drugs, pornography "and the militant force of the Islamic movement" by 
Tom White of Corvallis, Ore., a conference participant who conducts what he 
calls spiritual warfare boot camps for local churches. 
</P>
<P>
One disagreement over strategy was apparent. White has questioned whether the 
Bible or the church today dictates a "holy crusade" seeking out evil presences. 
"We do not go looking for this level of battle, but we let it find us," he 
said. But John Dawson of Los Angeles, Southwest director for Youth With a 
Mission, recommends the offensive. "We need to overcome the enemy before we 
employ other methods of ministry among people," Dawson wrote in his book, 
"Taking Our Cities for God." 
</P>
<P>
God, it was suggested at the close of the meeting, endorsed the offensive 
strategy. Nearly all conferees laced their comments with something "that God 
told me," but Dawson's mother, Bible teacher Joy Dawson of Tujunga, said God 
had revealed seven principles to her at 4:30 a.m. that same day. The final 
point was the importance of being on the offense -- "not waiting for the enemy 
to attack," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The demon-fighting strategists in Pasadena included several who had taken part 
in a series of spiritual warfare workshops last July in Manila at a major 
gathering on world evangelization. The Pasadena meeting featured executives 
Samuel Kamaleson and John Robb of World Vision International in Monrovia as 
well as representatives of various evangelical mission agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Another conferee, Pastor Jack Hayford of the large Church on the Way in Van 
Nuys, told participants Monday that he has been interested since 1973 in 
"confrontation with the demonic." 
</P>
<P>
Hayford, a low-key Pentecostal preacher widely admired beyond his own Four 
Square Gospel denomination, is also the originator of the now quarterly "Love 
L.A." prayer meetings. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 pastors and church workers attended the fourth such prayer session 
Tuesday at Hollywood First Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
The stated purposes are merely to pray for each other and for solutions to the 
city's problems, but spokesmen acknowledged this week that "spiritual warfare" 
on behalf of Los Angeles is part of the reason for the three-hour meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Prayers were said Tuesday morning for the homeless, drug addicts and abused 
children and against abortion, pornography and other societal ills, according 
the Rev. Scott Bauer, an associate pastor at Church on the Way. "Demons were 
certainly mentioned," Bauer said, citing New Testament references. 
</P>
<P>
But Bauer and the host pastor for the prayer meetings, the Rev. Lloyd John 
Ogilvie, emphasized in separate interviews that the main purpose was to make an 
interracial, interdenominational show of mutual support. 
</P>
<P>
"The cliche, 'We need each other,' has lost its purely sentimental appeal and 
becomes a deeper, more profound reality," said the Rev. Donn Moomaw, pastor of 
Bel Air Presbyterian Church, in endorsing the prayer marathons. 
</P>
<P>
But the cosmic, darkness-fighting dimension of the meetings was cited by other 
clergy, including Bishop Charles E. Blake of the Church of God in Christ, 
Raymundo Diaz Jr. of Angelus Temple and Dennis N. Baker, general director of 
the Conservative Baptist Assn. of Southern California.

EX-SURGEON GENERAL CALLS FAITH HEALING THE 'MOST RANK FORM OF ARROGANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service

<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says faith healing is bunk. But the 
pediatric surgeon bases his diagnosis on his theological, not his medical, 
credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Koop's denunciation of faith healing is contained in his contribution to a 
new book, "The Agony of Deceit: What Some TV Preachers Are Really Teaching" 
(Moody Press). 
</P>
<P>
The book, a collection principally of articles by evangelicals accusing some 
television evangelists of heresy, was edited by Michael Horton, an Anaheim 
pastor and president of Christians United for Reformation. 
</P>
<P>
Koop attacked television evangelists who contend that sickness is a sign of sin 
and that those who are not healed lack enough faith. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to what many televangelists will tell you," he wrote, "there is no 
connection between specific sin and the judgment of God, in the sense of 
retributive justice." 
</P>
<P>
Koop based his criticism on his views as a "Bible-believing evangelical 
Christian" who believes that God worked miracles in biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
"When a faith healer commands God to perform a miracle, in the absence of a 
prayer that says 'Thy will be done,' " Koop said, "it is, so far as I am 
concerned, the most rank form of arrogance. If it were the sovereign will of 
God that humans be healed of all illness and all afflictions, all humans would 
be immortal. Isn't death, after all, the ultimate illness?"

SOME ANTI-SEMITISM TAKEN OUT OF PASSION PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BRIGGS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jewish high priests will no longer have horns, Judas will be a confused rather 
than a coldly mercenary figure and the temple merchants will no longer be among 
Jesus' persecutors in the 1990 Oberammergau Passion Play. 
</P>
<P>
But the half-million people who descend on the small German town in the 
Bavarian Alps for the account of Jesus' final days will still hear the passage 
from Matthew that has plagued Jews for 19 centuries: "His blood be on us and 
our children." 
</P>
<P>
American Jewish leaders who have been meeting with village officials since 1985 
to eliminate what they consider anti-Semitic images from the play applauded the 
changes but said they do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The retention of the 'blood curse' is very problematic," said Rabbi James 
Rudin, director of interreligious affairs for the American Jewish Committee in 
New York. "My dream was, my hope was, there would be a new play." 
</P>
<P>
But one of the play's directors said the revisions, plus three votes and long 
discussions within the village about whether to keep the passage from Matthew 
27:25 show that Oberammergau is sensitive to Jewish concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the changes, I think that anti-Semitism is not the problem of the 
play in 1990," Otto Huber said in a telephone interview this week from his home 
in Oberammergau. 
</P>
<P>
The Passion Play dates to 1663, when bubonic plague ravaged the mountain valley 
where Oberammergau sits. When the Roman Catholic villagers vowed to stage a 
passion play every 10 years if the plague abated, the epidemic vanished in what 
was considered a miracle, according to historical accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The play was last performed in 1984, when a special jubilee production 
attracted 470,000 spectators. Americans accounted for about 45% of the visitors 
to the daylong production. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, leaders of the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith have sought to change aspects of the play they believed 
maligned Jews and blamed them for the Crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that Jewish people have collective guilt for Jesus' death has been 
devastating in its impact on Jews throughout the centuries, Rudin said. 
</P>
<P>
The play will be performed this year from May 21 to Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes: 
</P>
<P>
* Jesus' identity as a Jew is emphasized, including having him and his 
followers wear traditional prayer shawls. "We have tried to show Jesus really 
as a Jew coming out from Jewish tradition and Jewish faith," Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
* Jesus has a larger popular following among Jews, and there is no longer a 
separation of Jesus and his followers and the rest of the Jewish community in 
light and dark clothing. "You had the good guys and the bad guys in the 1984 
text," Rudin said. 
</P>
<P>
* There is no longer any connection between the temple merchants and Jesus' 
persecutors. Rudin said that connection was "one of the worst stereotypes of 
the play," playing on anti-Semitic images such as "Shylock." 
</P>
<P>
* The Jewish high priests who presided at the trial that led to the 
condemnation of Jesus will no longer have horns, an image carried over from the 
Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
* Pontius Pilate, who prior to 1984 was portrayed a noble Roman and in 1984 was 
shown as ambivalent in sentencing Jesus to death, is presented in the 1990 text 
as an unsympathetic, brutal character. 
</P>
<P>
* Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, is portrayed as a confused 
character who lost faith in Jesus, rather than as a man motivated only by the 
30 pieces of silver he received for giving up Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
Huber said the changes show that Oberammergau is "very conscious about all the 
questions of anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the passage from Matthew was barely approved by a 11-9 vote of 
the text committee, and only with the provision that a five-page explanation 
saying it does not apply to one race and outlining the history of anti-Semitism 
surrounding it be included in scripts that tourists purchase to follow the 
German-language play. 
</P>
<P>
While it may be difficult to find someone to write a new play, Huber said, he 
favors continuing discussions for the production in 2000.

FAITHFUL COLLECTORS ARE BULLISH ON TEDDY BEAR MARKET 
</P>

<P>
Ranked as the fourth biggest hobby behind stamps, dolls and coins, teddy bear 
collecting is growing. And, while collectors buy contemporary bears, many soon 
get hooked on finding the old fellows. No doubt, antique teddy bears are an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
One hunter of old teddy bears is Donna Lee Harrison. After eight years 
retailing, hunting and promoting the stuffed animals, she is now a teddy bear 
broker, one of about six in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
An energetic, friendly woman who wears bear jewelry and drives a van with 
license plates reading TEDDY B, she has a personal collection of about 500 
teddy bears in all sizes, shapes, colors and vintages. 
</P>
<P>
Her initial purchase was very small. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at a doll show and saw a doll holding this little tiny bear, a 3 
1/2-inch Steiff. I didn't want the doll, but I loved that little bear," says 
Harrison. "And I paid $25 for him in 1980 -- originally these miniatures sold 
for about 50 cents a dozen -- and I just sold him last year for $1,200 to pay 
for my mother's 70th birthday party." 
</P>
<P>
As a teddy specialist, Harrison buys and sells bears on commission for a 
growing list of teddy bear collectors in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
As owner of Donna's Bear and Toy Mart in Hampden, she keeps one eye on her 
shelves and antique cabinets filled with sellable bears and one eye on her 
computer screen to determine who wants what on the bear market. 
</P>
<P>
While Harrison buys and sells contemporary limited-edition teddy bears and 
artist bears designed and handmade by professional craftspeople, she 
specializes in antique bears. These old teddy bears can command prices of up to 
$10,000, a top price paid by a major collector for a prized 1903 Steiff bear 
found by Harrison at an auction. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison has antique bears in her office ranging in value from about $250 for a 
1920s German bear to $8,500 for a rare 1907 Steiff. 
</P>
<P>
A major business problem, however, is the scarcity of old bears on the market 
and the great number of bear hunters. Chuck Gill, a spokesman for Cumberland's 
Hobby House Press, publisher of the magazine Teddy Bear and Friends, reports 
that there are an estimated half-million teddy bear collectors in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison says the dearth of old bears is understandable, considering the 
perishable quality of the mohair, excelsior and other materials used to make 
them. But, more important, early teddy bears were toys. The teddy bear was 
involved in the nitty-gritty of play, including forays through deep, dark mud 
puddles, climbs in the highest of back-yard trees, romps through dangerous 
woods, and frolics at special picnics or high teas. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, Harrison says, "many people literally loved their teddies to death." 
</P>
<P>
So to find antique bears, she travels to the big London auction houses three 
times a year, scouts flea markets, antiques stores and attics, especially in 
Germany and England, employs "pickers," people who will search when she is not 
available, and attends shows, conventions and estate sales. 
</P>
<P>
She is also constantly viewing and reviewing teddy bear collections. And, while 
she does buy some younger bears, she is basically looking for bears made before 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, an item has to be almost 100 years old to be classified as an 
antique, and there are just not any teddy bears that old," says Harrison. "So, 
generally, we consider any bear made before 1940 to be an antique." 
</P>
<P>
How far back do teddy bears go? 
</P>
<P>
According to Pat Schoonmaker in "A Collector's History of the Teddy Bear," 
Indian children in north-central Arizona played with a bearlike toy. But bears 
really didn't surface as toys until the mid-1800s, when mechanical bears became 
popular and bears started showing up in stories and drawings for children. 
</P>
<P>
However, as of 1900, the true teddy bear toy, a jointed, huggable creature of 
fur and filling, had not appeared on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
So where did the little guy (David Worland, a walking encyclopedia of the bear 
facts and owner of the largest collection of teddy bears in Australia, insists 
that all teddy bears are boys) come from? 
</P>
<P>
While there is running debate on the nationality of great-great-grandteddy, the 
year of his birth is definitely 1902, Schoonmaker says. She believes that the 
first bear toy was designed that year by Richard Steiff, nephew of Margarete 
Steiff, who founded the Steiff toy empire in Giengen, Germany. By 1903, the 
Steiff company was shipping bears, or "Bruins," as they were called, to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
But another event in 1902 challenges the Germanic origin of the first teddy 
bear. In that year, President Theodore Roosevelt went to Smedes, Miss., to 
settle a boundary dispute and hunt some bear. On the last day of the trip, the 
President was bearless. Accompanying hunters found an old, sick bear, tethered 
it to a tree and invited Roosevelt to shoot it. He refused, supposedly saying 
that to do such a thing would be unsportsmanlike and would upset his children. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford Berryman, a political cartoonist of the day, drew a cartoon showing 
Roosevelt refusing to shoot the bear. The cartoon was so popular that Berryman 
continued to draw a small bear whenever he drew a Roosevelt cartoon. Within 
months, Roosevelt and the bear were forever linked. 
</P>
<P>
Morris Michtom, a Russian immigrant who owned a confectionary shop in Brooklyn, 
saw marketing opportunities in Roosevelt's bear. He designed a plush bear cub, 
had wife Rosa stitch it up, and displayed it in his store window. The toy bear 
was an instant sensation. Within months of the 1902 bear-hunting incident in 
Mississippi, Michtom was in business as the Ideal Novelty and Toy Co. -- later 
the Ideal Toy Co. -- making bears. 
</P>
<P>
And, although there is no written documentation, the Michtom family says that 
Morris sent a sample bear to Roosevelt along with a letter asking for 
permission to use his nickname, "Teddy." Roosevelt approved. 
</P>
<P>
World War I brought an end to bear mania until 1969, when the late British 
actor Peter Bull published "The Teddy Bear Book" and suddenly teddy bears and 
teddy bear collecting became fashionable again. Bear lovers began coming out of 
the closet, dragging their much-loved teddy bears with them. 
</P>
<P>
Since then the price increases have been phenomenal, according to Dee 
Hockenberry, author of three books on teddy bears and collecting. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing for collectors to pay between $2,500 and $10,000 for a special 
antique bear," she says. 
</P>
<P>
While it is hard to say what bear will bring what price, Hockenberry votes for 
pre-1910 Steiff bears, considered the creme de la creme. She says large bears, 
up to about 36 inches tall, and those in excellent condition -- no mohair loss, 
original eyes, only minor holes in pads -- usually bring the most money. But, 
she adds, "the face is very important." 
</P>
<P>
Worland is a great believer in bear faces. Known as the "teddy bear man of 
Australia," he has a personal collection of between 100 and 200 bears, valued 
at about $100,000, and all residing comfortably in the bear room at his home in 
Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how rare or old a bear is," says Worland, "if the face isn't 
nice, isn't great, I don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
Worland has a bear bragger's book with pictures of some of his antique bears. 
They include Mullins, Barrington and Harrison, the latter a 1903 bear bought 
from Donna Harrison and known as "the oldest bear in Australia." All three are 
Steiffs, bought at different times over the last few years for a collective 
price of $14,500, and are now worth about $20,000.

STAGHORN FERNS CAN THRIVE IN SOUTHLAND YARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN HEYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its native Australia or New Guinea, the staghorn fern grows high in a tree, 
drinking in moisture from incessant tropical humidity and rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
But once established, staghorns -- as ferns go -- need relatively little water 
and thus are the perfect exotic conversation piece for a Southland garden or 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
"The staghorn fern is a pretty hardy soul," says Wade Roberts, garden director 
at Sherman Library and Gardens in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"It will survive to about 20 degrees. A coastal area is ideal for growing them, 
but one can also grow them inland." 
</P>
<P>
Flat, sterile fronds grow at the plant's base to support antler-shaped fertile 
fronds that give the plant its striking appearance. Because the staghorn fern 
is an epiphyte (a non-parasitic plant that grows on another), it can be mounted 
on a board or piece of bark and hung on a tree or a wall. 
</P>
<P>
Though nature's design calls for them to grab all the moisture and nutrients 
they need from the air, staghorns benefit from watering and feeding in Southern 
California's arid climate. 
</P>
<P>
"Treat the plant like it's raining," says Roberts. You can sprinkle it weekly 
with a hose or water wand. Any balanced plant food that is soluble can be 
applied monthly when watering, as the staghorn will absorb food and drink 
through its foliage. 
</P>
<P>
If the plant is under stress -- too dry, for example -- fertilizing should wait 
until it is more robust. 
</P>
<P>
Heat will not hurt the staghorn, he says, but a lack of humidity will. Besides 
watering directly, steam up the plant's surroundings by watering the ground 
beneath it or using a fogging nozzle, available at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts will discuss staghorns and their cousins, moosehorn ferns -- or 
Platycerium bifurcatum and P. grande, as botanists know them -- at a program 
today at 9:30 a.m. at Sherman Gardens. Presented as part of the facility's 
Weekend Gardener series, his lecture will cover the ferns' culture and how to 
use them in a garden. 
</P>
<P>
The moosehorn fern must be hung on the appropriate size mounting, Roberts says. 
It will probably need remounting three times in its life, ending up on a board 
that is perhaps 4 or 5 foot square. Its fuzzy shield fronds face upward to 
catch rainfall, dust and whatever falls from the air; from this, the plant 
makes its own nourishing compost. 
</P>
<P>
More difficult to grow than the staghorn, the moosehorn is one showy set of 
fronds and reproduces by spores. 
</P>
<P>
The staghorn, by contrast, puts out "pups" from its base. They can be left in 
place or removed, once they have several shield fronds, and mounted to start a 
whole new plant.

"The key is not getting an extremely young little pup," Roberts says, "but to 
get one large enough to have enough root to mount on small board and have it 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
Make sure it has enough moisture to get established, and it will soon become 
tough enough to survive periodic benign neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Though the ferns will grow some clinging roots of their own, they also need 
occasional attention to their mountings to ensure that they don't become heavy 
and fall. They can be secured to a board or tree with non-copper wire or strong 
strips of plastic. New shield fronds will soon cover the wires. Old base fronds 
may need to be cut away, but their brown papery appearance is perfectly normal. 
</P>
<P>
As a project for beginning gardeners, Roberts says the staghorn and moosehorn 
ferns are "highly recommended." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Platyceriums, "those are the two that the homeowner can grow and have 
success with," he says. They are widely available at nurseries; a nursery that 
doesn't have them in stock can easily order them. 
</P>
<P>
At his program today, Roberts will demonstrate proper mounting and remounting 
of the ferns and explain their care and feeding. The lecture is free and open 
to the public at the Gardens.

<P>
Buying antiques is a lot like gourmet cooking -- it's easier than many people 
think. 
</P>
<P>
According to Country Home magazine, common sense, knowledge and a little 
practice is all that is needed. 
</P>
<P>
For best results, follow this advice from Stephen Roedler, director of the 
Manhattan Arts and Antiques Center, the oldest and largest antiques collective 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
* Specialize. Concentrate on a single period or genre. 
</P>
<P>
* Study. Take courses and visit museums to learn what factors make antiques 
most valuable. 
</P>
<P>
* Socialize. Join historical societies or clubs to meet like-minded collectors. 
Get to know dealers in the specialty area whose tastes are admired. 
</P>
<P>
* Browse. Get an overview of prices and selection before buying. 
</P>
<P>
* Buy quality. Obtain the best items, even it if means buying less.

KEEFE IS A PIVOTAL FACTOR; 
</P>
<P>
STANFORD: SOPHOMORE PLAYS BASKETBALL LIKE AN OLD-TIMER AND VOLLEYBALL LIKE 
KARCH KIRALY.

<P>
When Adam Keefe phoned Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery to tell him that he 
planned to play for the Cardinal, the news was greeted by silence at the other 
end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Had Montgomery fainted? 
</P>
<P>
Stanford, its exemplary academic reputation notwithstanding, doesn't often win 
recruiting battles against North Carolina for blue-chip basketball players. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Montgomery realized his coup, it took him a few seconds to collect his 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you say?" he asked, recalling his moment of silence. "You don't want 
to understate it, but you don't want to be an idiot and jump through the 
phone." 
</P>
<P>
Not that he wasn't tempted. 
</P>
<P>
At Woodbridge High School in Irvine, Keefe was not just a great prospect with 
the grades and board scores to get into Stanford, he was a great prospect, 
period. 
</P>
<P>
And as a sophomore this season, the 6-foot-9, 220-pound Keefe has shown why 
Montgomery considers Keefe to be the most important addition in the coach's 3 
1/2 seasons on the Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Despite routinely facing unorthodox defenses concocted specifically to deny him 
the ball, Keefe is the No. 4 scorer in the Pacific 10 and leads the conference 
in rebounding and field-goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's Lute Olson and USC's George Raveling are among the coaches who have 
described the Cardinal's redhead as the best pivotman on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most fundamentally sound postman in the conference since Bill 
Walton," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Efficient and well schooled in the peculiarities of the pivot, Keefe is "a 
throwback to the old days," Raveling said. "I haven't seen a guy in a long, 
long time who knows how to play in the post like Adam Keefe. He could have 
played back in the days of (Bob) Cousy and (Bill) Sharman." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to suggest that Keefe's bruising, economical style has fallen out 
of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, Montgomery said: "Everybody liked Adam. You couldn't watch 
Adam and not like the way that he played. You might not think he was the best 
player in the country, or the best power forward, but you couldn't not like the 
way that he played." 
</P>
<P>
And how's that? 
</P>
<P>
"If I come out of a game and I'm not dripping and my shirt's not clinging to my 
back, I feel like I've let myself down," Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's academic reputation played a major role in luring Keefe to Palo 
Alto. He plans to live in Southern California and, he said, "a degree from 
Stanford means a lot more in Orange County than a degree from North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
As much as anything, though, Keefe didn't want to give up volleyball, which is 
not played on an intercollegiate level at North Carolina. Keefe has the 
potential, his coaches say, to be a world-class volleyball player. 
</P>
<P>
It has been said that Keefe dominated at the high school level like nobody 
since Karch Kiraly, a two-time Olympian who was widely regarded as the best 
player in the world before he retired from the U.S. team last summer. 
</P>
<P>
His coach at Stanford, Fred Sturm, said that if Keefe played volleyball full 
time, "He would become one of the very best players this country has ever had 
-- and he might become the best." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, after helping Stanford reach the NCAA basketball tournament for 
the first time in 47 years, Keefe joined the Cardinal volleyball team as a 
reserve middle blocker almost five months into a six-month season and helped 
the Cardinal reach the NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Neville of the U.S. team has extended Keefe an open invitation to 
train with the national team. Last summer, Keefe was asked to play in an 
international tournament in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider him a part of our program, and that avenue is open to him," 
Neville said. "Unfortunately for us, a lot of other avenues are going to be 
open to him that are more financially lucrative." 
</P>
<P>
By that, of course, he meant that Keefe probably has a future in the NBA. Keefe 
turned down the volleyball trip to Moscow so that he could try out for the U.S. 
basketball team that played in the World University Games. 
</P>
<P>
A toe injury, however, limited his effectiveness and he was cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I should enjoy basketball more because I've been playing it 
longer, I've put more hours in, I've worked harder for a longer period of 
time," Keefe said. "I almost feel an obligation to the sport because it's the 
one paying the bills. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, volleyball allows me to take a step back and maybe have a 
little bit more fun; maybe have 200 people in the gym instead of 7,500; be able 
to smile a little more. It just seems like the pressure's not there, the TV's 
not there. My parents aren't going to call and say, 'Why'd you argue that call? 
You looked like a fool.' " 
</P>
<P>
And in volleyball, Keefe won't be surrounded and suffocated by rival defenses, 
as he has been in basketball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, as the new kid on the block of a senior-dominated team, Keefe 
didn't draw much attention as Stanford's sixth man. He averaged 8.4 points and 
5.4 rebounds a game, averaging less than 20 minutes but making 63.3% of his 
shots. And toward the end of the season, he showed flashes of what lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pac-10 tournament, he scored 17 points against USC. He scored 22 points 
and took 11 rebounds against UCLA. Then, against Siena in the first round of 
the NCAA tournament, he scored 22 again. 
</P>
<P>
Relying more on physical strength than finesse, Keefe has significantly 
increased his productivity this season, averaging 19.1 points and 9.3 rebounds 
while making 65.8% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He just rolls up his sleeves and comes out of the fray with (impressive) 
numbers," Montgomery said. "He's less concerned about the periphery than some. 
He just really enjoys competition. And he takes challenges personally." 
</P>
<P>
Keefe has faced more than his share this season. 
</P>
<P>
Almost nobody has played a straight man-to-man defense against Keefe since he 
scored 18 points in the first half last month against UCLA, making all five of 
his shots and eight of nine free throws. The Bruins switched to a box-and-one 
in the second half, holding Keefe to five points. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Washington surrounded Keefe with three players, assigning two 
others to guards John Patrick and Kenny Ammann and all but ignoring forwards 
Deshon Wingate and Andrew Vlahov. Bothered by a sprained ankle, Keefe scored 
only nine points, making two of eight shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the theory in the league now is, 'If we're going to lose, we're going 
to lose to the other four guys,' " Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
So, against UCLA, guards Patrick and Ammann combined for 39 points. Against 
Washington, Wingate scored a career-high 22 points and grabbed 14 rebounds. 
Stanford won both games. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets frustrating," Keefe said of the attention focused on him, "but I just 
have to realize that maybe I'm freeing up other people for their shots and 
helping somebody else get a rebound." 
</P>
<P>
Said Montgomery: "It's been very difficult for him, but his presence has made 
our other players better. That's what separates the great players. They can 
make the players around them better." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, a reporter wrote that Keefe "wouldn't know how to spell finesse if 
you handed him a Funk &amp; Wagnalls," but Montgomery disputes that notion. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not given much of an opportunity to be a finesse player because people 
are attacking him," the coach said. "If he were soft or weak-hearted, he'd be 
getting dominated." 
</P>
<P>
The youngest son of a retired Marine officer, Keefe "started with a willingness 
to get dirty, a tough, play-as-hard-as-you-have-to attitude," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, it wouldn't be accurate to call Keefe a brute. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got good touch," Montgomery said. "He's a very good shooter. He doesn't 
miss very often, and he can make those shots while being bumped. It's not fair 
to say finesse is not part of his game. He's not a bully, but he just seems to 
be around other people a lot." 
</P>
<P>
One of them is Montgomery, who is grateful for the privilege.

MOTOR RACING DAYTONA 500;

THESE CARS ON CRUISE CONTROL

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-four cars will start in the Daytona 500 Sunday, but only 42 are official 
entries in stock car racing's biggest event. 
</P>
<P>
Two, starting at the rear, will be movie cars shooting footage for the Tom 
Cruise film, "Days of Thunder," which is set in the environment of NASCAR 
racing. Cruise is here, too, but he won't be driving in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Sacks and Bobby Hamilton, two licensed Winston Cup drivers, will do the 
driving during the race. They will be in Chevrolets owned and prepared by Rick 
Hendrick Motorsports, the same team that owns the cars driven by defending 
champion Darrell Waltrip and top qualifier Ken Schrader. 
</P>
<P>
"During the race, the cars will be involved just as if they were racing, but 
obviously we'll be diligent about not screwing up the process of the race," 
said co-producer Don Simpson of Paramount Pictures, who also worked with Cruise 
in "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
There is no question about the quality of the cars. During the Autoworks 200 
last November at Phoenix International Raceway, Hamilton actually led the race 
for a lap when most of the other cars pitted during a yellow caution period. 
</P>
<P>
"We had NASCAR black-flag (call in) Hamilton because that wasn't what we 
wanted," Simpson said. "But it did show something about how strong the cars are 
that Hendrick provided." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, in the Busch Clash, Sacks drove one of the movie cars to second 
place behind Schrader. He had qualified for the race, limited to 1989 
pole-sitters, by winning a wild-card draw among second-day qualifiers during 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
When Sacks didn't have a ride for this season, Hendrick lent him the car to 
drive in the Clash, and may have a car for him in limited races this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Greg deserved the chance after watching the way he drove at Phoenix 
in the movie car," Hendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
At Phoenix, the only other Winston Cup race in which movie cars participated, 
Hamilton qualified fifth and Sacks 30th as part of the official field. For the 
Daytona 500, producers Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer and NASCAR officials 
decided in the interest of fairness that the movie car drivers should not try 
to qualify but run as unofficial entries. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie cars will not be included in the official standings, will not 
receive prize money or car owner/driver points," assured Les Richter, NASCAR 
vice president for competition. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 42 drivers will receive an added $2,400 for their part in the film. 
The crowd of an anticipated 150,000 will perform free, however. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators who lingered after Thursday's Twin 125 qualifying races received a 
bonus when Cruise, stripped to the waist, was strapped to a stretcher and 
lifted by helicopter from the front straightaway. Later, they also saw Cruise 
drive his race car around the track -- escorted by a camera car -- and take the 
checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Bruckheimer would not say how the scenes fit into the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Days of Thunder," Simpson insisted, is not a story about racing, such as 
"LeMans," "Winning," or "Grand Prix," which he labeled as "boring," but is a 
film about people in an atmosphere of race cars. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be only 12 to 13 minutes of racing in about a two-hour film," 
Simpson said. "What we want is to create the atmosphere of racing, not a racing 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted our picture to be character-driven, not event-driven. The picture is 
not about the Daytona 500, but the Daytona 500 is one of the stars of the 
movie. We would like to think that 'Days of Thunder' will do for stock car 
racing what 'Top Gun' did for airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
The picture, scheduled for release in the summer, is based loosely on the 
careers of the late Tim Richmond as a race driver, played by Cruise; crew chief 
Harry Hyde, played by Robert Duvall, and car owner/businessman Hendrick, played 
by Randy Quaid. 
</P>
<P>
Cruise became interested in racing after attending Bob Bondurant's driving 
school at Sears Point Raceway in California while making "Top Gun." Later, 
according to Simpson, Cruise got the idea for the picture while driving race 
cars with fellow actor Paul Newman, who is also an Indy-car owner. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to base our film on NASCAR instead of Indy-cars because in this 
series the drivers are stars, and in Indy-cars the cars are the show," Simpson 
said. "Stock car racing is more gladiatorial."

ANGELS SIGN MCCASKILL, CLOSE ARBITRATION BOOK 
</P>

<P>
Although inactivity remains the rule for locked-out players, the Angels' front 
office has not been idle. 
</P>
<P>
The club on Friday reached agreement with Kirk McCaskill on a one-year contract 
that will pay the 28-year-old right-hander slightly less than $970,000 plus 
incentives based on the number of innings he pitches, avoiding an arbitration 
hearing that had been scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill was 15-10 last season with a 2.93 earned-run average and four 
shutouts, tying him for second in the American League. McCaskill, who earned 
$400,000 last season, had sought $1.185 million and the Angels had offered 
$750,000. McCaskill's name has often been mentioned in trade rumors since the 
signing of Mark Langston gave the Angels six starters, but any deal would 
probably would be delayed because of the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill's case was the last to be settled of the 12 Angels who were eligible 
to file for arbitration. Nine players agreed to contracts, Wally Joyner and 
Devon White had arbitration hearings and the Angels declined to go to 
arbitration with Greg Minton, who declared himself a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Dan O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice president for baseball operations, said 
from his Anaheim office that he hopes to sign infielders Mark McLemore, Bobby 
Rose and Kent Anderson and outfielder Lee Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to continue to negotiate while we're waiting," O'Brien said. "I'm 
delighted we've put to rest this particular issue, the players who were 
eligible for arbitration. Now it's time to get on with the rest of it." 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the baseball lockout, tarpaulins were placed on the 
pitching mounds of the fields at Gene Autry Park, where the Angels train. 
Otherwise, the silence was as oppressive as it was Thursday, when pitchers, 
catchers and injured players were kept out. 
</P>
<P>
Minor league players -- who are not covered by the Major League Players Assn.'s 
rules -- and non-roster players were instructed by the Angels not to report to 
Mesa, and Brian Bossard, the field manager in charge of the facility, said 
Friday that no players had come by. He and his crew are keeping the fields 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Hall, a desk clerk at the Hilton Pavilion in Mesa, said the Angels had 
canceled their reserved block of about 70 rooms Thursday. Although he was 
disappointed the team didn't arrive as originally scheduled, he was pleased 
that the rooms didn't stay unoccupied for long. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it would be a problem, but they filled right up," he said. "All the 
hotels in the area are full. People are still coming." 
</P>
<P>
That could cause a few headaches should the impasse be resolved soon and the 
Angels again need a large number of rooms. "I think we'd work something out in 
that case," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Although camps are closed, several teams that train in the 
Mesa-Scottsdale-Tempe area conducted workouts for their minor league players at 
various sites. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Giants put 32 minor leaguers through their paces at Indian 
School Park in Scottsdale, but none is on the team's 40-man roster. The Oakland 
Athletics were arranging workouts at Scottsdale Community College. The Chicago 
Cubs, who spend the spring in Mesa, had no players working out.

One of the few men with absolute power to end baseball's lockout fitted his key 
into the deadbolt. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said," remarked the official as he opened the door to the Dodgers' 
spring clubhouse. "Empty." 
</P>
<P>
The room didn't look or feel like baseball. It didn't even smell like baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It was crammed with empty lockers -- metal ones lining the walls, wooden ones 
scattered and stacked across the middle of the floor. Underneath the clutter 
was a pile of long boxes, taped shut so one could only assume they were bats. 
Draped across a table were heaps of dark blue towels. This was not a locker 
room, but a storage room. 
</P>
<P>
"Strange, isn't it?" asked the official, who wished to remain anonymous. "This 
room could belong to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Try spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is a ghost town," said Dodger minor leaguer Bill Bene, one of 57 
prospects who began spring training Friday in the invisible shadows of the 
missing 38 major league Dodger players and their five coaches. On this first 
scheduled day of workouts at Dodgertown, the lockout of baseball's major 
leaguers by the owners became both official and noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
The minor leaguers were scattered among five fields. The buildings were 
strangely quiet as they baked in the mid-afternoon sun. Dodgertown Theatre got 
into the dispirit of things Friday night by showing "Scrooged." 
</P>
<P>
And the fans said the heck with it. Last year, on the first day of workouts, 
observers estimated that more than 500 people crowded the Dodgertown sidewalks 
and grassy paths. Friday, the total was closer to 30. 
</P>
<P>
They came not because they wanted to cheer, but because they were curious. They 
did not ask for autographs, or try to shake hands. It became apparent most of 
them were not sure what they were watching. 
</P>
<P>
This was because, for the first time in recent years, the minor leaguers did 
not wear the white major league jerseys with their names on the back. They all 
wore minor league blue, with no identification other than a number. It was as 
if the Dodgers wanted nobody to forget the lockout, including those players 
with major league experience who had been invited here and promised that they 
would be treated like major leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were talking about having to rush my big league jersey down from Los 
Angeles, and now I get here and everything has changed," pitcher Mike Munoz 
said. "Everyone is treated the same, everyone is treated like a minor leaguer, 
no matter what. It's different than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
Said Billy Bean, another major league prospect: "They want to make sure 
everybody knows this is a minor league camp. It brings all of us back to 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
For those minor leaguers who thought they would be receiving pointers and pine 
tar from their favorite millionaires, it was an even bigger disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of a drag," said Eric Karros, a former UCLA star scheduled to 
start this season at double-A San Antonio. He hit several long batting practice 
home runs in front of minor league coaches, then yawned. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem like we're going at it like last year," he said. "Not the same 
excitement. It's like we're just waiting for the big league guys to show up." 
</P>
<P>
So are Dodger officials. While Vice President Fred Claire and Manager Tom 
Lasorda have been cleared to attend, they will not arrive until next week. Even 
the Dodger major league scouts have been asked to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes sense," scout Mel Didier said from his Texas home. "What do I scout 
when I get there? An empty field?" 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda wasn't taking things so patiently. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just sitting here waiting and hoping," Lasorda said. "I just want to get 
the word that, hey, this thing is over with and we can get started. We've got a 
lot of question marks on this team. We have a lot of work to do." 
</P>
<P>
The delay may force Lasorda to carry more than the usual 10 pitchers, simply 
because the starters won't be able to pitch as long. 
</P>
<P>
"This will test our bullpen, because the starters really need six weeks of 
spring training," Lasorda said. "If they don't get it, they might only be able 
to go five or six innings in their first few starts. We'll need more guys down 
in the bullpen." 
</P>
<P>
Such a decision would affect the fate of pitchers such as Tim Crews, Mike 
Hartley, Pat Perry and Munoz, all of whom could be fighting for the fifth and 
final spot in the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
With Lasorda missing, probably the most noticeable man at camp was not a player 
or a coach, but muscular John Skinner, who wears a shirt and tie -- and a 
beeper. He was seen peeking around corners and checking fields, with a list of 
non-roster players under his arm and a frown on his face. He said he worked for 
the commissioners' office, but would offer no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, they just sent somebody here to make sure everybody is following the 
rules," said Guy Wellman, the minicamp director. "Every camp got one of those 
guards. This ain't your usual year."

Pete Rose has agreed to do daily baseball commentary for a radio station -- his 
first media venture since his lifetime banishment from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cincinnati Red manager will do three-minute daily commentaries and a 
once-a-week interview with a sports broadcaster on WCKY-AM in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The station said the features are scheduled to begin March 19 and continue 
through the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was banned from baseball last August after admitting he bet with 
bookmakers. While he was manager, Rose did daily interviews on the Reds' radio 
network.

HANSEN ANSWERS CHARGES OF RACE FIXING AT HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockey Ron Hansen, barred from riding at Golden Gate Fields Feb. 4, answered 
charges of impropriety against him during a hearing before the California Horse 
Racing Board Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing referee Benjamin Felton was to make a recommendation on whether Hansen 
should be permanently barred or reinstated and the CHRB will make the final 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen, the leading rider at the Albany track, is accused by a former jockey of 
fixing races. Hansen's alleged association with a man convicted of bank fraud 
was also explored during the seven-hour hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Schrick reportedly told CHRB investigators and FBI agents that Hansen 
approached him about fixing races. A former Golden Gate Fields jockey, Schrick 
has been suspended for 10 years for offering a jockey a bribe and faces 
criminal bribery charges. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's principal witness was his former girlfriend, Julie Adams of Newport 
Beach. She testified that she also had been romantically involved with Schrick 
and that Schrick was pursuing a vendetta against Hansen.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
IT COULD BE BIG YEAR FOR MCANALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally's barn earned more than $2.7 million last year, its best 
performance since John Henry's second horse-of-the-year campaign in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with $600,000 already in the till, McAnally could do even better. 
Bayakoa, who may or may not start Sunday in the $300,000 Santa Margarita 
Handicap, and Hawkster are established runners, and the 57-year-old McAnally 
has five 3-year-olds capable of taking him to the Kentucky Derby at Churchill 
Downs May 5. 
</P>
<P>
"You never make plans, because anything can happen in racing," McAnally said. 
"But in the next five or six weeks, the Derby horses will start falling into 
place, and we've got five colts with a lot of quality. I think our chances are 
excellent of having at least one of them go to the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally's barn at Santa Anita is usually busy, but on Friday business was 
especially brisk. McAnally was on the telephone to Kansas, discussing with 
owner Frank Whitham whether his Bayakoa should accept the high weight of 127 
pounds and try to win the 1 1/8-mile Santa Margarita for the second straight 
year. Out on the track, two of those promising 3-year-olds were working. Single 
Dawn went six furlongs in 1:11 3/5, much faster than McAnally wanted, and 
Silver Ending covered the same distance in 1:14 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
The others in McAnally's quintet are Balla Cove and Tight Spot, stakes winners 
who will run in the one-mile San Rafael Stakes at Santa Anita March 3, and King 
of the Scots, a son of Chief's Crown who will run in a maiden race Sunday. In 
1985, Chief's Crown was a major winner before and after the Triple Crown 
series, but he was second in the Preakness and third in both the Derby and the 
Belmont after going off the favorite in all three races. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Ending, an improbable $1,500 yearling who was named by McAnally's wife, 
Debbie, because of his gray tail, is the most highly rated of this bunch, 
mainly because he has been the most visible. In his 3-year-old debut, Silver 
Ending won the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows. The best horse Silver 
Ending beat was probably his stablemate, Single Dawn, who ran third. 
</P>
<P>
It was the way Silver Ending won that was impressive. "In the stretch, he was 
head and head with the other horse (Individualist I)," McAnally said. "All Gary 
(Stevens) did was flick his stick, and the horse quickly accelerated to win by 
three lengths." 
</P>
<P>
McAnally expected more of Single Dawn that day, but he was beaten by five 
lengths. "He was carrying seven more pounds than Silver Ending," the trainer 
said. "And the kid (jockey Alex Solis) told me afterward that he moved too soon 
with the horse." 
</P>
<P>
Because McAnally's Derby prospects race for different owners, he will have to 
do some juggling to minimize their running against each other. Silver Ending's 
next start is scheduled to be the 1 1/16-mile San Felipe Handicap at Santa 
Anita on March 18. Single Dawn will be shipped to Gulfstream Park to run in the 
1 1/8-mile Florida Derby the day before. 
</P>
<P>
That means Single Dawn will face what appears to be a deep field of 3-year-olds 
from the East. But McAnally believes he will have his colt ready, coming off a 
two-month layoff. Last year, McAnally sent Hawkster to Gulfstream, where he 
wilted in the Florida humidity and ran fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Balla Cove, bred in England, has been quickly introduced to dirt racing here. 
He ran seventh in last November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream, then 
dead-heated for the win in Santa Anita's Los Feliz Stakes with Land Rush, who 
may be the best of trainer Wayne Lukas' 20 Triple Crown nominees after Grand 
Canyon's injury. 
</P>
<P>
Tight Spot, running a mile in 1:34 while winning the El Cerrito Handicap at 
Golden Gate Fields three weeks ago, is not yet eligible for the Triple Crown 
races. He could have been nominated for $600 by Jan. 17, but McAnally said he 
expects him to made eligible for a $3,000 payment that is due by March 17. 
</P>
<P>
It won't bother trainer Neil Drysdale if McAnally withholds Bayakoa from the 
Santa Margarita. Drysdale's Gorgeous will be favored if Bayakoa is scratched to 
run in the $1-million Santa Anita Handicap March 4. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm running a horse, I'd like to see an exhibition race," Drysdale said. 
"A walkover would be fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
Even without Bayakoa, the Santa Margarita will have a six-horse field. This is 
the lineup, in post-position order with jockeys and weights: 
</P>
<P>
Carita Tostada, Sandy Hawley, 110 pounds; Kelly, Pat Valenzuela, 112; Nikishka, 
Gary Stevens, 115; Gorgeous, Eddie Delahoussaye, 125; Luthier's Launch, Alex 
Solis, 113; Invited Guest, Russell Baze, 114, and Bayakoa, Chris McCarron 127. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who rode Bayakoa last year as she won nine of 11 starts and was 
voted an Eclipse Award, was scheduled to ride the 6-year-old mare Sunday, but 
he has decided to take more time for his broken collarbone to heal. Pincay told 
McAnally that he will resume riding next week. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Warcraft, a son of Ack Ack who might be trainer Charlie Whittingham's best hope 
for returning to the Kentucky Derby, runs Sunday at Santa Anita in a mile 
allowance race. . . . Summer Squall, undefeated in six 2-year-old starts while 
never running farther than 6 1/2 furlongs, will make his 1990 debut on Feb. 25, 
facing older horses in a seven-furlong race at Gulfstream. 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally has trained four horses in the Kentucky Derby. His best finishes 
were fourths with Super Moment in 1980 and Water Bank in 1982. Super Moment is 
now at stud in Switzerland. . . . McAnally's horses earned $4.3 million in 
1984, more than half of the total won by John Henry. . . . Quiet American, 
second to Flying Continental in the Strub, may be headed for Gulfstream to run 
in the $200,000 Donn Handicap next Saturday.

DRIVER BAN IS UPHELD BY COURT;

<P>
HARNESS RACING: LOS ALAMITOS MAY USE PAST SUCCESS AS YARDSTICK FOR LIMITING 
COMPETITION, JUDGE DECIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Judge John G. Davies has denied a request for an injunction that would 
allow 13 harness drivers the opportunity to drive at Los Alamitos Race Course. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion filed Thursday and released Friday, Davies said that Los Alamitos 
has the right to bar the drivers from the track. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers had been excluded on the basis of experience and lack of past 
success by Lloyd Arnold, Los Alamitos president and part-owner. 
</P>
<P>
"A much more viable concern appears to be the possibility that if the Court 
forces Los Alamitos to allow plaintiffs (the drivers) access to the meet as 
drivers, the other 130 or so drivers who could not qualify under the new 
standards will seek similar relief," the 10-page opinion said. "This would 
place an unreasonable burden upon defendant (Los Alamitos), particularly in 
light of the possibility the defendant will prevail in the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Craigo, an attorney representing the drivers, said his clients will get 
a hearing Friday before the California Horse Racing Board. The drivers will ask 
the board to overturn Arnold's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The blacklisting of these largely minority and economically disadvantaged 
drivers, without a semblance of due process of law, was recently upheld in an 
action by the state stewards at Los Alamitos," Craigo said. "Incredibly, Judge 
Davies' opinion does not even address this critical event. We are confident 
that a ruling which so ignores constitutional guarantees cannot previal." 
</P>
<P>
Craigo made reference to a stewards' decision on Jan. 18, whereby Ron Cassini, 
who does not meet minimum driver qualifications, was allowed to drive in a 
California Sires Stakes race at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kuebler, director of racing at Los Alamitos, said the track would allow 
exceptions to drivers who had made advance payments before the driver 
qualification standards were announced. In the case of California Sires Stakes 
races, the payment is made two years in advance. 
</P>
<P>
Cassini's horse, Typical Anna, finished seventh in a nine-horse field, 27 
lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Mandel, who argued the case for Los Alamitos, called Davies' decision 
"very well thought out and put together."

CRIME: THE SAN DIEGO BUSINESSMAN, FACING A TRIAL ON FEDERAL CHARGES OF MONEY

<P>
Two months before he is scheduled to stand trial on federal money-laundering 
charges, former state Democratic official Richard T. Silberman was reported 
missing Friday. He had told his family he was going to attend a dinner meeting 
Thursday night with an Orange County attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, his 1975, light-blue Mercedes-Benz was recovered in a parking lot at 
Lindbergh Field, where he last was seen Thursday evening waiting in line to 
purchase a ticket to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
He vanished at a time when he was facing multiple charges that, if he were 
convicted, would carry a maximum term of 75 years in prison and $2.75 million 
in fines. 
</P>
<P>
His disappearance came on the same day that an FBI report was released 
reporting that Silberman had confessed to the money laundering, saying he had 
done it to save his business. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old businessman, who was a top official in the administration of 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., left his La Jolla home about 4:30 p.m. Thursday, 
after telling family members that he was going to Orange County to have dinner 
and meet with an attorney there, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, told police that 
she spoke with the attorney Friday morning and learned that he had not seen her 
husband. Golding then alerted police. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to process the car, obviously, and then we'll be doing some 
follow-up investigation in terms of witnesses and so forth," San Diego Police 
Cmdr. Larry Gore said. "The car has been impounded, and we do know he was 
observed either purchasing a ticket or in the line for a ticket on USAir for a 
6 o'clock flight to Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's ultimate destination was unknown, but Carol Lam, an assistant U.S. 
attorney involved with the case, said court records showed that he was ordered 
to surrender his passport when he was released on $500,000 bail last April. 
However, it was unknown whether he actually had turned in the passport. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, before his car was discovered, Silberman's lawyers said they 
had no reason to think he was a fugitive. Instead, they said, they were worried 
for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
Gore, asked whether Silberman might have been trying to leave the country, 
said: "That's a scenario. But there are lots of scenarios. And it looks like 
we're going to be at this thing for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman also has faced financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
His company, Yuba Natural Resources, had been ailing before his arrest last 
April 7, and three days later he was replaced as executive officer. The company 
also was under siege in the civil courts, facing lawsuits from creditors and a 
$500,000 judgment from the federal government for mining for gold on land it 
did not own. 
</P>
<P>
Further, after his indictment, Silberman was not reappointed to his 
$40,000-a-year post on the California Medical Assistance Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing Friday morning in federal court here, prosecutors asked that 
Silberman's bond be forfeited because of the disappearance. U.S. District Judge 
J. Lawrence Irving rejected the request because not enough was known at that 
time about the disappearance. That was before Silberman's car was found. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed San Diego mobster Chris Petti and three other men are 
awaiting trial on seven felony counts of laundering $300,000 they allegedly 
believed were proceeds from illicit drug sales. The money was provided by a man 
who turned out to be an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
The charges shocked officials throughout the state, many of whom remembered 
Silberman for heading the state Business and Transportation Agency in 1977 
under Gov. Brown. He later was named finance director and, temporarily, chief 
of staff for the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
As the case has wound its way through federal court here, Silberman and his 
attorney, James Brosnahan, have contended that Silberman feared for his life 
because of his involvement with alleged mob figures in the undercover sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, Brosnahan claimed that Silberman was warned to "keep going" 
with the money-laundering scheme or he and his family would be killed. The 
lawyer said the threat was made by Robert Benjamin, an ex-convict turned 
government informant. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Brosnahan had sought to keep under wraps an FBI report of 
statements that Silberman allegedly gave to FBI agents when he was arrested. 
That report, released Friday, stated that Silberman confessed to federal agents 
that he had arranged to receive $300,000 of the bogus drug money and directed 
four men to help him launder it. 
</P>
<P>
The report said Silberman admitted participating in two deals to launder the 
money because he wanted to help his ailing Yuba gold mining company. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he knew the deals were "stupid," the report said, but he "wanted 
to avoid the humiliation that would have resulted if his company had gone 
under." 
</P>
<P>
Also in federal court Friday, Silberman's lawyers claimed that a mystery 
witness who testified last week in pretrial hearings had been shot at Tuesday 
near Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
While the witness -- identified in court only as Mr. X -- was driving Tuesday, 
four shots were fired at him from a person in a passing vehicle, lawyer George 
C. Harris said. None of the shots hit Mr. X, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal marshals reported back to Irving later Friday that Mr. X was not 
interested in their protection, Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gore, the police commander, said detectives first learned of Silberman's 
disappearance when Golding notified authorities that her husband never made the 
dinner meeting Thursday night in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Silberman left his home about 4:30 in La Jolla, then was seen 
about 5:05 p.m. Thursday by Andrea Ward-Sumida, an employee at RDF Advisors, a 
San Diego firm situated in the 5700 block of Oberlin Drive. The firm is owned 
by a personal friend of Silberman's, Ward-Sumida said Friday, and he often 
visited the offices. 
</P>
<P>
She added that she had no idea where he was going when he left the company 
suite, and she declined to discuss his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
"This has caught everybody off guard," she said. "There are a lot of emotions 
involved, and I'm just not at liberty to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Gore said that, after Silberman left the offices, he telephoned his daughter, 
Vanessa, from his car telephone. That was about 5:30 p.m., police said, adding 
that he then headed toward the airport to buy his ticket to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he had a destination past Los Angeles is not known. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder, the lead prosecutor, said Friday night that it was his understanding 
that Silberman was restricted only from leaving the United States. Asked 
whether he believes Silberman fled the country to avoid prosecution, Gorder 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a possibility, but I'll wait to see the results of the police 
investigation until I draw any conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
The official police missing-person report notes that Silberman was wearing a 
dark-blue, double-breasted coat, a blue tie with white dots, gray slacks and 
black shoes. The report lists his bank accounts as "numerous," the credit cards 
he carried as "numerous" and the reason he was missing as "unknown." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Golding could not be reached for comment Friday and spent most of 
the day inside her home with Brosnahan, who flew to San Diego from San 
Francisco. About 6 p.m. Friday, her father walked outside the gate of the home 
and told reporters that his daughter would have no statements about the 
disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
The police report made this notation: 
</P>
<P>
"Ms. Golding feels this is very unusual for her husband not to at least call 
her to tell her he would not be home for the evening." 
</P>

FBI SAYS SILBERMAN CONFESSED AFTER ARREST; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE BUREAU'S REPORT WAS RELEASED AFTER A FEDERAL APPELLATE COURT 
REJECTED A REQUEST FROM SILBERMAN'S LAWYERS TO KEEP IT SECRET.

Prominent San Diego businessman Richard T. Silberman confessed to FBI agents 
just after his arrest that he had arranged the receipt and laundering of 
$300,000 that he believed was drug money, according to an FBI report made 
public Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, indicted with four others on federal charges of money laundering, 
said he went through with two deals -- one for $100,000 and a second for 
$200,000 -- because he wanted to help his failing gold mining company, Yuba 
Natural Resources, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman told the agents that he knew the deals were "stupid," according to 
the report, but he "wanted to avoid the humiliation that would have resulted if 
his company had gone under." However, "Silberman said that he now realizes that 
there will be even more humiliation from his actions." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 60, was reported missing Friday, just hours before the seven-page 
report was made public. He was last seen Thursday at Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI narrative, detailing Silberman's behavior in the three hours 
immediately after he was arrested last April 7 in a Mission Bay hotel room, was 
released late Friday, after a federal appellate court rejected a request from 
Silberman's San Francisco lawyers to keep it secret. 
</P>
<P>
The report became accessible only after defense attorneys inadvertently filed 
it with legal briefs in December in downtown San Diego federal court. Documents 
filed with the court clerk are considered public record. 
</P>
<P>
However, only an edited version was released. U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence 
Irving ordered that the report could be released only after it was purged of 
references to other federal investigations or to people who were not involved 
in the FBI sting that led to Silberman's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
About a page and a half of the seven-page document was blank when issued. 
Lawyers in the case, quoted in other court documents, are reported to have said 
that Silberman volunteered information to the FBI about Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown, but what Silberman may have said about Brown has not been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Friday that Irving was right to 
order an edited version made public, saying Silberman's attorneys had failed to 
show that release of the report would prejudice his right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who is married to San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, is 
accused, along with reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other men, of 
laundering $300,000 that an undercover agent told Silberman was the proceeds of 
Colombian drug trafficking. Silberman is scheduled to begin trial April 10, 
while the other four are due to go to trial July 17. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that when Silberman, a powerful player in state and local 
Democratic politics for 15 years, was arrested, he was arranging to launder 
$1.1 million in funds portrayed to him as the proceeds of cocaine sales. The 
two transactions involving the $300,000 were to be test runs for the bigger 
deal, prosecutors say, and Silberman made little money from them. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Silberman was arrested, he was read his rights and signed a 
form in which he agreed to waive those rights, the FBI report says. For the 
next three hours, he talked to the agents, it says. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Silberman said he had known Petti about 15 years, 
having first met him at a barber shop at a Mission Valley hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Petti and Silberman had "no criminal association" until October, 1988, when 
Silberman "approached Petti about finding individuals who would be interested 
in moving cash out of the country, with no record, using his (Silberman's) gold 
mining ventures," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he made the request because he "had been having trouble raising 
investment capital from normal channels," the report says. He explained to 
Petti that "any investments in the gold-mining company could be done discreetly 
so as to conceal the source of the money and that, given time, the investment 
could be very profitable and could be cashed out in Canada with no records in 
the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
Petti said he would get back to Silberman and, a week or two later, met with 
him and Robert Benjamin, the report says. Benjamin was a government informant, 
prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
At that meeting -- no date is given in the report, but prosecutors have said it 
took place Nov. 9, 1988, at a Mission Valley hotel coffee shop -- Silberman 
went into further detail, the report says. There were shares in his gold mining 
company, held in banks in Switzerland, that he could obtain at a "reduced rate" 
and that could be sold to one of Benjamin's friends. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman discussed how the three of them could clear a profit selling the 
shares to "Benjamin's guy," according to the report. In turn, Benjamin's 
acquaintance could sell the shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"Benjamin's guy" turned out to be a man Silberman would know as "Pete 
Carmassi," who was actually undercover FBI agent Pete Ahearn. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said that, after he met Carmassi, he "became aware that the source of 
Carmassi's funds was from drug trafficking," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Still, prosecutors allege, Silberman went ahead with the first deal Nov. 30, 
1988, a $100,000 transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Naka, accompanied by Jack Myers, picked up the money at a Los Angeles 
Hilton, the report says. Prosecutors have said the money was picked up at the 
Airport Hilton in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Naka, 43, of West Los Angeles, whose real name is Darryl Nakatsuka, and Jack 
Myers, 42, of Beverly Hills, are two of the three other men indicted. 
</P>
<P>
The third is Terry Ziegler, 45, of Moorpark in Ventura County. Silberman said 
the $100,000 was sent to a bank account in Basel, Switzerland, wired by 
Ziegler, who was relaying instructions from Silberman through Myers, according 
to the report. 
</P>
<P>
After the cash was received in Switzerland, a 50,000-share stock certificate in 
Yuba American Gold Ltd., a Yuba Natural subsidiary, was mailed to his San Diego 
office, Silberman reportedly told the FBI agents. About $94,000 of the $100,000 
had actually been wired to Switzerland for the stock, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have contended that the money made its way to Switzerland only 
after being deposited in various amounts in Southern California banks and being 
wired first to Hong Kong. An undercover FBI agent eventually was given the 
stock certificate, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman told the FBI agents that he had never met Ziegler and knew of him 
only through Myers, according to the report. Myers was a "political fund-raiser 
who seemed to know everyone" and whom Silberman, a longtime Democratic Party 
fund-raiser, had known for years. 
</P>
<P>
The second transaction began Feb. 22, 1989, when Naka and Myers picked up 
$200,000, the report says. This deal was supposed to be a swap for U.S. 
Treasury bonds, prosecutors have said. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he received about $4,000 of that $200,000, according to the 
report. He paid Petti $6,500 for arranging the first deal, it says, giving it 
to him in two payments at a downtown San Diego coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said he never gave any money to Benjamin because he believed that 
Carmassi would pay him, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
There was a complication with the second deal, Silberman reportedly told the 
agents. Myers had originally said it would cost a point to sell the bonds and a 
point to buy them back, the report says. A point is usually 1% of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
But, after the money was delivered, Myers told him Ziegler had changed his fee 
and "wouldn't come up with the right number of bonds." 
</P>
<P>
After the problem came up, Silberman said, he told Myers the money was "coming 
from people in Colombia who were involved in drug trafficking," according to 
the report. Silberman also said he did not understand why Ziegler would "do 
something so stupid" as to not complete the deal as agreed. 
</P>
<P>
So, Silberman said, he turned to Petti, figuring that Ziegler "had swindled 
them" and there would be no further deals with Carmassi if the problem wasn't 
resolved, the report says. Petti, Silberman told the agents, "agreed to handle 
this matter in his own way." 
</P>
<P>
The report does not say if or how the matter was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
It concludes by detailing a phone call Silberman made to Golding near the end 
of the three-hour session, during which he "became distraught and expressed his 
sorrow and regret at having just been arrested by the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman "repeated to his wife several times that he . . . had gotten caught 
in a deal to raise money," the report says. And for the first time since he was 
arrested, it says, he asked for a lawyer, telling her to call one. 
</P>
<P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 HAWTHORNE MINISTERS OPPOSE LEGAL GAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by former Hawthorne Mayor Guy Hocker to legalize gambling in the 
city generated strong opposition this week when two Hawthorne ministers urged 
the City Council to reject the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Bruce Chamberlain of Hope Chapel and the Rev. Earl Thornton of Del Aire 
Assembly of God Church told the council that they oppose gambling because it 
can lead to other problems, such as higher crime rates, lower property values, 
and increases in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Chamberlain said the Ministerial Assn. of Hawthorne and Lawndale 
voted unanimously to oppose Hocker's plan. 
</P>
<P>
After the two ministers spoke, Hocker urged the council to place a measure on 
the ballot and allow voters to decide whether they want to legalize gambling. 
</P>
<P>
The council took no action on Hocker's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting last month, Hocker said gambling revenues could help the 
city pay for a proposal by Police Chief Stephen Port to hire 40 police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, the city passed three anti-gambling ordinances specifically 
prohibiting draw poker and other forms of gambling.

AS MERCURY FALLS, ARMY OF CROP PROTECTORS RISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when all farmers could do was talk about the weather. Nowadays 
many are doing something about it. 
</P>
<P>
Most growers head for their groves or fields when a freeze alert is issued by 
the National Weather Service. As the mercury drops into the 20s, heaters are 
fueled and lighted, sprinklers are turned on, and, when available, wind 
machines are employed to circulate air and break up pockets of cold that settle 
in low-lying areas. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the helicopter has entered the fight, providing mobile wind 
machines that hover above frost-threatened crops and prevent losses in the 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Ivor Shier, president of Corporate Helicopters, is a veteran in the cold 
control corps. He and his workers have spent two long nights this week in the 
Coachella Valley, herding warm air to grapevines and other valuable crops. 
Working about 75 feet up, they provide enough circulation to keep frost from 
settling but not enough to harm foliage or fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The job is exacting, stressful, tiring and boring, Shier acknowledged. Pilots 
must maneuver in the dark, watching for power poles, other helicopters and 
changes in temperature and altitude as well as listening to radio instructions 
from ground crews. 
</P>
<P>
From dark to dawn Wednesday and Thursday nights, 35 helicopter pilots worked to 
thwart arctic cold in the Coachella Valley, Shier said, and the cost was not 
low: about $7,000 per helicopter per night. 
</P>
<P>
"We think of ourselves as insurance policies and well worth it," Shier said. 
"Without us, they could have lost a crop worth a quarter of a million dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Snodgrass, county assistant agricultural commissioner, said the new 
methods of frost prevention all have hefty price tags. The cost of heating 
greenhouses, fueling wind machines and continuously pumping water through 
sprinklers on cold nights rises as the temperature falls, he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
The time-tested method of covering plants with burlap or plastic has recently 
been modernized in the form of a spray-on coating, an Evergreen Nursery 
spokesman said. Both methods seem to have protected the firm's stock from the 
record cold, he said, although damage may not appear for several days after a 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, bacterial applications that promise frost resistance for a variety 
of crops are now in the experimental stage. University of California 
agricultural extension specialists are working with the most recent frost- and 
freeze-protection method.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido couple indicted last May on charges of illegally smuggling exotic 
birds into the United States have pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Michael Daye, 40, who owns a pet store in Long Beach, pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy to import protected wildlife, which carries a maximum 
five-year term in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, his wife, Jane Daye, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
aiding and abetting transportation and receipt of protected wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge J. Lawrence Irving set sentencing for Michael Daye 
for Aug. 6. He remains free on a $250,000 personal surety bond. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of Jane Daye's attorney, Cindy Aaron, she was sentenced 
immediately to one year of probation with no jail time or fine. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Cynthia Millsaps said Jane Daye was a minor figure in the 
scheme, which included 10 other people, according to the grand jury indictment 
handed down May 31. Only three defendants in the case have not pleaded guilty, 
and their trial is set for April 17. 
</P>
<P>
The exotic birds came from Southeast Asia, Central and South America and 
Mexico. They included various types of cockatoos, parrots and macaws. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the species are so threatened with extinction that an international 
treaty has been signed by 97 nations that prohibits all trade with these birds, 
according to information supplied by the U.S. attorney's office. Some of the 
birds smuggled were valued at $8,000 to $10,000 each.

Two teen-agers were arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of a 
35-year-old man in Logan Heights early Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two officers were on patrol at 2 a.m. in the 3600 block of Main Street when 
witnesses told them a man had been shot in a nearby Vesta Street duplex, police 
spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses directed police to two teen-agers near Vesta and Dalbergia 
streets, where a 15- and a 17-year-old were arrested. One of the boys had a 
.22-caliber revolver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was found in a back bedroom of the residence in the 2000 block of 
Vesta Street, with a gunshot wound in his upper body, police said. He died an 
hour later at UC San Diego Medical Center. His identity was being withheld 
pending notification of relatives.

About 10,000 gallons of raw sewage spilled into Lake Murray on Friday after a 
sewer main backed up through a manhole at Cowles Mountain Boulevard and Navajo 
Road, San Diego County spokesman Gary Stephany said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 9 a.m. spill was caused by tree roots that blocked the sewer main, Stephany 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred at the far end of the Lake Murray Water Treatment Plant, and 
the plant's water intake was shut off "long before any contamination could 
enter the drinking water supply," Stephany said. "The spill poses no public 
health hazard."

A Soviet exhibition that was supposed to open Monday at the San Diego 
Convention Center has been delayed until Friday because a fire-extinguishing 
system in the special-events area failed to operate, said Donna Alm, a 
spokeswoman for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Wilkens, spokesman for the San Diego Unified Port District, said the city's 
contractor did not release the special-events area to the Convention Center 
because a water-cannon test failed to meet the Fire Department's standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The water cannon, which looks like the end of a firefighter's hose, did not 
shoot water the distance it was supposed to and in the sufficient amounts 
required by the city's Fire Department," Wilkens said. 
</P>
<P>
Alm said a steel-framed tent will be put up on a 17,000-square-foot parking lot 
behind the Marriott Hotel and Seaport Village for the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will include artwork, photographs and an audio-visual program about 
the Soviet Union. Fifty people accompanied the exhibition, which arrived in San 
Diego on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego display will be the third and final showing of the exhibition in 
the United States, Alm said.

FAN PUT TYSON, KING DOWN FOR THE COUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again the big-money people of boxing, the rich, the selfish money-hungry 
crooks are going into the gutter for the almighty dollar. They don't care about 
right or wrong or about Mike Tyson or Buster Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
All they care about is the money they are not going to make because of the 
outcome of this event. 
</P>
<P>
I love Mike Tyson. He is a great boxer and a fine man and he will probably win 
a rematch, but right is right and nobody has the right to take away what 
Douglas won. He beat Tyson badly and the people who control boxing don't like 
it because it costs them loads of money. 
</P>
<P>
The credibility of boxing is on the line once again because big money has been 
hit in the pocket book.

BISHOP MONTGOMERY HOLDS OFF BUENA PARK RALLY FOR 59-51 WIN

Buena Park cut a 19-point deficit in the first half to two, but still lost to 
Bishop Montgomery, 59-51, Friday night in the second round of the Southern 
Section 4-A playoffs at Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes (12-13) were led by sophomore center Gavin Molinar's 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Daniel had eight points in a 13-0 run that gave Bishop Montgomery 
(16-7) a 20-7 lead at the end of the first quarter. Daniel finished with 22. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park, which got 13 points from Ray Lanier, missed all nine of its 
free-throw attempts in the second quarter and trailed by 15 at halftime and by 
10 going into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coyotes scored the first six points of the fourth quarter to cut their 
deficit to 44-38. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Donyell Collins -- who was held to four points, six below 
his average -- brought Buena Park to 46-44 with 4:11 to play. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point basket by Kirk Jones 40 seconds later gave Bishop Montgomery a 
five-point lead, and the Coyotes never got closer than that down the stretch.

<P>
Bill Martineau had 20 points and 11 rebounds to lead Edison (19-8). Brandon 
Jessie added 16 points and seven rebounds. Agoura (14-9) was held to a 
season-low 14 rebounds.

"We felt like we were much stronger inside and that's where we went," Edison 
Coach Jon Borchert said. 
</P>
<P>
Edison led, 36-25, at halftime and the lead grew to 19 points after three 
minutes of the third quarter. During a 15-second span, Martineau had a 
spinning, one-handed slam and Jessie followed with a two-fisted jam.

SADDLEBACK'S QUICKNESS OVERCOMES MILLIKAN'S HEIGHT ADVANTAGE

<P>
Don't tell Saddleback High School Coach Pat Quinn that basketball is a game for 
big men, because his Roadrunners are short. 
</P>
<P>
But Quinn's players have quickness, and Millikan High School has the footprints 
on its back to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback (18-11) ran the Rams (20-8) out of the 5-AA playoffs Friday night 
with a 65-61 victory at Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the quick guy over the big guy," Quinn said, "The height 
disadvantage doesn't bother us, and the kids take it as a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback's front line, its average height less than 6-foot-3, looked up at 
Millikan's two 6-foot-5 forwards and two 6-foot-8 centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave away inches all over the place," Quinn said, "But our big guys played 
great tonight, and I was surprised that we were able to play a power game." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Jim Galbert had 13 points to go along nine rebounds and six steals, and 
center Marco Gomez added 10 points and a team-high 19 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback outrebounded the Rams, 49-41, and also made 24 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Andre MacFarlane had five steals and scored a game-high 23 points. 
MacFarlane's two layups following steals highlighted a 15-3 burst over the 
final 6 minutes 30 seconds of the second quarter to give Saddleback a 32-25 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback threatened to blow the game open starting the second half with eight 
unanswered points to build the lead to 50-33 at the end of three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
After Saddleback's switching defenses frustrated the Rams into shooting 25% 
from the field for the first three quarters, Millikan made its last gasp by 
outscoring the Roadrunners, 15-5, in the first 3:39 of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan employed its seldom-used press to force numerous Saddleback turnovers, 
sparking the Ram rally. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Thacker led the charge, scoring 12 of his team-high 17 points in the fourth 
quarter, but the team's 28-point final period wasn't enough.

Laguna Beach high School rolled past cold-shooting L.A. Baptist, 51-31, in a 
second-round 2-A playoff game Friday night at Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Baptist (9-15) scored only two field goals in the first half but made 11 
of 12 free throws to trail at halftime, 22-15. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists outscored L.A. Baptist, 29-16, in the second half to win going 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (20-5) failed to take advantage of L.A. Baptist's zone defense in 
the first half, according to Coach Ed Bowen. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't really playing very hard the first half," Bowen said. "I had to 
really shout at halftime and get mad (L.A. Baptist) wasn't really trying t win, 
they were just trying to keep the score down, and that frustrated our guys." 
</P>
<P>
The Artists' John Borella led all scorers with 13, Dain Blanton had 12 and John 
Trevino had 10. For L.A. Baptist, Glen Dodson had 11 and John Patton had five.

RETURN OF INJURED PLAYERS HELPS RANCHO ALAMITOS ROLL, 86-58

The return of Chris Singletary and David Green provided second-seeded Rancho 
Alamitos High School the emotional boost it needed and the Vaqueros soundly 
defeated South Pasadena, 86-58, in a 3-A second-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Singletary only played the last 26 seconds of the game at Rancho Alamitos. But 
it was his participation in the Vaqueros' basketball practice this week for the 
first time this season that inspired his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Singletary, who started for the Vaquero basketball team last year as a 
sophomore and started this season as the varsity quarterback, broke his left 
leg in two places in the first football game of the season. He had surgery and 
has been rehabilitating ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave the team quite a lift, him and David showing up for practice the same 
day," Vaquero Coach Eric Hamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Green, the Vaqueros' leading scorer at 16.7 points a game, dislocated the thumb 
on his shooting hand against Pacifica three games ago and had been sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
In his first game back Friday, he scored 12 points on four of eight shooting, 
grabbed 10 rebounds and had five steals. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos (20-4) had a poor shooting night at 41%, but South Pasadena was 
worse, shooting 31% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to the game was outside shooting," Tiger Coach Jeff Klein said. "The 
guys we needed to hit just weren't hitting." In addition, the Tigers were not 
able to get the ball inside to 6-6 center Paul Perkins, who finished with nine 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos' full-court pressure wore down the Tigers (13-11), but it was 
on the offensive boards where the Vaqueros took control of the game in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos outscored South Pasadena, 21-16, in the third quarter and 33-16 
in the fourth, mostly on follow shots. South Pasadena managed only two field 
goals in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos played all 15 players, 11 of whom scored. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of guys coming off the bench with fresh legs and that's what we 
told them, 'Go in and board,' Hamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vaqueros needed those offensive rebounds, because though they kept putting 
up three-point shots, they didn't make many. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Preuss led the way with 23 points, hitting four of 12 three-point shots. 
Richard Pearce scored 12 points, but he hit only two of 10 three-point 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have such confidence in our shooters, we never told them not to shoot," 
Hamamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Eric Moore was the sole Vaquero consistently on the mark. He shot 75% 
and scored 14 points, eight of them on four of four shooting in the third 
quarter.

CORONA DEL MAR WINS WITH A FLURRY

<P>
The points kept coming at such a furious pace that Corona del Mar High School 
forward Warren Johnson didn't even have time to check the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
Clinging to a 35-34 third-quarter lead against St. Paul in a second-round 3-A 
playoff game Friday, Corona del Mar began scoring in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
The streak of consecutive points reached 19, and Corona del Mar (17-9), the 3-A 
runner-up last year, went on to a 77-60 victory in its home gym. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem like 19 points," said Johnson, who scored eight points during 
the decisive third quarter. "We were all just playing, and I looked up at the 
scoreboard and all of a sudden we were up by 20 points. It was kind of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Easy for Johnson to say. But for St. Paul (7-16), which had to endure the 5 
1/2-minute stretch, it spelled the end of a season. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got stuck on 34," St. Paul Coach Mike Dinneen said. "We came out after 
halftime well, then we missed a layup at 39-34 and we just couldn't stop the 
tide. They kept getting layup after layup." 
</P>
<P>
The second half started innocently enough. After trailing, 33-25, at halftime, 
St. Paul cut its deficit to 35-34 on a three-pointer by Brandon Ertle with six 
minutes left in the quarter. St. Paul, after overcoming poor shooting from the 
field (7 of 24) and foul trouble for leading scorer Edgar Diaz in the opening 
half, seemed to have the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
But thanks to Corona del Mar's press and subsequent turnovers, the Swordsmen 
would score only two points the rest of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a 6-foot-2 senior, started Corona del Mar's run with two consecutive 
baskets. Jeff Jackson then took his turn, scoring the next two field goals. 
Later, Johnson added four more points on consecutive layups. After another 
field goal gave the Sea Kings a 54-34 lead, Mark Walsh made two free throws to 
end St. Paul's scoreless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris seemed at a loss for words to describe the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"You get it going and it just happens," he said. "We threw a little pressure at 
them and they got a little nervous. You start forcing a couple of turnovers and 
it just explodes. Our defense just kept getting better and better." 
</P>
<P>
John Paulsen scored a game-high 18 points and Jon Upham added 10 for the Sea 
Kings, who had a first-round bye. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Walsh paced St. Paul with 10 points. Diaz, averaging 14.5 points a game, 
spent much of the first half on the bench because of foul trouble and finished 
with seven points.

FOOTHILL UPSETS TRABUCO HILLS, 2-0

Capitalizing on teamwork, tough defense and perhaps its underdog status, the 
Foothill High School girls' soccer team toppled Trabuco Hills, 2-0, in a 
first-round 3-A playoff match Friday afternoon at Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (9-11-1), the third-place team in the Century League, scored two goals 
midway through the first half, then managed to keep Trabuco Hills (18-5-1) from 
scoring despite being outshot, 16-3, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole intent was to take the game to them from the beginning, and we did 
that in the first half," Foothill Coach Don Augustine said. "They came back in 
the second half, but we held them. We had some lucky breaks, too. But hey, we 
played hard as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Especially at the start, which might have been the greatest difference in the 
game. Unlike Foothill, Trabuco Hills, the Pacific Coast League champion and the 
fifth-seeded team in the 3-A division, seemed to come out a bit slow. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill took a 1-0 lead when captain Kathy Shortall fired in a left-footed 
free kick from 30 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Julie Borden scored Foothill's second goal from inside the penalty 
box, despite the presence of several defenders, giving the Knights a 2-0 lead 
going into halftime. 
</P>
<P>
While Trabuco Hills dominated the second half, Foothill held strong, especially 
in the game's final 10 minutes. Trabuco Hills had several shots on goal, most 
of which were just inches away from scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Foothill goalkeeper Michelle Webb, who had 22 saves, halfback 
Melanie Madole was praised by Augustine for defending Trabuco Hills' top 
player, Linda Lunceford. Lunceford, a senior, is the county's second-leading 
scorer this season with 31 goals. 
</P>
<P>
"This was my first time ever (guarding Lunceford)," Madole said. "I heard she 
was the No. 1 (actually No. 2) scorer in the county, so it made me a little 
nervous. But it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. She probably had an 
off day." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills Coach Mike Flanegian called it an off day for his entire team. 
</P>
<P>
"If we played them again tomorrow, we'd win," Flanegian said. "If we played 
them again next week, we'd win. If we played them again next month, we'd win. 
This was an upset." 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A matches: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 3, Kennedy 2 -- Monica Shrout scored in overtime for visiting 
Laguna Hills (12-10-3). Kelly Besser and Crista Capshaw scored the other goals 
for Laguna Hills and Claudia Smedes had all three assists. Kennedy ends at 
15-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 2, Bishop Montgomery 1 (OT) -- Stacey Reynaga scored in overtime for 
La Quinta (16-3-1). Cheryl Jones scored in regulation for La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge 1, Moreno Valley 0 -- Lori Niles scored the game's only goal with an 
assist from Tina Hall 12 minutes into the second half. Woodbridge is 13-5-2. 
Moreno is 16-6-4. Michelle Helring had the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands 3, Sunny Hills 1 (OT) -- Kelly Ward scored 77 minutes into the match 
to tie it for host Sunny Hills (14-3-5). Redlands (13-4-6) scored once in each 
overtime for the victory.

<P>
Jose Escobedo made 10 saves as Anaheim High School defeated Woodbridge, 2-0, in 
a 2-A soccer match Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Escobedo received plenty of help, however. Three times, a Woodbridge shot got 
past Escobedo and appeared to be heading for the goal, but twice an Anaheim 
field player knocked the ball away and one ball hit the goal post. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim (10-3-4) scored after the first near goal by Woodbridge late in the 
first half. Jeff Helig of Woodbridge slipped a shot past Escobedo, but Marco 
Alfaro kicked the ball away less than a foot from the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
On the transition, Ramon Camacho passed the ball to Mike Tsarnas, who broke 
free downfield and scored his 23rd goal of the season. In less than a minute, 
the Colonists had dodged a goal and scored another. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we were lucky," Anaheim Coach Adrian Carrasco said. "We were 
playing a fast-break game. That's how we got the goal. We escaped their mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was the turn-around point because (afterwards) they started to 
get desperate and make a lot of mistakes. They didn't pass as well after that." 
</P>
<P>
Tsarnas' goal came on a rare opportunity for the Colonists. Woodbridge 
(10-9-2), a bigger, more physical team, took 11 shots while Anaheim got only 
five, but the Warriors couldn't break through. 
</P>
<P>
With about seven minutes to play, Alex Perez scored to give Anaheim a two-goal 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had many chances," Woodbridge Coach Clyde Best said. "We were able to break 
down their defense. The ball just wouldn't go into the net." 
</P>
<P>
In other 2-A matches: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda 1, Bonita 0 -- Jayson Ochs scored 20 minutes into the first half 
for host Brea Olinda (15-7-2). Jeff Bettencourt had five saves for Brea. Bonita 
ends, 6-12-6. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A: 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 2, Santa Monica 1 -- After four overtime periods, host Mater Dei 
(16-6-3) won the shoot out, 4-2. Tom Evans had two saves in the shootout for 
Mater Dei, which has 14 consecutive victories. Chris Campbell scored 10 minutes 
into the second half to tie the score. Santa Monica's Todd Fite scored 20 
minutes into the first half. Evans had 10 saves and Phillip Marchis had 14 
saves for Santa Monica (16-10-2). Kevin Taugher, Richard Mills, Joe Nay and 
Shawn Gallagher scored in the shootout for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 2, Hawthorne 0 -- Greg Biggins scored 17 minutes into the match and 
Jed Smith scored 12 minutes into the second half for visiting Ocean View 
(15-4-5). Hawthorne finished 19-3-6. Seventh-seeded Ocean View outshot 
fourth-seeded Hawthorne, 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
In 2-A: 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 2, Kennedy 1 -- Brian Slayback scored the winning goal with 10 
minutes left. Joseph Rodriguez scored seven minutes into the game for visiting 
Kennedy, Scott Clark tied the score seven minutes into the second half on a 
cross pass from Slayback. It was Clark's 16th goal of the year for Laguna Hills 
(20-5). Kennedy goalie Sean O'Keefe had 18 saves for Kennedy (11-8). Chad 
Davidson had five saves for Laguna Hills.

GOLF: HALL OF FAMER'S GRANDSON REPEATS HIS OPENING ROUND 66 AND PUTS HIMSELF IN

Carrying one of the more famous names in golf history doesn't faze Tommy Armour 
III. 
</P>
<P>
Armour, 30, whose grandfather is a charter member of the PGA Hall of Fame, just 
wants to make it big on his own. He has had a struggle that dates back nine 
years, but may finally be headed in that direction. He scored his first PGA 
Tour victory in the Phoenix Open three weeks ago, and is hot on the trail of 
another in the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
Displaying remarkable consistency. Armour followed his 66 in Thursday's first 
round on the North course with another 66 Friday on the more challenging South 
course. His 36-hole total of 132 is good for third place, two strokes behind 
leader Bob Eastwood and one behind runnerup Dan Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his heritage had saddled him with extra pressure, Armour said, "Not at 
all. I don't try to work on emulation. Whatever I do, I do on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Armour Sr., who died in 1968, won the United States Open in 1927, the PGA 
in 1930, the British Open in 1931, and 24 tournaments in all. He was inducted 
into the Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1940, along with such legendary 
golfers as Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen. 
</P>
<P>
There is little if any physical resemblance between the senior Armour and 
Armour No. 3. Tommy Sr. was pencil-thin, and when he turned gray at a 
relatively early age, he was nicknamed the Silver Scot. Tommy III is a husky 
6-feet-2 and 210 pounds, and has a thick thatch of dark hair. 
</P>
<P>
As a golfer, though, Tommy III, an alumnus of the University of New Mexico, has 
inherited at least a modicum of the ability that made his grandfather a Hall of 
Famer. And, of course, he uses the same brand of clubs -- Tommy Armour. 
</P>
<P>
The middle Armour, Tommy Jr., 68, didn't follow his father into competitive 
golf, although he probably could have done so. He was a two-handicap player at 
one time. Instead, he went into medicine, and is now a surgeon in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
But the third generation Armour has put the family name back into golf, albeit 
in the face of much adversity. He turned pro in 1981, then had such a bad 
rookie season in 1982 that he lost his tour card. It took him five years to get 
the card back, and even then he earned a mere $970 in 1987. That was good for 
290th place on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
After that, however, Armour earned $175,461 in 1988 and $185,018 last year, and 
he already has pocketed $154,589 in 1990. If he wins this tournament and 
Escondido's Mark O'Meara finishes no better than third, he will jump from sixth 
place to first. Paul Azinger, the money leader, who won the Tournament of 
Champions at La Costa, is not playing here. 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara matched Armour's 66 on opening day, but skidded to a 74 Friday and 
plunged from a tie for third place to a tie for 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
There was a touch of irony in O'Meara's bad round. He had shot his 66 Thursday 
despite a sore neck, and before that had weathered a back problem to tie for 
third in the Tournament of Champions and a severe cold to win the AT&amp;T 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
"This time I felt good but played poorly," O'Meara said. 
</P>
<P>
Armour, meanwhile, defied the theory that the South course is two or three 
strokes tougher than the North. His second successive six-under-par round 
included five birdies, one bogey and an eagle on the par-5 fifth hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I played pretty steady, like yesterday," he said. "I stuck with my game plan 
and didn't try to do too much. I didn't have any long putts, but I didn't need 
any. I just played good, solid golf." 
</P>
<P>
Now cast as a prime contender, Armour was asked if he could smell his second 
tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about winning the tournament," he said. "I just want to play 
well enough tomorrow so I get to the 18th green Sunday with a chance to win."

AFTER MEYERS' KICK START HE GEARS FOR OLYMPICS; 
</P>
<P>
BICYCLING: HIS LEISURELY ACTIVITY HAS TURNED INTO A GOAL OF GREATNESS.

<P>
When Dean Meyers first bought a bicycle, it was to be used for those leisurely 
afternoon rides. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers was working in a grocery store in Monterey at the time. A fellow 
employee was training for triathlons and invited Meyers to ride with him. 
Before Meyers knew it, his lesiurely rides had turned into intense training 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd come back to work and say, 'I'm kicking Dean's butt everyday,' " Meyers 
said. "So I start training, mostly just to beat him. We joke about it, but he'd 
get me up at 7 o'clock every morning and just go out and kill me. I'd come home 
so tired, but I got really strong because of that and because I rode with 
someone so much better than me." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Meyers was the one bragging at the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while I was beating him, and then from there I started setting my 
scopes bigger and bigger," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
That was four years ago. Now a senior at San Diego State and a member of the 
school's cycling club, Meyers will be one of the top competitors in SDSU's 
Cycling Classic today and Sunday. Meyers is the favorite in today's Men's A 
46.5 mile road race in Jamul. But he will not race in Sunday's criterium on the 
SDSU campus due to previous commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at the collegiate nationals, Meyers placed 15th in the criterium, 
which is approximately 40 miles. This year Meyers' goal is to win the 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Collegiate cycling, however, is not Meyers' main focus. He's setting his sights 
first on the Olympics, then on riding for a professional racing team. Meyers 
now rides for both SDSU's club and the San Diego Bicycle Club, both of which 
are sanctioned by the U.S. Cycling Federation. Riding for the San Diego club, 
he can keep his prize money and still retain his amateur status, which is vital 
to his Olympic goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Collegiate racing is fun and it's prestigious for what it is but if you want 
to make it to the top you got to get out there with the U.S. Cycling 
Federation," Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to collegiate and USCF racing, Meyers was asked to be on a team to 
race mountain bikes. The team is sponsored by Nishiki through a shop in 
Monterey called Les Joselyns Bike Shop. 
</P>
<P>
"With NORBA (Northern Off Road Biking Assn.) I'll do a lot of traveling all 
over the country, and the races won't conflict with USCF," Meyers said. "They 
wouldn't do that because it would be detrimental to both businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said many cyclists do both road and off-road racing. Off-road, Meyers 
said has a lot more bike handling. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said one of the best ways for him to improve as a cyclist is to ride 
with a better cyclist. And fortunately for Meyers, he has two right under his 
roof. Roommates Steve and Trent Klasna provide Meyers with tough competition. 
Steve, a member of Team Reebok, is "one of the top riders in the country," 
Meyers said. And Steve's brother, Trent, who rides with the San Diego Bicycle 
Club also "pushes" Meyers when training. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers and Trent Klasna recently returned from Colorado Springs where they 
attended a three-week camp in which 55 of the top amateur cyclists in the 
country trained under the national coaches. They were selected for the camp 
based on their cycling accomplishments over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for them to get a look at us and for us to see what the 
system is at that level," Meyers said. "It's kind of preparatory for the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Each day of the strenuous camp began at 7 a.m. with training on stationary 
bikes for an hour. After breakfast they would go on a 70-mile bike ride, which 
Meyers said was often difficult because the temperatures would drop to five or 
10 degrees, and often below zero. Later, the cyclists would go out to the 
soccer field for running, then to the pool, then more riding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good base for the rest of the season," Meyers said. "You come out 
of there really tired because they work you so hard. Right now I'm starting to 
feel what I went through there and feel myself getting stronger." 
</P>
<P>
The camp gave Meyers the opportunity to meet the coaches, so it put him one 
step closer to his Olympic goal. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us to keep in contact," Meyers said. "They want to know what we're 
doing. If I keep in touch and have a successful season, they might invite me 
back to a camp next year which is just another step." 
</P>
<P>
Meyers said the team is usually chosen about two weeks before the Olympics 
because "they want a team riding strong at that time." 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to keep monitoring all the people they're in contact with up 
until the last minute," Meyers said. "I have all of this year and next year so 
I have as good of a chance as any. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to shoot for the top but it's too early to say I want to win the Tour 
de France. I can say it and its true, but I need a couple more seasons to say 
it with validity."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS HEAD INTO BREAK PONDERING MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Ron Newman said there is a good chance the struggling Sockers will make a 
trade sometime between the Major Indoor Soccer League's owners meetings Monday 
and Tuesday and the league's all-star game on Wednesday. Both the meetings and 
the game will be held in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Newman and Socker President Ron Cady said a number of players are being 
considered, including Tacoma midfielder David Hoggan. Cady, however, said a 
Hoggan trade is unlikely from a public relations standpoint. Hoggan, who 
head-butted former Socker Hugo Perez two seasons ago, causing Perez to lose a 
tooth, was given a 30-day suspension by Star Coach Keith Weller earlier this 
week for leaving the team during a game. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not the kind of attitude we condone," Cady said. "I'd be greatly 
surprised if he's here by the end of (the all-star week)." 
</P>
<P>
According to Socker Owner Ron Fowler, the team will consider trading forward 
Damir Haramina, who hasn't suited up for nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Damir is available if the right deal could be made," Fowler said. "He 
hasn't demonstrated the intensity that we would like to see. At this point in 
the season, with our record, you run out of patience." DON PATTERSON

AGENCY ORDERS NORDSTROM TO PAY BACK WAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Washington Department of Labor and Industries has found the Nordstrom 
department store chain in violation of the state's minimum wage act, 
vindicating a union's complaint that the company requires salespeople to work 
"off the clock" to make good on its pledge of superb customer service. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling that carried no punitive fine but that is likely to cost the 
company in terms of public relations, the state on Thursday night ordered 
Nordstrom to pay a yet-to-be-determined amount of back wages to all affected 
employees and to "properly compensate" them in the future for such tasks as 
attending employee meetings, making home deliveries and writing thank-you notes 
to customers. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling affects workers only in Washington, where the department has the 
option of turning its violation report over to county prosecutors or filing its 
own lawsuit against Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
The state acted in response to a complaint by the United Food and Commercial 
Workers Union, which represents 2,000 Nordstrom employees in the Seattle area. 
The union, echoing complaints that have surfaced throughout Nordstrom's 
30,000-member U.S. work force, alleged that managers coerced employees into not 
charging the company for hundreds of hours a year that many of them worked. 
</P>
<P>
Times interviews with numerous employees indicated that Nordstrom's emphasis on 
salespeople's "sales-per-hour" ratio indirectly encouraged many employees to 
voluntarily "punch out" before performing some non-sales, customer-service 
activities. "Punching in" for those hours would lower the sales-per-hour ratio. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom officials, who have consistently denied that they have a policy of 
ordering off-the-clock work, said in response to the state report that they 
will "fully comply with the law." A statement released by co-chairman Bruce 
Nordstrom neither quarreled with the ruling nor admitted wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"We will review the mechanics of our record-keeping procedures in light of this 
report to see where they need to be improved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington ruling bolsters plans by the union, in cooperation with a San 
Francisco attorney, to file a class-action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of 
current and former Nordstrom employees. The union says it has so far received 
claims for $2 million from about 400 workers in Washington and California, 
where Nordstrom employees are not unionized. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Peterson, president of Local 1001 of the commercial workers union in 
Seattle, said the state ruling "demonstrates clearly that the company has 
operated under a system that is inherently illegal. They are going to have to 
change. They can continue to provide good customer service but it's going to 
cost them a lot more in terms of their labor costs." 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom stock fell $3.25 Friday to $29.50 but the drop was attributed to an 
announcement made after the stock market closed Thursday that the company 
expects a lower fourth-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
The state found that in several cases Nordstrom was violating its own written 
policies that require compensating employees for all time worked. While written 
policy states, for instance, that delivering merchandise to customers' homes is 
to be performed during regular work hours, the company told state investigators 
that such work is "generally performed before or after the scheduled workday or 
on the employee's day off." The state found that mileage vouchers indicated 
reimbursement for travel on days for which time cards indicated no hours 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom also faces a National Labor Relations Board complaint in Seattle 
stemming from the company's alleged failure to provide documents needed in 
contract negotiations with the union.

ALL EYES ARE ON MICHAEL MILKEN AFTER DREXEL'S BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the sudden demise this week of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the last important 
plot element still to be worked out in this Wall Street tragedy is the fate of 
the firm's former junk bond chief, Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are that federal prosecutors have become eager, perhaps desperate, 
to settle the mammoth criminal case pending against Milken. But the collapse of 
Drexel after a bankruptcy filing by its parent company on Tuesday may make 
Milken less willing to plead guilty and thus be seen to accept blame for a 
debacle that ruined his old firm and threw thousands of former colleagues out 
of work, people associated with the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken, through his creative use of the high-yield, high-risk bonds, was 
largely responsible for the huge success that Drexel enjoyed in the 1980s. "If 
he pleads guilty, he's going to have to bear the mark of the guy who took 
Drexel down," a lawyer involved in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Milken strongly denies violating any laws. But complicating his position are 
family pressures, stemming from the fact that his brother, Lowell, is also 
under indictment. Any plea agreement presumably would include at least reduced 
charges against Lowell, and possibly the dropping of charges altogether. And 
Michael Milken's chances of acquittal in a trial have been damaged by the fact 
that many of his former close associates at Drexel have agreed to testify 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lawyers and federal prosecutors are keeping the status of negotiations 
a closely held secret. Until a few weeks ago, the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
Manhattan was threatening finally to bring a long-promised new indictment in 
the case. It would replace the 98-count racketeering and securities fraud 
indictment pending since last March against Milken, his brother Lowell and a 
former Drexel trader. It would contain additional charges and name more 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Deadlines were set and then pushed back. And now, suddenly, there is eerie 
silence. The government is still officially committed to bringing a new 
indictment, but at least outwardly nothing is happening. Prosecutors have 
stopped predicting to defense attorneys when it will be filed. "It just seems 
to have drifted off into never-never land," another lawyer in the case said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say both sides have held talks about the possibility of Milken's 
pleading guilty to perhaps five felony counts. Thorny issues include the 
charges against Lowell, the amount of the substantial financial penalty Milken 
inevitably will have to pay, and whether the government will give up its demand 
that Milken testify against others. The two sides then retreated to their 
respective camps to consider each other's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Milken refused to confirm that any talks have been held at all. 
He also refused to speculate on how the collapse of Drexel might affect the 
outcome of the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors also refused to comment about developments this week. 
</P>
<P>
But former prosecutors as well as private lawyers associated with the case say 
there is mounting evidence that the government wants to settle. The strongest 
indication they point to is that although the government completed preparation 
for the new indictment at least two months ago, it hasn't filed. If the 
government was fully committed to going forward with the case, prosecutors 
could simply have made a final offer to Milken's lawyers and set a final 
deadline for filing the new indictment. 
</P>
<P>
Former colleagues of the two assistant U.S. attorneys handling the case, John 
Carroll and Jess Fardella, say there are a variety of reasons for wanting to 
settle, not the least of which are personal. After doing virtually nothing else 
for the last three years, the two prosecutors are said to be tired and eager to 
bring the case to an end. Former colleagues say Carroll has let it be known for 
at least a year that he wants to leave the U.S. Attorney's Office and go into 
private practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think these guys are ready to move on with their lives," one former 
prosecutor said. If a new indictment is brought, the pretrial phase of the case 
could drag on for another year, followed by a trial that would last for months. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone conversation on Friday, Carroll said: "I will stay through 
the conclusion of the case, whether it ends tomorrow or three years from now." 
He refused to say if he is eager to leave the U.S. Attorney's office. "My 
personal druthers are irrelevant" to the handling of the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are all the usual reasons why prosecutors want to settle 
cases: An acceptable plea agreement is often a better alternative to a lengthy, 
costly trial that the government could lose. Legal experts say that even if 
Milken ultimately is convicted of numerous felony counts, his sentence probably 
wouldn't be much more severe than what he would get if he pleads guilty to just 
a few felony counts. "He's probably still going to jail for the same amount of 
time," one lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, prosecutors may be concerned that some of the blame for the collapse 
of Drexel is falling on them. Drexel and Milken were prosecuted in the belief 
that Milken's junk bond operation in Beverly Hills had repeatedly violated 
securities laws by engaging in insider trading, stock market manipulation and 
securities fraud. The pro-business Wall Street Journal editorial page, and 
other critics, have argued that the firm was driven out of business by the 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
These critics charge that the government unfairly made use of its RICO weapon 
-- the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- as a bludgeon to 
force the firm into pleading guilty to lesser counts last year. As a result, 
these critics argued, Drexel went into an inexorable slide when it lost its 
good reputation and was subjected to severe penalties without a chance to clear 
its name in court. 
</P>
<P>
By getting Milken to agree to plead guilty to several substantial counts, 
prosecutors would be better able to refute such claims. "As long as he 
maintains his innocence, there is lingering doubt that Drexel was more afraid 
of a RICO indictment and may not have been guilty of all these crimes," one 
private defense lawyer in New York said. 
</P>
<P>
The actual prosecution of the case may be made somewhat more difficult by 
Drexel's demise. Under the firm's settlement of a Securities and Exchange 
Commission lawsuit, Drexel and its employees were required to cooperate with 
prosecutors, including supplying trading and other records. With Drexel closed 
up and employees dispersed, such easy access to records and recollections 
probably will lapse. But lawyers close to the case say the government already 
has such a voluminous collection of records that this probably wouldn't be a 
crucial handicap in a trial.

FARWEST HIT WITH $23-MILLION JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FarWest Savings &amp; Loan, already weakened by the slumping junk bond market, 
has been hit with a $23-million verdict in a major lender liability lawsuit 
heard in a Colorado state district court. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment is one of the largest ever in a lender liability case. The damages 
were assessed by a Denver jury, which ruled that the Newport Beach-based thrift 
unfairly withdrew a line of credit three years ago from Alpert Cos., a Colorado 
builder and developer. 
</P>
<P>
The builders contended during a 10-day trial that ended late Thursday that it 
lost a chance to pick up 1,000 acres of prime land when the S&amp;L prematurely 
cut off its line of credit in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
While most large verdicts include punitive damages, the judgment against 
FarWest -- whose parent is majority-owned by the wealthy Belzberg brothers in 
Canada -- consists of compensatory damages only. 
</P>
<P>
"They left Alpert high and dry," said Michael Sheldon, Alpert's trial lawyer. 
"We felt they were carpetbaggers. They came in from out of state in 1984 and 
made long-term commitments. When the market turned, they pulled out and didn't 
care who they hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The jury's decision will be appealed, said Kurt C. Kemper, general counsel for 
the S&amp;L's parent firm, FarWest Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a pasting. It was horrendous," Kemper said. "But we believe the 
verdict was incorrect in fact and in law." 
</P>
<P>
Alpert had a five-year line of credit that was to be renewed automatically each 
year, Sheldon said. The company had an option to purchase land each year and 
needed the funding to do that, he said. The loan was renewed in 1985 and 1986, 
but the S&amp;L decided to pull out of the slumping Denver and Texas markets in 
1987, he said. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest claims it determined that it was too risky to continue to lend money to 
Alpert. Kemper said the only issue before the court was the proper procedure 
for approving or denying the annual renewal option. It is uncertain if FarWest 
or its parent will have to set any money aside while it appeals the decision. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of September, the company had 13.9% of its $4.7 billion in assets in 
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. The new federal thrift law adopted by 
Congress last August requires thrifts to sell their junk bond portfolios within 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market, meantime, has been taking a beating and has led to the 
collapse of Drexel.

METROMEDIA IS IN TALKS TO SELL ITS 70% ORION STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metromedia Co., which is controlled by investor John Kluge, confirmed Friday 
that is in "extremely preliminary" talks with several potential buyers of its 
70% stake in Orion Pictures Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Metromedia didn't identify the potential buyers, though recent published 
reports have said Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis was among them. 
</P>
<P>
Davis didn't return a call seeking comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Orion shares closed Friday at $22.50, up 75 cents, as 117,900 shares changed 
hands in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Orion had said it didn't know of any corporate development that 
would account for a $2.875 jump in its stock price that day. 
</P>
<P>
Orion captured only about 4.2% of the domestic box office in 1989 -- down from 
6.6% in 1988 and 10.4% in 1987 -- and has been plagued by repeated rumors of a 
pending management shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
An Orion spokeswoman said she wasn't aware of any major changes in company 
management.

AETNA PRAISES $18-MILLION HEALTH-CARE FRAUD JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aetna Life Insurance Co. says the $18 million that a federal judge awarded to 
it and two other health insurance carriers on Thursday was the largest 
health-care fraud judgment ever secured under the federal Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). 
</P>
<P>
But Aetna acknowledged that the hard part will be getting its hands on the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The award came in a civil lawsuit that accused two brothers of operating a 
string of Los Angeles-based mobile medical diagnostic laboratories that filed 
fraudulent claims totaling more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of the brothers, David Smushkevich, was found guilty in 1987 of criminal 
violations of the anti-kickback provisions of federal laws governing the 
Medicare program. He served time in prison. He and his brother Michael -- also 
named in the suit -- left the country after the insurers' suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors also tried and convicted several others who were said to 
have been involved in various schemes to refer patients to the Smushkevichs' 
labs in exchange for payments. In the criminal proceedings, witnesses claimed 
that the labs not only filed exorbitant bills with Medicare and private 
insurers, but often didn't give patients test results. 
</P>
<P>
The Smushkevich brothers operated about 240 labs under a variety of names, 
including American Diagnostics Inc., Alpha Medical and American Cardiology 
Diagnostic Clinic, according to the civil suit. Aetna claimed that the brothers 
were engaged in the most massive health-care fraud in the history of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Hyfield-Starr, an Aetna spokeswoman, said the insurance companies 
realize that they will have difficulty collecting the default judgment. The 
Smushkevichs filed bankruptcy and liquidated their companies before they left 
the country, she said. One of the brothers is in Russia and the other -- it 
isn't certain which of the two -- is believed to be in Mexico, she said. The 
Smushkevichs were Russian emigres in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hyfield-Starr said the company believes that it may be able to collect some of 
the judgment if it traces the brother in Mexico. "I imagine it's going to be 
quite difficult," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Aetna said it was still pleased with the court judgment. "One reason 
health costs are going up is fraud and Aetna wants to send a clear message that 
it is aggressively pursuing fraud claims," said James L. Garcia, director of 
fraud investigations for Aetna's Employee Benefits division. "Health insurance 
fraud in this country is an over $60-billion-a-year problem that every one of 
us pays for in higher health-care costs."

Garcia said Aetna wants the federal government to enact laws specifically for 
health-care fraud so that insurance scam operators would be more readily 
subject to criminal prosecution. Hyfield-Starr said most health insurance 
criminal fraud cases are brought under mail fraud statutes because claims are 
processed through the postal service. But, she said, there are so many other 
crimes that come under the postal laws and RICO that "white collar" crimes like 
health insurance fraud get pushed to "the bottom of the list." 
</P>
<P>
"Although we feel good about the civil judgment, health-care fraud continues to 
grow and the public should be aware of this. Copy-cat scams are springing up in 
other states," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Shield of California said recently that "rolling lab" operations still 
engage in fraud in California. The insurer said it discovered $1.5 million in 
fraudulent claims in 1989. "One of the biggest rip-offs has been the vast 
number of falsely filed claims from shady 'rolling lab' operators that continue 
to bilk the public," said Harry S. Miller, Blue Shield vice president for 
consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said Blue Shield is working closely with the Internal Revenue Service, 
the postal service and law enforcement agencies to prosecute fraudulent 
operators.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: PICK THE RIGHT PERSON TO DO YOUR TAX RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
So you've looked at that 1040 and thrown up your arms in disgust. No way can 
you complete the thing by yourself, you conclude. 
</P>
<P>
But finding a good tax preparer isn't a snap either. There are different kinds 
of preparers with different skills and fees. Some are not well qualified. 
Others may be out-and-out shysters. Just like Medflies, unscrupulous tax 
preparers keep popping up all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody can call themselves a tax preparer, and unfortunately a lot of 
anybodys do become tax preparers during part of the year," says Julian Block, a 
Larchmont, N.Y., attorney and tax expert. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some basic steps for selecting a preparer: 
</P>
<P>
* Decide if you really need one at all. If your itemized deductions don't go 
much beyond mortgage interest, or you don't have much non-wage income, the 
bookstore tax guides or the Internal Revenue Service's free Publication 17 can 
probably do the job. 
</P>
<P>
Also consider adult education classes or seminars given at community colleges, 
churches or community centers. Call the IRS at (800) 424-1040 for information 
on free tax-preparation seminars offered primarily for elderly, low-income or 
small-business taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for doing it yourself: It's harder to deduct tax-preparation 
fees these days. Those fees are included in miscellaneous deductions, which now 
are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross 
income. 
</P>
<P>
* Decide what kind of preparer is right for you. Storefront chains such as 
H&amp;R Block are good for simpler returns, and their fees tend to be lower. 
For more complex returns, consider enrolled agents, who must have worked in 
certain IRS tax occupations for at least five years or have passed a rigorous 
two-day IRS exam. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is a certified public accountant at a smaller accounting 
firm. Tax lawyers or CPAs at the big national accounting firms should be 
considered if you have a six-figure income and complicated tax situations. 
</P>
<P>
* Get referrals from friends, relatives or colleagues. Nothing beats a referral 
from a trusted friend and satisfied customer. Referrals for enrolled agents in 
your area are available by calling the National Assn. of Enrolled Agents at 
(800) 424-4339. 
</P>
<P>
* Interview at least three preparers before picking one. Find out about their 
experience in handling returns of people like you. Get names of their clients 
and call them. Ask how the preparer will be compensated; find out the fee in 
advance. Ask if they will accompany you to a meeting with the IRS if you are 
audited. And be wary of any preparer who doesn't ask you about your tax 
situation first before accepting you as a client. 
</P>
<P>
* Screen out fraudulent tax preparers. Just say "no" to preparers who promise 
you a refund without even looking at your tax situation, or those who base 
their fee on a percentage of your refund. Don't allow your refund check to go 
directly to the preparer. Never fill out a return in pencil, and never sign a 
blank return. "That's the equivalent of a blank check," tax expert Block says. 
</P>
<P>
* Get your records together. Many preparers charge by the hour, so it'll pay to 
get your receipts, financial statements and the like organized first. 
</P>
<P>
* Check -- and double check -- the preparer's work. If there are errors that 
result in you owing additional tax, interest or penalties, it's you -- not the 
preparer -- who's ultimately liable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally: Don't procrastinate much longer if you want to file your return by 
the April 16 deadline. Many good preparers get very busy toward mid-March and 
can't handle many more new clients after that.

A U.S. commission on aviation security and terrorism appointed after the Flight 
103 disaster said that airport security has improved in Europe. But, "if there 
is an Achilles' heel in aviation security, it is Africa, which is literally a 
basket case," said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), chairman of the House 
Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on aviation. 
</P>
<P>
Oberstar, at a London news conference, cited poor training for security 
personnel, high staff turnover, insufficient detection equipment and economic 
pressures on African governments for shortcomings there. President Bush 
appointed the seven-member commission after Pan AM Flight 103 from Frankfurt to 
New York via London was blown up by a terrorist bomb over the Scottish town of 
Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988.

Incidents of international terrorism declined about 25% in 1989, in part 
because of a decrease in Palestinian activity, but attacks by Iranian-sponsored 
Shiite groups rose, a U.S. official said. "Iran believes terrorism is a 
legitimate part of foreign policy," the unidentified official said. Preliminary 
figures compiled by the State Department for its annual report on terrorism to 
be issued next month also show a decline of about 27% in the number of 
fatalities from terrorist acts -- from 600 to 485.

A Texas couple will receive $3.3 million in the first out-of-court settlement 
reached in the deaths of 21 children in a school bus accident, a lawyer said in 
Houston. Kenneth Sparks, who represents Raul and Margarita Ortega of Alton, 
whose son died in the accident, said that a $1.5-million settlement agreed to 
by Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co. would provide an interest-bearing series of 
monthly payments guaranteed for 35 years. The bus and the company's truck 
collided at an intersection in Alton last September, sending the bus into a 
water-filled pit.

A Kentucky drug fugitive, whose 18-year flight was aided by a family member who 
declared him legally dead, was captured in Santa Cruz, the U.S. Marshals 
Service announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Two marshals, accompanied by local officers, raided the home of John Spelz on 
Thursday and arrested him after a struggle. Spelz evaded his Kentucky prison 
term in 1972 on a drug conviction. During Spelz's arrest, federal officers 
seized a suspected mobile drug lab parked in front of his home and recovered 
$250,000 in cash. Spelz's brother, his only living relative, had him declared 
legally dead in 1985, said Deputy U.S. Marshal David Hiebert. But federal 
officers traced Spelz to Santa Cruz, where he was living under the alias Robert 
Parker.

in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed on a 23-6 vote, but only after an amendment to condemn 
the violence that Mandela's movement has sparked failed 15-16. The condemnation 
call came from Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), and drew sharp criticism from 
more moderate senators, who labeled him a hypocrite and ill-intentioned. 
Doolittle blamed the African National Congress for a 1983 car bombing that 
killed 19 people and for periodic torture deaths of civilians.

ROONEY SUSPENSION SHEDS LIGHT ON STATUS OF BLACKS, GAYS IN TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Progress by minority groups in gaining equal treatment and justice need not be 
measured only by looking at ballot box results. Television, that almighty 
indicator of who's in and who's out, is another telling gauge. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Rooney, of "60 Minutes" fame, has recently come under fire for derogatory 
remarks made about gays as well as, and more conspicuously, for remarks made 
about blacks. Even though he has denied making the racist comments regarding 
blacks, he was suspended for three months without pay by CBS news. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, his earlier remarks aimed at gays, and not deniable since they were 
made over the air on a CBS special in December, met with no such response from 
network bigwigs. 
</P>
<P>
It is oddly fitting that two such varied responses by CBS to two Rooney slurs 
should occur just as some are questioning the appropriateness of the new cable 
offering "Secret Passions," a gay-oriented soap opera both produced and set in 
Orange County. At the very least, TV's inconsistent manner in dealing with the 
two minorities is revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Images on television do much to shape our views of groups we have little or no 
contact with. Opinions of gay men and lesbians, who are still underrepresented 
on the air, have often been forged out of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
While blacks have made heavy inroads in the effort to bring varying images to 
the tube, gays have had less success. The television industry has done next to 
nothing, for instance, to correct the omission of various worthy contributions 
made by gay men and lesbians to America's cultural history. 
</P>
<P>
How many TV productions on the lives of poet Walt Whitman or on the first 
native-born star of the U.S. stage, Charlotte Cushman, have you seen? What TV 
Western has ever shown that Native Americans held an enlightened and accepting 
view of homosexuality? 
</P>
<P>
Nor has television done much to show accurate and varied portrayals of gays in 
the present. The few attempts to go beyond stereotypes are invariably met with 
heavy resistance. 
</P>
<P>
A recent "thirtysomething" episode that featured a frank portrayal of two men 
in a dating situation was met with strong protest by groups on the religious 
right. A few days later, several sponsors bowed to the pressure and withdrew 
support from the show. 
</P>
<P>
In the real world, the list of gay-oriented groups in Orange County alone 
indicates concerns and interests very similar to those of the general 
population. Too lengthy to incorporate here, the list includes a gay bowling 
league, a group for gay alcoholics, a gay parents group, gay Mormons, and even 
a group of gay owners and admirers of classic autos. 
</P>
<P>
Given the incredible variety existing within the gay and lesbian community, it 
would take several shows offering gays as characters to even begin to portray 
the real diversity of gays. But not surprisingly, opposition to the fledgling 
gay soap, "Secret Passions," which is unique in its genre, has already begun to 
take shape. 
</P>
<P>
Those who fight the airing of these types of shows, aside from showing 
disrespect for the First Amendment, are fighting portrayals of the real America 
and are choosing ignorance over fact. 
</P>
<P>
With groups such as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, gays are 
just beginning to find ways to effectively fight for honest and varied 
portrayals on the small screen. But as the Rooney suspension indicates, black 
power, on the tube at least, has already arrived.

PIANIST ROMERO TO BE FEATURED AT MOZART FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist Gustavo Romero will be a featured soloist in this year's Mainly Mozart 
Festival at the Old Globe Theatre, May 31-June 9, the festival's music 
director, David Atherton, announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The former music director of the San Diego Symphony (1980-87), who now holds a 
similar post with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, re-entered the local musical 
scene last year with a 10-day chamber orchestra festival at the Old Globe's 
outdoor Lowell Davies Festival Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The British maestro said this year's programming will follow last year's 
inaugural model, with four outdoor orchestral programs under his baton. Each 
orchestra concert will be repeated the following evening. In addition, the 
single chamber music program, with Romero, a San Diego native, playing Mozart's 
Piano and Wind Quintet, will be moved to one of the Globe's indoor theaters. 
</P>
<P>
The opening concert will feature festival concertmaster William Preucil, first 
violinist of the Cleveland String Quartet, in Mozart's Third Violin Concerto. 
The June 3 program will present Romero in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9 as well 
as violist Cynthia Phelps in the rarely performed "Fantasia on a Theme by 
Mozart" by Johann Nepomuk Hummel, a pupil of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
Cellist Ronald Thomas will perform Tchaikovsky's "Variations on a Rococo Theme" 
and Rachmaninoff's "Vocalise" on June 6. On the festival's closing concert, 
Pittsburgh Symphony principal bassoonist Nancy Goeres will solo in Mozart's 
Bassoon Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
According to festival manager Nancy Laturno, the $420,000 project has received 
$15,000 in advance ticket sales and significant underwriting, including housing 
and rehearsal space from downtown San Diego's Kingston Hotel. She also said the 
festival finished its first year in the black, averaging 80% nightly 
attendance.

ASK THE JUDGE: WHEN AIDS ENTERS IN TO HOUSE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By B. TAM NOMOTO, B. Tam Nomoto, is an Orange County Municipal Court judge. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. I would like to sell my house that I have been renting out for the last few 
years. My tenant, a very nice young man, died a few months ago from AIDS. I am 
wondering if I have any duty to tell a buyer about this. Does the law say I 
have to? 
</P>
<P>
GG, Orange 
</P>
<P>
A. The law requires an owner of real property to disclose to the buyer if an 
occupant has died on the property in the three years before the date of the 
offer to purchase, except if the occupant died of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
If the buyer, however, asks you any questions concerning any deaths on the 
property, the law does prohibit you from intentionally misrepresenting the 
facts to him. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am a single parent with a teen-age son. My son is normally a good kid with 
average grades. He, like most boys his age, does occasionally get into trouble, 
which is why I am writing to you. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, my son was caught with a friend writing school slogans on a 
neighbor's fence. The neighbor was furious and said I couldn't control my 
child. My feeling is that my son should be the one he's yelling at. What's the 
law on this? 
</P>
<P>
TP, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. The law specifically provides that a parent is responsible for any graffiti 
that her minor child willfully writes on another person's property. A parent 
can be sued for an amount not more than $10,000 for each act of misconduct by 
the minor, as well as court costs and attorney fees if the parent loses in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Last year I won a small claims case, and the defendant owes me a little 
under $1,000. What is the best way to try to collect? 
</P>
<P>
BT, Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
A. This is a commonly asked question and one that seems to trouble most small 
claims plaintiffs that win their lawsuit. As a result, the Legislature has just 
passed a law that would allow a small claims debtor to pay the amount of the 
judgment to the court that heard the case. The court will notify the judgment 
service. Contact the court that heard your case for more details on how to use 
this new procedure. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to do this, you may follow any of the more traditional 
approaches. One of the most commonly used methods would be to garnish the wages 
of your judgment debtor so that his employer withholds a portion of his 
paycheck to satisfy your judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Another method is to execute on any real or personal property that the judgment

WHO SHOULD BEAR BURDEN WHEN L.A. EXPORTS SMOG?

When residents of San Diego County found themselves under siege from heavy smog 
55 days last year, they had more than themselves to blame. 
</P>
<P>
A report released this week by the San Diego County Air Pollution Control 
District blamed smog blown down from Los Angeles for three out of every four 
days that San Diego exceeded the federal clean air standard for ozone, a 
health-threatening air pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not smog that kind of comes in and mixes with San Diego smog and the 
two add and go over the health standard," said R.J. Sommerville, San Diego 
County's air pollution control officer. "This is a . . . smog cloud that rolls 
into San Diego (from Los Angeles). It's characteristically quite intense. You 
can watch the monitoring stations in Del Mar and along the coast. They'll just 
go up in a very short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Trans-boundary pollution -- the tainted air that travels from one region to 
another -- is not a new phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
But the worsening impact of the traveling pollution underscores the dilemma 
many air pollution authorities are facing in trying to clean up their skies. 
Local and regional plans to return blue skies to smoggy areas may not be enough 
to fight someone else's pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The problem goes far beyond San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino, Riverside and Palm Springs all have been victims of pollution 
generated along the Los Angeles County coast. 
</P>
<P>
To the north, the Air Force has long complained that space shuttle landings and 
flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base may be jeopardized by reduced 
visibility brought on by Los Angeles smog. 
</P>
<P>
In western Colorado, 15% of reduced visibility was attributed by one study to 
pollution from California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles smog has even been measured by scientists at Death Valley and the 
Grand Canyon, two of America's premier natural wonders. 
</P>
<P>
Using sensitive instruments, scientists proved that air pollution in Los 
Angeles and the Grand Canyon were linked by releasing trace gases in Los 
Angeles that subsequently were detected in the national park. In the case of 
areas such as San Diego, scientists know the origin of the pollution because of 
well-documented wind current patterns. 
</P>
<P>
As the trans-boundary pollution problem spreads, individual air pollution 
control districts -- which are mandating increasingly stringent and costly 
emission controls in their areas -- are finding that even their most energetic 
efforts are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
The issues are complex and not easily solved. Congress is finding that 
trans-boundary pollution is among the stickier problems it confronts in 
attempting to come up with amendments to the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Who is to blame for air pollution in a given area? Who is to pay for the 
cleanup? Should residents and businesses in an area burdened by imported smog 
be required to pay for even tougher controls to hold the line? Should 
smog-producing regions such as the Los Angeles Basin be required to take 
tougher steps to reduce how much of their smog goes elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, are quick to acknowledge that the 
region's smog does not honor boundary lines drawn on a map. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we would concur that there are meteorological conditions where we 
contribute unhealthy air to San Diego County," concedes James M. Lents, 
executive officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego also gets some smog from Mexico. And smog originating in San 
Diego winds up in Imperial County. There are even times -- few to be sure -- 
when San Diego's smog blows north into the Los Angeles Basin, the state Air 
Resources Board said. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the direction smog takes between Los Angeles and 
San Diego is one way -- headed south. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Santa Ana winds carry the smog to sea where it stagnates for a day 
or two. More often than not, it blows right back into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But there are times when the pollutants blow out to sea and are picked up by 
prevailing onshore winds that carry them into San Diego County, coming ashore 
at Del Mar, San Diego and Chula Vista, according to Chung Liu, planning manager 
with the AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
"When the San Diego area generates enough pollution to come very close to the 
health standards, then emissions from the South Coast Air Basin are enough to 
push it over the top," said state Air Resources Board spokesman Bill Sessa. 
</P>
<P>
But Sommerville, the San Diego air pollution control officer, insists that most 
of the time Los Angeles smog is solely to blame for incidents of excessive smog 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The federal health standard is exceeded when ozone concentrations exceed the 
federal standard of 0.12 parts of ozone per million parts of air for one hour. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a major health threat that can cause respiratory illness, reduce lung 
capacity in even healthy adults during exercise, and weaken the body's immune 
system. It also can damage crops, trees and building materials. Ozone is formed 
when hydrocarbons, such as gasoline fumes, react with oxides of nitrogen, such 
as tailpipe emissions, in the presence of sunlight. Ozone makes up about 95% of 
what is commonly called smog. 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that growth and development in San Diego County is a 
major contributor to the city's worsening air pollution. Gains made against air 
pollution during the past five years in San Diego are being offset by 
population increases, which bring more cars and increased development. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 10 years ago, all of the high ozone days in San Diego were 
laid at the door of Los Angeles. A more recent study examining 158 days in 1985 
and 1986 when maximum ozone concentrations equaled or exceeded the federal 
standard showed that was no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
"About half the time (49%), ozone or precursor emissions were transported from 
the South Coast Air Basin, and a little over a quarter of the time (28%) no 
transport was found to impact San Diego," a study by the state Air Resources 
Board found. It could not be determined where the remaining 23% originated. 
</P>
<P>
The same study indicated that Mexico also may contribute to San Diego's 
pollution problem. During 31 of the 158 days when ozone levels exceeded the 
federal standard in San Diego, researchers said pollution from Tijuana may have 
been a contributing factor. 
</P>
<P>
All of this raises questions about how effective regional air pollution control 
plans are and whether they should be merged to fight the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Lents, of the AQMD, and Sommerville, of the San Diego district, think not. 
Sommerville agreed with AQMD officials, saying San Diego will benefit as the 
Los Angeles Basin implements its tough new air pollution control plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really no good purpose served by having one huge agency," Sommerville 
said, adding that the tough regulations needed in Los Angeles are not necessary 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But the California Clean Air Act nonetheless requires one region to take 
another region into consideration when implementing smog-reducing regulations. 
The regional districts are asked to be good neighbors and impose extra 
controls, if necessary, to keep their pollution out of someone else's back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Tom Eichhorn, an AQMD spokesman, said the district's new 20-year plan 
to reduce air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin by 80% to 90% "will 
significantly reduce our contribution to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego and other spots where smog imports are of concern, residents and 
businesses have argued against stricter local air pollution controls on the 
grounds that the biggest share of pollution comes from outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Air Pollution Control District, for instance, is urging 
Congress to amend the federal Clean Air Act to take San Diego's situation into 
account. If the federal government does not give San Diego credit for the fact 
that some of its air pollution originates in Los Angeles, San Diego will be 
forced to impose far more stringent local controls. "If we have to do more 
because of things we can't control, it doesn't seem quite fair," said Bob 
Goggin, spokesman for the San Diego district. 
</P>
<P>
The argument is familiar to federal authorities, who hear the same from states 
affected by trans-boundary pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of doubt how one might try to force a state to do something," 
Brock Nicholson, chief of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ozone and 
carbon monoxide policy development, said in a telephone interview from North 
Carolina. "There's always a tendency of a downwind state to say don't make me 
do as much. Upwind states say, wait a minute, it's not all me." 
</P>
<P>
California is not alone in having an impact outside its boundaries. In the 
Northeast, air pollutants from Virginia to Rhode Island are finding their way 
to New Hampshire and Maine, including President Bush's retreat at 
Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment proposed for the federal Clean Air Act calls for creating an 
"interstate (air pollution) transport commission" to study the scientific and 
technical aspects of the problem and then make recommendations to affected 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the result of the clean air negotiations, California authorities say 
that trans-boundary pollution should not become an excuse to ease up on local 
controls. 
</P>
<P>
"What our studies show is that all air basins inherit some pollution from some 
other region and also contribute pollution to other regions. But, by and large, 
the pollution in any given region is locally generated," said Sessa.

L.A. HOPES TO LURE TEACHERS WITH HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH and SANDY BANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to recruit teachers for public schools, the city of Los Angeles 
is developing a plan to build as many as 5,000 housing units at the Chatsworth 
Reservoir, an abandoned facility that has become a wildlife refuge, City Hall 
sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is in a "very preliminary" stage, according to Deputy Mayor Mark 
Fabiani, who said the high cost of housing in Southern California makes it 
difficult to recruit and keep teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to provide affordable housing for teachers who are willing to 
dedicate part of their teaching career to working in public schools that have 
been especially hard hit by gangs and drugs," Fabiani said. "It's becoming 
increasingly difficult to attract teachers to these schools." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which had not previously been made public, is expected to encounter 
strong opposition from community groups. Councilman Hal Bernson, in whose 
district the reservoir is located, will oppose any plan to develop the area, an 
aide said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One City Hall source involved in the project said that plans now under 
discussion call for construction of 5,000 housing units, 500 of which would be 
set aside for UCLA faculty members. Single-family homes or townhouses in the 
development would be rented for about $1,200 a month, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The development may be carried out as a joint project, with the UCLA School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning participating in its design, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Friday that the plans are so preliminary that the probable size of 
the development, including the number of housing units, is not yet known. 
However, he confirmed that UCLA has been approached about participating in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for even schools such as UCLA and other 
public universities to attract qualified teachers to Southern California 
because of the price of housing," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our notion was that perhaps using some city land in a cooperative effort with 
some public universities such as UCLA and others, we could construct housing 
that would be affordable to public school teachers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said that it is unclear how the project would be developed and financed 
but that the options include a joint city-UCLA venture or an arrangement with a 
developer who might lease the land from the city under stringent conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani also said that if opposition to the site is too strong, a similar plan 
might be carried out at some other location in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The land, about 1,200 acres in the western San Fernando Valley, belongs to the 
city's Department of Water and Power, and the Recreation and Parks Department 
has the first right to purchase it if DWP decides to sell it. The reservoir has 
been empty since it was damaged in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, development plans -- including a recent proposal to construct a 
golf course -- have met with strong local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Greig Smith, chief deputy to Councilman Bernson, said Friday that neither he 
nor Bernson had been informed about the plan to build housing on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We would definitely be opposed to it," Smith said. "It's a very ecologically 
sensitive area. . . . There's a lot of wildlife there and we want to keep it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
The land has become part of a flyway for migrating Canada geese, Smith said, as 
well as a habitat for fish. It also is home to deer. 
</P>
<P>
"Every other year or so they (DWP officials) come and say, 'Gee, can't we sell 
it?' and we say no," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Friday that the proposal originated in the mayor's office. He 
expressed concern about it being publicly disclosed before Bernson and others 
were notified about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we decide anything about the size of the development and about the way 
the development will be integrated with the surrounding community, we will 
obviously have to spend a great deal of time with Councilman Bernson and with 
homeowners groups," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't want folks to feel that we are running around promoting 
ideas that affect their districts and affect the school system without talking 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said a meeting with school district officials is scheduled for next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Yamahara, the Los Angeles Unified School District's associate 
superintendent for personnel, said housing costs pose a problem for only a 
small percentage -- between 5% and 10% -- of teachers they recruit each year. 
About 70% of their new teachers are from Southern California, and most of the 
rest are from other areas in the state, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The district has about 27,000 teachers who work in city and some county 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
A beginning teacher makes about $27,400 a year, so at $1,200 a month, the homes 
would be relatively expensive for new teacher recruits. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine M. Carey, a spokeswoman for United Teachers-Los Angeles, said Friday 
that she was unaware of the proposal and questioned its practicality. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly, people want to work near where they live, so they don't want to have 
to hit the freeways in the morning for an hour-and-a-half drive," Carey said. 
"In asking for specific assignments, teachers basically want to teach near 
where they live." 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said, "People commute even farther than that in the search for 
affordable housing these days. People who are working in Los Angeles are living 
in San Bernardino and Riverside." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the proposal, a transportation system including shuttle buses and 
car and van pools would be developed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani emphasized that many of the details of the plan, including who would 
develop it and whether the houses would be sold or rented, have not been worked 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Morabito, UCLA's assistant vice chancellor for business enterprises, said 
the university had one "very preliminary" discussion with the city about the 
housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The thinking is that (the reservoir) could be perhaps redeveloped or developed 
into affordable housing for a variety of people, primarily education-related 
types," he said. "The thinking has not gone beyond the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We are at least interested in hearing more about what the city has in mind," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Morabito, the cost of housing in Los Angeles, particularly on the 
Westside, makes it difficult to attract talented faculty prospects from other 
parts of the nation. "So we are always looking for potential sites. . . . If 
the city is going to do something out there, we may have some interest." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Chatsworth area may be too far away for commuting to the 
Westwood campus and that most faculty members want to live near the school. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, UCLA has created two housing projects for faculty: a 
group of 58 townhouses in Beverly Glen, which sold for $155,000 to $255,000 in 
1986; and a 32-unit building in Westwood, where condominiums sold last year for 
$140,000 to $300,000. The units all sold for below market prices and have tough 
resale restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is also planning 86 single-family homes in the Westchester Bluffs area 
near Playa Vista. But that is still in the permit process. Those large houses 
may sell for more than $500,000 -- and that would be a bargain for the 
Westside, Morabito said.

BONE MARROW OF FETUS FITS AILING SISTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK and IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Walnut couple having a baby in hopes of providing a bone marrow donor for 
their ill teen-age daughter disclosed Friday that the fetus' marrow cells 
appear to be nearly identical to the girl's and may be able to save her life. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte announced the 
match and said a bone marrow transplant from a compatible donor has a 70% 
chance of thwarting the type of leukemia afflicting 17-year-old Anissa Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
But medical experts cautioned that the unusual case may give false hope to 
desperate parents of young leukemia patients. 
</P>
<P>
This is because there is only a one-in-four chance that siblings with the same 
mother and father will have closely compatible bone marrow cells, and 
conceiving a baby solely for the purpose of donating bone marrow to a sibling 
raises troubling ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our baby, this is our miracle baby," said a jubilant Abe Ayala, 
Anissa's 45-year-old father, speaking to reporters at the Covina-based 
Life-Savers Foundation of America, which recruits donors for the 9,000 
Americans who are awaiting bone marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all very, very blessed," sobbed Mary Ayala, 43, who is due to give 
birth to a girl in mid-April. "I feel my baby is a blessing from God." 
</P>
<P>
Their daughter, Anissa, was diagnosed in 1988 with chronic myelogenous 
leukemia, a form of leukemia that can be cured only with a bone marrow 
transplant, according to City of Hope physicians who are caring for the Walnut 
High School student. 
</P>
<P>
But a search by the National Marrow Donor Program for unrelated donors and 
testing of Anissa's family members failed to locate a suitable donor. 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Anissa cried when asked about her parents' decision to 
have the new baby. "A lot of people think, 'How can you do this? How can you be 
having this baby for your daughter?' " she said. "But she's my baby sister and 
we're going to love her for who she is, not for what she can give me." 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, when Mary Ayala was about three months pregnant, she underwent 
amniocentesis. In this procedure, an obstetrician inserts a needle into the 
uterus through the abdominal wall. A sample of the fluid from around the fetus, 
which contains fetal cells, is obtained for laboratory analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Amniocentesis is normally recommended for all pregnant women over the age of 35 
because of the increased risk of birth defects in babies of older mothers. As 
part of the test, the sex of the fetus is learned. 
</P>
<P>
In the Ayala case, the physicians also determined the tissue type of the fetus. 
The results of the tissue typing indicated that the siblings' bone marrow cells 
will almost certainly be compatible, doctors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew about (the positive results) within the past month, but the family 
didn't want it out because of all the questions coming up, the ethical 
questions," said Dr. Patricia Konrad, a pediatric oncologist at City of Hope 
who is caring for Anissa. 
</P>
<P>
Konrad and other medical experts not connected with the case have expressed 
concern about the vexing issue of conceiving a baby solely for the purpose of 
trying to save another sibling's life. Konrad warned that the Ayalas' 
experience may not be an example for other parents to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never advise a family to have a baby for that purpose," she said. 
"Besides, there are very few families with identical situations." 
</P>
<P>
A Seattle tumor specialist recalled other isolated attempts, both successful 
and unsuccessful, where a child was conceived with the hope that it would be a 
bone marrow donor. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Patrick Beatty, a medical oncologist and head of the tissue typing 
laboratory at the University of Washington's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center, said Friday that he knew of several cases where a baby conceived as a 
possible donor turned out to have compatible bone marrow. In these cases, 
however, laboratory tests to determine the compatibility of the bone marrow 
were not performed until after the child was born. 
</P>
<P>
"This (case) disturbs me a lot," Beatty said. 
</P>
<P>
About one in 200 times, amniocentesis results in a miscarriage. If Mary Ayala 
had been under age 35, the procedure probably would not have been recommended 
as a screen for birth defects. 
</P>
<P>
"This brings up other issues," Beatty added. "When you get the results back, if 
it's not a match, would a couple then think about abortion?" 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University 
of Minnesota in Minneapolis, said he was concerned about the impact on the 
donor child if the procedure fails. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a terrible burden to place on the person," he said. "It means they 
failed the purpose for which their parents conceived them." 
</P>
<P>
When the baby is at least 6 months old, Konrad and Dr. Stephen Forman, director 
of hematology and bone marrow transplantation at the hospital, plan to destroy 
Anissa's diseased bone marrow with chemotherapy and radiation. Then they plan 
to obtain marrow from the baby's hipbone and inject it into Anissa through a 
vein, similar to a blood transfusion. The marrow cells can travel through the 
bloodstream to the bone marrow, where they grow. 
</P>
<P>
If the leukemia disappears and does not relapse within two years after the 
procedure, Anissa will be considered completely cured, Forman said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said the search for an unrelated donor for Anissa will continue because 
there is a chance that she will need medical help before her sister is 6 months 
old.

Tornadoes and high winds wrecked houses in the Southeast on Friday as 
thunderstorms roamed from Florida north to Pennsylvania, swamping towns, 
sending creeks surging beyond their banks and driving hundreds of people from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
At least one death was reported, and one person was missing as rescue workers 
broke out rubber rafts, boats and even a helicopter to extricate threatened 
Southern residents from danger. 
</P>

Seven snow-related highway deaths were reported as up to 18 inches of new snow 
fell on parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
A cold front colliding with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico stirred up the 
stormy weather across the Southeast, sending twisters rampaging into Cooper, 
Daleville and Ft. Rucker, Ala., Irmo, S.C., and Carrollton, Ga., the National 
Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
"One house was actually blown off the foundation and moved to the center of the 
street," a rescue worker said in Carrollton, where 15 homes were destroyed or 
severely damaged. Ten people were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service posted three separate tornado watches late Friday from 
Georgia to New York and warned that more severe thunderstorms were possible 
elsewhere along the East Coast. Gusts to 63 m.p.h. accompanied a thunderstorm 
roving over Robins Air Force Base in Georgia.

More than 10 inches of rain pelted Summerville, Ga., forcing dozens of 
evacuations. Flooding was also reported in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, 
North Carolina and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Swirling waters spilling from the Ocoee River rose to the second story of 
buildings in Copperhill, Tenn., where rescue workers used rubber rafts to 
remove 15 stranded people. As many as 150 people fled from floodwaters that 
authorities said reached 18 feet in spots. 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee Valley Authority sent a helicopter to rescue six employees 
trapped at a station on the banks of the Ocoee that was swamped with four feet 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain overwhelmed a dam on the Chattooga River at Trion in northwest 
Georgia, forcing the evacuation of schools, homes and businesses. As many as 
1,000 people had to be moved. 
</P>
<P>
A man walking along the banks of a river about two miles north of the flooded 
dam was missing after being swept into the current. 
</P>
<P>
High winds and rains struck central Alabama before dawn, injuring at least six 
people and forcing more than 250 from their homes. Secondary roads and bridges 
were under water and schools were closed in at least 13 counties.

<P>
A stretch of U.S. Highway 64 and a segment of Interstate 40 were shut down, and 
rockslides and floodwaters closed seven bridges in Clay County, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
A winter storm hit portions of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Up to 12 
inches of snow was forecast in Michigan, more than 3,000 people lost power in 
the Detroit area, and many schools were closed statewide. At least two Michigan 
traffic deaths were blamed on the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Iron Range -- with at least 10 inches of new snow and more coming 
down -- reported at least five weather-related traffic deaths Thursday and 
Friday. Up to 18 inches of snow blitzed northern Wisconsin, freezing rain hit 
the south and some areas got both.

ARAB INFORMANT HACKED TO DEATH

Hundreds of people gathered at a village square in the West Bank to watch 
Palestinian militants hack to death an Arab man who admitted being an informer 
for Israel, Arab reporters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the victim, Mohammed Khatatbeh, was left in the central square in 
the village of Beit Furik, and his family was not allowed to bury him in the 
town, the reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
Well over 150 Palestinians have been killed by their brethren since the 
uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in 
December, 1987. Like Khatatbeh, most were accused of cooperating with Israeli 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Arab reporters, Khatatbeh was kidnaped Tuesday from his Beit 
Furik home by six Palestinians. The following day, they took him to the village 
mosque where he confessed over a loudspeaker that he had informed on fellow 
Palestinians since 1968 and once led three Palestine Liberation Organization 
guerrillas into an army ambush. Israeli officials say Palestinian activists 
often use torture and violent interrogations to force such confessions from 
suspected collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
The militants then asked what should be done with Khatatbeh, and hundreds of 
villagers poured into the streets and chanted, "Kill him! Kill him!" 
</P>
<P>
Khatatbeh was hacked to death with axes and knives late Thursday as about 250 
villagers looked on, the reporters said. 
</P>
<P>
The army command confirmed that a body was found in Beit Furik and said the 
case is being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the alleged collaborators, about 625 Palestinians have been 
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the uprising, and 43 Israelis have 
died.

Hard-line Israeli politician Ariel Sharon -- who organized the 1982 invasion of 
Lebanon and admitted his mistake in allowing Christians to slaughter 
Palestinians in refugee camps -- has called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 
"dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth published Friday, the 
61-year-old architect of Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion admitted that his 
misjudgment led to the slaughter of Palestinians by Christians in Lebanon's 
Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps. Israeli troops had surrounded the camps at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Yitzhak Shamir is a dangerous man. I will never forgive Yitzhak Shamir for 
putting this nation to sleep," Sharon said in the interview published four days 
after he announced his resignation as trade minister. 
</P>
<P>
"Yitzhak Shamir is definitely a cruel man," said Sharon, who has vowed to 
launch a campaign against a government proposal for Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations after he formally resigns at a weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh adjectives to describe Shamir, 74, contrasted with Sharon's earlier 
pledge to focus on issues rather than personalities. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming victory over Shamir at a chaotic meeting last Monday of their rightist 
Likud Party, Sharon told the newspaper: "I still believe I will be prime 
minister of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon admitted his misjudgment in the Lebanon war while defending his 
criticism of what he called Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's failure to quash a 
26-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
An Israeli judicial inquiry in 1983 found Sharon, then defense minister, 
indirectly responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of Palestinian men, women 
and children by Christian militiamen at the two Beirut area refugee camps 
surrounded by Israeli troops. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry forced him to resign the Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"So I paid the heaviest price for not figuring the Christians would slaughter 
the Muslims. That was my indirect responsibility. But Rabin must pay for his 
direct responsibility for this big failure," Sharon told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
To support his accusation that Shamir is cruel, Sharon cited the case of 
Jonathan Pollard, an American jailed for life by the United States for stealing 
U.S. secrets for Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Jonathan Pollard might have been saved from life imprisonment in the United 
States," Sharon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Pollard performed a great service to Israel, and I thought something must be 
done to rescue him. But in a meeting of a group of ministers, Shamir said, 
without batting an eyelid, 'You need to know how to sacrifice the man for the 
greater goal.' "

AFTER 5 TRIES, BEIRUTI ESCAPES DEVASTATED NEIGHBORHOOD;

Five times this month, he had tried to escape from Ein Rummaneh, the East 
Beirut neighborhood that has been shelled day and night for most of February. 
On the fifth attempt, he finally made it. 
</P>
<P>
The man, in his late 20s and identified only as Elie, showed the strain of the 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
He was sallow and short-tempered -- "hardly recognizable," friends said -- and 
his account of the ordeal was repetitious and jumbled. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had huddled for days in a dark but relatively safe room, together 
with 35 neighbors, as rival Christian forces fought for control of Ein 
Rummaneh, an area of about six square miles that once was home to 100,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Today, witnesses say, Ein Rummaneh looks like a cemetery that has been hit by 
an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Since the end of January, the forces of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun had been trying 
to make the Lebanese Forces militia, commanded by Samir Geagea, put down their 
arms. And after more than two weeks of bitter fighting, described as the 
fiercest and bloodiest of the civil war that began 15 years ago, the issue was 
decided late Friday when Aoun routed Geagea's forces. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only one way for Aoun to enter Ein Rummaneh," Geagea had been quoted 
as saying earlier Friday, "and that is by killing all the people there." 
</P>
<P>
Elie told a reporter that on Feb. 1 he went to work as usual, but left at noon 
after learning that the rival forces were fighting in Ein Rummaneh. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove home through artillery and mortar fire," he said, adding that it was 
nothing compared to what was to come. 
</P>
<P>
Literally thousands of shells and rockets have crashed into the area as gunners 
have sought to dislodge fighters who have taken over one building after 
another. Hospitals have been hit, along with the offices of the Red Cross. 
Firemen have been unable to get to buildings set ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
Bodies lie where they fell. More than 500 people have been killed and 2,000 or 
more wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We ate cheese and yogurt," Elie said. "We cooked simple meals on a camp 
stove." 
</P>
<P>
He wondered aloud about the fate of his parents and two brothers, who stayed 
behind because trying to get out was too risky. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I tried to escape," he said, "the LF (Lebanese Forces) stopped 
me. They said no young men would be allowed to leave the area. When I told them 
I wanted to get food for my family, they said, 'Send the women.' " 
</P>
<P>
On his second try, he said, the Lebanese Forces allowed him to pass, but he was 
turned back at an army checkpoint. On the next two tries, he was forced back by 
heavy shelling. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Wednesday, he set out for a fifth time, taking nothing with him but 
money. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Lebanese Forces allowed him to pass, but only after a thorough body 
search to make sure he was not an army man trying to infiltrate the 
neighborhood in civilian clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"They pulled up his pants legs and checked for red marks on his legs that come 
from wearing tight army boots," said a friend who had already heard Elie's 
story. "Then they checked for red marks on his shoulders, where the rifle is 
carried. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they sniffed his breath. Do you know why? Because the smell of gunpowder 
clings to the face and mouth -- a sure sign of a soldier or fighter." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Elie was passed through, and he proceeded quickly to the so-called 
Green Line that separates Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is with friends, safe but nearing a mental breakdown. He stares fixedly 
toward the east. 
</P>
<P>
Friends try to assure him that his family is probably safe, too, and he 
responds, "Inshallah, inshallah" -- "If God wills, if God wills."

WINDS OF CHANGE RUFFLING JAPAN'S 'WINDLESS' ELECTION DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS, INCUMBENTS ARE BEING CHALLENGED. IT IS A 
SYMBOL OF THE RULING PARTY'S TASK IN SUNDAY'S VOTING.

<P>
It may not be a revolution brewing, but a few mild gusts are blowing in Japan's 
"windless election district." 
</P>
<P>
This drab city, about an hour's bullet-train ride northwest of Tokyo, is the 
center of the strange political phenomenon of Gunma-sanku -- the No. 3 district 
of Gunma prefecture (state). 
</P>
<P>
Here, the same four men -- three conservative Liberal Democrats and one 
Socialist Party stalwart -- have kept a grip on this district's four seats in 
the lower house of Parliament since 1963. The lack of change is what inspires 
pundits, and even locals, to adopt the "windless" label. But if Gunma once 
symbolized the stasis of Japanese politics, now it offers a showcase on the 
histrionics of potential political change. 
</P>
<P>
As the Sunday election approaches, hand-wringing over whether the ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party can keep its 35-year monopoly on legislative power is 
very much in vogue. And this is where the pundits like to point. For the first 
time in recent memory, the Gunma-sanku incumbents are actually being challenged 
for their seats. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister tainted by fund-raising 
scandals, is said to be seriously worried that his distinguished career as a 
statesman may end in humiliating electoral defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Another, the Socialist Party's secretary general, Tsuruo Yamaguchi, has 
reluctantly endorsed a rival opposition candidate in a strategy to knock 
Nakasone out of Parliament. But aides say Yamaguchi fears the plan may 
backfire: Splitting rural Gunma's limited progressive vote could deprive the 
Socialist leader of his own seat. 
</P>
<P>
The spoiler is Kenichi Shiraishi, 46, a veteran telecommunications union 
official, who is running under the banner of the labor federation Rengo with 
the backing of four moderate opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
"My slogan is, 'Make a clear distinction between black and white,' " Shiraishi 
said in an interview the other day. "I'm the one in the white hat. I don't need 
to say who's wearing black." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Nakasone, too, was wearing the obligatory white gloves of the ethically 
pristine politician when he opened his campaign with rare public appearances 
one recent Saturday. He also was wearing the traditional white candidate's sash 
while describing the Gunma contest as a microcosm of the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
"All the nation, all the world, is watching Gunma-sanku," Nakasone intoned from 
a stage before throngs of supporters in the Takasaki Wholesale Center 
auditorium. "Will the conservatives win or lose? Japan's destiny is tied to 
this district." 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone, 71, one of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's factional bosses who 
served as prime minister from 1982-87, nominally resigned from the party last 
year to atone for his murky role in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal. 
Prosecutors said they found no evidence that he broke any law, but he still 
carries the stain of scandal as he fights for his seat as a so-called 
"independent" candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Matters were made worse when the influential Asahi newspaper published a report 
on New Year's Day alleging that a former Nakasone aide earned about $840,000 in 
ethically questionable stock transactions. Nakasone answered the charges by 
suing the Asahi for libel. 
</P>
<P>
The progressives are not alone in condemning the former premier. Last Sunday, 
an enraged right-wing extremist burst into Nakasone's campaign headquarters and 
fired three shots from a handgun, hitting a television set, a campaign poster 
and a good-luck daruma doll. Nakasone was out campaigning, and no one was 
injured in the bizarre incident. 
</P>
<P>
But the old-guard politician also is under attack from more moderate 
conservatives. Detecting a growing intolerance for Nakasone's sullied image at 
the grass-roots level, a former Nakasone protege in the Gunma Prefectural 
Assembly, Kunio Sato, 46, also declared as an unaffiliated candidate for the 
lower house and campaigns on an anti-Nakasone platform. 
</P>
<P>
The turncoat Sato is likely to have far more impact on campaign rhetoric than 
on the ballot box, though. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of Nakasone's notoriety, Gunma appears to be one of the few 
constituencies in Japan where political ethics is being raised as a major 
election issue, despite the widespread fallout of the Recruit scandal. After 
representing the district for 16 terms, however, Nakasone may well possess a 
resilient base of support. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a fine politician," said Hideo Aoki, 62, a local businessman. 
"All this talk about corruption is nothing more than allegations. I don't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Gunma-sanku's top vote getter, by all accounts, will be a Liberal Democrat 
exercising one of the time-honored traditions of Japanese politics -- 
inheriting his father's Parliament seat. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 30 years or more, the big question around election time here has 
been which of two rival Liberal Democratic Party factional bosses will draw 
more votes, Nakasone or Takeo Fukuda, another former prime minister who usually 
came out on top in the "Fuku-Naka war." Fukuda, 85, is retiring this year and 
handing his political mantle to his eldest son, Yasuo, 53, who served as his 
father's personal secretary for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The transfer is hardly unusual. More than 40% of the ruling party's members of 
Parliament belong to a kind of political aristocracy, having inherited 
political machines from their fathers. In some cases, the job is passed down 
through several generations, or handed over to widows or adopted sons. 
Opposition lawmakers engage in the same practice, though not as frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Following Yasuo Fukuda in the local straw polls is Keizo Obuchi, 52, an 
uncontroversial former chief Cabinet secretary belonging to yet another faction 
of the ruling party. Only Fukuda and Obuchi are assured of winning, the 
pundits, candidates and voters seem to agree. Nakasone, Yamaguchi and Shiraishi 
will fight for the remaining two seats. Shiraishi is the dark horse. Sato and a 
seventh, Communist candidate are dismissed out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
If Gunma-sanku and its 542,230 voters are a bellwether for the entire election, 
then all the fuss over the "winds of change" could very well fade away Monday, 
when the ballots are counted, with very little difference on the political map. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tough election," said a Nakasone aide. "But then, elections 
are always tough."

MONGOLIA COMMUNISTS MAY GIVE UP MONOPOLY ON POWER

<TEXT>
<P>
A senior Mongolian official strongly hinted Friday that the ruling Communist 
Party may relinquish its 66-year monopoly on power as a democratic group 
prepares to form the nation's first opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
Byraagiin Chimed also told journalists that Mongolia's public prosecutor would 
launch an investigation into alleged abuses of power by former President 
Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal -- a close associate of his successor, Jambyn Batmonh. 
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Democratic Assn. (MDA) is due to hold its first congress Sunday, 
at which it is widely expected to proclaim the nation's first opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
The MDA has held five mass rallies in the capital since last December, drawing 
thousands of people wrapped in fur and padded gowns against the extreme cold. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, democracy in state bodies was not enough," Chimed, head of the 
Presidium of the People's Great Hural (parliament) told a news conference of 
foreign and local journalists. 
</P>
<P>
He said the constitution of Mongolia's Communist Party is being rewritten and a 
final draft will be ready for ratification in June. 
</P>
<P>
The constitution has no mechanism for recognizing political opposition groups; 
it says only the Communist Party may rule. 
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, located between China and the Soviet Union, is the second oldest 
Communist state. Many of Mongolia's 2 million people are nomadic herdsmen and 
half the population of Ulan Bator lives in tents, without electricity or 
running water. 
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the rallies of the Mongolian Democratic Assn. have railed against 
government mishandling of the economy. Meat, milk and butter are in short 
supply despite 22 million head of livestock.

The Cartagena summit marked important progress toward harmonizing the 
once-disparate drug policies of the United States and the three 
cocaine-producing countries of South America, as well as reinforcing their 
resolve to fight cocaine traffic together, Latin American officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The results were precisely what we needed, a more aggressive commitment by all 
of the countries here," said Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, the commander of 
Colombia's intelligence police. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush met Thursday in Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia, 
Peru and Bolivia, the drug policies of the four countries already had evolved 
into at least the semblance of common purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government had gradually accepted the South American governments' view 
that they cannot stop cocaine traffic as long as widespread consumption by 
Americans keeps demand for the drug strong. The three South American 
governments, in turn, had acceded by degrees to the U.S. view that cocaine was 
not just an American problem and that tough police action and eradication of 
illicit coca plantations is in the Andean countries' interest. 
</P>
<P>
And both sides had come to realize that the Andean countries need outside 
economic support, including aid and favorable terms of trade, to effectively 
carry out the costly campaign against cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
By re-emphasizing those and other points of agreement, officials said, 
Thursday's summit communique, called the Declaration of Cartagena, strengthened 
a spirit of cooperation among the four governments. 
</P>
<P>
President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia said before leaving this Caribbean port 
city Friday morning that the meeting was an inspiring success. 
</P>
<P>
"May it be maintained as a shining summit for Latin Americans, leading to 
concrete achievements," Paz told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush promised to present the Cartagena meeting's call for concerted 
multinational action against drugs to the seven leading industrialized nations 
at their annual meeting in Houston next July. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine, if the Big Seven adopt the thesis of Cartagena on the integral fight 
against narcotraffic, it will mean that we have the commitment of the most 
powerful ones on the planet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III will address a United Nations special session on the 
drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is hopeful that the special session will result in a 
stronger, more balanced, multilateral role for the United Nations in drug 
control," Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who had returned from Cartagena on Thursday night, met with his Cabinet 
to brief them on the results. He waved off reporters' questions, however. In 
emphasizing that the anti-cocaine action must be multinational and coordinated, 
Paz said: "What we have said to President Bush is that we commit ourselves to 
not grow excess coca leaf, but they must commit themselves to not increase 
demand and to never again produce another addicted mayor in their capital. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, I believe this meeting has served to put things in their place," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source who asked not to be identified said a major purpose of the summit 
for the U.S. side was to get Bolivia and Peru to increase efforts for 
eradicating coca plantations. The two countries produce the bulk of the leaves 
from which cocaine is made and which are also legally chewed by Andean Indians. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, both Bolivia and Peru have repeatedly demanded greater U.S. aid in 
return for eradication, while the United States has conditioned economic aid on 
progress in eradication. The result has been much wrangling and less than full 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's hope that we have created a better climate for cooperation, that they 
won't keep harping on this dollar for dollar thing," the U.S. source said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, with a U.S. promise of increased attention to the Andean 
countries' economic needs in the Cartagena declaration, "we should have more 
leverage -- leverage is not the right word -- but more cooperation from them in 
policing their own countries." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, however, that Congress is unlikely to approve as much aid as the 
South American countries would like. 
</P>
<P>
"I would call it an increased emphasis on the economic side, but I wouldn't 
call it an Alliance for Progress or a Marshall Plan for the Andean countries," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bolivian Foreign Minister Carlos Iturralde said Friday that at least $3.5 
billion was required by his country if it is to replace 173,000 acres of coca 
leaf production . 
</P>
<P>
Julio Londono, the Colombian foreign minister, told reporters that Colombia had 
long sought more U.S. attention to the link between effective anti-drug efforts 
and economic progress in the Andean countries. The Declaration of Cartagena 
signals a change in the U.S. approach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the United States also "recognizes for the first time that consumption 
is the central, generating element of this problem" of drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes in the American point of view "seemed impossible" three years ago, 
Londono said. 
</P>
<P>
The Bogota newspaper El Espectador, which has pressed an editorial crusade 
against drug traffickers, said Friday that the summit conclusions "are a 
definitive step toward what may be the final offensive against the most 
noxious, dangerous and costly scourge afflicting humanity today." 
</P>
<P>
El Universal of Cartagena applauded U.S. commitments at the summit. "The 
promise of more economic aid for development and an increase in the intensity 
of control over internal consumption cleared the way toward harmony that . . . 
undoubtedly means a change in the great anti-drug crusade," said an editorial 
in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
But there are bound to be obstacles along the way. For one, the 
multibillion-dollar cocaine trade spawns official corruption, giving 
traffickers their most effective shield. And because the cocaine-producing 
countries are poor, their institutions are often ill-equipped to control the 
resource-rich drug business. It is not clear what amount of development aid 
might be needed to change this lopsided relationship. 
</P>
<P>
As some Colombian commentators have observed, how can the United States expect 
South American governments to control cocaine production and smuggling when it 
has been unable to control the lucrative marijuana business at home or to 
effectively prosecute its own drug barons? 
</P>
<P>
"It is hoped that in their secret conversations, the Latin American presidents 
have told these truths to Mr. Bush," wrote Ricardo Velez Parejo, an El 
Universal columnist.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sam Nujoma, a former guerrilla leader who spent 30 years in exile, was elected 
Namibia's first president Friday and will take office when the territory wins 
independence from South Africa on March 21. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma, 60, helped found the South-West Africa People's Organization in 1960 
and led it through a 23-year guerrilla war against South African rule of 
Namibia, Africa's last colony. 
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the Namibian people and myself, I want to express my sincere 
appreciation for the trust and honor you have bestowed upon me," he told the 
72-member Constituent Assembly after its unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I call on all Namibians to remain united behind our government and work 
together for peace and stability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar will swear Nujoma into office on 
Namibia's independence day. Namibia's South African administrator, Louis 
Pienaar, will remain in charge of the territory until then. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 heads of state are expected to attend the independence ceremonies. 
SWAPO leaders say they will invite both South African President Frederik W. de 
Klerk and recently released African National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma will serve for five years, then will be eligible for a second term. 
However, the constitution limits a president to two five-year terms, a rarity 
on a continent where most leaders serve for life. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed to grant the territory 
independence under a regional peace accord signed in 1988 with Angola and Cuba. 
The accord provided for the phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, 
Namibia's northern neighbor, where they were helping the Marxist government 
against UNITA rebels fighting with South African and U.S. support. 
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 U.N. military and civilian personnel have been monitoring the 
transition to independence, which began last April. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. presidential candidate Jesse Jackson attended the Assembly session 
Friday and was allowed to speak to its members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by people civilized enough to agree and disagree," Jackson told 
the assembly. "This is an example of how a democratic society can work when 
people move from polarization to coalition." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who completed an eight-day visit to South Africa on Thursday, said 
Namibia could become a "shining example" of democracy for South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist SWAPO won 41 of the Assembly seats in elections last November; six 
other parties captured the remaining 31 spots. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a hard-fought election and sharp ideological differences, the parties 
quickly worked out a democratic, Western-style constitution that was 
unanimously approved earlier this month. Also, Nujoma has named whites, 
businessmen and opposition party members to his Cabinet in a bid to heal the 
deep divisions caused by a war that lasted from 1966 until April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Nujoma has little formal education, but is considered a shrewd, instinctive 
politician who has maintained leadership of his organization despite challenges 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
He helped found the Ovamboland People's Organization, the forerunner to SWAPO, 
in the late 1950s. He went into exile in 1959 and was named president of newly 
formed SWAPO in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the movement was recognized by the United Nations as the 
"sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people" although the 
territory had dozens of political parties. 
</P>
<P>
In exile, he generally was portrayed as a Marxist but has sounded much more 
moderate since returning to Namibia in September. Even his political opponents 
have praised his efforts at reconciliation, and the transition to independence 
has gone much more smoothly than most observers expected.

ARMY EMPHASIZES URBAN WARFARE TRAINING IN WAKE OF PANAMA INVASION;

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first light, a volley of machine-gun fire erupts from the third-floor window 
of a burned-out cinder-block building, shattering the silence of Combat Town. 
</P>
<P>
Its target -- a company of paratroopers -- is breaking out of the nearby woods 
and creeping toward the city, aiming to secure a toehold from which their 
battalion can, house by house, wrest control of the settlement from a smaller 
force of rebel "Cortinians." 
</P>
<P>
The recent scene at Ft. Bragg's mock Combat Town reflects the new emphasis that 
the Army is placing on urban warfare training in the wake of the U.S. invasion 
of Panama. In the December operation, U.S. forces met some of their most 
daunting opposition from urban guerrillas holed up in the buildings and 
shantytowns of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent briefing for the Army's senior leadership, Army investigators 
identified the need for more and different kinds of urban warfare training as 
one of the principal lessons learned in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
What makes urban warfare particularly dicey is the presence of civilian 
noncombatants. In the training exercises at Combat Town, situated in the 
pine-dotted hills of North Carolina, all of the "Cortinian" civilians had fled 
and the invading soldiers did not have to worry about the possibility of 
killing noncombatants. 
</P>
<P>
But real life, as Panama demonstrated, is more complicated. So, later this 
month, when the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st Battalion storms Combat Town again 
in another round of dawn training maneuvers, it will face not just a band of 
rebels but a city full of sleeping citizens as well, perhaps played by Army 
dependents and out-of-uniform soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Panama situation has emphasized the need to work the civilian side of 
things," including the handling of prisoners of war and bystanders, Col. Glynn 
Hale, commander of the 1st Battalion, said. 
</P>
<P>
At Ft. Bragg, where some of the nation's "first-to-fight" units are based, that 
means increased training for "military operations in urban terrain," in Army 
parlance. Although many Army units get to practice urban combat only once or 
twice a year, the 1st Battalion has fought its way into Ft. Bragg's Combat Town 
six times in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
With the addition of noncombatants to the training exercises, units like the 
82nd Airborne hope to learn how to use their firepower more discriminately, 
adding risk and complexity to an already dangerous and painstaking task. 
</P>
<P>
And there is no question that battles fought in the smoke, rubble and close 
quarters of a city are deadly to soldiers and civilians alike. In last week's 
training session, for example, the 700 soldiers of the 1st Battalion secured 
Combat Town after nearly four hours of fighting, but at a "loss" of 22 U.S. 
dead and 46 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon estimated that 220 civilians were killed during the U.S. invasion 
of Panama, most of them in the cities and shantytowns that provided shelter and 
anonymity to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's loyalists. The casualties were high even 
though the operation's commanders placed tight limits on how, when and what 
kinds of force U.S. troops might use. 
</P>
<P>
"Operation Just Cause, like many of the counter-narcotics missions the Army may 
be asked to perform in the future, involved restrictive rules of engagement," 
Maj. Blair Ross said, referring to the guidelines that dictate whether, how and 
when soldiers may use deadly force. 
</P>
<P>
"So we now have this new focus, this new need to make sure that we're familiar 
with operations under those circumstances," said Ross, a brigade operations 
officer in the 82nd Airborne Division who designed and oversaw last week's 
Combat Town maneuvers. "It's something that we're certainly going to have to 
adjust ourselves to. We haven't practiced much with restrictive rules of 
engagement." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most of the Army's urban warfare training assumes scenarios far 
different from those confronted in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Army's largest mock urban combat site is a 189-acre facility in West Berlin 
called Doughboy City, where Army forces practice operations against organized 
tank armies that resemble Warsaw Pact forces, not Third World rebel troops. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maj. Pete Pierce, a spokesman for the U.S. Command in Berlin, the 
Doughboy City facility does not use "extras" to simulate the presence of 
civilian populations. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama brought a lot of things back into focus," said Col. Bob Harkins, 
director of training and doctrine at the Army Infantry School at Ft. Benning, 
Ga. "In Vietnam, we didn't really fight much in the city, and everybody after 
that tended to put urban warfare training in the European context." 
</P>
<P>
That assumption was initially questioned by the Army's top brass after the 
Israelis discovered the costs associated with going into Beirut during their 
invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Pentagon planners began to recognize that Third 
World cities, from Tehran to Seoul to Managua, had become crucibles of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the population trends throughout the Third World, the prospect for urban 
warfare has actually increased markedly over the past several decades," said 
Augustus Richard Norton, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West 
Point, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to say we'd better be preparing for these Third World conflicts," he 
said. "But it's hard to design training to prepare soldiers for this, because 
it's a gut-wrenchingly hard kind of warfare to prepare for. It's not like 
training to fight large tanks, where, if you have enough room and gas, you can 
prepare for anything." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Army Infantry School was directed to review its urban warfare 
training, which had assumed new significance with the creation in 1983 of 
special light infantry divisions designed for rapid deployment to operations 
like Panama. 
</P>
<P>
By last November, amid intensive preparations for the Panama invasion, the 
reassessment had borne fruit at the Army Joint Readiness Training Center at Ft. 
Chaffee, Ark., where the Army pioneers new training techniques for the nation's 
rapid-deployment forces. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, soldiers in two-week urban warfare exercises at Ft. Chaffee 
began to face civilian role-players extensively and to receive daily changes in 
the rules of engagement under which troops operate. 
</P>
<P>
The new techniques -- bolstered by the U.S. experience in Panama -- already are 
finding their way into the normal training routines of other Army units, such 
as the 1st Battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division's 505th Brigade at Ft. 
Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
The Panama invasion has also taught the Army other lessons that will affect the 
equipment it uses for training and for battle in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional and Pentagon sources said that the 82nd Airborne's 1960s-vintage 
Sheridan tanks, which are lighter than more modern tanks, negotiated Panama 
City's rubble-strewn streets better than the lightly armored wheeled vehicles 
used by the Marines in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheridan's performance is likely to affect a heated debate on Capitol Hill 
over the size, shape and armor of the Army's and Marines' next fighting 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think someone here will probably insist we have a tracked vehicle to 
(succeed) the Sheridan," one Ft. Bragg officer said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, training experts said that, if soldiers are to practice not 
killing bystanders, they must be equipped with simulated hand grenades and mock 
tank and artillery rounds that will accurately show how many people -- 
civilians and otherwise -- are killed in a unit's efforts to secure a building. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only the M-16 rifle and some Army machine guns are equipped with 
laser devices that allow soldiers to "shoot" without live ammunition and know 
whether they have hit or missed. 
</P>
<P>
Because hand grenades and small building-shattering rockets are among the most 
commonly used urban weapons, the Army Infantry School's Harkins said, they, 
too, should be equipped with devices to enable soldiers in training to show how 
many people they kill when they lob such explosives into a room. 
</P>
<P>
"We're more aware of the construction of a building," and the nature of its 
occupants, since Panama, said Capt. David Woolf, commander of the 1st 
Battalion's Charlie Company, during the recent exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much easier to stand off and just plaster something," he said. "But, 
in places like Panama, that just isn't an option."

CRANSTON ENTREATS AUDIENCE TO GIVE HIS BLACK EYE ANOTHER LOOK 
</P>

By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER

<P>
CORONADO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston, himself a former news reporter, asked California's 
newspaper publishers on Friday to think how they would have handled the Charles 
Keating savings and loan affair -- a scandal that has dogged the senator for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as I've been in your shoes, let me ask you to wear mine for a minute," 
Cranston said. "Pretend you are a United States senator from California." 
</P>
<P>
As the beleaguered four-term senator framed it, his intervening on behalf of 
Keating's now-defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan was unrelated to political 
contributions. It was not a matter of favoritism that led Cranston and other 
senators to sit down with federal regulators handling the case, he said. None 
of it was even out of the ordinary, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"What would you do if a businessman heading a very large operation in 
California came to you and said that his business, with 740 California 
employees and more than 120,000 depositors, was being harassed and given the 
runaround by the federal bureaucracy?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, a foreign correspondent for the International News Service in the 
1930s and 1940s,added: "I know how little good it does to argue with a 
reporter, or an editor or a publisher." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Cranston devoted nearly half of his speech to the annual convention of 
the California Newspaper Publishers Assn. to the Keating affair -- and the 
political black eye it has given him. 
</P>
<P>
Rather boldly, Cranston suggested that if he could convince publishers they 
would have acted as he did, "perhaps your papers will begin to reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's problem stems from the fact that he and four other senators 
intervened with federal regulators at the time they were investigating 
Keating's Lincoln Savings. All of the senators were recipients of political 
contributions from Keating and associates -- with Cranston receiving the most, 
$47,000 in campaign contributions and $850,000 for voter registration drives. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has since gone into receivership. And about 22,000 of its depositors 
face the loss of their savings because they purchased bonds at Lincoln 
branches, apparently unaware the bonds were uninsured and risky. And Cranston's 
standing in public opinion polls has plummeted, with 69% of those answering the 
recent California Poll saying they would not vote to reelect him to a fifth 
term in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he recognized "that the $850,000 I raised from Keating for 
registration is a huge amount of money. Some people think it was too much to 
have raised from one man." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "Not a penny of any of Mr. Keating's money went into my pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's address marked the 33rd straight year he has spoken to the 
publishers' convention. He noted, though, it was the first time he had been 
asked to deliver the keynote address.

If it takes the kind of controversy he is knotted up in to get such an

FEINSTEIN JABS AT HER OPPONENTS, DRAWS APPLAUSE FROM PUBLISHERS

California newspaper publishers meeting here Friday got their first look at the 
three candidates for governor on the same podium -- John, Pete and Buster. 
</P>
<P>
Buster? That's what Democrat Dianne Feinstein's staff is calling her after her 
recent surge in a statewide poll and her blunt criticism of her opponents, 
Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Republican U. S. Sen. Pete 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Like the new heavyweight boxing champ, James (Buster) Douglas, Feinstein 
sparred a few rounds Friday and then threw a big punch: "On issues of 
principle, California's next governor can't be for what he's against, and 
against what he's for." 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to Van de Kamp's personal opposition to capital punishment 
at the same time as he is urging the state to get on with the long-delayed 
executions of those on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general, who had spoken before Feinstein, sat fuming nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Francisco mayor's comment was as close as any of the three came 
to breaking out of the meeting's rigid format and addressing each other 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
As for Van de Kamp's strategy to build his gubernatorial campaign around three 
ballot initiatives, Feinstein said, "The question is, can initiatives 
substitute for leadership? . . . Look at Prop. 103 on auto insurance. A court 
recently gave the insurance companies rights they didn't have before." 
</P>
<P>
For Wilson, Feinstein had this to say: "The job we are running for is governor 
of our state -- the chief executive officer, not the chief fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had raised a whopping $8.2 million for his campaign as of Jan. 1, 
dwarfing the amounts collected by the Van de Kamp and Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 executives of the California Newspaper Publishers Assn. and spouses 
listened intently to all three candidates, but they gave their strongest 
applause to Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
The first -- and loudest -- hand-clapping came when Feinstein responded to a 
question about whether the death penalty helps deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is a deterrent," she said. "It's a terrible commentary on 
society, but I'm afraid we have reached the point where some people, by their 
acts, do give up their right to survive." 
</P>
<P>
There was more applause when Feinstein challenged a questioner's assertion that 
capital punishment is barbaric and ineffectual. 
</P>
<P>
"I would characterize your analysis as incorrect," Feinstein shot back, and the 
room burst into applause. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," Feinstein continued, "we're all for the disadvantaged, but I would 
submit to you that the 2 1/2-year-old baby in Watts who is shot in the head is 
disadvantaged. I would submit to you that the 85-year-old woman raped and 
murdered in a convalescent hospital is disadvantaged. . . . The serial murders 
did not take place with the abandon of today when there was in fact a death 
penalty in place." 
</P>
<P>
And if Van de Kamp had hoped that the controversial Hillside Strangler case 
would not come up Friday, Feinstein disappointed him when she added, in 
comments supporting the death penalty: "We wouldn't have the Hillside 
Stranglers -- one of whom is now married and having conjugal visits -- when 
there are 10 young women who were brutally killed." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono, who were convicted of the Los 
Angeles Hillside Strangler slayings, faced the death penalty but were given 
life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp has been criticized for not seeking a murder conviction for Buono 
when Van de Kamp was district attorney of Los Angeles County. A judge overruled 
Van de Kamp's motion to dismiss the case and it was eventually tried by the 
office of then-Atty. Gen. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
When a member of the audience brought that up Friday, Van de Kamp responded, 
"That proves I made a mistake. It does not prove I am soft on crime." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp added, in a reference to the charge that 1988 Democratic 
presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis coddled criminals: "Unlike Gov. 
Dukakis, when he ran for the presidency, I have a record in this particular 
area." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general defended his ballot initiatives on the environment, ethics 
and drug-war funds by saying, "I want to ask people to join me in making change 
happen, to judge me not by what I say but by what I do to change California." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp said he has already gathered more than 1 million signatures for his 
three ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
Crime being the favorite topic of the day, Wilson, when he spoke, called for 
passage of the Crime Victims Justice Reform Initiative on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
He also called for "truth in sentencing," saying, "Citizens of this state for 
the most part do not know and would be shocked to learn that the average felon 
in California, once convicted, actually serves half the sentence to which he 
has been sentenced." 
</P>
<P>
The two-term senator and former mayor of San Diego also touted his long record 
of public service in a speech that drew no applause. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers John Balzar and George Skelton contributed to this report.

4.1 QUAKE RATTLES SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mild earthquake jolted parts of San Bernardino County on Friday night, but no 
damage or injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor, which struck at 7:45 p.m., registered magnitude 4.1, officials at 
the state Office of Emergency Services said. 
</P>
<P>
The epicenter was about six miles northwest of Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Dispatchers at the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said they did not 
feel the tremor. Many area residents also did not notice the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even feel it," said Debby Chormicle, a clerk at a 7-Eleven store at 
Crestline. "It didn't shake anything off the shelves."

United Mine Workers strikers won concessions on health care and pension 
benefits and Pittston Coal Group got the ability to run its mines almost 
nonstop in a proposed settlement distributed to miners Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the UMW's rank-and-file in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky, 
the settlement could resolve the union's bitter and sporadically violent 10 
1/2-month strike against the nation's largest coal exporter by next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press obtained a copy of the proposed contract from a source who 
requested anonymity. Union members are due to vote on the pact Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Pittston would be able to hire contract truck drivers and 
maintenance workers, as long as union miners are not laid off. And Pittston 
would be able to run its mines on an around-the-clock, seven-days-a-week basis, 
except for Christmas and the day shift on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
The UMW won its demand to maintain 100% medical coverage for employees, 
pensioners and their families. Pittston also agreed to resume making 
contributions to the union pension fund.

BUSH SIGNS LAW ON STATE DEPT. PROGRAMS, INSISTS HE IS NOT BOUND BY PORTIONS OF 
IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush on Friday signed into a law a measure governing State Department 
programs for the next two years, but said he would not consider himself bound 
by several provisions that White House lawyers claim infringe on presidential 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
The move was significant as part of a continuing campaign by Bush to bolster 
presidential privileges that he contends have been eroded in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush's action stopped well short of asserting a so-called line-item veto 
over legislation -- the power to nullify certain parts of a congressionally 
passed measure while signing the rest. Administration officials have said Bush 
is looking for a bill that he could use as a test case on a line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of anything that drastic, in this case Bush issued a three-page 
statement late in the day here after he arrived for a three-day vacation. The 
statement said the President simply would interpret the provisions he objected 
to as "advisory," not binding. Both Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter 
took similar stands in similar circumstances and Bush as well has issued 
similar statements in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The law in question is tailor-made for these sorts of disputes about the 
relative powers of the executive and legislative branches because a quarrel 
over it would have few practical consequences. The bill is what is known as an 
authorization measure, a law that sets ground rules for certain programs, in 
this case nearly $10 billion of State Department programs this year and next. 
</P>
<P>
But the way the government is set up, those programs would continue in effect 
whether the authorization were in place or not. By contrast, disputes over 
appropriations measures -- the laws which actually provide money for programs 
-- can cause serious disruptions because the government is not allowed to spend 
money if an appropriation has not been signed. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that difference, Congress and the executive branch both usually try 
to avoid fights over appropriations bills while using authorizations to make 
political statements. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, for example, one provision of the bill prohibits U.S. 
representatives from conducting Middle East peace negotiations with any 
representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization who has "directly 
participated" in a "terrorist activity which resulted in the death or kidnaping 
of a United States citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Voting for that provision had an obvious political advantage for members of 
Congress who proposed it, allowing them to say they had taken a stand against 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, however, takes the position that the Constitution gives the President the 
sole right to decide whom to negotiate with. In Friday's statement, he said 
that while he does not plan to negotiate with terrorists, he would not be 
constrained by Congress telling him not to. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also includes two provisions relating to China. One enacts into law 
sanctions on China that Bush already has imposed by executive order. In a 
compromise worked out earlier, the bill gives Bush flexibility to waive the 
sanctions when he sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
The second provision, aimed at last year's "secret mission" of Administration 
officials to Beijing, would require the State Department to notify Congress of 
such trips in the future. But the bill does not impose a specific deadline for 
making such reports. In his statement, Bush said he was "concerned that such 
provisions tend to undermine the spirit of cooperation and trust between the 
executive and legislative branches."

TRUCKS, CAR PILE UP IN FREEWAY TUNNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six big-rig trucks and a car slammed into each other Friday evening in a 
chain-reaction pileup at the end of a rain-slicked tunnel on the Golden State 
Freeway near Newhall, authorities said. Two occupants in the car were injured, 
one seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The pileup occurred at 7 p.m. when a truck nearing the tunnel's exit skidded on 
the wet pavement and jackknifed, causing other trucks to crash as they came 
around a blind curve, said California Highway Patrol Officer Louie Pravettone. 
The car, a Volkswagen hatchback, struck the back of the last truck in the 
pileup about a minute after the initial crash, Pravettone said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, described as in his 20s, was arrested on suspicion of 
drunk driving after officers found several open cans of beer in the car and 
smelled alcohol on his breath, Pravettone said. The driver suffered moderate 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
None of the truck drivers were injured in the crash, which occurred in the 
southbound truck lanes below the Antelope Valley Freeway overpass, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the crash scene as chaotic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was coming around the corner and I saw a bunch of metal flying and saw a 
little car crash into the back of a truck," said Don Vogt, 43, who swerved his 
loaded tanker-trailer rig and avoided hitting the car. "It was just all crazy. 
Trucks and cars were going all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
Pravettone said the passenger in the car was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center 
in Mission Hills. The driver was being treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital in Valencia. Their names were not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel was expected to be closed for several hours until the wreckage could 
be cleared, Pravettone said. Southbound trucks were being diverted to car 
lanes.

OILY 'MOUSSE' WASHES ASHORE NEAR TIDE POOLS 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an extensive effort to mop up the last of the 394,000-gallon oil spill was 
being scaled back Friday afternoon, a light foam of oil began washing ashore 
between Crystal Cove State Beach and Abalone Point. 
</P>
<P>
The news sent local officials and about 40 cleanup workers scrambling to keep 
the oil, which was spilled last week, from entering the tide pools that teem 
with sea life along the rocky coastline. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the consistency of chocolate mousse, only a little foamier," 
said Bob Scruggs of the Laguna Beach Fire Department, who is coordinating the 
response for the South County beach cities. "It's really hard to clean out of 
there with the tide action." 
</P>
<P>
The effort ended a short time later, however, because, officials said, it was 
too dark to continue working in that remote stretch of beach. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup work crews were reduced Friday to about 600 people throughout the 
affected area, down from the more than 1,200 that had been working Thursday. 
Only three skimmers remained to take oil off the ocean service, whereas there 
had been dozens earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
The oil, Alaskan crude, spilled from the tanker American Trader Feb. 7 after 
the ship's own anchor gashed its hull in the waters off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said, however, that they are keeping many cleanup workers on call 
over the weekend because there is a threat of rain. An Alaskan cold front that 
has been moving south this week is expected to arrive in the Southland, dumping 
as much as an inch of rain on the area. 
</P>
<P>
That would be bad news for those concerned about keeping the oil-tainted 
seawater from leading to the environmentally sensitive Huntington Beach 
wetlands. Environmentalists and cleanup workers have been keeping a watchful 
eye on a temporary earthen dam built last week to keep the oily water from the 
mouth of the Santa Ana River, which leads to the wetlands. Officials decided to 
breach the dam to the Talbert Channel on Friday by lowering it four feet. This 
was done, they said, because any storm water could cause flooding upstream. But 
lowering the dam is a calculated risk to the wildlife on the other side of the 
marshlands that the dam was designed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gamble," said Gordon Smith, director of the Huntington Beach Wetlands 
Conservancy. "I'm concerned that if we have a really heavy storm, it will sweep 
the berm away. It could wash out completely and leave us exposed to a 
considerable amount of oil on the rocks." 
</P>
<P>
The spill has so far affected 14 miles of beach and forced closures of the 
entrances to the Newport and Huntington harbors in Orange County and the Long 
Beach Marina in Los Angeles County. Officials say some of the beaches along 
that 14-mile stretch will not reopen to the public until next month at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, all we've been able to say is they'll be open March 7," Huntington 
Beach lifeguard Steve Reuter said. "Seal Beach is open, so if you want to surf, 
go to Seal Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Fire Department Capt. Ray Pendleton said, "If we allowed people 
back on the beaches, we'd have a problem with them trampling the oil into the 
sand." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton also said visitors would be in the way of cleanup equipment still on 
the sands. "We don't want to get someone run over by any of these front 
loaders." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials flew over the area several times Friday to survey the 
damage. They saw a light sheen extending from Huntington Beach to Reef Point 
near Corona del Mar, they said. The slick was concentrated in an area about two 
miles south of Huntington Beach, although fingers of oil spread out from that 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three skimmers, one was working off Reef Point and two others were 
moving between Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real light," Coast Guard Petty Officer Carolyn Feldman said of the oil. 
"They're just trying to pick up what they can." 
</P>
<P>
The sheen indicates a very light transparent oil, officials said. Such a light 
layer is difficult for the skimmers to pick up. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also said that "extra-light oil" is still washing up on Bolsa Chica 
State Beach and that there continues to be "light contamination" from the Santa 
Ana River in Huntington Beach to 55th Street in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said her office has received dozens of calls asking whether the cruise, 
whale-watching and fishing boats still inside the booms would be allowed to go 
out during the weekend, she said. The answer, so far, is no. However, the 
entrances to the Alamitos Bay and the San Gabriel River between Seal Beach and 
Long Beach were reopened Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman advised that boaters listen to radio reports on Marine Channel 22 for 
updated information. 
</P>
<P>
Although the cleanup crews have been scaled back, Huntington Beach Mayor Tom 
Mays said at a press briefing Friday morning that "this disaster is far from 
over." He predicted there will be several more weeks of cleanup work. 
</P>
<P>
At the briefing with Mays was State Controller Gray Davis, who called on Gov. 
George Deukmejian to declare a disaster. The governor said earlier in the week 
that private efforts have been so successful in cleaning up the spill that 
there is no need to declare a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe he has not shown the interest or the compassion or the 
humanity to drive 15 minutes down here from his home in Long Beach to see the 
situation," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Kozlowski, a spokesman for British Petroleum, whose oil the tanker was 
carrying, said the remaining work crews are concentrating their efforts along 
the shores of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski said there were 270 crew members working in Newport Beach, 90 in the 
area between the Santa Ana River and Newland Street in Huntington Beach, 35 at 
the mouth of the Santa Ana River and 75 at Crystal Cove just south of 
Huntington Beach. The remainder were scattered in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski also said Friday that the cleanup has cost the company about $10 
million so far. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Weisser of the state Fish and Game Department said that 224 birds were 
killed because of the spill but that 384 have been rescued. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have been looking at the episode to determine whether 
criminal charges should be filed. Coast Guard Cmdr. Scott Porter said Justice 
Department representatives have been visiting the area all week to get updates 
on the various investigations into the incident.

SUITS AGAINST GATES COST COUNTY ANOTHER $475,000

The county has paid a local private investigator and his lawyers $475,000 to 
end an 11-year court battle over whether Sheriff Brad Gates harassed his 
critics with an elite intelligence unit and improperly handed out gun permits 
to his cronies. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the litigation said Friday that the payment is part of a 
settlement of two federal civil-rights lawsuits brought by Preston Guillory 
that have cost the county about $1 million in payouts and attorneys' fees since 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
All the details of the settlement agreement -- still awaiting public approval 
by the Board of Supervisors -- have yet to be revealed, although supervisors 
met in executive session to consider the settlement two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The payout represents the second time in the last four years the county has 
agreed to settle for substantial amounts cases alleging that Gates used his 
department to investigate political enemies and court opponents. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, the county paid $375,000 in 1987 to former Orange County 
Municipal Judge Bobby D. Youngblood, an outspoken opponent of Gates and 
one-time candidate for sheriff. Gates denied any wrongdoing during the case and 
contended that his department had a legitimate basis to suspect Youngblood of 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the award with Youngblood were private investigator Patrick Bland and 
Rancho Santiago College instructor George P. Wright, another Gates critic who 
claimed undercover deputies spied on his criminal justice class. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the current settlement, Guillory, 45, of Santa Ana gets about 
$290,000, while his lawyers, Michael Cisarik and Meir J. Westreich, get about 
$185,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 14-page agreement, Gates, Guillory, county officials and 
attorneys for both sides are barred from discussing the case until mid-March 
when a formal announcement of the settlement is scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Guillory is barred from disclosing to the public evidence he 
gathered in preparation of one of the settled lawsuits. The case, filed in 1979 
after Guillory was denied a concealed weapons permit, charged that the process 
Gates uses to grant gun permits is capricious and riddled with favoritism. 
Gates denied it. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the confidentiality order, Guillory and Cisarik declined to discuss the 
agreement. Gates and his attorney, Eric L. Dobberteen, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
But, sources said, formal announcement of the settlement is tentatively 
scheduled for sometime after the March 9 deadline to declare candidacies for 
sheriff. Gates, seeking his fifth four-year term, is now unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Padberg, a longtime political consultant for Gates, denied there was any 
effort to delay announcing the Guillory settlement for political advantage. "I 
am certainly not aware of any planned action," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Padberg said she did not know if news of the settlement would prompt anyone to 
run against Gates, but, she added, candidates have decided to enter the 
sheriff's race for far less significant reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, when announced, will end an acrimonious decade of litigation in 
U.S. District Court that has embroiled Gates in some of the worst controversy 
of his 16-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
One Guillory lawsuit alleged that Gates' gun permit procedure was so fraught 
with cronyism that it denied Guillory the constitutional right of due process. 
The other lawsuit charged that Gates investigated Guillory because of the gun 
permit case and Guillory's work on behalf of one of the sheriff's political 
opponents. Gates has denied any impropriety. The gun-permit lawsuit was headed 
for trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
In the other case, a federal jury awarded Guillory $189,894 in damages last 
March on the grounds that Gates improperly investigated Guillory in 1984 
shortly after Guillory served a subpoena on a confidential Sheriff's Department 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Guillory was working as an private investigator for Judge 
Youngblood, who needed Guillory to find witnesses and evidence for his own 
lawsuit alleging that Gates' underlings investigated him for eight years 
without cause. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators helped develop a criminal case against Guillory on 
misdemeanor charges that he impersonated a police officer and carried a 
concealed weapon without a permit when he subpoenaed the informant. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies claimed they had substantial evidence of wrongdoing to justify an 
investigation. Guillory, however, was acquitted of all charges in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
After Guillory won the harassment suit, attorneys for the Sheriff's Department 
appealed the jury verdict. Similarly, Guillory's lawyers appealed portions of 
the lawsuit they did not prevail on in court. Meanwhile, U.S. District Court 
Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. awarded Guillory's lawyers $116,192 in attorney 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
other. 
</P>
<P>
Had the gun-permit lawsuit gone to trial, Guillory has said, he was prepared to 
provide evidence from an investigation of 2,000 concealed weapons permits 
issued by the Sheriff's Department between 1975 and mid-1987. 
</P>
<P>
His research purportedly shows that Gates gave out almost 200 gun permits to 
business associates, friends and political supporters who contributed a total 
of $121,000 to his campaign coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory, who is under a court order not to reveal the names of permit holders, 
further alleges that Gates issued 137 gun permits to people who have at least 
one arrest on charges ranging from drunken driving to lewd conduct. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he has said he compiled driver's license information and voter 
registration records indicated that 10 people have been issued gun permits 
although they lived out of Orange County. They include a rancher in Texas and 
Michael Wayne, son of actor John Wayne, both longtime political supporters of 
Gates.

UCI'S TIEN STEPS INTO CENTER OF DEBATE ABOUT ASIAN STEREOTYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stereotype has lurked behind the controversy over the allegations of 
anti-Asian bias in UC Berkeley's admissions policies: Asian-Americans as 
academic super-achievers. 
</P>
<P>
Discipline and other cultural factors have propelled Asian-Americans to 
extraordinary successes in higher education. But, Asian-American activists say, 
bigots resent their achievement and fear universities will be overrun by Asian 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Into the debate steps Chang-Lin Tien, the UC Irvine executive vice chancellor 
who was named Thursday as the next chancellor of UC Berkeley. Tien is the first 
Asian-American to head a UC campus and may be the first to lead any major 
research university. He and his family make no apologies for the super-achiever 
image. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is a super-achiever and can accomplish anything," Masayoshi 
Tomizuka, a mechanical engineering professor at UC Berkeley, said of the man 
who was once his colleague and will soon be his boss. "Aggressive might not be 
a good word, but he is very outgoing." 
</P>
<P>
Tien, 54, and his wife, Di-Hwa, have two daughters and a son. All three 
children graduated from UC Berkeley and are enrolled in tough graduate 
programs: Norman in microelectronics at UC San Diego, Phyllis at UC San Diego 
Medical School and Kristine at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
Earning multiple degrees is a family tradition. Tien was born the son of a 
banker in pre-revolutionary China. He earned an undergraduate degree in 
mechanical engineering from National Taiwan University, a master's from the 
University of Louisville (where, as a nonwhite, he felt anguish in the 
segregated South of the 1950s), and a second master's and a Ph.D. from 
Princeton University. All by age 24. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to a long and prize-winning career in teaching and research, 
specializing in heat-transfer technology, at UC Berkeley, eventually becoming 
vice chancellor for research there. He was praised for his efforts to help 
improve -- after much controversy -- conditions for laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
Tien has been second in command at UC Irvine since 1988. Administrators, staff 
members and students there credit Tien with initiating a number of innovative 
programs, particularly in regard to affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference on the UC Irvine campus Friday, however, Tien talked 
modestly about his accomplishments and the role he played at the school, saying 
that Chancellor Jack W. Peltason deserves much of the credit for the advances 
made during Tien's 18 months at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"We initiated a number of initiatives in terms of getting cultural diversity, " 
Tien said of the efforts he made with Peltason. "Again, I must emphasize that 
many things were not initiated by me. . . . I don't think my leaving will 
affect any of the programs or impact on their completion. The institution will 
go on." 
</P>
<P>
He also gave thanks for the support he received during his tenure. "I feel the 
community here and the faculty, students and staff have been extraordinarily 
generous and kind to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Joseph Frisch, who worked with Tien in the mechanical engineering 
department at UC Berkeley, described him as a bright, friendly and hard-working 
man "who can be very hard-nosed if he has to be." 
</P>
<P>
"He is not the typical engineer," Frisch said. "He is not just a 
problem-solver. I think he has a very good understanding of psychology." 
</P>
<P>
Ling-chi Wang, chairman of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, said that Tien, a 
naturalized American citizen, "is not the stereotype of the Chinese scholar 
being very reserved, very dignified, very soft-spoken; nor is he the stereotype 
of the aggressive white executive slapping people on the back. He is sort of in 
between." 
</P>
<P>
Tien takes over at UC Berkeley July 1. Among his challenges will be to replace 
the large number of professors expected to retire within the next few years and 
to raise the number of minority teachers at the school while maintaining the 
school's worldwide reputation for excellence. He also will inherit a federal 
investigation into allegations of ethnic bias in admissions. The federal 
inquiry comes after several state and university investigations that turned up 
nothing conclusive. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any world-class university can achieve excellence without 
diversity," said Tien, who still has a strong Chinese accent. "So diversity and 
excellence must come hand-in-hand."

ICY STORM WILL MAKE WEEKEND A WET ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cold, wet storm that flooded streets in the Bay Area and dumped heavy snow in 
the Sierra slipped into Southern California on Friday, producing prospects of 
rain, cool temperatures and unsettled weather over the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The new storm, spawned in the Gulf of Alaska, trailed another Arctic-born 
weather front that chilled Southern Californians with subnormal low 
temperatures earlier this week and then moved on without producing much 
moisture. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it's setting up a breezy, cool and wet weekend for the 
Southland," said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of WeatherData Inc., which 
provides forecasts for The Times. "Rain is likely from Los Angeles to San Diego 
on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Dittmann said, he expects more showers on Sunday and early Monday, 
when he thinks clearing will begin. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann urged motorists driving to Sierra ski areas to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it's going to be snowing in the mountains through the weekend," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings of blizzard conditions were issued Friday for travelers heading for 
the mountains in Northern California. Winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h. were 
swirling "very heavy snow" in the Lake Tahoe area. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell as low as the 1,000-foot level in the Sierra foothills in northern 
Sacramento County. 
</P>
<P>
Even sled dog races scheduled this weekend in Truckee were postponed because of 
the blinding snow. 
</P>
<P>
Busy Interstate 80 was closed Friday from the Nevada state line west to Auburn, 
Calif., after snowplow operators said they could not keep up with the rapid 
accumulation of more than an inch an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Most other Sierra highways were impassable, and chains or snow tires were 
recommended just to navigate city streets in Reno and Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Peacock, spokesman for the Reno Cannon International Airport, said about 
half a dozen airplanes were able to land or depart from the facility early 
Friday before visibility became too limited for operations to continue. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning in the Owens Valley 
because of snow and wind. 
</P>
<P>
As the storm moved through the Bay Area, the weather service reported flooded 
streets in urban areas. Monterey was hit with heavy rain and winds up to 65 
m.p.h. Residents were warned of possible mud slides. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Water Resources, which estimates that California now 
has about a 50-50 chance of having another "critical" year of subnormal 
precipitation, welcomed the rain and snow. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of snow in the mountains," spokesman Don Yoeman said. 
"It's a good storm. It's hard to get a handle on it right now . . . but it's 
not going to cure our drought situation." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County agriculture officials welcomed the forecast for rain, which in 
addition to alleviating drought conditions would prevent freezes like the one 
that occurred earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
"We need every drop of rain we can get," said Howard Garrett, the county's 
deputy agriculture commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, only 4.19 inches of rain have fallen so far this rainy season, 
compared to 7.46 inches last year and the normal rainfall of 8.48 inches, 
according to WeatherData's statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The California Farm Bureau said strawberries in Orange County are turning brown 
because of the cold. Growers have tried to protect their crops of avocados and 
oranges with wind machines and water, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Edwards, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission, 
estimated that about one-third of the county's strawberry crop has been lost to 
frost. He also said that growers of ornamental nursery plants may lose most of 
their stock. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials estimated that a two-night freeze in Ventura County caused 
about $24 million in crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
About 5% to 10% of the county's nearly $400-million-a-year citrus, avocado and 
strawberry industries was ruined by temperatures that dropped into the 20s on 
Wednesday and Thursday nights, according to preliminary estimates by the 
Ventura County agricultural commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Agricultural Commissioner David Buettner characterized the 
estimated losses as moderate compared to more than $51 million in damage caused 
by a severe December, 1987, freeze. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, Sierra Pacific Power Co. said an equipment failure cut 
power to nearly all its customers across northern Nevada and in the eastern 
Sierra portion of California. An estimated 230,000 homes and businesses were 
without power. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mike Reed said crews were battling heavy drifts to reach substations, 
and service was being slowly restored at 4:45 p.m., one hour after the outage 
began.

UCI SHANTYTOWN COMES DOWN;

<P>
After 10 days and several chilly nights, student activists at UC Irvine on 
Friday dismantled a cardboard shantytown erected outside the Administration 
Building to protest the university's housing policy. 
</P>
<P>
The shanties -- which originally were intended to be part of a one-night 
protest -- were broken down shortly after a group of more than two dozen 
students went to Chancellor Jack W. Peltason's office to deliver a seven-point 
list of demands, insisting that gays, lesbians and other "non-traditional" 
couples be given the same status as married couples in the university's housing 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The shantytown protest was launched Jan. 31 after Peltason said the university 
never had a policy exception that allowed homosexual or other unmarried couples 
to room in campus family housing. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's student letter, signed by a coalition of student groups called the 
Shantytown Committee, ended with a threat of "general civil disobedience," 
including the reconstruction of the shantytown, if Peltason does not respond to 
the demands by March 3. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to go up to the administration with our demands, and if they don't 
respond we're going to come back and we're going to be ugly," Napoleon Lustre, 
a member of the Shantytown Committee, told a group of cheering students at a 
lunchtime rally. Chants of "Ugly! Ugly! Ugly!" rose from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was accepted by Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Horace Mitchell. 
Peltason was not in his office when the student protesters arrived and was 
unavailable for comment later. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't comment on the demands because they're directed at the chancellor," 
Mitchell said. "They've asked for a response by March 3, and he'll do that." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the letter demanded that the university implement the 
recommendations of a ad hoc committee appointed by Peltason to study gay and 
lesbian issues. The recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
* Hire a full-time advocate for the gay and lesbian community to be a counselor 
for homosexual students and a liaison with the university administration. 
</P>
<P>
* More representation of the homosexual community in the faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
* Guarantee equal access to graduate and family housing for gays and lesbians 
and provide "the same privileges and benefits" as married students in all 
aspects of campus affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The letter concluded: "A direct response signifying your commitment to these 
demands together with concrete proposals for implementation must be made to the 
Shantytown Committee by March 3, 1990, or else we will assume a state of 
hostility exists between the Chancellor and the UCI community. Actions 
including the resumption of the Shantytown and general civil disobedience will 
be implemented if you fail to respond to our demands." 
</P>
<P>
Garret Green, co-chairman of the Gay and Lesbian Student Union, said protesters 
decided to dismantle the shantytown "to preserve our strength" for possible 
future demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to go away just because the cardboard boxes aren't here," 
Green said in a speech to onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Green told The Times that the growth of the shantytown from a one-night 
protest site to a 10-day camp-out was "a symbol that we succeeded." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not admitting defeat," Green said. "We actually have been more 
successful than we hoped to be." 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Sowell, also a leader of the Gay and Lesbian Students Union and a 
member of the Shantytown Committee, said activists also believed that they had 
won a small victory with the announcement that UCI Executive Vice Chancellor 
Chang-Lin Tien was named chancellor of UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the protests, students praised Tien for listening to their demands 
and viewed him as a friend of their movement. One sign posted at the rally 
Friday read, "Congratulations Vice Chancellor Tien. Take Our Issue to 
Berkeley." 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held about an hour before the rally to discuss his 
appointment to Berkeley, Tien said he had no plans to institute changes in 
housing policy there. Protesters said changes at Berkeley would carry more 
weight within the UC system and would eventually trickle down to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Chancellor Peltason and Vice Chancellor Mitchell have dealt with this problem, 
and I was being consulted all the time," Tien said. "I'm in full support of the 
institutional policy and the procedures." 
</P>
<P>
But Sowell dismissed Tien's statement as "just his public position" and said 
she was confident that he was working behind the scenes towards changing the 
housing policy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a volatile issue," Sowell said. "I doubt anyone wants to be publicly 
involved with it, especially an incoming chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
Judy Olson, vice president for internal affairs of the Associated Graduate 
Students, said she believed that most of the top administrators, including 
Mitchell and Tien, were sympathetic with the students' demands. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe it's just the chancellor (who opposes the demands)," Olson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she stuck with the shantytown for the duration because it was 
"the right thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm wearing the clothes I slept in last night, and I haven't had a shower and 
I haven't brushed my teeth," Olson said. "I've been living like this for the 
past week, and this has been one of the happiest experiences of my life."

CITY TO GAIN WIDER ROAD, CAR-POOLING

<P>
The city has been given permission to relocate 34 parking spaces in front of 
City Hall in exchange for starting a car-pooling program for city employees. 
</P>
<P>
The spaces will be shifted to nearby Villa Way and the employee parking lot 
behind City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The relocation is part of a road-widening project scheduled for this summer, 
during which another northbound lane will be added to Newport Boulevard from 
32nd Street to Via Lido and across the channel bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The new city program will allow employees to car-pool using city vehicles, 
Public Works Director Benjamin Nolan said. "We'll be ready to put (car-pooling) 
into place concurrently with construction of the Newport Boulevard project," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to reduce the city's parking needs by 12 spaces, Nolan 
said.

Originally, the city planned to move the parking places closer to City Hall to 
make way for the widening, which would have meant losing a slice of landscape 
in front of the building. However, some City Council members asked that another 
plan be created that would preserve the greenery. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission this week approved the relocation of the parking 
spaces and the retention of the landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Newport officials are also considering the possibility of building a parking 
structure to meet the city's long-term needs, Nolan said. Such a project could 
involve adding double-deck parking to the existing lot behind City Hall or a 
cooperative project with the Pavillions market next door, he said. LESLIE

SMOKING BANNED AT COAST COLLEGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Coast Community College District Board of Trustees has adopted a 
districtwide policy banning smoking in all facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking indoors had been allowed in designated areas on each of the district's 
campuses, which includes Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, Golden West 
College in Huntington Beach and Coastline Community College in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The ban also applies to KOCE-TV in Huntington Beach and the district office in 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Renley, vice chancellor of human resources and chairman of the 
District Wellness Committee, said information on the negative effects of 
smoking and secondary smoke persuaded the district to adopt a stricter policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The individual campuses had already adopted various policies that restricted 
smoking, and we wanted a stricter and more uniform policy that applied to all 
campuses and facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The district plans to assist employees and students who wish to stop smoking 
through programs offered at campus health centers.

AYERS DIES OF INJURIES FROM SUICIDE TRY

<P>
A Newport Beach woman who attempted suicide in her Santa Ana jail cell by 
hanging herself from a shower rod died Thursday night from related injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Pauline Ayers, 45, had been held since Aug. 12 in the women's jail as a 
suspect in the fatal shooting of prominent Los Angeles attorney Gerald 
Goldfarb, a 49-year-old appellate lawyer and columnist for the Whole Life 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies conducting a routine check Thursday discovered the woman hanging from 
a bedsheet tied to a shower rod. Ayers, a former interior decorator, was alone 
in her cell when the attempted suicide occurred, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. 
Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb died of multiple wounds to the head and body, and Ayers underwent 
surgery for a self-inflicted wound to the abdomen shortly after the shooting 
outside her Newport Beach condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Police alleged that Ayers fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun that she had 
bought just hours before the slaying. Investigators also allege that Goldfarb 
and Ayers had argued shortly before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers' attorney has said the woman mistook Goldfarb's friendship and legal 
counsel for a love relationship. Ayers' daughter, Christina Irwin, 27, said the 
two were romantically involved and were trying to have a child until Ayers 
suffered a mental breakdown early last year. WENDY PAULSON

UKRANIAN EGG ARTISTRY IS KEPT ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Zenovia Wrzesniewski was forced to leave the Ukraine during the Bolshevik 
revolution after her father was sent to Siberia, she left behind many things 
that were precious to her. 
</P>
<P>
But she was able to re-create at least one thing from her homeland. The 
ingredients were simple and she knew them by heart: a spout from an aluminum 
can, a stick, a piece of string, melted wax, dye -- and patience. 
</P>
<P>
From these items, Wrzesniewski fashioned a kistka, a tool used in pysanky -- 
the art of creating Ukrainian Easter eggs. Wrzesniewski, a Santa Ana resident, 
now uses her kistka to teach pysanky at workshops that she conducts throughout 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very unusual art form," she said. "Once you learn it, it is very 
tranquil." 
</P>
<P>
Pysanky is an ancient art which began as a pagan tradition of thanking the gods 
for the sun, Wrzesniewski said. When Christianity came to the Ukraine in AD 
988, the ritual was absorbed and the pysanka was likened to the tomb from which 
Christ arose. 
</P>
<P>
Though many pysanka designs are intricate and eggshells are fragile, 
Wrzesniewski said that anyone can learn the art form. 
</P>
<P>
She said her students have included everyone from children to people with 
physical handicaps. One of her proudest recruits was a 94-year-old women who 
was brought to class by her 76-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ingredients needed to decorate the eggs are simple, the process 
can be quite complex. A technique similar to batik is used in which hot wax is 
applied to the egg through a hollow brass cone with a pinhole opening at one 
end. Areas that are to remain white on the egg are covered with wax. 
</P>
<P>
The egg is then dipped in a series of dyes, with a wax coating added to 
preserve each successive color. 
</P>
<P>
Wrzesniewski said that her pysankas made from ostrich eggs have sold for up to 
$300. Chicken-egg versions sell for $12 to $20 each, she said. Faberge eggs, 
some of which are decorated with jewels, sell for much higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Wrzesniewski said her goal is to get people to both learn the art and 
understand its significance. In Orange County, she has teamed with La Palma 
resident Linda Mudlo so that they can increase the number of pysanky lectures, 
classes and shows offered in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Mudlo, who learned pysanky from her grandmother, said the art form is "a 
special link to your past." LYNDA NATALI

NEUGEBAUER TO RUN FOR WIEDER'S POST

<TEXT>
<P>
Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer will challenge Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder in her expected bid for a fourth term on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer, 62, a three-time former mayor, said she will take out nomination 
papers next week to run for Wieder's District 2 seat. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of paying a $752.96 candidate filing fee, Neugebauer is collecting the 
3,012 signatures needed to have her name placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We've collected signatures in each of the cities represented in the district 
to test my name recognition," Neugebauer said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities in the 2nd District include all of Cypress, Huntington Beach, Los 
Alamitos, Seal Beach and Stanton, and parts of Garden Grove, La Palma, Midway 
City and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer said she is not intimidated by the prospect of facing Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'll be elected on my strengths and not anybody else's weaknesses," 
Neugebauer said. "I have a longtime pattern of staying in touch with people, of 
listening to them and seeking their input on important issues." 
</P>
<P>
The councilwoman said her major concerns are transportation, crime, drugs and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
This is not Neugebauer's first run for higher office. In 1974, she ran 
unsuccessfully for the 38th Congressional District seat. She came in second in 
the Republican primary with 46% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a long-term interest in higher office," Neugebauer said. "Now that my 
children are grown, I want to work full time to make government responsive to 
the people it serves." 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer was elected to the first of five terms on the City Council in 1968. 
In 1984, she became the first mayor to be elected by popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, 69, of Huntington Beach, and Marie Alexis Antos, 45, a Seal Beach 
homemaker, will face Neugebauer in the June 5 primary election. GREG HERNANDEZ

MAN FATALLY SHOOTS EX-GIRLFRIEND, KILLS HIMSELF 
</P>

<P>
An Anaheim man shot and killed himself Thursday after he fatally wounded his 
25-year-old estranged girlfriend as she fled her Ontario apartment, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Terry Cornegay, 30, died instantly after he pointed a shotgun at himself 
and pulled the trigger, said Ontario Police Lt. Don Manning. 
</P>
<P>
An Ontario police officer fired three shots at Cornegay, but it is unknown, 
pending an autopsy, whether he was hit by the police bullets, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Manning said that Cornegay's former girlfriend, Brenda Lee Albright-Thurman, 
had frequently complained about Cornegay breaking into her apartment, smashing 
her car windshield and slashing its tires. 
</P>
<P>
Albright-Thurman had obtained a court order restraining Cornegay from 
approaching her or her West 4th Street residence, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kept calling and harassing her even after she got the restraining 
order," Manning said. "Our officers were called repeatedly." 
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Thursday, Cornegay entered Albright-Thurman's apartment through a 
broken window, police said. She ran outside as Cornegay began shooting and when 
officers arrived, they saw Cornegay firing at the woman, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"When he saw them he stopped, turned and put the gun up to his chin and shot 
himself," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Albright-Thurman died three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent ineffectiveness of restraining orders has long been a concern 
among police officers, domestic relations workers and legal advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the University of New Hampshire's Family Research Laboratory said 
that "easily obtained court protective orders, effective in most cases, are 
worthless against someone who is determined to hurt someone else."

QUADRUPLETS TO START COMING HOME IN SHIFTS

Al and Karen Miner thought they would have a couple of weeks to prepare a 
nursery after the birth of their quadruplets. As it turns out, they only have a 
matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, their babies will be going home from the hospital sooner than 
expected. The first will be home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing their hands will be full, literally, the Miners have been spending the 
last few days organizing their four-bedroom home in Orange for a house full of 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having the family come over to help us prepare," Al Miner said. "Knowing 
that time will be very precious for us, we're spending the next few days 
getting ourselves organized. We do have diapers. We're not totally organized 
with food yet, but we will be. We have to take inventory of what we do have and 
what we still need." 
</P>
<P>
The Miner quadruplets were born one week ago today, eight weeks early. To 
monitor the development of multiple premature babies, the hospital staff 
usually keeps the babies for a few weeks or even months, according to Dr. 
Manuel Porto, director of maternal-fetal medicine at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Because the quadruplets are progressing at different levels, each will be 
released at different times. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the babies -- Brianna, Whitney and Vincent -- were born healthy and 
bigger than most quadruplets, he said. One, Jeffrey, was born with a lung-fluid 
problem but is now in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
The quadruplets, all clad Friday in white beanies, booties, diapers and 
T-shirts embroidered with their names, were reunited on Valentine's Day when 
Jeffrey was released from intensive care to the intermediate nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I have gotten used to holding both of them in my arms, but it 
sure feels good," said Karen Miner as she rocked two of the children near her 
husband, who was holding the other two. After 59 days in the hospital, Karen 
Miner, 32, was discharged Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The infants were the first quadruplets born in Orange County, and the second 
such birth in California, through the fertility technique know as GIFT, gamete 
intra-Fallopian transfer. The method involves the woman's eggs being placed 
with the man's sperm in her Fallopian tube. Four eggs were used to increase the 
chances of pregnancy for the Miners. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said they were shocked when they were told last summer that they 
were going to become the parents of quadruplets. 
</P>
<P>
"I laughed," said Al Miner, a 34-year-old management consultant. "I don't know 
if the reality has struck me yet. Ask me in six months." 
</P>
<P>
"I was devastated and shocked," said Karen, a second-grade school teacher in 
Fullerton. "We wanted a child and we were blessed with four. We'll make the 
best of it." 
</P>
<P>
It is still hard to identify each infant, said Karen, but each is starting to 
develop his or her own characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard," she said. "But, I can tell Jeffrey because he has the blond hair 
and Brianna because she is the smallest."

WETLANDS BACKERS HOPE SPILL WILL RESULT IN ZONING

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Environmentalists said Friday they hope to ride a wave of publicity generated 
by the recent oil spill to achieve long-sought protective zoning for the 
coastal wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Feb. 7 oil spill, national news media have frequently referred to the 
endangered wetlands in Huntington Beach. That attention, the environmentalists 
said, will make it difficult for the City Council to turn its back on 
protective zoning for 225 acres of marshland between Beach Boulevard and the 
Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
While the oil spill danger was great, inaction by city government in protecting 
those wetlands is a more serious threat, the environmentalists said on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"A far greater danger . . . is the possibility of commercial or residential 
development" on those wetlands, said Chuck Gant, president of Friends of the 
Huntington Beach Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
Wetlands are marshy areas that serve as home for a wide range of rare plants, 
birds and small animals. Few wetlands remain in Southern California because of 
urban growth. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Smith, chairman of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, added: 
"Mother Nature is remarkably resilient, and the wetlands would eventually 
recover from the effects of an oil spill. But the destructive consequences of 
development on the wetlands are permanent." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council has scheduled a public hearing on the unzoned wetlands for its 
meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have been trying for the past 10 years to get the City 
Council to put a "conservation zoning" on the marshlands. That type of zoning 
would restrict commercial and residential development. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 225 acres in the marsh area have been cut off by Pacific Coast 
Highway from getting tidal water from the ocean. But almost all of the acreage 
can be restored to true wetlands conditions, as has 25 acres in the Talbert 
Channel area, environmentalists have said. 
</P>
<P>
Gant said he hoped the City Council may be swayed by a compromise the 
environmentalists reached with a special study group appointed last fall by the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
That compromise calls for giving one major landowner the option for limited oil 
exploration in the wetlands area on a one-acre site, Gant said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, heavy debate is expected at the Tuesday council meeting, according 
to other environmentalists. Some council members have said they believe that 
"conservation zoning" would constitute illegal seizure of the marshlands from 
its private owners. The city then might have to pay millions of dollars in 
compensation to the landowners, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Gant, however, said legal opinions given by two lawyers hired to study the 
matter have said the proposed zoning would not be a seizure of the lands.

WESTERN EMPIRE S&amp;L SEIZED; SUIT THREATENED

<P>
Federal regulators seized Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine on 
Friday, prompting angry threats from the New York investment group that bought 
the S&amp;L 13 months ago that it will sue the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators took over the thrift after deciding that it was operating in an 
unsafe and unsound manner and had inadequate capital with no prospects for 
obtaining more. They put the S&amp;L in receivership and transferred its assets 
to a newly created thrift called Western Empire Federal Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The new S&amp;L will open Monday for business as usual under control of the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that handles failed banks and 
thrifts. The S&amp;L has $491 million in assets and $312.4 million in 8,205 
deposit accounts, which will continue to be federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Harlan Inc., a New York investment group that paid $15.8 million in cash 
to purchase Western Empire in December, 1988, disputed the regulators' view of 
the S&amp;L's capital base and called the takeover "an unconscionable abuse of 
power that attacks the very foundations of our economic system." 
</P>
<P>
The New York investors charged in a prepared statement that regulators "have 
confiscated our investment, which they urged us to make, without due process." 
The group called it "expropriation, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
Castle Harlan said it plans to sue the government for breach of contract and 
unconstitutional seizure of its property. Rob Wages, an executive with the 
group, said legal action is one of several options that the investors are 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire is the second Orange County thrift that regulators have seized 
this month. A week earlier, they seized Huntington Savings &amp; Loan in 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Without government assistance or guarantees, Castle Harlan purchased the 
insolvent Western Empire, and came up with a rescue plan that was approved by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
That plan relied on securities trading, including a concentration of high-risk, 
high-yield corporate securities known as junk bonds. At the end of September, 
Western Empire had $191.8 million, or 33.8% of its $567.8 million in assets, in 
junk bonds. In addition, it had about $220 million in mortgage-backed 
securities, usually considered a much less risky investment. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress changed the rules in August when it passed comprehensive 
legislation to bail out the ailing S&amp;L deposit insurance fund. The law 
requires thrifts to sell their junk bond portfolios within five years, a 
last-minute provision that started the huge slide in the value of junk bonds. 
Thrifts nationwide held about 10% of all junk bonds in December. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market continued to take a beating as even healthy S&amp;Ls wrote 
down the value of their junk bonds to reflect falling market prices. Western 
Empire attributed its $2-million, third-quarter loss to junk bond losses. It 
lost $3 million during the first nine months of 1989.. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond tumble eventually led to the collapse earlier this week of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert, the New York investment banking firm that pioneered the 
market.

QUEEN OF KINK NOT TAKING IT LYING DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
EROTICA: 'POST-PORN MODERNIST' ANNIE SPRINKLE, WHO HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY AN 
ORANGE COUNTY CONGRESSMAN FOR RECEIVING FEDERAL ARTS FUNDING, SAYS SHE IS THE 
TARGET OF A CENSORSHIP EFFORT.

<P>
Annie Sprinkle has come to terms with the unpleasant reality. With a hint of a 
grin, the "post-porn" performance artist and former queen of kink concedes that 
she needs Rep. Dana R. Rohrabacher just as much as he needs her. 
</P>
<P>
"I like exploring forbidden places," Sprinkle, 35, explains in her 
sometimes-dreamy, sometimes-deliberate voice. "I like breaking taboos, pushing 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't have the other people on the other side, making the taboos and 
setting the limits, I wouldn't have anything to explore." 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Rohrabacher, who represents northwestern Orange County, has 
never met Sprinkle, a former prostitute and the star of more than 100 hard-core 
pornographic films. But he's been thinking about her a lot lately. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican congressman has leveled his guns at an 80-minute, one-woman show 
that Sprinkle performed last month at the Kitchen, one of New York's best-known 
showcases of avant-garde performance art. Rohrabacher's complaint is that, as 
he understands it, "Annie Sprinkle: Post Porn Modernist" was staged with the 
assistance of the United States government. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the following performance sound like an appropriate use of tax dollars to 
you?" Rohrabacher asked last week in a "Dear Colleague" letter circulated to 
all 435 members of the House of Representatives. The letter, which has become a 
hot item around Washington, went on to list various acts reportedly performed 
by Sprinkle with an assortment of inanimate objects and gynecological 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the Sprinkle shows ever actually received any of the taxpayers' money 
is a matter of some debate: Government officials in New York say they 
"purposefully did not fund" them because, artistically, the shows were found 
wanting. Still, the controversy has become the latest touchstone in 
Rohrabacher's campaign to prevent the National Endowment for the Arts, which 
Congress funds, from supporting indecent or obscene artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Rohrabacher tried unsuccessfully to eliminate government funding for 
the arts, citing the Libertarian argument that art ought to be free of 
government interference. He later returned to the issue when he aligned himself 
with conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in an attempt to ban NEA 
sponsorship of "offensive" artwork. 
</P>
<P>
The latest flap pits Rohrabacher against Sprinkle, the NEA, the New York State 
Council on the Arts, and The Kitchen Center for Video, Music, Dance, 
Performance and Film in lower Manhattan. While Sprinkle's artistic credentials 
may be open to dispute, those of the Kitchen apparently are not. The New York 
State Council on the Arts has helped support the Kitchen for nearly 20 years. 
Among the theater's other patrons are the American Express Philanthropic 
Program, the AT&amp;T Foundation, IBM, Chase Manhattan, CitiBank, the Morgan 
Guaranty Trust Co. of New York and the New York Times Foundation. Its board of 
directors includes Laurie Anderson, a performance artist, and Philip Glass, a 
composer and musician, both of whom have performed there. The New York Times 
has referred to the Kitchen as "New York's pioneering and premiere space for 
the avant-garde performing arts." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a fly-by-night organization," said Tim Mulligan, a spokesman for the 
New York arts council. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of both the embattled NEA and the New York State Council on the Arts 
insist that they did not specifically approve financing for Sprinkle's 
performances and that their money did not support her shows. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, however, contends that the NEA underwrote the Sprinkle shows at 
the Kitchen in two ways: indirectly, through a $60,000 grant to help pay the 
Kitchen's operating expenses, and through a $25,000 grant from the New York 
arts council for a series of shows this year. The New York arts council 
receives $500,000 from the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
"The (state) arts council receives funds from the NEA, but those funds are used 
for administrative salaries, and not granted to the Kitchen," said Barbara 
Tsumagari, the theater's executive director. Furthermore, Tsumagari said, the 
arts council did not use any state funds to support Sprinkle's shows. 
</P>
<P>
The Kitchen originally applied for a state arts grant for 36 shows in its 
performance art series, including four shows by Sprinkle. The state arts 
council approved a $25,000 grant for 32 shows, but did not specifically list 
the shows that were to be funded. 
</P>
<P>
"The council purposefully did not fund the full series because it believed that 
the Annie Sprinkle presentation was not of an artistic quality to warrant 
council support," the council said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
As for the $60,000 operating grant from the NEA, Tsumagari said, "because the 
endowment gives (operating) money does not mean the endowment is literally 
funding every single activity of an institution." Tsumagari said Rohrabacher is 
attempting to hold the national endowment responsible for the actions of the 
institutions that receive its support. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a very dangerous argument," she said. "I think his use of this 
incident is reckless because (what he says) is not factually accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher dismissed that explanation. "It's clear from everything they've 
said that they did not prohibit the use of any of their funds for Miss 
Sprinkle's performance," Rohrabacher said. "They felt that denying funds to an 
act that was as sexually graphic and even pornographic as the one Miss Sprinkle 
was engaging in . . . would be an act of censorship. . . . These people are 
living in the Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Sprinkle chooses not to discuss the specifics of the financial 
dispute. But she will tell you, "My (tax) money goes to a lot of things I don't 
like. I'm paying for nuclear bombs. I'm paying for wars. . . . My tax dollars 
are going for art that I think is really stupid and boring and trivial." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Sprinkle says, "in a sense, I feel I am government-sponsored in 
general. I pay taxes, I'm a taxpayer, I walk on city streets, they give me 
water, they have police to protect me. So they're sponsoring me to do whatever 
it is that I do." 
</P>
<P>
Annie Sprinkle is anything but reticent about discussing her views of art, 
pornography, censorship, the federal government, Rohrabacher and sexuality, not 
necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle, born Ellen Steinberg in the San Fernando Valley, looks more like a 
New Age Goldie Hawn than a pornographer. Her dark hair is barely tamed. She 
favors tie-dyed tights under short, black skirts. And she can screw up her face 
into a self-consciously innocent grin that would put Fanny Brice to shame. 
</P>
<P>
She loves diamonds. But not the usual variety. She wears a real one in an upper 
incisor and shows off a black, diamond-shaped tattoo that circles her right 
ring-finger. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my diamond ring," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in a modest, midtown Manhattan apartment that houses an extensive 
library of literature on Tantric and Taoist sexual practices, whimsical 
pornographic photos, an energy altar of incense and candles, and a pair of 
black spike-heeled boots that hang on a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are bed boots," she says. "You can't stand up in them." 
</P>
<P>
Another wall is filled with Polaroid photographs of men and women in various 
stages of undress and display. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my friend Les, the transsexual," Sprinkle explains. "He was a woman 
who became a man. Here I made him up as a woman. This is me dressed up like a 
guy. This is my Tantric sex teacher. This is my mother. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle is serious about her work and what she says is the threat of 
censorship. But she bounces her way through the thickets of philosophical 
debate with the off-kilter finesse of a Gracie Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider myself a sex researcher," she says. "I study my own sexuality, I 
study other people's sexuality. . . . I read a lot of books. I do it every 
which-way. . . . That's what I do in life. That's my job. And that has taken me 
into all kinds of areas, including pornography and prostitution. And now art." 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle describes her move out of pornography and into performance art and the 
higher realms of sexuality as a journey that has delivered her from the "junk 
sex" that is the staple of most Americans' diets. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of mainstream porn, I find it boring and dull, and I'm over it," she 
says. In its place, Sprinkle says she is exploring the outer reaches of 
sexuality in an eclectic approach that combines Eastern philosophy, meditative 
breathing, spirituality and healing. 
</P>
<P>
"Sex is not really about genitals, it's more about energy. You can learn to 
build energy, share it with a partner, send it out to the universe, channel it 
for healing, or whatever. You can have an orgasm just from breathing." 
</P>
<P>
In an article on feminist pornographers that appears in the most recent issue 
of Mother Jones, Sprinkle is quoted as saying, "I want to be the Shirley 
MacLaine of porno." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Rohrabacher's graphic description of her performance, Sprinkle says her 
show was not intended to arouse. 
</P>
<P>
The show was "not about being erotic," she says. "My work is about 
deconstructing mainstream images of what is sexy." 
</P>
<P>
In one segment, for example, she projects on one side of the stage erotic 
photographs that she has taken in her apartment/studio. On the other side are 
photographs of the models as they arrived for the photo session, in street 
clothes and without makeup. The piece is called, "The Transformation Salon." 
</P>
<P>
"It totally smashes their image of what a model is," she says. At the end of 
the piece, Sprinkle tells the audience: "Maybe there's a little porn star in 
some of you, and maybe not. But I can tell you from a lot of experience that 
there's a lot of you in every porn star." 
</P>
<P>
In "Bosom Ballet," Sprinkle cups, twists and nearly ties a knot with her ample 
breasts. Writing in Mother Jones, Laura Fraser observed that the piece works at 
"exaggerating people's big interest in big breasts." 
</P>
<P>
In another piece, Sprinkle performs oral sex on inanimate objects. However, she 
says the piece, which features a background tape of men's voices making 
suggestive remarks, is intended to deal with the subject of sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I cry, I scream, I spit. It's very visceral," Sprinkle says. "But the 
congressman, he saw it as just sucking on sex toys. . . . It was a prop to 
express pain and agony and sadness and grief. If you take it out of context, it 
may sound like a 42nd-Street (pornographic) show, but it was so far from that." 
</P>
<P>
But is it art? 
</P>
<P>
An earlier version of the show received a favorable review in Art Forum, a 
national art magazine. "Sprinkle went beyond nakedness, revealing so much of 
herself that it transcended eroticism to become something even more primal," 
reviewer C. Carr wrote. Sprinkle also has been interviewed by Drama Review, 
another highbrow publication. 
</P>
<P>
"Annie has been looked at by the serious art community," the Kitchen's 
Tsumagari explained. "(Her) program I think is a serious work that deals with 
very serious issues. It is well within the tradition of experiment that the 
Kitchen has pursued for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the theater said, "The performances of Annie Sprinkle 
were an important and timely contribution to an on-going examination of gender 
issues as they relate to the mass media . . . (including) the nature of 
pornography and the treatment of women." 
</P>
<P>
Even Rohrabacher said he is unwilling to say that Sprinkle is not an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't make that judgment. Let's let the people decide for themselves what's 
art and what isn't. If people want to spend their money to see Annie Sprinkle, 
they have every right to do so, and she has every right to present herself to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I'm complaining about is when, directly, or indirectly, they're 
putting tax dollars into her garter belt."

'OH! CALCUTTA!' TO UNVEIL AT CELEBRITY THEATRE ON 'FAREWELL TOUR'; 
</P>
<P>
MUSICAL: A BUS-AND-TRUCK VERSION OF THE NAUGHTY REVUE WILL PAUSE FOR TWO 
PERFORMANCES SUNDAY IN ANAHEIM AS IT TOURS AMERICA.

Let the record show that 20 years, eight months, three weeks and a day after 
"Oh! Calcutta!" first opened off-Broadway, a bus-and-truck version will bow 
here Sunday for two performances at the Celebrity Theatre in what is being 
billed as "a farewell tour." 
</P>
<P>
Let the record also show that this naughty musical revue is coming to bid adieu 
by way of one-nighters in Orono, Me.; Stamford, Conn.; Middletown, N.Y.; 
Burlington, Vt.; Greensboro, N.C.; Pensacola, Fla.; El Paso, and other 
similarly theater-starved towns. 
</P>
<P>
By now the legend of "Oh! Calcutta!" has grown ripe with age. On a lark, 
British drama critic Kenneth Tynan invited a handful of friends -- including 
such cultural luminaries as Jules Feiffer and the two Sams (Beckett and 
Shepard) along with John Lennon -- to dash off a dozen or so sketches about 
"the pursuit of happiness through sex." 
</P>
<P>
The result -- which opened June 17, 1969, and seemed an outgrowth of changing 
sexual mores -- was a trendy mishmash of dirty jokes, erotic ballet, soft rock, 
disco lighting and, above all, fleeting moments of frontal nudity. Naturally 
the show became a megahit roundly panned by the critics. Some even joked that 
the sketches were individually uncredited in the program because the writing 
was so bad the famous authors didn't want the credit. 
</P>
<P>
In its first yearlong run on Broadway ending in 1972 and in a revival there 
from 1976 to 1989, "Oh! Calcutta!" gave a total of 5,959 performances -- thus 
becoming the second longest-running show in Broadway history (topped only by "A 
Chorus Line"). Not to get too sentimental, Tynan's mischievous experiment is 
reported to have grossed about $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
This time out, with a non-Equity cast assembled in New York for the 90-city 
tour, the big stop will be a week in Detroit. That will come in March, with the 
tour scheduled to end in May. If, however, box office receipts in the 
hinterlands are good enough, an "Oh! Calcutta!" spokesman said producers are 
considering a goodby wave to Europe, where previous versions have toured. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the material is the same as before," said Cheryl Hartley, who spent 11 
years in the Broadway revival and is staging the musical numbers for this 
production. "They built a new set. They have the costumes we used. There are a 
lot of costumes." 
</P>
<P>
Although the show "has a reputation for nudity," she said from Boca Raton, 
Fla., "the nudity is not that big a deal. The language is really much more 
shocking. It's a lot of little dirty jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"On Broadway we had so many foreign tourists seeing the show, they didn't get 
the jokes because they didn't understand English. On this tour the people are 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
During a 1979 tour of "Oh! Calcutta!" lawyers for the show had to go to court 
in 24 of 119 U.S. cities to make sure performances could begin. In three other 
cities, police arrested the cast for obscenity after the curtain went up. 
</P>
<P>
Allen Stewart, a spokesman for producer Barry Singer, said from his New Jersey 
office that this tour has not encountered any problems with would-be censors. A 
newspaper in Oklahoma City declined to run an advertisement, he said, and a 
radio station in Stamford yanked a commercial after callers complained. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the people who haven't seen the show that rant and rave," Stewart said. 
"They think it's the worst thing to come to their town. But if they've seen it, 
it's not that bad." 
</P>
<P>
Just so you know: The musical revue has nothing to do with India or anything 
remotely Asiatic. The title is a pun on a slangy French phrase expressing 
admiration for the female sexual organ. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh! Calcutta!" will be staged Sunday at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. at the Celebrity 
Theatre, 201 E. Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $17 (matinee), $19 (evening). Box 
office: (714) 999-9536.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If all goes according to plan, the Huntington Beach Art Center -- scheduled to 
open in spring 1991 -- is likely to become Orange County's most adventurous 
community art center. It has savvy leadership, wide-ranging and innovative 
program plans, and support from both the redevelopment-minded city and the 
recently formed nonprofit Huntington Beach Art Center Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The center will occupy an 11,000-square-foot former Southern California Edison 
building purchased by the city for $758,000 in 1988. The site is centrally 
located (at 538 Main St., five blocks from the ocean) and architecturally 
friendly to the range of sizes and media that characterize contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
The $750,000 renovation scheme by Thirtieth Street Architects of Huntington 
Beach approved by the City Council earlier this month will turn 4,500 square 
feet in the heart of the building into three galleries. They'll have 16-foot 
exposed wood ceilings, concrete floors and moveable walls to be reconfigured 
with each show. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Irvine Fine Arts Center was conceived primarily as a place for 
community members to take studio art classes, and no galleries were included in 
the original plan. Galleries at the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton 
were awkwardly carved out of rooms in a former home. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Huntington Beach center's galleries will show six exhibitions 
annually of work by artists with national and regional reputations. All kinds 
of art will be included in these shows: painting, sculpture, crafts, 
interdisciplinary work, book art, site-specific installations -- you name it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the exhibits will be organized by director Naida Osline and her staff 
in cooperation with independent curators or other cultural institutions. Some 
exhibits may be rented from such well-regarded organizations as the American 
Federation of the Arts and Independent Curators Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Shows at the center will "aim to place artwork into a cultural and 
art-historical context," Osline says, by means of free handouts, wall labels, 
videos and other informational aids. "We're not just packaging work that's 
already been done," she adds. "We're interested in developing new work." 
</P>
<P>
The third gallery will annually showcase about eight to 10 one-person exhibits 
by local and regional artists as well as broad-based community shows (for 
example, an exhibit based on querying local residents about the objects they 
consider beautiful). 
</P>
<P>
Other forms of art -- independent films, classic movies and art videos -- will 
be shown in the 1,000-square-foot multipurpose room. Its raised platform also 
will accommodate lectures and panel discussions (by artists, curators, art 
historians and critics), performance art, readings by regional poets and 
storytelling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The building will be the site of training programs -- for elementary and high 
school teachers interested in introducing art to their students -- and intern 
programs for college art students. 
</P>
<P>
Ideas include involvement in an "international exchange" that would bring 
teen-agers or senior citizens from different countries together and send art 
supplies or basic necessities to needy artists in other countries. Osline also 
talks about encouraging discussion and action by local artists regarding such 
political issues as freedom of expression and tax laws that affect the 
production of art and contributions to art institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The center's 650 square feet of studio space will be used for classes, 
workshops and demonstrations in both "conceptual and technical art-making 
skills," Osline says. The rest of the building will house a bookstore, 
administrative space, a kitchen (to serve receptions and parties) and areas for 
art preparation, shipping and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the center's big wish list needs money to fuel it. That's where the 
foundation -- formed as a fund-raising body -- comes in. It is raising money 
for the renovation as well as for a $3-million endowment expected to furnish an 
annual operating budget of $200,000 to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Headed by Robert B. Goodrich, the 10-member foundation board received its first 
contribution of $75,000 from FHP Health Care last week. GTE also recently 
agreed to underwrite an annual fund-raising equestrian event at the Huntington 
Beach Equestrian Center. Meanwhile, at the community level, the foundation is 
selling bricks for $100 apiece that will be engraved with the donor's name and 
displayed on a wall inside the entryway. The money will be used specifically 
for programming. 
</P>
<P>
The city will cover all operating costs for the first two years, before the 
endowment is expected to accrue enough funds. Subsequently, the city will 
continue to supply utilities and pay the salaries of the center's employees -- 
manager Michael Mudd, Osline and support staff -- who are part of the cultural 
affairs division of the Community Services Department. Other income will come 
from user fees: an admission or suggested donation (still undetermined) and 
fees for lectures and classes. 
</P>
<P>
Two aspects of the center's plans stand out as particularly laudable. One is 
its well-thought-out balance of programming -- both for the community at large 
and sophisticated art viewers who may travel from outside Orange County to see 
intriguing, cutting-edge work. The other is the way the center fits into the 
redevelopment scheme for the rundown downtown area while retaining -- in its 
freewheeling spirit and encouragement of noncommercial, non-mainstream art -- 
aspects of the scrappy, scruffy "edge" that characterized the city in simpler 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The center will be part of Celebration Plaza, a $560,000 city project designed 
by Cardoza-DiLallo-Harrington. It is supposed to transform the area bounded by 
Main Street, 6th Street and Pecan Avenue with new landscaping and "hardscaping" 
</P>
<P>
that will provide an outdoor venue for public art, performances and 
celebrations of one sort or another, for which Main Street can be closed to 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
In developer-speak, Celebration Plaza is considered the "inland anchor" of the 
336-acre Main-Pier area, the largest redevelopment area in the city. This 
summer, more more than 1,000 new condo units and townhouses are due to be 
completed, as well as several hotels, restaurants, a health center and a 
shopping mall. And in 1992, the city plans to reopen the old pier, damaged in a 
1988 storm, after a much-ballyhooed $10-million reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Even without all this activity, about 12 million bodies already descend on the 
beaches every summer. So the center is about as far on the beaten path as it 
can be. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than seeking to cater specifically to the tastes of the surfers or 
tourists looking for McDonald's or yuppies scouting upscale boutiques, Osline 
simply views the center as "an alternative space in Orange County." The point 
is to be inclusive rather than specialized or snooty, she says. She talks about 
planning exhibits dealing with social issues like the recent oil spill, AIDS or 
the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Involvement with the real world and the challenging side of the art world make 
all the difference between a timid, provincial art center and one that seeks to 
broaden a community's horizons and bring it closer to the heart of the 
unpredictable, often scruffy and perverse heart of the "art experience." Time 
will tell whether this will happen in Surf City, U.S.A., but the signs look 
very promising. See you July 1 at the ground-breaking.

Saving the world! 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a job for Superman, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this particular job would be better handled by millions of 
mild-mannered homeowners willing to make a few changes in the way they live by 
making their homes environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to start thinking about how to use less energy per person," says Bill 
Roley, an environmental science instructor at Saddleback College and the 
executive director of the Permaculture Institute of Southern California, an 
organization that provides public education on ways to live without polluting. 
</P>
<P>
"Home energy consumption is a significant portion of the pollution in general. 
Insulating your home is addressing the greenhouse crisis because you are going 
to use less fossil fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"We could probably reduce the 6.5 tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
every year just by using a house that's been insulated wisely." 
</P>
<P>
Roley is the designer of Sprout Acres, a model environmentally friendly home in 
the Bluebird Canyon area of Laguna Beach that shows how people can live in a 
way that promotes conservation of natural resources and encourages recycling. 
</P>
<P>
This "house of the future" -- as Roley calls it -- includes systems for solar 
heating and cooling, year-round organic food production, a solar greenhouse and 
earthworm fertilizer farming. The four components of human living -- water, 
food, energy and waste -- are part of a cohesive system designed to lessen the 
demand on the utility, water and sewer companies and also on the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"You link everything together so that one waste is another resource for 
something else," Roley says. At Sprout Acres, for instance, household waste is 
composted to nourish the gardens, filtered water from the shower and kitchen 
sink is recycled into the garden, and air rising from the attached greenhouse 
heats the main house. 
</P>
<P>
Eco-Home in Los Angeles is another such demonstration project. It features 
energy and water conservation systems such as solar-powered lights, 
solar-heated water, low-flow shower heads and toilets, wall and attic 
insulation, and weatherstripping around doors and windows. Organic gardens, 
drip irrigation and trees are part of the environmental-preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
"An environmentally friendly home is one that allows us to maintain our life 
style without damaging the environment," says Julia Russell, founder of the 
Eco-Home Network, a nonprofit organization dedicated to demonstrating physical 
systems for the home that are not detrimental to the surroundings. The 
organization is based in Los Angeles and counts 900 members worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take living in a model home to save significant amounts of energy, 
though. Roley says there are several simple energy conservation steps that any 
urban homeowner can take: Weatherstrip doors and windows, add attic insulation, 
use trees to shade the house in the summer, illuminate individual work areas 
instead of an entire room, use energy-efficient appliances and fluorescent 
light bulbs, hang curtains to keep heat inside during the winter and outside 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
And there's another payoff: Sprout Acres has the lowest utility bills of any 
house in its neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Conserving energy is only one facet of living in an environmentally friendly 
manner. Reducing the use of toxic materials can make your home more compatible 
with Mother Nature. The first step is to stop buying them every week. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to shop ecologically. Smart shopping habits can reduce the production 
of carbon dioxide and CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) in the atmosphere," Roley 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Stores such as the Natural Grocer in Laguna Niguel and Mother's Market in Costa 
Mesa carry products that are environmentally safe. At these you'll find 
nontoxic, biodegradable household items such as fabric softeners, glass 
cleaners, laundry detergents, cleansers and floor polishes. All are made 
without perfumes, dyes, phosphates or chlorine. 
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Generation mail-order catalogue offers hard-to-find items such as 
unbleached toilet paper and coffee filters, cellulose sandwich bags and paper 
products made from recycled paper. To request a copy, call (800) 456-1177. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that there are simple alternatives to toxic products. The Alameda 
County Office of Education publishes a comprehensive booklet called "Our Common 
Future: Healing the Planet -- A Resource Guide to Individual Action." Among the 
information on alternatives to toxic household products and shopping with an 
environmental awareness are several suggestions for making substitutions: a 
dish of hot vinegar can be used as an air freshener; a mixture of lemon juice 
and olive oil can polish furniture or floors; and baking soda dissolved in 
water can clean ovens. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is also important. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure to reduce trash production is reaching critical mass. According to 
a state survey, Southern California generated 67.1% of California's waste in 
1988. The state Waste Management Board estimates that if trash continues to be 
created at its current rate, Southern California will run out of landfill 
capacity in four years. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing the amount of trash your household contributes to the waste stream can 
have a significant impact on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
According to a compilation of government statistics by Janet Marinelli of 
Garbage magazine, an estimated 30% by weight and 50% by volume of household 
garbage is disposable packaging material used to hold and wrap the items we 
buy. The process starts at the grocery store: If you don't bring it into your 
home, you won't need to discard or recycle it. 
</P>
<P>
Buy products sold in bulk and with the least amount of packaging. Buy meat, 
poultry and fish at the butcher counter instead of in prewrapped packages. 
Avoid items covered in many layers of packaging, particularly those that are 
wrapped in more than one type of material. Don't purchase one-time items such 
as disposable razors or cameras. Select items that are repairable, refillable 
and reusable. Stay away from disposable paper products as much as possible. Use 
mugs instead of paper cups, cloth instead of paper napkins, dish towels instead 
of paper towels. 
</P>
<P>
Buy items that are recycled or that come in containers that can be recycled. 
The three most easily recycled materials are glass, aluminum and newsprint. 
</P>
<P>
The act of recycling has many ramifications. Not only does it reduce the trash 
sent to landfills, it also conserves natural resources and reduces energy use. 
</P>
<P>
It can, for example, slow the depletion of tropical rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"The bauxite mining that takes place in the tropical regions of South America 
is the direct result of our consumption of aluminum cans," says Jennifer Rigby, 
curator of education at the Santa Ana Zoo. "If people can recycle more aluminum 
cans, it may reduce the need for the mining of bauxite." 
</P>
<P>
On Earth Day, April 22, the Santa Ana Zoo will be presenting a program between 
11 a.m. and 2 p.m. to show how individuals can make their homes more 
environmentally friendly. It will include information and demonstrations on 
recycling, resources for finding alternatives to toxic household cleaning 
products, guidelines for making environmentally sound choices at the 
supermarket. There will also be exhibits on endangered wildlife species and 
their disappearing habitats. 
</P>
<P>
Rigby, who created the zoo Earth Day program, says she is keeping the scope 
simple, hoping to get people interested. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately," Rigby says, "what we want to show people is that they're capable 
of making (conservation-minded) decisions. There are alternatives. The point is 
not to despair. Take a small step. If everyone takes one small step, we will 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Sprout Acres is open for tours once a month. The February tour will begin at 
noon Feb. 24. Directions and further information is available at (714) 494-5843 
. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-hour tour of the Eco-Home in Los Angeles will be led Tuesday and Sunday 
at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Call (213) 662-5207 for reservations. A donation of 
$5 is requested.

BEDROOMS HAVE BECOME LAVISH ISLANDS IN SWIFT STREAM OF LIFE

Judy Deaton has never forgotten the sage words of her former interior design 
instructor: "When you go to visit a client's house, always ask to see the 
bedroom. That will show his true personality." 
</P>
<P>
Rooms that will be seen by neighbors and friends may be decorated to impress 
other people, he said, but one decorates a bedroom only to please oneself. 
</P>
<P>
"The bedroom says more about a person than anything else," says Deaton, now an 
interior designer with the Interior Designers Institute in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Bechtold, owner of The Bedspread Story in Anaheim, which offers custom 
bedspreads and all the trimmings, has theorized about who is attracted to 
different styles of beds. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who choose contemporary tend to be more on the outgoing, younger side," 
Bechtold says. "They're more daring." 
</P>
<P>
Clients who want the "country, cutesy stuff," meanwhile, tend to be more 
conservative and introverted, she says. They're often homebodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Victorian-style bedspreads usually appeal to an old-fashioned person. I made 
one for a woman was very quiet, very soft-spoken. The bedspread she wanted was 
a frilly satin chiffon. It fit." 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Bechtold has been surprised by couples who appear conservative, 
yet pick the wildest bedspread. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't show that private side," she says. 
</P>
<P>
As the focal point of the room, beds can uncover a lot about their owners' 
personalities, moods and hidden desires. 
</P>
<P>
Deaton thinks it is no accident that today's beds have become increasingly 
lavish -- with elegant bed linens, frothy pillows, coordinating dust ruffles, 
upholstered headboards, canopies and tents. 
</P>
<P>
"With the mood of our generation, there's more emphasis on the bed," she says. 
"I was talking with my designer friends about how everyone is more into 
themselves, and there's a big promotion of intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
It is as if people have decided, "Nothing's too good for myself, and therefore, 
my bed." 
</P>
<P>
Bedding stores offer ample opportunity for self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
At Sheridan in South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, shoppers have their choice of 
fantasies. They can find coordinating sheets, pillowcases, comforters, dust 
ruffles and throw pillows to match any mood. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling regal? One can outfit a wooden canopy bed in an Old World-style 
comforter with a navy paisley print, gold and navy foulard sheets and 
coordinating striped pillows in navy, gold and cranberry. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling primitive? There's a tropical comforter and coordinating sheets with 
palm leaves, parrots and cockatoos in bright greens, reds and yellows, 
reminiscent of a Gauguin painting. 
</P>
<P>
Styles vary dramatically, from a slate blue, pink and cream floral print that 
is awash in ruffles to a simple black-and-white geometric print with hot pink 
accent pillows. 
</P>
<P>
"People can express themselves with their bedding without worrying about what 
others think," says Elaine Hankin, an interior designer in Huntington Beach. 
"They can reveal their hidden desires for wonderful fabrics and textures. In 
public spaces, they tend to be more conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Hankin has found her male clients generally favor geometric patterns and strong 
colors, avoiding pastel florals. 
</P>
<P>
"They really like the black, white and red geometrics," she says. "They want to 
be certain there's nothing frilly about their beds. They want something totally 
different from what mom had." Freud might have called it bedspread envy. 
</P>
<P>
Women, however, often indulge in frilly, lacy spreads and pillows -- the kind 
of bedding that makes them feel pampered. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Hankin has clients who break the stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had men want a princess bed. They have fantasies," she says. "I had a 
very strait-laced client who asked for an antique sleigh bed, the kind with the 
headboard that curved outward, and magnificent, sensuous silks. I thought, 
'Wow, there's some fire burning in there somewhere.' " 
</P>
<P>
An older couple surprised her by requesting linens in black lace and silk. 
</P>
<P>
"I was amazed. These were not young people, but they really wanted something 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
When two people share a bed, their distinctive personalities can lead to a 
battle over bedding. 
</P>
<P>
"With young married couples, there's always a conflict," says Walter Nutting, a 
Costa Mesa interior designer. "We get these guys who have to move out of their 
bachelor pads into Laura Ashley bedrooms. I stand back and let them work it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Nutting also has been surprised by his clients' choice of bedding. "I've run 
into very masculine men who have very frilly beds. I don't know what that 
says." 
</P>
<P>
For some discriminating sleepers, even the standard rectangular mattress won't 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Bedding, a manufacturer of custom mattresses in Costa Mesa, has handled 
orders for beds shaped into hearts and horseshoes, or perfect squares and 
circles. Some customers want bigger than king-sized beds. 
</P>
<P>
"They just like all that romping room," says store owner Tom Sceberras. 
</P>
<P>
People have come to treat their bedrooms as a refuge from the outside world. 
Instead of venturing out into traffic jams, they stay at home and watch a movie 
on the VCR. Many have moved entire entertainment units into their bedrooms, 
turning the room into a separate apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, "the bed itself has become more important," Deaton says. "It's 
larger in scale and more dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
People are investing in heavier headboards, from gleaming silver-plated rods to 
stripped logs. "In the mid-'80s, beds were lighter. We used a lot of plain 
Scandinavian platforms," Deaton says. "Today we have upholstered headboards, 
more canopies and heavier wood." 
</P>
<P>
Even the placement of the bed in the room has changed to reflect its greater 
status. No longer is it automatically shoved against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the bed is often set in the center of the room like a big, oversized 
couch," Nutting says. "We never used to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Interior designers say their clients want to lavish money and attention on 
their beds because they are spending more time in their bedrooms. "Most people 
have such stressful work lives," Deaton says, "that they have a need for a 
place that's quiet and intimate."

UPDATING THE MAINSTREAM SHOWER

<P>
The demand for luxury bathtubs hasn't cooled consumer interest in showers, 
designers say. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, with bathtubs taking up more space in master baths, showers 
increasingly are becoming separate units with their own array of luxury items. 
</P>
<P>
In interior designer Karen Myers Ziccardi's Newport Beach home, for example, an 
8-by-6-foot marble shower is tucked into a corner across the room from her 
large whirlpool tub. It has a skylight, a wide bench on two sides, a steam 
shower unit, a body-spray fixture and his-and-her shower heads. ("Two working 
people get a chance to visit a little," she says.) 
</P>
<P>
Hans Rindfleisch, owner of Eurobath and Tile in Costa Mesa, says Rainbars, 
which sell for about $360, are much in demand, especially among athletes. The 
two-foot-long bar provides a full-body spray. "You're totally immersed in 
water," he says. "It's like a carwash." 
</P>
<P>
He says there are hundreds of different shower heads ranging from $250 to 
$1,000 -- many with massage units. Thermostatic valves, for $250, keep the 
temperature and water pressure constant when water is being used in other parts 
of the house. Steam-shower devices with timers are available for up to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the popularity of oversize bathtubs, designers say showers are 
still used far more frequently than tubs. 
</P>
<P>
Some have even made entertainment centers of their showers. One of 
Rindfleisch's customers has a built-in TV that sits at eye level behind a 
shield of glass. SHERRY ANGEL

AFFLUENT DRAWN TO BIG, BRAZEN BATHTUBS IN ALL COLORS, SHAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Myth No. 1: Real men don't take showers. 
</P>
<P>
Myth No. 2: Real women are small enough to submerge all their parts in a 
standard-size bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
Bathtub manufacturers have finally figured it out: People want bathtubs big 
enough for at least one adult -- preferably two. Including men. And they want 
their baths to be as soothing as a massage or an afternoon nap. 
</P>
<P>
So manufacturers are building bigger and better bathtubs that include whirlpool 
systems and come in a wide variety of colors, shapes and sizes. And Orange 
County's affluent homeowners are making them the centerpieces of master 
bathrooms that are as big as many bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"People have discovered the bathroom as an erotic area where you can become 
human again after the stress of the day," says Hans Rindfleisch, owner of 
Eurobath and Tile in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic magazine recognized the trend in a recent article in which Philip 
Langdon observed: "By the early 1980s the plumbing manufacturers, aiming at an 
increasingly leisure-oriented public, had succeeded in associating the bathroom 
with sensual pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Before oversize tubs became widely available, designers began meeting the 
demand for bigger bathing areas by building Roman tubs -- made entirely of 
ceramic tiles. They were beautiful -- and big -- but hard to keep warm and 
acutely uncomfortable, Rindfleisch says. 
</P>
<P>
"The era of the ceramic tile tub has finally ended," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, luxury bathtubs hit the market after the sexual revolution, but 
they arrived in plenty of time to capitalize on the fitness craze. 
</P>
<P>
In many households with whirlpools, the bathtub is just a few steps away from 
the home gym, and the master bathroom includes a sauna or steam shower as well 
as a tub, says Karen Myers Ziccardi, owner of Interior Design Development Inc. 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
She says luxury tubs are also part of the cocooning trend: "People are using 
their own homes as an alternative to a mini-vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Rindfleisch has seen the demand for luxury bathroom products grow as the 
county's real estate market has softened. When people were able to turn a quick 
profit on a home, "they didn't want to spend any money," he says. "People have 
become very quality oriented because they're staying longer in their homes." 
</P>
<P>
There has even been a demand for the ultimate whirlpool tub -- American 
Standard's two-person "Sensorium and Ambiance," which has such sophisticated 
electronic gadgetry that you can talk to it by phone. By dialing home and 
entering a code, you can program it to be filled at the desired temperature by 
the time you get there. 
</P>
<P>
The Sensorium also has a stereo system and a one-way video camera so you can 
see who's at the front door if guests arrive while you're bathing. You can even 
unlock the door -- and control lights in the bathroom and other parts of the 
house -- without leaving the tub. 
</P>
<P>
The price: $28,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Gardner, marketing manager of New Jersey-based American Standard, said 
sales have been small but steady, even though the Sensorium was created as a 
marketing tool -- "to demonstrate the full-bore capability if we applied all 
the bells and whistles available in the market." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't identify any Orange County customers, but many of those "bells and 
whistles" have become de rigueur in the county's luxury master bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is inundated with tub manufacturers. The range of colors and 
configurations is enormous," says Mike Perry, vice president of Penn Pipe, a 
distributor in Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
The variety of choices on the market is evident in Eurobath and Tile's 
showroom, where customers are encouraged to sit or lie in whatever tubs strike 
their fancy. 
</P>
<P>
Each has different contours, including curves and seats to provide back 
support, so finding the right fit is as important as color and design, 
Rindfleisch says. 
</P>
<P>
The tubs in his showroom -- which range from $1,100 to $3,000 -- are round, 
oval, rectangular and square. (A 7-by-4-foot oval is the most popular, 
Rindfleisch says.) 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't want room for two -- the average oversize tub takes 70 
gallons of water to fill -- a deeper-than-usual standard-size whirlpool tub is 
available for $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
Extras for luxury tubs include head rests, which can be placed at both ends; 
grip bars for safety, and waterfall spouts, which fill the tub faster than 
regular fixtures -- and really sound like waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers can decide how many whirlpool jets they want and where to place them, 
and the jets can be adjusted to make water pressure soft, medium or hard. 
</P>

Rindfleisch says the traditional cast-iron tub has given way to acrylic, 
fiberglass and excyte, a crushed marble that has a solid feeling but looks like 
porcelain. 
</P>
<P>
Tubs come in such bold colors as black, pink, maroon and blue -- with matching 
sinks -- and are usually surrounded by a tiled ledge for towels, plants or 
decorative objects -- or placed in a large tiled platform with steps leading up 
to the tub. Popular accents include hand-painted tiles, elegant fixtures, 
mirrors, and even fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Rindfleisch, who has designed bathrooms that cost as much as $50,000 with all 
the finishing touches, says his customers want their tubs next to a window with 
a view whenever possible -- as long as privacy is assured. And more customers 
are asking for designs incorporating stereos and televisions because, he says, 
for many people, "the bathroom has become an entertainment center." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, practical considerations are behind the move to bigger 
baths. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Schreiber, whose master bathroom was designed by Rindfleisch, says she 
wanted a large tub "because of my husband's size." And Ron Schreiber, who is 6 
feet, 3 inches tall, said the custom-built Mission Viejo home they moved into 
about two months ago needed a large master bath -- and tub -- to match the 
scale of the rest of the house. 
</P>
<P>
They chose a 7-by-4-foot pink oval whirlpool tub set in green Italian Grazia 
ceramic tile that resembles marble but has more luster. The spacious shower 
next to the tub is made of the same tiles and has two shower heads -- one at 
Ron's height, the other positioned lower for Becky, who is 5 feet, 3 inches 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
The Schreibers, who have a home gym and use the whirlpool at the end of their 
workouts, also placed a fireplace in front of their tub, which, Ron says, adds 
a romantic touch to their master bath. 
</P>
<P>
A fireplace also graces the master bath in Karen Myers Ziccardi's custom-built 
Newport Beach home. Her 4-by-6-foot, rectangular, ivory-colored whirlpool tub 
is set in a platform of Botticino Fiorito Aegean marble, which is also used in 
the two-person shower across the room. The brass fixtures in her tub include a 
waterfall spout and a hand-held shower. 
</P>
<P>
Ziccardi says a luxury bathroom is a strong selling point in the resale market. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an illusion of romance. People think of cozy evenings together in the 
tub with bubble bath and champagne. These things make people excited about 
making a change." 
</P>
<P>
Working couples with children may find they don't have the time to use an 
oversize tub as often as they expected, she notes, "but knowing it's here makes 
it real special when you take the time." 
</P>
<P>
Large bathtubs are so much in demand that even builders of the more expensive 
tract homes are putting luxury into master baths -- including unusual-shaped 
tubs with whirlpools, she says. "The standard, typical bathtub is no longer 
acceptable in the master bath." 
</P>
<P>
Rindfleisch says some of his customers are shy about asking for luxury items 
such as a tub big enough for two. During consultations, he looks for the 
"hidden meanings" behind what they say they want. And in his drawings, he tries 
to capture their fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to identify with their dreams," he says. 
</P>
<P>
That's what he did when he designed his own bathroom in his Laguna Beach home. 
He has a large, round whirlpool tub-shower unit enclosed in frameless glass -- 
a cocoon in which he mentally prepares for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a bath every morning. I lie there and let my mind wander and relax and 
have my nerves stretched before I come to work," he says. 
</P>
<P>
One of Ziccardi's customers who has a whirlpool tub does the same every night. 
"This is her luxury after a hard day," Ziccardi says. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a luxury that designers say is unlikely to go out of style in a county 
with so much affluence and so many health-conscious people living at a dizzying 
pace -- except when they're on the freeway.
