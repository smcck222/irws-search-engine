The U. S. government plans to start building a controversial ditch at the 
border near San Diego within 60 days, U. S. immigration Commissioner Alan C. 
Nelson disclosed Friday, insisting that Mexico should not consider the action 
"a hostile act." 
</P>
<P>
But the Mexican consul general in Los Angeles, Romeo Flores Caballero, 
interrupted Nelson as he was announcing his plans to reporters and told him 
pointedly: "You should be building bridges, not ditches." Nelson smiled and 
said hello. 
</P>
<P>
Later, speaking to reporters, Flores compared the ditch to the Berlin Wall and 
called the U. S. government's action "narrow-minded." He added, "It is not 
really promoting better relations between the two countries." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson's statement Friday was the most definitive by any top-ranking U. S. 
official that the government has firmly decided to move ahead with the project 
despite the backlash it has stirred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surprise to San Diegans 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, however, where the ditch is to be built, the revelation that its 
construction was imminent came as a surprise, both to local officials and to 
officers of the U. S. Border Patrol. Area lawmakers have not been extensively 
notified about the progress of the project, even though it is to be built on 
land owned in part by the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not aware of any existing agreement between the city of San Diego and the 
INS," said Deputy City Atty. Ted Bromfield. "If city land is involved, it would 
require the consent and cooperation of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Manager Severo Esquivel cast doubt on a 60-day timetable for 
beginning construction, saying that winning approval from the city manager's 
office and the San Diego City Council for use of the land would take "certainly 
months, possibly years." 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't heard anything about it," added Doug Byrns, an aide to Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor. "We're surprised, obviously surprised." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who represents the 
border area, said he had heard nothing about construction beginning within two 
months. The supervisor was contemplating requesting that the federal government 
hold a public hearing on the project, the spokesman said. It was unclear 
whether such a hearing is required in the case of the ditch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governors' Conference 
</P>
<P>
Nelson and Flores were attending sessions of the annual conference of border 
state governors from the United States and Mexico. Gov. George Deukmejian was a 
co-chairman of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The governors went on record as recommending that the U. S. and Mexican 
governments: 
</P>
<P>
* Try to substantially reduce Mexico's $105-billion foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
* Urge that public and private entities try to modernize outmoded highways, 
rail lines and telephones in Northern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
* Support expansion of maquiladora industries that use plants on both sides of 
the border to take advantage of cheap Mexican labor. 
</P>
<P>
* Modernize border stations to end logjams. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the governors sidestepped the issue of the ditch -- la zanja -- 
although Texas Gov. William P. Clements, joining Flores, called for "building 
bridges, not ditches." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has repeatedly been pestered by Mexican reporters about the ditch 
during his five-day trip. He has pleaded little knowledge of the project. At a 
press conference of the governors Friday, Deukmejian cautioned, "It is 
premature to conclude what the final decision (on construction) will be." 
</P>
<P>
On one point Wednesday, however, he asserted, "It's important all countries 
have the opportunity to control their own borders." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, was eager 
Friday to explain the U. S. government's side of the project to reporters and 
government officials, especially those from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$2-Million Cost 
</P>
<P>
The ditch, which Nelson estimated will cost $2 million, is planned for the flat 
Otay Mesa between canyons on the west and foothills to the east. It would be 
roughly 4 miles long, 5 feet deep and 14 feet wide at the top, sloping at a 
45-degree angle to 6 feet at the bottom. Nelson said plans call for the ditch 
to be built only with dirt, although some officials have suggested it be 
reinforced with concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a plain old vanilla ditch," Nelson insisted. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, officials said the project is still on track. "An environmental 
impact study is taking place," said Duke Austin, spokesman for the INS, "and we 
expect that to be completed by April. That will determine how quickly we 
proceed." 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department official said the ditch will be constructed by a labor 
force contracted by the International Boundary and Water Commission, a 
committee of U. S. and Mexican officials. The commission has been involved in 
the planning of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government will finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
The ditch's purpose, Nelson and other U. S. government officials have 
maintained, is twofold: first, to divert runoff water that has been flowing 
into Mexico and, second, to block the hundreds of vehicles that each month 
carry drugs and other smuggled contraband into California. 
</P>
<P>
Many thousands of immigrants also illegally cross the border there on foot, but 
U. S. officials say the ditch is not aimed at stopping them. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government has protested the ditch through its foreign ministry, 
and the proposal has been denounced in Mexico's congress. Flores charged that 
the concept of diverting water "was contaminated politically." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, although disputing accusations that Mexico was not consulted about the 
project, nevertheless said: 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously don't ask Mexico's permission to build a ditch on our side to 
stop vehicles. . . . It's on the U. S. side -- obviously, we have the right to 
do things, just as they do on their side." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmental Report 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said his "best estimate" is that the ditch digging can begin within 60 
days and be completed by the end of summer. "Now, the only issue is the 
environmental review. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The project was approved by Atty. Gen. Richard L. Thornburgh last month and 
money is available, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
But "nothing's definite in the world," Nelson added, conceding that the project 
could still be derailed by opposition. "But, as far as we're concerned, the 
idea is reasonable. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"On the open tableland of the Otay Mesa you have serious problems with 
drive-throughs. There are injuries, deaths, smuggling of aliens, drugs that we 
feel could be stopped by this very simple ditch, along with the (water) 
drainage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reason at all that the Mexican government or people or press ought 
to look at this as a hostile act. I mean, the Mexicans didn't like the (1986) 
U. S. immigration law. They said, 'Gee, how can you have employer sanctions?' " 
</P>
<P>
He added that there already are man-made barriers along the border, including 
fences, culverts and canals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Sensitive Issues' 
</P>
<P>
But Flores wasn't buying any of it. "These are sensitive issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said he could "not conceive of the country that is fighting to destroy 
the walls of the world building one exactly to stop the flow of people from 
other parts of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
"We're fighting all over for freedom," he continued, "and we have made a big 
issue out of the wall in Berlin. And now you want to build a wall like that." 
</P>
<P>
U. S. Ambassador Charles Pilliod, in an address to the governors, defended what 
he called "the much-maligned ditch." 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly contradicting the immigration service commissioner, Pilliod said: 
"This project has just two purposes, one is drainage and the other is public 
safety. No one in the U. S. government believes the ditch will have any 
significant impact on the overall number of illegal entries into the United 
States. And, with regard to drug traffic, it is essentially irrelevant."

The sight of the iguana is not uncommon in Los Angeles, a census of the 
Department of Animal Regulation indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The spiny-backed lizard made famous by such writers as Tennessee Williams and 
James M. Cain is the most popular exotic critter in the city. There are 511 
residents who hold iguana permits. 
</P>
<P>
Monkeys are next on the list of documented animals with 43, followed by such 
unusual house pets as tarantulas (14), scorpions (11), llamas (9), boa 
constrictors (8), raccoons (4), alligators (2), deer (male) (1), tigers (1) and 
African lions (1). The iguana, which is common to Mexico, is apparently a 
favorite of the heavy Latin population here. Meyer Levine of Animal Regulation 
theorized that while some permit-holders might station the animals in their 
yard as watch-lizards, others could be trying to raise little iguanas "because 
they are considered a delicacy." 
</P>
<P>
Although it's not reflected in the city figures, the exotic animal population 
has decreased with the recent move of singer Michael Jackson's menagerie to his 
new ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson has one-year permits to keep a llama, a chimp and a deer at his 
one-acre estate in Encino, having previously disposed of a baby giraffe and a 
boa constrictor. "We had an inspector out there the other day and all the 
animals were gone," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's chimp, Bubbles, may well prefer the seclusion of the Santa Ynez 
Valley since the humiliation of last year when the animal was denied entry with 
Jackson into Great Britain because of quarantine laws. 
</P>
<P>
There's an Ortega in Central America who doesn't like Ronald Reagan. However, 
an Ortega on Central Avenue in Duarte feels differently. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ortega, the principal of Northview Middle School, wants to rename his 
school after Reagan, no matter what Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega might 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"This has nothing to do with politics," Northview's Ortega said. "I just think 
it would be very good publicity for us to have one of the first schools in the 
country named after Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega plans to poll local school officials as well as Northview's students. 
</P>
<P>
"The poll of the students will be structured," he said, explaining that merely 
asking the students who they'd like to name the school for would likely result 
in a rock group being honored. 
</P>
<P>
"You might wind up with AC/DC Middle School," Ortega noted. 
</P>
<P>
Pershing Square was called Central Park back then. On Feb. 21, 1889, the City 
Council established the first Los Angeles Department of Parks. 
</P>
<P>
To mark the anniversary Tuesday, the city Recreation and Parks Department is 
throwing a noontime party in the plaza near Olvera Street, featuring ethnic 
dance groups as well as a presentation by Mayor Tom Bradley of memorabilia to 
be placed in a time capsule. 
</P>
<P>
The capsule, which will be buried in the plaza, will contain such items as two 
feathers from the endangered California condors at the Los Angeles Zoo, a 
bottled grunion from Cabrillo Marine Museum and a letter from Bradley to 
whoever is mayor of Los Angeles in the year 2089, assuming it's someone 
different.

After considering rock singer Prince and a Fundamentalists Anonymous leader, 
editors of the satirical humor magazine, The Wittenburg Door, have chosen 
Jessica Hahn as their "theologian of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Editors at the evangelical-oriented magazine, based in El Cajon, said with 
tongue in cheek that "candidates" included Prince, whose "LoveSexy" album they 
termed "a hedonistic collection of theological gibberish," and Richard Yao, a 
founder of Fundamentalists Anonymous whom they regarded as an 
evangelist-in-reverse during a published interview in the same issue of the 
bimonthly. 
</P>
<P>
But Hahn, who lived last year at the Playboy Mansion and made a topless and a 
later nude appearance in Playboy magazine following the 1987 revelations of her 
sexual encounter with then-PTL evangelist Jim Bakker, won the hearts of Senior 
Editor Mike Yaconelli and his colleagues at The Door. 
</P>
<P>
"In the September, 1988, issue of Playboy, Jessica was able to crystallize 
theologically the relationship between faith and nudity, sex and heaven, 
Pleasing God and Pleasing Myself, and much, much more," they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The editors quoted Hahn's advice published in Playboy to those who have hurt: 
"I spoke with God and asked for a miracle. The next day Playboy called. That 
was my miracle. Don't give up hope."

DARK THOUGHTS HAUNT CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS REUNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THEODORE C. SORENSEN, Theodore C. Sorensen, who served as special counsel to 
President John F. Kennedy, now practices law in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most extraordinary aspect of last month's Moscow conference on the Cuban 
missile crisis was the fact that it took place at all. 
</P>
<P>
No one could have imagined in October, 1962, when Robert McNamara, McGeorge 
Bundy and I were conferring in the Cabinet Room with President John F. Kennedy 
and a dozen others on the world's first potentially nuclear confrontation, that 
one day we would gather in Moscow with Soviet and Cuban counterparts for a 
frank and friendly exchange of facts and views about the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 18, 1962, as he met tensely in the Oval Office with Soviet Foreign 
Minister Andrei Gromyko and Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, the President could 
not have imagined that one day these men and their colleagues would be sitting 
around a Moscow table amiably answering our questions on the crisis, exchanging 
acknowledgements of error with us and openly disagreeing among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Among American scholars and experts, the 1962 confrontation over missiles in 
Cuba is almost everyone's favorite crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hawks like to talk about Kennedy's naval blockade, facing down Nikita S. 
Khrushchev and forcing his missiles out of our hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Doves like to talk about Kennedy's cool diplomacy, peacefully resolving the 
crisis without the United States firing a single shot. 
</P>
<P>
Revisionist historians like to complain that Kennedy needlessly brought the 
world to the brink of nuclear destruction over a Soviet action that, however 
hostile and surreptitious, did not fundamentally threaten our security. 
</P>
<P>
Right-wing scholars like to complain that Kennedy's refusal that October to 
launch an invasion of the communist satellite 90 miles from our shore cost the 
United States its last best opportunity and excuse to go in there and take Cuba 
away from Castro. 
</P>
<P>
War-games theorists are divided into those admiring the carefully executed 
management of the crisis by Kennedy and his advisers and those castigating the 
mistaken assumptions and miscalculations on both sides that nearly led the 
world to a nuclear nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
As the discussion in Moscow confirmed, there is some truth -- but only some -- 
in each of these perspectives. Ultimate release of the transcript of our 
proceedings will no doubt provide new ammunition for each of these analysts, 
justifying new editions of their books, new essays and new lectures on their 
favorite crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1962 showdown over Cuba was my least favorite crisis. I hope never to 
see its like again. Our discussions in Moscow refocused my mind not on the 
successful, statesman-like resolution of that conflict, which filled me with 
overwhelming pride and relief at the time, but on the terrible vulnerability 
and fallibility of man in the nuclear age. 
</P>
<P>
We talked earnestly in Moscow about the invaluable role of continuing 
communication between the combatants during a nuclear crisis. I agree that this 
was one of the most important lessons of 1962. But it is now clear that some of 
those communications included deception, exaggeration and bluff, which could 
have led to unthinkably disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
We talked proudly in Moscow about our respective commanders-in-chief, 
exercising careful control of the situation to avoid plunging headlong into the 
irrevocable and unknown. Kennedy and Khrushchev do indeed deserve praise for 
their ultimate caution and their rejection of less temperate advice. But it is 
now clear that no military machine can be wholly free from dangerous human and 
mechanical errors beyond the control of the most prudent commander-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
We talked matter-of-factly in Moscow about the calculations and the numbers 
that weighed heavily in the balance of choices during those 13 unprecedented 
days and nights in 1962 -- the number of missiles on each side, the number of 
nuclear warheads in place, the number of air sorties required for a "surgical 
strike" at the missile sites, the number of troops on both sides, the number of 
casualties expected, even the numerical odds of war. 
</P>
<P>
But it is now clear that no one in the room in January, 1989, or in October, 
1962, could quantify an acceptable level of nuclear destruction or an 
acceptable risk of nuclear war. It is thus not surprising that the meeting in 
Moscow has refueled old controversies -- within, more than between, the two 
superpower delegations -- over how great the risks really were as the crisis 
neared its climax on the night of Oct. 27, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, we will never know with any certainty -- no matter how many 
conferences we hold or how many pieces of evidence we selectively recall -- 
whether Kennedy would have in fact launched an invasion of Cuba had the Soviet 
rockets not been removed promptly, or whether Khrushchev in response would have 
launched an attack on Berlin or Turkey. We will never know whether the American 
forces storming Cuba would have used the tactical nuclear weapons recommended 
by the Pentagon. We will never know whether the Soviets, either before or after 
such an attack, would have fired their Cuban-based missiles at American cities 
rather than have them captured or destroyed by American forces. On these 
questions, we simply do not know what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God.

TAKING ON THE NRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bill introduced in the U.S. Senate would ban the importation and sale of 
semi-automatic weapons, like the AK-47, and set up tough screening procedures 
to try to keep anyone with a criminal record from legally buying such guns. Los 
Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates is one of those who supports the measure. 
What are the chances thatit will pass Congress and make it to the statute 
books? If history is any guide, and if the coercive influence of the National 
Rifle Assn. is no less today than it was last year, the chances are slight. But 
maybe, just maybe, in the aftermath of the murders by AK-47 of five children in 
a Stockton schoolyard a month ago history is about to change, and the NRA is 
about to lose one. 
</P>
<P>
That's a big maybe, but a few things have happened since last month's tragedy 
to give some hope that more elected officials now sense that the public 
interest and the interests of the anti-gun-control lobby diverge very 
considerably on this issue, and that for a change the public interest had 
better prevail. Thus after the Stockton bloodbath a number of California 
communities, Los Angeles among them, adopted ordinances barring the sale of 
semi-automatic weapons like the AK-47, the AR-15, the Uzi and the MAC-10. 
Pending before the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors is a proposal to ban such 
sales in unincorporated county areas. A similar ban has been introduced in the 
California Legislature and has won support from top law-enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
A tougher law on semi-automatic rifles has two things going for it: First, it's 
hard to argue that citizens worried about becoming victims of crime need 
rapid-fire weapons to defend themselves, their homes or their businesses. 
Second, increasing numbers of these weapons are passing into the hands of youth 
gangs and drug dealers, raising the possibility, as Gates told senators, that 
the police could soon find themselves outgunned. 
</P>
<P>
To be effective, though, the controls on semiautomatic rifles would have to be 
applied on a national scale. The fact that the AK-47 that was used by Patrick 
Purdy to kill five and wound 30 on Jan. 17 was bought legally and openly in 
Oregon and simply carried across the border into California shows that local 
option is largely irrelevant. State and municipal bans are certainly important 
as expressions of public concern, but it's clearer now than ever that only a 
federal law has any chance of controlling the dangerous spread of 
semi-automatic weapons. At least it's clearer to most people. President Bush, a 
lifetime member of the NRA, says that he still opposes federal controls on 
semi-automatic weapons. The problem, he claims in what has become the NRA's 
mantra, is with criminals, not guns. But of course if it were made more 
difficult for criminals and psychopaths to get hold of certain kinds of guns, 
the problem would diminish. 
</P>
<P>
The law as it currently stands is simply absurd. A purchaser need only fill out 
a form denying that he's a convicted felon, an illegal alien or someone with a 
medical history of mental instability. No background check is made on would-be 
purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure before the Senate, sponsored by Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), 
would apply to the sale of semi-automatic weapons the same regulations that now 
govern the sale of machine guns: Shoppers would be subjected to background 
checks to identify those who had criminal arrests or convictions, and 
law-enforcement authorities would have to certify that the weapons were being 
purchased for licit purposes. All this should at least work to restrict the 
number of semi-automatic weapons that can be legally obtained, even though it 
would do next to nothing to reduce the supply of such weapons -- estimated at 
up to 500,000 -- that are already in private hands. But at least the regulation 
and the ban on future imports of semi-automatic rifles would begin to impose 
some measure of sanity on what has become a demonstrable and growing threat to 
public safety.

SELL JORDAN DOWNS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In theory the proposal to sell the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts to 
private developers sounds good. Developers would buy the deteriorating public 
housing in exchange for lucrative tax credits. The housing authority would get 
millions for a new rent-subsidy program for poor people. But in practice the 
rundown apartments would be a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
How many developers would be ready to pay $10 million to $20 million for 
decrepit public housing in hard-core gang territory, then maintain it for 
low-income tenants? Even if a buyer stepped up, would the tenants be well 
served by a private owner? 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Downs was built 34 years ago, when public housing was a 
government-financed dream come true for poor families -- a way out of crowded, 
unhealthy slums. Unlike the monstrous concrete high-rises built in other large 
cities, Jordan Downs spread two-story townhouse apartments over 50 acres of 
land, with plenty of room for playgrounds. For years it provided safe and 
pleasant shelter for thousands of families. 
</P>
<P>
Currently home to 3,150 people, most of them children living with their 
mothers, Jordan Downs needs more than a face lift. A new owner would have to 
spend up to $14 million on major repairs, air conditioning and laundry rooms -- 
none of which now exist. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Downs is so plagued by crime that homeless families have rejected offers 
of apartments -- preferring to double up with friends, stay in temporary 
shelters or live in cars. A private owner would have to install a security 
system and find a way to weed out tenants who are criminals or who harbor 
criminals. That would not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Public housing is often the housing of last resort. Rents are pegged at 30% of 
income including welfare, with an average of about $200 in Jordan Downs. Even 
at those rents, a fraction of market value, many tenants are several months 
behind. Although the government would continue to subsidize rents, a new owner 
would have to find a way to force out seriously delinquent tenants. What, then, 
would happen to evicted tenants who would be hard to place elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
The notion of selling Jordan Downs arose as part of a study by housing 
officials concerning how to rehabilitate the deteriorating townhouses. The Los 
Angeles Housing Authority doesn't have the money to make the repairs. The 
federal government would be unlikely to be newly generous, although the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development would have to approve any deal. 
</P>
<P>
A private deal, although not a perfect solution, would allow new owners to 
repair the project, improve security and winnow out troublesome tenants. It 
would work best with cooperation from tenants who were allowed to help shape 
the renovation plans and become a strong part of the new management team. The 
bigger their stake, the better the chance of an attractive and well-run housing 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Downs may be in bad shape, but housing authorities cannot give up. The 
shortage of housing for poor families is critical and getting worse in Los 
Angeles. Getting an agreement with a private developer is worth a try.

GANGS AND SCHOOL LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your concern for the educational and social environment of Edwin Markham 
Intermediate School is exemplary. Your previous article on the "Super Kids of 
Watts," (the Markham Pentathletes) was well-received by the student body, 
faculty, staff and region administrators. However, your article on Feb. 5 
("Gang Tension: At School, Survival Comes First," Part I) did just the 
opposite. 
</P>
<P>
Your staff could have taken a more positive approach in recognizing the 
majority of the student body at Markham instead of the minority you seemed to 
relish, dwelling on gang tension. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reinforcing feared beliefs of inner-city students, you could have 
mentioned the two track stars in the '88 Olympics, Kevin Young and Florence 
Griffith Joyner, who were former Markham students. You could have mentioned 
alumni from Markham that are doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, teachers, and 
administrators. You could have mentioned the 88 students in 1987 and the 60 
students in 1988 who participated in the Run for Fun city competition. We also 
have students who participate in the Jesse Owens track meets. We send students 
yearly to regional algebra and geometry competition. Our students take the PSAT 
and participate in the Saturday Med-Core Program. We have other students who 
participate in drama, dance, and Shakespearean festivals. 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher, alumnus, and parent, I, too, am concerned about Markham and the 
long-neglected students who are neither "gangbangers" or pentathletes. They are 
the students who walk to and from school with no problems because they don't 
hang out with gang members. They are the students who regularly attend class, 
and learn in the process. They are the 57% who graduate from Markham, graduate 
from high school and for some, attend at least one year of college. They are 
the students whom corporate America should invest in because they possess a 
strong sense of character to survive no matter what the situation.

ISRAEL AND HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial reveals some important truths. When will Israeli leaders ever 
realize that violence is getting them nowhere? When will they ever stop looking 
on Palestinians as second-class citizens? 
</P>
<P>
Violence on both sides must stop. It can only lead to more serious 
brutalization. Many American Jews disagree with the policies and practices of 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government. They feel that Israeli troops are 
overreacting to the Palestinian threat. 
</P>
<P>
This is a complex problem; it won't admit to a simplistic answer. It requires 
the efforts of world leaders. They must impress upon Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders the absolute necessity of diplomacy. Otherwise, if we don't establish 
some kind of peace soon, we may find this strife leading us to a terrifying 
configuration.

The spirit of fairness that your editorial demonstrates is an inspiration and 
hope to millions of Jews, Christians, Muslims and others representing 
mainstream America. Our tears should not discriminate, and when out of the 
victims of the Holocaust emerge the aggressors and the perpetrators of yet 
another holocaust we should stand for justice. 
</P>
<P>
The burning question is perhaps America -- rather than Israel -- and human 
rights, for it is America's military aid and the billions of U.S. money that 
fueled the Israeli government's actions. America can -- in various ways -- tip 
the balance in favor of human rights and a just peace.

I was very disappointed at the way my school was described. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, not all of us are gangbangers or wantabes. I am a B-plus student 
with all intentions of being a successful gynecologist one day. Most of my 
friends here also have ambitions to have a successful future. We compete 
academically, we challenge our teachers, we thrive on learning new and 
different things and we even have fun! We respect our teachers, administrators, 
and every adult who is here for us. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Pasternak inflated the negatives about Markham and the few students who 
say that they are gang members. Very little was said of the many magnet 
students who come here by choice and who are bused in from as far as 
Westchester and Carson. Nothing was said about the long waiting list of 
students wanting to get into the Health Careers Magnet Program. Nothing was 
said about many of our parents who have college degrees or who are working 
everyday to make things comfortable for us, instead of our being on welfare.

ISRAEL AND HUMAN-RIGHTS VIOLATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
With regard to your editorial, the chapter on Israel in the U.S. State 
Department report on the status of the human rights situation around the world 
was prepared with Israel's full cooperation. However, the report examines the 
acts of an administration, not the circumstances of the events. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Six-Day War of 1967, a war that was fought for its very survival, 
Israel is the authority responsible for security and stability in Judea-Samaria 
and the Gaza District, and for the welfare of the residents there, Jew and 
Arab. In the last 21 years, Israel has exerted efforts in numerous areas to 
improve the living standards of the local Arab inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbances since December, 1987, have posed serious problems and 
challenges for Israel, which is duty-bound to take all necessary measures to 
restore calm and stability. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has not been facing peaceful demonstrations of law-abiding citizens. 
Israel has been facing violence, frequently incited by extremist elements, and 
that violence has assumed a number of forms: riots, terrorist attacks, and 
assaults against the life or property of Jews and Arabs by local radical 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
The disturbances in Judea-Samaria and the Gaza District have witnessed massive 
stonings of persons and moving vehicles, attacks with slings, iron bars, 
chains, knives, and home-fashioned lethal weapons of all types. Increasingly, 
Molotov cocktails have been used. Such violence is meant to kill. 
</P>
<P>
Those residents of the territories who are suspected of having committed 
security offenses are dealt with in full accordance with international law and 
the humanitarian provisions of the Geneva Conventions. 
</P>
<P>
Within the context of tremendous human-rights abuse throughout the world and in 
particular in the Arab world, the special focus on Israel takes the issue 
entirely out of perspective. Instead of devoting public scrutiny to regimes 
that use every means at their disposal to silence and crush all potential and 
actual dissent, Israel is made the main focus of attention. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, the real answer to this complex and serious situation in 
the territories lies only with a negotiated settlement -- peaceful solutions 
understanding and cooperation. It's high time that the Palestinians realize 
that violence will get them nowhere and that they must put a stop to the force 
and violence.

BANE GIVEN $18,000 BY 2 FIRMS FAVORED IN FAILED BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER and MARK GLADSTONE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after accepting $18,000 in campaign contributions from two financial 
institutions early last year, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) introduced 
legislation that opponents said would have aided the two firms in a pending 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, introduced by Bane in February, 1988, prohibited litigants in 
civil lawsuits from obtaining confidential information from the state 
Department of Savings and Loans through a subpoena. The bill, supported by the 
California League of Savings Institutions, passed the Assembly with no 
opposition last year but died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
An Assembly consultant and the bill's opponents say the measure could have been 
retroactive, thereby affecting the pending lawsuit. The defendants in the case 
were financial institutions seeking to prevent documents obtained from the 
savings and loans department with a subpoena from being introduced as evidence 
against them. Both were major contributors to Bane. 
</P>
<P>
Bane did not return phone calls Friday. The Daily News of Los Angeles reported 
that he said he did nothing improper, quoting Bane as saying he intended to 
prevent disclosure of all confidential savings and loans department records 
without a court order, including those involved in the pending legal case. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, chairman of the influential Rules Committee and a champion of the savings 
and loan industry, reportedly said: "I would have introduced the bills if there 
were no contributions. Anything wrongly obtained should be returned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clarify Existing Law 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Savings and Loans said the measure would merely clarify 
existing law, said Kenneth Cooley, chief counsel for the Assembly Finance and 
Insurance Committee, which unanimously sent the bill to the Assembly with 
little discussion. He said such a clarification could have been considered 
retroactive, although Assembly committee members were not informed that it 
might apply to an ongoing lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The retroactive provision of the bill could have affected pending litigation 
involving American Savings &amp; Loan of Stockton, which was then financially 
ailing and has since been divided into two financial institutions, and Gramercy 
Mortgage, a Burlingame-based affiliate of Homestead Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies were named in a December, 1982, lawsuit filed by Dividend 
Development Corp. of Santa Clara. Dividend alleges that American and Gramercy 
improperly foreclosed on two large real estate projects in the Bay Area and is 
seeking $40 million in damages. The suit accuses Homestead of fraudulent 
misrepresentation and concealment, breach of contract and unfair business 
practices. Homestead filed a countersuit against Dividend; the litigation is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Dividend Development used a subpoena in 1985 to obtain confidential state 
Department of Savings and Loans documents about the foreclosure that "severely 
impeach Homestead's defenses and claims in the litigation," said Peter Fortune, 
Dividend's attorney. Homestead claimed the documents were released illegally 
and had sought unsuccessfully in court to suppress the materials. 
</P>
<P>
Bane received a $6,000 campaign contribution from Gramercy on Jan. 11 and 
another $6,000 Feb. 1. On Jan. 25, he received a $6,000 contribution from 
American Savings &amp; Loan. He had also received $5,000 from each firm in 
early 1987. The contributions coincide with Bane's Valentine's Day dinner, his 
major annual fund-raiser. He introduced the savings and loan bill Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
After the bill passed the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee in June, 
Dividend hired lobbyist Herb Nobriga, a former consultant to the Assembly 
Judiciary Committee, to oppose it. Nobriga said he informed banking committee 
Chairwoman Rose Ann Vuich that the measure could affect the pending Dividend 
lawsuit. Vuich then retrieved the bill for a second look by her committee in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legislation Failed 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to pass out legislation that affects a court case," she said 
Friday. She added that it died when Bane failed to ask for it to be heard 
again. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it illegal to accept contributions in return for a specific 
action, such as sponsoring or supporting a bill. Bane has maintained that the 
savings and loan industry backs him because he supports their role in financing 
home construction and creating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Bane ran a national savings and loan association for a decade. He received a 
total of $102,480 in campaign contributions from savings and loans in 1987-88, 
nearly 10% of the $1.1 million he raised, according to campaign reports.

BURBANK SCHOOLS MAY ENROLL BIG MAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of "Mac Tonight," Burbank students could soon be singing "Big Mac on 
Campus." 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Board of Education is considering a plan to allow fast-food 
franchises such as McDonald's or Jack-In-The-Box to open outlets on high school 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Some school officials have expressed concern about security on the campuses at 
the district's two high schools, Burbank and Burroughs, because students are 
allowed to come and go during the lunch period and other breaks. 
</P>
<P>
If fast-food outlets were on the campuses, school officials said, it would be 
easier to confine students to the grounds and close the schools to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
The officials speculated that the availability of fast-food off campus and 
dissatisfaction with food on campus cause students to leave. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's TV advertising features a "Mac Tonight" jingle, using the tune of 
the classic song "Mack the Knife." 
</P>
<P>
But the board is not eating up the idea yet. Board members declined to make a 
decision after hearing a report on the issue Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I think of this," board member Charles Goldwasser said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the community thinks. But I don't feel the possibility of a 
fast-food franchise is an important enough issue to determine if we close 
campuses or not." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe more students would stay on campus if they could eat food that 
appealed to them," board Vice President Vivian Kaufman said. "School food has 
always been unattractive to kids. It was when I was going to school." 
</P>
<P>
Asst. Supt. of Business Richard Tighe said federal and state regulations 
specifying that half the food items be nutritious by state education code 
standards would apply to fast-food franchises on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Tighe said the district was required by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to 
serve a variety of foods. The department recommends, for example, that the same 
type of food, such as ground beef, not be offered more than three times a week, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, state Supt. of Education Bill Honig recently launched a "Healthy Kids, 
Healthy California" program that includes providing nutritious meals in school 
cafeterias, Tighe said, commenting that fast-food may not fit into that 
program.

GANGS BLAMED IN YOUTH'S DEATH, MAN'S SHOOTING

<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old Pacoima youth was killed and a 21-year-old man wounded in what 
police believe were gang-related shootings Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings were not believed to be related, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
John Duarte was shot once at 3:15 p.m. while riding in the back of a car that 
was pulling out of a parking lot at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Terra Bella 
Street in Pacoima, Los Angeles Police Lt. Bernard Conine said. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte died during emergency surgery at Holy Cross Medical Center, Conine said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Scott was shot about 9 p.m. on Louvre Street in Pacoima by two men driving 
in a blue and white Cadillac, police Lt. Gary Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center, where he was reported in good

UCLA FAN CALLS ONE AGAINST THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually, The Times' incredible bias against UCLA sports is at least subtle, but 
it was blatant in Jerry Crowe's article on the Louisville game. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe devoted more than 80% of the article to the goaltending call, ignoring 
some not-so-great calls against UCLA and glossing over the Bruins' rebounding, 
their low (number of) turnovers and their tremendous effort against all the 
players Denny Crum was able to shuttle in. 
</P>
<P>
Crowe devoted eight words to the man who knew best: "Was it goaltending? 
Ellison said he wasn't sure."

READERS ANNOUNCE THEIR WIDE RANGE OF OPINIONS ON JIM HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled at the demeaning, hurtful and obviously jealous manner in which 
Larry Stewart presented Jim Hill. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, Jim Hill, or any other citizen, can elect to return a phone call 
if he or she wishes. No one has any obligation to any reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Sour grapes has no business in reporting news. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hill's salary is and has been well earned. He has paid his dues reporting 
the sports news, and he is a gentleman. 
</P>
<P>
During the early-evening broadcast when he was approached about the subject, he 
never said anything offensive concerning the article. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hill does not have to show his teeth and grin to his viewers and bosses. He 
doesn't have to be an Uncle Tom. White broadcasters don't do this, don't expect 
it from our race.

MORALITY AND LYLE WHEELER'S MISSING OSCARS

I too am searching for a lost Oscar -- the one presented to my uncle, Victor 
Young, in 1956 for his original musical score for "Around the World in 80 
Days." 
</P>
<P>
Because I am now the only living blood relative of Victor Young, I want the 
Oscar for me and for my children and their children. 
</P>
<P>
No one can put a price on the Oscar; it means more than money to me. My uncle 
was a pioneer in the field of motion picture music -- the originator of movie 
theme songs such as "Golden Earrings," "Stella by Starlight," "Love Letters" 
and "When I Fall in Love."

Howard Rosenberg's Feb. 13 article, " 'Nightingales' a Hospital Case," struck

From indirect but close experience, I can say the truth is more outrageous than

FACES . . .: CAROL &amp; MIKE; FLO &amp; BO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Florence Henderson and Robert Reed know that for some people, they'll always be 
Carol and Mike Brady -- those too-good-to-be-true parents on "The Brady Bunch." 
And sure enough, the ads for their new play, Lawrence Roman's "Alone Together" 
(at the La Mirada Civic) trumpet them as "The Stars of the Brady Bunch." 
</P>
<P>
"My goodness, if I let something like that hurt my feelings, I'd get out of the 
business," Henderson says with a laugh. "Denying 'The Brady Bunch' would be 
like denying a part of my own family. On the other hand, some people fail to 
accept that we're actors and actresses playing Mike and Carol Brady. But this 
character I'm playing now is the total opposite of Carol. Carol was patient, 
sweet, solved everything. This woman is screaming all the time. She doesn't 
have a very high tolerance level." 
</P>
<P>
In the play, Henderson and Reed play parents of three grown sons who leave home 
-- then, one by one, come back to roost. Reed discovered the piece first, 
playing it opposite Janis Paige last year at Florida's Coconut Grove. Then in 
August, when he and Henderson were at work on the "A Very Brady Christmas" 
special, she innocently mentioned that she'd be doing the play at La Mirada . . 
. and voila. 
</P>
<P>
Reed has his own theories about the public's continued interest in the Brady 
family. "In television, there's always some curiosity about seeing what the 
people from old shows look like," he reasons. "And perhaps our show presented 
some values that we've begun to get a bit nostalgic for." Which doesn't imply 
that he's the world's biggest fan of the sitcom genre. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm an actor," Reed says bluntly. "I've been doing this almost 40 years, 
I'm now in my 82nd play. You don't always get to do what you want. Sometimes 
you don't even know what you want to do. No, playing light comedy for the rest 
of my life would not be my choice. But God knows, I like it every now and then. 
And with the ("Brady" cast), we all like each other; getting together is a 
hoot. It's like a family reunion without all the underlying problems." JANICE

FACES . . .: KENNEDY COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD KLADY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's an unexpectedly high time in the career of 74-year-old Tony winner and 
five-time Oscar nominee Arthur Kennedy. The veteran actor has two films out 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
First, there's the release of the restoration of the legendary 1962 "Lawrence 
of Arabia," in which he played Jackson Bentley, an American photo-journalist 
based loosely on Lowell Thomas. Then, next month, he plays a 
</P>
<P>
seasoned Maine shipbuilder whose business has fallen on hard times in "Signs of 
Life." It's his first film in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw in the towel in 1978," he says. "I got a phone call shortly after 
'Lawrence' in which I accepted an Italian-Russian film. It ("Italiano Brava 
Gente") was a huge success in Europe and kept me busy in mostly Italian and 
Spanish films for years." 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Kennedy felt it turned into a major career mistake. He called 
most of the films "stinkers." His feeling of isolation intensified with the 
death of his wife in 1975 and a series of eye diseases. Then, he lost his 
driver's license and decided, as he was still physically active, to move to 
Savannah, Ga., a city where he could get around on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to remember that Los Angeles back in the '40s was a small company 
town. The cops would actually drive you home when you got a little tight. 
Drinking was the major social activity. I can still remember Errol Flynn giving 
Ronnie Reagan a hard time on 'Desperate Journey' because he used to spill out 
his glass when he thought no one was looking." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy graduated from Warner Bros.' stock company in the 1940s to his 
Tony-winning role as Biff in "Death of a Salesman" and Oscar nominations as the 
crippled brother in "Champion" and the blinded war hero in "Bright Victory." He 
held a unique position in American movies for creating sympathetic though 
flawed and tortured individuals in such films as "Peyton Place," "Trial" and 
"Elmer Gantry." 
</P>
<P>
Not a believer in fate, Kennedy insisted that craft is the only thing that 
counts. Still, it was chance that led to his role in "Signs of Life." During a 
visit to his daughter, a New York-based actress, her agent told him he'd like 
to suggest him for a movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't give it much thought but, true to his word, he called back and set up 
a meeting with the producer and director. I read the script and was mighty 
impressed. The dialogue, the rhythms, had real quality. What began to seep 
through my troubled brain was that I needed a good part and here it was."

PLAIN OLD OSCAR

In his Feb. 16 article on the Academy Award nominations, Michael Cieply writes 
that "no film has ever won the best-picture Oscar without its director 
receiving a nomination." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it has happened twice. In 1928, the first year of the award's 
existence, "Wings" won best picture without an accompanying best-director 
nomination, and four years later "Grand Hotel" won best picture without getting 
a single nomination in any other category.

How pathetic it is that because of some quirk, a Long Beach couple, Sherry and 
Tom, came to possess the five Oscars of a talented art director ("The Diary of 
Lyle Wheeler's Oscars" by Daniel Cerone, Feb. 8). It is a measure of the 
caliber of these people that they refuse to be identified by their last names.

SOVIET CONDUCTOR SINAISKY DELIVERS A STUNNING TRIBUTE TO GLASNOST 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet conductor Vassili Sinaisky made a stunning American debut with the San 
Diego Symphony on Thursday night at Symphony Hall. Under his impressive 
direction, the orchestra turned his ultra-Romantic, all-Russian program into a 
resounding ode to the cultural benefits of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening measures of Borodin's colorful overture to "Prince Igor," it 
was clear that the 41-year-old Sinaisky, recently elevated to the post of chief 
conductor for the Moscow State Symphony, is no ordinary time beater. A smiling 
but commanding presence on the podium, his large gestures sculpted every phrase 
with unmistakable clarity and unerring emotional congruence. 
</P>
<P>
At first, his unabashed style was off-putting. Contemporary Western 
sophisticates don't wear their hearts on their sleeves, and cheap podium 
histrionics have given emoting a bad reputation. But by the time Sinaisky and 
the orchestra had traversed the lush landscape of Rachmaninoff's Second 
Symphony, only the terminally jaded could have resisted his approach. 
</P>
<P>
Sinaisky never lost the focus in the sprawling opening movement, and the 
scherzo was brilliant and exciting. 
</P>
<P>
When played routinely, this Rachmaninoff symphony calls to mind the cliched 
movie scores of the 1930s, especially the ones that shamelessly plundered this 
precariously overripe idiom. But Sinaisky knew how to paint the bloom without 
gilding the lily, and the orchestra responded generously, floating phrases with 
uncommon delicacy and building deftly controlled crescendos. Granted, the local 
violins did not display the sheen and uniformity of tone of their counterparts 
in larger and more finely tuned orchestras. When the State Symphony of the 
U.S.S.R. visited Civic Theatre last November, the luxuriant timbre of its 
massive string sections set a standard not likely to be surpassed. However, in 
this Rachmaninoff symphony, the elegant woodwind solos and clear, vibrant brass 
playing by San Diego Symphony members require no apology. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the concert, the audience was sufficiently moved to lavish 
lengthy applause on the musicians, instead of their usual perfunctory bravo 
immediately followed by a headlong rush to the exits. 
</P>
<P>
Igor Gruppman, the orchestra's concertmaster, took solo duty in Glazunov's 
Violin Concerto. It would be gratifying to report that the Russian emigre 
violinist, who has been with the orchestra for the past seven years, gave a 
definitive reading of this infrequently programmed late-Romantic morsel. Though 
he was sympathetic to the concerto's idiom and was able to spin out a pliant 
melodic line, he struggled with its more demanding technical hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Gruppman's uppermost range is sweet and delicate, but he does not project a 
large sound. For this concerto, it was too modest, too close in scale to 
chamber music. Consequently, the orchestra came close to drowning him out on 
several occasions with their accompaniment, which was spirited and properly 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be repeated at 8 tonight at Symphony Hall.

Soprano Christine Weidinger has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cal State Northridge student, who now lives in Germany and sings in 
major opera houses throughout Europe, has returned home to Los Angeles for her 
debut as the heroine in Rossini's "Tancredi," which opened Friday and continues 
Monday, next Saturday and Feb. 27. in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. She will 
sing opposite her mentor, Marilyn Horne. 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger, 37, describes her role as Amenaide as "the big plum." 
</P>
<P>
"It's with a very big company and it's with a mezzo who's a legend in her own 
time . . . this is a big thrill," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger credits Horne with helping her land this role: "Sometimes the only 
way a singer will make a breakthrough is if another singer will say 'she's the 
one I want.' " 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger said Horne, early in her career, suggested that she go to Europe if 
she wanted growth -- something Weidinger believes every international singer 
must do. 
</P>
<P>
At 21, Weidinger won a Metropolitan Opera contract. She was performing well but 
became frustrated with a heavy workload, secondary roles and missed chances for 
leading parts in smaller, regional opera. 
</P>
<P>
While on tour in "Carmen," Weidinger met Horne, who advised her to go to 
Germany. When the Met contract ended, Weidinger quit. "I just sort of lit my 
rocket ship and off I went." 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger partly faults herself for the way she left, and she blames an agent 
who should have advised her to "keep one foot on both sides of the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
"I was terribly ill-informed," she says. "A lot of young singers go right down 
the drain because they make one wrong career decision." 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger has thoughts of returning to the United States, but she wants to 
maintain her European base. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in a foreign country teaches you about your weaknesses and strengths. 
When everything seems difficult, you learn how to make difficult things easy. 
Singing is the easy part." PATTI VYZRALEK

Pelargoniums, various species

<P>
Scented-leaf geraniums 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen perennials, usually with insignificant flowers 
</P>
<P>
Crush a fuzzy leaf of peppermint geranium (Pelargonium tomentosum), and the 
scent will clear your sinuses and refresh your spirit. Rub a handful of lacy, 
gray-green rose geranium leaves (P. graveolens) and enjoy a heady whiff of 
potpourri right in the garden. Other scented geraniums, such as lime (P. 
nervosum), lemon (P. crispum) and apple (P. odoratissimum), enhance drinks and 
food such as sherbets, puddings and muffins. 
</P>
<P>
All scented-leaf geraniums are useful in potpourris and sachets, and some make 
excellent jellies. 
</P>
<P>
There is now a bewildering array of scented-leaf geraniums, including some 
combinations (mint rose, cinnamon rose, lemon rose) and a few very rare 
varieties (strawberry and peach). 
</P>
<P>
The scents are divided into general categories, such as citrus, rose, spice, 
fruit and pungent, but many of the more unusual scents are in the nose of the 
beholder -- arguably chocolate, for instance, but intriguing by any name. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, all pelargoniums, including the scented-leaf varieties, 
thrive in the balmy areas. They won't tolerate freezing temperatures, but most 
of them endure heat and drought with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
A few, such as apple, may be grown from seed, but most of these plants must be 
propagated by cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
Scented-leaf types can be small shrubs, lanky vine-like bushes or tiny mounds. 
Equally at home in pots or the ground, scented-leaf geraniums should be readily 
accessible for pinching, squeezing and sniffing. The plants do not release 
their delicious scents without some help. 
</P>
<P>
The flowers range from rosy pink through lavender to white, but they are small 
and not very exciting. Besides, with such great leaves, who needs flowers? 
</P>
<P>
The only problem with scented-leaf geraniums is finding them. Most Los 
Angeles-area nurseries carry only a few (rose and lime are the most widely 
available); Burkhard Nurseries, 690 N. Orange Grove Blvd., Pasadena, is an 
exception, regularly stocking about 40 varieties. A reliable mail-order source 
(also a retail operation) is Young's Mesa Nursery, 2755 Fowler Lane, Arroyo 
Grande, Calif. 93420 (near San Luis Obispo); proprietor Kay Young carries from 
40 to 50 varieties of scented geraniums; her catalogue costs $2, refundable 
with first purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The best opportunity to view and buy unusual geraniums is the annual Southern 
California geranium show and sale, held this year on May 13 and 14 at the Los 
Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia and sponsored by the Los Angeles 
branch of the International Geranium Society. 
</P>
<P>
Society members get first crack at all plants before the sale even opens, so 
non-members should plan to arrive early for best selection. Society membership 
costs $12.50 per year; write to 4610 Druid St., Los Angeles 90032 for more 
information. JUDITH SIMS

ROBERT SMAUS: TURNING ON THE BULBS IN THE SUMMERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Smaus 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While browsing in my local nursery this past week, I realized that there are 
many bulbs I have never grown. They are what some call "summer bulbs," because 
they flower in summer instead of spring, and they are planted in the spring 
rather than in the fall. You will find boxes and bags filled with them at 
nurseries now. 
</P>
<P>
Some are so spectacular in flower that I have always suspected they must be 
impossible to grow, so never tried. Not so, says Don E. Christensen of the 
Davids &amp; Royston Bulb Co. He gardens in the Pasadena area and finds that 
some of these summer bulbs will even naturalize -- gardener's jargon for going 
wild -- so easy are they to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most spectacular is the Gloriosa lily, a vining plant that makes 
lily-like flowers colored a shocking red and yellow. It is, in fact, a lily (in 
the Liliaceae family) and is native to India and Africa. It grows from a 
boomerang-shaped tuber and, according to Christensen, both ends are growth 
tips, so plant this one horizontally, not up and down. Expect it to move a 
little each year because after each season, new boomerang-shaped tubers form, 
and where there was one plant there will be a second, not more than six inches 
away. Yes, this spectacular flower will naturalize, dying down each winter but 
coming back for summer. 
</P>
<P>
Plant the tubers in a hole four inches deep, in good soil and full sun. 
</P>
<P>
"One commercial grower in Pomona grows his where the temperatures reach 106 
degrees, so it can take the heat," Christensen says. It will climb up whatever 
is nearby, or you can let it clamber up a stake. It grows about 3 feet tall, so 
it won't overwhelm its host. 
</P>
<P>
Equally sensational, bordering on ostentatious, is the tiger flower, or 
tigridia, a true bulb native to Mexico. (The bulbs are commercially grown in 
Northern California.) This plant has big four-inch flowers in a startling 
variety of vivid colors; most are speckled or marked in the throat. The flowers 
last but a day, but "it throws them continually," said Christensen, so it 
really lasts longer. 
</P>
<P>
The plant grows to about 2 1/2 to 3 feet tall, and Christensen recommends 
planting the bulbs in a hole four inches deep to help support the tall stems. 
When it first sprouts, don't weed it out by mistake -- the new foliage looks 
like a sprouting palm seed (a common weed in some gardens). Again, good soil 
and full sun suit it. The bulbs go completely dormant for the winter. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to see a planting of them in flower, visit Descanso Gardens in July 
or August. Director George Lewis notes that the first flowers in July should be 
cut off and then more will form and bloom in August. Make the cuts about six 
inches down the stem at a leaf joint or axil. 
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that other flowers can be grown on top of the bulb planting 
so there is color in between the flowerings of the tigridia. And, he said, once 
planted, "they will be with you for a lifetime." How about that, another that 
naturalizes. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if these two are so easy, surely the powerfully fragrant tuberoses are 
more difficult? Nope, these too can naturalize, though Southern California 
authority George Harmon Scott, in his book "Bulbs, How to Select, Grow and 
Enjoy" (HP Books), says they may skip blooming for a year to build up strength 
for the next time. They are grown here commercially, though most bulbs come 
from Arkansas and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Plant these odd-looking, elongated bulbs in holes about six inches deep, in 
good soil and full sun. Christensen says there's a secret to growing tuberoses: 
Don't let them dry out once the flower buds form. Expect them to bloom late in 
summer, in August. If you go on vacation, make sure someone waters these while 
you're gone. 
</P>
<P>
There are two kinds, one with simple, single flowers called Mexican Single and 
a double named The Pearl. Both are white, and the single-flowered form looks a 
lot like stephanotis, though it is even more fragrant. 
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian daffodil or sea daffodil Hymenocallis is yet another summer bulb 
that will naturalize in Southern California. It does indeed look somewhat like 
a daffodil, but one that has been working out at the gym (both are in the 
amaryllis family). The flowers are much bigger, fragrant and either white or 
yellow in the variety Sulphur Queen, and they are borne on sturdy stems about 2 
feet tall. The leaves, however, can be a little floppy. 
</P>
<P>
Plant these bulbs in a hole about two inches deep so the very top of the neck 
is just out of the ground. Again, full sun and good soil suit it. 
</P>
<P>
If it's not flowers you seek but foliage -- or, if you need something to grow 
in the shade -- try one of the other summer bulbs, the caladiums, which are 
grown for their colorful leaves. The leaves look like elephant ears but are 
marked with green, red, pink and white. Plants grow to about 1 to 1 1/2 feet 
tall. 
</P>
<P>
This one will not naturalize because our winters are too wet or cold, but the 
bulbs can be dug in the fall and stored until late spring. Christensen suggests 
getting the bulbs (actually round tubers) now, but waiting until May to plant. 
Keep them dry, cool and out of the sun in the garage in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
They grow best in partial sun but tolerate quite a bit of shade and will burn 
in full sun. They can be grown indoors, but need very bright light (but no 
direct sun); they are much easier outdoors, however. Plant the bulbs in holes 
two inches deep and make sure they go in right side up. The rounded end should 
be facing down. Don't fertilize with too much nitrogen or you will lose some of 
the coloring in the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Commercially grown in bogs in Florida, these bulbs like lots of moisture. In 
fact, all of these summer bulbs need regular watering.

FAMILY SPOTS: WHALE OF A TIME FOR YOUNG LANDLUBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN MELINKOFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whale watching from land is an inspired arrangement for families. Not only is 
it cheaper than a boat trip, it allows antsy youngsters to walk around when 
they've reached the limit of their whale-watching enjoyment. The National Park 
Service opens its whale-watch station today at Point Dume State Preserve for a 
six-week session. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, two to 20 gray whales were spotted every Saturday and Sunday, often 
just 100 to 200 feet from shore. Naturalists will be on hand from 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. to answer questions and provide information on whales, dolphins and other 
marine life. 
</P>
<P>
Although the whales can be spotted with the naked eye, the naturalists will 
have a few spotting scopes or binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
Even from land, visitors can observe "spouting" (the fountain-like spray), "spy 
hopping" (when the whale pokes its head out of the water to look around) and 
"breaching" (rising completely out of the water, turning sideways and falling 
back). 
</P>
<P>
The station is at the end of a sandy trail on an elevated area of coastline. It 
is not a difficult walk but is inaccessible to wheelchairs and strollers. Bring 
a picnic basket and enjoy lunch on the beach below. The station is open 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. weekends through March 26. 
</P>
<P>
Point Dume State Preserve is off Pacific Coast Highway, south of Zuma County 
Beach in Malibu. Information: (818) 888-3770.

DAY HIKE: GREAT VIEWING FROM O'NEILL PARK VISTAS NEAR EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The soldier who lost his firearm while marching in this hilly region with Capt. 
Gaspar de Portola's 1769 expedition would no doubt be astonished at the number 
of Orange County place names inspired by his mistake. Trabuco, which is the 
Spanish word for blunderbuss, now is the name of a canyon, a creek, a plain, a 
trail, a road and even a ranger district of the Cleveland National Forest; at 
one time it was also the name of a rancho. 
</P>
<P>
And if that negligent soldier trekked this way again, he would be even more 
amazed at the land itself, so drastically has it changed. But perhaps he would 
recognize Trabuco Canyon, at least that part of it saved from suburbanization 
by O'Neill Regional Park. Here the modern trekker can explore a small slice of 
the pastoral Southern California of two centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
This land of grassy meadows, rolling hills and oak woodland was originally part 
of Rancho Trabuco, two leagues granted to Santiago Arguello in 1841 by Mexican 
Gov. Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
The rancho had various lessees and owners until it was purchased by James 
Flood, a wealthy businessman, and his partner, Richard O'Neill Sr., a 
packinghouse owner. O'Neill built up quite a ranching empire here and elsewhere 
in California. O'Neill's Orange County property passed to various heirs, who in 
1948 gave 278 acres of Trabuco Canyon to Orange County for a park. Today, after 
various other gifts and purchases, the park encompasses 1,700 acres of woodland 
and brushy hills, taking in Trabuco Canyon and neighboring Live Oak Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
A good way to learn about the ecology of Trabuco Canyon is to walk the park's 1 
1/2-mile (round trip) nature trail. Trabuco Creek Trail, with stops keyed to a 
pamphlet available at the park's entry station, meanders through an 
oak-sycamore woodland and explores Plano Trabuco, or Trabuco Flat, a level 
alluvial surface deposited by runoff from the slopes of the Santa Ana 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to explore a bit of rural Orange County is to hike the park's 
various fire roads and trails on a route I've dubbed O'Neill Park Trail. The 
trail ascends to Ocean Vista Point, which offers fine coast and canyon views. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the San Diego Freeway in El Toro, exit on El Toro 
Road and drive inland 7 1/2 miles to Live Oak Canyon Road. Turn right and 
proceed 3 miles to O'Neill Regional Park. The park is open for day use 7 a.m. 
to sunset. There's a $2 entry fee per vehicle. Park in the day-use lot near the 
entrance. O'Neill Park information: (714) 858-9366. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: From the entry station, walk north on a service road that parallels 
Live Oak Canyon Road. (Children 17 and younger are allowed only with an adult 
because of the possible presence of mountain lions.) Soon you'll head left on 
another paved road that ascends toward some water tanks. After a quarter of a 
mile, leave the pavement and turn right on a dirt road on your right (an 
optional return route from the top). 
</P>
<P>
Continue your ascent along a ridge. Over your shoulder are two scenes typical 
of rural Orange County: red-tailed hawks circling over classic Southland 
ranching country when you look in one direction, and suburbs-in-the-making in 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
Continue on a last steep ascent toward what appears to be a "Star Wars" movie 
set but is actually Ocean Vista Point, sometimes known as Cellular Hill. As the 
name implies, it's a communications installation that helps car phoners 
complete their calls. 
</P>
<P>
From the 1,492-foot summit you'll enjoy -- on at clear day, at least -- coastal 
views from Santa Monica Bay to San Clemente, with Catalina Island on the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
For a different return route, head back 200 yards and make a left at the first 
fork. Descend to an unused kids' camp, then follow the park's service road back 
to the trailhead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
O'Neill Park Trail 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Canyon to Ocean Vista Point: 3 miles round trip; 600-foot elevation 
gain.

DEFY ISRAELIS, PARENTS;

<P>
CHILDREN OF THE INTIFADA: 'OUR BATTLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
TULKARM, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly, it is becoming an uprising of mere boys and girls, some barely old 
enough to spell the word intifada. 
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, a hard-core center of anti-Israeli protest on the West Bank, street 
captains in their 20s have organized younger followers, some as young as 8, in 
units that parade in the streets. They sometimes wear makeshift uniforms: trash 
bags pulled over their clothing, along with the traditional checkered Arab 
headdress. 
</P>
<P>
As comical as the baggy brigades might seem, they can be as menacing as their 
elders. One recent visitor to Nablus' market area was accosted by a group of 
youngsters who waved clubs in his face as they demanded all sorts of 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No, Absolutely Not' 
</P>
<P>
Here in Tulkarm, 14-year-olds standing on a street corner laugh out loud when 
asked if they would give in to parents who ordered them to stay indoors. "No, 
absolutely not," says Walid, a skinny boy in jeans. "This is our battle. The 
older people should not stand in our way." 
</P>
<P>
The Arab revolt in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, from the 
start spearheaded by teen-agers and young men in their 20s, increasingly is in 
the hands of children. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is that more starkly apparent than in casualty figures: Of 26 
Palestinians shot and killed by Israeli soldiers since the first of the year, 
nine have been younger than 16. The youngest was 11. Two were girls, ages 12 
and 15. Of the rest, only four have been out of their teens. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the ever-more-youthful rebellion reflects a hand-me-down fervor 
passed on by older brothers, sisters and cousins who have been the backbone of 
the intifada since it began 14 months ago. As older activists have been killed, 
jailed or gone into hiding, the younger ones have eagerly stepped forward to 
take their places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spurred by Organizers 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by protest organizers who romanticize them as "children of the 
stone" and see them as a means of keeping the revolt going through rough times, 
they often join the rebellion without their parents' blessing. 
</P>
<P>
"As the young people challenge authority on the street, it is not surprising 
they challenge it elsewhere," notes Jacqueline Safer, a psychologist and child 
development expert. "The youngsters become unruly and hard to cope with." 
</P>
<P>
But beneath the surface, some Palestinian experts see a broader breakdown in 
authority -- one with implications both for Israeli policy and for traditional 
Arab family structure. Some also worry about the long-term effects on 
children's emotional health. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, especially fathers, neither have exercised nor, in many cases, want to 
exercise a clear role as the enforcer of rules and protector of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a revolution within the revolution," Palestinian educator Assia 
Habash says. "The erosion of Israeli authority in the streets is extended to 
authority at home. If a soldier with a rifle cannot scare a young person, what 
can his parent threaten him with?" 
</P>
<P>
Already, the apparent lack of control over young people throws into doubt the 
hope Israel places in a new policy of penalizing parents, with punishment 
ranging from heavy fines to demolition of houses, to persuade them to restrain 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
Habash, who is studying the effects of the intifada on children and young 
adolescents, expects it to have a lasting imprint. "This is not just a struggle 
against the Israelis," she says. "It is a social struggle. Who will be able to 
dictate to this generation in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, one organizer describes the children's brigades as a kind of Boy 
Scouts for the intifada. Besides instilling a sense of hierarchy -- each unit 
has a recognized leader -- the groups perform routine tasks, like delivering 
bread to needy families during days when protest strikes close bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
"They are learning to organize, to take risks," the organizer said. "They are 
the next generation of struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Walid, the teen-ager in Tulkarm, puts on his best "Aw, shucks" smile when asked 
if he were not frightened. "You cannot say the children must stay indoors," he 
said. "Anyway, the soldiers do not discriminate about who they shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Girls, too, have taken to the streets, a breach of the usually passive role 
designated to them by traditional Islam, the dominant religion in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"We are like the boys -- no difference," said Bana Saeh, 14, a student who 
lives in Jerusalem. "We have to learn to do things like the boys, and they 
treat us the same as they do each other." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confined to a Convent 
</P>
<P>
Saeh is confined to the Rosary Sisters convent in the city under an agreement 
with an Israeli court. She and two fellow classmates are accused of throwing 
stones at a public bus. Their case does not come to trial until July; Israeli 
prisons were full, so the three are housed at the convent as an expedient. 
</P>
<P>
The girls deny hurling the stones, although not for lack of rebellious 
intentions. Saeh says she is prepared to go to jail if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not scared. Other Palestinians have gone to prison," she says. "Maybe we 
have to experience it to know the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
Among parents, this emergence of children as key elements of the intifada is 
viewed with a mixture of helplessness and pride. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Salam, 37, remembers clearly the days before the death of his son, Ahmed 
Abdul, 11, who was killed Jan. 12 by a soldier's bullet to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in one day with a scorched knee -- he had been out burning tires in 
the street. I told him he should be careful, there was danger," Salam recalled 
on a walk to the spot where his son was shot. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the boy's mother sent him out for tomatoes, telling him to 
hurry back because she was preparing breakfast. There was a demonstration just 
around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard shots, but did not think much of it. The boy was going for tomatoes, 
after all. His eggs were waiting," Salam said. "His mother was putting pepper 
on them, I remember, and someone came in and said Ahmed Abdul was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran out. Ahmed Abdul staggered from the street into the alleyway, here," he 
said, pointing to a clump of makeshift wreaths on the ground. "And fell. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it is hard to control the children," the father added. "You can 
never control them now. If you say no, it doesn't matter. The other kids 
encourage them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sign of Pride 
</P>
<P>
As if to show that despite tragedy and exasperation, he did not disavow his 
dead son's activities, Salam turned to the youngest of his three surviving 
sons, a 4-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was here?" the father asked the little boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ahmed Abdul," the child answered with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"And what happened to him?" 
</P>
<P>
"The Jews killed him." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you hate the Jews?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
In a refugee camp that adjoins Tulkarm just a few blocks from the Salam home, 
Ibrahim abu Sharif pondered a similar death. His son, Ali, 14, was shot dead 
Jan. 21 in a clash with soldiers. Abu Sharif said he was unable to keep his son 
indoors, and that even if he could have done so, he did not want to. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, no one can control at what age a boy goes out and joins the intifada. 
Whenever there is trouble in the street, everyone goes out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, if I could control them, I would not. They should do what they want. 
The situation requires that parents not interfere with children. We are in this 
together, and we do not stop anyone who wants from participating." 
</P>
<P>
But is a boy of 14 or even younger capable of understanding and making 
decisions in the confusing and dangerous circumstances of a popular revolt? 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is capable of differentiating between right and wrong, then he is 
capable of deciding to join the intifada," Abu Sharif said. These youngsters 
have seen their schools broken into and tear-gassed, have seen their neighbors 
beaten and taken away. They have seen a lot that we, when we were young, never 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinians offer an optimistic view of the intifada's long-range effect 
on children and teen-agers. Habash, for example, thinks that the early 
independence of the intifada generation will break down rigid, authoritarian 
norms of Arab life. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic. This interaction can produce a break in the usual 
top-to-bottom hierarchy of this society. A year ago, I felt the children were 
misusing their authority sometimes. Now, I think they have grown more 
responsible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Young adolescents and children also are acting as police in suppressing crime 
in their neighborhoods as well as enforcing commercial strikes by reluctant 
store owners, Habash noted. 
</P>
<P>
But Safer, the child psychologist, is less certain about the repercussions of 
such early and aggressive expressions of childhood independence. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of what the children experience -- the killings, the deprivation, the 
arrests -- creates a lot of tension for them. It shows up in anger. How it will 
be channeled will depend on what meaning is placed on their problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, if it is a message of democracy, perhaps democracy will emerge," she 
concluded. "But suppose it is just a message of hate?" 
</P>
<P>
Safer observed that children as young as 8 or 9 are forced to deal with 
disruptions of family life. 
</P>
<P>
"They are left unprotected at a much earlier age than usual," she said. 
"Parents, the normal protectors, are not capable of stopping outsiders from 
invading the household. The children are forced to begin to figure out how to 
solve problems themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Games played by children inevitably take on plot lines drawn from the uprising.

"When children play house, some take on the role of mother, father, children. 
And then there is the role of soldier. Mother wants to go to shop. The soldier 
stops her. She then tries a different route. The game continues until she does 
or does not complete her chore," Safer said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, drawings sometimes express the fears of children witnessing 
scenes beyond their comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen drawings of coffins and flowers, of soldiers hitting a door with 
rifles," Safer said. "Once, I saw a little girl drawing what looked like two 
scribbles. I asked her what it was. She said it was a child running around in 
circles until her head fell off." 
</P>
<P>
Dreams and nightmares also focus more on the intifada and the fright children 
get from it, according to a Bethlehem University study by Dr. Shafiq Masalha 
for Save the Children, an international relief organization. 
</P>
<P>
Of 75 dreams that related to the intifada, the study found, 58 had to do with a 
feeling of helplessness -- the father was unable to save his family from the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
Masalha said that in one common dream, a child will say: "The army entered our 
house and tied up my father in front of my eyes. I screamed, 'God help us, our 
lives are in danger!' Then I woke up." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, which is under fire at home and abroad for its handling 
of the intifada, has recoiled both at the increase in youthful participation 
and in fatalities. In defense of its policies of firing on protesters, Israeli 
officials have accused organizers of the intifada of putting children in harm's 
way in order to win international sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, an 
Israeli delegate asserted that children, along with women, have been dragged 
out of their classrooms and homes and forced to participate in the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
"Could there be a more blatant violation of human rights than sending women and 
children to attack soldiers?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
But Palestinians consider such statements to be a mistaken perception of the 
anti-Israeli enthusiasm of youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian leader who lives in Jerusalem, said: "I might 
have felt the way the youths feel now when I was young. But I got my 
information from books; they have known nothing else but Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
"They consider the occupation a daily problem in their lives, and no one can 
tell them they should not fight it."

INFORMAL OPINION SAYS UZI ALREADY IS ILLEGAL IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The popular Uzi assault rifle is illegal in California under current state law, 
according to an informal attorney general's office opinion being prepared for 
county prosecutors and local law enforcement agencies. Chief Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Nelson Kempsky told The Times Friday that a letter will be sent to local 
officials across the state next week offering help in prosecutions involving 
possession or sale of the Uzi carbine. 
</P>
<P>
If the opinion were to be upheld in court, it would mean that a state law 
making it a felony to sell or possess rifles under a certain length has gone 
unnoticed for years, as it applies to Uzis that are sold in California. 
</P>
<P>
Kempsky said the letter will, in essence, tell prosecutors, "We will cheerfully 
take on any cases that need to be worked through the appellate courts and offer 
our assistance . . . in information and research." 
</P>
<P>
The opinion is based on a state law designed to make it more difficult to 
conceal weapons. The law bans rifles that measure less than 26 inches in 
length. The Uzi carbine measures 24.4 inches with its folding stock collapsed 
and can be fired in that position. 
</P>
<P>
The letter will stress that the law is not "crystal clear," said Kempsky, and 
that prosecutors would have to be prepared to prove that the Uzi carbine is 
"intended to be fired from the shoulder" as rifles are now defined in 
legislation passed last year. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial opinion resolves a disagreement within the attorney general's 
office about whether a new definition of rifles contained in legislation passed 
last year includes Uzis, because they can be fired from the hip as well as the 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys familiar with the issue say that prosecutors will also have to prove 
that the Uzi should be measured with its stock folded, rather than extended, as 
is done by federal authorities. The weapon is 31.5 inches long with the stock 
extended, making it legal in that configuration. 
</P>
<P>
The opinion that the Uzi is illegal because of its length as measured with the 
stock folded has at least one precedent. The attorney general in Michigan, 
basing his opinion on state code language similar to California's, concluded in 
1985 that Uzi carbine rifles are illegal in that state. The weapons were 
subsequently removed from gun store shelves or modified to meet the law. 
</P>
<P>
Kempsky stressed that it would probably take more than a year for an Uzi 
possession or sale case to work its way through trial and appeal in California. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another reason," he said, "that we think it's important to proceed with 
assault weapon legislation (that would ban not only Uzis but other such 
weapons)." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Weapon 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-made Uzi is one of the most popular weapons among drug dealers and 
gang members in California, according to law enforcement officers around the 
state. California sales account for about 10% of Uzi's U.S. business, according 
to Action Arms, the sole importer of the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The semiautomatic Uzi can be fired either from the shoulder, with the stock 
extended, or from the hip, with the stock collapsed. It holds up to 32 rounds 
of 9-millimeter bullets, which are pistol rather than rifle ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Michigan attorney general's opinion, dealers and owners may legalize 
the weapons by installing permanent wooden stocks, welding the folding stocks 
in their extended position or by lengthening the barrels so that the rifles 
measure at least 26 inches. 
</P>
<P>
But a large part of the Uzi appeal, gun experts say, is due to the image of 
Israeli commandos shooting their fully automatic weapons from the hip, with the 
stocks folded down. The gun does not have much sales appeal as modified under 
Michigan law, said Ed Deershutzen, owner of Guns Plus in Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just a big clunky pistol at that point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Action Arms introduced a new model Uzi to the American public -- the 
mini-carbine -- with a truncated body but a longer barrel that causes the 
weapon to measure 26.1 inches, with the stock collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The mini-carbine is available in Michigan and could be expected to take the 
place of its predecessor on California gun dealer shelves if the original is 
banned on the basis of length. 
</P>
<P>
But the sales appeal of the mini-carbine is unproven. Action Arms reported 
2,000 sales during the weapon's introductory year, whereas more than 75,000 of 
the original carbines have been sold since the weapon was first marketed in the 
United States in 1980, according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the district attorneys offices in two California counties that 
are perhaps most affected by Uzi violence -- Los Angeles and Alameda -- 
declined to comment on the unofficial opinion from the attorney general's 
office prior to reading it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criminal Case 
</P>
<P>
In Alameda County, a criminal case is pending against a defendant for 
possession of an Uzi -- perhaps the only such charge ever lodged in California 
-- but the arrest occurred last year, and the significance of the case became 
somewhat clouded when the new definition of a rifle went into effect this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the confusion stemmed from an attempt to clarify the legal status 
of the Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Elihu Harris (D-Oakland), concerned with the increasing use of Uzis 
by drug dealers in the East Bay city, asked the attorney general's office last 
year for an opinion on the weapon's legality. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' query was based on the fact that the California Penal Code, as then 
written, made it a felony to sell or possess "a rifle . . . or any weapon made 
from a rifle . . . (whether by manufacture, alteration, modification or 
otherwise) if such a weapon, as modified, has an overall length of less than 26 
inches." 
</P>
<P>
Last Aug. 17, Allen Sumner, senior assistant attorney general, wrote to Harris 
giving a guarded unofficial opinion that the Uzi was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the legality of the Uzi under present law is not at all clear," 
Sumner wrote, "we believe that this weapon is already prohibited. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sumner went on to explain that the issue is complicated, in part, by the fact 
that the weapon has been openly sold for years in California without a legal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The Uzi has been on sale in the state for some time," he wrote, "indicating 
that local law enforcement officials have apparently concluded that it is legal 
under current law. This is a factor which courts would take into consideration, 
making successful prosecution more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sumner said in conclusion that he believed that a "sounder reading" of 
the Penal Code would prohibit the sale or possession of the Uzi. 
</P>
<P>
Harris subsequently introduced the bill last year to attempt to remove any 
confusion over the issue, including the prohibition of "a rifle with an overall 
length of less than 26 inches." 
</P>
<P>
But the bill also included the definition of a rifle that was not in the old 
law: 
</P>
<P>
 "As used in this section, the term 'rifle' means a weapon . . . intended to be 
fired from the shoulder. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The language is similar to the federal definition of a rifle and is the same 
language used in Michigan's gun code, but it alarmed some lawyers in the 
attorney general's office and elsewhere who had not seen the legislation before 
it was passed. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Deputy Atty. Gen. Blair Hoffman wrote in an unofficial opinion to 
Dave Karp, mayor of San Leandro, that the new definition of a rifle appeared to 
exempt weapons shot from the hip. 
</P>
<P>
"Weapons intended . . . to be fired from the hip, which are often more 
dangerous," he wrote, "appear to be legal and, indeed, unregulated." 
</P>
<P>
But other opinions within the attorney general's office and elsewhere differed, 
and after several weeks, the issue was resolved in favor of the letter being 
prepared offering to help county prosecutors in cases involving the sale or 
possession of Uzis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UZI CARBINE 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-made Uzi is one of the most popular weapons among drug dealers and 
gang members in California, according to law enforcement officers. Sales in the 
state account for some 10% of Uzi's U.S. business.

TEACHERS YIELD, TURN GRADES IN; 
</P>
<P>
THEIR CHALLENGE TO NO-PAY THREAT IS REBUFFED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thousands of Los Angeles teachers, rebuffed in court in their effort to protect 
next month's paychecks, on Friday abandoned their controversial pressure tactic 
and turned in midyear student grades to school offices. 
</P>
<P>
The action came a few hours after a Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed 
the teachers' union challenge to the no-grades, no-pay policy of school Supt. 
Leonard Britton. Britton had warned that he would not release the March 3 
paycheck of any teacher who had not filed grades with the district by Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
By day's end, it appeared that more than 90% of teachers, at the urging of 
their union leaders, were submitting the grades on official district computer 
forms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Pleased 
</P>
<P>
"That's good!" said Betty Sanchez, a senior at Roosevelt High School in East 
Los Angeles, one of many students who had worried that their futures might be 
adversely affected by the unusual handling of the grades. 
</P>
<P>
Britton, who has alienated many teachers with his pay withholding threat, said 
he was "very pleased" by both the court ruling and the teachers' actions, which 
will make official transcripts available. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 3, when fall semester grades were due, nearly three-fourths of the 
teachers at district high schools and about half the teachers in the junior 
highs bypassed normal procedures by issuing grades directly to students on 
union-printed report cards. The tactic was part of a larger boycott of 
non-teaching duties that union members have organized as an outgrowth of their 
year-old contract dispute with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that they had lost a round, angry teachers Friday vowed to fight 
on for better pay and more say in how schools are run. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ultimate Strategy' 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, 
said teachers had tried to devise pressure tactics that did not harm students, 
but they are now left with no option but to prepare for their "ultimate 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the school district substantially improves its offer over the next few 
weeks, we are headed for a strike later this year," Johnson said. The teachers 
are expected to vote to authorize a strike in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The contract fight appears far from over, but Friday's developments appeared to 
ease, at least temporarily, the crisis that erupted in the district one month 
ago. That was when what had been a routine labor dispute escalated dramatically 
with a rash of campus demonstrations by junior and senior high school students. 
The protests, some of which became unruly, were organized for the dual purpose 
of demanding that grades be filed in the normal manner and to express support 
for teachers in their pay demands. 
</P>
<P>
Before they began to taper off last week, the walkouts and sit-ins had become 
the largest wave of student demonstrations in 20 years on the city's campuses 
and helped bring forth a new, higher pay offer from the school board. 
</P>
<P>
They also contributed to Britton's get-tough stand last month. He invoked an 
untested, 100-year-old state Education Code section as his authority to 
withhold the entire paycheck of any teacher who did not submit grades in the 
official manner by Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The union challenged the constitutionality of the statute and Britton's action. 
But on Friday morning, Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs threw out the 
teachers' request for a temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Argument Failed 
</P>
<P>
Ruling just hours before Britton's deadline, Janavs found that the pay 
withholding was "inextricably intertwined" with the grade-filing boycott. And 
that, she ruled, was clearly part of a labor dispute that previous state 
Supreme Court decisions have found must first be handled through the state 
Public Employee Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Geffner, an attorney for the teachers, argued unsuccessfully that Britton's 
pay-withholding plan amounted to an unlawful taking of property -- the wages 
earned by teachers who have been going to work and teaching each day. 
</P>
<P>
But school district lawyers convinced Janavs that she had no jurisdiction in 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction at Roosevelt High, where one of the student walkouts occurred, was 
a mixture of relief and outrage. 
</P>
<P>
Several students were pleased that their grades were going to be recorded on 
official district transcripts. Senior Anna Gomez said there had been rumors 
that students "wouldn't graduate" if the grades were not filed. 
</P>
<P>
But another senior, Brian Carter, said he was feeling "confused." 
</P>
<P>
"I want them to turn in the grades," he said, "but in a way I don't . . . so 
they can keep going for (better pay) for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Math teacher Pierre Landa, walking to the Roosevelt office to turn in his 
computerized grade sheets, was philosophical. "It's just part of a struggle. . 
. . We lost a small battle, but we're going to win the war." 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers were boiling. "I can't stand to do it," said counselor Delores 
Seidman, who was threatened with losing her pay for not turning in grades for 
three student workers in her office. "I just can't believe someone can be 
threatened . . . with Nazi-like tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Chemistry teacher Tom Hake insisted that as a matter of principle he would not 
submit the grades to the district. He said he has been in class "doing my job 
as a teacher." If the district attempts to withhold his pay for not filling in 
dots on a computer forms -- "a job a monkey could do" -- Hake said, "I'm going 
to sue everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said they would appeal Friday's court ruling on a test-case 
basis, using one or more teachers who will not submit grades. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say negotiations, which are continuing, are making little progress. 
The district is offering an 8% pay increase for the current school year and 
increases totaling 20% to 24% over three years. The union is seeking an 11% 
increase this year and 10% next year. Another major issue is how the management 
of the district should be restructured to allow teachers at local schools to 
share in decisions on budgets, curriculum and personnel assignments.

SUSPENDED NAVAJO LEADER SEEKS TO REGAIN POST, TRIGGERS TRIBAL 'STATE OF 
EMERGENCY' 
</P>

<P>
A power struggle virtually paralyzed the nation's largest Indian tribe Friday 
as Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald tried in vain to reclaim office just 16 
hours after stepping aside to fight allegations of corruption and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre turn of events at one point left the 200,000-member tribe with 
three chairmen, two vice chairmen and an apparently hamstrung governing body. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a banana republic," delegate Anderson Tully declared as the 
88-member Tribal Council debated the confusing situation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retains Salary 
</P>
<P>
Declaring tribal government in a "state of emergency," the council announced 
that it had voted 49 to 14 with five abstentions late Friday to suspend 
MacDonald indefinitely while continuing to pay his $55,000 annual salary. The 
council did not account for the other 20 members. 
</P>
<P>
The historic action came just hours after the 60-year-old leader attempted to 
rescind the voluntary paid leave he had taken the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen said MacDonald sought to return because the council had rebuffed his 
bid to name his own successor and have the tribe provide legal expenses, office 
space and a support staff while he tries to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Operating in Limbo 
</P>
<P>
The council operated in legal limbo Friday, with no definitive opinion on who 
exactly had the authority to run the tribe -- MacDonald, his vice chairman, 
Johnny Thompson, or the chairman pro tempore named by the council, Marshall 
Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
The council recessed until Tuesday without addressing the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading home to explain the perplexing situtation to their constituents 
this weekend, the council decided to appoint an independent prosecutor to look 
into the allegations against MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Several councilmen described the move as an attempt to "clear the name of our 
chairman and the Navajo tribe." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Senate hearings this month into allegations of fraud and mismanagement in 
Indian country produced damaging testimony against MacDonald -- some of it by 
his own son. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald is accused of taking kickbacks and soliciting favors from contractors 
seeking to do business with the reservation. He also has been accused of 
profiting from a huge land sale to the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald has denied any wrongdoing, and no formal charges have been filed. A 
federal grand jury in Phoenix is looking into the case and has subpoenaed 
financial documents from the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the council suspension, spokeswoman Tazbah McCullah said MacDonald 
still considers himself chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conflicting Opinions 
</P>
<P>
She said the tribe's Justice Department had conflicting opinions about the 
legality of the council maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald did not attend the session and issued no immediate statement. 
</P>
<P>
"MacDonald is a very desperate man," said Stan Milford, his former campaign 
manager. "He's going to be indicted within a month. He's stalling for time. 
</P>
<P>
"He portrays himself to the public as a Geronimo," Milford said. "We say 
Geronimo was an honorable man who did not steal from his people. 
</P>
<P>
"We more or less place MacDonald with Noriega, Marcos, Kadafi and the shah." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leader of a campaign to recall MacDonald filed a $2.4-million 
libel suit against MacDonald and key aides in connection with an anonymous 
smear sheet circulated here, the tribe's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Without offering substantiation or attribution, the crude leaflet accused 
several MacDonald foes of unsavory behavior. The libel suit was filed by recall 
leader John Chapela, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
McCullah denied allegations that the three-page smear sheet either originated 
from the chairman's offices or was duplicated there. She said she had "no idea" 
where they came from.

U.S. Army helicopters evacuated about a dozen of the 37 Americans at the U.S. 
Embassy in East Beirut on Friday during a lull in three days of heavy fighting 
for control of the area near the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans were flown to Cyprus, the Lebanese army and Christian 
militiamen fought scattered battles, but a fragile cease-fire appeared to hold 
in most of East Beirut, where the fighting has killed 60 people. 
</P>
<P>
Christian leaders said later Friday that a permanent agreement to end the 
fighting had been reached and that militiamen would be pulled from the streets, 
but the army commander warned of the possibility of renewed clashes. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the three-story embassy building was pockmarked from shells, and 
all the windows were blown out. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman declined substantive 
comment. "I would characterize what we have now (in Beirut) is minimal staff," 
he said. "How long the people remain withdrawn depends on developments in 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"More generally, the recent fighting and the deteriorating security situation 
in East Beirut underscores the urgent need for all Lebanese to work together to

Friday's relative quiet prompted a few residents to venture out to buy food or

</P>
<P>
At midday Friday, calm prevailed throughout the residential areas but was 
occasionally shattered by gunfire from minor clashes between soldiers and 
militiamen.

U.S. VETOES U.N. RESOLUTION CRITICAL OF ISRAEL CRACKDOWN

The United States on Friday vetoed a Security Council resolution critical of 
Israel's crackdown on the Palestinian uprising and said acts of violence by 
Palestinians cannot be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was the only one of the 15 Security Council members to vote 
against the resolution, but as a permanent member of the council, it has veto 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Mission, trying to avoid a veto as the Bush Administration's first 
policy statement on the Middle East, offered an alternative resolution that 
contained implied criticism of the Palestinian protesters as well as strong 
criticism of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative draft urged Arabs to accept their share of responsibility for 
the cycle of violence and to be accommodating in seeking a peaceful resolution 
of the problem. But the nonaligned nations rejected the alternative draft and 
insisted on proceeding to a vote on their resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear to the government of Israel our opposition to certain 
Israeli practices, for example, expulsion of Palestinian residents, collective 
punishment, use of live fire in non-life-threatening situations," said Herbert 
S. Okun, the deputy U.S. ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
But he added, "Acts of violence perpetrated by Palestinians against Israeli 
soldiers and civilians are commonplace. Palestinian acts of violence, no more 
than those of Israelis, cannot be condoned."

The Argentine navy said Friday nearly all the fuel drums thrown into the 
Antarctic Ocean by a shipwreck have been recovered and no more oil slicks are 
visible, but American officials disputed that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
The excursion vessel Bahia Paraiso, piloted by an Argentine navy crew, hit a 
rock and partially sank on Jan. 28 after leaving the U.S. National Science 
Foundation's Palmer research station. 
</P>
<P>
The 350 people on board, many of them tourists, were evacuated, but penguins, 
gulls and shrimp-like krill were endangered by the estimated 180,000 gallons of 
oil that leaked from the ship's fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five percent of the drums of gas-oil (diesel fuel) that the ship had on 
its deck has been recovered," an Argentine navy statement said. "Yesterday, oil 
slicks on the surface were not visible." 
</P>
<P>
But Winifred Reuning, a spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation's polar 
programs, said, "There is still fuel in the water that can be seen. It's not 
all cleaned up. However, there are no significant leaks from the ship any more 
-- that's plugged up."

CUBA'S ANGOLA TROOP CUT DOUBTED; 
</P>
<P>
FRESH UNITS SENT, ERODING PEACE ACCORD, REBELS ASSERT

Cuba is undermining a new southern Africa regional peace plan requiring 
complete withdrawal of its 50,000 or so soldiers from Angola by sending in 
fresh troops to replace at least some of those it has removed, U.S.-backed 
Angolan guerrillas charge. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, officials of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola assert that at least some of the withdrawing Cuban 
troops have been sent to nearby African countries instead of returning to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Jardo Muekalia, chief of UNITA's Washington office, said that U.N. verification 
of the accord, signed Dec. 22, is so lax that President Fidel Castro's Cuban 
government can violate it at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"The accords will not be carried out unless the verification mechanism does its 
job," Muekalia said in an interview. "Only 90 (U.N. monitors) are expected to 
verify the withdrawal of 50,000 or more troops in a country twice the size of 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he had received no formal 
complaints of violations of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason for suspecting either side of violating the agreements," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tony da Costa Fernandes, Savimbi's second-in-command, has been in Washington 
for about a week trying to alert the Bush Administration to the dangers that 
UNITA sees in the verification procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Muekalia said that State Department officials "have listened to us and taken 
our concerns into consideration." But he said that UNITA has been unable to 
obtain a promise from the United States of any sort of action. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cubans Coming Back' 
</P>
<P>
"In the last two or three weeks, some Cubans have been coming back," Muekalia 
said. He said that the Havana government describes the action as "normal 
rotation" of its forces. 
</P>
<P>
"All anybody knows is the ships that took 3,000 (Cuban soldiers) out also 
brought some troops in," Muekalia said. At the very least, he said, the 
rotation will make it far more difficult to determine the pace of the Cuban 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the Cubans have sought permission to station some of the 
forces in the nearby African nations of Mozambique, Congo, Ghana, Ethiopia and 
Sao Tome and Principe. He said that Mozambique, Congo and Sao Tome and Principe 
"have already refused." But he said the response of Ghana and Ethiopia is not 
yet clear. 
</P>
<P>
Muekalia said some of the withdrawing troops have stopped in Ethiopia. Cuba 
says that the troops will continue the journey home after a brief stop but 
Muekalia said there will be no way to verify their departure from Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba agreed to complete the withdrawal of its troops by July, 1991, as part of 
a complex, U.S.-brokered agreement among South Africa, Cuba and Angola's 
leftist government. The pact calls for the first 3,000 troops to leave Angola 
by April 1, and Havana has reported that they already have left Angola to 
return to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
The pact also calls for South Africa to grant independence to Namibia, a 
sparsely populated territory on the southwestern coast of Africa that has been 
ruled by South Africa since 1920.

NORTH JUDGE LIMITS DISCLOSURE OF SECRETS, DECLARES THAT TRIAL WILL RESUME 
TUESDAY 
</P>

<P>
A federal judge, resolving the remaining disputes over the use of classified 
information, declared Friday that the much-delayed trial of former White House 
aide Oliver L. North will resume Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, issuing orders to limit disclosures of 
secret materials at the Iran-Contra trial, said that members of the jury he has 
chosen will take their oaths of office after the three-day holiday weekend and 
hear opening statements from government and defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting in closed conferences most of the day with prosecutors and 
North's defense attorneys, Gesell gave general approval to plans by independent 
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to consult with the Justice Department on unforeseen 
issues of national security that may arise during the trial. North is accused 
of lying to Congress and to a presidential panel about his activities on behalf 
of the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Question of Authority 
</P>
<P>
The trial has been held up for nine days because of disputes over how much 
authority the attorney general has to intervene in court proceedings involving 
questions of national security. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell originally objected to demands by the Justice Department that their 
lawyers be allowed to sit at the prosecution table, so they could object if a 
sensitive document were introduced. Gesell said that it would be too disruptive 
and that there should only be "one government" representative in the courtroom, 
meaning Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
To meet Gesell's objections, Walsh pledged to give Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
veto power over sensitive matters about to be introduced instead of having 
Justice Department lawyers sitting with the prosecutor. Thornburgh is 
responsible for protecting national security in criminal cases under a 1980 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell said Friday that he would allow such consultation by Walsh outside the 
courtroom as long as it "does not unreasonably interfere with the orderly 
processes of the court." North's lawyers had objected that the latest plan 
would "cripple" court proceedings by giving Thornburgh too much leeway to 
interrupt the trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek to Bar Use of Act 
</P>
<P>
They filed a 21-page document Friday renewing North's motion that the 1980 
Classified Information Procedures Act be declared unconstitutional as it 
applies to his case. Gesell made no immediate ruling on the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh will have the power to withhold evidence on a subject altogether, 
even if it could cause the dismissal of certain charges against North, the 
judge has said. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell has laid out general categories on what may and may not be disclosed at 
North's trial and has instructed government and defense lawyers to confer with 
him in private before raising any specific matters that are not clearly covered 
by his rules. 
</P>
<P>
Settling another issue Friday, Gesell heard final arguments behind closed doors 
from prosecutors and defense attorneys on the wording of a government statement 
about efforts by the Ronald Reagan Administration to obtain military aid for 
the Contras from foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
North's attorneys have argued in court papers that the jury must be told that 
Reagan and his top aides obtained this aid and ordered the operation concealed 
from Congress at a time when Congress had barred the Administration from giving 
direct aid to the Nicaraguan rebels. 
</P>
<P>
North attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said that this information goes to "the 
heart" of North's defense. But to shield the names of the countries involved, 
which allegedly were promised CIA support by the Administration in return, 
Gesell approved the wording of an agreement in which the government 
acknowledges that the Reagan Administration enlisted military support from 13 
countries. But the agreement contains no statement that this was ordered 
concealed from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The acknowledgement will prevent North's lawyers from identifying the 13 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
But Gesell said that North's lawyers may introduce evidence to support their 
claim that Reagan and key officials of his Administration kept the policy 
secret and "openly encouraged or condoned . . . (North's) alleged concealments, 
obstructions or incorrect responses" with which he is charged. 
</P>
<P>
North, 45, a former official of the National Security Council, benefited last 
month from dismissal of the two principal charges against him -- conspiracy to 
defraud the government and theft of government property. The charges were 
dropped after Thornburgh determined that government documents dealing with 
North's alleged diversion of $14 million in Iranian arms-sale profits to the 
Contras were so sensitive that they could not be produced in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
12 Lesser Charges 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the retired Marine lieutenant colonel is being tried on 12 lesser 
criminal charges. He is accused of concealing from Congress in 1985 and 1986 
his efforts on behalf of the Contras and of lying to the attorney general and a 
presidential board of inquiry about the NSC's role in diverting money from the 
arms sales to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security system at his 
home from an associate, converting to his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's 
checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury 
of tax revenue in connection with contributions supporting the Contras.

More than 65,000 homeless children fail to regularly attend school because they 
do not have transportation, clothes or the proper motivation, the Education 
Department reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our fears are confirmed," Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos said in sending 
the report to Congress. "Each school day thousands of young people are losing 
their best opportunity for a better life -- education." 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos said the statistics should be "viewed with caution" because of 
difficulties by state educational agencies in gathering the data. 
</P>
<P>
The report estimated that there were 220,000 school-age homeless children in 
America last year and that about 65,000 of them were not attending school 
regularly. Reasons given included a preoccupation by parents with finding 
housing, food and employment, lack of money for clothes and school supplies and 
lack of motivation.

BUSH APPEALS FOR VOLUNTEER SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
SAYS 'SUCCESSFUL LIFE' INCLUDES COMMITMENT ON BEHALF OF OTHERS

<P>
President Bush, seeking support for a budget that freezes overall spending for 
most domestic programs, urged Americans Friday to become more committed to 
voluntary efforts and told a student audience: "From now on in America any 
definition of a successful life must include serving others." 
</P>
<P>
Concluding a week devoted to explaining in public forums his week-old budget 
proposal, Bush declared: "Our budget is fair to recipients, fair to taxpayers 
and fair-minded in its strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The President, speaking to several thousand students in a field house at 
Washington University, said he is "convinced that we can help alleviate many 
national problems by substantially increasing the involvement of young 
Americans in voluntary service." Later, he ate lunch with student volunteers 
and participants in a Special Olympics being staged in St. Louis over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Standing under a banner reading "Students Who Care," Bush told the field-house 
audience that "from now on in America any definition of a successful life must 
include serving others -- in a child-care center, in the corporate board room, 
in the Rotary or Little League, or a tutoring program, or a church or 
synagogue." 
</P>
<P>
The focus on the role volunteers can play in the United States was a central 
theme of the inaugural address that Bush delivered four weeks ago. It is one of 
the President's answers to critics of his spending proposals during a period of 
continued effort to trim the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, we can show that what matters -- in the end -- are not possessions: 
What matters is engaging in (the) high moral principle of serving one another. 
That's the story of America that we can write through voluntary service," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The speech reflected what Bush has called "a thousand points of light," his 
vision of an America in which "our efforts must reach beyond government, to 
care about our communities and to assist our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has taken some ribbing over the phrase and he told the students that some 
have interpreted it "as a thousand pints of light." 
</P>
<P>
When the joke fell flat, causing not a ripple in the audience in a city known 
for its breweries, Bush ad libbed: "Surprised you didn't get that one here in 
Missouri." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, the President has made a low-key -- and low-visibility -- 
pitch in defense of his budget proposal. His aides profess to be unconcerned 
about the lack of front-page newspaper and network television coverage given to 
the President's other speeches, first in Manchester, N.H., and then in 
Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is it written that you have to have a video presidency?" commented 
Stephen Studdert, the President's assistant for special events and initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, while focusing on the efforts of volunteers, Bush again avoided 
spelling out detailed priorities for his $1.16-trillion budget -- a spending 
proposal, he said, that is intended "to complement voluntary efforts to help 
serve the gentler impulses of mankind." 
</P>
<P>
His tactic has irked Democratic legislators. They have complained that Bush has 
lumped $136-billion worth of spending on domestic social programs into a "black 
box," telling the House and Senate to freeze the funding at that total without 
offering them specific levels for individual programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optimistic Face 
</P>
<P>
Putting a more optimistic face than congressional leaders have on the talks 
that Budget Director Richard G. Darman has been conducting with senior members 
of Congress, Bush said that the "budget consultations . . . are making 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he has invited congressional leaders to the White House for 
another round of talks Tuesday, the day before he leaves for a six-day trip to 
Japan, China and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater portrayed the meeting as "a 
discussion of process" that would offer "an opportunity to assess progress thus 
far, to go over some of the numbers that have emerged in preliminary sessions." 
</P>
<P>
And, he told reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush flew here from Washington, 
Bush "wanted to build momentum while he is out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the budget's contributions to education, anti-drug programs, the 
environment and science, Bush told the students: "Our budget balances social 
concern with fiscal sanity and leaves power in the hands of the people. It 
shows that we can have a government with a heart as well as a head. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to reducing the deficit, some people say it can't be done 
without neglecting our urgent social needs," Bush said. "It can be done, but it 
can't be done with business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Bush argued that the budget he unveiled to Congress Feb. 9, which revised the 
fiscal 1990 proposal that former President Ronald Reagan had submitted a month 
earlier, "does more . . . for environment, more for the space program, invests 
almost $2.2 billion for the National Science Foundation -- a lot of that going 
to universities to help basic research." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the new proposal reflects increases over 1989 spending, but the 
spending in most of the areas Bush cited Friday would remain at the levels 
Reagan recommended. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to Washington, the President and his wife, Barbara, flew to 
Camp David, Md., where they were joined for dinner by Britain's Prince Charles. 
The prince is in the United States on a private visit to play polo in Florida, 
a White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Charles met with Vice President Dan Quayle at the official 
vice presidential residence in Washington.

Britain's Prince Charles shunned the spotlight Friday as he met with American 
achievers over lunch, accepted an invitation for tea with Vice President Dan 
Quayle and headed for Camp David, Md., for dinner with President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
On his eighth visit to the United States, Charles arrived alone aboard a Royal 
Air Force jet from New York for a low-key, 24-hour visit to the nation's 
capital. That contrasted sharply with his wife Diana's highly publicized tour 
of New York earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old prince rarely ventured from the British Embassy except for a 
scheduled evening helicopter ride to Camp David for an informal dinner with 
Bush and his wife, Barbara.

During the day, Charles spoke over lunch at the embassy with 16 leading

But, water district officials said, it was all but impossible to know exactly 
how many homes have been affected. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these vacation homes are locked up," Lake Arrowhead water district 
spokesman Simon Russin said. "When some owners get up here they are going to 
find 2 to 3 feet of water in their basements." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Could Get Expensive' 
</P>
<P>
"On top of the damage to their homes, they are going to have to pay for the 
water that went through their meters, and that could get expensive," Russin 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The problem stems from the subfreezing temperatures that enveloped this 
community all last week. Water expands when it freezes, causing pipes to burst 
and then leak when temperatures return to normal, as they did this week. Mild 
temperatures are expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"Pipes are popping all over the place up here," said Viola Hauser, president of 
the local water district. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda DiPietro, 31, a Lake Arrowhead resident of three years, discovered the 
problem on Thursday when she and her husband were awakened by the sound of 
"water gushing in the basement." 
</P>
<P>
"When we opened the door, we found our three dogs swimming in 5 feet of water," 
said DiPietro, adding that her family was forced to spend three days in a 
nearby motel. "Our water bill is going to be at least a few hundred dollars, 
and there has been about $2,000 damage to the house." 
</P>
<P>
However, the situation has been a boon for local plumbers, who could not keep 
up with the calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working 40 calls a day," said Cheryl Reeley, president of Doc's 
Plumbing, which employs four plumbers and four helpers. "The only reason we are 
not working 24 hours a day is the boys get too tired." 
</P>
<P>
Emergencies have been handled by local firefighters, said Alan Stocker, 
battalion commander for the Lake Arrowhead Fire District. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the freeze of Feb. 5, we've responded to 22 water salvage operations," 
Stocker said. "But the most we can do is remove standing water and move 
furniture." 
</P>
<P>
The water district's Russin said: "Hopefully, in the future people will take 
more precautions to prevent this from happening and make sure they turn off 
their water, drain their pipes and leave the heat on at a low temperature 
before they leave for an extended period."

ADVOCATES ASSAIL ARRESTS OF STREET CORNER LABORERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The arrest of more than two dozen day laborers as they waited for work on a Los 
Angeles street corner drew fire Friday from advocates of the city's immigrant 
community, who suggested that police officers overstepped their bounds in 
attempting to deal with a complex and growing social issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This heavy-handed enforcement tactic smacks of discriminatory and selective 
enforcement," said Francisco Garcia of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund. He added that the civil rights organization is considering 
lodging a formal complaint with the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the arrests Thursday at an active day labor pick-up spot 
at the corner of Main Street and Pico Boulevard, just south of downtown, came 
in response to complaints over the last two weeks from merchants about growing 
numbers of workers congregated there. 
</P>
<P>
While police occasionally have cited laborers at corners throughout Los 
Angeles, arrests have not been the norm, according to several immigrant 
advocates who monitor the issue. Several expressed suspicion of the 
department's motives. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they (police) are trying to build a case to ban day laborers from 
city streets," said Linda Mitchell of the Coalition of Humane Immigrant Rights 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of how the city should deal with the street corner labor pools is 
scheduled for a hearing before the City Council on Wednesday. Proposals have 
ranged from banning the gatherings to establishing alternative sites for 
workers to congregate. Police Chief Daryl F. Gates has expressed support for a 
complete ban. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Carl Wilhite, a Central Division watch commander, insisted that the 
workers' immigration status "had nothing to do" with the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
"We responded not because of who they are or where they came from, but because 
of the complaints from businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight men were cited for allegedly blocking the sidewalk. Of those, 29 
were arrested because they did not have proper identification, Wilhite said. 
</P>
<P>
Before someone can be released on his own recognizance after being issued a 
citation requiring a court appearance, they must present proper identification, 
Wilhite said. This can consist of a driver's license, state identification card 
or similar documents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warned Repeatedly 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite said workers had been warned repeatedly not to congregate at the corner 
over the last few weeks. He said they were warned again about an hour before 
police finally arrived to make the arrests about 10 a.m. Thursday. But Garcia 
of MALDEF charged that workers were arrested "not because they were blocking 
sidewalks but . . . as a way of dealing with the day labor problem." 
</P>
<P>
The issue has escalated because of the immigration reform law that established 
penalties against employers who hire illegal workers. This has led to growing 
unemployment among illegal immigrants.

JURY ACQUITS MURDERER IN JAIL ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted murderer persuaded an Orange County jury Friday that he should be 
acquitted of escape charges, because he had been beaten and had fled for his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
The Superior Court verdict, which stunned the Sheriff's Department, came in the 
escape trial of Ivan Von Staich, who has been serving a 37-years-to-life 
sentence for the 1983 claw-hammer attack on his girlfriend and the murder of 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich escaped on Jan. 26, 1986. Apprehended in Massachusetts about a month 
later, he claimed that he had been beaten by Orange County sheriff's deputies 
who serve as jail guards. 
</P>
<P>
He acted as his own attorney in the escape trial, using a rare, 
seldom-successful legal interpretation called "defense of necessity," as his 
justification for escaping. The defense allows acquittal on an escape charge if 
the escapee can prove several things, including that his or her life was in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the escape, Von Staich was in the Orange County Jail awaiting 
sentencing for his previous crimes. He will now be sent to state prison. His 
victory Friday means that he will not have more time added to his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I am completely astounded at the decision," said Lt. Richard Olson, spokesman 
for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Overtoom, the prosecutor, said he was "disappointed" 
and believed that "the jurors were confused" by the complex case. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments, Overtoom acknowledged that Von Staich had been beaten in 
jail but did not confirm Von Staich's contention that he was beaten by 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors acknowledged in interviews that they did not believe all of Von Staich's 
testimony. But they said the prosecution failed to disprove many points Von 
Staich raised, including his remarks about being beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew he was a convicted felon, but all of us on the jury decided he should 
be treated as innocent (of the jail escape charge) unless we found a 
preponderance of evidence against him, and we did not," said jury foreman Kevin 
Paul Little, 23, of Garden Grove.

CONDOM FAILURE STRESSED BY PANEL; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. STUDY URGES AVOIDING COMMON HOMOSEXUAL PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In more emphatic language than federal health officials previously have used, a 
U.S. Public Health Service task force Friday issued a new warning about the 
risk of condom failure. 
</P>
<P>
The task force warned that the risk in anal intercourse is so high that the 
practice should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
And it cautioned that -- even with a condom -- any type of intercourse with a 
person known to be infected with the AIDS virus is so dangerous to an 
uninfected partner that anyone in such a situation should "consider alternative 
methods of expressing physical intimacy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Panel Convened by Koop 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which included representatives of the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of 
Health, was convened last December by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to review 
the latest condom research data. Koop could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was released after publication by the magazine Consumer Reports 
of a new condom survey that ranked condoms by brand and model in terms of 
effectiveness in laboratory tests. The magazine, published by Consumers Union, 
ran the new study as the cover article of its March issue. 
</P>
<P>
The new federal condom policy statement reaffirmed observations by Koop and 
other health officials that latex rubber condoms "are highly effective barriers 
against the passage of the AIDS virus and other sexually transmitted diseases." 
</P>
<P>
But the statement emphasized that the latex products "are not foolproof." The 
warning, the task force noted, is especially applicable to persons who use 
condoms improperly or fail to use them from start to finish of a sex act. 
</P>
<P>
The statement avoided any reference to condoms made from lamb membranes, whose 
ability to prevent passage of the AIDS virus is in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A task force member who asked not to be identified noted that Consumers Union 
and preliminary findings of an earlier UCLA condom study both reported 
variations in effectiveness among specific condom brands. But the task force 
member said that the panel decided against issuing a statement on differing 
effectiveness rates and any need to shop for condoms carefully among brands 
that have been highly rated in laboratory studies. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't extrapolate from a small sample (such as those used in 
laboratory studies so far) to an entire product line," the federal official 
said. "Sometimes, a (given condom) will score toward the low end on one test 
and, on someone else's test, at the high end." 
</P>
<P>
The statement released Friday did not break completely new ground in its 
warnings on the inherent high risk of anal sex. Koop had warned against anal 
intercourse as early as October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday's statement described the futility of relying on condoms for 
protection in anal sex in starker language than federal officials have used 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
The practice, which is common among gay men, has been repeatedly identified as 
one of the two highest risk behaviors for AIDS transmission. The other is 
intravenous drug use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Inherent Risks 
</P>
<P>
And the conclusion about unacceptably high inherent risks in any sexual 
relationship with a person known to be infected with the AIDS virus was also 
more emphatic than previous comments by Koop. 
</P>
<P>
"This recent review by the Public Health Service confirms the fact that condom 
use can dramatically lower the risk of transmission of the AIDS virus," the 
statement concluded. "However, the effectiveness of condoms in preventing 
transmission depends on the way they are used. This makes it crucial that those 
who use condoms to reduce their risk of acquiring the AIDS virus do so 
correctly."

The City Council voted unanimously on Friday to ban the sale or possession of 
so-called assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
It also approved the purchase for police of 500 pistols capable of firing up to 
16 rounds without reloading. 
</P>
<P>
The assault weapons ban will apply to several types, including semiautomatic 
rifles that hold clips of 20 or more rounds and certain semiautomatic shotguns 
and modified handguns, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland ordinance is similar to proposals in California that are being 
fought by the National Rifle Assn. and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
There was no expressed NRA opposition to the Cleveland ban, perhaps because the 
group was unaware of it, council members suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no obligation to inform the NRA of what we are going to do," council 
President George Forbes said. "While they were watching California . . . we 
were passing an ordinance S that is going to be very effective." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, collectors of the assault weapons may keep them only if the 
guns are rendered inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
People found possessing any of the firearms within the city will be fined 
$1,000.

Police wielding truncheons broke up a protest by 2,000 students in the southern 
city of Krakow on Friday but allowed a similar demonstration in Warsaw outside 
the site of historic opposition-government talks. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw protest was the first legal student street demonstration since the 
imposition of martial law in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Krakow students, who were demanding the legalization of their student 
union, tried to march across the city, but police blocked their path and used 
truncheons to disperse them, a student source who insisted on anonymity said. 
"Several students were detained," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
The Krakow rally was organized by the illegal Confederation of the Independent 
Poland, a group the government claims wants to overthrow the Communist system 
and thus is not considered part of Poland's so-called "constructive 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, about 300 students marched from Warsaw University to the site of the 
so-called "round-table" talks, chanting "We want free elections," and other 
slogans. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, involving representatives of the government, the banned Solidarity 
union and other groups, are aimed at setting a course for Poland's future and 
the relegalization of the union.

COLT INDUSTRIES DROPS SUIT AGAINST L.A. WEAPON BAN; NRA CHALLENGE EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colt Industries, manufacturer of the AR-15 assault rifle, abruptly dropped its 
lawsuit Friday challenging the city of Los Angeles' ban on semiautomatic 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James Hahn said Colt notified the city that it had moved to dismiss 
the suit, and city officials anticipate a new legal challenge by the National 
Rifle Assn. against similar ordinances throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
The NRA said it will ask the California Supreme Court next week to rule that 
the growing number of local bans on rapid-firing assault rifles are an illegal 
intrusion on the state's authority to regulate firearms. 
</P>
<P>
A federal judge refused this week to grant Colt Industries' request for a 
temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the Los Angeles ban on the 
sale and possession of assault rifles, but city officials agreed to delay 
enforcement of the prohibition on possession of the guns until March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said Friday that the city will voluntarily maintain the moratorium until 
March 1 to avoid confusion. After that, he said, all assault weapons covered 
under the ordinance must be disposed of or rendered inoperable. The immediate 
ban on the sale of the firearms remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was unanimously adopted by the City Council on Feb. 7 after 
Patrick Edward Purdy, 24, opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle in a Stockton 
schoolyard, killing five children and wounding 29 others before shooting 
himself in the head with a pistol. Authorities said the weapons had been sold 
to him legally. 
</P>
<P>
At least six California cities have adopted similar ordinances barring the sale 
and possession of assault rifles, as has Santa Clara County, and nearly a dozen 
other cities throughout the country have ordinances under consideration. The 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has postponed consideration of an 
ordinance until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he is "gratified" by Colt's decision to drop the suit, a move that he 
attributed to the company's failure to win an immediate restraining order 
against the ordinance and to the NRA's reported plans to file a comprehensive 
lawsuit within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I think what's going on here is a little forum shopping," Hahn said. 
"The people that are going to be attacking our ordinance tried in federal court 
to get a temporary restraining order; they failed. Now they're going to try it 
in state court." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Colt Industries did not return telephone calls, and a secretary 
at the law firm representing Colt said the company would have no immediate 
comment. Hahn said the company did not indicate why it had dropped the suit. 
</P>
<P>
John Gardiner, assistant general counsel for the NRA, disclosed earlier this 
week that the organization plans to file a major lawsuit soon, probably 
directly with the state Supreme Court, asserting that most local ordinances 
adopted in the wake of the Stockton shooting unconstitutionally intrude into 
the state's field of regulation.

Great American First Savings Bank Chairman Gordon Luce and Southern California 
Edison Chairman Howard Allen were in agreement in 1986 when, as members of PS 
Group's board of directors, they voted to sell San Diego-based Pacific 
Southwest Airlines to USAir Group. 
</P>
<P>
The two former board members now find themselves with dramatically different 
views on the future of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
Allen is working to complete a $2.4-billion takeover of SDG&amp;E that would 
transfer control of the utility to Rosemead-based Edison. Luce, a longtime 
Republican stalwart who espouses free-market competition, recently emerged as 
one of the most powerful opponents of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a very unusual situation," acknowledged Luce, who has taken 
the decidedly uncharacteristic step of trying to derail a merger that already 
has been blessed by both utilities' corporate boards. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the reputation of our city at stake," said Luce, who has agreed to 
chair the recently formed Committee for Local Control, which was created to 
oppose the merger. "I felt very strongly about this from early on." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers Action Network, a San 
Diego-based group, maintains that it is "kind of ironic that San Diego's 
business community is responding to the proposed merger on the emotional and 
gut-level issue of who's going to control San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
"But, in this case, the consumer groups are focusing more on the facts 
involved," Shames said. "It is an unusual situation." 
</P>
<P>
"This merger has hit a sensitive chord," said Mark Nelson, president of the San 
Diego Taxpayers Assn., which has yet to take a stance on either the merger or a 
municipal takeover of SDG&amp;E. "The whole debate over merger or 
municipalization has cut across corporate lines in a really interesting way." 
</P>
<P>
Luce is opposing the merger despite the fact that, under his leadership, Great 
American has used mergers and acquisitions involving other savings and loan 
associations to grow from a sleepy, San Diego-based thrift into a strong, 
regional financial institution that does business in nine states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Concerns 
</P>
<P>
Luce is basing his opposition to the merger in part on concern that rates might 
increase and service decline after a merger. He also worries that as many as 
1,000 San Diegans could lose their jobs once the merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Neither do Luce and other local business leaders want the county to lose one of 
the few headquarters companies that can make major contributions to the 
county's charitable and civic organizations. Similarly, he fears that civic and 
business leaders will lose their relatively easy access to the utility's top 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
But Luce's opposition is based also on a decidedly philosophical issue: 
Utilities, he argues, with their government-guaranteed monopolies, are unduly 
sheltered from free-market forces. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Luce doesn't want to turn over control of that monopoly without a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
People have no choice about whom to buy power from, because there is a 
monopoly, Luce said. "If this were an S&amp;L merger, there are hundreds of 
other companies to deal with. . . . But on power, we have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
Other San Diego business leaders echo Luce's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Plenty of Other Airlines' 
</P>
<P>
"I was unhappy about the PSA takeover by USAir, but I didn't think to oppose it 
because there's still plenty of other airlines around," said Mike Madigan, a 
Pardee Construction Co. executive. But Madigan, a San Diego County Water 
Authority board member, was upset enough by Edison's merger bid to suggest that 
the agency study a government takeover of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be 200 home builders around . . . but SDG&amp;E is a monopoly," 
Madigan said. "And there's a fundamental difference between that and free 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
"If a takeover is not in the best interest of San Diego, then one alternative 
is obviously public ownership," Madigan said. "I don't know if municipalization 
is a good idea. But this is the only time we'll get to explore it properly." 
</P>
<P>
Luce's committee will oppose the merger, but it has stopped decidedly short of 
endorsing a municipal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce in September took the 
unusual step of opposing the merger, chamber President Lee Grissom has 
acknowledged that his organization's board would have to think long and hard 
before embracing municipalization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frustrated Enough 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in San Diego, another group of business leaders evidently is banding 
together to oppose a government takeover of SDG&amp;E, which has 1 million gas 
and electric customers. 
</P>
<P>
But some business executives in San Diego are frustrated enough to endorse a 
government takeover of SDG&amp;E. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm for free enterprise," said John Mabee, founder of the Big Bear grocery 
store chain and another GOP stalwart. "But I hope the CWA pursues (a takeover) 
because, in my opinion, under their operation, rates would be much lower than 
at present. I'm for keeping (control) right here." 
</P>
<P>
"There is no competition," he complained, adding that SDG&amp;E "doesn't make 
good, sound business judgments, and, as a result, we have some of the highest 
electric rates in the country right here in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Many of San Diego's business leaders have been seeing red ever since late 
November, when SDG&amp;E's board of directors accepted the $2.4-billion stock 
swap merger that, if completed, would create the nation's largest 
investor-owned electric utility, with 4.8 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime San Diego businessmen Charles (Red) Scott and Morris O. Sievert, two 
SDG&amp;E board members who voted against the merger, unexpectedly resigned 
after fellow directors refused to reject the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Sievert cautioned that SDG&amp;E's managers do not "recognize the profound 
impact . . . that will result as they become a relatively small branch of a 
very large corporation headquartered in a suburb of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor recognized Scott's protest by awarding him one 
of this year's San Diego "Seahorse" awards. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Economic Development Commission, a quasi-government body that 
supports economic growth in the county, has gone on record opposing the 
proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
That opposition is in stark contrast to the decided lack of reaction when USAir 
acquired PSA, or when La Jolla-based Signal Cos. disappeared during a merger 
with New Jersey-based Allied Corp. 
</P>
<P>
That past silence was in part dictated by "corporate etiquette," which 
"normally suggests that businessmen keep out of these things," said Murray 
Weidenbaum, director of the Center for the Study of American Business at 
Washington University in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But that code increasingly has been ignored in the wake of the unprecedented 
number of hostile corporate takeovers, Weidenbaum said. Local business leaders 
are opposing takeovers that "tend to change corporate control. These leaders 
don't want anything to upset the status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Weidenbaum has never come across a business community "that 
objected to one of their firms taking over a firm in someone else's territory." 
</P>
<P>
"It is unusual for a chamber to comment specifically about a particular 
merger," according to Roger Middleton of the council for corporate policy at 
the U. S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. "Increasingly, we're hearing from 
stake holders, which can go far beyond just the shareholders . . . to the 
community at large, employees, pension holders and retirees."

JOINT-POWERS BOARD PROPOSED TO GUIDE FORMATION OF SAN DIEGUITO PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The years-long process of developing a 43-mile-long regional park and greenbelt 
to stretch from Del Mar to the foothills of Julian took another step forward 
Friday with the proposal that it be planned and acquired under the auspices of 
a public, joint-powers authority. 
</P>
<P>
The park agency would be governed by two City Council members from San Diego 
and one each from the Del Mar, Solana Beach, Escondido and Poway city councils, 
as well as two members of the county Board of Supervisors and a representative 
of an already existing citizens' advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said they would wait until the joint-powers authority is formed 
before deciding whether to hire an executive director to oversee the mammoth 
project. Also unresolved is what agency will actually improve, manage and 
maintain the so-called San Dieguito River Valley Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's recommendations were made unanimously by a park planning committee 
coordinated by the San Diego Assn. of Governments (Sandag), with the same 
composition that would make up the joint-powers authority. The proposals will 
now be taken back to the committee members' agencies for concurrence, a 
prerequisite to establishing the authority. 
</P>
<P>
The committee members also agreed to ask their colleagues to formally designate 
the proposed park as "open space" or "regional park" on their respective 
general plans in an effort to slow residential and commercial development in 
the region they want now to preserve for public use. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the point where we must move forward, and this is a first step," said 
Supervisor John MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
The legal ramifications of that request, which in some cases would require 
rezoning of areas already zoned for development, were not discussed at Friday's 
Sandag meeting and will likely spark debate when the issue is brought up by the 
various local governing boards. 
</P>
<P>
Also still unclear is how park acquisition and development will be financed, 
although county Supervisor Susan Golding reiterated her proposal, which she 
aired in her state-of-the-county address earlier this month, of putting a park 
bond issue on the county ballot in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Such a bond issue, which would require a two-thirds approval by voters, could 
raise tens of millions of dollars for park development and would be a potent 
shot in the arm for the regional park, which now has only $10 million in state 
funds available. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the joint-powers authority itself, including the possible hiring of 
its own staff, might be covered by the county's proceeds from satellite 
wagering at Del Mar Race Track, Golding and MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more politically curious discussions Friday centered on whether the 
joint-powers authority should be headed by two co-chairmen or by a chairman and 
a vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Both Golding and San Diego City Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer have long 
promoted the park and the two women alternately chair the Sandag meetings, 
eliminating the possibility of one or the other having more clout. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer suggested Friday that the joint-powers authority be co-chaired by 
representatives of both the city and county of San Diego, as a display of 
cooperation between the two most powerful governing bodies working on the park 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But MacDonald argued that the governing board should only have one leader. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said she agreed -- and didn't care whether it was a county or city 
representative. Most of the others on the committee, including San Diego City 
Councilman Ron Roberts, agreed. When discussion moved around the table and 
returned to Wolfsheimer, she deferred. The question of who will chair the 
joint-powers authority will not be resolved, however, until it is formed. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed park would follow the San Dieguito River from its mouth at Del 
Mar, through Fairbanks Ranch and Rancho Santa Fe to Lake Hodges. It would 
travel east through the San Pasqual Valley and to the north side of Ramona, 
through the Pamo Valley, to the Sutherland Reservoir, and finally to the slopes 
of the Volcan Mountains near Julian. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the property east of Lake Hodges already is publicly owned, but most of 
the land west of Lake Hodges is in private ownership. The Sandag committee is 
looking for money to begin acquiring parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Specific park plans have yet to be developed, but generally call for hiking and 
equestrian trails, nature centers and the preservation of historical sites and 
wildlife habitats.

PORT DISTRICT EXECUTIVE IS CHARGED IN BILLING SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego Unified Port District executive was arrested Friday and charged 
with fraud for reportedly billing the port $5,000 for the purchase of several 
household appliances and automotive work done on his son's car. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Garrett, who heads port marine operations, was arrested at his 
office Friday morning. He is the highest-ranking employee to be implicated in a 
scam that law enforcement officials say has cost the Port District at least 
$700,000, and possibly $1.5 million, since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, who earns $63,419 a year, was charged with one count of conspiracy to 
defraud the port and three counts of grand theft that could send him to prison 
for up to six years if convicted. His wife, Judith, was named in the complaint 
as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lengthy Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The purported scheme began to unravel in November, when fraud investigators 
from the district attorney's office made their first arrest after a lengthy 
investigation. Three other former port employees and two former employees of 
Genuine Parts/Napa auto parts store on 12th Avenue also have been charged. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lantz Lewis said the investigation is continuing, and more 
arrests are expected. Investigators from the district attorney's fraud unit are 
also looking into other allegations of illegal activity by Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
Port District spokesman Jim Anderson said Garrett is still on the payroll but 
has been relieved of his duties. The port issued a brief statement saying that 
officials "will be conducting an independent personnel investigation regarding 
this entire matter." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, who supervised 23 employees in his department and has worked at the 
port for almost 20 years, failed to return messages left on his answering 
machine at home. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett was charged with purchasing a dishwasher, an electric wall oven and a 
stereo from Sears and billing the items to the port. He is also charged with 
billing the Port District for transmission work done by Bob Baker Chevrolet on 
his 
</P>
<P>
son's station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Phony Invoices 
</P>
<P>
Fraud investigators from the district attorney's office said that Garrett and 
the other conspirators submitted phony invoices and requisition forms for 
illegal purchases that were paid by the port. Typically, the port workers would 
order the products and devise a scheme using phony invoices that allowed 
Genuine Parts to bill the port for the cost of the merchandise. The false 
billings included markups of 67% by the conspirators who worked for Genuine 
Parts, prosecutor Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
The illegal payments were made because of a policy that allowed the port's 
purchasing department to routinely pay bills of less than $250 without 
question. A series of billings, each totaling less than $250, was made for each 
illegal purchase, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, former port employee Rudi Michael Enriques, a 
meter repairman, contacted a Sears salesman in 1986 to arrange private 
purchases that would be billed to Genuine Parts. The salesman told 
investigators that Enriques said that Genuine Parts would pay for the items and 
then be reimbursed by the Port District. 
</P>
<P>
The salesman said that Enriques described the purchasing agreement with Genuine 
Parts as a "fringe benefit" offered by the Port District to its employees, who 
would pay for the purchases in installments. Enriques, who is no longer a port 
employee, was charged in January with multiple charges of fraud and theft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Markups on Purchases 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant for Garrett, district 
attorney investigator Ned Downham said that Garrett purchased the dishwasher on 
June 5, 1986. The cost of the dishwasher was $546.49 and Genuine Parts is named 
as the customer. But a closer examination of the invoice showed that Judith 
Garrett was listed as the original customer, but her name was obliterated from 
the invoice, said the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
The Garretts' Via Bello address is listed on the invoice, which bears a "Paid" 
stamp with the name Genuine Parts Co. on the bill. According to Downham's 
affidavit, Genuine Parts turned around and billed the port $912.65 for the 
dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 19, 1986, Garrett purchased a wall oven for $1,114.99. The affidavit 
filed in the case said that the customer listed on the invoice was Genuine 
Parts, with Garrett written next to it in parentheses. An installation order 
written by Sears shows the Garretts' Via Bello address, and the oven was 
installed on Jan. 9, 1987. According to the court documents, Genuine Parts 
billed the port $1,862.03 for the oven. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is also charged with purchasing a stereo on May 17, 1987, for $432.96. 
Once again Genuine Parts is listed as the customer, but the invoice also 
contained a special instruction for the unit to be delivered to Garrett's home, 
the affadavit says. The affidavit alleges that Genuine Parts turned around and 
billed the port $723.04 for the unit. 
</P>
<P>
When confronted on Oct. 6, 1987, about the purchases, Garrett denied ever 
receiving illegal merchandise, the investigator said. Two months later, on Dec. 
9, 1988, investigator Downham interviewed Mrs. Garrett about the dishwasher. 
She claimed that her mother, who died in July, 1987, had purchased the 
appliance and she did not have a receipt available. 
</P>
<P>
During the same interview, the Garretts claimed that they had paid cash for the 
wall oven and the stereo, but could not produce any receipts. When Downham 
inspected the stereo unit and disc player, he noted that the serial numbers had 
been removed, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Garrett changed his story about the purchases, the affidavit 
said. He claimed that he had obtained the Sears merchandise through Enriques 
and said he was not aware that the Port District was being charged for the 
purchases. According to the court document, Garrett said that he went to 
Enriques because he could get a good deal. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest warrant for Garrett also alleges that on Dec. 17, 1986, Judith 
Garrett instructed her son, Todd, to take his Ford station wagon to Bob Baker 
Chevrolet for transmission repairs. According to the warrant, the next day the 
car dealer billed Genuine Parts for the repair work. On Jan. 14, 1987, Genuine 
Parts submitted a marked-up bill for $1,619.19 to the Port District for the 
work done on Todd Garrett's car. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Garrett and employees for Sears and Bob Baker Chevrolet are not 
named in the complaint.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A bank robber, whom police have dubbed "The Travelin' Man," struck twice 
Friday, hitting banks in La Jolla and Point Loma for a total of $1,200, police 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first holdup, the robber escaped with $200 from the Security Pacific 
Bank on Wall Street in La Jolla at 11:15 a.m. after showing a teller a note 
that read, "Give me your traveler's checks and money," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second robbery, at 12:42 p.m., the thief flashed the same type of note 
to a teller at the Great Western Savings on Midway Drive and fled with $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The robber, who police believe has committed at least six similar holdups since 
Jan. 1, is described as about 25 years old, 5 feet, 10 inches, with sandy brown 
hair. He was wearing a pastel jacket and sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
The robber is believed to have robbed the same La Jolla bank of $1,435 on Jan. 
9, Robinson said.

INS URGED TO HALT HIGHWAY ARRESTS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC DEATHS OF ALIEN PEDESTRIANS NEAR BORDER CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Citing the high number of deaths of undocumented pedestrians near the U. 
S.-Mexico border, two advocates Friday called on the U. S. Border Patrol to 
cease making arrests on or along three major roadways in southern San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Alan Nelson, commissioner of the U. S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, they also called on federal authorities to stop 
vehicular chases on the main roadways -- Interstate 5, Interstate 805 and 
California 905 -- in San Ysidro and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"We just want them to do everything they can to prevent these deaths," said 
Claudia E. Smith, regional counsel for California Rural Legal Assistance, a 
nonprofit group that works with migrants. 
</P>
<P>
The hope, said Smith, is that eliminating the enforcement activity will reduce 
the likelihood that fleeing migrants will be hit by vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
But a U. S. Border Patrol official immediately said it would be impossible to 
comply with the two requests. "We're sworn to arrest those people in violation 
of immigration law," said Armand Olvera, assistant chief Border Patrol agent in 
San Diego, who stressed that patrol agents are careful to avoid injuring anyone 
while making arrests or chasing suspect vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The letter is the latest in a campaign to cut down on the number of fatalities 
of undocumented pedestrians in southern San Diego County, where hundreds of 
thousands of illegal immigrants enter the United States each year. Many cross 
the grid of highways that converges at the border; others stay near the 
relatively dark highways to avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to the California Highway Patrol, 28 undocumented people 
were killed crossing highways in San Diego, most of them within a few miles of 
the border. Many are victims of hit-and-run drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the problem, the California Department of Transportation has 
installed a sign near the intersections of Interstates 5 and 805 warning 
motorists that pedestrians may be on the road. State officials plan to take a 
number of other steps, including the installation of increased lighting and the 
pruning of highway brush along highway green areas, where many migrants take 
cover. Other remedies are also being considered, including a reduction of the 
speed limit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, sent Friday, was signed by Smith and Roberto Martinez, border 
representative for the American Friends Service Committee, social action arm of 
the Quaker church.

MINISTER RECEIVES FINE, VOLUNTEER WORK FOR FAILURE TO REPORT ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A well-respected retired minister of a La Mesa church Friday was fined and 
ordered to perform 300 hours of volunteer work for not reporting a case of 
child molestation involving his church-school principal. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Gottfried Herbert Hoffman, 65, of La Mesa, who was pastor at St. 
Luke's Lutheran Church for 38 years until his retirement in July, was also 
placed on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Jesus Rodriguez also fined Hoffman $500, to be paid 
at a rate of $75 a month, and ordered him to show proof of the community work 
to be completed by December. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Have Received Jail Time 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman pleaded guilty Jan. 17 to the misdemeanor charge of failing to report 
child molestation committed by Eugene Petersen, 37, of La Mesa, who was the 
church's principal and seventh- and eighth-grade teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Petersen is serving a two-year sentence in County Jail after pleading guilty to 
three counts of child molestation involving two girls, ages 12 and 13, from the 
church's day school. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman could have received a six-month jail sentence. His attorney, John 
Meyer, urged that Hoffman not be given a fine or probation and that he receive 
a lesser amount of volunteer work. Deputy Dist. Atty. Aaron Katz suggested a 
$1,000 fine and the 300 hours of volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fine, upstanding man who has never had a hint of trouble," Meyer 
argued. "To end his ministry convicted of a crime is abhorrent to him." 
</P>
<P>
"Pastor Hoffman was unaware of the relatively new child reporting law. There 
were other individuals who knew of the law and did not report it," Meyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor conceded that Hoffman had led an "exemplary life." But Katz said 
that "these cases are extremely serious because they involve children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parents Sought Leniency 
</P>
<P>
The parents of one girl wrote a letter to the judge asking for leniency for 
Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
"We came to Pastor Hoffman to notify him that the molesting had occurred. We 
asked that this be kept as quiet as possible so there would be no publicity 
within this small school that would embarrass our daughter," the parents wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not want to press charges but did want to be assured that Mr. Petersen 
would receive counseling, have his teaching credential removed and be 
registered as a sex offender. 
</P>
<P>
"Please understand that Pastor Hoffman was trying to accomplish the wishes of 
the victim's family by handling this problem in an orderly fashion without 
destroying the sanctity of Easter," the letter concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Other people urging leniency in letters to the judge were La Mesa Police Chief 
Robert Soto, City Councilman Ernest Ewin and Chamber of Commerce Vice President 
Gordon Austin. 
</P>
<P>
But a Lakeside clinical psychologist, Diana Sjostrom, wrote a critical letter, 
saying Hoffman had covered up for Petersen before. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Adamantly Refused' Advice 
</P>
<P>
"Rev. Hoffman contacted me April 1, 1988, and asked me to see Eugene Petersen 
professionally or refer him to another psychologist who would not report 
Petersen or file a CPS (Child Protective Services) report on him," Sjostrom 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"I refused and quoted the law to him, and he adamantly refused to take my 
advice," the psychologist wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman declined comment after the sentencing, but he told probation officer 
Bruce Fox that "my intent was to give pastoral care to two females in my parish 
and to protect the victims from needless notoriety." 
</P>
<P>
"These proceedings have caused my family and me great anguish and suffering, 
for which I am truly sorry," Hoffman said, according to Fox's probation report. 
</P>
<P>
The probation officer wrote that Hoffman was quite concerned about the 
child-molestation allegations disturbing the Easter activities of the church at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman told Fox that he felt bound by the confidentiality of his role as a 
pastor not to reveal the molestation.

USD TO TAKE SECOND SHOT AT ST. MARY'S

After being bombarded with offense in four games over two weekends against 
Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount, the University of San Diego men's basketball 
team faced defense-minded St. Mary's College Wednesday in Moraga. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's is third in the NCAA in scoring defense and field-goal percentage 
defense. The Toreros found out why, shooting just 39% from the field in a 70-45 
loss at McKeon Pavilion. The 45 points were the fewest USD had scored this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at 7:30 p.m. at the USD Sports Center, the Toreros get another shot at 
figuring out the Gaels' mixture of zone defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, St. Mary's finished 10-17, 3-11 (seventh in the West Coast 
Athletic Conference). The following year under new Coach Lynn Nance, the Gaels 
were 17-13, 7-7. Last season, they were 19-9, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
This season, with five senior starters and a good supporting cast, St. Mary's 
is 21-3 and 9-2. USD Coach Hank Egan and others say this private school of 
2,200 students is headed for the NCAA tournament regardless of its finish in 
the WCAC tournament March 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
USD, on the other hand, has lost five games in a row and 12 of 13 for a record 
of 6-17, 1-10 in the WCAC. JIM LINDGREN

SOCKERS' 6-2 VICTORY HAS ROUGH EDGE TO IT

<P>
Those who have been calling for a National Hockey League franchise in San Diego 
would have enjoyed the Sockers' 6-2 victory over the Tacoma Stars Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But they might have been the only ones. 
</P>
<P>
Players on both sides were ducking for cover -- especially late in the fourth 
quarter -- after a game's worth of flying elbows and flying tackles seemed to 
turn the Sports Arena into a hockey rink. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 7,630 fans were even skating on thin ice late in the game when they 
started throwing objects at the Tacoma bench. 
</P>
<P>
But the bench may have been the safest place to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really just a vicious game all the way around," Tacoma Coach Alan 
Hinton said. "San Diego won in the elbow-throwing department, and we won in the 
tackling department." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers (15-13) won on the scoreboard, too, and as a result hung on to sole 
possession of second place in the Major Indoor Soccer League, 4 1/2 games 
behind the Baltimore Blast. 
</P>
<P>
But winning wasn't the only thing in this one. Survival was also important. 
</P>
<P>
"I was actually worried about myself late in the fourth quarter," said Socker 
midfielder Branko Segota, who had two goals and two assists. "They were really 
coming after us." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Tacoma could have been wondering what Segota and other All-Stars 
such as Kevin Crow were doing still on the field in the final 2 minutes with 
the Sockers ahead by three. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just trying to run out the clock," was Coach Ron Newman's answer. 
</P>
<P>
That obviously didn't satisfy the Stars, who committed three somewhat flagrant 
tripping penalties in the final moments, drawing the fans' ire and forcing the 
deployment of two of San Diego's finest behind the Tacoma bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really disappointed in the way this one finished up," Newman said. "We're 
all supposed to be in this sport together, and they had guys going after our 
people's legs. I'm just glad we got out of here unscathed." 
</P>
<P>
The finger-pointing actually started midway through the second quarter, when 
Segota hit Stars defender Neil Megson with a forearm and was in turn thrown to 
the ground by Megson. Both benches then emptied. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties were sorted out, and the teams played three-on-three for a while, but 
nothing critical to the game's outcome came out of it. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome wasn't decided, in fact, until the fourth quarter, when a goal by 
George Fernandez and two by Segota increased a 3-2 Socker lead to the final 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Preki had scored twice to give Tacoma a 2-1 lead in the second 
quarter. But Zoran Karic scored on a pass from Segota to tie the game, 2-2, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The second half then got a bit ugly, with the Sockers stopping long enough to 
score four unanswered goals and win their second game in the past three. 
</P>
<P>
The next round is Sunday night in Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
A headline from Friday's Morning News Tribune, a daily newspaper in Tacoma: 
"Stars will return for another year." Richard Waltman, a board member and 
spokesman for the Stars' ownership made the announcement Thursday night 
following a meeting of the team's shareholders. "We discussed the future of the 
franchise, and I am pleased to announce that our shareholders voted 
overwhelmingly to continue operations this year and to continue operations for 
the 1989-90 season." The announcement is good news for the Major Indoor Soccer 
League, which needs some. Just two weeks ago, in fact, word out of Tacoma was 
that the franchise needed more money to continue operations. 
</P>
<P>
Socker goalkeeper Zoltan Toth is still suffering from an inflamed bunion on his 
left foot and Friday was replaced on the MISL All-Star roster by Wichita's Cris 
Vaccaro. Toth was fitted with a special shoe by Socker trainer Bill Taylor this 
week to try and protect the injury, but Toth said he still felt a lot of 
discomfort. "A month has passed (Toth was injured Jan. 14), and it hasn't 
gotten any better," Toth said. Brian Quinn, the Socker midfielder who has been 
out for two weeks with a foot injury, was also replaced on the All-Star roster, 
by Jan Goossens of Kansas City. . . . The Sockers have signed former San Diego 
State goalkeeper Felipe Hernandez to a 10-day contract for the second time this 
season to replace Toth. Hernandez hasn't played yet, and he didn't dress for 
Friday night's game. . . . Kevin Crow's first-quarter goal was his 23rd point 
of the season, a career high. . . . Three players who won't get career highs 
this season: Poli Garcia (50 goals last season with St. Louis, one this 
season), Chris Chueden (26 goals last season with the Los Angeles Lazers, one 
this season) and Paul Dougherty (40 goals last season for the Sockers, six this 
year and only one at home).

SDSU, WYOMING MEET AT WAC CELLAR DOOR; 
</P>
<P>
A DISAPPOINTING SEASON WILL GET WORSE FOR ONE OF THESE TEAMS TONIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
How the mighty have fallen and the aspiring have stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
That might be the kindest way to sum up tonight's (6:30 PST) Western Athletic 
Conference basketball game between San Diego State and Wyoming at Wyoming's 
Arena-Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Another, less delicate, way would be to call it a matchup for last place, 
because despite these teams' earlier aspirations, that is what this late-season 
game has become. 
</P>
<P>
The loser will occupy sole possession of ninth place. The best the winner can 
hope to do is stave off for another game the likely possibility that it will 
end up playing in the preliminary game of WAC tournament, a lonely affair that 
matches the conference's eighth- and ninth-place teams in an elimination game 
to find a quarterfinal opponent for the regular-season champion. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is quite a comedown for Wyoming (11-14, 3-8 in WAC), which a year 
ago was a Top 20 team that played for the WAC tournament championship. And it 
sits no better with the Aztecs (10-13, 4-9), who, after winning their first two 
conference games, have lost nine of 11. One exception is a 69-61 home victory 
over Wyoming Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to start regrouping pretty quick and get some momentum," 
SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "I thought we had done a really nice job of 
getting some momentum last week against Brigham Young, and then we had another 
setback (home losses to Utah and Hawaii). We have got to find another impetus 
to get us some momentum and some confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the Aztecs' task is a schedule that has them playing their final 
three conference games on the road, including a swing to New Mexico and Texas 
El Paso, the league's top two teams. None of this is an inviting prospect for a 
team that has lost 23 of its past 24 conference games outside of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are 0-5 on the road this season in the WAC and have lost seven road 
games in a row since an 83-58 victory at Baylor Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any consolation for the Aztecs, it is that at least Wyoming has had 
its troubles at home. The Cowboys are 1-4 in conference home games, and the 
usually raucous Arena-Auditorium has been rather empty of late. 
</P>
<P>
Average attendance has fallen to 5,904, a precipitous drop from last season's 
record 13,165 and the smallest home average since the Cowboys moved into the 
building for the 1982-83 season. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a rebuilding situation for them, and yet they are really a dangerous 
club," Brandenburg said. "They have started to spread it out and really control 
games on the road. They have done an excellent job of controlling tempo. . . . 
The real question is whether they will try to spread it out at home because I'm 
not sure how well-accepted that ploy will be with crowd at home."

MISSED CHANCES COST CRESPI AT CAMARILLO, 58-50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo High staged a clinic on how not to shoot free throws. Crespi learned 
the lesson well. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions, after making only one of six free throws and scoring seven 
points in the first quarter, held on to win a second-round Southern Section 
4-AA Division boys' playoff game, 58-50, when Crespi encountered similar 
difficulties from the line in the fourth quarter Friday at Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi, which had trimmed a 16-point deficit to four points, converted only 
five of 11 free throws in the fourth quarter as Camarillo advanced to a 
third-round encounter against Glendora, a 109-60 winner over Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
"We made a good run but we didn't help ourselves from the free-throw line," 
Crespi Coach Paul Muff said. "We had a shot to come within a basket . . . we 
just didn't hit the free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Crespi trailed, 38-22, midway through the third quarter before staging a 23-11 
run to pull to within four with 2:31 remaining. But, while the Celts (11-12 
overall) were missing three of their next six free throws, Camarillo (18-6) 
converted six of nine to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi trailed by five with 13 seconds remaining, but Chris McGee missed two 
free throws and Camarillo's Jason Hunt made both ends of a one-and-one 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
For the game, Camarillo converted 18 of 31 free throws; Crespi made 14 of 26. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt we'd pull it out," Camarillo's David Harbour said. "I knew if we kept 
playing hard and I made my free throws -- or we made our free throws -- that 
we'd win." 
</P>
<P>
Harbour didn't but Camarillo did. The 6-foot-1 sophomore guard scored a 
game-high 21 points but made only five of 14 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"That's David, either make them all or miss them all," said Camarillo Coach 
John Harbour, David's father. 
</P>
<P>
Said David Harbour: "This was the first game I've ever played in the playoffs. 
I think it was just playoff jitters." 
</P>
<P>
David Harbour was not the only nervous Scorpion. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tight," John Harbour said. "We had this thing in our heads about it 
being the playoffs."

<P>
RESEDA DOMINATES 2ND HALF OF VICTORY OVER PALISADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a half, the Reseda High girls' basketball team was locked in a tight game 
Friday night against Palisades in a City Section 4-A Division first-round 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Regents, the two-time 3-A champions who stepped up to the 4-A this 
season, broke open the game in the third quarter and coasted to an 82-52 win at 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda, which led at halftime, 37-32, outscored the Dolphins, 26-9, in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Marzahl scored 22 points, Cheryl Hightower had 21 and Aggie Garcia 
added 17 for the Regents (15-4). Palisades (16-5) was led by guard Valerie

TOP NORTHRIDGE PERFORMERS TO MISS OPENING TRACK MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the track and field season begins today for Cal State Northridge, some 
of the Matadors' top performers will not compete in the seven-team non-scoring 
meet at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy Arreola and Will James, NCAA Division II All-Americans, will be among 
those Northridge athletes who will not race until March 4. All-American hurdler 
Tyrone Jeffries will compete, but in the sprints, not in his specialties. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Northridge, teams from USC (men only), Azusa Pacific, Cal 
Lutheran, Cal State Fullerton, Westmont and Valley College have entered. 
</P>
<P>
Field events will begin at 11 a.m. and running events at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
USC is sending a team, but it will not include freshman sprinter Quincy Watts, 
who won three state titles during his career at Taft High. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the recent weather caused a lot of people to alter some workouts, 
everyone is treating this meet real tenderly," Northridge Coach Don Strametz 
said. "I think you'll see some competitive races, but I don't expect to see a 
lot of great times. It's just too early in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the NCAA Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000 meters, 
redshirted the 1988 cross-country season because a long and arduous track 
season left her injured and mentally fatigued. She is healthy again but will 
not compete until a five-team meet at Northridge in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
James set the school record of 3 minutes, 43.42 seconds in the 1,500 meters 
while placing fifth in the 1987 Division II championships but redshirted last 
season because of an injury. He suffered a similar -- though less serious -- 
injury three weeks ago but also is expected to race in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A fine group of Northridge freshmen will be on display today, including former 
Saugus High standout Damiean Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins placed third in the discus in last year's state championships at 
Cerritos College with a personal best of 178 feet, 11 inches. JOHN ORTEGA

PRIME TICKET DENIES DEAL TIED TO CCAA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of Sportsworks, an arm of California Sports, Inc., parent company of 
the Los Angeles Lakers, approached the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in 
October for the rights to package a broadcast of the men's and women's 
postseason tournament championship games. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, CCAA Commissioner Tom Morgan said, Sportsworks made it 
clear that it already had secured air time on the Prime Ticket cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Don Corsene, Prime Ticket vice president of programming and 
production, said that he had never heard of Sportsworks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are booked through April, so there is no way that it will be on, even on 
tape delay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Prime Ticket programming employees also had never heard of 
Sportsworks. Nevertheless, Prime Ticket and Sportsworks have offices in the 
same building across from the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Crossland, a representative of Sportsworks, said that a person in her firm 
had secured air time for the games on Prime Ticket but only on a tape-delay 
basis. However, she said that she could not remember who had arranged the air 
time or the name of the person at Prime Ticket with whom her firm had dealt. 
</P>
<P>
Crossland said that Sportsworks was trying to put together a network of 
independent TV stations in cities that have CCAA teams. She named KCOY in San 
Luis Obispo and KEYT in Santa Barbara but was unsure whether a Los Angeles-area 
station would carry the games. Six of the eight schools in the CCAA are 
serviced by L. A. television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Crossland added that Sportsworks has failed to secure a single sponsor for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
"It's down to the point where we are going to have to cut it off," she said of 
the effort to put the games on TV. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has signed on the dotted line yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Brahma ball: The Pierce College volleyball team began defense of its state 
title with a win over Golden West last Friday, but the Brahmas figure to be 
severely tested in South Coast Conference play this season by powerful Orange 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce Coach Ken Stanley has eight players back from last season's team that 
finished 18-3, including all-conference outside hitter Rico Guimaraes, middle 
blocker Turhan Douglas and Terry Schrumpf, who plays opposite the setter in 
Pierce's 5-2 attack. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast has four players returning from a team that won the state title in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty big and we have good balance," said Stanley, who begins his 12th 
season with the Brahmas, "but Orange Coast is, far and away, the class of the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
The Brahmas play host to Orange Coast on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Streaking Cougars: The College of the Canyons baseball team will put its 
38-game home win streak on the line next Wednesday when the Cougars (3-4) play 
host to Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Len Mohney said that his team does not feel pressure to keep the streak 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"With this group this year, we have other things to worry about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Catching Waves: Andy Lopez, the former baseball coach at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills who is in his first season at Pepperdine, says he has had to make 
adjustments now that he is at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
"You spend a lot more time recruiting and talking to young men who are 
recruiting us," said Lopez, who replaced Dave Gorrie as coach of the Waves. "At 
Dominguez, if we wanted to go out and recruit someone this early, they were 
thinking about Pepperdine." 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, who lives in Thousand Oaks, said that he will recruit heavily from the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
This year's team includes sophomore catcher Frank Charles, who played at 
Montclair Prep and Sean Casey, a transfer from Santa Rosa College who graduated 
from Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of CLU: Rosa Jimenez led Cal Lutheran to the NAIA District 3 softball 
championship last season but now plays for Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez plays outfield and is the No. 2 pitcher for the Lady Raiders, who won 
the Western State Conference last season. 
</P>
<P>
Will Thurston, Moorpark's coach, said that Jimenez transferred to try to 
attract a scholarship offer from a Division I or Division II school. Jimenez 
led Cal Lutheran in five offensive categories, including batting (.336) and 
runs batted in (33). As a pitcher, she was 9-7 and posted a 2.06 earned-run 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Helping hands: Dave Salzwedel, a goalie on the Cal Lutheran soccer team, puts 
his expertise to use during the off-season as an assistant coach at Westlake 
High. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake earned a berth in the Southern Section 4-A Division soccer playoffs 
after finishing third in the Marmonte League. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching protege: Al Nordquist, coach of the Moorpark College men's basketball 
team, knows firsthand what a fierce competitor Oxnard College Coach Remy 
McCarthy can be. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy played for Nordquist at Moorpark and later became an assistant there. 
</P>
<P>
"He was probably a better coach at Moorpark than he was a player," Nordquist 
said. "He was always trying to tell me what to do, even when he was sitting on 
the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never negative with him. Remy was just always into the game, mentally." 
</P>
<P>
Under McCarthy, Oxnard leads Moorpark by a game in the Western State Conference 
standings. The rivalry between the teams has not hindered the friendship 
between coaches, however. 
</P>
<P>
Nordquist, in fact, was the one who called McCarthy when Oxnard's coaching 
position opened last year. At the time, McCarthy was coaching at Wenatchee 
(Wash.) JC. 
</P>
<P>
Said McCarthy: "Coach Nordquist, he may be the kindest man in the world. He 
stuck with me through some hard times and stayed on me about my schoolwork, 
which is why I'm here today." 
</P>
<P>
Said Nordquist: "Part of the fun of coaching are the friendships you have. I'm 
real proud of Remy."

DAVE DISTEL: IN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WEATHER, TORREY PINES SURRENDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excuse me, but I was under the impression that the Wall Street Open, or 
whatever it's called this year, was being played at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
I took a look at Thursday's scores and almost went to the Presidio par three by 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
I know Torrey Pines is not PGA West or Pebble Beach, but I didn't think it 
could be taken apart like some flat, treeless layout in Albuquerque. I heard 
they had done something with 52 sand traps on the South course, but I didn't 
think they had moved them to Black's Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines seemed to have its hands up in the air. The golf course was a 
batter taking a oh-and-two pitch, a football team punting on first down or the 
Indians surrendering to Custer. A PGA course is supposed to rise up and snarl, 
not take a beating on its back. 
</P>
<P>
And this tournament, for some reason, does not even have a premier field. 
Sixteen of the top 20 money winners of a year ago took a vacation this week, 
which is difficult to explain since coming to San Diego is a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the name has gotten so twisted and convoluted that they didn't realize 
the tournament is in San Diego. Really, where is the Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Open? Tournaments are becoming as cloned as the players, and this name is about 
as geographically identifiable as the Beatrice Western or Kemper or Centel or 
Deposit Guarantee. Give me the Chattanooga Open, for heaven's sake. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless, what if all the flower and power of golf were here? What if this 
were a U.S. Open or PGA field? It would probably take a 240 to win the darn 
thing. Oral Roberts would have a better chance hitting against Orel Hershiser 
than the golf course would have against that kind of field. 
</P>
<P>
And so I headed to Torrey Pines Friday, expecting to see that the trees had 
been removed, the bunkers grassed over, fairways resculpted to run downhill 
(and probably downwind), ponds filled, the rough trimmed like a mustache and 
greens as manageable and flat as the Astrodome infield. 
</P>
<P>
I expected to find that a Charger defensive coordinator from the pre-Ron Lynn 
days had set up the course so that some kid could step off a miniature golf 
course with a purple ball and a putter and shoot 80. 
</P>
<P>
I found so many red numbers that it seemed the scoreboard needed a tourniquet . 
. . or stitches. It was obvious anyone who shot a mere par would be headed to 
the next tournament, and anyone above par should just go home. Everyone was 
going to beat the course, but someone was going to beat everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
However, what was amazing to me was that the course did not really look any 
different, which is to say easier, to me. The rough was scraggly rather than 
tough, but that's normal because of the play Torrey Pines gets from us weekend 
hackers. The work on the traps essentially lowered their lips and made them 
easier for us, but traps do not bother the pros one iota. 
</P>
<P>
Then I realized what is was. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines was not getting any help. The weather was perfect, unless a gentle 
ocean breeze could be considered intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
This tournament needs a nice rain storm or a pelting of hail or a stiff wind, 
regardless of where it comes from. Torrey Pines needs something so the weekend 
isn't a walk in the park, which is what municipal courses really are . . . 
parks with flagsticks. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, it took a three-under-par 141 to make the 36-hole cut. 
Exactly 109 players shot par or better. There were so many guys under par that 
it looked for a while as if there was not going to be room to list the guys 
over par, few that there were, on the press room summary board. Heck, 87 
players bettered par, including 12 at three under, 14 at four under, 13 at five 
under, 18 at six under and 10 at seven under before positioning got a little 
more exclusive at the top of the leader board. 
</P>
<P>
It would be an exaggeration to say that anyone still in the tournament has a 
chance to win it, but not by a lot. 
</P>
<P>
If Friday's weather becomes Saturday's weather, look out. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido's Mark O'Meara, who putters around on a back yard green the way some 
guys tinker in their garages, started to talk about Friday's weather and then 
surrendered to logic. 
</P>
<P>
"The course did play relatively easy until the wind came up," he said and then 
thought better of it. "But even then, it wasn't that hard. These were ideal 
scoring conditions." 
</P>
<P>
O'Meara was likely initially inclined to blame an afternoon breeze on the fact 
that he was two strokes behind Mark Wiebe and Steve Elkington rather than tied 
for the lead. After all, it was after the wind picked up a bit that he bogeyed 
the 18th hole on the North Course. This was a revolting turn of events because 
the 18th is a birdie hole, and a birdie would have tied him for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line was that a fellow could not afford to bogey a birdie hole when 
everyone else was tearing the course apart. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hot," O'Meara said. "That hole was playing so easy for a par five." 
</P>
<P>
But his litany of problems was like a tale so many weekend golfers have told. 
Push right. Pull left. Fat out of a trap. And . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I three-putted to top it all off," he said. "That was a little whipped cream 
on the cake. I could have been tied . . . but I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara, of course, was introducing the human element, which can lose to 
any golf course on any given day. He did not seem too concerned. Two more 
rounds were left to play, and humans were overcoming their shortcomings quite 
nicely as Torrey Pines. And O'Meara happens to be one of the better humans 
playing this game.

WILHITE'S 39 REBOUNDS SET A SECTION RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY PARENTI Avocad 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Wilhite, a 6-foot-8 senior center, set a San Diego Section rebounding 
record of 39 Friday as No. 2 Lincoln closed out its regular season with a 
105-59 victory over Hoover at Lincoln High School. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite, who also had 24 points, broke the old record of 38 set by Sweetwater's 
Michael Pitts against San Diego on Nov. 20, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"They were 39 legitimate rebounds," Lincoln Coach Ron Loneski said. "We had 
three different people keeping track. He looked at the record book earlier 
today and said, 'All I care about tonight is going out and getting rebounds.' 
And he got a ton of them." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive City Central League title for Lincoln (25-1, 
10-0). The Hornets' City Central League record during that span is 39-1. 
</P>
<P>
Bracey Simmons scored 18 points for Hoover (2-21, 1-9). 
</P>
<P>
In other City Central League games: 
</P>
<P>
San Diego 54, Christian 52 -- Free throws gave San Diego the edge in the fourth 
quarter. Clark James was six for six from the line and Milton Miller was five 
for six. James scored 18 points and Miller added 16 for San Diego (17-4, 8-2). 
Christian is now 12-11 and 4-6. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford 74, St. Augustine 51 -- Tracy Halton hit 10 of 14 from the field to 
lead visiting Crawford (16-8, 6-4) with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
City Eastern League 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma 54, Patrick Henry 53 -- The final day of the regular season began 
with the league looking at a possible five-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
Morse and Point Loma each were tied atop the league standings at 6-3 with a 
chance to win the title outright. Patrick Henry, Serra and Madison, all a game 
behind the leaders at 5-4, played in hopes of gaining a rare five-way tie. 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma held off a furious Patrick Henry rally in the final minute to clinch 
the title at Point Loma High. Over at Morse, Serra did its part while searching 
for a co-title, knocking off Morse, 70-62. 
</P>
<P>
Madison tied Serra and Morse for second at 6-4 with a 98-70 victory over Mira 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Henry (16-10, 6-4) led for most of the game. With just over a minute to 
play, Point Loma's Beau Pack made a three-pointer, and Rob Quintana made one of 
two free throws to to give Point Loma (16-10, 7-3) a six-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Caesar then made a three-pointer for Patrick Henry, Bart Brandenburg made 
a jumper in the lane, Jason Lonsdale stole a pass and Patrick Henry called 
timeout with 7 seconds. Terence Hamilton missed from a step behind the free 
throw line, and Brandenburg's follow-up missed. 
</P>
<P>
Serra 70, Morse 62 -- Jermaine Jordan and Conrad Jones, a pair of quick 
5-foot-9 guards, controlled the game for Serra (14-9, 6-4) by combining for 35 
points and consistently beating the Morse press. 
</P>
<P>
Jones (16 points) did his damage mostly from the free throw line, making 11 of 
12, six of six in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who scored 19 points and made seven of 12 free throws, was more 
damaging when he wasn't scoring. He had five steals, five rebounds and 
exhibited an uncanny ability to find the open player under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Serra took a 34-27 halftime lead and increased it to 41-29 2 minutes into the 
third quarter. It maintained that 10-point advantage for most of the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
In the final 2 minutes, the pressure began to rattle the Conquistadors. 
Leading, 64-54, with 1:58 to play, Morse's Jimmie Rose was fouled making a 
layup and made the free throw to close the gap to 64-57 with 1:44 left. Serra 
committed a turnover and with 1:36 to play, Darrell Lewis sank a three-pointer 
to close the margin to 64-60. Serra called timeout, then missed, and Rose set 
off on the fast break. Looking for a foul, he drove into Maurice Wade, who held 
his ground and took the charge as Rose's shot rolled off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Morse, leading the league to start the week, dropped its final two games. Serra 
has won four in a row. JEFFREY PARENTI Avocado League San Marcos 69, Ramona 63 
-- Jay Kitti scored 29 points as San Marcos (7-17, 3-11) outscored host Ramona 
(9-15, 6-8) in the second half, 49-39. Jay Kitti led San Marcos with 29 points. 
Tony Newman had 24 for Ramona. Rancho Buena Vista 68, San Pasqual 66 (OT) -- 
James Lewis scored 20 points, and Darryl Parker added 15 as Rancho Buena Vista 
(12-13, 8-6) won for the sixth time in eight games. Erik Meek led San Pasqual 
with 30. El Camino 73, Oceanside 59 -- Glenn Ankton led El Camino (20-5, 13-1) 
with 29 points. Teammate Dee Boyer had 14 rebounds. Oceanside is now, 13-9 and 
11-3 in league. City Western League Mission Bay 59, Clairemont 54 -- Jolla's 
loss to USDHS, Mission Bay, who won seven of its last eight games, ensured 
itself its first co-championship since 1985, its fourth title ever. Mission Bay 
(15-7, 7-3) was down, 31-25, at the half and by seven at the end of three 
quarters but outscored Clairemont, 21-9, in the fourth. USDHS 63, La Jolla 61 
-- Peter Ellis hit a three-pointer with 17 seconds left to clinch the victory 
for USDHS (11-10, 4-6). Ellis led USDHS with 22 points. La Jolla is 15-9, 7-3. 
Palomar League Mt. Carmel 105, San Dieguito 58 -- Jeff Hensley and Shane Knight 
each scored 19 points and Knight had 11 rebounds for Mt. Carmel (16-8, 8-4). 
San Dieguito (7-17, 1-11) led, 23-21, but then was outscored, 84-35. Fallbrook 
63, Orange Glen 52 -- Shawn Macklin scored 27 points and grabbed seven rebounds 
in Orange Glen's losing effort at home. Fallbrook, which had 10 players score, 
was led by Jorge Rodriguez (15) and Chris Miller (12) and teammates Keith 
Elston and Travis Teagle added nine apiece. Fallbrook finished the season at 
12-12 and 7-5; Orange Glen dropped to 8-16, 4-8. Metro Conference Marian 57, 
Mar Vista 46 -- Marian made 15 of 19 free throws in the fourth quarter to seal 
lthe victory. Jerry Conline had 16 points, and Teo Rosales and Richard Carreon 
had 11 apiece for host Marian (5-15, 5-9). Grossmont 2-A League Valhalla 59, 
Grossmont 45 -- Tony Clark, a 6-foot-7 junior forward, scored 36 points and had 
15 rebounds for Grossmont 2-A League champion Valhalla (17-8, 6-0). Nonleague 
Helix 66, Santana 49 -- John Pressler led visiting Helix (17-6, 6-2) with 28 
points. Girls Grossmont 2-A League Valhalla 53, Grossmont 50 -- Jeanette Best 
scored 15 points and Nicole Cremidan added 12 for Valhalla (7-16, 2-4). 
Christina Adams scored a game-high 25 for host Grossmont. City Central League 
Christian 66, San Diego 47 -- Erika Jonte led Christian with 31 points. Stacy 
Patsko had 23 rebounds for Christian (11-10, 5-5). San Diego (11-10, 5-5) and 
Christian are tied for third in the league. Our Lady of Peace 47, Crawford 35 
-- Our Lady of Peace clinched its first league title with the victory over 
Crawford at St. Augustine. Tammy Tavares and Deanna Beauparlant paced OLP with 
16 and 13 points. Beauparlant added 17 rebounds. Meme Knowles led Crawford with 
11 points. OLP (19-5, 9-1) led, 23-20, at the half, but outscored the Colts 
11-6 third quarter to pull away. City Western League Mission Bay 59, Clairemont 
25 -- Cristina Willis scored 23 points, and Bonnie Martin added 13 for Mission 
Bay (18-7, 10-0). City Eastern League Point Loma 66, Patrick Henry 40 -- Tyeast 
Brown scored 22 points, and Monica Filer added 20 as Point Loma Coach Lee 
Trepanier won his 300th game, and Point Loma (26-1, 10-0) won the City Eastern 
League championship. Sorii Epps led Patrick Henry (17-8, 9-3) with 27 points. 
Nonleague Santana 52, Helix 37 -- Rebecca Aase had 14 points and 10 rebounds, 
and Stephanie Thompson had 10 points and 14 rebounds for No. 3 Santana (21-2,

HARRIFF FINDS RHYTHM TO LEAD TORREY PINES

Bounce, bounce, shoot. 
</P>
<P>
That's all he was thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Bounce, bounce, shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Harriff, guard for top-ranked Torrey Pines, was told by a coach before 
Friday night's game with visiting Poway to concentrate on nothing but two 
bounces and the shot when he went to the free-throw line. So with 32 seconds 
remaining, and Poway's last hopes of victory riding on the possibility Harriff 
might fold under pressure, Harriff blocked out everything except bounce, 
bounce, shoot. The free throws that followed were pretty enough to be 
accompanied by Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they were accompanied by a 60-53 Torrey Pines' victory, an undefeated 
Palomar League season and media attention Harriff sees about as often as the 
Falcons (27-1, 12-0) lose. 
</P>
<P>
Harriff made two more free throws seconds later to extinguish Poway's upset 
bid. The Titans (19-4, 8-4) worked hard, making a nice run in the fourth 
quarter and pulling within four with 2:32 remaining on a layup by Adam Jones. 
</P>
<P>
But after stealing two errant Torrey Pines' passes, Poway was unable to score. 
Then Harriff made two. Then two more. That was that. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me, media star," said Courtie Miller as he walked out of the locker 
room, past Harriff and a host of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, usually the Falcons' star, was solid if unspectacular Friday, scoring 
14 points to lead Torrey Pines. Just typical. 
</P>
<P>
Harriff, in his own way, played a fairly typical game, too. He stole several 
passes, got dirty on the floor a couple of times diving for the ball and scored 
11 points, most of them timely, to boost his team heading toward the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my role," he said. "If we win games, then I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines didn't cruise through this one as easily as it has most games. 
Poway, well prepared as usual by Coach Neville Saner, pestered the Falcons 
throughout the first half with quick layups by Greg Sorrell and solid outside 
shooting by Gabby Awbrey and Jay Blankenbeckler, who finished with a game-high 
20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a 33-27 lead at halftime, the Falcons looked as if they would pull away 
quickly at the beginning of the third quarter, taking a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Poway players wiped their brows in the fourth quarter and kept gnawing 
at the Falcons' defense. A free throw by Jones pulled the Titans within two 
early in the fourth quarter. Kyle Armstrong, one of two Torrey Pines 
three-point specialists, hit one with 3:57 left to give his team a comfortable 
eight-point lead. Poway managed one more run before Harriff decided things.

SWITZER SAYS HE WARNED THOMPSON OF INVESTIGATION 
</P>

<P>
Football Coach Barry Switzer of the University of Oklahoma warned quarterback 
Charles Thompson that the FBI was investigating him for allegedly selling 
cocaine, and said he was looking out for the university's football program when 
he did so. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't worry about their investigation," Switzer was quoted as saying in 
Friday's editions of the Oklahoma City Daily Oklahoman. "I had to be more 
concerned about the OU football program. That's a hell of a note . . . for them 
to sit back and not let anyone know what's going on. I had to act on what was 
in the best interest of our program. If they had come to me and cooperated . . 
. no one ever contacted me." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer did not say where he got his information but said: "I just had a source 
that told me definitely, for a fact, that they had him, had him taped, bugged . 
. . set up. When I confronted the kid he told me the truth, cooperated totally. 
I acted on that." 
</P>
<P>
The coach suspended Thompson from the team Monday and ordered him out of the 
athletic dormitory. Thompson was arrested later Monday on a complaint of 
selling 17 grams of cocaine to an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma football program is reeling from a series of felony charges 
against five athletes -- the most recent being the charge against Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said the arrest of Thompson was premature and that it hampered 
their investigation of drug trafficking in Norman, the university city. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, however, Switzer is in no immediate trouble with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Bill Price said Thursday: "There is no federal criminal 
investigation for obstruction of justice," and, "There is no investigation of 
Barry Switzer." 
</P>
<P>
Switzer said his information "came from people I believed in, and they knew 
what they were talking about." 
</P>
<P>
David Swank, the university's interim president, said Thursday that he had no 
idea where Switzer had heard about allegations against Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Swank said that Switzer is in no immediate danger of losing the job he has held 
for 16 years but indicated that the recent problems with football players might 
have left the veteran coach on thin ice. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's arrest occurred after a month of turmoil in which one Oklahoma 
football player was arrested for allegedly wounding another in a shooting in 
the athletic dormitory, and three players were charged in the alleged rape of a 
woman in the same dorm. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Oklahoma football program was put on probation for three years 
by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. for recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time I am not going to ask for the termination of Mr. Switzer's 
contract," Swank said. "I am going to rely on the athletic director and the 
football coach to get these problems solved. Now, if they can't, we're going to 
have to look at other solutions." 
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI, Thompson went to the Norman office of lawyer Robert L. 
(Buddy) Pendarvis after Switzer had suspended him Monday and told the attorney 
he was concerned about what Switzer had told him. 
</P>
<P>
Pendarvis said that at Thompson's request, he called the player's parents and 
then called the Cleveland County district attorney's office, and was referred 
to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they do not believe Switzer intended to interfere with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Swank: "We've had a great athletic tradition at the university, and I'm 
not saying we haven't become a little lax in what we've done as a result of 
that."

NOT READY TO GIVE UP;

<P>
TUDOR IS TRYING TO COME BACK AFTER SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It might have been on his second pitch to Oakland A's slugger Jose Canseco. Or 
the third. Four months later, John Tudor still isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
What he knew beyond a doubt, however, three Oakland batters into his World 
Series start for the Dodgers, was that something was wrong, terribly wrong, 
with his left elbow. Which is why, when the first inning was over, Tudor 
summoned Dr. Frank Jobe to the Dodgers' clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor said he was in terrible pain. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give me a shot," Tudor said. "Anything to stop the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Jobe refused. And John Tudor went back to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if it had been a regular game, I would have come out," Tudor said. "But 
I was at a point where I said, 'Screw it, I've got to try and see what I can 
do.' I wanted to prove to myself I couldn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
So, with a blown-out elbow, Tudor struck out Mark McGwire of the A's. Only then 
did he admit to himself it was over. He kicked the air and strode off the 
mound, clutching his useless arm. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, it would have been just an exercise in futility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, it has become an exercise in patience for Tudor, who is here 
in spring training to attempt, at 35, a comeback from major reconstructive 
surgery on his elbow performed only days after the Dodgers won the World 
Series. That was just one of three operations Tudor underwent in the 
off-season. He had arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder and also had 
screws removed from his right leg, which he had broken almost two years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
When Tudor tossed lightly from a practice mound here Friday -- not the full 60 
feet 6 inches, but about 40 feet -- it was only the sixth or seventh time he'd 
picked up a baseball since last season. Team officials are projecting July as 
the earliest Tudor could resume pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the date in doctors' minds, but most doctors haven't been athletes," 
Tudor said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my own mind, I'm going to be ready when I'm ready. That's the best answer I 
can give. I can't put a date on it, because I don't know how it's going to 
respond. Doctors can put out a timetable, going on statistics, but somehow 
people are always able to beat statistics." 
</P>
<P>
And Tudor is no stranger to pain. This is the third straight off-season he has 
spent rehabilitating one ache or another -- a sore shoulder in 1986 and '87, 
arthroscopic knee surgery in '87. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people go through life with a lot more pain than I do," Tudor said. 
"And I get reimbursed pretty handsomely to put up with what I put up with." 
</P>
<P>
It never occurred to Tudor, a Dodger only since last Aug. 17, when he was 
acquired from St. Louis for Pedro Guerrero, to refuse the so-called Tommy John 
operation -- in which a tendon from his right forearm was removed and used to 
reconstruct the elbow -- and call it a career. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed to find out how long it was going to take for me to recover from 
it," Tudor said. "If (Jobe) told me I wasn't going to pitch for a year, then I 
may not have gone through with it. Then again, I may have. 
</P>
<P>
"But I knew I had to do it for no other reason than that I could have somewhere 
near a normal arm for the rest of my life. There's a lot of things I wouldn't 
have been able to do if I hadn't had it repaired, because there was nothing 
holding the joint together. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt me to brush my hair or wash my hair because of the pushing -- it was 
separating the joint." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor can't say for sure how he first hurt his elbow, only that it happened 
last spring, when he was working his way back from an operation on his 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I may have tried to get ready too fast," he said. "I really don't know 
if I hurt it overcompensating for my shoulder or if I hurt it swinging (a bat), 
because that's when it really hurt the most." 
</P>
<P>
Tudor didn't miss any starts for St. Louis last season, but the elbow hurt off 
and on. He went about 10 or 12 outings until it bothered him so much that he 
had a cortisone shot, then he went three more starts before having another 
shot. For the next several starts, the pain was gone. When he awoke the day 
after his last outing for the Cardinals, a 1-0 win over Philadelphia, the pain 
had returned. Three days later, he was traded to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Cardinals know he was damaged goods when they swapped him for Guerrero? 
</P>
<P>
"As far as they were concerned, my days were probably numbered, but as far as 
they knew, I didn't have any problems at the time. The trainer probably knew, 
but when I complain about a sore arm, it's like, 'What's new? Today's Tuesday, 
why shouldn't it be sore?' " 
</P>
<P>
It became a running joke that when Tudor said he had a sore arm, his teammates 
told him he would have a good game. But Tudor wasn't laughing two innings into 
his first start for the Dodgers, when his elbow began to ache again. He made 
nine starts for the Dodgers, going 4-3 with a 2.41 earned-run average, but 
lasted just 1 1/3 innings in his last start Sept. 30 against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
He gritted his way through five innings of Game 4 of the playoffs against the 
Mets, but then four batters into Game 3 of the Series, his season was over. 
</P>
<P>
"They kept telling me it was tendinitis or this or that," Tudor said. "But when 
Dr. Jobe went in there, he told me it looked like (the ligament) had been torn 
two or three times. Partially torn probably, then completely torn that last 
game." 
</P>
<P>
It had been tough enough for Tudor to be torn away from the Cardinals, a team 
he had pitched into the World Series twice in 3 1/2 seasons. He had become a 
Dodger only reluctantly and had hinted that perhaps he would not remain one for 
long. The trade, however, did not come as a total shock. The Cardinals' zeal in 
signing him to a new contract last summer -- as opposed to waiting until the 
end of the season, as with other players -- tipped off Tudor that he might be 
headed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
When Tudor didn't join his new teammates to celebrate winning the National 
League Western Division title last September, some saw that as a barometer of 
his alienation. That was hardly the case, he says now. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't think it was right," he said. "Maybe I was wrong, the way I felt 
at the time, but I wasn't trying to be disrespectful. I was just showing them 
the respect they deserved from me. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been here, and they would have won without me. I said at the time 
that I planned to play a bigger role from then on, but unfortunately, it didn't 
work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
It was unfortunate, too, that the injury deprived Tudor of an oppurtunity to 
vindicate himself for the two biggest defeats of his career -- the Game 7 loss 
to Kansas City in the 1985 World Series, after which he punched an electric fan 
and cut his hand, and a Game 6 loss to the Minnesota Twins in the '87 Series, 
which the Twins then won in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
He had three other Series wins, but they were eclipsed by those losses. The 
memory of those games, he said, may have caused him to attempt to last longer 
than he should have against the A's. 
</P>
<P>
Any ambivalence he might have had about being a Dodger has long since 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this ballclub," he said. "I like the makeup, the psyche of this team. 
They really showed me a lot last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't have to show me anything, but they showed me a lot. They played 
with a lot of heart, a lot of guts. It was really a fun team to be around. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed playing in St. Louis, with the guys there, and by no means am I 
trying to rap them, but (the Cardinals) never played with the kind of intensity 
this team played with. . . . This team heard so much about the things they 
couldn't do, they just decided, 'We can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And with a similar attitude, Tudor plots his return to pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd just as soon be ready right now, but I'm trying the best I can to take it 
in stride," he said. "When my arm tells me I can't do it anymore, I'll back 
off, but until then, I'll keep stepping forward." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Valenzuela, who is coming back from shoulder problems, pitched from a 
practice mound. "My arm feels strong," he said. "No pain. A little tired, but 
my arm feels strong." Valenzuela even threw a couple of screwballs, "Good 
rotation," he said with a big smile. . .The Dodgers signed infielder Tracy 
Woodson and outfielder Jose Gonzalez to one-year contracts.

INTERNATIONAL RACE OF CHAMPIONS; 
</P>
<P>
WALLACE, STARTING 12TH AND LAST, ENDS UP FIRST

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 50th International Race of Champions turned out to be one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
In a series noted for few lead changes, Friday's opening round of IROC XIII 
turned into a bonanza of passes. The 12 identically-prepared Easter egg-colored 
Camaros exchanged positions so often that they turned Daytona International 
Speedway into a moving rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, half of the drivers in the field led at least a lap, but there were 
many more lead swaps in mid-lap among the NASCAR, Indy car and sports car 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Rusty Wallace, a Winston Cup driver making his IROC debut, came from 12th to 
win, the first time in 50 races that feat has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew if I was going to have any kind of chance, I had to make a strong move 
on the first lap," Wallace said. "Down the backstretch, everybody got strung 
out, and I saw a hole at the top and never lifted. I went right through and had 
a lot of momentum going through Turn 4. When we came by the starting line I was 
third or fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Petty, making his first IROC start in 12 years, had taken the lead from 
pole-sitter Rick Mears on the second lap but gave way to Dale Earnhardt on the 
sixth time around the 2.5-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
For the last half of the race it looked like a tag-team match, with Earnhardt 
and Wallace, two old NASCAR buddies, hooking up against fellow stock car driver 
Terry Labonte and defending IROC champion Al Unser Jr., from the Indy car 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passing was done in tandem as the four swapped positions nearly 
every time around. 
</P>
<P>
With two laps to go, Wallace had the lead, followed by Labonte, Earnhardt and 
Unser. Surprisingly, after so many changes, there was no passing on the final 
two laps as the cars charged around the track in single file. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't get at the right place at the right time on the last lap," 
Earnhardt said. "We just sort of had to hang out at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said he prevented last-lap passes by first darting down low to cut off 
Labonte's momentum and then shifting up high to cut off Earnhardt's charge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something you'd try on Interstate 95 (the road from Daytona Beach to 
Miami)," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace and other drivers credited IROC President Jay Signore for making the 
cars competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay put some tabs on the fenders so that it would feel like the cars are wider 
and they would be easier to draft," Wallace said. "Drafting is different than 
it once was. It's not like the old notchback days, when you could dart out and 
go around another guy. When they dart (from behind) you dart in front and block 
them now." 
</P>
<P>
In the previous 49 IROC races, 14 had no lead changes and 12 more had only one. 
</P>
<P>
Winston Cup champion Bill Elliott, recovering from a broken wrist, drove the 
entire 40 laps with one hand -- his right -- and moved as high as second place 
early in the race before dropping back and finishing fifth. Last year, Elliott 
led every lap in the Daytona IROC. 
</P>
<P>
"My wrist is really hurting," Elliott said. "I know I won't drive any farther 
Sunday than I have to. If it weren't for the wrist, I think I could have been 
up with those four at the end. I got hung out one time, and that was about it." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott plans to start Sunday's Daytona 500 and then turn his Ford Thunderbird 
over to relief driver Jody Ridley at the first pit stop. Ridley drove the car 
in Thursday's 125-mile qualifying race. 
</P>
<P>
The second IROC race will be run April 29 at Nazareth, Pa., a one-mile oval. 
Drivers start in inverted order from their Daytona finish so Wallace will start 
last again. 
</P>
<P>
Indy car champion Danny Sullivan, the only driver who was lapped, will start 
from the pole at Nazareth -- a track in which he shares ownership with Indy car 
owner Roger Penske.

Although Adrian Dantley missed a contractual reporting deadline, the Dallas 
Mavericks notified the National Basketball Assn. that they have waived their 
right to negate a trade with the Detroit Pistons involving Mark Aguirre for 
Dantley. 
</P>
<P>
The notification means Aguirre, who was traded to Detroit Wednesday, will be 
able to play for Detroit tonight at Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
Dantley's wife, mother and agent, David Faulk, assured Maverick officials that 
Dantley planned to join the team, probably next week. All three said Dantley 
needed time to adjust to the trade.

Three Georgia Tech football players, who were arrested after a female student 
was beaten at a restaurant, have been placed on indefinite suspension by Coach 
Bobby Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Offensive lineman Mike Mooney, reserve guard Jim Lavin and reserve linebacker 
Kevin Salisbury cannot play under their current status, but they will be 
allowed at spring practice and could be reinstated before the football season 
begins, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Salisbury will not be disciplined by the school until his court case is 
settled. He faces aggravated battery charges in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Salisbury and Mooney assaulted Lisa Steffee at a 
pizza restaurant near campus Jan. 18, breaking her nose and detaching part of a 
nostril. Salisbury faces three counts of simple battery, disorderly conduct and 
criminal property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Mooney has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and obstructing an officer;

DOWNEY MAN PICKS 7 WINNERS AT SANTA ANITA FOR $388,289 PAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several longshot winners spoiled the chances of many Pick Nine players at Santa 
Anita Friday, but a Downey man who correctly handicapped seven of the nine 
races on a $128 ticket went away with a $388,289 payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Dallmeier had four of the five winning combinations of seven horses, and 
each combination was worth $92,452.60. He also won several consolation payoffs, 
bringing the total return on his wagers to $390,775. The person holding the 
remaining ticket with seven winners did not cash it Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The $501,187 carryover after Thursday's racing program forced a mandatory 
payout Friday. That lured 37,949 fans to the track and 8,259 to inter-track 
wagering sites Friday, when $511,999 was wagered on the Pick Nine. Because no 
one had all nine winners, which would have required a full payout of the net 
pool, $250,000 was reserved in the carryover for today. 
</P>
<P>
Dallmeier selected the winners of all but the fifth and ninth races on his 
ticket, using no more than two horses in any race and single picks in the 
fourth, seventh and eighth races. He missed on two picks in the fifth and two 
in the ninth, leaving him with four different combinations of seven winners. 
</P>
<P>
Dallmeier was certain he was in good shape to cash a big ticket after his lone 
pick in the seventh race, $49.80 longshot Belle Poitrine, came in. He also had 
the $13.80 winner of the second race, Bettor Roger; the $19.20 winner of the 
sixth, Sassy Slew, and the $12.20 winner of the eighth, Illumineux. 
</P>
<P>
"I handicapped for about two hours at a restaurant Friday morning," said 
Dallmeier, who admitted having difficulty finding a copy of the Daily Racing 
Form because of interest in the Pick Nine. "I picked the horses, but as I 
watched the races, I realized my longshots were all ridden by top jockeys -- 
Patrick Valenzuela, Eddie Delahoussaye and Gary Stevens. That didn't hurt my 
chances. But mainly it was just 30 years of handicapping experience coming 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Dallmeier recently left his job with Rockwell International to go into 
multilevel marketing, or he would have been working Friday and probably would 
have missed his big day at the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live at the track for about 20 years, but I haven't been coming much 
lately," he said. "This is only the third time this season. I just came for the 
Pick Nine. I didn't come for the free wallets (being given away with each 
Friday admission)." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his big score in the Pick Nine, Dallmeier used essentially the 
same horses to win three Pick Six payoffs of $4,709.20 each and a Daily Triple 
worth $8,322.60 on a $6 bet.

STEINBRENNER IN LINE TO BE A VICE PRESIDENT OF USOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As he is virtually everywhere he goes, New York Yankees owner George 
Steinbrenner will be the center of attention at this weekend's meetings of the 
U.S. Olympic Committee House of Delegates and executive board. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, who has been active in the USOC in recent years as a 
private-sector member of the executive board, is expected to be elected today 
as one of three USOC vice presidents by the House of Delegates . 
</P>
<P>
More suspense surrounds his report Sunday to the executive board on behalf of 
the Olympic Overview Commission, of which he was chairman. The eight-member 
commission has met 14 times since it was was formed last February by USOC 
President Robert Helmick to evaluate the U.S. Olympic effort. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission members agreed not to discuss publicly their 
recommendations until the report is delivered, their efforts are believed to 
have centered around methods of streamlining the USOC's administration, 
improving its marketing capabilities and making more money available to 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, it is believed that the commission will suggest a relocation of 
some staff members, particularly in the areas of marketing and public 
relations, from USOC headquarters in Colorado Springs to New York, and the 
establishment of a government liaison office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Among the observers will be Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the 
International Olympic Committee, who visited Atlanta Wednesday to discuss that 
city's bid for the 1996 Summer Games and met with President Bush Thursday in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Helmick, a Des Moines attorney, has no opposition in his bid to remain as USOC 
president for the next four years. But three vice presidents will be chosen 
from among four candidates -- Steinbrenner, Los Angeles attorney Michael 
Lenard, Colorado Springs businessman William Tutt and five-time track and field 
Olympian Willye White of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The candidate for treasurer, Dr. LeRoy Walker of Durham, N.C., and the 
candidate for secretary, Charles Foster of Duxbury, Mass., are unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, the executive board is expected to approve the largest 
budget in USOC history for the next four years, $248.8 million, which is almost 
$100 million more than the budget for the previous four years, and to ratify a 
proposed drug-testing agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union.

IT TAKES TIME, BUT PEPPERDINE DEFEATS GONZAGA; 
</P>

WAVES EVENTUALLY SURVIVE SLOWDOWN TACTICS TO TIE ST. MARY'S FOR WCAC LEAD

Snarled traffic on Pacific Coast Highway Friday night caused a half-hour delay 
in the start of the Gonzaga-Pepperdine basketball game at Firestone Fieldhouse 
in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a tanker trailer that overturned on the San Diego Freeway Friday 
afternoon, resulting in the closure of all northbound lanes, Gonzaga was caught 
in traffic for two hours while trying to get to the game. 
</P>
<P>
When the game finally began before a crowd of 2,098, both teams had trouble 
getting started. Neither squad shot well -- or often -- against zone defenses 
that clogged the lanes, bogging down both offenses. 
</P>
<P>
The game's tempo, a slow crawl, suited the Bulldogs, who led throughout most of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Pepperdine that finally inched its way to a 69-66 victory and pulled 
back into a tie for first place with idle St. Mary's in the West Coast Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves improved to 17-9 overall and 9-2 in the conference. Gonzaga fell to 
13-11 and 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs couldn't dictate the time of their arrival, but they controlled 
the tempo of the game from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine had trouble getting open shots -- and more trouble making them when 
players got open. The Waves shot 28.6% in the first half, and Tom Lewis was 1 
for 10 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bulldogs went 40% on 10-of-25 shooting and made 11 of 12 foul 
shots en route to a a 31-26 halftime advantage., 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga stayed ahead until Lewis, who finished with 13 points, made two free 
throws to give Pepperdine its first lead of the second half at 49-48 with 7:43 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands twice more and the score was tied several more times 
before Craig Davis started unsnarling things with 3-point baskets. Davis, who 
always seems to play well against Gonzaga, hit four three-pointers in the 
second half on the way to a team-high 17 points. He had only four points in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' fourth three-pointer came with 54 seconds remaining and gave the Waves a 
66-63 lead. But it wasn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga kept clawing back, and it took three free throws by Rick Welch in the 
last 10 seconds to pull it out for Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Pepperdine players scored in double figures. Dexter Howard had 15 
points, Marty Wilson 11 and Casey Crawford 10. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Franklin led Gonzaga with 19 points; Doug Spradley had 16 (including three 
3-pointers), and Jim McPhee added 13. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, which has beaten Gonzaga four straight times, is 18-5 against the 
Bulldogs, 18-4 in WCAC games.

KIMBLE RETURNS, SCORES 29 TO LEAD LOYOLA, 144-92 
</P>

<P>
Bo Kimble made a successful return to the Loyola Marymount starting lineup 
Friday night, and the Lions marked the occasion by breaking three conference 
scoring records with a 144-92 victory over Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's total set a record for West Coast Athletic Conference games, as did 
the Lions' 54 field goals and 13 three-pointers. The output enabled the Lions 
(15-9 overall) to stay within one game of first in the WCAC at 8-3. Portland 
fell to 2-22 and 2-9. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Gathers paced Loyola with 32 points and 9 rebounds. Jeff Fryer added 23 
points, including five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lion Coach Paul Westhead was happiest to see the return to form of 
Kimble, the 6-foot 5-inch junior guard who has been recovering from 
arthroscopic knee surgery. Making his first start since Dec. 1, Kimble scored a 
season-high 29 points in 26 minutes, hitting all three three-point attempts and 
grabbing nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we timed (his return) just right," Westhead said. "We eased him in 
a few games, and now we've got three or four games to start him. His physical 
timing is back, his shot's going, his cutting is much better." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola shot a season-high 67.4% and hit 13 of 23 three-pointers. Portland 
played without leading scorer Josh Lowery, who was suspended earlier this week 
after an off-campus fight. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman guard Eric Spoelstra led the Pilots with 17 points. The Lions play 
host to Gonzaga in their last home game tonight.

TRADE DEFICIT SHRINKS IN 1988; IMPROVEMENT IN DECEMBER SLIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's foreign trade deficit shrank to $137.3 billion in 1988 -- $33 billion 
less than in the previous year, the Commerce Department reported Friday. But 
the imbalance narrowed only slightly in December, apparently confirming that 
further improvement is apt to be slow. 
</P>
<P>
The figure for 1988, down from a record $170.3-billion deficit posted in 1987, 
marked the first time that the yearly deficit has declined since 1980. The 
improvement has resulted from a fall in the value of the dollar, which makes 
U.S. goods more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
But the department's monthly report for December showed that imports continued 
to exceed exports by $11.9 billion -- barely $300 million below November's 
level -- despite a respectable increase in exports, which soared $1.65 billion, 
or 0.6%, to a record $29.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Demand for Imports 
</P>
<P>
Import buying by Americans climbed by $1.3 billion, or 0.3%, in December, 
partly because of a rise in oil prices. The deficit has remained on a plateau 
now for more than five months, following visibly more dramatic gains during the 
early part of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration hailed the reduction in the trade deficit for 1988 as 
"good news" for the economy. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that 
the trade picture is continuing to show "a trend of improvement." 
</P>
<P>
But that may be nearing an end, as continued strong demand for imports here at 
home -- combined with the inability of some export industries to increase their 
production using their existing plant facilities -- constrains the pace of 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Also expected to be a factor is the recent rise in oil prices, which is likely 
to bloat the nation's oil import bill by as much as $4 billion over the year. 
Economists said that some of that already is evident in the December figures. 
</P>
<P>
Internal government estimates show that the trade balance is likely to dip only 
modestly this year, possibly to $125 billion or so for the year as a whole, 
from the $137.3 billion recorded in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Private analysts warned that if the trade deficit does not begin to shrink more 
rapidly, the United States could be faced with the choice of allowing the 
dollar to fall further -- at the risk of exacerbating inflation -- or of 
slowing the economy to help dampen import buying. 
</P>
<P>
David Levine, economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said that he 
believes the trade picture will continue to show gradual improvement for two or 
three more quarters "even if the dollar doesn't drop further." But he said that 
the improvement "will pretty much end in late 1989." 
</P>
<P>
And Lawrence Chimerine, economist for Wharton EFTA in Philadelphia, said that 
he expects to see "one or both eventually" -- either further downward pressure 
on the dollar or slower domestic demand, adding: "The trade problem is going to 
be with us for a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Surprises 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board already has begun to nudge interest rates higher, in 
part to slow the economy and to keep the dollar from falling too far. But 
President Bush appears to have rejected any slower-growth strategy. Some 
analysts fear that there may be a clash between the two. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets echoed similar sentiments. Although the stock market surged 
ahead Friday despite the trade report, the dollar declined slightly on foreign 
exchange markets and traders still were apprehensive that the Fed might move to 
nudge interest rates still higher. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the figures were generally in line with what the markets had expected. 
</P>
<P>
The $11.9-billion deficit for December was calculated on the traditional basis. 
A new measure of the trade gap that the department will adopt next month to 
replace the current system showed the December deficit at $10.2 billion, down 
from $10.7 billion in November. 
</P>
<P>
The new compilation, similar to the statistics-gathering procedures used by 
most other countries, showed the deficit for 1988 at $118.7 billion, down from 
$152.1 billion in 1987. The calculations do not count insurance and freight 
charges that have been incurred abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The December report highlighted several new developments in the nation's trade 
patterns: 
</P>
<P>
* Imports of capital goods, often cited as a sign that U.S. industries are 
beginning to expand their overall production capacity, appeared to peak out in 
December, and thus are less likely to bloat overall import levels in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
* Exports of consumer goods continued to expand, a reflection of the cheaper 
dollar, which makes U.S. products more attractive overseas. And agricultural 
exports remained relatively weak, partly because of flooding and transportation 
problems in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The figures for the year reflected substantial improvement in the United 
States' trade balance with virtually all its major trading partners: 
</P>
<P>
* The U.S. trade deficit with Japan shrank to $55.4 billion in 1988, compared 
to $59.8 billion in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
* The deficit with Western Europe fell to $12.8 billion, from $24.3 billion in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
* The deficit with Canada dipped to $10.6 billion, from $11.7 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* With the newly industrial economies such as Taiwan and South Korea, the 
deficit fell to $31.6 billion, from $37.7 billion in 1987.

LEGALITY OF 'HUMAN BUGS' IN CHICAGO STING QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal investigation of alleged fraud at Chicago's two major commodities 
exchanges may result in a precedent-setting court battle over the government's 
right to use "human bugs" in undercover sting operations, attorneys who have 
been retained by some of the traders said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the government can legally record "ambient conversation" 
without a court order, said commodities lawyer and former federal prosecutor 
Stephen J. Senderowitz. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue that has never really been decided in court," Senderowitz 
told a standing-room-only meeting of the Chicago Bar Assn.'s futures 
regulations law committee. "Evidence that has been gathered as a result of 
violations of the (federal) eavesdropping statutes taints anything it comes in 
contact with." 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, criminal lawyer Edward Genson disclosed new details about 
how government agents operated to gather evidence in the undercover FBI 
investigation of trading practices at the Chicago Board of Trade and the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two largest commodities futures 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
Agents, posing as traders, worked on the exchange floors for almost two years 
wearing concealed recording devices to collect evidence of wrongdoing by 
traders and brokers. 
</P>
<P>
In the coordinated twin investigations of the Board of Trade and the Mercantile 
Exchange, government agents did not have prior court approval to tape record 
conversations on the trading floor and in the trading pits. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law allows a government agent to wear a concealed recording device to 
tape a conversation with a targeted suspect in an investigation without a court 
order. But, Senderowitz said, to make recordings in a room with a concealed 
recording device, the government must get the OK from a federal judge to plant 
the bug. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, you have a situation involving a private exchange," Senderowitz 
said. "The public is not entitled to be on (the trading) floor. If they get on 
the floor, they go through security checkpoints with a guest badge and they 
can't even get into the pits. The FBI agents got into the pit through a ruse. 
And once in the pit, without any identifiable target, they acted as roving bugs 
in our opinion. In fact, they acted like a planted microphone." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that the type of overhear that needs judicial approval, or is it the type 
that does not need judicial approval?" That, Senderowitz said, is the question. 
</P>
<P>
Senderowitz did not refer to any specific cases in his remarks and refused to 
respond to questions from reporters about whether any challenges have been 
filed in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
25 Interviews 
</P>
<P>
However, other legal sources said a challenge of the government's case based on 
improper use of "human bugs" would probably have to be decided by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in a precedent-setting decision. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Genson disclosed that an FBI undercover agent who traded at the 
Mercantile Exchange and used the name Peter William Vogel ended most trading 
days with "some sort of disparity" in his trading account. In some instances, 
he volunteered to "eat" losses to ingratiate himself to brokers. In other 
cases, he agreed to apparently illegal schemes to wipe out losses. 
</P>
<P>
Genson said his investigation, based on 25 interviews with traders and brokers, 
revealed that Vogel asked "brokers to launder money through some sort of ruse. 
A lot of people turned that down." 
</P>
<P>
Senderowitz, who prosecuted commodities crimes when he worked for the Justice 
Department in Chicago, said that if the investigation were focusing on 
relatively common trading infractions, there would be no need for an undercover 
investigation. Information on those activities could be obtained from the 
exchanges' internal disciplinary reports. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Humor in Yen Pit 
</P>
<P>
"I think some of the more dastardly things reported may have been the main 
thrust of the investigation," Senderowitz said. "I think it remains to be seen 
whether money laundering and tax fraud are ultimately the subject of 
indictments." 
</P>
<P>
The undercover investigation, which has kept Chicago's best legal minds busy 
since it first surfaced a month ago, has spawned both fear and paranoia on the 
trading floors of the exchanges but has also resulted in some black humor. 
</P>
<P>
This week, traders in the Mercantile Exchange's yen pit -- a focus of the 
federal probe -- were seen wearing little white lapel buttons to indicate they 
were not carrying concealed tape recorders. The buttons showed a microphone 
crossed out by a red slash.

WESTWOOD SAVINGS AMONG 25 S&amp;LS TAKEN OVER BY REGULATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal banking regulators Friday took over 25 more insolvent savings and loans 
across the country, including Westwood Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles, a 
thrift in trouble for several years because of real estate loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
The seizures were made by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and bring to 36 
the number of insolvent thrifts placed in government conservatorship during the 
past two weeks. President Bush has ordered the FDIC, which insures deposits at 
commercial banks, to take over more than 200 insolvent thrifts within the next 
six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, the seizures temporarily nationalize the insolvent thrifts and seek 
to stabilize their financial condition until regulators decide what to do with 
them. The moves are part of the Bush Administration's effort to clean up thrift 
industry failures, a task that is expected to cost at least $90 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three former thrift executives in Texas were indicted for their role 
in an alleged $1-million fraud, the Justice Department announced. The 
allegations included misapplication of funds and a conspiracy to defraud 
federal thrift regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment was the result of investigations by a federal criminal task 
force probing fraud in that state's thrift industry. Named in the indictment 
were E. Morten Hopkins, Woodrow Brownlee and John Harrell. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC said its action will not disrupt normal operations of the 25 thrifts, 
which are in 14 states. The thrifts "will maintain normal operations, and all 
depositors will continue to be protected up to the $100,000 insurance limit," 
according to a statement from the government agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scattered Across U.S. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest institution taken over was Southwest Savings &amp; Loan in Phoenix, 
which has $2.42 billion in assets. The smallest was Nile Valley Federal Savings 
&amp; Loan in Scottsbluff, Neb., which had $62.3 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
In all, five thrifts were in Nebraska, three in Arizona, two each in Florida, 
Kansas, Louisiana, New Jersey and Utah, and one each in Alabama, Arkansas, 
California, Connecticut, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin. They have total 
assets of $12.7 billion and total deposits of $11.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In Westwood Savings' case, the action amounted to a transfer of supervision 
from one government agency to another. Westwood Savings had been under a 
conservatorship of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the insurance 
agency for S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's business as usual for depositors, customers and employees," said Carol 
Schatz, an FSLIC spokeswoman. "This is an administrative change." 
</P>
<P>
Westwood Savings is the successor institution to California Women's Savings 
&amp; Loan, which was founded in 1978 to help women obtain credit and other 
financial services. The thrift was bought in the early 1980s by real estate 
developer Edward M. Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, it was revealed that fast-growing Westwood Savings was in an "unsafe 
and unsound" condition because it had lent heavily to troubled commercial and 
residential real estate projects managed by Dallas entrepreneur Craig Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negative Net Worth 
</P>
<P>
The FSLIC placed the firm in receivership on March 27, 1986, and later sued 
several former officers, including Israel, charging them with engaging in 
improper lending practices. Since then, the insolvent financial institution has 
maintained a low profile while gradually shrinking its assets from $554 million 
to its present level of $342 million. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood Savings has a negative net worth of $216 million, meaning that its 
debts exceed its assets by that amount. With five branch offices in the Los 
Angeles area and 9,065 customer accounts, the thrift has total deposits of $414 
million. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment in Texas, Brownlee, Hopkins and Harrell are accused 
of participating in a phony land deal aimed at diverting $1 million from 
Commodore Savings Assn. to one of its affiliates, National Mortgage Corp. of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Brownlee and Harrell were both officials of Commodore Savings while Hopkins was 
president of National Mortgage. Commodore Savings, which became insolvent, was 
recently merged and renamed Consolidated Federal Bank.

EASY CREDIT BY AUTO MAKERS CITED AS LOAN DEFAULTS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Easy consumer credit, which helped car dealers move more than 7 million 
vehicles out of their showrooms last year, has led to a sharp increase in 
defaults on loans for new cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors disclosed figures this week indicating that 
more consumers are having trouble repaying their car loans in the wake of 
aggressive new car buyer financing programs that offered loans of five years or 
longer and required little or no credit history or down payment. 
</P>
<P>
California may be especially prone to defaults because it is the nation's 
largest car market and because high car insurance rates here make it difficult 
for residents to afford personal transportation, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Defaults seem to be hitting mostly the domestic auto makers, which all have 
subsidiaries that provide new car loans. But Chrysler says it has fewer 
problems with defaults on car loans because it has not relaxed its standards to 
make more sales. Commercial banks and credit unions also say they have not been 
hit as hard by the default problem. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, which announced record profits Thursday, said earnings from its financial 
service company, Ford Motor Credit Co., last year fell $115 million to $564 
million because of higher credit losses. 
</P>
<P>
GM, meanwhile, says it repossessed more than 143,000 cars and trucks last year, 
a 23% increase from a year earlier. The car maker also set aside more than $1 
billion in 1988 to cover automotive loan losses, about double its loan-loss 
reserve of 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than two-thirds of GM and Ford car loans are for five years or 
more, while less than half the car loans originated by commercial banks are 
longer than 48 months. 
</P>
<P>
"Credit losses are throughout the industry, and I think it's mostly due to the 
five- and six-year loans," said William E. Odom, chairman of Ford Motor Credit 
Co. "On a five-year loan it takes 37 months before the customer owes less than 
what the car is worth. It's 25 months on a four-year loan." 
</P>
<P>
GM and Ford say defaults make up only about 2% of all new cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
"Loan losses have to be put in perspective," said Ronald Glantz, an auto 
analyst for Montgomery Securities investment house in San Francisco. "It's 
traditional for these finance company subsidiaries (of Ford and GM) to be the 
lender of last resort." And in some cases, Glantz said, they are making loans 
to marginal buyers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bank Pulling Out 
</P>
<P>
The heated competition to relax loan standards has given some lenders pause, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
In November, First Interstate Bank announced that it would phase out its 
practice of offering car loans through auto dealers because competition from 
finance companies associated with big auto makers made the business 
unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a whole different credit criteria than the captive finance 
companies," said Derrald K. Johnson, a vice president at Bank of America, the 
leading commercial bank lender for new car loans. "Their motive is to sell the 
car; our motive is to make a good loan." 
</P>
<P>
The longer installments aren't necessarily bargains for consumers, he said. 
Although monthly payments on a $20,000 five-year car loan at 11.5% simple 
interest would be $219.60 less than a three-year loan, Johnson said the 
borrower would end up paying $2,651.04 more. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many borrowers seem to prefer lower monthly payments and longer terms. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Federal Credit Union in Burbank reports strong demand for car loans it 
offers for terms of up to six years and few problems with defaults. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Tagami-Reeves, marketing manager, said that despite the longer repayment 
periods, default rates are low in part because some 38% of the 71,000 credit 
union members choose to repay their loans through payroll deductions. 
</P>
<P>
"We loan money not based on collateral but on members' ability to pay us back," 
she said.

ZAUSNER FOODS AGREES TO BUY ALTA-DENA; 
</P>
<P>
STUEVE FAMILY WILL KEEP ITS NATURAL LINE, 6 DAIRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executives at Alta-Dena Certified Dairy Inc., one of the largest family-owned 
dairy companies in the United States, have agreed to sell the firm to Zausner 
Foods, an American subsidiary of Bongrain S.A. of France. 
</P>
<P>
Alta-Dena, owned by the Stueve family and headquartered in City of Industry, 
did not release the financial details of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Alta-Dena Chairman Harold Stueve said Friday that competitive pressures and his 
age -- he's 71 -- contributed to the decision to sell the 44-year-old company. 
Stueve said he will stay on as a consultant. No layoffs and no major management 
changes are planned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's brands of pasteurized milk products -- processed and distributed 
by about 700 employees at facilities in Tustin, San Diego, Highland, Chatsworth 
and Hawthorne -- will be sold by Zausner under the Alta-Dena name, according to 
the two firms. Zausner will acquire Alta-Dena's milk, ice cream, cultured 
products and hard cheeses under the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
However, the deal does not include Alta-Dena's six dairy farms or Stueve 
Natural raw-milk products. The state has named these products in some past 
recall orders after some batches showed traces of salmonella bacteria. The 
company has maintained that no one has suffered any ill effects from drinking 
the company's raw milk. 
</P>
<P>
Stueve said the company decided to sell its pasteurized products partly because 
the family wanted to concentrate on the Natural line. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 employees work in the Stueve Natural operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting too old, and I wanted to disburse it (the company)," he said. "I 
feel by consolidating, we can save money and not lower the quality. They 
(Zausner) feel the same way about quality." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Advantage' 
</P>
<P>
Stueve also said the company decided to sell its pasteurized operation because 
of competitive pressures. Stueve characterized the company's 1988 revenue -- 
$126 million -- as large but said profit margins were thin. He said Zausner 
would distribute the Alta-Dena line more heavily. "We're shipping to every 
state in the union and there's a high freight cost," he said. "The price (of 
dairy goods) is so low. The consumer has a big advantage in California. It's 
very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The prospective new owners of Alta-Dena, based in Newhall, Penn., own the 
Colombo Yogurt, Penguin Yogurt, Real Fresh Inc., Alouette Brand Cream Cheese, 
Kolb Lena and Major Smith labels. Bongrain, its parent, reported 1988 revenue 
of about $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Larger dairy processors are faring better than smaller independent operations, 
according to Fred Douma, counsel for the Ontario-based Western United Dairymen. 
Douma said the three largest dairy processors in Southern California are owned 
by grocery store chains. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the advantage of the economy and efficiency of size," he said. "You 
can produce on a cheaper basis by maximizing capacity."

Airline flight delays in 1988 at U.S. airports dropped to the lowest level in 
three years, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The FAA said delays of 
15 minutes or more totaled 337,661 in 1988, down from 355,718 delays in 1987 
and 417,644 in 1986. Weather and heavy traffic were the main causes of the 
delays. The major airports that reported dramatic reductions in delays were: 
Los Angeles International (-68.9%), Boston Logan (-40.5%), Atlanta Hartsfield 
(-39.6%), Washington National (-44.2%) and New York's John F. Kennedy (-19.6%).

The three national television networks have asked for several changes to the 
provocative Diet Coke ad that claims consumers are switching from regular Pepsi 
to Diet Coke. But the ads will continue to run, Coca-Cola U.S.A. executives 
said. The ad will now specifically note that while 2 million families stopped 
buying regular Pepsi last year, "about a half million of them moved to Diet 
Coke." And the ad will also note the source of the ad's claim -- 
Connecticut-based Marketing Research Corp. of America.

KNIGHT-RIDDER HAS BIDDERS FOR ITS TV STATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
EXPECTS 8 PROPERTIES TO PULL TOTAL OF $400 MILLION

Knight-Ridder Inc. said Friday that it is negotiating with several companies on 
its previously disclosed plans to sell its eight television stations and 
expects to get an aggregate price of more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Miami-based media firm announced its plan to sell all of the stations Oct. 
6 but had not said how much it expected to get for them. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, an official of a Providence, R.I.-based company said his company 
has agreed to buy two of the stations -- WPRI-TV in Providence, R.I., and 
WTKR-TV in Norfolk, Va. Narragansett Capital Inc. has agreed to buy the 
stations for a sum close to industry estimates of $150 million, said co-owner 
Jonathan Nelson. He would not give the specific purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked both markets," he said. "We think they are attractive, growing, 
healthy markets. They ought to be leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Agreements also are said to have been reached for the sale of three other 
Knight-Ridder stations. The New York Times reported today that Young 
Broadcasting of New York will buy WKRN-TV in Nashville, Tenn., for more than 
$50 million; Burnham Broadcasting of Chicago will acquire WALA-TV in Mobile, 
Ala., for $40 million, and News-Press and Gazette Co. of St. Joseph, Mo., will 
acquire KOLD-TV in Tucson, Ariz., for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Other stations up for sale by Knight-Ridder are KTVY-TV in Oklahoma City; 
WTEN-TV in Albany, N.Y., and WJRT-TV in Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The stations are all VHF network affiliates and collectively accounted for 
about 5% of Knight-Ridder's revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been pleased by the proposals we have received for our stations," said 
James K. Batten, president and chief executive. "Although a number of broadcast 
properties are reported to be on the market, it is evident there is demand for 
quality broadcast operations in good markets." 
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects to finish its negotiations soon and begin seeking 
the approval of the Federal Communications Commission for the transactions.

Summer drivers may be in for higher gasoline prices and spot shortages as 
demand strains the nation's already bulging refineries and new octane rules in 
parts of the country further restrict some supplies, experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Pump prices usually increase during the summer as more motorists take to the 
roads, but analysts say this year's prices could exceed the normal seasonal 
trend. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, the average price of gasoline was 92.8 cents a gallon. By 
August, the average price exceeded $1, according to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics in Washington.

TOM CHAPIN BRANCHES OUT IN 'FAMILY TREE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
 -- A parade passes by on Tom 
</P>
<P>
Chapin's children's album, "Family Tree.' 
</P>
<P>
Tom Chapin may be familiar to many only as the handsome, button-down host of 
TBS' weekly "National Geographic Explorer" series. But some may know him as the 
'60s folk singer who kept the faith and never stopped singing the kind of music 
he loved best. 
</P>
<P>
Today at Pepperdine, Chapin will perform songs for all ages in concert with 
singer Tom Paxton. 
</P>
<P>
Chapin's "Family Tree" album, recently released by A&amp;M Records, is a 
tuneful blend of heart and whimsy that joins a blossoming renaissance in 
children's recordings. The lowly status of this neglected field is changing as 
Chapin and other high-caliber artists, such as Canada's platinum phenomenon 
Raffi, take advantage of the marketing doors opened by child-conscious baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
From a Taos, N.M., rest stop during a recent family vacation trip, Chapin 
explained why he decided the time was right for a children's album. 
</P>
<P>
"I have kids now (two young daughters)," he laughed, "and I want to sing about 
the whole human experience. Folk music talks about people. It has that sense of 
groundedness that says, 'I know where I came from, where I am, where I'm 
going.' " 
</P>
<P>
Critical attention for Chapin's mellow musical fare for adults about life and 
love has been favorable, but modest, over the years. As a musician, he never 
attained the high-profile standing of his late brother, pop legend Harry 
Chapin. 
</P>
<P>
His eclecticism may be partly responsible. Chapin was a college basketball 
all-star. Just out of college, he worked as both deep-sea diver and score 
composer for the award-winning "Blue Water, White Death" shark documentary in 
1969. In the '70s, he was the Emmy-winning host of ABC's "Make a Wish" 
children's program and, in 1982, starred in the Broadway musical "Pump Boys and 
Dinettes." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping his brother's memory alive, Chapin served as musical director and 
arranger for Harry's Broadway musical "Cotton Patch Gospel," then shared the 
musical direction with brother Steve on the recent "Lies and Legends: The 
Musical Stories of Harry Chapin." 
</P>
<P>
As an activist, he continues to support Harry's informational World Hunger Year 
project. 
</P>
<P>
We're a family and we're a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Our roots go deep down in history. 
</P>
<P>
The children's album reflects Chapin's own close-knit, extraordinary family 
background. 
</P>
<P>
Grandfather Kenneth Burke was a lauded writer, critic and philosopher. 
Grandfather James, a painter; Aunt Rose a playwright and father Jim a noted 
jazz drummer who played with Woody Herman and Tommy Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky being born into the family I was," Chapin said. "My dad and mom 
were divorced, but my grandparents and great-grandparents were always around." 
</P>
<P>
It was Grandmother Chapin, "the seminal figure in our lives," who prized "the 
language of music." 
</P>
<P>
So Chapin was a choirboy and reluctantly studied the clarinet. Then, at 12, he 
and his brothers heard the Weavers and Pete Seeger. It was a pivotal 
experience; folk music shaped their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It was that romance of real people in blue jeans making such beautiful, 
committed music." 
</P>
<P>
Golden sun going down, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Gentle blue giant spin us around. 
</P>
<P>
On "Family Tree," Chapin's gentle themes of family and surroundings remain 
pretty much the same, leavened with contagious silliness and executed with 
excellent instrumentals and vocals. (Judy Collins joins him for some songs.) 
</P>
<P>
"I like music that can open doors, that provides a generational connection. My 
hope is that adults and kids will listen to my music together," Chapin said. "I 
want them to recognize themselves and their world -- and I want 'em to laugh."

FESTIVITIES HERALD CHINESE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the year of the serpent -- 4687 on the Chinese calendar -- and legend 
has it that children born "under the serpent" will be wise, compassionate, 
talented and versatile. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the new year, there will be 10,000 firecrackers to chase away evil 
spirits, Sze Tse the comical Chinese lion to spread good luck, and majestic 
papier-mache and fabric dragons will be manned by scores of skillful 
martial-arts dancers. There also will be graceful Chinese ribbon dancers, 
marching groups in colorful traditional costumes, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, 
drill teams, floats and bands, all scheduled for the annual Golden Dragon 
Parade in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chinatown Parade 
</P>
<P>
The parade, at 3 p.m. today, is a celebration of the Chinese New Year -- Yuan 
Tan -- and is Chinatown's way of saying gung hay fat choy: best wishes, good 
luck and a prosperous new year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the actual Chinese New Year began Feb. 6, on the second new moon of 
winter, the Golden Dragon Parade traditionally marches on a weekend to reduce 
traffic and parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour-plus parade begins at City Hall on Main Street, goes north to 
Sunset Boulevard, turns left on Sunset to North Broadway, right on North 
Broadway and moves on through Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gin, who has been involved with the parade for eight years, will be among 
the instructors and students from the Yau Kung Mon Kung Fu Institute dancing 
beneath a golden dragon costume. The costume was handcrafted in Hong Kong and 
consists of a large, bejeweled, papier-mache head and a flowing fabric body. At 
least 30 people at a time -- wearing gold trousers and tennis shoes -- are 
required to manipulate this dragon through its paces in a centuries-old 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Just how long is the institute's golden dragon? 
</P>
<P>
"I never measured it," says Richard Wan, Kung Fu master and owner of the 
institute. Then he laughs and adds, "My wife says it's about half of a city 
block." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dragon Dancers 
</P>
<P>
Gin explains that the dragon dance is a sort of Chinese "follow the leader." 
The person wearing the cumbersome head is the lead dancer, who in turn follows 
another dancer bearing a stick with a ball, said to represent either the sun, 
the moon or a pearl. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever the ball goes, the dragon follows," says Gin, whose parents came here 
from China. "If the guy who is controlling the ball bounces it, then the head 
goes up and everybody behind the head follows." The result is a sort of ripple 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing through the streets in this manner can be exhausting, and the dancers 
usually work in shifts. By the end of the parade, more than 50 people will have 
been part of the golden dragon. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, dragon dancing takes Kung Fu students only a few days to learn. 
But lion dancing can take as much as a year. 
</P>
<P>
The lion dance requires only two people, but the team must execute intricate 
steps with perfect synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
Wan, who says, "I come from the old school," learned his dancing in Hong Kong. 
"It takes two to tango. . . . It takes a lot of coordination and not everybody 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Lion dancers also must have a foundation in Kung Fu to master the dance and 
maintain the strength and energies required by the 70-pound costume. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Good Luck 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the dance is to bring good luck, and the goal of the dancers is 
to emulate the movements of a lion with playful cat-like steps and motions. The 
"head" must learn how to make exaggerated movements, manipulate the lion's 
movable eyes, ears and mouth, and the "tail" must follow his lead. A drummer, 
gong player and cymbalist accompany the lion dancers as they prance through the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people are expected to turn out for all the colorful Chinese 
pageantry, and Gin notes that parking in Chinatown is somewhat limited. He 
advises coming early, finding parking in an outlying area and walking to 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Cutter, secretary of the sponsoring Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, says 
on-street parking will be available along Sunset and Broadway. But he suggests 
parade-goers "come early and have lunch in a (Chinatown) restaurant and make a 
day of it." 
</P>

DESIGNER MENUS AT FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Unleash the creativity of 16 top Los Angeles interior designers, combine it 
with the talents of an equal number of outstanding area chefs and 
restaurateurs, mix in the equivalent amount of celebrities, and you have the 
recipe for the American Institute of Wine and Food fund-raiser, "Celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
This showing of holiday dining table-top designs and menus will be open to the 
public today and Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. in the 5th-floor Grand Court/Galleria 
of the Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Intimate to Elaborate 
</P>
<P>
Displays range from the intimate "A Cultural Affair," designed by Barbara Barry 
for Merry Norris, president of the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission, to 
Waldo Fernandez's "Home Casino Party," created for client Merv Griffin and 
featuring a game table flown in from Resorts International in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Barry designed a low custom table and chaises for serving the dinner menu of 
champagne and truffle soup, circle of lobster in salt crust, square of veal in 
filo pastry with Port wine sauce and Mondrian of fresh fruit puree developed by 
Joachim Splichal of Patina. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to express her (Norris') personal identity," Barry said, so 
accessories to the oxblood-gold-and-yellow-hued setting include Norris' 
personal art books, paintings and sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
To accompany Griffin's home-casino party setting, Michael Roberts of Trumps 
designed a menu of cheese and artichoke croquette, clam chowder, roasted game 
hens with candied lemon and flourless chocolate cake. Turkish designer Kalef 
Alaton has used the theme "The Feast of Ramadan" in a design for Terry (Mrs. 
Dennis) Stanfill. Ron Gucciardo, Alaton's assistant, described the setting as 
"very opulent, with lots of Puiforcat silver and large-scale suede-upholstered 
dining chairs with gilt legs." Chefs/restaurateurs Mary Sue Milliken and Susan 
Feniger of City Restaurant and Border Grill developed the menu for this 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Opulent also describes the "Russian Easter" theme designer Craig Wright chose 
for actor Michael Douglas and his wife, Diandra. "Mrs. Douglas is very fond of 
Russian furniture," Wright said, "and has a collection in their New York 
apartment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bristol Glass Eggs 
</P>
<P>
The table centerpiece is made of French 19th-Century Bristol glass eggs, 
mounted in gold-washed bronze. The multicolored Flora Danica china is banded by 
gold and accompanied by Odiot of Paris gold-washed silver. The menu for the 
dinner was created by sister and brother Pam and Peter Morton of Morton's. It 
includes borscht, lamb with pickle sauce, spicy red cabbage, potato pancakes, 
sweet-and-sour cucumber salad and apple strudel. 
</P>
<P>
Quite a different approach was taken by designer Frank Pennino in his 
"Thanksgiving in the Mountains" theme for John and Rose Candy. The setting is 
the porch of a home in the Adirondacks, complete with pine trees. Twig 
furniture accompanies a quilt-covered table set with pewter, sponge ware and a 
woodsy centerpiece. The dinner menu, designed by Rolf Nonnast of Saddle Peak 
Lodge, includes parsnip mousse, quail with wild mushrooms and brioche stuffing, 
assorted baby squash, four-leaf salad and chestnut souffle. 
</P>
<P>
Other themes, their designers and the menu creators include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Midsummer's Night Dream, designer Val Arnold and chef Jean Francois 
Meteigner of L'Orangerie for William and Jean French Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New Year's Eve, designer Tom Buckley and chef Michel Blanchet of L'Ermitage 
for Lady Chaplin (Oona O'Neill). 
</P>
<P>
 -- St. Valentine's Day, designer Susan Cohen and restaurateur Piero Selvaggio 
of Valentino's for Deborah Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Spring Luncheon, designer Phyllis Rowen Sugarman and restaurateur Michael 
McCarty of Michael's for Bob Newhart. 
</P>
<P>

chef Leonard Schwartz of 72 Market Street for Dudley Moore. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 -- Evening at the Opera, designer Jim Northcutt and chef/restaurateur Michel 
Richard of Citrus for Douglas S. Cramer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Summer Picnic, designer Nancy Goslee Power and chef/restaurateur Ken Frank 
of La Toque for Hugh Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cast Party for Oprah Winfrey, designer Janet Polizzi and chef Elka Gilmore 
for Jerry and Carole Isenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halloween, designer John Patton and chef/restaurateur John Sedlar of St. 
Estephe for Loretta Swit. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the showing may be purchased for $10 at the door of the Pacific

ARABIAN FAIR AND FANTASY; 
</P>
<P>
A DATE WITH THE INDIO FESTIVAL MEANS CAMEL RACES, PAGEANTRY, PARADES AND A 
PANCAKE BREAKFAST 
</P>

<P>
There are hundreds of county fairs across the nation, but none is quite like 
the annual exposition that began Friday in Indio. 
</P>
<P>
The main attractions at Riverside County's National Date Festival are ostrich 
and camel races, followed by the showy musical pageant that's billed as an 
"Arabian Nights Fantasy." Even the fairground is one of a kind, with oases of 
palm trees and Moorish-style buildings decked out with domes, minarets and 
keyhole-shaped doorways. 
</P>
<P>
This is the 43rd consecutive Date Festival, which now has a 10-day run and 
draws more than a quarter-million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Gates open daily at 10 a.m. (through Feb. 26) and most fair-goers arrive in 
time for the afternoon ostrich and camel races. Never mind that these 
dromedaries and long-necked birds are shipped in from Kansas instead of the 
Sahara and South Africa; they put on a hilarious show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
10 Degrees Below Zero in Kansas 
</P>
<P>
"My camels and ostriches are looking forward to the warm weather in California, 
and so am I," Joe Hedrick said in a telephone interview a week before the 
festival opened. He was speaking from Hedrick's Exotic Animal Farm in central 
Kansas, where the temperature was 10 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
This is Hedrick's fourth year as organizer of the fair's novel races. His 
one-hour shows begin with Roman-style chariots pulled by unpredictable 
ostriches. Not all the drivers are gladiators; look for Bugs Bunny and even a 
California Raisin character. Jockeys later mount the ostriches for 
"feather-back" races around the arena. 
</P>
<P>
Riders in Arabian costumes also rock around the course on the humps of camels, 
who seem to have minds of their own once they leave the starting gates. In 
between races, a llama, zebra and an Arabian horse show some tricks they've 
been taught by Hedrick and his animal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
"I bring 90 or so exotic and domestic animals to the festival," Hedrick said. 
"Kids really go for the kangaroo in the fair's petting zoo." He also offers 
camel and elephant rides. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Hedrick's animals will be in the date festival parade along Indio's 
streets Monday morning, and every night one of his elephants, a llama, three 
camels and an Arabian horse appear on stage in the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
That hourlong musical is another favorite of festival visitors, who watch the 
fairy tale performed on an outdoor stage built to resemble a marketplace in old 
Baghdad. More than 75 area residents are in the cast and choir, including Gwen 
Harlowe, a convalescent-home social director. She's been part of the show for 
29 years and now is a soloist who plays a leading role as the queen, Calipha 
Nuzhet al Fuad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

'Authentic Arabian Dances' 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago we had authentic Arabian dances," Harlowe says, "but the audience 
got restless, so now the production has become more flamboyant." 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of action in this year's tale. It's about a pretender trying to 
take over the throne by marrying Princess Shalimar, who's in love with a slave. 
A smoke bomb announces the appearance of the great genie, and he tips the 
princess off that the slave is really Aladdin, the true prince. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll never see anything like this on the stage in Los Angeles," says 
Harlowe, who adds that the "Arabian Nights Fantasy" draws an audience of 6,000 
almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds also gather to see the professional entertainers, who appear twice daily 
on the Arabian Nights stage. 
</P>
<P>
Today's headliner is Cristy Lane, whose gospel album, "One Day at a Time," had 
more than 4 million sales. In 1979, she was named the Academy of Country 
Music's top new female artist of the year, and has since recorded 20 gold and 
platinum albums. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's stage show is billed as a Fiestacade, featuring mariachis, folkloric 
dancers and comic Jose Gonzalez Gonzalez, who plays bottles and frying pans 
while dancing, singing and telling jokes. 
</P>
<P>
The All-American Boys Chorus is scheduled for Monday, and on Tuesday and 
Wednesday, Jerry Jeff Walker, who wrote "Mr. Bojangles," presents his one-man 
show of songs and stories. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rajun' Cajun," as songwriter Doug Kershaw is known, takes the spotlight 
Thursday and Friday. He can play 29 different instruments, including the 
violin, an audience favorite. At times, the Rajun' Cajun fiddles so hard that 
the hairs of his bow begin smoking and then disintegrate. (Luckily, there's 
always an extra supply of bows on stage.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Johnny Lee to Perform 
</P>
<P>
Next Saturday, country singer Johnny Lee, who gained notoriety from the movie 
"Urban Cowboy," will perform hits from his best-selling albums, including 
"Looking for Love." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will be treated to other entertainment as they wander the fairground. 
Returning this year is the All-American High Diving Team, which climaxes its 
spectacular show with an 85-foot dive into a pool that's only 9 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
Also booked for the run of the festival are the Shanachie folk singers, 
puppeteer Freddie Prez, the Mitchell Marionettes, magician Al Lampkin, Scottish 
singer Alex Beaton and Ted the blacksmith. 
</P>
<P>
Another attraction is a team of Clydesdale horses that pull their Budweiser 
beer wagon around the fairground and are on exhibit daily. 
</P>
<P>
As at some county fairs, horse racing with parimutuel betting is an attraction 
at the date festival -- but only on a television screen. This year, a sports 
center was opened at the fairground with satellite wagering on races that are 
run at Santa Anita and Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
More traditional are the thrill rides and games of chance along the fair's 
colorful carnival midway. 
</P>
<P>
At the show barn, proud members of 4-H and Future Farmers of America display 
their prize livestock and blue ribbons. In another building, home-baked pies 
and handmade quilts are admired at the Home Arts Show, while floral 
arrangements attract attention at the Flower and Garden Show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painters and Shutterbugs 
</P>
<P>
The creations of local painters and shutterbugs are featured in the Fine Art 
and Photographic exhibitions. Master wood carvers give demonstrations in 
another hall, which also hosts the Gem and Mineral Show, and there are plenty 
of stands selling souvenirs and cotton candy. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors who plan their outing for the Monday holiday should arrive in Indio in 
time for the festival's street parade. There will be marching bands, drum 
majors and majorettes, color squads, drill teams, clowns, antique autos, 
equestrian groups and floats decorated with an Arabian Nights theme. 
</P>
<P>
There's a pancake breakfast in Miles Avenue City Park from 6 a.m. until the 
parade's kickoff time at 10 a.m. Besides all-you-can-eat pancakes served by the 
Coachella Valley Lions Club, the menu includes grilled ham, scrambled eggs, 
orange juice and coffee or milk. Adults pay $3.50, children $2. 
</P>
<P>
Dates -- more than 100 types -- are displayed at the fair in the Taj Mahal 
building. A date-recipe contest is part of the Home Arts Show, and on Tuesday, 
judges will be tasting date cookies, cakes, breads, pies, puddings, sauces and 
other date concoctions. Visitors shouldn't leave the festival without sipping a 
date milk shake at one of the refreshment stands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Only to Iraq 
</P>
<P>
More dates are grown in California than anywhere else in the world except for 
Iraq, and the Coachella Valley produces 95% of all dates harvested in the 
United States. The 1987 crop and its byproducts had a value of more than $37 
million. No wonder that tasty fruit gets top billing at the Riverside County 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and buildings at the National Date Festival are open from 10 a.m. to 10 
p.m. every day through Feb. 26; the midway operates until midnight. Admission 
is $4, children ages 5-11 pay $2; free to children 4 and younger. Friday 
admission for children 11 and younger is free, when accompanied by an adult; 
seniors 62 and older can enter for $3.50 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the gate admission are the Arabian Nights Fantasy pageant, 
presented nightly at 6:45 p.m., and all shows by the professional entertainers, 
who appear twice daily at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Admission to camel and ostrich races, 
at 1 and 3:30 p.m. daily, is $1 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Entry is $1 per adult for satellite wagering on thoroughbred races from Santa 
Anita (Wednesday-Sunday afternoon) and harness races from Los Alamitos 
(Tuesday-Saturday evening). 
</P>
<P>
The fairground covers 110 acres in downtown Indio and is bordered by California 
111, Arabia and Oasis streets and Doctor Carreon Boulevard (formerly 47th 
Avenue). Festival parking is $2 just south of the boulevard. From Los Angeles, 
take Interstate 10 east about 140 miles to Indio. Exit Indio Boulevard to 
Clinton Street, turn right. Clinton turns into Dr. Carreon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
For overnight lodging, contact the Indio Chamber of Commerce: (619) 347-0676. 
Fair information: (619) 342-8247.

FBI INVESTIGATES L.A. DEPUTIES' ROLE IN CERRITOS MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH and TRACY WOOD, Times Staff Writers 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a civil rights investigation 
into a melee at a Cerritos bridal shower in which guests alleged that they were 
beaten by sheriff's deputies, a bureau spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
FBI spokesman Jim Neilson said the civil rights investigation began Monday, but 
he could not estimate how long it would take. Results of the probe will be 
forwarded to the civil rights divisions of the U.S. attorney's offices in both 
Los Angeles and Washington for a decision on any possible prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block "welcomes the FBI probe," said department information 
Sgt. John Witt. Block earlier said at a news conference that his deputies acted 
with "great restraint" after being battered by rocks and bottles while trying 
to disperse guests at the Feb. 11 party. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation also was hailed by Garo Mardirossian, attorney for members of 
the Dole family, at whose home the bridal shower was held. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a homemade videotape of part of the incident as evidence of improper 
conduct by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Once anyone sees those tapes, they'll realize this is not an empty complaint," 
said Mardirossian. Part of the tape shows a deputy using his baton to hit at 
least one man lying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Responsibility Falls to Agency 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Medrano, deputy chief of the complaints unit and civil rights monitor 
for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, said the FBI is responsible for 
investigating all civil rights complaints under 1968 amendments to Title 18 of 
the federal Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Neilson nor Medrano would say what prompted the FBI to look into the 
Cerritos incident. Medrano said that at any given time "a significant number of 
cases . . . are pending" involving the many law enforcement agencies in the 
seven counties that make up the U.S. attorney's central district. He declined 
to say if any others involve the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
According to Block, 10 deputies were battered and bruised during the melee at 
the Dole home. Mardirossian said 24 of the 34 men and women arrested had 
"significant bruising from batons or billy clubs." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department, meanwhile, released additional information Friday on 
the sequence of events. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Reg Lawson said a caller, identified only as "Sanchez," telephoned the 
Lakewood station Saturday night to report men with "sticks and knives" fighting 
in front of the Dole house. 
</P>
<P>
A report from an observation helicopter a few minutes later said there was no 
sign of a fight but that "numerous" party-goers were gathered in front of the 
house. Lawson said that the telephone number that "Sanchez" said he was calling 
from turned out to be that of a business nowhere near the area and that there 
was no one at the business named Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lawson said other callers also reported the fight. The tape-recording 
system used for emergency calls was out of service over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson also provided more detail on how the melee began. He said that Sgt. 
William Unland and a force of about 50 officers were unsuccessful in ordering 
party guests to disperse. Unland and a number of the officers went to a low 
gate in front of the Dole home. Unland gave the party-goers 10 seconds to 
disperse and began counting backward from 10. When he received no response, 
Lawson said, Unland ordered his deputies to move forward and arrest those 
present. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lawson, as Unland stepped through the gate, he told Dole he was 
under arrest. When Unland tried to grab Dole, the officer was shoved against 
the wall and Dole moved back toward the house. 
</P>
<P>
Unland said he then was rushed by about four men and, in response, began 
swinging his baton. And at this point, Lawson said, Unland reported that beer 
bottles and rocks were thrown, some of which hit and injured the sergeant.

TEEN CHOIR MEMBER SHOT, KILLED BY YOUTHS IN WATTS SCHOOLYARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old church choir member was shot and killed Friday afternoon after a 
group of teenagers intruded on a neighborhood basketball game at the 96th 
Street Elementary School in Watts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County coroner identified the youth as Jacguies Rutledge. 
Neighbors, who saw the body lying on the basketball court for two hours before 
being removed by coroner's officials, said that Rutledge was well-known and 
liked in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Playing Basketball 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Robert Kimball said the victim and his friends were playing 
basketball about 3:30 p.m. when three other youths, believed to be 11, 12 and 
14 years old, walked up on a sidewalk outside the school's fence and started 
arguing with one of the players. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't matter what the dispute was about -- it was just a kids' 
argument, it was not racial, not gang, not narcotics," Kimball said. He said 
Rutledge walked over and tried to protect his younger friend. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Cool it, you're bigger than him,' " Kimball said. "As he starts to 
walk away with the younger kid, the 14-year-old pulled a handgun from his 
waistband and shot him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends Fled 
</P>
<P>
Kimball said there were eight youngsters playing basketball and several 
children from 9 to 12 watching as the shooter and his friends fled. 
</P>
<P>
A search of the area for the three intruders was unsuccessful, police said. 
However, officers said they had a lead on their identities. Some witnesses said 
the assailants fled in a white car. 
</P>
<P>
One witness, who did not want to be identified, said he was in a grassy field 
across from the school, "watching birds, then I heard shots and happened to 
look." He said he saw a dozen children running to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge's girlfriend, Cassandra Williams, 14, said he was not in a gang and 
did not take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Watts, and people come here just to shoot anybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Baker, a neighbor who lived across from Rutledge on Firth Boulevard, said 
the victim went by the nickname "Jock" and was "no gang-banger," street slang 
for gang member. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a devout churchgoer," Baker said. "He'd give everybody respect. That's 
why I can't understand why he got killed." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Rutledge had been at her house earlier in the day but left to play 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Simon, business manager at the church Rutledge attended, which is next 
door to the small yellow stucco house where he lived with his family, said the 
youth recently had been accepted for a position in the Job Corps and was 
awaiting his first day of work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Really Nice' 
</P>
<P>
"He was a really happy-go-lucky guy, really nice," Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow church member said Rutledge played drums and sang in the church choir. 
</P>
<P>
"He was real funny and happy," said the woman, who would identify herself only 
as Loretha. "He never bothered anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Unified School District spokesman Guido Rivero said the youth "was 
killed by a bullet in the back of the head by an unknown-caliber handgun." 
</P>
<P>
The shooting was not the first at a school in the neighborhood, where gang 
warfare and drug dealing are chronic problems. Last Nov. 22, a few blocks away 
at 102nd Street School, a man died a few hours after being shot four times in 
full view of three kindergarten classes. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the shooting on Friday frightened her, Lakisha McCoy, 11, a 
fourth-grader who plays near the basketball courts at the 96th Street School 
every day, said, "No, because I (have) seen this so many times that I'm not 
afraid."

 SCHOOL STANDS AND RECEIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garfield High School and teacher Jaime Escalante have received six bronze 
plaques commemorating the 200th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution 
and the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
The plaques were created by artist Brett-Livingstone Strong and are being 
presented to schools around the country to promote "the Constitution spirit." 
In the case of Garfield, they were made available by the California 
Bicentennial Commission to salute Escalante, whose success in teaching math to 
inner-city students was the subject of the film, "Stand and Deliver." 
</P>
<P>
Garfield, in East Los Angeles, is the first high school in the country to 
receive the plaques. 
</P>
<P>
Strong, who has also created a National Monument to the Presidency, which will 
be dedicated by President Bush in April, was at Garfield for a presentation 
ceremony.

 WOMAN CHARGED IN THREATS TO ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman accused of sending more than 5,000 letters threatening to kill actor 
Michael J. Fox was has been charged with five counts of making terrorist 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
Tina M. Ledbetter, 26, who was released on $50,000 bail earlier this month 
following her arrest Feb. 3, could be sentenced to up to three years in prison 
on each count if convicted, Deputy Dist. Atty. Norman J. Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Ledbetter, of Camarillo, allegedly initiated her letter-writing campaign in 
early 1988 because she was upset over Fox's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro said that, although Ledbetter has no criminal record and cannot be 
labeled as a "terrorist" in the traditional sense, he filed the "terrorist 
threats" counts against her because no other law allows prosecution of suspects 
who intend to terrorize their victims by threatening to kill them. 
</P>
<P>
The threatening letters, all sent to Fox at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, 
prompted the star of the NBC television series "Family Ties" to hire a 
bodyguard for himself and his pregnant wife.

 METRO RAIL'S START PUSHED BACK AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Rapid Transit District officials announced Friday a further 
delay in the start of Metro Rail service because of soil conditions that have 
slowed excavation. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of Metro Rail service, which had previously been postponed, was 
scheduled for Jan. 4, 1993, but RTD General Manager Alan F. Pegg said in a 
statement that "unanticipated factors" have caused additional delays. 
</P>
<P>
Pegg said the discovery of contaminated soil and unsuitable ground conditions 
slowed excavation near Union Station and between 4th and 7th streets in 
downtown Los Angeles. That, coupled with past delays in acquiring property, has 
led officials to postpone the opening date of the $1.25-billion first phase of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
A new opening date will be announced "as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials earlier estimated that the cost of realigning the subway to avoid 
the pocket of hazardous soil near Union Station would add an additional $4.2 
million to the project's price tag.

2 EX-OFFICERS FACE CHARGES IN SHOOTING OF BIKER IN TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal conspiracy charges have been filed against two former Torrance police 
officers who allegedly lied about the accidental shooting of an unarmed suspect 
in order to make it appear that the man, partially paralyzed as a result, 
provoked the shooting by moving suddenly, as if to reach for a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Pappas, 27, and Mark Holden, 30, were charged by the Los Angeles County 
district attorney Thursday with conspiracy to obstruct justice and conspiracy 
to falsely charge another with a crime. Both are free on their own recognizance 
pending arraignment next week in Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, each could be sentenced to as many as three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas and Holden were fired by the Torrance Police Department after the May 
shooting, as was a third officer who also was accused of lying about the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Get Immunity 
</P>
<P>
The third officer, Timothy Thornton, reported the alleged conspiracy to his 
superiors and probably will be granted immunity in exchange for testifying 
against the other two, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from the shooting last May 9 of Patrick J. Coyle, 30, of 
Torrance, a construction worker who was riding his motorcycle on Western Avenue 
about 10 p.m. when he was stopped by Pappas. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas, riding alone in his squad car, reported that he pulled Coyle over 
because he was "acting suspiciously" in a neighborhood frequented by heroin 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas drew his .45-caliber pistol, cocked it and pointed it at Coyle, who 
remained astride his motorcycle, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle later told investigators that he obeyed Pappas' order to remove a lug 
wrench from his jacket and drop it on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that Thornton and Holden arrived on the scene. Holden walked behind 
Coyle and grabbed both his arms in a restraining hold, Darden said. As Coyle 
was being held, Pappas' gun discharged and the bullet struck Coyle on the chin, 
lodging in the back of his skull, police reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting appeared to be an accident, Darden said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Initial Statement 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports filed along with the charges, however, the officers 
initially told superiors that Pappas responded as Coyle reached toward his 
waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas was quoted in a subsequent police report admitting: "Nothing was said, 
'Let's do this and let's do that.' We, you know, came up with a story. It was 
just sort of: 'Hey, he had a wrench.' . . . 'Yeah, he had a wrench.' . . . and 
that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Pappas and the other officers initially told Police Department investigators 
that it was only after the shooting that they learned the "weapon" was a 
wrench, police reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton said he went along with the story after his training officer, Holden, 
pressured him by saying, "We need to go to Tim's (Pappas') aid. . . . The 
story's got to be right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was a probationary employee and said he feared his job would be in 
danger if he did not go along with the story. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after the shooting, according to the reports, Thornton told a 
superior that the shooting was unprovoked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tensed Up' 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports on the incident, Pappas, when confronted with 
Thorton's accusation, admitted to department administrators that he had "tensed 
up" and accidentally pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a killer," Pappas said, according to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Pappas and Holden denied the charges. Thornton's attorney could not 
be reached for comment Friday.

OPPONENTS CRITICIZE ASSEMBLYMAN BANE OVER S&amp;L BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER and MARK GLADSTONE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after accepting $18,000 in campaign contributions from two financial 
institutions early last year, Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) introduced 
legislation that opponents said would have aided the two firms in a pending 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, introduced by Bane last February, prohibited litigants in civil 
lawsuits from obtaining confidential information from the state Savings and 
Loan Department through a subpoena. The bill, supported by the California 
League of Savings Institutions, passed the Assembly with no opposition last 
year but died in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
An Assembly consultant and the bill's opponents say the measure could have been 
retroactive, thereby affecting the pending lawsuit. The defendants in the case 
were financial institutions that who were seeking to prevent documents obtained 
from the Savings and Loan Department with a subpoena from being introduced as 
evidence against them. Both were major contributors to Bane. Representatives of 
the two financial institutions could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bane did not return phone calls Friday. The Daily News of Los Angeles reported 
that he said he did nothing improper, quoting Bane as saying that he intended 
to prevent disclosure of all confidential Savings and Loan Department records 
without a court order, including those involved in the pending legal case. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, chairman of the influential Rules Committee and a champion of the savings 
and loan industry, reportedly said: "I would have introduced the bills if there 
were no contributions. Anything wrongly obtained should be returned." 
</P>
<P>
The Savings and Loan Department said that the measure would merely clarify 
existing law, said Kenneth Cooley, chief counsel of the Assembly Finance and 
Insurance Committee, which unanimously sent the bill to the full Assembly with 
little discussion. He said such a clarification could have been considered 
retroactive, although Assembly committee members were not informed that it 
might apply to an ongoing lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The bill could have affected pending litigation involving American Savings 
&amp; Loan of Stockton, which has since been sold and divided into two 
financial institutions, and Gramercy Mortgage, a Burlingame-based affiliate of 
Homestead Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies were named in a December, 1982, lawsuit filed by Dividend 
Development Corp. of Santa Clara. Dividend attorney Peter Fortune said Friday 
that the suit alleges American and Gramercy improperly foreclosed on two large 
real estate projects in the Bay Area and is seeking $40 million in damages. He 
said the suit accuses Homestead of fraudulent misrepresentation and 
concealment, breach of contract and unfair business practices. Homestead filed 
a countersuit against Dividend; the litigation is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Dividend Development used a subpoena in 1985 to obtain confidential Savings and 
LoanDepartment documents about the foreclosure that "severely impeach 
Homestead's defenses and claims in the litigation," Fortune said. Homestead 
claimed that the documents were released illegally and had sought 
unsuccessfully in court to suppress the information. 
</P>
<P>
Bane received a $6,000 campaign contribution from Gramercy on Jan. 11, 1988, 
and another $6,000 on Feb. 1. On Jan. 25, 1988, he received a $6,000 campaign 
contribution from American Savings &amp; Loan. Each firm also gave him $5,000 
in early 1987. The contributions coincide with the timing of Bane's annual 
Valentine's Day dinner, his major annual fund-raiser. He introduced the savings 
and loan bill on Feb. 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
After the bill passed the Senate Banking and Commerce Committee last June, 
Dividend Development hired a lobbyist who subsequently informed Banking 
Committee Chairwoman Rose Ann Vuich (D-Dinuba) that the measure could affect 
the company's pending lawsuit. Vuich then retrieved the bill for a second look 
by her committee in August. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to pass out legislation that affects a court case," she said 
Friday. An aide to Bane added that it died when Bane failed to ask for it to be 
heard again. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it illegal to accept contributions in return for a specific 
action, such as sponsoring or supporting a bill. Bane has maintained that the 
savings and loan industry backs him because he supports their role in financing 
home construction and creating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, who ran a national savings and loan association for a decade, received a 
total of $102,480 in campaign contributions from the industry in 1987-88, 
nearly 10% of the $1.1 million he raised, according to his campaign reports.

ASIAN BETTING GAMES UPHELD BY L.A. JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major victory for operators of seven Southland card clubs, a Superior 
Court judge barred the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department on Friday from 
shutting down three Asian-style betting games. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two months after deputies conducted a series of casino raids and 
temporarily closed tables where pai-gow, pai-gow poker and super pan 9 were 
being played, Judge Kurt J. Lewin rejected the county's argument that the 
controversial games violate the state's 98-year-old gambling law. 
</P>
<P>
County attorneys have argued that the games are illegal because they feature a 
rotating banking system in which players take turns acting as the dealer, 
collecting from losers and paying winners. State law prohibits banking games. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin, siding with casino lawyers, issued a five-page decision stating that "in 
an unbroken line of decisions, the appellate courts in this jurisdiction have 
held that pai-gow (along with the two others) is not a banking game." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injunction Issued 
</P>
<P>
Lewin issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Sheriff's Department from 
taking further action against the seven card clubs, which are in Huntington 
Park, Gardena, Bell, Bell Gardens and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens and two of the clubs, the Commerce Club and the Bicycle Club, 
filed suit against the county after the raids on Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, seeking 
unspecified damages for money lost during the closings. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block then agreed to allow the games to continue while Lewin 
studied the county's argument that the games violated state law. 
</P>
<P>
"We are extremely pleased," attorney Guy Nicholson, who represents the Bicycle 
and Commerce clubs, said after the judge issued the preliminary injunction. 
</P>
<P>
"This (ruling) is good for us because one of the elements we had to prove was 
that there is a substantial likelihood that we would prevail" in the lawsuit, 
Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Kevin Brazile, saying he had not read the decision, 
declined to comment Friday except to say, "It's not a final decision on the 
merits of our argument. It's not over." 
</P>
<P>
Lewin's decision ensures that card club owners and city officials will continue 
to benefit financially from the popular Asian games at least until a full trial 
is held on the lawsuit. No trial date has been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and card club owners have complained that they would lose 
millions of dollars in revenue if the card clubs stopped offering the games. 
Almost 50% of the casinos' business is derived from the high-stakes games, and 
cities receive a percentage -- usually ranging from 7% to 13.5% -- of the 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that, Lewin said: "Plaintiffs have established by substantial 
evidence that great and irreparable harm will result if enforcement of (state 
law) against them or their customers by the Sheriff's Department continues." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens City Manager Claude Booker said the city would lose up to $6 
million if the games are stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Booker is spearheading an effort by administrators of the five cities that host 
card clubs to draft legislation that would modify the state law to ensure the 
legality of the games. The city officials expect to find a lawmaker to sponsor 
the legislation before the end of the month, Booker said.

HUNTED BROKER ARRESTED WITH LOADS OF CASH 
</P>

A stockbroker accused of disappearing with millions of dollars in client money 
was arrested at the Canadian border Friday, his pockets and luggage stuffed 
with more than $130,000 in cash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Curran, 46, of Wellesley Hills, was captured after he raised the 
suspicions of a border guard as he tried to re-enter the United States from 
Canada at Massena, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cold hit," said Bob Johnston, port director for U.S. Customs at 
Massena, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Customs officials and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston said Curran was 
carrying $32,000 in U.S. currency in his pockets and had an additional $100,000 
in currency in the luggage in the trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
Curran was discovered missing after some clients came to the Dean Witter 
Reynolds investment firm last week demanding to see him, claiming that he had 
been privately handling their money. His co-workers had believed that he was 
off on a golf vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Although initial reports said the broker may have fled with as much as $8 
million, the firm now says $3 million may be unaccounted for. Curran is also 
being sued by Bank of Boston for more than $260,000 in bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
A federal warrant was issued for his arrest Wednesday on charges of bank and 
mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said the guard's suspicions were aroused simply by Curran's 
circumstances in coming to the out-of-the-way border crossing in a small town 
about 45 miles south of Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got a U.S. (citizen) and he's not from the area. He's driving a 
Canadian rented car. He's going back to Boston. You're looking at him in the 
eye and looking for certain reactions," said Johnston in explaining why the 
guard was suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
When Curran provided his Massachusetts driver's license to prove U.S. 
citizenship, the officers checked his name in the computer and found that he 
was wanted in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Curran was charged with smuggling for failing to declare he was carrying more 
than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing was set late Friday afternoon before a U.S. magistrate in Watertown, 
N.Y.

The candidates who sought office in the November general election to represent 
Orange County in the state Senate and Assembly shared a common bond -- the 
pursuit of contributions to finance their campaigns. The chart below shows the 
distinct advantage incumbents have over their challengers in raising money. The 
figures represent money raised and spent in 1988 by the candidates for their 
campaigns. The candidate who won is listed first.

Representatives from nine Orange County organizations said Friday that their 
members will join a nationwide fast to dramatize their demand for refugee 
status for 1 million Salvadorans living in the United States and their 
opposition to military aid to El Salvador. Twenty-five people in the county 
have agreed to join the fast so far, they said. At left is Wendy Daniels, who

MATER DEI GETS STIFF TEST, BUT PASSES BY 20

When Upland High School came into Rancho Santiago College's Cook Gymnasium 
Friday night, the Highlanders didn't have fancy warm-up suits with names on the 
back, like the ones worn by Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders' numbers were ironed onto their uniforms, not sewn, and Upland 
didn't even have matching high-tops. 
</P>
<P>
Upland didn't look stylish, but for the first 16 minutes, the Highlanders -- in 
their first basketball playoff season in 11 years -- played right alongside 
Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
A run of 16 points by Mater Dei at the start of the second half put Upland away 
for good, and the Monarchs pulled away to an 85-65 victory in the second round 
of the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight, whose Monarchs are 25-2 and aiming for their 
fifth consecutive large-school championship, admitted that he was a little 
worried. Especially when Upland guard Rick Brodbeck started raining down 
three-pointers in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Brodbeck made seven three-pointers and led all scorers with 32 points. One of 
Brodbeck's long-range shots brought Upland (18-10) to within one early in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
"I was waiting for them to cool off," McKnight said. "An eight-point lead at 
the half just isn't enough against a team that can shoot like that." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for McKnight, his own long-range sharpshooter -- Dylan Rigdon -- 
was right on the mark all game. Rigdon, a senior guard headed for UC Irvine, 
made 10 of 15 shots for 25 points, including five three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Mark Morris had a trio of three-pointers in the third period to pad 
Mater Dei's lead and finished with 16 points.

EDISON USES GOOD FORTUNE TO STAY A STEP AHEAD, 56-51 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Edison High School Coach Jon Borchert was happy to take all the good fortune he 
could in a 56-51 victory over Los Alamitos Friday at Marina in the second round 
of the 5-A Southern Section playoffs. He had some problems, however, analyzing 
all his luck. 
</P>
<P>
"It just comes down to the breaks," Borchert said. "Sometimes you get them. 
Sometimes you don't. That's the only way I can explain it." 
</P>
<P>
That explains Dan Lovelady's first attempt of a one-and-one that caromed above 
the backboard and hit only net on the way down. 
</P>
<P>
That also explains how 6-9 center Bill Martineau tore the sole of a new pair of 
size 15s and had a replacement pair waiting for him on the feet of freshman 
reserve Brandon Jesse, who had just been called up to the varsity for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
And all this while Los Alamitos was in the process of turning a third-quarter, 
14-point deficit into a three-point disadvantage with less than a minute to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a basket like that (Lovelady's free throw) and we were just lucky 
that Brandon Jesse wears size 15," Borchert said. "It was real emotional. The 
kids were raring to play all week." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (15-12), who had a bye in the first round, had a 46-37 lead after 
three quarters before Los Alamitos started its comeback attempt. 
</P>
<P>
The charge slowly stalled, however, as three Los Alamitos starters fouled out 
in the final three minutes after the Griffins (12-15) had pulled within three 
points, 50-47. 
</P>
<P>
"We played real well in the first half," Borchert said. "As usual, we ended up 
with a tight game. 
</P>
<P>
"Credit their defense. It was tight. They got their hands on the ball. Give 
credit to their good defense, not our bad offense." 
</P>
<P>
That good defense limited Sunset League champion Edison to 35 shots and forced 
12 turnovers. But the Los Alamitos offense couldn't keep up, shooting 44% (18 
of 41) from the field and 60% (15 of 25) from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
Edison built a 36-22 halftime advantage as Martineau scored 10 of his 14 
game-high points and Bryan Murphy also had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos then chipped away in the third quarter, cutting the score to 46-37 
by the end of the quarter behind two three-pointers by Griffins' leading scorer 
Mike Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The Griffins opened the fourth quarter with a 9-4 run to pull within 48-45. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the sole of Martineau's right shoe ripped at the heel, forcing him 
off the court for less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
After he returned, the Chargers built a 54-49 lead on Lovelady's two free 
throws. Los Alamitos then closed within three points again on a five-foot 
jumper by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
But Martineau tipped in a missed shot, closing out the scoring.

OCEAN VIEW KEEPS MOVING WITH VICTORY

Perhaps Jim Harris, Ocean View High School basketball coach, should have stuck 
with his original plans. Last summer, he scrapped a motion offense for a power 
inside game because the players disliked it. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until they found out that they could win with it, which they did again 
Friday night with a 75-67 second-round Southern Section 5-A playoff victory 
over Etiwanda at Etiwanda. 
</P>
<P>
Harris inserted the motion offense a month ago, and the Hawks won seven of 
their final eight Sunset League games. 
</P>
<P>
"(The coaches) say we're not even close to running it right yet," senior Todd 
Norman said. "They say we are really going to win big when we do." 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks (19-9) executed the offense well enough to lead, 39-34, by halftime. 
And their patience paid even bigger dividends in the fourth quarter when they 
broke away to increase the lead to 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Eagles, who averaged 79.8 points a game this season, shot at 
will, but it didn't do any good. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game's going to be push it down, and shoot it," Etiwanda Coach Jess Evans 
said. "If you have to work too hard, then you better pass it." 
</P>
<P>
That philosophy backfired in the second half when the Eagles fell behind and 
forced shots trying to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
"They came out firing," Harris said. "That's not our style, so it took us a 
little while to get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we played a steady man-to-man defense and were patient on 
offense and it showed." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View controlled the tempo and took a 55-45 lead on Norman's basket with 
2:18 remaining in the third quarter. Norman finished with 20 points and 7 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Pelonis added six points and had 10 rebounds for the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles were led by John Adams with 32 points, Michael Jackson with 26 and 
Marcus Bell with 25.

Junior Ed O'Bannon scored 34 points to lead Artesia High School to a 74-53 
victory over Fullerton in the second round of the Southern Section 4-A boys' 
basketball playoffs Friday at Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon made 11 of 17 shots and 11 of 11 free throws. He also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia (20-5) led at halftime, 32-22, but its lead was cut to 32-26 when 
Fullerton's Pete Bach made a jump shot with 6 minutes 37 seconds left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
O'Bannon later scored nine consecutive points to give the Pioneers a 49-34 
lead. The Indians could not got closer than 12 points the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them back into the game in the second half, but we finally showed a 
killer instinct," Artesia Coach Wayne Merino said. "That's the mark of a good 
team." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard De Andre Austin scored 10 points in the first quarter, as the 
the Pioneers took a 21-11 lead. Austin scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bach led Fullerton (17-7) with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Clark had seven points and nine rebounds for Artesia. RICH GUIREMAND

The Los Angeles Starlites, who have won all the championships Major League 
Volleyball has awarded (two) only to meet with mass indifference at home, began 
their third season seemingly bent on making some sort of wave. 
</P>
<P>
And so, Friday, there on the Bren Center floor, were couples dancing to Rolling 
Stone riffs from a quintet called the Junk Band ("The Starlites' official music 
machine"), professional football cheerleaders signing autographs and, in the 
seats, a lot of people who got to the place with free tickets.

"We gave them out wherever we could," said George Corey, one of the team's four 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
The announced crowd of 1,528 -- which included those with free tickets -- was a 
big difference for a team that played in front of home crowds as sparse as 25 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually heard people cheering," said Starlites outside hitter Dale Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"This is easily twice as large as any home crowd we played in front of last 
year," said Al Gasparian, Starlites coach. 
</P>
<P>
What hasn't changed is the Starlites' habit for winning in this league. The 
Starlites, who have compiled a 36-8 record their previous two seasons, easily 
handled the Portland Spikers, 15-2, 15-11, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
The Starlites jumped to a 9-0 lead in the first game and cruised to a victory. 
The Spikers -- who were the Arizona Blaze last season and the Dallas Belles the 
season before -- held leads of 2-0 in the second game and 5-0 in the third only 
to have the Starlites overtake them in each. 
</P>
<P>
Hall's all-around game -- eight kills, eight blocks, 12 digs -- seemed to spark 
the Starlites all night. She is one of three players presently on the team who 
played on last season's championship team. Among those who left was former U.S. 
Olympic team standout Rita Crockett, who is now playing in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Though his personnel has taken a change for the drastic, Gasparian said he felt 
"fortunate that things on the court didn't look as different from last season 
as I thought they might." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Portland also only had three players from last season's team. And 
unlike the Starlites, Portland didn't have a lot to build on to begin with. The 
then-Blaze had the league's worst record last season at 5-16. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in the same position they were in before this season," said Terry 
McLaughlin, Portland coach. "But obviously they've progressed a lot farther 
then we have." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Starlites' new players making an immediate impact was Detra Brown, 
who led the team with 10 kills. Margaret Grant (17) and Sherri Brinkman-Reilly 
(16) provided solid blocking. 
</P>
<P>
The Starlites play the San Jose Golddigggers, whom they have beaten in each of 
their league championship finals, Sunday in San Jose.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: NOVELIST RECALLS LIFE AS AN EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When novelist Gwyneth Cravens served as a fiction editor at The New Yorker in 
the mid-'80s, she worked with such literary lights as Milan Kundera, Susan 
Sontag, Deborah Eisenberg, Bruce McCall, Tama Janowitz and dozens of other 
writers of similar wattage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just wonderful to work there," said Cravens, a visiting writer at UC 
Irvine this quarter. "And it was interesting to work with different kinds of 
writers with different styles. I can't think of anything more different than 
Milan Kundera ("The Unbearable Lightness of Being") and Tama Janowitz ("Slaves 
of New York"), but it was very rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
How much editing each author needed varied, Cravens said. "One author will turn 
in a completely perfect story: You don't have to change one comma. Another 
author will turn in something that needs work: You send it back and say, 
'Please rewrite this.' You work with them. The New Yorker was sort of known for 
that, that between copy editing and the editing, the author could improve the 
story." 
</P>
<P>
As a Visiting Writer at UCI, Cravens is teaching a writing workshop for 
students in the graduate writing program. She also is teaching an undergraduate 
English literature course in the short story. "It's time-consuming," she says, 
"but I find it stimulating to my own writing." 
</P>
<P>
Cravens, who is renting a house in Laguna Beach, holds her campus office hours 
on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. She's finding, however, that the office 
hours often run into overtime as a steady stream of graduate students stop by 
to discuss their writing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to find out what they want from me," she said. "That is, what can I 
say or suggest or do for them that will help their writing. They're probably 
more interested in how to get published, but I'm more interested in how they 
can be good writers because you can be a wonderful writer and not necessarily 
get published. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, Kafka published almost nothing during his life. No one saw any of 
Van Gogh's paintings while he was alive, but he must have gotten some 
satisfaction out of his work. If I could teach one thing, it would be how to 
live as a writer and be happy in your vocation as a writer no matter what the 
fate of your work is." 
</P>
<P>
When Cravens moved to New York from New Mexico in 1965 to attend New York 
University on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, she thought she'd wind up an English 
professor. But while working on her master's degree in literature, she began 
meeting the writers and poets living in Greenwich Village. Although she had 
ambitions of one day becoming a writer, she said, they were "secret ambitions." 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, it was odd for a woman to think about being a writer," she said. 
"Even from my background, to think about being an English professor was quite a 
leap. So I secretly wanted to be a writer and secretly admired Katherine 
Mansfield and Virginia Woolf and other women writers, but I was too shy to 
really describe myself a writer. But I wrote all the time, and I began to meet 
these other writers and I thought, 'well, you could write, you could get 
published and so on,' and I began to write and get published." 
</P>
<P>
She began selling articles to Mademoiselle magazine, and in 1966, a few months 
after earning her master's degree, she landed a job as an editorial assistant 
at The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Cravens, who was married at the time, left The New Yorker after a year to 
indulge in a typically '60s fantasy: Using their savings, she and her husband 
"dropped out" to go live and write in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
They lived in Spain and Germany for a year until their money ran out. During 
that time, Cravens gave birth to a daughter, Dovie. When they returned to New 
York, she got her old job back at The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to be more active as a writer, she left The New Yorker in 1971 and got 
a job writing and editing for Seventeen magazine. "It was a woman's magazine 
with all the limitations that implies," she said. "By then, I was publishing 
articles in Harper's and I was invited to be an editor at Harper's, and I wound 
up doing a lot of writing for them." 
</P>
<P>
Cravens became an associate editor there, but left in 1974 to write full time. 
Teaming up with Dr. John Marr, director of the New York City Bureau of 
Infectious Disease Control, she co-wrote a thriller, "Black Death." That was 
followed by another thriller, "Speed of Light." 
</P>
<P>
"The thrillers were my ticket to freedom," she said. "They financed my being 
able to stay home and write more serious kinds of fiction, which was what I had 
always had my eye on doing and had done for some little magazines and literary 
anthologies. The thrillers were very good training in plot and pacing, and I 
just learned a lot about the mechanics of novel writing." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, a year after her third book, "Love and Work," was published, Cravens 
was invited to become a fiction editor at The New Yorker. And there she 
remained for 4 1/2 years until the magazine's legendary editor William Shawn 
was fired by Samuel I. Newhouse Jr., who had bought the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons I had decided to go back to work was I wanted the privilege 
of working with Mr. Shawn, who was just one of the most remarkable people I 
have ever met," said Cravens, who also contributed fiction and nonfiction to 
the magazine. "It was the most wonderful place to work, just idyllic." 
</P>
<P>
But it just wasn't the same after Shawn left, and 2 months later, Cravens left 
the magazine to devote all of her time to novel writing. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that a writer can write anywhere, Cravens finds living in 
New York particularly conducive to being a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it was because to be around other people who are doing what you are 
doing -- and to be able to talk shop -- is very exciting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As she sees it, a university writing program is a way of creating a similar 
literary environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing is such a lonely, isolated business that to just meet with other 
people and discuss (that) you might be having the same problems, or having the 
same confusion about something, you can really help each other. Or, if you get 
a rejection and feel like it's the end of the world, and someone else says, 
'No, no, I got 10 rejections from that editor before I got accepted.' It's just 
a way of keeping yourself going, and it can be a very supportive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her teaching schedule, reading student manuscripts and holding extended 
office hours to talk to her students, Cravens has found that her stint at UCI 
has not really cut into her own writing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the winter quarter, Cravens will return to New York, where she 
has lived the past 14 years with humor writer Henry Beard, co-founder of the 
National Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond completing her novel, however, she has no long-range plans.

PHOTOGRAPHY: FEW NOTICE PRINTER BEHIND THE SCENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The works of David Gardner seem to be everywhere, but still, few people notice. 
Instead the notoriety is left to his high-profile clients, including Brett 
Weston, Kenny Rogers and the late Ansel Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, owner of Gardner Lithograph in Buena Park, stays behind the scenes, 
printing books, posters, calendars, catalogues, brochures and annual reports. 
His better-known printing efforts include "The Portfolios of Ansel Adams" and 
17 posters of Adams' most famous photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's entry into the photographic community dates back to 1975 when he was 
publishing Picture Magazine, which showcased the efforts of up-and-coming 
photographers. "It was a wonderful photographic magazine," Gardner said. "It 
brought us to the attention of photographers all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We could never make it pay financially. It was good self-advertising for us. 
It wasn't economically viable, but it helped bring us to the attention of the 
photographic community." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine, which lasted for 21 issues over a period of 6 years, brought 
Gardner to the attention of Adams, who was very demanding about the 
reproduction of his work. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Ansel knew it was possible to do things in a better way, there was no 
compromise," Gardner said. "That was the way it had to be done. Ansel's phrase 
was, 'There is no compromise with excellence; that's the objective of 
everything.' 
</P>
<P>
"He had a wonderful attitude about it. He was never unreasonable in his 
expectations. He always understood the process. He never expected it (the 
reproduction) to be a perfect replica of what he gave you, but he liked to 
explore the possibilities of the printed media." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, 63, was born in Texas and reared in Los Angeles. He took journalism 
classes at Manual Arts High School and went to college at USC. He then taught 
high school in El Monte and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He taught for 5 years, then went to work as a printing salesman. He stayed with 
that for 4 years and in 1959 started his own printing business with Orbie 
Fulmer in Huntington Park. They moved the operation to Buena Park a year later. 
They sold the business in 1986, and Gardner bought it back in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are quite unique among printers . . . in the world in terms of the 
work we do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We pioneered the use of the laser scanner for black-and-white work. It (the 
laser scanner) wasn't made to do that, it was made to make color separations. 
That's why most people buy it. But we started doing black-and-whites on it very 
early when we realized some of the possibilities. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems in printing black-and-white photographs is that most 
printers never get them black enough. If they get them black enough, the images 
are plugged up in the shadows so you can never see any detail." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner started experimenting with the scanner and found he could distort the 
tonal curve. 
</P>
<P>
"We print most black-and-white work on a 285-line screen. That means there are 
285 dots in each direction in an inch square," he said. "That's 81,225 dots in 
a square inch. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one of those dots is composed of 144 bits of visual information. So the 
scanner can examine the original prints and reflect the detail it sees in a dot 
that is put on a film by laser beam. It can do detail a camera simply can't 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Today Gardner has a lot of competition from foreign markets. "For the most part 
I think Japan and the Far East are cheaper, but they don't print as well," he 
said. "I'm proud of the fact that we're better printers in this country than 
they are in Japan. They don't begin to do black-and-white as well. 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, a book sells for five times the production cost, which includes the 
retailer's profit, the distributor's profit, freight costs. It's an expensive 
process to get them to the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's work doesn't just include photography books. One of his largest jobs 
was printing 500,000 national catalogues for Mercedes-Benz of North America 
Inc. He delivered 100,000 a month for 5 months. 
</P>
<P>
Among his other projects were the making of photographic separations for the 
first 18 Super Bowl programs and printing a 24-page insert for the David 
Hockney catalogue for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
His most recent books include "Odyssey," a selection of photographs from the 
archives of the National Geographic Society; "Light Years," the photographs of 
Morley Baer, and "Letters and Images 1916-1984," from the correspondence and 
photographs of Ansel Adams.

FAMILY LIFE: BEATING CHILDREN TO THE PUNCH ON FIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Gimme that!" 
</P>
<P>
"No! I was using it!" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah? I had it first!" 
</P>
<P>
(Ding! Welcome to Round 2 of Saturday at the Fights with Family Life. Last 
week, we observed a bout between John and Mary Jones, a fictional county 
couple, and learned from their mistakes with the help of a panel of experts. 
</P>
<P>
(This week, we'll see how the dynamics differ when the disagreement involves 
children. A typical altercation has just broken out between the Jones children, 
Benny, 12, and Billy, 9. The object in question could be just about anything, 
but in this case, it's a pencil sharpener. 
</P>
<P>
(And now, back to the action.) 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who had it first, dummy. It's mine. Now give it back!" Benny 
says. "You went in my room and got it, didn't you? You're ALWAYS going in my 
room and taking things without asking." 
</P>
<P>
"But I needed it!" Billy protests. 
</P>
<P>
"Then you should have asked me!" 
</P>
<P>
By now, the boys' voices are loud enough to be heard at the other end of the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey! Settle down in there!" shouts Mary, almost absent-mindedly. 
</P>
<P>
The boys hear their mother's admonition, but neither acknowledges it. Instead, 
Billy climbs over the couch and tries to make a run for the door -- with Benny 
close behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's YOUR pencil sharpener?" Benny asks, grabbing his brother's arm. "Did 
you lose it again?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oww! You're hurting me! Mom! Make him stop!" 
</P>
<P>
"Benny!" Mary yells. "How many times have I told you not to pick on your 
brother?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not picking on the little brat! I'm just. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't talk back to me, young man!" Mary says sternly, standing in the doorway. 
"Now what's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
Let's pause for some analysis from our panel, psychologists Marvin Rofsky of 
Orange, Lois Abrams of the Counseling Center of Irvine, Charles Browning of Los 
Alamitos, Don Steckdaub of Charter Counseling in Anaheim Hills, and Rosalyn 
Laudati of Brea. Should Mary intervene at this point, and if so, how? 
</P>
<P>
Rofsky recommends that parents stay out of their children's fights, in most 
cases. "Send them outside," he says. "Let them handle it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
He calls this kind of fighting a "Tom &amp; Jerry Show. It's a routine game 
designed to get Mom or Dad's attention. It's almost scripted." 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem," Abrams says, "is when the parent tries to come between 
the two kids. You should only do that if you've gone through referee school." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if the children are really hurting each other physically, the parent 
must intervene for safety's sake, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"But too often, parents see themselves as indispensable," Abrams says. "So they 
jump in, rather than allowing the children some space to resolve their own 
differences at their own level. Give them some time to resolve it. Otherwise, 
you're not allowing them to grow up and be responsible for themselves."

"Kids need to be allowed to make their own mistakes, within reason," Steckdaub 
says. "Fights are very normal among siblings, and it's always best, whenever 
possible, to let them reach their own resolution. But sometimes it can be 
helpful for the parent to step in and help them learn some communication 
skills." 
</P>
<P>
Steckdaub is referring to the same fair-fighting techniques we learned last 
week with John and Mary's argument. Don't "attack, raise your voice, whine, 
complain or label the other person," Browning advises. Use "I" statements 
instead of "you" statements. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, whoever makes the statement owns their feelings," Abrams says. 
</P>
<P>
Don't mention the past or other people or issues; stick to the present and the 
subject at hand, our experts say. And listen without interrupting, no matter 
how much you disagree with what you're hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, those are ideals, and it's unrealistic to expect that either you or 
your children can stick to them 100%. 
</P>
<P>
But if you must intervene to settle a dispute, try to remind the children of 
those guidelines. That's more effective, according to our experts, than 
slipping into the role of judge and trying to arbitrate all the fine points of 
the disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
And try not to take sides. Abrams says many parents have a tendency to do just 
that. "Generally speaking, the oldest or biggest child gets blamed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
If you've tried all this and the kids are still squabbling, Rofsky has another 
suggestion: "Restrict them from playing with each other until they plead and 
beg." 
</P>
<P>
Abrams has a more elaborate plan. Order the kids to fight. But give them a 
schedule, and make them do it in front of one or both parents. "As soon as Mom 
gets home in the afternoon, for example, go into a designated room, preferably 
a large room instead of the hallway where these things usually happen. Mom sits 
down, and they go at it. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they're going to look at it like, 'We're not mad right now.' But 
give them 10 or 15 minutes in any case. Then have them fight again after 
dinner, and once in the morning. If they still fight on their own time, add 
another period, say, at 2 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Parents may be able to prevent some sibling fights by paying more attention to 
their children, Abrams says: "Often the reason the kids are fighting is that 
they don't have the attention of their parents." 
</P>
<P>
She suggests that parents set up dates with their children, one at a time, to 
help alleviate that. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the fights between parents and children. Steckdaub says that in 
those cases it's essential for parents to remember that they are indeed 
parents: "Don't be afraid to be a parent. During the '60s and '70s, a lot of 
parents were saying, 'I'd rather just be my child's friend.' But that's not 
what they need from you. 
</P>
<P>
"I see kid after kid after kid in my office who says, 'I wish my parents cared 
enough to set some limits.' That doesn't mean you need to be an ogre, but you 
need limits, and you need to let the child know when they have been violated." 
</P>
<P>
"Many times the family hierarchy is out of balance," Abrams says. "It's like 
the tail is wagging the dog. You have to set down some family rules. Most 
families don't take the time to do that. (There are also) rules that are 
unspoken and covert. It's better to make them clear. That's why children tend 
to behave better in school, because they know the rules there." 
</P>
<P>
"Parents have to stand their ground," Laudati says, "even if it means repeating 
the same message 50 times. And if an argument has gotten to the point where 
it's no longer constructive, interrupt it and continue it later." 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is to acknowledge their feelings," Abrams says. 
</P>
<P>
Steckdaub says children have a real advantage over adults when it comes to 
fighting: "I've learned a lot from my kids. There have been times when they 
were fighting and driving me crazy. Fifteen minutes later, they had forgotten 
all about it. They were fine, but I was still crazy."

LAGUNA BOY TO GET $4.95 MILLION FOR INJURY IN HOME SPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-year-old boy partially paralyzed after being sucked to the bottom of a 
home spa will receive $4.95 million over the rest of his life under a 
settlement approved Friday in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives Adam options for the future that he might not have had -- to go to 
school, to have a career, to get the physical therapy and medical help he 
needs," said Robyn Walters, the victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very, very happy," the mother said. "I'm glad it's over. It's been a 
long 4 1/2 years, and this (settlement) means that we can go on living our 
lives without lawyers and courtrooms." 
</P>
<P>
Adam Walters was sucked to the floor of the back yard spa at his family's home 
in Fountain Valley one September afternoon in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Several minutes later, Adam's mother discovered the immobilized boy face down 
under water. As the boy's two sisters and brother watched in panic, his father 
tried to yank the boy free but could not overcome the spa's powerful suction 
and had to turn off the device altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no sign of lost intellectual capacities, Adam did 
suffer serious damage to his motor skills, leaving him bound to a wheelchair 
with partial paralysis in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
He also has speech problems, has lost some use of one arm and faces the 
increased risk of developing severe scoliosis -- a curvature of the spine -- 
that could require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
His family sued the makers of the spa system and the owners and real estate 
agents of the home that they were renting. The Walters maintained that the spa 
itself was dangerously designed because it had only one filter outlet instead 
of the customary two and because the drain cover had been missing since they 
began renting the house. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the defendants denied in interviews Friday that they were to 
blame in the accident, even as Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein approved 
the final settlement plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immediate Cash 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, insurance companies for the homeowners, the rental agent and the 
real estate agency agreed to pay a total of $635,000 in an immediate cash 
outlay to cover already-incurred medical and legal expenses and to set up an 
annuity fund for Adam. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Adam will receive a total of $4.95 million in regular monthly and 
5-year payments over the remainder of his life, the family's attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Walters said in a brief telephone interview after the settlement: "It's 
money for college and stuff. I'm very happy." 
</P>
<P>
The family now lives in Laguna Beach and has a spa. 
</P>
<P>
Accidents of the type that injured Adam Walters have been a concern in the hot 
tub industry, although executives said last fall that they have solved the 
problem of excessive suction. Orange County statistics weren't immediately 
available, but Los Angeles County records showed that 10 people, including six 
children under 10 years old, somehow drowned in hot tubs or spas in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bought Drain Cover 
</P>
<P>
Robyn Walters said she knew nothing of such spa accidents before Adam's mishap. 
But she said she made sure after the accident to buy a $20 anti-suction drain 
cover that is designed to prevent accidents in older model spas. 
</P>
<P>
The company that made the spa in which Adam was injured, called Blue Haven 
Pools, no longer has any assets or insurance and is not included in the 
financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Although the absence of the spa-maker from the agreement makes the settlement 
smaller than it might have been otherwise, the family's attorney, Jerrold A. 
Bloch, said he was very satisfied with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that the boy's future should be secure, at least financially," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tickled to death. I've gotten to know the family, and they're a very close 
family, just wonderful working with Adam. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's been a strain for them to get what they know he needs in medical 
attention and they've really sacrificed to do it. This will really help a lot 
in that regard," Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoided Battle 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the homeowners, Laurent and Francis Ingardia, and the rental 
agency, Mathias Properties, said their clients agreed to settle the suit to 
avoid a costly court fight but maintain they were blameless in the accident. 
The settlement payments for the defendants are to be covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
'It's unfortunate that this occurred, and I'm personally glad to see that this 
youngster is going to be helped," said Ted Howard, an attorney representing the 
Ingardias. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think my clients had any responsibility. It was such a tragic 
thing to occur that we didn't want to take the risk of losing in court. That's 
just too dangerous," Howard said.

SEA RETURNS AT LAST TO TALBERT MARSH; 
</P>
<P>
75 GATHER TO HAIL RESTORATION OF BOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A flood of ocean water poured through a breached levee in Huntington Beach on 
Friday, as part of a plan to restore a dusty, 26-acre tract to its natural 
condition as a saltwater marsh. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 supporters of marsh restoration, who gathered at the levee-opening 
ceremony, hope that the once-dusty, garbage-strewn lot -- east of Pacific Coast 
Highway and bordered by Brookhurst Street and the Santa Ana River -- will 
transform itself back into a lush marsh, where birds will again flock and 
marine life will once more thrive. 
</P>
<P>
The supporters celebrated a 6-year cooperative effort to restore Talbert Marsh 
by residents, the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, the state Coastal 
Conservancy, Caltrans and county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach conservancy, concerned about the loss of nearly 3,000 
acres salt marshes near the mouth of the Santa Ana River over the decades, 
pushed for the project and will oversee its completion. 
</P>
<P>
The undertaking proves that government agencies and citizen groups can work 
together, state Coastal Conservancy officer Pete Granell said. 
</P>
<P>
The levee opening thus far "represents the most significant milestone" of the 
project, said Gordon Smith, Huntington Beach conservancy chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Water was the main ingredient missing from the marsh until a backhoe was used 
Friday to breach the levee. "This water will flood this wetland and nourish 
it," state Fish and Game biologist Esther Burkett said. 
</P>
<P>
Two ocean-tide cycles daily will flush water full of invertebrates and fish 
into the area and help vegetation grow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll immediately start to see birds using the area," conservancy board member 
Gordon W. Smith added. 
</P>
<P>
The marsh will be good for least terns, birds that nest on nearby beaches, he 
said. "They can come over here and feed." 
</P>
<P>
But "don't expect it to look like a marsh for several years," said consulting 
biologist Barbara Massey, who will monitor the area for at least the next 2 
years. "I don't know how long it will take to be covered with dense 
vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
Plants native to marshes, such as cord grass, may have to be planted if they do 
not sprout naturally, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of restoring the marsh grew out of complaints in 1983 by Gary Gorman 
and other residents who considered the dry lot an eyesore. They started the 
Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy, which eventually received a $330,000 
grant from the state Coastal Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
At the Huntington Beach group's urging, the state group bought a 16-acre parcel 
from Caltrans. The county contributed $405,000 and use of an adjoining 10 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost of marsh construction will be about $488,000, project officials 
said. Remaining funds will pay for planning, engineering and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans representatives said Friday that the marsh will compensate for nearly 
1 acre of bird foraging ground that will be lost within the next 3 years when 
Pacific Coast Highway is widened where it crosses the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach conservancy's plans for the area include a 1.5-acre sand 
dune next to the river, a public access trail and a direct channel to the 
ocean, Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
One Huntington Beach resident, Chris Craig, said he came out to watch the 
ceremony because "the wetlands are a natural heritage." 
</P>
<P>
The marsh is a welcome change from condominium development, he said: "To see 
one small step in the other direction is encouraging."

BANDITS TAKE CASH FROM CREDIT UNION, HOSTAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A credit union was the target of an armed robbery Thursday morning when four 
men hustled customers and employees at gunpoint into a back room before fleeing 
with an undetermined amount of cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The men reached into cash drawers, safes and even the purses and wallets of 
their hostages at the Firestone Staff Credit Union at 7571 Commonwealth Ave., 
said Police Officer Rich McMillen. Two of the men were carrying weapons, 
possibly 9-millimeter or .45-caliber pistols, according to what witnesses told 
police. 
</P>
<P>
McMillen said the men were described as Latino between 25 and 30 years old. 
They were seen driving away in a white or tan four-door compact car, he said.

PUNISHMENT FOR 2 STUDENTS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three administrators are deliberating over the weekend the punishment for two 
Irvine High School students who allegedly beat and broke the leg of a fellow 
student who reportedly told police about drug sales at the school. 
</P>
<P>
A daylong disciplinary hearing was held Friday for the boys, ages 16 and 17, by 
three administrators from other schools to hear evidence about the Jan. 18 
fight on the Irvine High School campus. A school district official said the 
three will deliver their recommendation Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police report, the 17-year-old punched the 14-year-old victim 
several times around the head and face, knocking him down. The 16-year-old 
severely kicked the victim several times, according to the report. The victim 
underwent surgery for insertion of a pin in his leg, broken near the ankle, and 
has transferred to another school, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The two boys have been charged with assault with intent to commit bodily 
injury, according to the report. Those criminal charges are pending. The 
16-year-old is on probation for auto theft and also is suspected of beating a 
companion of the victim, in a separate incident, the report said. No charges 
were pressed in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation from Friday's administrative hearing could range from the 
most severe -- expulsion -- to no punishment, said Gerald Rayl, special 
assistant to the superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District. A 
recommendation for expulsion would require action by the district's school 
board, he said.

STUDENTS BACK MAN WHO STAGED STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven members of the UC Irvine Black Student Union demonstrated Friday in 
front of the Long Beach police station and called for the resignation of an 
officer involved in a recent controversy involving allegations of brutality. 
</P>
<P>
The students said they protested to support Don Jackson, a former Hawthorne 
police sergeant who secretly taped his own arrest as part of a sting operation 
in conjunction with the NBC "Today Show." Jackson has accused Long Beach police 
of using excessive force when he was arrested in the Jan. 14 incident. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was any black person that that happened to, we'd come out," student 
leader Pernell Clark, 22, said. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI students, who were joined by two from Saddleback College, formed a line 
behind a red, black and green flag -- symbolic of black nationalism -- and 
chanted: "Hey, hey. Ho, ho. Police brutality has got to go." They protested 
peacefully for about 45 minutes in front of the station at 400 W. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Their chants included one calling for the resignation of Officer Mark Dickey, 
who was involved in the altercation with Jackson. Dickey has been reassigned to 
a desk job as an auto theft detective pending the outcome of investigations of 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to raise human awareness," said Joycelyn Allen, president of UCI's 
Black Student Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We want Don Jackson to know that we support him, and we want the police to 
know we won't stand for it (brutality)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The students had hoped to meet with Long Beach Police Chief Lawrence Binkley 
but acknowledged that they had not made an appointment. About 30 minutes into 
the protest, Clark went inside the station to the front desk and asked to meet 
with Binkley. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk said that Binkley was not at the station but offered to have a sergeant 
meet with one representative from the group. Clark declined, saying, "We're in 
this together." 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Mike Hill said no one in the department would comment on the 
incident involving Jackson until various investigations are complete. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a member of the Black Student Union, said the protest was planned after 
the students saw a videotape last weekend of the Jackson arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was pulled over for a routine traffic stop on Pacific Coast Highway in 
Long Beach Jan. 14. The videotape first shows Jackson and Dickey arguing. What 
happens next is subject to interpretation. Jackson said he was pushed through a 
plate glass window and then slammed down on the hood of a police car. Dickey 
maintained the incident was accidental. The Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office and the FBI are investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the students did not know Jackson and had not talked with him before 
the demonstration. Jackson could not be reached for comment.

GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: BUTLER TURNS THE JOKES ON IRVINE'S OPPONENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Well, it's official: No more Ricky Butler fat jokes allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The former prince of pork rinds, duke of double dips, earl of eclairs, baron of 
burritos is hereby released from all heckling sessions. The wait for his weight 
to drop is complete. The Chunkster Dunkster, now at a more manageable 250 
pounds, has left the state of portly and is on his way to pleasingly plump. 
</P>
<P>
And not a moment too soon, says UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan, whose team has 
experienced a mini-resurgence with the new and improved Butler at center. 
</P>
<P>
In two months' time, Irvine has gone from being a team hell-bent on chaos to a 
group of sneakered funnels, where almost every pass eventually makes its way 
into the low post where Butler resides. Along the way, Irvine has become a 
respectable team and, at times, dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Butler has had help, mind you. When he struggled in December and January, 
guards Kevin Floyd and Rod Palmer did what they could to keep Irvine afloat. 
And now, as teams begin to drape their defenses around Butler, forwards Mike 
Doktorczyk and Jeff Herdman pump away from the three-point line, enough times 
to find themselves now ranked among the nation's leaders in long-range shooting 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
But truth be known, it is Butler who makes the difference. Logic dictates that 
short shots, like slam dunks or layups that lightly kiss the glass, have a 
better chance of going in than jumpers from press row. With that in mind, 
Mulligan has resorted to an old standby, which is the inside game. It worked 
before, with the likes of Kevin Magee and Wayne Engelstad; it works again, this 
time with Butler. 
</P>
<P>
If not, Irvine might as well save itself the cost of chartering a bus for next 
month's Big West Conference tournament at Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Strange thing is, Butler isn't tall -- 6-feet-6, tops. He isn't fast. He isn't 
a leaper. "I can jump about this high," he says, holding his thumb and 
forefinger about two inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
But he has a sense for the game and a knack for making difficult catches and 
perfect passes. He also is proud owner of a considerable bottom, which makes it 
possible for Butler to carve out space in the land of the giants. No amount of 
exercise and dieting has affected this, uh, asset. 
</P>
<P>
"People always tell me I've got a big butt," he says. "They always tell me 
that's the key to my success." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, but Mulligan likes to think it was the 40 or so pounds Butler has shed 
since summer. At least now, Butler can make it up and down the court without 
needing a Twinkie timeout. No longer is his body-fat level higher than that of 
a walrus. 
</P>
<P>
Back in December, as he sat on the bench against San Diego State, Butler 
decided something had to give, mainly his weight. "It wasn't that I ate a lot," 
he says, "it's just that I ate all the time." 
</P>
<P>
So he started staying after practice to ride a stationary bicycle. He started 
eating less. And just when he thought he had made progress, Irvine played UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
There are certain moments, so humbling and embarrassing, that you never forget 
them. The evening of Dec. 15 was one such time for Butler. 
</P>
<P>
As he took his place on the court, UNLV's David Butler introduced himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to dunk over you, fat boy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Or . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This fat guy can't hold me tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Butler didn't quite know what to do. After all, he was on the rotund 
side. And this was UNLV we were talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Butler -- Ricky, that is -- received a measure of revenge 
when Irvine upset Vegas at the Bren Center. The victory was as sweet as a slice 
of chocolate cake. And more filling, too. 
</P>
<P>
It's been quite a trip, this journey from inactivity (Butler missed his 
freshman season because of academic deficiencies) to borderline stardom. This 
is the same guy (a svelte 230 pounds at the time) who outplayed the famed J.R. 
Reid at a high school tournament, who was recruited by 19 of the top 20 teams 
that year, who was listed at or near the top of every California player 
rankings. 
</P>
<P>
J.R.? LeRon Ellis? Bryan Williams? Butler was considered their equal. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope one day I can have that back," Butler says. 
</P>
<P>
He's trying. His scoring average, almost non-existent at season's beginning, is 
steadily climbing. In Butler's past six games, he has averaged 19.3 points and 
8.3 rebounds. Over that same period, his field goal percentage is a robust 60. 
"I'm just starting to play good," he says. Just imagine if he started a season 
the way he's ending this one. Consider the possibilities of a Butler who 
arrives at 1989 summer practice with a lunch-box mentality, rather than just a 
lunch box. Already, Butler has plans.' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to come here next season as a lean, mean, fighting machine," he 
says. "I'll be ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, ha, so Butler finally sees the light. The good news is, this one isn't 
inside a refrigerator.

NEW CARS' POPULARITY, BUYERS' AFFLUENCE HAS COUNTY AUTO SHOW RIDING SMOOTHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHARLES TIGHE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Memorial Day weekend in 1985, there probably were as many people roaming 
through new car showrooms across the county as there were at the struggling 
Orange County International Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
The annual new car revue suffered from a bad location -- cramped quarters at 
the Anaheim Convention Center. Even worse, its timing was terrible -- the 
affair was held long after the new car bug would have bitten many potential 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Their appetite is whet to get a look at cars during the winter. By May, their 
mind is on the beach," said Barry Greenberg, a spokesman for the show. 
</P>
<P>
So the show's sponsors switched the date to mid-winter in 1986 and moved it to 
the Anaheim Stadium parking lot, where cars are displayed under cavernous 
tents. The exposition, now a popular event, opens today and will continue 
through Feb. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Show director Bill Schultz, who began managing the event in 1986, said the show 
also has benefited from the feverish pace of new-car buying in recent years and 
from the larger numbers of crowd-attracting cars. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 151,000 car-watchers turned out for the event. This year, the show's 
30th, promoters expect up to 180,000 to spend as much as $4.50 apiece to scope 
out 43 different car lines and to get a sneak preview of 11 not-yet-available 
1990 models. 
</P>
<P>
That's a real contrast with 1985, when fewer than 75,000 came to look at a 
paltry 19 lines of cars during the event, which ran 5 days at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 450 autos to be displayed this year were getting fresh shines 
Friday after their arrival from expositions as far away as Chicago. Among the 
showcase cars this year are many luxury models, including several introduced by 
Asian car makers who want to enter that fast-growing market. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti, models in the $35,000-and-up category 
expected to go on sale this fall, have received favorable reviews from 
consumers and auto critics since the cars had their premieres earlier this year 
in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Sportier cars from Lotus, Mazda and Chevrolet will be on display, too, as will 
two "concept" cars -- models that are not (and perhaps may never be) ready for 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Promoters said the exceptional number of 1990 "winners" have brought record 
crowds at expositions across the country this year. The Chicago Auto Show, 
which ends Sunday, has attracted larger crowds than it did in 1982, when a 
record 988,000 people turned out, said Ross Kelsey, a show consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance topped the half-million mark for the first time at the Los Angeles 
auto show last month. San Diego promoters expect 60,000 for their exposition 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowds are the result of the customer being over-choiced," said Jeremy 
Anwyl, president of USP Automotive Advertising, an Irvine agency that 
specializes in retail car advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers will never make it to all the dealerships to see the cars they'd 
like," Anwyl said. "They'd also be too intimidated to try." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers need not worry about getting a high-pressured sales pitch at the 
Orange County show. And sightseers can talk to the manufacturers 
representatives on hand to measure responses to their cars. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, consumers may attend sessions on car buying, one of which is a 
seminar sponsored by the Chrysler Corp. Women's Advisory Board on making 
purchases based on family needs. 
</P>
<P>
One traditional car-show cliche will remain: female models clad in the latest 
bathing suits on display alongside the new cars. 
</P>
<P>
Local car experts say the crowds at the Orange County show are far different 
from the ones at shows elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Status Seeking Cited 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles had many more people, but they didn't have as many buyers as our 
show," said Jim Upp, executive director of the Orange County Motor Car Dealers 
Assn., whose membership includes 120 of the 138 new-car dealers in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Keeping up with the Joneses is more prevalent here in Orange County than it is 
in L.A., so people are always looking to buy new cars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers also said that they can put expensive cars on display at the 
Orange County show without worrying about shocking consumers with the price 
stickers. 
</P>
<P>
For Joe Cappy, a vice president of the Chrysler Jeep-Eagle division, Orange 
County is one place where he must try harder. In the Midwest, his company's 
vehicles are sales leaders, but here Toyota and Honda are the traditional 
kings. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot more buying decisions will probably be made here at the show. These 
people have a pretty good idea of what they are after," said Cappy, who arrived 
here from Detroit this week to promote his division's vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The difference in what will sell in Orange County was one factor that led to 
the decline of the show in the early 1980s, promoters said. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, we had Eastern promoters pitching the show with Eastern ideas," Upp 
said. "They loved hype. The Orange County car buyer doesn't buy hype." 
</P>

RANCH MARKET FOUNDER IN BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Hubbard, founder of the Irvine Ranch Farmers Market chain, has filed for 
personal bankruptcy, listing total debts of about $2,645,000. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, shows 
assets of $7,900 in cash. "He's got his clothes and his furniture," said 
Hubbard's bankruptcy lawyer, William C. Starrett II. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's 12-store, upscale grocery chain filed for protection from creditors 
in July, listing liabilities of $17.5 million. The Costa Mesa-based chain was 
bought in September by a group of investors led by Daniel Bobroff, owner of 
Chalet Gourmet in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
According to Starrett, creditors are likely to get "zero" from Hubbard. "It's 
all over. They're going to have to get (anything recovered) out of Irvine 
Ranch," Starrett said, because Hubbard "put everything he owned into the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard could not be reached for comment Friday. He is managing the chain's 
Costa Mesa store. MARY ANN GALANTE

INGRAM BRINGS OVER 2 EXECUTIVES FOR MERGED COMPANIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ingram Industries, the Nashville-based company that is acquiring Micro D in 
Santa Ana, has appointed two of its executives as vice chairman and chief 
financial officer of the combined firms. 
</P>
<P>
David Blumstein, president of Ingram Industries' computer distribution business 
in Buffalo, N.Y., will become Micro D's vice chairman. He succeeds Harold L. 
Clark, who has resigned and plans to leave the company May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Briggs, chief operating officer and executive vice president of Ingram 
Computer, was named chief financial officer and senior vice president. He 
replaces Godfred P. Otuteye, who also resigned and plans to leave the firm 
March 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Industries is acquiring the 41% of Micro D's stock that it doesn't 
already own for $43.9 million. Ingram is merging its Buffalo distribution unit 
with Micro D, the nation's largest wholesaler of personal computer products. 
</P>
<P>
Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy will continue as chairman and chief executive of the 
merged company. No name for the merged company has been chosen yet. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said the company is searching for a president and chief operating officer 
from outside Micro D and Ingram.

DESIGNER-ARTIST LEON KAWECKI FASHIONS COMMEMORATIVES FOR PLEASURE

<P>
To mark the 500th anniversary of the birth of Polish astronomer Nicolaus 
Copernicus in 1973, he designed a commemorative poster issued by a chapter of 
the Polish American Congress, another poster commissioned by the Museum of 
Science and Industry in Chicago and a commemorative bronze-cast plaque for the 
Griffith Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
To salute the 175th anniversary of the birth of Polish composer Frederic Chopin 
in 1985, he designed and personally issued a commemorative medal in silver and 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
To honor Pope John Paul II, he designed a commemorative medal issued by the 
Polish American Numismatic Assn. and painted a stunning oil portrait of the 
former Cardinal of Krakow that now hangs in the library at Loyola Marymount 
University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And to do his part for the American Bicentennial, he designed and personally 
issued a commemorative medal featuring George Washington flanked by his fellow 
"freedom founders," the Polish-born Generals Thaddeus Kosciuszko and Casimir 
Pulaski. 
</P>
<P>
Given all that -- and that is just a sampler -- it would seem only a matter of 
time before Polish-born artist and designer Leon Kawecki of Garden Grove would 
get around to creating an artistic tribute to one of Poland's greatest 
actresses of all time: Madame Helena Modjeska, a Polish emigrant and pioneer 
Orange County resident who became the leading Shakespearean actress in the 
United States in the 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioned last year by the California chapter of the Polish-American 
Historical Assn., the limited-edition commemorative medal that Kawecki has 
designed captures both Modjeska the woman and her century-old house on her 
estate in Santiago Canyon, which the actress named Arden after the Forest of 
Arden in Shakespeare's "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
"In Poland, she is considered the greatest lady of the theater," said Kawecki, 
who retains a rich Polish accent even after 38 years in this country. "There 
was no one greater than Modjeska. In Poland, we say, 'Mode-ju-yev-ska."' 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish-American Historical Assn. plans to issue the high-relief, 2 
3/4-inch-diameter medal in April. (It will cost $35 in bronze, $230 in silver. 
For details, call the Polish-American Historical Assn. at (213) 670-1090.) 
</P>
<P>
Proceeds from the medal will help pay for the publication of an updated version 
of the nonprofit organization's 1977 book, "Polish-Americans in California and 
Who's Who." The new book will be dedicated to Modjeska. 
</P>
<P>
"She is a towering figure of the Polish community of our past," said chapter 
president Henrietta Simons, who has seen Kawecki's charcoal drawings for the 
medal and deems it "gorgeous." 
</P>
<P>
"It is so striking," she said. "I like Leon's work, but I love this medal. He 
really, to me, captured her." 
</P>
<P>
The obverse side of the medal features a portrait of the actress with long, 
flowing hair. Using artistic license, Kawecki has her wearing a broad-brimmed, 
Western-style hat with an art nouveau diamond-shaped decoration on it that 
matches her earrings. The bottom of the medal is adorned with the coat-of-arms 
of Krakow, Modjeska's birthplace, which is flanked with laurel leaves. The 
circular legend reads: "Helena Modjeska -- First Lady of the Theater." 
</P>
<P>
The reverse side of the medal shows Modjeska's celebrated Orange County home 
surrounded by lush vegetation. In the distance are the twin peaks of Saddleback 
Mountain (Modjeska and Santiago), and in the center of the upper part is a 
stylized mask, symbol of the theater arts. The legend on top reads "Pioneer 
Actress of Two Continents -- Born in Krakow, Poland Oct. 12, 1840. Died at 
Balboa, California, April 8, 1909." And on the bottom: "Arden -- Modjeska's 
Home in Santiago Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge of designing a commemorative medal, according to Kawecki, is to 
convey an historically important event in a condensed space. A commemorative 
medal, he said, is art in miniature, "so therefore certain elements have to be 
exaggerated to bring out the beauty of the medal." 
</P>
<P>
As is the case with his nine other commemorative medals honoring Polish 
historical figures, Kawecki donated his time and work in designing the Modjeska 
medal for the Polish-American Historical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to donate something of my own to Modjeska," said Kawecki, a longtime 
association member. "It gives me a specific pleasure to produce a token of my 
own admiration for a Polish emigre who has contributed something not only to 
Poland but the world at large." 
</P>
<P>
To research the Polish actress and her home, Kawecki consulted with Modjeska 
historian Ellen K. Lee of Laguna Beach and viewed old photographs and 
paintings. 
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, visit Modjeska's house, which is being restored by the 
county as part of a 14.5-acre historical park. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I'm ashamed," he confessed in a mock whisper, then boomed, "I'm so 
occupied, my friend! Every day I have something else." 
</P>
<P>
As Western region art director for Meade Packaging in Buena Park, Kawecki 
spends the workweek designing packages for 7-Up, Pepsi, RC Cola and various 
fruit juice and water companies. 
</P>
<P>
That, he said, is "my bread and butter. Everything else is just for my pleasure 
and for my ambition to release my creative energies." 
</P>
<P>
His Garden Grove apartment is testament to his considerable creative energies. 
</P>
<P>
The living room is a virtual art gallery, its walls filled with strikingly 
colorful oil paintings that he has executed in a variety of styles. The spare 
bedroom that serves as his studio is packed with examples of his medals, 
posters and some 20 commemorative envelopes he designed for philatelic 
societies to commemorate everything from the Berlin airlift and the American 
Bicentennial to the millennium of Christianity in Poland and the 100th 
anniversary of the death of Chopin. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki is now working on the design for a commemorative medal that will be 
presented to VIPs at a banquet at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel before the 54th 
annual Pulaski Parade in New York City next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Mind you," he noted while showing a visitor his work, "I do this in my spare 
time -- Saturdays, Sundays and evenings. I'm a very compulsive man." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Kawecki's creative time is spent pacing around his studio, or having a 
cup of coffee -- all as mental preparation for sitting down at his drawing 
table. 
</P>
<P>
For him, it's time spent "trying to embrace the spirit of the muse of the fine 
arts." And when he does embrace the muse, he exclaimed, "I embrace it as if it 
is ecstasy!" 
</P>
<P>
The son of fish and produce merchants, Kawecki has been embracing the muse 
since he was a boy growing up in Chojnice, a small Polish town near Gdansk. 
</P>
<P>
At 8, he began studying with one of his parents' customers, a well-known German 
artist who ran a private art school in Kawecki's hometown. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, he entered an all-Poland scholastic competition, winning a top medal for 
his watercolor landscape featuring his town's centuries-old church. 
</P>
<P>
And at 14, he became the youngest student ever admitted to the Academy of Fine 
Arts in Poznan, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki's artistic ambitions, however, were derailed in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
Having just completed a cross-country bicycle trip, he was about to begin his 
post-graduate studies at the art academy when Germany invaded Poland on Sept. 
1. Kawecki, along with other civilians fleeing the advancing German army, 
linked up with Polish Army troops on a road heading east toward the Russian 
border. "We felt the Russians were our saviors," he said. But on Sept. 17, the 
Russians invaded Poland and on the 23rd, Kawecki and other civilians were taken 
prisoner along with the soldiers. "No one in the West knew the Russians and 
Germans had signed a mutual military pact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After spending time in a succession of Russian prisoner-of-war camps, Kawecki 
was sent to a camp in Siberia. Noting that "everyone in such trying 
circumstances tries to make his existence as good as possible," he let it be 
known that he was an artist. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians always admired the arts, be it music, literature or the fine 
arts, and they took me as their own," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki was provided with office space and, using hospital linens for his 
canvases and paints obtained on the black market, he spent his days copying old 
Russian masters for the Russian officers. 
</P>
<P>
"Periodically, when we went from one camp to another, the Russians, of course, 
didn't know who I was and it took me a while to again get them to know I'm an 
artist," he recalled. "So I worked in brigades, a detachment of prisoners of 
war. There were about 12 people to a brigade, and they sent you to a factory 
here and there or into the forest to cut wood. I stayed with them for a while, 
until I got noticed again (as an artist)." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he also spoke Russian helped. "You have the immediate 
communication with your captor: You speak his language -- you reach his spirit, 
you see -- and it alleviates so much of the hostility." 
</P>
<P>
After Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 and the Russians joined the 
Allies, Kawecki joined the Polish Army under British command. He served in 
campaigns in North Africa and Italy and was wounded three times. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, he returned home to Poland, but his stay was brief. "My family 
wasn't there anymore because they were afraid of the Russians," he said. "They 
went to Germany and Austria and France." 
</P>
<P>
He followed suit, living mostly in Germany and traveling extensively in Austria 
and Greece. He found jobs working in graphic arts and took whatever other jobs 
he could find. He also resumed his fine arts studies, a practice he continued 
after arriving in the United States in 1951. With a laugh, he said, "I was 
never done with school. The last school I had was 8 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving in the United States, Kawecki initially lived with a Polish 
family in Cleveland. Unable to get a job in the graphic arts, he took the first 
job he could find: a punch-press and brake-press operator for a 
steel-manufacturing company. Evenings he attended classes at John Huntington 
Polytechnic Institute. "I never worked as hard as my first years in America: I 
wanted to go to school, I wanted to accomplish so much." 
</P>
<P>
After a year, he moved to Pittsburgh, where he landed a job as a packaging 
designer for Fuller Label and Box Co. At night, he attended the Pittsburgh Art 
Institute and Carnegie Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki, who was married in 1953 and became an American citizen in 1956, landed 
his job at Meade Packaging in 1960. Despite his success in packaging design -- 
he has won two major international awards in his field -- the divorced father 
of four children never lost his desire to make a contribution in fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
"My ambition was always to be a recognized artist," he said. "In fact, on my 
application when I came to Meade Packaging it states: 'What is your ultimate 
goal?' And I wrote: 'It is to be a recognized artist.' " 
</P>
<P>
And so he is. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his paintings are in museums in Germany, Poland and the United States. 
And his Bicentennial commemorative medal, for one, is in more than 30 major 
collections, including the Smithsonian Institution Museum and the private 
collections of former Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Kawecki said his extracurricular artistic endeavors are not only motivated by 
his "love for the arts" but also, through his Polish themes, his desire to 
educate people about Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"The West is very poor at acknowledging, or even having the knowledge of, what 
contributions Poland has made in the world in the sciences, the arts and 
history in general," he said. "For instance, for the American Bicentennial, 
there were many books issued crediting many generals for the victories in 
different areas. However, there was not even mention in some of them of the 
great contributions of Kosciuszko and Pulaski, who were great heroes of many 
battles." 
</P>
<P>
Although he declines to say which medal is his favorite, he has a particular 
affinity for his medal commemorating the birth of Chopin, who also happens to 
be his favorite composer. "His music," he said, "has such great longing for 
Poland; he wakens up the sentiments and all the compassion for our motherland." 
</P>
<P>
In his own way, Kawecki expresses his own sentiments for the motherland. 
</P>
<P>
Through his art, he said, "I want to pay homage to the country of my birth."

JOSEPH N. BELL: DEAR LETTER-WRITERS: SOMEONE OUT THERE REALLY IS LISTENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two weekends ago at UC Irvine's University Club, I dropped in on the 4th Annual 
Great American Write In, which was sponsored by a group called Women For: 
Orange County. Several dozen organizations representing a wide variety of 
causes were on hand with literature and representatives. They provided 
attendees with information on causes, which participants, in turn, translated 
into letters to their elected public officials. 
</P>
<P>
It was a kind of shop-window democracy, and the whole scene was impressive. The 
weather was terrible, with pouring rain most of the morning, but the meeting 
was jammed with people, and it was sometimes hard to find a letter-writing spot 
at the several dozen large round tables provided for that purpose. The causes 
represented were heavily environmental, social, feminist and -- for Orange 
County, anyway -- liberal. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned 
Parenthood were welcome guests here -- but so were the Gray Panthers, the 
Laguna Greenbelt, the League of Women Voters, the Mental Health Assn. and 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
I shopped the tables and found that the hottest issues were Gov. Deukmejian's 
dropping of family planning from his budget, the protection of choice for women 
in abortion, and the banning of the sale of semiautomatic guns. But there were 
also many letters being written on environmental issues (high school kids, who 
were well represented, were heavy in this area), more funding for mental 
health, attacking illiteracy, and providing shelter for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The guest speaker was Anne Summers, the new editor of Ms. magazine, who came 
over from Australia when Rupert Murdoch bought Ms., then joined a group that 
recently bought the magazine from him. I was startled to find that Orange 
County's reputation had even penetrated Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Summers told me that she was "astonished" by this turnout since in her 
quarters, Orange County is seen "as a place of immense wealth and special 
conservatism. It's marvelous to see that you have so many women here working 
for a better world." 
</P>
<P>
It was marvelous, but to a certified skeptic who has spent too many years 
hanging around power centers, the question kept intruding: Does all this energy 
translate into anything at the other end? 
</P>
<P>
Since many of the letters were being sent to state Sen. John Seymour 
(R-Anaheim), I decided to call him and find out. The call turned out to be 
instructive. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said emphatically that letters from constituents are an integral part 
of the legislative process and an enormous help to him. He cited two areas in 
which constituent mail is especially effective: "Letters provide ammunition for 
me when I go to argue a position in committee meetings," he said. "And if I 
haven't made up my mind on how I'm going to vote, the mail is a tremendous 
help, especially on issues I don't know much about. It makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
I asked him for examples of issues on which the mail had actually influenced 
his vote. He didn't hesitate long. "When a California child goes to school, he 
is tested for curvature of the spine. A bill came before us that would allow 
chiropractors to perform this test. It was strongly opposed by medical doctors, 
and initially I agreed with the doctors and voted against the bill in 
committee. Then I learned from the mail that poured in that librarians and 
football coaches and school nurses are allowed to do this test, so I saw no 
reason why a chiropractor shouldn't. I changed my vote as a result of that 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
"I also changed my vote on a bill that required helmets for motorcyclists. I 
was against it 2 years ago and for it last year, mostly because of information 
contained in the mail I received." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour described almost lovingly the computer system that has been set up in 
his office to handle letters. "Every letter and phone call gets an answer," he 
said proudly, "and often multiple answers. When the letter refers to specific 
legislation, we send progress reports to the letter writer as the bill moves. 
And when it is voted on, I tell them how I voted and why. I've had lots of 
letters back from people who didn't agree with me but appreciated my 
follow-up." 
</P>
<P>
He said that another way the mail helps him is to give him varying points of 
view and their sources. "If I feel strongly about an issue," he said, "I'll 
look at a computer list of letter writers taking the other side. I'll call 
several, ask why they feel that way and talk it over with them. This helps me 
clarify my thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Although Seymour insists he sees every letter that comes in, the one category 
that gets the least attention is mass-produced mail. He's getting a fair amount 
of that -- "18 inches of letters," he says -- on legislation now pending to ban 
the sale of assault rifles. He doesn't know how the count is shaping up, but he 
does know that individually produced letters have the greatest impact on him. 
</P>
<P>
And that's the one piece of advice he would pass on to those who write their 
representatives in public office: "The letters that move me the most are those 
that are written in your own words in which you express what is clearly your 
own strong feelings. Those are the ones that cause the wheels to go around for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
I don't think that the people writing letters so earnestly at the Write In 
needed to hear that. But I did.

RED MEASLES BREAKING OUT IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CICCHESE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cases of red measles in Orange County will set a 12-year record this year if 
they continue at the current rate, the director of immunization for the county 
Health Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gerald Wagner said 26 cases have been reported so far. At that rate, he 
said, the cases could outnumber the record set in 1977 of 397. 
</P>
<P>
"Cases continue to be reported throughout the county," Wagner said. "The first 
cases seemed to be just in the Santa Ana and Garden Grove area." 
</P>
<P>
County records show that there were 109 cases in 1988, up from 12 cases in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transmitted Easily 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said red measles, also known as German measles, is transmitted as easily 
as the common cold. Symptoms include a high fever, a "barking cough," nasal 
congestion and a red rash over the entire body. The illness usually lasts 7 to 
10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Red measles, which is more serious than rubella measles, can result in 
complications that commonly include pneumonia. In extreme cases with children, 
there is a potential of serious ear infection which could cause hearing loss, 
or brain infections which may result in learning disabilities, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious complication with the recent outbreak has been pneumonia, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Kerin, nurse manager at Childrens Hospital of Orange County, said the 
hospital has had had a significant increase in cases of red measles. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to hardly see any but we've been picking up a couple a week since 
December," Kerin said. 
</P>
<P>
She said four children have been hospitalized at the hospital with pneumonia 
resulting from red measles, and three have since been released. The fourth was 
admitted last week and is in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
The county Health Department advises all adults and children who have never 
been vaccinated against measles to get vaccinations. The department has lowered 
the minimum age for vaccinations to 12 months. Previously the minimum 
recommended age was 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
Vaccinations are not effective for children under a year old, Wagner said. 
Children that young who have been exposed to red measles can be given a gamma 
globulin shot to prevent the illness.

In a Feb. 18 story about an outbreak of red measles in Orange County, The Times 
erroneously said the disease is the same as German measles. In fact, red 
measles is more severe, with symptoms of high fever, barking cough and rash 
lasting 7 to 10 days.
