RICHARD EDER: IN MURDOCH COUNTRY, THE GODS WEAR TWEED; 
</P>
<P>
THE MESSAGE TO THE PLANET BY IRIS MURDOCH (VIKING: $22.95; 563 PP.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ground in Iris Murdoch's novels perpetually shifts beneath us. At one 
moment, her clutch of assorted English intellectuals and artistic types are 
engaged in perfectly ordinary exercises of speculation, lust, ambition, greed 
and depressiveness. At the next, an aura of the supernatural falls upon them, 
as if the old gods were alive and wore cardigans and good shoes. 
</P>
<P>
These characters are commonplace if snobbish, clever if long-winded, we think; 
and then, suddenly: No, they are quicker and more spectral than life. The 
humdrum declares itself magic, and the magic promptly declares itself humdrum. 
As in a roller-coaster -- often with the same sense of being lifted out of our 
own gravity -- we never quite know where we are. Except, and unmistakably, in 
Murdoch country. 
</P>
<P>
Her painters, lawyers, academics, failed clergymen, musicians and writers tend 
to be on the verges of middle age. They are uneasy or morose and, despite their 
talents and comforts, subject to an acedia close to spiritual death. Their 
women seem subdued, but they are accumulators of the electricity that builds up 
in the oppressive air, and they can flash out like lightning. 
</P>
<P>
Into this uneasy stasis moves a guru-like figure, a man of enigmatic 
intellectual and moral force, an enchanter. He provokes thunder storms, 
displacements, violence, wild leaps, odd changes; and by the time the book 
ends, at least some of these high-strung people will find themselves upended. 
It is a kind of conversion: Like so many New Testament Sauls, they are knocked 
off their mounts, though when they re-mount, they usually find themselves not 
St. Pauls, but Sauls still. 
</P>
<P>
"The Message to the Planet" follows the pattern. Marcus Vallar was a 
mathematical prodigy, then a painter, then a linguist searching for the roots 
of a universal language. He fascinated and unsettled those he met. Vallar 
alternately helped and quarreled with Jack, whose brilliant painting career he 
inspired. His corrosive questioning led Gildas to lose his faith and quit the 
priesthood. He made an ardent disciple out of Ludens, a scholar, only to savage 
him and drive him away. He put a curse on Patrick, an Irish poet. And then he 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
When the book starts, years later, Patrick is dying of a mysterious disease. 
Jack, Gildas and Ludens speculate that Vallar's curse may be responsible. 
Ludens, still worshipful, searches and finds him living in a country cottage, 
aged, paranoid and scribbling what Ludens is certain must be a mighty though 
obscure philosophical work. 
</P>
<P>
Ludens brings Vallar back to London along with the latter's Gypsy-like 
daughter, Irina. Vallar climbs into bed with Patrick and embraces him. It is a 
comically awkward scene; Vallar seems half-hearted and fumbling about it, 
almost as if he didn't really know what to do and were simply humoring Ludens. 
Yet Patrick promptly recovers. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the book concerns Ludens' effort to be disciple to a figure he has 
decided is somewhere between Spinoza and Christ. Murdoch leaves it open as to 
whether Vallar is an authentic magus or a burnt-out, half-mad old man. Ludens' 
need to find a master endows Vallar with a prophetic glow, one that includes 
Irina, with whom he falls loftily in love. 
</P>
<P>
To him, she is the magician's daughter, and touched with his magic. In fact -- 
or almost fact, granting Murdoch her ambiguities -- she regards her father as 
"barmy." She places him in an expensive sanitarium in the countryside, takes 
care of him in a cottage on the grounds, and waits for him to die so she can go 
off and have fun. 
</P>
<P>
Ludens' need to believe makes his attendance upon Vallar a quixotic quest that 
is both goofy and deadly serious. He brings notebooks and an expensive 
fountain-pen; he asks the old man whole lists of philosophical questions, all 
in an effort to get the great work out. He takes Vallar's resistance, his 
quirks and oddities, as signs of inspiration. And he is overwhelmed and shoved 
aside when a band of New Age pilgrims, on their way to Stonehenge, invades the 
sanitarium and camps outside the cottage, waiting for revelations by charisma 
instead of by the book. 
</P>
<P>
Comedy entangled in mystery, fraud indistinguishable from saintliness are the 
elements of this, as of previous Murdoch conundrums. Jack comes down to visit, 
along with his wife and mistress, both of whom live in the same house with him 
and battle each other in highly arcane fashion. So do Gildas, Patrick, a rabbi, 
a priest, and other assorted characters. Each works upon his or her entirely 
tangential obsessions. A tangency that doesn't quite touch is Murdoch's pattern 
of people's relations to each other and to the universe. Across the 
infinitesimal gap, her sparks fly. 
</P>
<P>
If "Message" has the complexity, the wonderfully unexpected talk, the fey and 
jarring balances and imbalances of Murdoch's other recent novels, it is 
something of a falling-off. Energy is lacking. There is lethargy in it despite 
the wit. The characters say interesting things, but they are not particularly 
interesting or distinctive in themselves. The enchanter figure, this time, is 
more vague than exciting. 
</P>
<P>
But as always, Murdoch's itchy intellectual seekers and slobs create a world 
that is entirely artificial and yet infinitely inhabitable. It draws us in, and 
when we finish one of her books, we miss it. Each new book resembles the 
others, and yet a Murdoch fan is glad to be back. 
</P>
<P>
It's rather like being a Wodehouse fan. You know everybody. And a Murdoch 
enchanter, to tell the truth, is a kind of Jeeves. Her highbrow Bertie 
Woosters, having made a terrible mess of things and flapping out of control, 
are hopelessly stuck. The enchanter arrives, gets them going, and in his 
drastic and disruptive way, restores a sort of order. He is not as unflappable 
as Jeeves, but he is as mysterious, as unquestionable, and quite often as 
funny.

Those who so righteously protest against abortion ought to see (Dr. James T.) 
McMahon as having a just cause -- to save lives, not take them. Surely these 
women are victims, and it does no good to try and save the unborn until the 
living are saved first. 
</P>
<P>
If third-trimester abortions nauseate us (as they should) we should be even 
more shocked by the reasons they occur. 
</P>
<P>
With the prices McMahon charges, he's certainly no saint, but at least he 
offers hope to the desperate. His assertion that the soul of a person enters 
the body when the fetus is accepted by the mother is very telling. Women who go 
to him don't want the babies and will do anything to get rid of them. We all 
know that abortions will take place with or without a doctor, but with a 
doctor, at least one person survives. 
</P>
<P>
Saving human life must start with saving the women who will do what sickens us. 
Until these women are given souls themselves by finding acceptance, lives will 
continue to be lost, and abortions will continue to cycle generation after 
generation.

The author did not clearly point out that women such as "Agnes" would decide to 
be sterilized and have no children at all if not for the availability of 
abortion to detect a fetus with a severe defect like the one her baby had. This 
allows her to have a baby who won't die. 
</P>
<P>
Babies with Tay-Sachs disease are born normal but start to go downhill at about 
age 1, and all of them die by age 4. And babies born without a brain 
(anencephaly) die within a week of being born. Military hospitals will not do 
abortions even in these cases. Women have to go elsewhere for an abortion or 
have the baby, and the parents and child suffer the consequences.

Many of us who oppose abortion have not been led to our position by religious 
indoctrination or coldhearted indifference to the plight of women in crisis. 
Rather, a basic understanding of the development of the pre-born human, and 
what happens to him or her during an abortion, leads to an unsettling 
conclusion: This is a primitive and Draconian procedure at any stage, 
especially during the second and third trimester. There have to be more humane 
solutions to these wrenching problems than dismemberment and disposal of human 
life on such a colossal scale.

Feathers in the yard this morning.

My cat?

<P>
Or the two black strays, 
</P>
<P>
ominously staring with orange eyes

<P>
I hear them at night

shush of branches, squeals and shrieks,

<P>
Artist couple rented around the 
</P>
<P>
corner last month. Were ecstatic 
</P>
<P>
about this primitive place. 
</P>
<P>
She came over one morning, 
</P>
<P>
arm bandaged, boyfriend 
</P>
<P>
stern-faced, sucking air through teeth, 
</P>
<P>
she said, "My cat went belly up, 
</P>
<P>
no animal is supposed to attack another 
</P>
<P>
belly up. Those blacks are vicious. 
</P>
<P>
Ought to be put to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Her Siamese crossed Blacks' territory, 
</P>
<P>
she came upon them, kicked one Black, 
</P>
<P>
and it scratched her arm in defense. 
</P>
<P>
They moved out month after they moved in, 
</P>
<P>
truck loaded with paintbrushes, canvasses, 
</P>
<P>
cameras, to find another primitive place, 
</P>
<P>
tranquil as a pond in autumn evening 
</P>
<P>
where golden-tipped wheat leans, 
</P>
<P>
place with no problems, no animal 
</P>
<P>
attacks another, where gentle folk 
</P>
<P>
are as groomed as heirloom porcelain, 
</P>
<P>
where there is no pollution, no drugs, 
</P>
<P>
no world gone belly-up 
</P>
<P>
the rest of us are trying to heal. 
</P>
<P>
After they left, Antonio and I 
</P>
<P>
sat on the patio, talking how he 
</P>
<P>
and Blacks played hide-n-seek, 
</P>
<P>
how he crouched in cool cracks 
</P>
<P>
reaching his arm under boards 
</P>
<P>
by the fence, they squirmed under, 
</P>
<P>
pawing at him playfully, their claws 
</P>
<P>
tucked in their furry mitten-paws 
</P>
<P>
safely.

To begin with, I am a loyal fan of NBC and I watch it faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite days are Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. However, the network 
recently moved "Dear John" from Thursdays to Wednesdays to make room for the 
new comedy, "Grand." Why they call it "Grand" is beyond me. After two viewings, 
I was hoping for a grand finale.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: FACING HISTORY BY GUY C. MCELROY (BEDFORD ARTS/THE 
CORCORAN GALLERY OF ART: $50; 141 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Slave or freedman, servant or member of the middle class, minstrel performer 
or wartime hero, ridiculous stereotype or forceful leader," writes Guy C. 
McElroy in "Facing History," "the ways that America's leading visual artists 
have portrayed the African-American . . . form an index that reveals how the 
majority of American society felt about its black neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
"Facing History," the catalogue to an exhibit now at the Corcoran Gallery in 
Washington, D.C., presents works by approximately 80 artists, the vast majority 
white, who portrayed African-Americans between 1710 and 1940. In his "reading" 
of the works, McElroy argues that white society's attitudes about the 
African-American's place can be identified in the artists' work as well as in 
the reception the artists met in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the works make overtly political statements, like the scene from the 
New Orleans slave market (reproduced on Page 1 of Book Review), Paul Cadmus' 
brutal "To the Lynching" or the drawing of fugitive slave Margaret Garner, who, 
on being apprehended in 1856, tried to kill her children rather than see them 
returned to slavery. In other works, McElroy makes his argument through an 
analysis of the style of depiction. He notes, for example, the fine detailing 
and crude sketching of the respective white and black figures in an 1813 
domestic scene by John Lewis Krimmel. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy's text also discusses contemporary controversies. Winslow Homer's "A 
Visit From the Old Mistress," which portrayed the difficult relationship 
between former slaves and masters after Emancipation, was attacked on two 
fronts: by whites for its frank subject and by blacks for the depiction of the 
former slaves as poor. "There are plenty of well-dressed Negroes if (Homer) 
would but look for them," one critic noted. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy's overt ideological intent inevitably results in occasional 
overstatement. But quibbles over the author's scholarly method seem irrelevant 
next to McElroy's observation about the enduring power of the visual image: 
"Depictions of black people can no longer rely on gross distortions of 
physiognomy or character to achieve racially motivated humor, but the symbolic 
power of visual images remains insidious. Jim Crow, Uncle Tom, Mammy, the Comic 
Darkey and Zip Coon no longer dominate images of African-Americans in painting 
and sculpture, but their ghosts live on in a host of popular mediums, most 
notably in the violence of action serials and the stereotyped behavior of 
television sitcoms." McElroy intends, by exposing the stereotypes conveyed in 
visual images, to free people from their power -- and thus from the confines of 
racial prejudice.

Photo, "The Banjo Lesson," by Henry Ossawa Tanner, 1893, from "Facing History." 
Tanner is widely regarded as the most talented African-American artist of the 
19th Century. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts under Thomas 
Eakins, with whom he became lifelong friends. After a failed venture in the 
late 1880s to run a photography studio catering to Atlanta's affluent black 
middle class, Tanner emigrated to France, where he lived until his death in 
1937. February is Black History Month. ; Photo, Eyre Crowe, "Slave Market in 
Richmond, Virginia," 1852-1853. Crowe (1824-1910) was a British artist who 
served as amanuensis to the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray and 
accompanied him on a lecture tour of the United States in 1852-1853. From Guy 
C. McElroy, "Facing History: The Black Image in American Art 1710-1940."

I'd like to call attention to an underrated actor, Joe Penny. In movies from 
"Deathmoon" to "The Operation," from guest-starring roles in "Vega$" and "Matt 
Houston" to co-starring roles in "Riptide" and "Jake and the Fatman," he has 
proven himself a versatile and accomplished actor. Some roles may not have been 
the choicest but that has never seemed to tarnish his passion for giving it his 
best.

MY HIGH SCHOOL classmate Jerry Luboviski, who was later my city editor at the 
San Diego Journal and the Los Angeles Daily News, both now defunct, has written 
to ask how we handled it when our sons wrote home for money.

<P>
Luboviski said he was prompted to recall how he and his wife, Bonnie, had dealt 
with this situation by a story in The Times on Dr. Benjamin Spock.

Spock said that his mother got him to write when he was away at school by

Luboviski recalls that he and his wife had the same problem of one-way 
correspondence when their son, Mike, was away at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, Bonnie sent him a terse note: 'No letter from you. No money from me.' 
It worked, too. Were your kids away at school, and did a similar situation 
arise? I wonder what leverage other parents used." 
</P>
<P>
I remember an imaginary correspondence between a son and father that was a kind 
of joke in the 1930s. It probably came from the magazine College Humor: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Dad. No mon. No fun. Your Son." 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Son. How sad. Too bad. Your Dad." 
</P>
<P>
Keeping that in mind, I was always hesitant to wire or telephone (collect) my 
father for money when I was away. But sometimes the need for cash became 
urgent. I remember that, once, when I was in Honolulu on the beach, I wired my 
father for money to come home on. 
</P>
<P>
"Need two hundred dollars." (At that time you could buy a one-way ticket on the 
S.S. Lurline, cabin class, from Honolulu to San Francisco for $200.) I signed 
the wire DILLINGER, referring to the notorious John Dillinger, a bank robber 
and murderer who had been the FBI's Public Enemy No. 1 and had been shot to 
death in front of a Chicago theater after "the woman in red" put the finger on 
him. His name was synonymous with lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
My father sent the money with a message: "Who's Dillinger?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite his question, I was sure he understood the significance of Dillinger as 
a confession of guilt. Otherwise, why would he have sent the money to me? 
</P>
<P>
I realized later it was a good thing Dillinger was already dead or the FBI 
would have been on my neck. 
</P>
<P>
My most excruciating appeal for money, though, came a few years later, when I 
was married and working for United Press at Sacramento in the Capitol Building. 
My wife and I had taken a weekend holiday in San Francisco, staying at the Manx 
Hotel. Before it became time to check out, I realized I did not have enough 
money to pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
I telephoned my sister in Los Angeles. No answer. I telephoned my UP boss in 
Sacramento. No answer. I couldn't think of anyone I knew in San Francisco. We 
didn't have a checking account. Finally, my wife remembered that a man who had 
once been sweet on her was now living in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
We found him in the telephone book. He was at home. I explained our 
predicament. He came to the hotel. We had a drink. He loaned me $20. That was a 
lot of money in those days. 
</P>
<P>
We paid our bill and took the train back to Sacramento. I didn't own a car. 
When I could, I paid the $20 back. 
</P>
<P>
That couldn't happen today. We would simply put it on a credit card. No 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, young people away from home today don't get in money scrapes. They 
don't have to telephone or wire home for money. They put it on their credit 
cards. It isn't hard to guess who pays the bills. 
</P>
<P>
There is an American Express ad on TV that shows a fond father sending his 
daughter off to college with a gift of her very own credit card. His smiling 
face reflects the confidence he feels that everything will be OK with her. She 
will want for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The affluence of our times is demonstrated even more by a TV ad showing a 
father and mother seeing their daughter off to college in her brand new, very 
own Oldsmobile. It goes without saying that she will also have a credit card to 
buy gas and oil for it. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in college, the only girl I knew who was lucky enough to have her 
very own car was a wealthy doctor's daughter. It was a red convertible, and she 
was something to see when she rode through the campus in it. But for me, she 
was unattainable. 
</P>
<P>
If I were in college today, I'd have my own credit card, and if a girl in a red 
convertible turned up, I'd be able to take her where she wanted to go. No 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
And Dad would pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't changed.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MORTE D'URBAN BY J. F. POWERS (WASHINGTON SQUARE: $8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This 1963 National Book Award-winning novel offers a tongue-in-cheek portrait 
of Catholic life in the Midwest during the '50s. Despite his ecclesiastical 
office, Father Urban displays the sort of unflagging boosterism that George F. 
Babbitt admired. 
</P>
<P>
To his enormous chagrin, this man of extravagant ambition finds himself stuck 
in the Clementines, a monastic order noted only for its utter lack of 
distinction. If he sometimes treats his parishioners as cannon fodder in a 
grand campaign, Father Urban always strives for the greater glory to God, the 
Clementines and himself, though not necessarily in that order. J. F. Powers' 
droll, understated account of life at an obscure Minnesota retreat will remind 
listeners of Garrison Keillor's Father Emil and the goings-on at Our Lady of 
Perpetual Responsibility in Lake Woebegon.

<P>
In recent years, the bicycle travelogue has developed into a genre of its own, 
a genre to which Kameel Nasr contributes remarkably little. 
</P>
<P>
The wonders of Africa, Asia, North and South America fail to elicit anything 
more from him than banalities. In his formula adventures, he rides into the 
countryside to meet the real people, which suggests that cities are inhabited 
by automatons and doppelgangers. Nasr offers a few complaints about the roads 
and weather but loves every country and its people, and they always treat him 
as an honored guest rather than a stranger. It's probably more fun to ride some 
of these trails than to read about them in "World Up Close."

<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON

<TEXT>
<P>
The people in Jean Rhys' brittle novel, originally published in 1929, are as 
stilted and artificial as the figures in an Erte lithograph. 
</P>
<P>
When her husband is arrested for selling stolen artworks, Marya, an 
Englishwoman living in Paris, is taken in by an Anglo-German couple, the 
Heidlers. This hospitable gesture soon develops into a romantic polygon that 
alternates between a triangle and a square. (As all four of them are too 
languidly world-weary to do much more than drink and complain about how unhappy 
they are, it's difficult to imagine them ever consummating a relationship.) The 
characters in "Quartet" suggest that the members of "la generation perdue" 
remained lost less through alienation than a lack of initiative.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the title suggests, this anthology contains extracts from various personal 
journals, including several from people who don't normally keep diaries but 
prepared something at the editor's request. Almost all the excerpts are 
presented without introduction or notes, so it's often difficult to figure out 
what's going on or why anyone should be interested. 
</P>
<P>
Who cares what Guy Davenport thinks about circumcision? Some entries offer 
potentially enticing bits of gossip, but they're all about people the reader's 
never heard of. In his journal from Tangier, Paul Bowles reports: "Rodrigo has 
bought a falcon. When Mrabet heard this, he decided that he was going to get it 
away from him and began to announce his plans for teaching it to hunt." 
Rodrigo? Mrabet?

LIGHT SCULPTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WEBB, Michael Webb writes about architecture in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abbot Kinney, the founder of Venice, once dreamed of building palaces in this 
seaside community. Now, a few blocks from the beach, architect Ted Tokio Tanaka 
has created a cluster of residences that might have fit Kinney's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Behind an impressive facade of cut-out arches and pediments and a fretted roof 
line are four 2,200-square-foot condominiums that deftly combine style, privacy 
and light. The style is bold: symmetrically arranged geometric shapes in white 
stucco as simple and engaging as a child's building blocks. Privacy is achieved 
through layering: The living room is set behind the cut-out facade and an inner 
wall of glass brick, features that let in lots of light and frame nearby palm 
trees while shielding the residents from the street. The units face southwest, 
but so deep are the windows that sunlight is diffused and softened. Even in the 
afternoon, when the sun is high, sharp edges dissolve. Patterns play across the 
walls and black concrete floor until the whole interior becomes a light 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Most impressive of all is the versatility of the space. Within a 30-foot height 
limit, Tanaka has designed six split levels. At the rear is sunken parking, 
with two small bedrooms stacked on top. In front is a double-height living 
room, an entry hall framed by an inset patio and a semi-open kitchen, with a 
steel-balustraded mezzanine gallery above. Most of the second floor is occupied 
by the master bedroom and a spacious balcony overlooking the street. 
</P>
<P>
Only one thing is missing: the canals that Kinney dug and city officials later 
filled in. How delightful it would have been to arrive at this Venetian palazzo 
in a gondola.

OUTTAKES: HOLLYWOOD HARRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years of trying, Hollywood has finally brought one of Jim Harrison's 
novels to the screen. It's Columbia's just-out "Revenge," starring Kevin 
Costner, which Harrison began scripting 11 years ago just after its 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I wrote about 12 different endings to it," says Harrison, noting that, 
originally, John Huston was going to direct Jack Nicholson in the project. Then 
it went to Orson Welles. And then . . . "I lost interest for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Costner and producer Ray Stark revived the project about a love triangle 
(Costner, Madeleine Stowe and Anthony Quinn) that leads to violence -- and 
brutal revenge. Tony Scott directs from a script by Harrison and Jeffrey 
Fiskin. 
</P>
<P>
"They pretty much shot the novella," says Harrison, who saw a print shipped to 
Northern Michigan, his home. "I was so swept away by it that I cried -- I 
really did. And I'm not known for crying." (He's known more for his macho 
style, on and off the page.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a host of projects -- based on Harrison's novels -- are percolating, 
including: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Man Who Gave Up His Name" and "Farmer," with Sydney Pollack's Mirage 
Prods. 
</P>
<P>
* "Legends of the Fall," recently purchased by film maker Ed Zwick and Tri-Star 
Pictures. Bill Witliffe is adapting. 
</P>
<P>
* "A Good Day to Die," with a French company, Compagne Production 
International. 
</P>
<P>
As to how Harrison gets along with Hollywood: "As a farmer, I come from a long 
generation of horse traders. It's not all that much different." Pat H. Broeske

Forest Whitaker is headed for Harlem, circa 1956. He'll star in "A Rage in 
Harlem," playing one of two brothers (the other's uncast) who, though polar 
opposites, come together over the course of "a nightmarish, roller-coaster 
weekend" in the New York neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Duke will make his feature directing debut, with filming expected to begin 
in late April. 
</P>
<P>
"The comedy in this action-comedy will be very dark," said Kerry Boyle, who'll 
co-produce with Stephen Woolley for Palace Prods. Miramax Films will distribute 
the $8-million film. 
</P>
<P>
Scripted by John Toles-Bey, "Rage" is based on a 1965 Chester Himes novel 
originally published as "For Love of Imabelle." It was Himes who created 
Gravedigger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson -- the Harlem cops who first came to 
the screen in "Cotton Comes to Harlem" (1970). Look for the duo to return -- as 
supporting characters -- in "Rage." 
</P>
<P>
Look, too, for Danny Glover -- in "a small, but very important role," a 
character named Easy Money. Pat H. Broeske

'As with every art, in photography the most important thing is that we feel 
fully what we are doing," said Hungarian-born photographer Andre Kertesz, 
describing the works he and his counterparts started producing just after World 
War I. These experiments -- the photographer interjecting his own feelings into 
the familiar -- would continue indefinitely under the rubric subjectivity. A 
stunning collection of prints representing the genre, "Experimental 
Photography: The New Subjectivity," is on display at The J. Paul Getty Museum, 
joining the remarkable Greek and Roman antiquities, pre-20th-Century Western 
European paintings, sculpture and decorative arts housed in the lovely 
re-created 1st-century Roman country villa overlooking the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Among the works: Kertesz's "Diver," Czechoslovakian Josef Sudek's "Late Roses," 
American expatriate Man Ray's "Cannes" and American W. Eugene Smith's "The 
Wake," all of which capture the drama of a moment in a single powerful image.

ARCHITECTS, DESIGNERS and old-house aficionadoes often run into trouble when 
working on the bathrooms of homes from bygone eras. 
</P>
<P>
Antique bathroom fixtures are particularly difficult to find. But there is 
help. Donald Hooper, owner of Vintage Plumbing &amp; Sanitary Specialties of 
Northridge, is a self-proclaimed "architectural-antiques salvager." "I 
concentrate on ornamental and unusual high-end stuff," Hooper explains. He has 
amassed an extensive collection of restored fancy pedestal lavatories, 
pull-chain toilets, claw-foot bath tubs and reproduction showers and faucets. 
The majority of Vintage Plumbing customers are redoing bathrooms, trading 
sterile modernism for an appealing period ambiance. Hooper also repairs and 
restores original, irreplaceable fixtures to pristine condition.

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: OPERA CUPBOARD ISN'T BARE ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, Southern California opera lovers looked at a bare landscape -- 
occasionally dotted with a production here or there. But now from Los Angeles 
to San Diego there is a choice of fare -- be it the big-budget, high-profile, 
internationally cast attractions of Music Center Opera or the various other 
offerings from enterprises south of Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
No one argues that opera hereabouts, or the population, is proliferating. In 10 
years, another 24 million licensed drivers will be further clogging the 
freeways, and local impresarios such as Opera Pacific's David DiChiera sees 
"traffic density as the key to separate urban arts centers." 
</P>
<P>
He said that audiences will probably not avail themselves of choices inasmuch 
as people prefer to avoid an hour's drive (or more) when they have 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole repertory approach takes this into account," DiChiera, general 
director of the Costa Mesa-based company, explained. "Since I'm in the business 
of building an audience, it's important to note my constituency and get into 
the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"People here (in Orange County) have had limited exposure to opera, so it 
behooves me to offer bread-and-butter Puccini, for instance, and stay away from 
difficult pieces -- at least for now." 
</P>
<P>
His company, a resident of the Orange County Performing Arts Center, began 
building its subscription list in 1987, a year after Los Angeles Music Center 
Opera (LAMCO) was inaugurated. 
</P>
<P>
"We started from scratch," DiChiera said, "and now count 10,000 names." And a 
budget of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Hemmings, director of the $12-million Music Center Opera, confirms 
DiChiera's notion that audiences like to stay put in their respective 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"And that makes the proliferation even more impressive," he says, "because 
there's very little crossover, the houses are full and the demand is 
considerable." 
</P>
<P>
But all is not as glorious as it seems, warned Hemmings: "At the moment one 
would think we have an abundance of opera. But the picture is deceptive. What 
we have is a cluster of activity in these particular months." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that the 25-year-old San Diego Opera, for instance, now schedules 
everything in the spring and that, for a more accurate impression, one must 
look at what the fall season turns up. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opera buffs need not hazard gridlock. With performances of 
"Falstaff" at the Music Center, "Turandot" at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, "Dialogues des Carmelites" in San Diego continuing and "Don Giovanni" 
and "Don Carlo" just ahead, opera-goers have quite a selection -- compared to 
no selection five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Also, other activity on the opera scene: Upcoming is the L.A. premiere of 
"Power Failure" by the Paul Dresher Ensemble at UCLA Feb. 23 and 24. An 
opera-theater collaboration by composer Dresher, Rinde Eckert and director 
Richard E.T. White, the work shows the characters competing for power in a 
pharmaceutical research company and the abuse and greed that drives its top 
management. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the two one-act operas, Puccini's "Gianni Schicchi" and Gian Carlo 
Menotti's "The Medium," also at UCLA the next two Fridays and Saturdays at 8 
p.m. The fully staged work is presented by UCLA Opera Workshop and the UCLA 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
A gala concert by the Opera Buffs, a support group that provides scholarship to 
budding opera singers, will take place at 2 p.m. today at Mount St. Mary's 
College. Soprano Ealynn Voss and tenor Jorge Lopez-Yanez will be featured in 
concert. Voss, incidentally, alternately sings the title role in Opera 
Pacific's "Turandot," which opened Friday, and closes March 4. 
</P>
<P>
JEWISH MUSIC -- Ethnic music, especially ethnic art music, says Neal Brostoff, 
founder of the Jewish Music Foundation, is "only now being tapped." Ten years 
ago, Brostoff observes, "There were no Jewish music organizations in this area. 
Now there are three and we are the new kid on the block." He says each of these 
groups -- the others are the Friends of Jewish Music in Orange County and the 
San Fernando Valley-based Jewish Music Commission -- concentrate on a different 
area of music. 
</P>
<P>
Brostoff's foundation leans toward "the more contemporary and avant-garde," 
and, in the four years of its existence, the foundation, said Brostoff, has 
been successful in attracting audiences and institutional and grant support for 
its nonprofit programs (a budget of about $22,000 annually -- with no paid 
staff). 
</P>
<P>
The foundation presents its third season beginning Tuesday and Wednesday with 
twin performances by the touring Boston Camerata, led by Joel Cohen. The 
six-member ensemble from Massachusetts will present Jewish music of the 13th to 
18th Centuries at Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel in Westwood on Tuesday and 
Temple Bat Yahm in Newsport Beach on Wednesday, both at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Kol Eesha -- Music by Women Composers" is the name of the second program of 
this 1990 season to be given in Schoenberg Hall at UCLA on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
Writers to be represented are Smadar Handelsman, Miriam Gideon, Diane Thome, 
Verdina Shlonsky and Tsippi Fleisher. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine from L.A.," the June 10 program to be performed at Leo Baeck Temple in 
Bel-Air, is a retrospective of California composers transplanted here for work 
in films and other local industries, 1940-81. Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, Max 
Helfman, Eric Zeisl, Maurice Goldman, Robert Strassburg, William Sharlin, 
Aminadav Alani, Joseph Kantor and Michael Isaacson are the featured composers. 
</P>
<P>
NOW HEAR THIS: Choreographers, dance teachers, musicians and other performers 
who use music could be liable for huge fines if they violate a tough new 
Environmental Protection Agency anti-noise pollution law. The Local Law 92 
("Disco Bill") calls for violators to pay fines of $1,000 a day, with second 
offenses costing $4,000. The EPA statute also defines the allowable level for 
music to be 45 decibels, while jackhammers and other construction equipment are 
allowed to operate at 90 db (permanent hearing damage is 85 db, normal 
conversation is 60 db).

POP EYE: 'MISS SAIGON' SINGS PRIOR TO BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unless you're willing to fly to London, you can't possibly see "Miss Saigon," 
theater impresario Cameron Mackintosh's latest musical extravaganza. But you 
can buy the original London cast recording this week -- even though the musical 
won't open on Broadway until sometime in the spring of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
What's the rush? 
</P>
<P>
"Through the success other labels had with 'Les Miserables' and 'Phantom of the 
Opera,' we've realized there's an incredible market for cast recordings, long 
before the show actually arrives here," said Geffen Records president Ed 
Rosenblatt, whose label is releasing the double-album (and two CD) cast 
recording. "These kinds of shows are worldwide media events." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Rosenblatt predicts that the London cast recording, whose CDs sell for 
a whopping $31.98 (the double-album on vinyl goes for $19.98) will break the 
platinum barrier of 1 million copies sold before the show arrives in the 
States. 
</P>
<P>
If so, the sales success will be a testimony to the new global reach of such 
high-tech entertainment packages as "Miss Saigon," which like its "Les Miz" 
predecessor, is more of an event than a traditional stage musical. (Reviewing 
the show, which is set in crumbling 1975 Saigon, Newsweek dubbed it " 'Madame 
Butterfly' with choppers.") 
</P>
<P>
It would be the lastest in a series of recorded stage shows that reached 
America before the show itself. "Jesus Christ Superstar," "Evita" and "Chess" 
were earlier examples of the trend. 
</P>
<P>
It's somehow fitting that Geffen, which owns a "significant" chunk of the the 
"Miss Saigon" production, is releasing the London cast recording at a time when 
the record business is abuzz with reports that industry giant EMI is 
negotiating to either buy Geffen or distribute its musical releases worldwide. 
In an era when entertainment conglomerates eagerly gobble up new product, 
Geffen's release of the "Saigon" score is a perfect example of corporate 
synergy. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Miss Saigon' is the ultimate in synergy," Rosenblatt said. "The cast album 
helps advertise the show. And then when people see the show, they want to buy 
the album. So it works on both ends." 
</P>
<P>
So far, this marketing scheme has paid off in record sales for Geffen. It's 
distribution of "Cats" has topped the 2 million mark, while "Les Miz" is at 
950,000 and "Dreamgirls" has sold a solid 500,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
PolyGram Records, which distributes original cast recordings of both Andrew 
Lloyd-Webber's "Phantom of the Opera" and "Aspects of Love," has enjoyed equal 
success. The double-CD set of "Phantom," which was released five months before 
the show hit Broadway, has now sold nearly 1.5 million copies, an impressive 
figure, especially considering that PolyGram also released a single-CD 
"highlights" package that sold an additional 600,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Polygram marketing chief Jim Urie credits the label's aggressive marketing 
strategy with stimulating sales. After the show hit Broadway, PolyGram 
organized contests at many adult-contemporary radio stations, sponsoring ticket 
giveaways and free trips to New York to see the show. 
</P>
<P>
"People's motivations for buying scores and sound tracks are completely 
different," said Urie, PolyGram's senior vice president of marketing. "People 
buy movie sound tracks because of a hit song. But they buy original cast 
recordings because of the show's story line or because of the event-atmosphere 
surrounding it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, original scores are expensive to market and produce. Rosenblatt says 
Geffen has earmarked an initial ad budget of $500,000 for the cast album, which 
cost another $250,000 -- or more -- to produce. Thankfully, the media provides 
a generous boost of free advertising. Even though "Miss Saigon" isn't due here 
for another year, the splashy show has already received write-ups in Time, 
Life, People and Newsweek and many key newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of Americans have already been over to London, as tourists, to 
see the show," said Rosenblatt. "And then there's always a ton of people who 
just want to own an original cast recording. It's like having a first-edition 
of a popular new book. They'll probably want to buy the American cast recording 
too." 
</P>
<P>
And talk about synergy. Guess who'll be putting out the American cast 
recording, within two months of "Miss Saigon's" opening day on Broadway? Geffen 
Records, of course.

SEX, LIES AND: Color us astonished. Frank Magid Associates, a respected 
Iowa-based research firm, recently conducted a sexual attitude survey to 
determine, among other things, what performers people enjoyed listening to 
"during a sexual experience." 
</P>
<P>
(The survey was commissioned by "Hard Copy," a tabloid-TV show with an 
unquenchable fascination for such matters.) The results come as something of a 
shock. We'd have expected Madonna or Smokey Robinson (or at least Frank 
Sinatra) to emerge as winners. But Magid, who claims to have surveyed 1,000 
adults from age 18 to 49, insists that the most popular artist for sexual 
encounters is . . . Neil Diamond. At No. 2 is Beethoven (!), with other Top 10 
sexual healers including Luther Vandross, Randy Travis (!), Kenny G., Glenn 
Miller (!!), Mozart and Led Zeppelin (!!!). Smokey and Madonna and the Chairman 
of the Board were nowhere to be found, all eclipsed by country picker Conway 
Twitty (!!!!), who finished 15th.

FORTY SOMETHING: Elektra Records has a big anniversary coming up this May -- 
its 40th! The label has several events planned for the celebration, most 
notably a double album that features present-day Elektra artists covering hits 
from earlier label mainstays. So far the lineup includes the Georgia Satellites 
doing John Fogerty's "Another Saturday Night," Metallica doing Queen's "Stone 
Cold Crazy," the Black Velvet Band doing Warren Zevon's "Werewolves of London," 
the Pixies doing Paul Butterfield's "Born in Chicago," Billy Bragg doing Love's 
"Alone Again Or," Linda Ronstadt doing "The Blacksmith" by Cathy &amp; Carol 
and (Are you sitting down?!) Faster Pussycat doing Carly Simon's "You're So 
Vain." Other artists involved include the Cure, Anita Baker and Teddy 
Pendergrast. . . . How's this for an unusual duo? Carla Olson and ex-Rolling 
Stones guitarist Mick Taylor will be at the Roxy March 4, where the pair will 
record a live album, for release later later this year.

THE TARGET IS ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the article "The Target Is Rock" by Chuck Philips (Feb. 11), Ramona Ripston, 
executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, said that: "Rock 'n' roll is an art form just like literature. Nobody 
would dare suggest labeling classic books which deal with controversial 
subjects." 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is that the literary world has reached a level of 
success in the area of censorship; it has fought long, pitched battles against 
government agencies which opposed the dissemination of so-called obscene 
materials. Let us not forget the battles fought in publishing James Joyce's 
"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man," or William S. Burroughs' "Naked 
Lunch." These works were attacked and went through litigation before 
publication in their respective eras -- now both are considered "classics." 
</P>
<P>
The record industry must begin its own march against the dark hand of 
censorship. The heavy-metal and rap artists of the '90s are faced with new 
conservative opposition to their music. They must find the happy median between 
iconoclasm and a sense of community.

<TEXT>
<P>
"Socially conscious" film maker Michael Moore claims to have had the future and 
interests of Flint, Mich., residents in mind when he made "Roger &amp; Me." 
However, Moore is nothing greater than a free-wheeling, opportunistic scavenger 
who, through clever editing and misleading distortion of facts, holds the 
residents and civic leaders of Flint up for derision and humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than ameliorating the problem or drawing sympathy for his beloved 
hometown, Moore's foul sense of humor and highly accessible media profile only 
serve to promote and further his own interest in establishing a career as 
another Hollywood icon.

ROGER &amp; REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Rainer's piece on Michael Moore's "Roger &amp; Me" raises more questions 
than it answers, especially about the art of film editing. Anyone who has ever 
done it knows how manipulative it is. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, you juxtapose Roger Smith giving a Dickensian message of 
Christmas good cheer with shots of people being tossed out of their homes, what 
is the emotional impact likely to be? 
</P>
<P>
And anyone in film or television knows that if you try to interview a tycoon 
without an appointment you are likely to be hedged off by flacks -- and that if 
you throw sociological questions at a beauty queen as she comes off a parade 
the answers are likely to be less than profound. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest questions remain unanswered. Does a corporation or an industry have 
any ethical responsibility to the community in which it locates? Does it have 
the right to move elsewhere if it can get a better deal? Perhaps these can be 
answered with another question: Is Warner Bros. distributing this film out of 
idealism or because it thinks there is profit in it?

Peter Rainer's article is wonderful. He has clarified the tangle of issues, 
ideas, politics, aesthetics and emotions that emerged in the heated debate 
sparked by the film and he provides information and history on the documentary 
film. 
</P>
<P>
His is a very thoughtful and much-needed analysis.

Re: "Roger and Reality" (Feb. 11): I believe the Peter Rainer and others are 
perhaps missing the crucial point to Michael Moore's infractions. 
</P>
<P>
OK, so he restaged events; he "lied to tell the truth" but beyond that he 
stirred up a flurry of emotions through juxtaposition of image and sound. He 
coyly manipulated his case -- editorializing rather than documenting. It's 
symbiotic; he's driven home not only these events of Flint, Mich., but his 
subtext as well. If we are to be told a story with blinders on, then that story 
should be called fiction.

ROSEMARY COTNOIR throws her best art pieces on the floor for people to walk on. 
A talented maker of decorative floor cloths, she has mastered the art of 
transforming heavy raw cotton duck into paintings for the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Most of her themes borrow from Russian, Egyptian, Babylonian and Abyssinian 
usages of ornamentation, but some cloths possess a touch of whimsy -- one, for 
instance, is painted to resemble a set of 3-D shelves holding a nautilus shell. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1700s, the New England settlers produced a similar type of floor 
covering, but Cotnoir has an advantage: the availability of modern materials to 
make her floor cloths far more durable. With her designs, she first applies 
four coats of wall primer to the front and two coats to the back. ("People are 
surprised that my cloths are heavy, and that they don't buckle," she says.) 
Next, she cuts corners, folds under the edges and glues them in place, before 
sanding the front surface and covering it with white oil-based paint. Then the 
artist takes over. Working from a thumbnail sketch, Cotnoir applies her color 
design with acrylic paints, and when these are dry, she covers the cloth with 
five to six coats of polyurethane on the front and two coats on the back. The 
entire process takes about four days, and she prices her pieces, generally 3x5 
feet, between $400 and $600. 
</P>
<P>
Cotnoir is not stingy with her secrets: "Don't use polyurethane out of the 
can," she warns. "Dilute it -- one part paint thinner, three parts 
polyurethane, and stir it well to mix it."

OREGON'S BAN ON SELF-SERVICE GAS ATTACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An Oregon law banning self-service gasoline pumps has pitted those who don't 
want to pay an extra 10 cents against those who don't want to walk an extra 10 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1951, most Oregonians have been legally prohibited from doing what 
motorists do every day in 48 other states: drive into a gas station, pump their 
own fuel, pay the attendant and drive off. 
</P>
<P>
The only exception to the no-self-service law are commercial customers at 
"card-lock" stations, who can fill their own tanks by using a credit card to 
open the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ban say customers should be able to choose the kind of service 
-- if any -- they want. Supporters say self-service amounts to no service. 
</P>
<P>
"Where there is self-service there really isn't an option," said Dell Isham, a 
lobbyist for the AAA automobile club of Oregon, which has led the fight to keep 
the law. "People won't have a choice anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to repeal the law say Oregonians don't have a choice now. 
</P>
<P>
"In this state, we allow someone to have an abortion, but we won't allow them 
to pump their own gasoline," said Bob Barman, who operates five gas stations in 
the Willamette Valley and has been active in the fight for self-serve. "This 
issue is not going to die until justice is done." 
</P>
<P>
Barman and his allies say filling up would be cheaper, safer and quicker if 
people could do it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
At least one gas station owner became so frustrated with the law that he put up 
a sign inviting motorists to serve themselves, earning a citation from local 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Good or bad, the unusual prohibition -- New Jersey is the only other state that 
bans self-service -- is the source of a perennial Oregon political battle. More 
than 10 bills to lift the ban have died in the Legislature over the years and a 
similar initiative petition was killed by voters in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition led by Atlantic Richfield is suing the state, claiming that the ban 
is unconstitutional. The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the ban, but the case 
is expected to go before the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The fight for self-serve teams cost-conscious consumers with major oil 
companies that want to operate stations without facing high labor costs. On the 
other side are independent gas station operators, the automobile club, labor 
unions and, so far, a majority of voters. 
</P>
<P>
There is little agreement on what would happen to gas prices if self service 
were allowed in Oregon. Currently, prices in the state are between other 
states' self-serve and full-serve prices. 
</P>
<P>
According to an AAA survey taken in late December, full-service gasoline 
averaged $1.261 per gallon across the nation, while the average self-service 
price nationally was $1.068 per gallon, according to Doug Peeples, a spokesman 
for the Oregon automobile club. 
</P>
<P>
The same survey showed that gas in Oregon averaged $1.165 per gallon, exactly 
halfway between the national self-serve and full-serve prices. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, self-service supporters say that if the law were changed, gas 
would be cheaper for motorists who want to pump their own and no more expensive 
for people who want to be helped. Just as predictably, opponents of a change 
say self-service prices would be roughly the current price, while full-service 
prices would rise substantially. 
</P>
<P>
Self-serve opponents say the higher cost would be particularly unfair for the 
elderly and the handicapped, who often are unable to fill their own tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides also disagree about which system is safer. Opponents say that 
California -- which has self-service -- has more gas station fires than Oregon 
per capita. Supporters say Oregon has more fires per fill-up. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Hampson, the lead lawyer in the Atlantic Richfield suit, said he 
believes self-service is safer because people are less likely to spill gas or 
drive off prematurely when they are filling their own vehicles. Self-serve 
supporters also point out that in Oregon, one attendant often has to hustle 
around filling three or four cars. 
</P>
<P>
The only exceptions to Oregon's self-service ban are "card lock" stations. 
Under a 1966 ruling by the state's attorney general, those stations can allow 
commercial customers, such as business people, to fill their own tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Self-serve advocates say that in many parts of remote eastern Oregon, where 
attended gas stations are often difficult to find, card-lock stations have in 
effect become self-service operations, widely used by private citizens, not 
just businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Station owners in western Oregon who want self-serve say the current system is 
unfair because it allows their counterparts in the eastern part of the state to 
operate what amount to self-service stations.

SCIENTISTS HARNESSING BODY'S NATURAL AGENTS AS POWERFUL HEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY THOMPSON, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Instead of the sharp edge of the scalpel or a massive blast of toxic chemicals 
to wipe out illness, doctors are turning to the body to heal itself. 
</P>
<P>
They are taking the body's natural products -- hormones, antibodies, enzymes 
and even whole cells -- to attack disease and restore normal functioning. 
Cancer, Parkinson's disease, heart disorders and hormone deficiencies are all 
the targets of this new approach to treating illness. 
</P>
<P>
Harnessing these new "natural" agents produced by the body might be called 
biological therapy, or biotherapy, much as toxic chemicals used to treat cancer 
are called chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
It all started with the genetic-engineering revolution in the 1970s when 
scientists learned how to manipulate genes in the laboratory. Previously rare 
human proteins -- interferon, interleukin-2, human insulin and human-growth 
factor -- could suddenly be mass produced with these new gene-engineering 
techniques. Although the early experiments in human patients failed to live up 
to expectations, solid gains have been made and physicians remain optimistic 
about the role of biotherapies. 
</P>
<P>
"In the next decade, the major advance will be genetic therapies," said Bruce 
A. Chabner, director of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer 
treatment. Genetic manipulation, for example, is being increasingly studied as 
a way to fight diseases such as cancer and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of biotherapies has been around for decades, though the first ones 
were crude. Cow insulin, a protein essential for signaling cells to pull sugar 
from the blood, was discovered in the 1920s and injected into the bodies of 
diabetics. 
</P>
<P>
Vaccination -- the injection of a living but inactive virus or bacteria into 
the body -- showed that it was possible to manipulate the body's natural 
defenses. The immune system was programmed to prevent subsequent infection by 
that particular bacteria or virus. 
</P>
<P>
Just before World War II, doctors discovered that blood could be transfused 
between individuals. And beginning in the 1960s came the organ transplants -- 
heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidney, even bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
The common factor between these now standard treatments is that they use 
natural substances -- cells in the transfusion, organs in the transplants, 
viruses in the vaccines, protein in the insulin. But they are limited. Blood 
doesn't always match; organs are rejected; improperly prepared vaccines can 
cause the disease they were intended to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the problems came from incomplete understanding of the biology. The new 
generation of biotherapies is changing that, putting in doctors' hands some of 
the most powerful treatments ever developed. Biotherapies fall, generally, into 
three groups: proteins, genes and cells. 
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, physicians have been putting to use the natural 
medicines produced for the first time by the biotechnology labs. Genetic 
engineers have learned to put specific human genes into bacteria, turning the 
bacteria into miniature factories that grow large quantities of the human 
proteins doctors can use against a certain disease. The new protein 
biotherapies include: 
</P>
<P>
* Clot busters. Several natural proteins have been found that rapidly dissolve 
blood clots. Physicians now routinely inject these clot busters to stop heart 
attacks in mid-attack -- something that never had been possible. Additionally, 
these drugs also have been used experimentally to stop strokes and open painful 
blockages in leg arteries. 
</P>
<P>
* Blood boosters. A set of proteins has been found that stimulate the bone 
marrow to produce both red blood cells and certain types of white blood cells. 
Growing red blood cells is revolutionizing the care for end-stage renal 
failure, which causes the body to stop making blood. Before this discovery, 
these patients needed constant transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
Stimulating white blood cells boosts immunity to various types of infections. 
It can prevent some of the secondary diseases associated with AIDS. Its most 
important use, however, may be the countering of the immune-destroying effects 
of cancer chemotherapy, thus allowing physicians to treat tumors with larger 
doses of the poisonous drugs and kill the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* Height control. Human-growth factor can literally add inches to children of 
short stature. They don't always reach normal height, but they reach heights 
previously impossible. Some also have talked about using this powerful hormone 
for weight loss, and there have been reports of use by some athletes seeking an 
extra edge. 
</P>
<P>
* Antibodies. The body's immune system produces thousands of different-shaped 
proteins called antibodies that recognize invading bacteria and viruses by 
their shape -- and then attack them. Scientists have learned how to make 
antibodies of any given type -- called monoclonal antibodies -- that can be 
used to diagnose disease both in the lab and in the body and can be used to 
attack cancer cells directly. 
</P>
<P>
Organ transplants and blood transfusions have led the way in the use of living 
cells or tissues to treat an illness. But the new biotherapies take it all a 
quantum leap further. 
</P>
<P>
* Brain transplants. Clearly the brain itself cannot be transplanted, but parts 
of the brain wear out for uncertain reasons. Parkinson's disease arises with 
the loss of certain brains cells that produce a chemical needed for normal 
movement. Neurosurgeons have now experimented with transplanting into the brain 
patches of human cells that produce the missing chemical. Preliminary 
experiments with nerve cells taken from aborted fetuses reportedly show 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
* Tissue transplants. In diabetes, pancreatic cells stop secreting the protein 
insulin. Although insulin can be injected every day, control of blood sugar is 
better when a pancreas is transplanted into the body. A number of human 
experiments are under way to inject just the insulin-making cells in the hope 
that they will work better and be easier to protect from rejection. 
</P>
<P>
* Killing cancer. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute have found that 
certain white blood cells are primed to attack cancers. They remove those cells 
and stimulate them in the lab with a growth factor called interleukin-2. Once 
several billion of the white blood cells have grown in the lab, they are put 
back into the patient's body and attack the tumor. More than half of the 
patients with the skin cancer malignant melanoma and with kidney cancer now 
respond to this treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The third general form of biotherapy, genetic, relies on the recent ability to 
insert genes into cells of the body. Genes control the production of proteins, 
so gene transfers can be used to replace a missing protein permanently. This is 
the future of medicine, many believe. About 4,000 inherited diseases could be 
attacked by this technology. 
</P>
<P>
* First steps. In the first gene transfer experiments in humans, begun last 
year at the National Institutes of Health, cancer researchers put a bacterial 
gene into the white blood cells they already had been turning into cancer 
killers. The gene allows them to track the altered blood cells in the body and 
to see which type best kills the cancer. Future experiments in which other 
genes are added should boost the cell's cancer-killing power. 
</P>
<P>
* Artificial organs. The biggest problem with gene therapy is getting the 
altered cells back into the body so that they survive. One approach under 
development in animals creates an artificial organ by growing the gene-modified 
cells on a synthetic pad that is surgically placed in the animal's abdomen. 
Hormones are added that make blood vessels grow into the pad. Theoretically, 
the newly created organ could be designed to secrete any protein to treat a 
wide array of illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new biotherapies have begun to radically alter the treatment of 
disease, they also have created controversies. For example, some of the tissue 
transplanted for diabetes and Parkinson's comes from aborted fetuses. Groups 
opposed to abortion have so strongly opposed the use of this material that the 
government no longer funds any related research. 
</P>
<P>
The debate will grow more intense as the massive project to identify and 
analyze every single human gene, now being developed at NIH, gets under way. It 
will speed the ability to detect diseases for which nothing can be done. That 
means doctors will be able to tell which patients are likely to get which 
diseases. Will patients want to know?

TRANSSEXUAL MAYORAL CANDIDATE TELLS YOUNTVILLE: 'CHANGE WILL DO YOU GOOD'

<P>
Things have been pretty lively around the veterans home since Terri Pohrman, a 
transsexual Brigitte Nielsen-look-alike, starting running for mayor in tights 
under the banner "The Change Will Do You Good." 
</P>
<P>
The former Las Vegas showgirl was a regular entertainer at the California 
Veterans' Home before she entered the race, but the stakes have gone up because 
more than 700 of the 1,800 registered voters in this wine country town live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The big-shouldered blonde with spiky hair faces two opponents in the April 10 
election. She wants an additional 500 residents of the home to register to 
vote. In the 1988 Yountville elections, only 535 people bothered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pohrman visited the home on a recent weekend wearing roller-skates and a tight 
body stocking with huge red cardboard hearts over her front and back. Later, 
she donned a red sequined cocktail dress with a plunging neckline. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys got a big kick out of her," said Gene Sockness, 61. "She's really 
welcome up here and shows us a good time. So what the heck, live and let live." 
</P>
<P>
Pohrman's ambitions have panicked some residents of this conservative town of 
3,200, situated in the Napa Valley about 40 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very serious about this," said Pohrman, 37, a costume jewelry saleswoman 
who calls herself "Miss Terri." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be mayor and these people are scared," she said. "They think I'll 
open a bunch of massage parlors and adult bookstores." 
</P>
<P>
Pohrman moved to Yountville two years ago. A native of Portland, Ore., Pohrman 
was a teen-age female impersonator before having a sex change operation in San 
Francisco in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
She opened a jewelry and dress shop and hit the road last year as a sales 
representative. She first entered politics after the town's design-review 
committee questioned the appropriateness of the advertising on her boutique. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Bob Myers says she violated ordinances by placing colored, plastic 
flags around her shop and in the trees. She also had flashing neon lights and a 
sandwich-board sign not allowed under local codes. The name of her shop was 
Such a Deal. 
</P>
<P>
Pohrman said she wants to bring the town together as "one big family," and 
takes innovative stands on issues. On flood control, for instance, she says the 
first thing she'd do is buy pink lifeboats for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"She's flamboyant for up here, but maybe not by San Francisco standards," said 
60-year-old veteran Walter Allen, who lives at the veterans home. 
</P>
<P>
Pohrman's critics include Carlee Leftwich, the mayor pro-tem and a six-year 
council veteran who is running against Pohrman. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who assumes that because the veterans are elderly and have health 
problems that they are also stupid is making a terrible mistake," said 
Leftwich. "I would never attempt to garner their votes by entertaining them." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kessler, a 65-year-old resident of the home, said of Pohrman: "She's 
trying to work the vet's home for votes. To me she is nothing but a burlesque 
queen. A lot of these old senile vets are taken in by her." 
</P>
<P>
But Pohrman's conscience is clear: "I love those people," she said.

NUCLEAR-PLANT'S NEIGHBORS AWAIT PRELIMINARY DATA ON EXPOSURE LEVEL; 
</P>
<P>
NORTHWEST: THE FIRST RESULTS ARE DUE FOR RELEASE IN APRIL. BUT OFFICIALS FEAR 
THAT RESIDENTS WILL MISINTERPRET THE REPORT ABOUT HANFORD NUCLEAR RESERVATION'S 
IMPACT ON THE AREA.

<P>
Scientists studying what the radiation exposure levels around the Hanford 
Nuclear Reservation were during the Cold War are trying to decide how to break 
the news of their preliminary findings to Northwest residents. 
</P>
<P>
The initial announcement of results from the first-ever study on the question 
is due in April, and the task of releasing the data is fraught with dangers of 
misinterpretation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're walking such a fine line," said Mary Lou Blazek, Hanford programs 
manager for the Oregon Energy Department in Salem and vice chairwoman of a 
panel of independent scientists overseeing the $15-million Energy Department 
multiphase study of radiation exposure from Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project, conducted by the 
government contractor Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, was launched 
after the public learned for the first time in 1986 of massive radiation 
releases from Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
Blazek said the initial announcement may involve hypotheticals and stressed the 
information is subject to change as the study progresses. 
</P>
<P>
"We may say if you were 16, and you lived in Pasco in 1944-'46, and your food 
intake was this, then your dose could have been this," Blazek said. 
</P>
<P>
Blazek, who chairs the communications subcommittee of the oversight panel, said 
scientists may also try to explain what the health consequences of a certain 
dose could be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult because of the science involved," she said. "It's difficult 
because there are so many variables involved. You have to make so many 
assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you have X millirems. That is equivalent to what? We can't even agree on 
that in our own panel." 
</P>
<P>
The government said in 1986 that more than 500,000 curies of iodine-131 were 
released between 1945 and 1956 from Hanford during accidents and planned 
experiments. An estimated 15 to 24 curies were released during the 1979 Three 
Mile Island nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
The studies under way are designed to estimate how much of the radiation people 
were exposed to in the 570-square-mile site along the Columbia River in 
south-central Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Hanford, an old complex of military reactors that is now focusing on cleaning 
up extensive environmental contamination, helped build the first atomic bomb 
exploded in New Mexico, as well as the weapon that fell on Nagasaki. 
</P>
<P>
Many Hanford "downwinders" claim the radiation releases have increased the 
cancer rate in the area. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial and limited state study found cancer mortality rates near 
Hanford are actually lower than the national average, although the federal 
Centers for Disease Control is preparing to conduct its own $5-million study of 
cancer rates in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC has previously estimated that about 20,000 children may have drunk milk 
exposed to radioactive iodine from Hanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanford dose reconstruction project is planned in four phases and may 
continue through 1993. Results from the first phase will reflect its limited 
scope, Blazek said. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase focuses on 10 counties closest to Hanford: Washington's Adams, 
Benton, Walla Walla, Franklin, Klickitat, Yakima, Kittitas and Grant and 
Oregon's Umatilla and Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
No decision has been made on whether future phases will expand the study east 
and south into more of rural Washington and Oregon and into Idaho, or north to 
the region's population center around Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
The study's first phase will estimate exposure to iodine-131, although future 
phases could look at other isotopes. 
</P>
<P>
The initial phase will examine exposure from airborne radiation from 1944 to 
1947 and exposure through water from 1964 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Indian tribes were not extensively studied in the first phase, but in later 
phases eight Northwest tribes are expected to participate. Scientists are 
interested in radiation exposure to Indians because their diets and life styles 
differ from other populations. 
</P>
<P>
Although exposure levels have not been released, scientists have already come 
up with some potentially important conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Milk drinkers in the Walla Walla area may have received more radiation than 
people closer to Hanford because of the milk distribution system in place at 
the time, and scientists think the same may apply in Pendleton, Ore. The milk 
was contaminated because cows ate radioactive feed. 
</P>
<P>
And potential radiation exposure from the Columbia River was probably low 
because of the huge river's diffusion capabilities, Blazek said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Energy Department declassified 19,000 pages of information about the 
radiation releases, Blazek said officials tried "sort of back of the envelope 
calculations" of potential radiation doses to people. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're at an 8-by-11 sheet of paper. We're nowhere near the finished 
report," she said.

HOLLAND'S NEW HOPE TO STOP SEA -- WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
UTRECHT, Netherlands 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Dutch scientist has proposed a novel idea to get rid of chemical waste and at 
the same time help save his country from one of its constant nightmares -- the 
threat of inundation from the sea. 
</P>
<P>
His scheme, which has drawn wide media attention and the interest of government 
officials, would raise the low-lying coastal areas of the Netherlands by 
pouring sulfuric acid chemical wastes into the limestone sub-surface. 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Olaf Schuiling of Utrecht University, a geochemist, said his idea came to 
him in a flash when he woke up early one morning. It is based on a simple 
principle: Sulfuric acid mixed with limestone forms gypsum, which has twice the 
volume of the original limestone. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first thought this up, I said to myself that I had better not talk 
about it, because people would think I was crazy. But when I playfully 
discussed it with some colleagues, they took me more seriously than I 
expected," he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Utrecht University has applied for a patent on his idea. The Delft Soil 
Mechanics Research Institute has given it support in feasibility studies, and 
the government's Transport and Water Ministry, responsible for the country's 
dikes and coastal protection, is looking into the idea. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Schuiling has done thermodynamic calculations of the reaction under all 
proposed conditions and made a miniature model to show that the soil expands 
and rises as he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of raising limestone-based land surfaces using sulfuric acid might 
also be applicable in the Indian Ocean's Maldive Islands, which face potential 
flooding because of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
Schuiling has proposed that the eastern part of Ameland, an island off the 
northwest coast of the Netherlands, as a test site. 
</P>
<P>
His idea is to bore holes about 1,500 feet into the ground -- less than the 
depth of most oil wells -- and pour in a million tons of waste sulfuric acid, 
which is produced by the paint and galvanizing industries. 
</P>
<P>
Schuiling said that, according to his calculations, if the waste is poured in 
over the period of a year, it would be possible to raise by three feet an area 
100 yards wide and six miles long. 
</P>
<P>
The holes would reach so far down that there would be no risk of contamination 
to ground water or top soil, according to Schuiling. 
</P>
<P>
"At the depth of 500 meters (1,500 feet), we are far away from shallow, sweet 
water aquifers, and there are impermeable clay layers above," he said. "In 
addition, the metals in the acid would be immobilized in the limestone and 
would not escape upward." 
</P>
<P>
Schuiling's idea could also be applied offshore to raise sea beds and divert 
water currents away from coastal areas, something that he said is virtually 
impossible with present engineering techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Netherlands lies below sea level and is protected by dikes. 
Geological changes and rising sea levels from global warming are expected to 
force the government to spend tens of millions of dollars each year in the 
coming decades to reinforce its coast with fresh sand. 
</P>
<P>
Schuiling's daring alternative, however, has so far raised more questions than 
answers, and some officials believe it would be more expensive than simply 
replenishing coastal sand. 
</P>
<P>
One likely problem could be cracks created in the formation of the gypsum. 
Schuiling believes the cracking would occur too far underground to cause any 
harm near the surface, but he admits that a pilot project is needed to test his 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty is figuring out how the sulfuric acid would be absorbed as 
the limestone turned into less permeable gypsum. 
</P>
<P>
Schuiling believes the cracks would partially counteract the decreasing 
permeability of the forming gypsum and spread the acid. 
</P>
<P>
Still another issue is whether it is worth going to these lengths to get rid of 
sulfuric acid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists point out that new, cleaner industrial procedures are 
reducing sulfuric acid waste and say the emphasis in the future should be on 
even better processes and recycling -- rather than underground dumping.

IVORY BAN HURTS JAPAN'S CARVING TRADE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan's ban on ivory imports may help save the African elephant, but ivory 
artisans believe that it may mean the end of the centuries-old industry of 
carving Japanese signature seals. 
</P>
<P>
The price of ivory, up sixfold at the wholesale level, began to rise long 
before delegates gathered in October at the Convention on International Trade 
in Endangered Species to ban the trade, said Akitoshi Kobayashi, a 69-year-old 
master carver. 
</P>
<P>
For Japan's ivory workers, the ban will mean a drop in income, said Kobayashi, 
who has been in the trade for more than 50 years in Rokugo, a town near Mt. 
Fuji that is a center of ivory carving. 
</P>
<P>
Carving name seals, called hanko, is profitable because about 80% are made from 
ivory, which costs more to carve than other materials. 
</P>
<P>
At the Mitsukoshi Department Store in Tokyo, the price of a seal little more 
than half an inch in diameter has increased 11.5%, to the yen equivalent of 
about $253, since the spring of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In Japan, signatures have little importance, and name seals are legal marks of 
identification. The hanko seals are shaped like lipstick cases and have the 
owner's name engraved at one end in Chinese characters, which the Japanese use 
to write their language. 
</P>
<P>
Official documents must be affixed with the name seal, which also is needed to 
open a bank account. A check without the seal is invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Japan joined the international ban on ivory trade just as Rokugo's basic 
industry started to climb out of a 15-year slump, said Kobayashi, who heads 
Rokugo's Council for Promotion of Seal Businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"We did everything possible to prevent an import ban of ivory from going into 
effect," he added. "Now that the ban is decided, nothing can be done about it. 
The industry will have many difficulties on the way ahead." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sort of Japan-bashing because Japanese buyers raise prices of ivory 
tusks on the market," said another artisan, Kenzo Takii, who works in Kofu, 
north of Rokugo. 
</P>
<P>
Takii, who has traveled to Africa seven times to buy ivory tusks, says he feels 
very uncertain about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Rokugo, a mountain town of about 4,800 people, is known as the hometown of 
hanko seals because about half of them are carved there, according to town 
official Masafumi Mochizuki. 
</P>
<P>
About 360 townspeople are engaged in the seal business. Most ivory-carving 
workshops are small, family enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the town made about $14 million selling name seals and related 
products, Mochizuki said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Japan imported 106 tons of unprocessed ivory and 26 tons of finished 
ivory, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. About 53% 
was used for seals, according to the conservation group Traffic (Japan). 
</P>
<P>
It was rumored that dealers, fearing a ban on imports, stockpiled about 100 
tons of ivory, enough for the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
To survive, Kobayashi said, the industry is looking for a substitute for ivory. 
</P>
<P>
Water buffalo horns, boxwood, crystal and onyx are used. However, "Nothing is 
better than ivory," Kobayashi said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ivory meets all the conditions as a material for hanko," he said. "It's 
beautiful to look at. You can engrave ivory easily and beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
But a Mitsukoshi sales clerk said consumers' tastes are quietly changing, 
apparently in response to the ivory-imports ban. He said some prefer seals made 
of the horns of water buffalo and boxwood. 
</P>
<P>
The industry tried using horns of sheep from the high mountains of China and 
Tibet, but found them unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
They even experimented with tusks from the prehistoric mammoth, which Soviet 
dealers in Siberia sell for hard currency. Kobayashi said the quality matched 
that of African elephants but only the center of a tusk can be used, making it 
about twice as expensive as ivory. 
</P>
<P>
Several Japanese companies are encouraging ivory carvers to use platinum or 
gold, which would force carvers to invest in expensive machines.

NATURE RESERVE PROPOSED FOR TIBET PLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A cold, wind-swept plain in Tibet populated with scores of birds, plants and 
animals found nowhere else on Earth has been proposed as the world's largest 
nature reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The Chang Tang Reserve, named from the Tibetan words for "northern plain," 
would encompass an area the size of California. The proposed territory covers 
one-sixth of the Tibet Autonomous Region and adjoining parts of the Chinese 
provinces of Qinghai and Xinjiang, said George Schaller, an American biologist 
who has explored the region and helped negotiate an agreement signed just days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the last, almost unexplored places on the face of the Earth," said 
Schaller, of Wildlife Conservation International in New York. "It survives 
intact almost as it was 100 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Schaller, one of the world's leading wildlife biologists, has done pioneering 
studies on gorillas, pandas, snow leopards and other endangered animals. 
</P>
<P>
He is one of the very few Westerners to have entered the Chang Tang region. Few 
local people have been there, either. Despite its size, it has a human 
population of no more than several hundred wandering herdsmen who live there 
for only a few months each year. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned from Chang Tang in late January, he brought with him an 
agreement with the Tibetan Environmental Protection Agency that outlines the 
steps to be taken to establish the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
An area of 100,000 square miles, about the size of Colorado, will be set aside 
in Tibet. The Tibetan EPA will coordinate the effort, with funds from Wildlife 
Conservation International and Tibetan and national agencies. Proposed 
additions in adjoining provinces would bring the size of the reserve to about 
150,000 square miles, an area just under the size of California. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to, in the next few years, find out what's there and the areas of 
particular importance," Schaller said. He plans to return in July. The research 
will be conducted with the Tibet Institute of Plateau Biology. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls the area "a unique animal and plant community which 
includes such spectacular creatures as wild yak, Tibetan wild ass, Tibetan wild 
sheep, Tibetan gazelle, Tibetan antelope and Tibetan brown bear, all of which 
occur only on the Tibetan plateau." 
</P>
<P>
When asked to describe the region, he paused, searching for comparisons to 
convey the vastness and austere beauty of an area unlike any other. 
</P>
<P>
It has "the aura of the Serengeti" in East Africa, he said. "You travel and 
travel toward a distant horizon, and the world seems to expand in front of 
you." 
</P>
<P>
The reserve is a high-altitude steppe at an elevation of about 3 miles. It is 
covered with scrub grasses no more than 6 inches high, lakes too salty to drink 
from, and jagged, inhospitable mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Winter temperatures can drop to 40 or 50 degrees below zero. Snow can fall any 
day of the year. "And the winds," Schaller said. "Oh, how the winds can howl 
across there." 
</P>
<P>
Four hundred species of plants have been found on the plateau, along with 60 
species of birds. Wild yak gather in herds of 100 or 150. "It's a real desert 
area, but it has oases around which animals congregate" by the thousands, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Access to the reserve is normally by way of Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, a 
week's drive south of the proposed reserve. "I've gone in from the north by 
camel caravan, but you cross such desolate country, it's difficult," Schaller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The trip from Lhasa isn't a simple excursion either. "You need two cars and a 
truck to carry gas," he said. Because of the need to carry gas, expeditions 
normally last no more than three months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My preference would be to just have a herd of yak animals and live in there 
for a few years," he said. "But politically that's not feasible." Schaller is 
willing, but "most of the local people have families and they don't want to be 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an area so remote, is the establishment of a nature reserve really 
necessary? 
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing as a remote area anymore," Schaller said. "It's known 
there are minerals there. Near there oil has been discovered."

INNOCENT TIES TO DRUG DEALERS CAN HURT

Inga Lourey says she has never met a drug trafficker, but for seven months she 
and other business owners unwittingly paid rent to one. 
</P>
<P>
Now they are paying the federal government, which seized the property. 
</P>
<P>
Lourey and her husband, Carl, own a supermarket in the Park II Alto Mesa 
shopping center on El Paso's upscale West Side. Unbeknown to them, the 
$4.3-million center was owned by Rafael Munoz Talavera, considered the "premier 
godfather" of cocaine smuggling from Mexico into the United States, government 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators say he headed a smuggling ring that moved at least 60 
tons of cocaine into the United States during 1989, including the 21.4 tons 
discovered last September in a warehouse in Sylmar, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz Talavera was arrested shortly after the warehouse was seized and now is 
jailed just a few miles from Lourey's store, across the border in Cuidad 
Juarez, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the U.S. Marshals Service seized the shopping center and told the 
Loureys and other merchants who their landlord had been. 
</P>
<P>
Lourey said she had no idea who owned the shopping center. "We just had an 
address we sent the rent to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people doing business with criminals who do not have any 
way of being aware of it at the time," said Steven T. Boyle, spokesman for 
Marshals Service headquarters in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center is one of more than 26,300 properties seized by the 
Marshals Service in 1989 -- from real estate to cars and personal belongings -- 
as the result of drug investigations, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
There is little anyone can do to avoid doing business with a drug dealer, Boyle 
said, since usually the first information linking someone with the illegal 
trade comes out when they're indicted or arrested. 
</P>
<P>
And by then, it probably is too late for the innocent business person to avoid 
feeling the consequences, as the Loureys found out. 
</P>
<P>
When the public learned of the shopping center seizure, some of Lourey's 
customers believed merchants there might be fronts for drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some snide remarks from customers. Some were saying: 'If you're 
involved in laundering money, we're not coming to the store anymore.' Others 
said they would boycott the store," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants became so worried that they got the Marshals Service to issue a 
statement saying their businesses are legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
But Lourey worries that something similar will happen again, and she doubts 
that she could do anything to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
"Shopping centers change hands. If this happens again, are you going to ask 
(the landlord) are you OK? Is your money all right?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle said about the only tip-off to a drug connection is someone trying to buy 
something with a briefcase full of cash. 
</P>
<P>
The man who sold the shopping center said he, too, was a victim. He said he 
sold the property to, and did business only with, Rafael Munoz Tellez, the 
father of Munoz Talavera, not knowing the link. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt my business tremendously. I lost clients. A lot of people in town 
talk," said the property seller, who spoke only on the condition that his name 
not be used. He said more publicity would further erode his business, which is 
just beginning to recover. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center was one of about a dozen residential and commercials 
properties seized in El Paso and Ruidoso, N.M., as a result of the September 
cocaine seizure in California. The federal government will maintain them until 
a court rules whether the suspects must forfeit the properties. 
</P>
<P>
The number of properties seized by the Marshals Service has been escalating 
with the drug war. Seven times as many properties were seized last year than 
were just three years ago -- 3,645 in 1986. Last year's seizures were valued at 
$1.09 billion.

Tulip growers are flooding local waterways in this flower-growing region with 
pesticides, including such banned substances as DDT, to protect their crops, 
water officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"All kinds of pesticides were found in surface waters in the bulb-growing area, 
and their levels were far above the norms in most cases," said Hans van der 
Hoek, a spokesman for the local water management board. 
</P>
<P>
"In samples, we've even found long-banned substances such as DDT, aldrin, and 
dieldrin," Van der Hoek said. 
</P>
<P>
All three are highly toxic substances, but Van der Hoek said it had not been 
determined if the pesticide levels in the water were a threat to public health. 
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the Netherlands' 39,500-acre bulb-growing area lies just north of 
this western Dutch city. The remainder is spread over the northwestern and 
central Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
Van der Hoek said that the water management board had launched a joint study 
with the bulb growers on how to tackle the problem.

Hsu Shao-tan, Taiwan's stripper-turned-politician, was sentenced Friday to 
three months in prison for making a pornographic movie, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Taiwan law, sentences of less than six months can be settled by paying a 
fine -- amounting in Hsu's case to only $310 -- instead of serving the time. 
Hsu did not appear in court for the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
She admitted appearing in the movie but said the nude scenes were not of her 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Hsu narrowly lost a race for a seat in Parliament in December elections. She is 
still awaiting judgment in another case brought after she took off her clothes 
in front of the legislature.

Thatcher Edmunds recalls back in the early 1960s when the stilt structures 
dotting the flats of Biscayne Bay were notorious hangouts for gamblers, boozers 
and flashy women. 
</P>
<P>
Characters such as Plucky Pierre and his right-hand man, Shipwreck Kelly, ran a 
joint called The Bikini Club, where a pink card gained entry for members any 
time of the day or night. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors found their way to the Quarterdeck Club, which was fully equipped with 
a bar, table games, and, for a time, slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours, though, was strictly for family," said Edmunds, who calls his dwelling 
on stilts the "A house."

So-named because of its distinctive A-frame architecture, the faded yellow 
retreat sits in several feet of water along with 13 other such vacation homes 
and weekend retreats off the southern coast of Key Biscayne. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasure boaters cruising Biscayne Bay can hardly miss the stilt homes that 
have become a veritable Miami landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Curious Miamians and visitors alike pass through Stiltsville's natural 
deep-water channels en route to the ocean and sometimes leave slashes in the 
sea grasses after dragging their engines on the bay bottom in the clear, 
shallow water around the homes. 
</P>
<P>
But even with its reputation considerably mellowed and more family oriented, 
Stiltsville will no longer exist at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Residents' leases for quarter-acre underwater sites won't be renewed after July 
1, 1999, by decree of the state. The state allowed the bay bottom to be leased 
through the next decade but prohibited new construction after the Legislature 
passed the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve Act in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking this area, which is close to a large urban area, and returning 
it to its natural state," said Lisa Garvin, spokeswoman for the 173,000-acre 
Biscayne National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although some people have called Stiltsville an eyesore and environmental 
concerns have been raised, Edmunds and others say the homes should be saved. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they're jealous because they can't build," Edmunds said. "We were there 
long before it was a national park. We're not bothering anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Edmunds, 61, a retired trucking company supervisor from Pembroke Pines, shares 
the retreat with three other families. The 40-by 50-foot, three-bedroom house, 
about six miles offshore from Miami and a mile from the Cape Florida 
lighthouse, has stood for 27 years. Hurricane Donna leveled the original 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
Residents now can rebuild homes damaged during storms only if at least 51% of 
the structure remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
It took about a year for the families to build the A-frame house themselves, 
towing scrap lumber and materials to the site in small outboards. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost like homesteading," Edmunds said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, he said, a movie studio featured the house as the base of operations 
for an underwater coal-mining company in the film " 'Round the World Under the 
Sea." Church groups and Boy Scouts also have borrowed the place for special 
retreats. 
</P>
<P>
Don't expect any luxuries here, Edmunds said, though it's the best getaway 
possible still within sight of the Miami skyline. 
</P>
<P>
"You never run out of things to do -- relax, fish, water-ski, dive, or watch 
the boats go by," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no television, no telephone. They catch rainwater for showers and 
washing dishes. Generators provide electricity, and the breeze off the bay 
provides "the world's best air conditioning," Edmunds said as he threw open the 
wooden doors off the combination sitting room-kitchen-dining area. 
</P>
<P>
The bay, its water patches of light green and indigo blue, used to offer some 
of the best bonefishing anywhere before Miami's population boomed, Edmunds 
said. But despite the decline in marine life, it is still easy to catch a 
panful of fish for supper. 
</P>
<P>
"You can cast off the porch any time you want and catch all the fish you want," 
Edmunds said. 
</P>
<P>
Old pictures from family outings cram a large bulletin board inside the wooden 
house, many of them showing bloody sharks bigger than the young boys who caught 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of about 60 years, residents of Stiltsville have often helped 
boaters who became stranded or got caught in a bad storm. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the years I can't imagine how many I've pulled off the flats or helped 
them repair their boats or towed them in," Edmunds said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents pay the state Department of Natural Resources $1,000 annually to 
lease the site. When the first structures began shaping Stiltsville, the bay 
bottom was leased for $1 an acre. The community peaked after World War II, with 
some 20 residences. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some of the structures have fallen into disrepair after years of 
constant exposure to wind and salt spray. 
</P>
<P>
Edmunds said it is a constant battle to keep up his retreat, replacing beams, 
painting and making repairs. He worries about Stiltsville's possible 
deterioration in the next decade because owners may decide that it is not worth 
spending the money for repairs if they'll have to move or tear down the 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
If the state remains committed to eliminating Stiltsville, Edmunds said, it'll 
do more than just take away a slice of paradise for owners in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll take away a lot of pleasure for people who visit," he said. "It's just 
the neatest place in the world."

This town, known as Colorado's Sweetheart City, had a little more sweetness 
than it could handle Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A molasses storage tank sprang a leak before dawn, spilling its gooey contents 
onto city streets and an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
The molasses, stiffened by near-zero temperatures, flowed slowly and more than 
a foot deep about one-half mile down a city street. City officials estimated 
that about 100,000 gallons spilled from the tank, which was at an old sugar 
factory.

STATE TO AUDIT COMPTON'S SCHOOLS ON MEAL PAYMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials announced that they will audit the Compton Unified School 
District's program for feeding low-income children in an effort to determine if 
the district used inflated figures in applying for state and federal 
reimbursements for meals. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal inspectors who visited the district in December said the 
number of low-income meals reported at five schools may have been inflated as 
much as 52%. 
</P>
<P>
Their report said several children apparently were counted more than once, and 
the district failed to provide proper documentation, such as welfare check 
stubs, showing that several children were from low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the state Department of Education's audit division has been asked 
by the department's Child Nutrition and Food Distribution Division to examine 
the district's records starting this week. 
</P>
<P>
Compton officials insisted, however, that they did not submit inflated numbers. 
They said the inspectors misread the computer information that the district 
uses to keep track of the number of children eligible to receive breakfasts and 
lunches free or at reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some discrepancies in their findings," acting Supt. Elisa L. Sanchez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez said the district has made remarkable progress in revamping a food 
service program that was cited in the past for failing to provide wholesome 
meals and keep its records in order. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the report indicates that school meals in Compton meet federal and 
state nutrition requirements. 
</P>
<P>
George Nash, who runs the district's food service program, scoffed at the 
report of inflated meals. "If we were doing 52% inflated, we wouldn't have any 
idea where we were," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash cited the district's November reimbursement check as evidence that the 
district is not claiming it served meals to 30,000 low-income children. The 
district was reimbursed $643,695 for serving 344,928 lunches and 115,278 
breakfasts during the month, he said. That represents lunches for 18,154 
children a day and breakfasts for 6,067, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors, he said, wanted to see paper documentation, but the district 
has spent the past two years transferring its information to computers. The 
district's computer files show that all the children counted for meal 
reimbursements are from low-income families, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute over meal counts may stem from the requirement that districts 
choose 3% of the low-income families at random and demand further verification. 
The additional documentation, such as welfare check stubs, must be kept on file 
in the district, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
The district had not completed the 3% sampling when the inspectors arrived, and 
the inspectors would not accept the computerized information as a substitute, 
Nash said. Since then, he added, the district has completed the required 
sample. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute could cost the district thousands of dollars if it cannot persuade 
the auditors, who are expected to spend four or five days in Compton, that the 
computer files correctly reflect the number of children entitled to receive 
meals free or at reduced prices. Last year, according to state records, the 
district received $5.8 million in state and federal reimbursements for meals 
served to low-income children. 
</P>
<P>
Compton will have to return money to the government if the auditors confirm 
that there are inflated meal counts, said Samuel L. Johnson, head of the audit 
section of the Department of Education. The auditors, Johnson said, intend to 
verify the eligibility of every child that Compton claims is deserving of a 
free or reduced-price meal. 
</P>
<P>
The report on Compton's food service program was compiled by inspectors from 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Child Nutrition and Food 
Distribution Division in the state Department of Education. The two agencies 
inspect a district's food service program every three or four years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a situation like this in the last four or five years where we 
have had to (follow up with) an audit," said Maria Balakshin, director of the 
child nutrition division. 
</P>
<P>
In one section of their report, the inspectors suggested that Compton's 
computer files show that the district is claiming its low-income enrollment is 
as high as 30,000 and that some children showed up three or four times in the 
computer files. Total enrollment in the district, including district-run 
preschools, is about 28,000, according to Nash and district reports filed with 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Nash acknowledged that students' names may appear more than once in the files, 
partly because families move often within the district, filling out new forms 
that are entered in the computer. But at the end of every month the district 
checks for duplicate welfare or Social Security numbers of students, and 
deletes the duplicate entries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since about 95% of the district's students qualify for these meals, district 
officials decided two years ago to provide every child a meal rather than try 
to sort out the few who can pay, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the meal count submitted to the state excludes meals served to children who 
are not eligible for them, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A few other districts have the same policy, Balakshin said, although Compton is 
the largest to do so. 
</P>
<P>
School officials Sanchez and Nash said the food program improved significantly 
after the district hired two companies in 1987 to handle the meals. Marriott 
Corp. and National Business Services Enterprises Inc., a minority-owned 
business in Washington, formed a joint company, United Food Services, to handle 
the Compton contract. The company receives management fees of about $407,000, 
Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
The program's data, including inventory, has been put on computer, meals comply 
with federal and state nutrition standards, and the overhead has dropped, 
Sanchez said.

HISTORIC RIDE;

<P>
FIRST U.S. WOMAN IN SPACE NOW TEACHES, HEADS UCSD SPACE RESEARCH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sally Kristen Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, looks at the headlines these 
days and, like many Americans, reacts with a mixture of marvel and disbelief: 
Communism crumbles in Europe. An enemy of apartheid is freed. Superpowers 
insist on a reduction in nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
Ride, 38, is a pivotal figure in the history of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, which, as much as any tentacle of the government, came to 
symbolize competition with the Soviets. Now, with opportunists from Russia to 
Romania jumping on the capitalist bandwagon, and Japan getting serious about 
space, where does this leave the country that first put people on the moon? 
</P>
<P>
Ride isn't sure, and her reply is one of cautious skepticism. Sitting in her 
office at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where she directs the 
California Space Institute (Cal Space), she simply sighed and shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's well accepted that we have a national shortage in scientists and 
engineers," Ride said last week in a rare interview. "We have a whole range of 
physical sciences and engineering disciplines that are widely recognized to be 
suffering the ills of a serious problem. Both the National Science Foundation 
and the National Academy of Sciences say we're not training enough scientists 
and engineers, and sooner or later we'll suffer the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
A dual concern is the low number of women and minority members entering the 
scientific disciplines. Ride said science -- or, for that matter, the space 
program itself -- has not been made "interesting or attractive enough" to 
children, the only potential astronauts America has. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are very smart, very clever," Ride said. "They can see that most 
scientists are white males, that the stereotype is white males. If the message 
we give, however subtle, is that English or nursing would be better for those 
kids to go into, then those are the fields they'll choose." 
</P>
<P>
Partly because she believes that the educational crisis in America is acute, if 
not severe, Ride chose to abandon her career as an astronaut and return to 
academia. She had received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1978 and 
promptly left for Houston to begin training as a space pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
She participated in two missions of the space shuttle Challenger. In 1983, she 
operated a cargo-handling arm in the shuttle's cargo bay, deploying and 
retrieving a 3,200-pound instrument package. She also helped launch a seven-ton 
communications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Ride, a native of the San Fernando Valley, shared the shuttle with 
grade-school classmate Kathryn D. Sullivan. On Ride's second mission, her 
achievements were partially eclipsed by those of Sullivan, who became the first 
American woman to walk in space. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Challenger explosion in January, 1986, Ride served as a 
member of the presidential panel investigating history's worst space accident. 
In August, 1987, she left NASA for Stanford's Center for International Security 
and Arms Controls. She came to UC San Diego as a physics professor in June and 
now alternates between teaching physics and heading Cal Space, the $3.3-million 
research institute that encompasses all UC campuses from its base in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for UCSD said Ride is paid $55,100 based on a nine-month 
appointment at the university. She receives a $6,000 stipend for her work with 
Cal Space and has the option for an additional $11,644, which she can get by 
teaching summer school. Ride said she hopes to remain at UCSD "quite a long 
time," given that she's a native of Southern California and "that we've got a 
lot to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
She said neither of her parents was a scientist -- her mother was a homemaker, 
her father a political science professor -- but, from the time she was very 
young, she was interested in math and science and in stargazing through a 
telescope, her favorite childhood gift. Her only sibling, a sister, is a 
Presbyterian minister. 
</P>
<P>
Ride has always been interested in writing, she said; she majored in physics 
and English at Stanford, receiving both a bachelor of science and bachelor of 
arts degree. She later wrote a children's book titled "To Space and Back." She 
said she would love to write more, but added with a laugh: "Writing's too hard. 
It's much harder than anything I've done." 
</P>
<P>
Ride confirmed that launch is the most exhilarating, the most frightening, 
moment she has ever experienced, in space or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"The main engine light goes on, and you know you're on the launch pad another 
seven seconds," she said. "The solid rocket light comes on, and you leave the 
pad. It's the most sudden, overwhelming feeling, a feeling of utter and 
complete helplessness. . . . At that point, you're completely in the hands of 
fate." 
</P>
<P>
When the Challenger exploded into fragments not long after Ride's second 
mission, she faced the task of trying to figure out why and offering a 
blueprint of improvements while dealing with "grief work." Just about every 
person on board was an intimate friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Judith Resnick, Dick Scobee, Ronald McNair, Ellison Onizuka. . . . We were all 
very close," she said, her voice trailing off. "Those were the astronauts I 
entered the program with." 
</P>
<P>
Ride believes NASA is now on the right path, given that safety has emerged as 
the highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims of the Challenger explosion was a civilian astronaut, 
schoolteacher Sharon Christa McAuliffe. Ride said she believed at the time that 
to include civilians on shuttle missions was a mistake, perhaps a tragedy in 
the making. She said the advent of space-bound civilians -- even newscaster 
Walter Cronkite and pop singer John Denver were rumored to be going -- was 
grossly premature. 
</P>
<P>
"Veteran astronauts knew that better than anyone," Ride said. 
</P>
<P>
She said a reintroduction of civilians is a good idea, "but its time has yet to 
come. It may be decades. The shuttle is an amazingly high-tech and risky 
vehicle; it's occupied by professionals for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
Ride said she still has the itch to return to space, but figures she probably 
won't. She wanted to return to professorial life even before the tragedy. She 
believes the classroom can be an effective launch pad for all kinds of 
aerospace innovations, many of which she hopes to get started at Cal Space. 
</P>
<P>
Much of her work at Scripps will focus on satellite remote sensing of Earth, 
climatology, propulsion and robotics. Specific projects include cloud effects 
on radiative energy, the El Nino effect, and space and sea automation. Ride 
believes space can play a huge role in helping to preserve the world's rain 
forests and the study of a host of environmental issues.

TOUR DE ROCKWELL; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE FIRM OPENS ITS SANTA SUSANA FACILITY TO SHOW THAT IT IS 
CONDUCTING NUCLEAR RESEARCH AND ROCKET TESTING SAFELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International, criticized by neighborhood and anti-nuclear activists 
concerned about the safety of its nuclear research operations, dropped the veil 
of secrecy Saturday at its Santa Susana field laboratory, opening its gates to 
the public for the first time in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150 rain-soaked people toured the 2,600-acre facility west of Chatsworth 
in what officials called an effort to prove that the rocket testing and nuclear 
research at the site is being conducted in a safe, responsible manner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing this because there is an obvious need for us to reach out to the 
community and show that we operate in a safe manner," said Pat Coulter, 
spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division. "We're proud of what we do up 
here. This is a national asset, and we get a lot of calls from people wanting 
to know more about what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has been the subject of accusations and negative publicity since the 
disclosure last May of a federal Department of Energy report that acknowledged 
the existence of chemical and radioactive contamination in the DOE portion of 
the Santa Susana site. The pollution has been described as mostly low-level, 
but the report greatly increased scrutiny of the facility and raised concern 
among area residents. 
</P>
<P>
The three tours conducted on Saturday marked the first time since 1947 -- when 
Santa Susana was established as a rocket testing site -- that the public had 
been allowed on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers and experts guided busloads of visitors through the rugged, scenic 
terrain, pointing out drab buildings and mammoth towers where engines for the 
Apollo missions and the space shuttle were built and tested. Roars from some of 
the engine tests have often been heard several miles from the location. 
</P>
<P>
Large, round tanks that could hold half a million gallons of hydrogen gas 
loomed over the bus as it cruised the wet roads. 
</P>
<P>
Also included on the tour was the nuclear "hot lab," a heavily shielded 
workshop where nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials are handled by 
remote control. 
</P>
<P>
The tour guides -- Frank Will, manager of equipment engineering, and Gerry 
Gaylord, manager of facility programming at the company's Energy Technology 
Engineering Center -- assured passengers that most of the nuclear facilities on 
the site were inactive, and 97% of the radioactive contamination in the soil 
and building had been cleared away. 
</P>
<P>
The hot lab is scheduled to be shut down in October after current work is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bus passed through most of the acreage of the test site during the 
hourlong tour, passengers were not shown the inside of any building and were 
not allowed off the bus until the end of the tour for a question-and-answer 
session with company officials. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the tour resembled a visit to Universal Studios. Will pointed out two 
boulders on a hillside "that you may recognize. That's where 'The Six Million 
Dollar Man' and 'Wonder Woman' were filmed." 
</P>
<P>
None of the activists who had criticized the work at the site attended the 
day's first tour, even though a few said they were invited. 
</P>
<P>
One activist, Don Wallace, called the tours "an outrageous public relations 
stunt." 
</P>
<P>
Another activist, Jon Scott, who had intervened in Rockwell's license hearings 
before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said: "I would love to go in a way. I 
would love to have the concession on gas masks. All these folks want to do is 
do a song-and-dance about NASA and avoid the contamination part." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers on the first tour were watchful but calm. When Coulter 
asked what everyone had thought of the tour, the group applauded. 
</P>
<P>
John Weems, who lives in Dayton Canyon, said he had gone because he wanted to 
learn more about radiation and soil contamination. He said a neighbor had 
drilled a well near his house, and sodium contamination from the well had 
killed nearby trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to know if the same kind of thing was happening here," he said. "But 
it seems pretty safe. They took us to all the places I had read about in the 
newspaper, so they were pretty honest." 
</P>
<P>
Robin Barr, who went with her parents, said she was satisfied that the 
operation was safe but added, "I think they could build more wells up here so 
that the contamination could be cleaned up as they go along." 
</P>
<P>
Another passenger, Elaine Riley, said the safety of the operation was the least 
of her concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to see the rock formations," she said. "They were beautiful. Too 
bad this place isn't open for hiking."

TENTATIVE DEAL STRUCK ON HOTEL, OFFICE CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: THE 'JUNGLELAND' JOINT VENTURE AWAITS A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE 
CITY AND DEVELOPER. OPPONENTS INSIST THAT TAXPAYERS ARE AT RISK.

<P>
A tentative agreement has been reached between the city of Thousand Oaks and a 
private developer on plans to build a hotel-office complex next to a new City 
Hall and performing arts center. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement could come before the City Council as soon as lawyers draft a 
contract, spokesmen for the city and the Lowe Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
The project managers declined to elaborate on the proposal until it is 
submitted to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But they acknowledged that, in general, it involves the city's redevelopment 
agency leasing land to the Lowe company to build the hotel-office complex. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed development is known as the "Jungleland" project because it is 
planned for a vacant 20-acre site at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Conejo School 
Road that was once the home of the wild-animal theme park. 
</P>
<P>
The joint-venture agreement will be submitted to the City Council in about two 
months, culminating more than two years of negotiations with Lowe, said Ed 
Johnduff, the city administrator overseeing the project. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three activists who are longtime critics of the project threatened a 
lawsuit last week unless the city discloses details of its negotiations with 
Lowe and how much public funding the project would require. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens, whose attempt to place the issue before voters two years ago was 
rejected by the city, reasserted during a news conference last week that the 
project was financially doomed and would require substantial taxpayers' 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Previous efforts to obtain detailed financial information have been rebuffed, 
said the group's leader, Heinrich (Corky) Charles, who has retained a Riverside 
attorney and acknowledged that he hopes to renew a referendum drive. 
</P>
<P>
"The citizens of Thousand Oaks are entitled to a full and free public debate of 
the project on its merits," said Charles' attorney, John Brown. "It is not 
acceptable for the city to negotiate in secret for two years and then give the 
public only a couple of weeks review." 
</P>
<P>
Estimated costs for the Jungleland project have changed over the years, and 
Johnduff said nothing is certain at this point. 
</P>
<P>
But he said last week that the city's portion is expected to cost $60 million 
for a new City Hall, an 1,800-seat performance center, a parking deck, 
landscaping and street and sewer additions. 
</P>
<P>
The privately developed hotel and office complex is expected to cost about $40 
million, for a total project cost of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Johnduff acknowledged that a proposed endowment fund for the performing arts 
center, the interest of which would support the facility's operating costs, had 
not yet received any donations. 
</P>
<P>
The final cost of the project's land also remains uncertain because a lawsuit 
concerning its value is still pending in Ventura Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by the site's former owner against the city, is scheduled for 
trial April 9. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already paid $12.75 million for the land, which it condemned in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
But former owner Assadollah Morovati has claimed that he is entitled to $26 
million, representing both the land and its potential value had he been allowed 
to develop it. 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately, when the figures come in, we will prevail," said project critic 
Joan Gorner, who joined Heinrich and Richard Booker at the news conference last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Heinrich is a former Thousand Oaks planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Gorner, Charles and Booker said they recently learned through requests for 
public information that a written agreement between the city and Lowe to 
negotiate exclusively with each other had expired more than a year ago and was 
not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they said, city officials had refused to disclose details of the 
negotiations, leading them to believe that talks had either reached an impasse 
after two years or that Lowe was no longer interested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Johnduff acknowledged that the city's written negotiation agreement had been 
allowed to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
But he said neither side felt renewal was necessary since negotiations were 
under way and both sides appeared to trust each other. 
</P>
<P>
Ted McGonagle, an assistant vice president for Lowe in charge of the Jungleland 
proposal, said last week that his company was still committed to the project 
and felt that it was financially feasible.

EX-SCHOOL CHIEF NAMED TO HOSPITAL DISTRICT BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Riewer, a Redondo Beach resident and former superintendent of the South 
Bay Union High School District, was appointed Friday to the board of the South 
Bay Hospital District. 
</P>
<P>
He was named to fill former board member Mary Davis' unexpired term, which runs 
until November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a board member since 1983, resigned in January. The district grants 
money for public health programs in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Manhattan 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital board member during the 1970s, Riewer was a compromise choice after 
the board failed to break a deadlock between candidates Dick Fruin, a former 
board member who was defeated for reelection in 1984 and failed in a 1986 
attempt to return to the board, and Jeremy Evans, a former legal counsel to the 
hospital district. 
</P>
<P>
Riewer, who was appointed on a 4-0 vote, said the action "came as a complete 
surprise. . . . It kind of tickles my funny bone." Currently a member of the 
Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, he headed the high school 
district from 1970 until retiring in 1979.

LAWNDALE CANDIDATE FACES ARREST WARRANT FOR SPEEDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary McDonald, a former Lawndale planning commissioner and a candidate for City 
Council in the April 10 election, faces a misdemeanor arrest warrant for a 
speeding ticket he received in Inglewood in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant was issued last April 27 in Inglewood Municipal Court after 
McDonald failed to meet an April 13 deadline to provide proof that he had 
attended traffic school, court officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald can avoid arrest by providing that proof or by paying a $243 fine, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said Friday that he attended Aids Driving School in Lawndale in 
January, 1989, and that it is possible he did not send documentation to the 
court. He said he paid in cash and does not have a canceled check to show he 
attended the school, but he said he will clear up the problem on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which is headquartered in Santa Ana, has since closed its Lawndale 
branch. Rob Blamey, a spokesman for the school, said he has been unable to find 
a record of McDonald's attendance. But he said it is possible that records 
might have been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
Council members and other candidates in the April election said McDonald should 
be held accountable for the violation. 
</P>
<P>
"If he is going to be a council member he should pay his tickets," said 
Councilman Dan McKenzie, a longtime supporter who signed McDonald's nomination 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics said that McDonald, who has made a point of personally 
investigating alleged wrongdoing by city employees, should not ignore the law 
as it applies to him. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Rhodes, a community activist and mayoral candidate in the upcoming 
election, said: "People who live in glass houses should not throw stones." 
</P>
<P>
The warrant stems from a ticket McDonald received on Jan. 10, 1989. On that day 
Inglewood police stopped him in the 800 block of Main Street for driving 43 
m.p.h. in a 25 m.p.h. zone. 
</P>
<P>
According to court officials, McDonald had until April 13 to show that he had 
attended traffic school. But the deadline passed, and when Inglewood court 
officials had still received no word from McDonald by April 27 they issued the 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald played down the significance of the warrant and said his critics and 
challengers should concentrate on the issues in the election and not on 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was a murder warrant or a robbery warrant, I would understand; but this 
is petty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime supporter Councilman Larry Rudolph agreed. "There are issues out 
there. Why can't they talk about the issues?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Councilwoman Carol Norman, a vocal critic of McDonald, said the 
warrant and other past incidents indicate a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to feel he is above laws," she said. "There is a certain arrogance in 
his behavior." 
</P>
<P>
In December, McDonald was criticized by Mayor Sarann Kruse for operating his 
development consulting business for almost six months without a business 
license. McDonald renewed his license a week after a Times reporter asked him 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Kruse accused McDonald of plagiarism in a campaign statement he wrote 
for Councilman Harold Hofmann. McDonald later issued a public apology, saying 
he thought lines he copied from Kruse were common phrases that could be used 
without attribution. "I realize now I was totally wrong," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Often described by critics as a zealot who tries to interfere in city business 
without respect to due process, McDonald has nonetheless conducted several 
one-man investigations that have resulted in disciplinary actions or dismissal 
of city employees. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it was McDonald's research of city records that prompted an 
investigation of an alleged scheme by city maintenance workers to embezzle 
money and property. Last month the district attorney's office filed four felony 
charges against a former maintenance supervisor who allegedly headed the 
scheme.

DIGEST/ LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RICOCHETING BULLET STRIKES MAN IN CHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Clarita man who locked himself in his bathroom after an argument 
Saturday was hit by a ricocheting bullet after his girlfriend fired at the 
door's lock, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Espetia, 23, was shot in the chin about 2:13 a.m. and taken to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Community Hospital, where he was in stable condition Saturday 
afternoon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet went through the door, ricocheted off the sink and hit Espetia. 
</P>
<P>
His girlfriend, Gregoria Granados, 23, was arrested on suspicion of discharging 
a firearm in a grossly negligent manner. 
</P>
<P>
"She told him if he refused to come out, she was going to shoot the lock and 
she did," said Deputy John Bayliss. 
</P>
<P>
Granados was free on $5,000 bail Saturday night. The shooting occurred in 
Espetia and Granados' home in the 18800 block of Mandan Avenue, authorities 
said.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: DREXEL WAS NO SURPRISE BUT MARKET'S CALM WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What was the biggest surprise last week? To many on Wall Street, it wasn't that 
Drexel Burnham Lambert was forced into bankruptcy. That was expected. 
</P>
<P>
More surprising was that the financial markets reacted as calmly as they did as 
Drexel was going out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed at how the Drexel event was absorbed without a ripple," says Donald 
Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group. "It does 
seem that somebody in Washington has done a good bid of homework since 1987 to 
handle special events." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the stock and bond markets barely shrugged this past Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday as Drexel was self-destructing brought out the conspiracy 
theories. These are the same theories that surfaced Oct. 16, the first trading 
day after the Oct. 13 mini-crash. And the theories are similar to those 
expressed by many after the crash of October, 1987, when people speculated that 
somehow the government intervened to stabilize stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The government has always denied that it would interfere in the stock market, 
and nothing can prove that to the contrary. But that didn't stop some market 
pros last week from suspecting that the subtle hand of Washington was again at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, for instance, the stock index futures markets were buzzing with 
rumors that Washington was putting pressure on big trading houses to give the 
market a lift. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard those rumors," says one futures trader. "I don't think the government 
is pressuring people to buy. Maybe there is a certain amount of jawboning and 
encouragement not to force the market down." 
</P>
<P>
There could, of course, be another explanation for the nonchalance. Drexel has 
been in trouble for a long time, and the markets may have already made price 
adjustments in case of its demise. 
</P>
<P>
"The (bankruptcy) filing was largely anticipated by the market," says James 
Rosenfeld, finance professor at Emory University. "Everybody was aware of the 
financial woes." In fact, Rosenfeld feels that the markets may have skipped 
right over the bad news and started looking at the bright side. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve may have to reduce interest rates to keep other Wall Street 
firms solvent, says Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
But keep the Drexel situation in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Interest rates are all that the financial markets really care about. If the 
Drexel bankruptcy had affected borrowing costs, then it would have been of 
major importance to the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks ahead -- when Drexel is long forgotten -- Wall Street will still 
be concerned about rising foreign interest rates and this nation's sluggish 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
And unless there is a sudden improvement in rates there or the economy here, 
the stock market will still be on shaky ground. 
</P>
<P>
Where are interest rates going? John Paulus, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s chief 
economist, said last week that he thinks they'll climb. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Coniston Bid for UAL May Depend on Arbs 
</P>
<P>
Are Coniston Partners' chances of beating UAL Corp.'s board in a proxy battle 
slipping away? 
</P>
<P>
Coniston and UAL would agree that the number of shares of the airline company 
in the hands of arbitragers, or speculators, has fallen dramatically in the 
past few months. Arbs, of course, are the natural allies of Coniston in any 
proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston and UAL try to keep track of the holdings of arbs through informal 
surveys. Last week, UAL's proxy solicitation firm, Kissel-Blake Inc., quietly 
called arbs and, I'm told, estimated that these speculators hold about 6 
million of UAL's 22 million outstanding shares. At the peak, they were believed 
to have owned 9.5 million to 10 million. But the sharp plunge in UAL's stock in 
recent months has caused many to liquidate. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston Partners, which has been threatening a proxy fight since last year, 
owns 2.6 million UAL shares. That means that if Coniston decides to go forward 
with a proxy contest -- or its close cousin, a consent solicitation -- it would 
have to win the vote of approximately 2.5 million shares to achieve a majority. 
</P>
<P>
While it is still very likely that Coniston will win, any further reduction in 
the number of shares held by arbs won't make the effort any easier. It could be 
especially difficult to oust the board if Coniston can't come up with an 
alternative that UAL shareholders find more attractive than whatever the 
company's board ends up proposing. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston was to have begun a consent solicitation in January, but it backed off 
from that threat when it looked as though UAL was making progress in its 
efforts for a buyout led by management and the airline's unions. 
</P>
<P>
It is now February, and UAL is still trying to structure some sort of buyout or 
restructuring. A couple of times each week, Coniston, the unions representing 
UAL employees and the company's management get together at the New York offices 
of First Boston Corp., the investment banking firm, to discuss the situation. 
While these meeting are supposed to be secret, Wall Street keeps very close 
tabs of when they occur. The only thing that Wall Street doesn't know is the 
amount of progress being made behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston is said to be happy with the progress of the talks. That's why there 
hasn't been much gossip lately about a proxy battle. But if Coniston should 
become dissatisfied at some point, it is going to wish it had more help from 
arbs. 
</P>
<P>

Long-Distance Carriers Not Much Different 
</P>
<P>
You've seen the commercials: A guy on a pay phone tries to call Phoenix and 
accidentally gets Fiji. He becomes so frustrated that he vows to go back to the 
good service of AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
MCI Communications makes similar claims for the quality of its long-distance 
telephone service. So does US Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
Which service is really the best? Smith Barney, Harris Upham recently surveyed 
managers of corporate telephone systems and found that there really isn't much 
difference in quality. 
</P>
<P>
Smith Barney says it sent out 110 questionnaires in its second annual survey. 
Of the 52 people who returned them, 48 said they managed annual budgets of $1 
million or more. 
</P>
<P>
The managers were asked to rate the long-distance carriers on a scale of 1 to 5 
(with 5 being best) in network quality, service and sales. In quality, AT&amp;T 
got a 4.2 rating, Sprint 3.9. and MCI 3.5. AT&amp;T also led in service with a 
3.6 rating, followed by Sprint and MCI tied at 3.3. In sales, Sprint led with 
3.4, AT&amp;T was second at 3.2 and MCI third with 3.1. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, AT&amp;T's rating was 4.2, Sprint's 3.9 and MCI's 3.5. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Charles Schelke, who conducted the poll, concluded that the 
long-distance phone companies were "generally comparable." He told clients in a 
report called TeleTrends that "while all carriers now appear to be providing 
satisfactory service, no one is consistently providing exceptional service." 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, AT&amp;T did moderately better in this survey than in a similar 
poll Smith Barney conducted a year earlier. MCI did a tiny bit better, and 
Sprint's rate was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>

Beware Greenspan's Soothing Forecasts 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pulled off a magic trick a few weeks 
ago when he calmed a jittery stock market and pacified Congress by saying the 
chances of an economic recession have been reduced. But just how good a 
forecaster has Greenspan been? 
</P>
<P>
Take a look at his predictions in 1981, the last time that the nation's economy 
slipped into a recession, and you'll see that sometimes his crystal ball gets a 
little foggy. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1981, Greenspan -- then a private economist but also an unofficial 
adviser to President Reagan -- predicted that the U.S.' gross national product 
would grow 0.7% in the third quarter. But by August, Greenspan had dramatically 
changed his opinion -- predicting, instead, that GNP would decline 1.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The change came after a government report in July said business conditions were 
weakening. According to the Commerce Department, the GNP actually grew by 1.8% 
in third quarter 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan further predicted that April that GNP would grow 3.6% in the fourth 
quarter. But by August he was predicting a decline of 0.2%. The economy 
actually declined 5.5% that quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Also in that month, Greenspan predicted that the U.S. economy would grow by 
3.8% in the first quarter of 1982. He changed that estimate in August to an 
increase of just 0.8%. GNP actually declined 5.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Two successive quarters of contraction -- as happened in the fourth quarter of 
1981 and the first quarter of 1982 -- are popularly defined as a recession. 
Greenspan had correctly predicted an economic downturn (albeit a slight one), 
but it did take two tries and a little hint from the government before he got 
it right. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's prediction of a rebound in the first quarter of 1982, of course, 
was way off target. 
</P>
<P>
His record got a little better in the second quarter of 1982. Greenspan's 
revised estimate of a 3.5% gain in the second quarter of 1982 wasn't too far 
off the actual 1.2% growth experienced in that period. But Greenspan went back 
to his losing ways with his long-range prediction for the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's revised forecast in August, 1981, was for 4.3% growth in the third 
quarter of 1982. The economy actually declined 3.2% that quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the closest Greenspan had come to spotting a recession was his 
prediction of a decline in GNP in the third and fourth quarters of 1981. But he 
was forecasting a short, painless downturn. The recession actually lasted, 
according to the Commerce Department, from July, 1981, to November, 1982. And 
it was anything but painless. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, one hopes, has a better feel for the economy now that he has access 
to all those government statistics. But the financial markets should also 
remember that a Fed chairman can't always be as candid as he'd like to be -- 
especially if he is trying to calm a jittery nation.

The euphoria over the political miracle in Eastern Europe is fading as the 
magnitude of its problems emerges. There is still much political work to be 
done, and everything could still go wrong. Increasingly, however, the focus of 
attention is shifting to economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the economic problems will be those of short-term crisis management: 
containing hyper-inflation in Poland, stopping the hemorrhaging of skilled 
labor in East Germany, securing desperately needed foreign exchange almost 
everywhere. These are simple problems to understand, but they are difficult to 
solve. And if things go badly, no deeper issues will arise. Suppose, however, 
that in the next year or two things go well enough that the democracies in 
embryo survive and are ready to face the task of building a new society. What 
happens next? 
</P>
<P>
Arguably that's when the real problems begin. For if it survives its immediate 
crisis, the next task facing newly democratic Eastern Europe will be that of 
building a market economy -- which means building capitalism. This is a task 
that nobody has tried before. Everywhere else in the world, capitalism grew 
more or less organically. And when Eastern Europeans see capitalism, they 
probably won't like it. I don't like it much myself. Unfortunately, there's no 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when Western economists tossed around the idea that the 
acknowledged virtues of a market economy could be achieved without the 
perceived vices of private ownership and great inequality of wealth. The 
American economist Abba Lerner and the Polish economist Oskar Lange proposed 
the idea of "market socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Under this system, the managers of state-owned enterprises would be instructed 
to act as if they were capitalists, choosing prices, outputs and inputs so as 
to maximize accounting profits. Instead of a centrally planned economy, one 
would have a decentralized system that responded to consumer demands. The 
difference from a capitalist society, however, would be that nobody would 
derive his income from profits. Managers of state firms would play at being 
capitalists, but at day's end they would return their winnings to society and 
be rewarded only with a modest salary and the regard of comrades. 
</P>
<P>
But market socialism was never tried -- partly because it conflicted with 
Marxist dogma, but also because it was ultimately unworkable. You can't really 
simulate a market system, with profits and losses as just scores in a game, for 
one overwhelming reason: risk. Firms may do badly either because they are badly 
managed or because they are unlucky. Suppose that a firm under market socialism 
does badly. Will you penalize the manager? If you don't, you provide no 
incentive for good management. If you do, you encourage managers always to play 
it safe, never to take risks. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to encourage risk taking where it is appropriate, without 
absolving managers from the consequences of their actions, is to place ultimate 
decision-making power in each firm in the hands of someone who will receive 
handsome rewards if the firm succeeds -- and lose massively if it does not. And 
it is not sufficient simply to promise these consequences, since these promises 
will not be credible (There will always be a temptation to bail out the 
unsuccessful and to try to appropriate part of the gains of the successful): 
The reward for success must be a right, and the penalty for failure automatic. 
</P>
<P>
But someone who holds decision-making power over a firm, bears the firm's risk 
and is entitled to the rewards if the firm's ventures bear fruit, is -- 
whatever name you may call him -- effectively the firm's owner. In other words, 
a market economy cannot really function without capitalists. It can provide a 
safety net to keep people from falling too far and a progressive tax system to 
limit their rise; but even the most welfare-oriented market economies have a 
basic capitalist ethos that is completely foreign to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
And now we come to the problem. Eastern Europe needs a market economy. A market 
economy must be a capitalist economy. But capitalism is, when one really comes 
down to it, not a very attractive system. Because the essence of private 
ownership is the need to couple risk with responsibility, capitalism is 
inherently unfair: It is a system of "from each according to his ability, to 
each according to his luck." Because great rewards must be offered to induce 
the taking of great risks, capitalism is also inherently a system of great 
inequality, of often undeserved wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the rage of the East Germans against their rulers has been fed by 
revelations of corruption, of the luxurious lifestyles of high officials. Yet 
surely I am not the only one who has noticed how relatively modest the revealed 
luxury sounds. Ten-room houses! Four cars! The East Germans simply have no idea 
what a truly unequal society is like. 
</P>
<P>
I would guess offhand that virtually any senior vice president at a Fortune 500 
corporation lived more lavishly in 1988 than all but the very highest officials 
in Eastern Europe. There are tens of thousands of people in America and even in 
Western Europe who have achieved wealth through such doubtfully productive 
professions as risk arbitrage and real estate speculation on a scale that is 
probably inconceivable to Eastern Europeans. When they see how much inequality 
capitalism generates, there is bound to be a backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, how do we get there from here? These countries do not start from 
scratch. Who gets to own the existing capital? Privatization in Eastern Europe 
will not be like selling the phone company in Britain, where there are wealthy 
investors prepared to bid. In Poland or Romania, there is nobody to sell the 
assets to, except possibly to foreign investors. And as the apparent debacle 
over the Gdansk shipyards indicates, this too will not be easy. Be prepared for 
years of bitter controversy. 
</P>
<P>
And yet there is no alternative. Eastern Europe must turn to markets not only 
to prosper, but also because democracy requires a decentralized market economy. 
That means that Eastern Europe must embrace capitalism -- a system that is 
unjust, unequal, unattractive and unavoidable.

Flanigan and all other critics of the public schools must remember that schools 
are a reflection of society.

<P>
As long as we seek instant gratification and instant wealth, there will be a 
problem with education. Generations laughed at the Protestant work ethic, and 
now we have a generation that values neither work nor ethics. When this 
changes, education will improve.

NO SORORITIES -- NO ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm a sorority member at UC Santa Barbara, and I think Middlebury College's 
plan to force fraternities to become co-ed is off-target. I have seen the 
benefits of a single-sex organization. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure of the opposite sex, as we all know, can be distracting; thus I 
feel that making fraternities co-ed would pose a threat to their goal of 
brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
If they have to accept women, that is forced friendship. Sexism is a universal 
problem -- it's not going to be changed by changing the structure of the Greek 
system. 
</P>
<P>
At UCSB, the Greek system has addressed the issue of discrimination head-on. 
Each house has educational programs, and the system as a whole has committees 
such as Greeks against rape. We also work closely with Status of Women, a 
committee of our associated students. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, sororities and fraternities have many avenues in which to work 
together. And to top it off, fraternities are aware that sexist behavior will 
lead to the revoking of their national charter. Thus, our system goes to show 
that there are positive ways to address sexism without having to change the 
traditional structure. I suggest Middlebury think twice before it makes the 
mistake of forcing fraternities to go co-ed. It won't solve a thing; in fact, 
it will probably make men resent women more.

ROGER SIMON: RAPE: CLOTHING IS NOT THE CRIMINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can sit in my living room and turn to a cable TV channel and watch local high 
school girls cavorting on pompon squads. 
</P>
<P>
I can turn to ESPN and watch the national cheerleading championships. 
</P>
<P>
And any spectator can watch pompon squads and cheerleaders at all college and 
most professional sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Also, during the last presidential election campaign, George Bush and Mike 
Dukakis had pompon girls and cheerleaders at many, many rallies. 
</P>
<P>
The activity is seen by most people as fresh, wholesome, festive, and 
entertaining as well as good exercise for the participants. 
</P>
<P>
But week before last, a task force on campus rape at the University of Illinois 
said the school's pompon squad should be abolished because it could lead to 
sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
I think that conclusion is wrong and I think it is wrong in an important way. I 
am sure the task force wants to protect women. But I think its conclusion can 
put women in danger. 
</P>
<P>
I'll tell you why: 
</P>
<P>
The report (which also dealt with alcohol consumption at sporting events) says 
a pompon squad "projects women as sexual objects" and creates an "environment 
that engenders sexual abuse." 
</P>
<P>
The task force was studying the serious problem of campus rape. The university 
found that 16.4% of the 537 women who responded to a survey said they had been 
victims of criminal sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
That's an appallingly high figure. The other appalling figure is that 64% of 
the rapes and 73% of the sexual abuse cases were committed in fraternity 
houses, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
What does this have to do with pompon squads? Well, according to the task 
force, such assaults may have something to do with the skimpy costumes the 
squad members wear and the dance routines they do. 
</P>
<P>
"The research I know of connects sexual assault with men getting the idea that 
women are there as sexual objects," Laurna Rubinson, an associate professor of 
health and safety studies, who chaired the task force, said. "If women are 
there as sexual objects, they can be taken advantage of sexually." 
</P>
<P>
I do not question Rubinson's motives or her obvious concern for the safety of 
women. But I think she is drawing the wrong conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
I think she is dangerously close to saying women are at least partly 
responsible for their own rapes. 
</P>
<P>
I don't believe that. I don't think wearing a leotard and dancing make a woman 
guilty of her own sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
I believe rapists are guilty of rapes. The crime originates with them, not with 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
There was a terrible example in Florida just a few months ago. Last October, 
Steven Lord, 26, was acquitted of the knife-point rape of a 22-year-old woman 
because jurors felt the woman's clothing -- a tank top and a short sheer 
white-lace skirt without underwear -- suggested that she had "asked for it." 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, her outraged lawyer said: "Every time a female goes out 
alone, does she have to look in the mirror and think is the dress appropriate 
or does it risk violence?" 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Lord pleaded guilty to the knife-point rape of a Georgia 
woman, whom he had kidnaped from a 24-hour banking machine. According to court 
records, Lord told the victim: "It's your fault. You're wearing a skirt." 
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to life in prison. He will be eligible for parole after seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
I remember writing columns about rape victims 15 years ago when it was tough to 
get such stories in newspapers. And in all too many jurisdictions, prosecutors 
didn't want to prosecute, juries didn't want to convict and judges didn't want 
to sentence rapists. The woman, all too many of them felt, was partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
I thought we had progressed some in the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Do I think a tank top and short sheer white lace skirt without underwear is 
proper street attire. No, I don't. I think it's tacky. 
</P>
<P>
But such attire does not say: "Please rape me. I am asking for it." 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing a woman can wear that asks someone to rape her. Not the 
body-hugging costumes of pompon squads or the short skirts of cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Men who rape are violent criminals. They are not looking for sex objects. They 
are looking for victims upon which to perpetrate a violent act. 
</P>
<P>
You can argue all you want to about pompon squads. You can make a case, I 
suppose, that they demean women and should be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
But don't make the case that wearing a pompon costume and doing a dance invites 
attack. That blames the wrong person. 
</P>
<P>
Blame the criminal. 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame the victim.

CANVAS BAGS BEAT PAPER AND PLASTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connie Koenenn's Feb. 4 article, "Is It in the Bag? No Easy Winner in the Paper 
vs. Plastic Dilemma," was, for the most part, well done. 
</P>
<P>
However, I must fault her for neglecting to mention the best alternative of all 
-- canvas. Like many of my friends, I have bought sturdy canvas bags which I 
use to tote my groceries home from the market. In this way, I completely avoid 
the paper/plastic quandary. 
</P>
<P>
Although I've been a recycler since the age of 8, I realize that reuse, 
whenever possible, is preferable to recycling, since recycling uses energy in 
the processing of materials and the trucks that haul recyclable materials to 
processing sites contribute to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling is better than wasting, but reusing and doing with less -- fewer 
things and less convenience -- are the most environmentally sensitive 
alternatives.

CANVAS BAGS BEAT PAPER AND PLASTIC

<P>
I wonder if you as journalists and the leaders of powerful environmental groups 
are too busy concentrating on the problems we face in relationship to the 
environment and are unwilling to look to some solutions. 
</P>
<P>
There are two companies in San Diego that are now marketing reusable shopping 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
One company, Treesavers, makes theirs from canvas (that have) been picked up by 
the Big Bear grocery chain, which is taking a very active and committed role 
concerning the environment. These are people making a difference. 
</P>
<P>
The question I have is why do the so-called leaders of these environmental 
groups so easily and relentlessly go to war with corporate America with their 
boycotts instead of focusing their attentions on the solutions that are so 
blatantly in our faces. I also ask why you at The Times as our voice and ears 
of what's going on report these wars and all their newsworthy ramifications and 
ignore the people who are making a difference. Why isn't there a picture of a 
reusable shopping bag on the cover of the article to show people how much we 
can do so easily?

ON VIEW: AMBASSADOR'S VISIT IS SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Jacques Andreani, ambassador of France to the United States, arrived in 
Los Angeles, he and his wife Donatella buzzed to Orange County. They wanted to 
visit Orange High School, where she was an American Field Service exchange 
student in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the couple (she in Dior black and white polka dots with a clump of 
the Dior emblematic lily of the valley flowers on her shoulder) attended the 
party French Consul Gen. Gerard Coste and his wife, Naomi, gave in their 
Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier the ambassador had addressed the Los Angeles World Affairs Council, and 
later the couple was feted at a sit-down dinner hosted by Howard Ruby. 
Prominent at the consular residence were Dr. Franklin and Judith Murphy, Los 
Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce President Ray Remy, Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art Director Rusty Powell, author Annie Cohen-Solal (head of French Cultural 
Services in the United States), Marcia Weisman and Elin Vanderlip, wearing her 
Commandeur des Arts and Lettres, and en route to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
STAR: World-renowned paleoanthropologist Richard E. Leakey, new director of the 
Kenya Wildlife Services, was in demand last week. The Greater Los Angeles Zoo 
Assn. brought him to town to speak on the rapid decline of Kenyan elephants (a 
drop of 140,000 in 1970 to 20,000 now, says Leakey) and rhinos at a Century 
Towers dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Leakey became controversial last July when he made the dramatic decision to 
torch 13 tons of elephant tusks his department had confiscated in order to 
promote a ban on ivory. The zoo affair was a benefit for its endangered species 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
The evening before, Bob and Donna Tuttle and their friends -- Brad Freeman, 
Bill and Tallie Mingst, Joe and Sally Keon, Bill and Nadine Tilley, and Richard 
and Beth Rogers -- invited a coterie to meet Leakey at their new home in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The evening was also a polite invitation to write checks directly to Leakey, 
who is traveling worldwide to raise millions to hire rangers and equip them 
with automatic rifles, helicopters and aircraft to eliminate poachers and 
protect parks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the listeners: Stuart and Carrie Ketchum, Virginia and Mary Milner, Alec 
and Jocelyn Wildenstein, Kathleen and Tom McCarthy, and Tam and Donald 
Dickerson. Leakey told them he hopes to borrow $250 million from the World Bank 
and other financial institutions, and is promising 25% will go to rural 
development to improve schools, housing and roads. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: Peter and Pam Mullin entertained at a black-tie dinner at Los Angeles 
Country Club for Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of 
all Ireland . . . . Walter and Lee Annenberg (he's former ambassador to 
England; she's former U. S. chief of protocol) will be spotlighted when 
University of Pennsylvania President Sheldon Hackney and Southern California 
alumni toast the 250th anniversary of the university March 9 at the Beverly 
Hills Hotel . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan receives an honorary doctorate from the American

</P>
<P>
GLEAM: At the Diadames (the gourmet society) "Gem of a Luncheon" chaired by 
Pauline Naftzger, Joni Smith, Sarah Yort, Margaret Spillane, Mary Skouras and 
president Mary Davis at the Regency Club, New York jewelry designer Christopher 
Walling was getting raves on his X-shaped (with pave diamonds) Biwa pearls and 
charming guests with his tales of sky-diving. 
</P>
<P>
Joni Smith selected the menu with an elegant taco. Social stalwarts spotted: 
Topsy Doheny, Rita Barrett, Marilyn Cavanagh, Marion Jorgensen, Diane Anderson, 
Katy Shattuck, Geri Frawley, Chase Mishkin. 
</P>
<P>
HEARTS: Ruth Mann, 91, a founder in 1931 of the Women's Auxiliary, California 
Pediatric and Family Medical Center, was honored at a fund-raiser at Bel Age 
Hotel for her lifetime community commitment to aid inner-city families. It was 
also the center's 70th birthday. Celebrating were Robert Girard, benefit 
chairwoman Heather and James Shuemaker, Timi and Gordon Freshman . . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Heart Ball for the American Heart Assn., Greater Los Angeles Affiliate, 
Inc., netted more than $330,000 (about $130,000 over last year), and Natalie 
Cole (nominated for two Grammys) was a sensation with "I Live for Your Love." 
At the Regent Beverly Wilshire, Dick and Maude Ferry and Peter and Pam Mullin 
(the men were dinner co-chairmen), and ball chairwoman Carolyn Miller and 
husband Chuck, as well as silent auction chairwoman Aileen Henry and husband 
Guy, were deserving of all those hugs going around . . . . The Cultural Society 
gala co-chairwomen Gloria Thompson and Barbara Davis built a Valentine 
"Stairway to the Stars" at their benefit at Warner Center Marriott in Woodland

ERMA BOMBECK: SIGNS SAY GOD IS NOT A VEGETARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Food shoppers are being faced with a major decision these days. Should they buy 
a zucchini or make the house payment? It's happened before. Every time the 
South experiences a deep freeze, the price of fruits and vegetables soars out 
of reach. 
</P>
<P>
To the veggie freaks whose idea of pigging out is to graze on the front lawn, 
these are indeed dark days. For me, it's an omen. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago I said, "God, if you want me to get off this crummy diet, give me 
a sign." The very next day in the supermarket I picked up a single tomato. It 
was marked $3. At that very moment, I heard organ music. The tomato was 
returned and I hit the Dove bars. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take much to dissuade me from buying and eating greens. Not only am 
I not a vegetable disciple, I have never been convinced that vegetables make 
you thin. The first time my mom took me to the zoo, I watched as the keeper 
threw a bucket of greens to an orangutan. I wasn't the brightest kid on the 
block, but I figured here was an animal that exercised regularly, ate healthy 
and got a lot of sleep, and look how he turned out. He had a waistline the size 
of a Disney parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
That sorta set the pace for me. I'm possibly the only person who can visit a 
salad bar and run up a calorie tab of 1,200 on one plate. I start with a bed of 
croutons and drown them in a sea of blue cheese with bacon bits, then garnish 
it with two cherry tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
As is generally the case, carbohydrate eaters are attracted to mates who thrive 
on proteins. I came from a family where gravy was a beverage and ketchup was a 
vegetable. My husband's family bought lettuce by the field. 
</P>
<P>
After we married, it wasn't easy trying to blend our eating habits. I thought a 
long time before I made a decision to bring a child into a world polluted by 
Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
When my husband looked into the refrigerator last week, he said, "Where's the 
vegetables?" 
</P>
<P>
I handed him an artichoke with the price on it and he gasped. "Let me guess. 
You bought a designer artichoke? I thought I told you to get eggplant." 
</P>
<P>
"If you want me to buy eggplant," I said, "I'll arrange financing, but the way 
I look at it, we are being given a sign that the world is coming to an end as 
we know it." 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of nonsense is that?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"All the foods that experts say are good for you are dwindling -- fresh fish, 
vegetables, fruits." 
</P>
<P>
"The shortage can be explained," he said. "The weather is an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I've been telling you," I said. "Hear the organ?"

Farewell -- thou art too dear for my possessing, 
</P>
<P>
 And like enough thou know'st thy estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- William Shakespeare, Sonnet 87 
</P>
<P>
This was no ordinary lecture on The Bard. Sure, it took place at Pomona 
College. And yes, some students did take notes. But the whimsical nature of the 
talk was evident from the first, when English professor Martha Andresen strode 
up to the podium and said: 
</P>
<P>
"We hear in Shakespeare's Sonnet 87 his mastery of the 'drop-dead-you-creep' 
poetic style." 
</P>
<P>
She then launched into an often funny and always pointed analysis of how the 
themes of usury, money and love intertwined in the writings of William 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
It was part of a weekly lecture series called "Filthy Lucre," in which 
professors from various disciplines look at humanity's lust for money through 
the ages. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's talk, on the eve of Valentine's Day, just happened to focus on the 
juxtaposition of money and love. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the topic so salient today? 
</P>
<P>
"Greed . . . and the 'filthy lucre' approach to life is in the air," says Anne 
Bages, the Pomona College professor who chairs the Tuesday luncheon series that 
started in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to encourage faculty members as well as students to view an 
individual topic through many different lenses. In the 1990 series, that topic 
happens to be the filthy lucre, or riches, first described in the New Testament 
of the Bible by the Apostle Paul in letters to his disciple Timothy. 
</P>
<P>
A Feb. 27 discussion by Alma Zook, an associate professor of physics, will 
discuss filthy lucre in terms of the cold fusion controversy and recently 
purported attempts by scientists to falsify data in the pursuit of fame and 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
On March 20, Paul Hurley, an assistant professor of philosophy, will tackle 
junk bonds when he discusses "The CEO as Strongman: The Fiction of Managerial 
Accountability." 
</P>
<P>
Bages says timely resonance was added to the series by Wednesday's announcement 
that the parent firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the once mighty ruler of the 
junk bond market, had sought protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-core devotees, who include students and faculty members from some of the 
adjoining Claremont colleges, say the series allows them to delve into issues 
for which they might not have a forum in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Andresen says she might spend two weeks going over Shakespeare's 
"The Merchant of Venice," but that she probably wouldn't devote a whole lecture 
to usury. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a way to move from an academic discipline to address a larger moral 
and social problem," Andresen says. We don't want to be isolated in an ivory 
tower and these public lectures are an opportunity to reach out and apply what 
we know." 
</P>
<P>
And it is not always achieved in an orthodox fashion. Most people would look at 
usury through an economic, historical or maybe even a moral context, Bages 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"Putting it in a poetic framework makes it more appealing," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Scott Warren, associate dean of students and assistant professor of 
government, will discuss "Marx, Money, Marriage." The series continues each 
Tuesday at noon through March 27, when the final topic will be "The 
Institutionalization of Greed: East vs. West" by David Arase, assistant 
professor of government.

COUNCIL REFUSAL TO GIVE LAWSUIT COSTS ASSAILED

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council last week enraged some community leaders by refusing to help 
one of its commissions gather information on money the city has paid out in 
police court cases. 
</P>
<P>
The council refused a request by the Public Safety Advisory Commission to 
compile a list of settlements and judgments, along with itemized attorney fees, 
spent on defending police-related lawsuits during the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of council members voted down the request Tuesday, arguing that they 
don't want to burden city staff with the task of compiling the data. The 
information, the council argued, already is public record and commission 
members can dig it up themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners, who are volunteers appointed by the council, said that is 
not their role. City staff, commissioners insisted, have an obligation to 
assist the commission in reviewing safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
The council, on the advice of the city's attorneys, makes all final decisions 
on what cases to settle out of court and for what amounts. Some council members 
said the commission is challenging their authority and attempting to 
"second-guess" their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Clark disagreed with his colleagues: "I don't think this is an 
unreasonable request." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who plans to raise the issue again at Tuesday's council meeting, 
predicted that to deny the request would only raise more questions. "It will 
appear as though we don't want it to come out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that is exactly how many community leaders viewed the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"What are they trying to hide?" asked commission member Larry Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's atrocious," said Alan Lowenthal, president of the Long Beach Area 
Citizens Involved. 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Bud Huber said he is "perturbed beyond words," and filed a 
letter with the city clerk Wednesday requesting the same information sought by 
the commission. Huber, president of the Belmont Shore Improvement Assn., said 
he was making the request for himself and not for the association. He called 
the council's vote, "the supreme insult to the constituents." 
</P>
<P>
School board member Jerry Shultz said: "If it's really public, they should make 
it readily available." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Berry, president of the local chapter of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said he supports the commission's inquiry 
"wholeheartedly." He said: "It is inappropriate for council members or staff 
members to keep the public in the dark on something that their tax dollars are 
used for." NAACP officials have expressed concern over the years about 
allegations of racism and brutality involving Long Beach police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Council members contend that they are keeping no one in the dark because, in 
the words of Councilwoman Jan Hall, "public information is public information." 
</P>
<P>
Hall and other council members suggested that commission members are welcome to 
research the information themselves. City Atty. John Calhoun, who already 
provided the commission with overall dollar figures, said it could take his 
office four months to compile the data on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
But commission members, who make recommendations to the council on safety and 
police matters, said it is not their job to do such research. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't know what to look for. I wouldn't know what to ask for, nor do I 
have the time," commission member Barbara Shoag said after addressing the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Shoag told the council that the Public Safety Advisory Commission would like a 
breakdown of the money paid out in settlements and judgments for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing such data would help the commission spot patterns that could lead to 
recommendations about policy or procedure changes within the Police Department, 
Shoag said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she noted that the city's recent settlement of a brutality case 
"has caused many citizens throughout the city to question the amount of 
taxpayer dollars" paid in settlements and judgments. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the council was criticized for how it settled a $330,000 brutality 
lawsuit against four police officers, the largest brutality settlement ever 
made by the city. City officials did not handle the settlement by placing the 
issue on a city agenda as usual. Critics complained that the council was trying 
to hide the settlement, an accusation council members denied. Nonetheless, two 
months ago the council agreed to note publicly any final settlement approved in 
closed session. 
</P>
<P>
Shoag said that the commission is not interested in reviewing that or any other 
settlement for the purpose of criticizing the council's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"We make this request on behalf of the general citizenry. . . . After all, this 
is all taxpayer money and the public has a right to be informed," Shoag told 
the council. "Let me make it clear that we have no interest or desire to 
question or challenge any of the past settlements. We know those decisions were 
made using yours or the city manager's best judgment and negotiating skills." 
</P>
<P>
But the request was perceived by the council majority as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some question that you may be over-exceeding what you have been chaired 
to provide for the City Council and for the mayor's office," Mayor Ernie Kell 
told Shoag. 
</P>
<P>
"You are getting into an area which is best left to the members of the City 
Council, who get full briefings," Kell said. 
</P>
<P>
Most council members, the city attorney and Assistant City Atty. Bob Shannon 
argued that the information the commissioners are requesting will leave out the 
"why" of the settlement, and that, they continued, renders the raw data 
confusing, if not meaningless. For example, a case may have been settled not 
because an officer did something wrong, but because it would cost more money to 
continue with the case than to simply settle it out of court, officials 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"A little information always brings about speculation," Councilman Jeff Kellogg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Hall also saw the commission's request as a potential review of 
council decisions: "To go back and second-guess every single decision the city 
has made, I see as having no purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners insist that is not their intent. Even if it were, argued 
Lowenthal of Long Beach Area Citizens Involved, the public "has the right to 
second-guess them." 
</P>
<P>
"And the idea that, 'You are going to get confused' -- confused about 
what?"Lowenthal asked. "It's a policy that distrusts the public." 
</P>
<P>
The council members who voted against the commission's request are Hall, 
Kellogg, Wallace Edgerton, Les Robbins and Clarence Smith. Councilmen Evan 
Anderson Braude and Ray Grabinski were absent for the vote, although Grabinski 
was present during most of the discussion and he indicated that he would not 
support the commission. Clark voted for it and Councilman Warren Harwood said 
he voted with Clark by mistake. Harwood spoke against the commission's request 
consistently throughout the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the Public Safety Advisory Commission has hit a snag 
with the City Council, as Councilman Grabinski noted during Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time this issue came up we almost had a vote on this commission, and 
you recall that," Grabinski told Shoag. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1987, the council questioned whether the commission had 
overstepped its powers in suggesting the creation of a police civilian review 
board. At the time, a majority of the council vehemently opposed such a review 
board, and one councilman even questioned whether the council should abolish 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Shoag told Grabinski: "The last thing we want to do is jeopardize the 
commission's existence." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Ernest McBride, a longtime community activist, was incensed that 
the council was threatened or "embarrassed" by his group's request. "I resent 
the way this council has twice insulted us," McBride told his colleagues during 
their monthly meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
McBride was not the only one who made a reference to the squabble with the 
council in 1987, when members also questioned whether the commission was going 
beyond its authority. As he was walking away from their meeting Wednesday, 
Commissioner Allan Tebbetts quipped: "We failed the attitude test again."

USC SELLING PACIFIC PALISADES MANSION FOR USE AS U.S.-EUROPE RESEARCH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacific Palisades mansion that was a gathering place for intellectuals who 
fled Hitler's Germany is being bought by a West German foundation for use as a 
research center for European-American relations and German exile literature. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by USC, which inherited the house in 1987, to sell it for $1.9 
million is a victory for the German foundation and for preservationists who two 
years ago opposed a plan by the university to sell the property and move its 
prized 36,000-volume library to the university's Exposition Park campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans -- with the support of West German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and former Chancellor Willy Brandt -- wanted to keep the house and 
library intact as a monument to German writers and artists who fled Nazi 
persecution and settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in December, USC will allow approximately 22,000 
volumes to be kept at the mansion on a long-term loan. The remaining books -- 
all rare first editions or volumes printed before AD 1500 -- will be kept in a 
temporary storage facility near the campus until they can be moved into a 
permanent wing to be built in Doheny Memorial Library in the next several 
years, said George Abdo, USC executive assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style house, featuring a sweeping view of the Pacific from a bluff 
above Sunset Boulevard, was bought by the late German novelist and playwright 
Lion Feuchtwanger in 1943 and served as a hub for the German exile community in 
Los Angeles and other European notables. Among its regular visitors were Thomas 
Mann, Charlie Chaplin, Bertolt Brecht, Aldous Huxley, Arnold Schoenberg and 
conductor Bruno Walter. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, the Villa Aurora was a productive and important meeting place during 
the exile period," said Lothar C. Poll, spokesman for the group that is buying 
the house and publisher of the West Berlin Tagesspiegel, the city's main daily 
newspaper. "It was a kind of 'Weimar on the Pacific.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least twice a year, members of the exile community would gather at the house 
to hear Feuchtwanger read from manuscripts of his latest plays or novels, 
according to USC professor Harold von Hofe, senior fellow of the new research 
center, called the Villa Aurora Institute. After discussions, the group would 
adjourn downstairs for herring salad followed by apple strudel, recalled Hilde 
Waldo, Feuchtwanger's personal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in 1927 by the Los Angeles Times as a showcase of the 
latest in home design. 
</P>
<P>
Feuchtwanger's widow, Marta, left the mansion and library to USC upon her death 
in 1987, but her will gave the university the option of selling the house and 
using the proceeds to build a Lion Feuchtwanger Memorial Library on campus. The 
house's library would have been moved to the new library on campus, in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying the house, the German foundation, called the Circle of 
Friends and Supporters of the Villa Aurora, has agreed to pay an estimated $2 
million to upgrade the house's interior and shore up its crumbling foundation. 
The group also will be responsible for raising funds to run the Villa Aurora 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the West German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the 
West Berlin senate, as well as private donors, contributed funds to the 
preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the institute have yet to be worked out, but university officials 
said the main focus will be European-American relations, a topic they say will 
become increasingly critical as political events in Europe continue to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Among speakers already lined up for institute-sponsored lectures in the summer 
and fall are Brandt and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, said Daniel M. Evans, 
attorney for the Friends of Villa Aurora, the California counterpart of the 
German group. The lectures will probably be given at USC or at other facilities 
that can hold large audiences, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The house will also serve as a center for research into German exile 
literature, including studies of works by Feuchtwanger, Mann, Alfred Doeblin 
and other German writers who produced many of their best-known works in Los 
Angeles. The exile studies center will be closely tied to the existing 
Feuchtwanger Institute for Exile Studies on the USC campus, said Von Hofe, who 
also heads the campus institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the research center will necessarily operate on a small scale -- 
the house does not comfortably hold more than about 50 people, he said, and 
parking on the narrow and winding road that leads up to it is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, plans for the institute must first be presented to neighbors at a 
public hearing chaired by a city zoning administrator, who will decide whether 
to recommend a conditional use permit for the center, said Claire Rogger, 
deputy to City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement caps two years of long-distance negotiations between USC and the 
German foundation. USC initially rejected the Germans' preservation proposal, 
but several weeks later said it would reconsider it, if the group came up with 
$15 million to pay for the new Feuchtwanger library on campus, repair the house 
and establish an endowment to run a research center at the mansion, which the 
university would continue to own. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans said they would agree to such a plan only if half the money could 
be raised from American donors, a proposal that ultimately fell through because 
the U.S. fund-raising effort failed, Von Hofe said. However, the Germans' 
fund-raising campaign was more successful, and USC changed its position and 
agreed to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
Final terms of the agreement were worked out last fall, Von Hofe said, and a 
board of trustees of the Villa Aurora Institute will be chosen soon after 
escrow closes in the next few months. Von Hofe said the institute's acting 
director will be Daniel S. Hamilton, who recently joined the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace as a senior associate after seven years as deputy 
director of the Aspen Institute Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an evolutionary process, and in the end it simply proved that this 
was the most effective way to resolve the situation and accomplish the ends 
that they and we wished to accomplish," Abdo said. "We are obviously pleased 
and supportive. We think it provides the grounds for the development of the 
Feuchtwanger Library on the campus and for the development of an important 
institute for exile studies and Euro-American studies in Los Angeles."

ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME DREAMS FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Valentine's Day approached, John Alexander was busier than a one-armed 
chocolate dipper. 
</P>
<P>
He had helicopters to dispatch, champagne to order, red carpets to roll out. 
</P>
<P>
Founder and head of Alexander &amp; Associates/Dreams Come True, the 
35-year-old West Hollywood resident is in the wish-fulfillment business. He 
packages first-cabin dreams for private clients and for corporations that want 
to reward valued employees with something more memorable than a gold watch. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander's company, whose offices are in Los Feliz, executes romantic, 
exciting and "wonderful things to make wonderful impressions." On the eve of 
Valentine's Day and again on the holiday itself, he had arranged for elegant 
evenings on the town for two different clients who planned to propose with a 
flourish to unsuspecting girlfriends during helicopter rides over the 
glimmering city. It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment the couples could tell 
their grandchildren about -- and the sort of thing Alexander does all the time. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander has 35 prearranged offerings that run the gamut from making pizza at 
Spago with Wolfgang Puck for $1,995 to blowing up a building (he arranges 
customized experiences as well). "These are not stock, boring, horrible 
things," Alexander assured. He said he and his staff personalize each event so 
"this is a dream come true, not a Greyhound tour." Because most of the details 
have already been worked out, prearranged events are relatively inexpensive and 
can be scheduled on a moment's notice, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a client can blow up a building for $7,495 and up. The client 
spends a weekend as part of a high-rise demolition team. On Saturday the client 
helps plant the dynamite that will cause a condemned building to implode, 
Alexander said. "And on Sunday you're the person who pushes the plunger while 
it is captured on videotape." The cost includes hotel and souvenir videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Because Alexander doesn't think dreams should be interrupted by such mundane 
concerns as the location of the nearest automatic teller machine, his fees 
include all costs, including tips. "The whole idea is that when someone is 
doing something, they don't have to pull a penny out of their pocket. They only 
have one job. That job is to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander describes his typical client as someone "who thinks life is no dress 
rehearsal. People love to play, especially in L.A. and especially on the 
Westside." He won't say how many of each prearranged package he sells each 
year. Predictably, the biggest sellers are the less expensive experiences such 
as gourmet breakfast in bed ($195 a couple) and VIP treatment at the restaurant 
of the client's choice. The latter, which costs $95 per person, includes 
schmoozing with the chef, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive prearranged option is flying in a fighter jet a la "Top 
Gun." People who have paid $10,000 to have that particular dream come true 
include a physician whom Alexander dubbed Top Doc. Other four-figure items 
include piloting a 747 via a state-of-the-art jet simulator ($1,345) and 
throwing a dinner party on a private jet ($3,500 and up). 
</P>
<P>
Customized experiences start at $1,000. Alexander said the firm will consider 
almost any request that isn't illegal or immoral, or doesn't require an act of 
God. The company does not arrange for meetings with celebrities, however, and 
it doesn't get people dates. In describing his profession, Alexander never, 
never describes himself as a fantasy merchant. The staff refers to fantasy "as 
the 'f' word" because its sexual connotations invariably elicit bizarre 
requests. When Playboy magazine mentioned the firm, he said, "people wrote 
letters and signed their names to requests you wouldn't believe." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander has arranged for private clients to ride in submarines, play in a 
jazz band, be a zookeeper for a day and go to the Academy Awards presentation 
and the Governor's Ball afterward. The experience for the twin brothers who 
wanted to play in a jazz band included posters with their pictures on them. "If 
we can't make it unique," Alexander said, "it's just another party. We all go 
to fabulous parties, but we don't go to many dreams come true." 
</P>
<P>
One staple feature of the experiences is luxury transportation. The firm 
sometimes uses a bus with a teak and leather interior and a full bath, 
including tub. The company also uses limousines that "are not long taxis," 
Alexander said. "The chauffeur is a professional, not a starving actor." If a 
client dribbles caviar on his tie en route, the driver can supply him with 
another one. Pantyhose are also on board, as are condoms. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the company's rent-a-dreams involve fast cars, yachts and 
planes, Alexander eschews gliders and hot-air balloons. "We have never found a 
provider we could be proud of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander has been able to fulfill a number of his own wishes in the course of 
doing test runs of new experiences. For instance, he has brought down a 
building. But he still has two dreams that have yet to come true: riding in a 
private jet and taking the Concorde. 
</P>
<P>
When Alexander, who formerly marketed medical products, started the business in 
1984, most of his clients were individuals. Now, he said, most are companies 
that use his offerings as incentives or rewards for employees. The firm's 
growing sensitivity to corporate culture is reflected in its addition of the 
businesslike Alexander &amp; Associates to the front of its name. 
</P>
<P>
In pitching his services to Pacific Bell, MCA-Universal and other corporate 
clients, Alexander argues that a personalized dream experience is a better 
carrot or motivator than a mass-produced microwave oven or even cash. The right 
employee will be blown away by the chance to blow up a building, he says. "The 
best way to motivate someone is to give them what they want. They, in turn, 
will want to give more." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents are good customers, he said. They give his preplanned 
offerings as housewarming gifts to their clients, hoping the new homeowners 
will mention to their friends the clever gift and the agent who gave it. A 
helicopter ride over the new house for picture-taking is popular, as is a 
gourmet house-cleaning-cum-bouquet. Agents who sell estates usually opt for 
bigger-ticket items, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate clients also ask for customized experiences. One cabinetmaking firm 
honored a retiring employee who was fascinated by Howard Hughes' wooden 
behemoth, the Spruce Goose, with a VIP tour of the plane conducted by one of 
the men who helped build it. 
</P>
<P>
"The company wanted to say how much they appreciated him," Alexander said. 
"They wanted to give him a reward he would remember for the rest of his life. I 
think he's still surprised."

PLANNED MALIBU GOLF COURSE IS NOW IN DOUBT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: FINANCIAL PROBLEMS MAY FORCE GROUP TO CHANGE PLANS AND BUILD HOMES 
ON 270 ACRES IN ENCINAL CANYON. ANOTHER PROPOSED COURSE IN CORRAL CANYON IS HIT 
BY THREE LAWSUITS. 
</P>

<P>
A financially troubled developer is said to have abandoned a controversial plan 
to develop an 18-hole golf course on 270 acres in Malibu's scenic Encinal 
Canyon, and may instead attempt to build up to 69 expensive homes there. 
</P>
<P>
"Every indication we have is that they plan to forget about the golf course," 
said Paul Russell, a spokesman for a homeowner group long opposed to the plan. 
The golf course was proposed as a joint venture by VMS Realty Partners of 
Chicago, and the Anden Group, a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Although the developer has not announced a change in its plans for the 
property, Russell said company officials "have all but said" in recent meetings 
with members of the West Malibu Community Council that they intend to drop the 
golf course idea. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, trouble also mounted for another proposed Malibu golf course when 
three lawsuits -- including one by Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp -- were filed 
last week in Los Angeles Superior Court in a bid to block the project planned 
for Corral Canyon. Neighbors and environmentalists say it would ruin the 
canyon. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla-based Sun Pacific Inc. wants to convert 340 acres of Corral Canyon 
into a private resort and residential area boasting an 18-hole golf course, a 
52,000-square-foot clubhouse, 60 homes, six tennis courts, two restaurants and 
a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Malibu Country Club proposal there was approved by county 
supervisors by a 4-to-1 vote in December, with Supervisor Ed Edelman 
dissenting. 
</P>
<P>
In his lawsuit, the attorney general asked a judge to overturn the approval on 
grounds that county planners and the supervisors failed to adequately analyze 
the environmental effects of the proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit by the Sierra Club and the Corral Canyon Homeowners Assn., and 
another lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council, made similar 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Lipson, vice president of strategic planning and project development at 
VMS, declined comment through a spokesman concerning the company's plans for 
the golf course in Encinal Canyon. Doug Ring, the firm's Los Angeles attorney, 
did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the Regional Planning Commission voted to recommend against the golf 
course proposal. The recommendation came the same week that the Local Agency 
Formation Commission approved a request by VMS/Anden to remove the property 
from the Malibu's proposed city limit. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowner groups have argued that the moving of more than 4 million cubic yards 
of dirt, which the company said would be necessary to develop the golf course, 
would be an environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the matter was to have come before the County Board of Supervisors. 
But, with the agreement of VMS/Anden officials, it was postponed until April. 
</P>
<P>
VMS is the sponsor of eight publicly traded real estate funds and about 100 
privately placed limited partnerships. It has about 110,000 investors and 
controls real estate assets valued at about $9 billion. Beset by severe 
liquidity problems and facing major lawsuits from investors, the company 
announced last week that it was suspending payments to lenders and to its 
publicly traded funds. 
</P>
<P>
Although relieved that VMS/Anden may no longer pursue the golf course, 
homeowners have taken a dim view of the plan to build the homes there. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not opposed to home-building per se, but they're talking about moving 2 
million cubic yards of dirt just to do that, and that's far more than what is 
necessary," Russell said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, environmentalists and neighbors have argued that the Corral Canyon 
project would destroy wildlife and vegetation, as well as worsen traffic 
congestion along Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
They are especially upset by plans to move 5 million cubic yards of dirt on the 
property and fill in an entire canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is that to take a pristine canyon, cut off slopes and hills and 
fill it in order to build expensive houses would be a big mistake," said Mary 
Nichols, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Angel, president of the homeowners group, said that "the amount of 
grading they're talking about is equal to a 250-story building that covers the 
entire surface of a football field." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that's what the area land-use plan means when it specifies 
minimizing land form alteration," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The $35-million development on land owned by entertainer Bob Hope still would 
need the approval of the state Coastal Commission, which is expected to 
consider the matter in the spring. In giving their approval, the supervisors 
sided with the Regional Planning Commission, which approved the project by a 
3-to-2 vote last August.

SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS TO BE GIVEN BACKGROUND CHECKS BEFORE RECEIVING LICENSES 
</P>

<P>
The California Highway Patrol, prompted by mounting concern over the safety of 
children who ride to school on buses, announced last week that the agency will 
tighten the application process for school bus drivers to obtain licenses. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Rengstorff, chief of enforcement for the CHP, told the Assembly 
Transportation Committee Thursday that beginning June 1, 180-day temporary 
licenses will no longer be issued to drivers employed by school districts and 
private school bus companies. 
</P>
<P>
Under the CHP plan, developed during the past few weeks, applicants for permits 
to drive school buses will be licensed only after fingerprint and background 
checks are completed. Currently, drivers who pass state tests are given 
temporary six-month permits to allow them to drive while the checks are being 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Rengstorff said authorities are targeting school bus drivers because "there 
just seems to have been numerous instances where contractor-employed applicants 
have been involved in serious bus incidents." 
</P>
<P>
In recent incidents two bus drivers employed by Laidlaw Transit, the nation's 
largest private school bus contractor, have been arrested on suspicion of 
driving school buses while drunk. A third Laidlaw driver was arrested for 
carrying a loaded gun in his bus. Laidlaw serves the Long Beach Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), said he called 
the hearing to examine the procedures used by Laidlaw, other bus companies, 
school districts and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something seriously out of whack" in the system, Katz said. He cited 
the recently discovered criminal backgrounds of some school bus drivers, 
allegedly faulty procedures of state authorities in licensing drivers and the 
poor accident record of private school bus operators. 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw officials defended their practices, saying the company has instituted a 
comprehensive driver safety program. 
</P>
<P>
But Katz said that based on CHP figures the accident rate for all private 
school bus contractors is significantly higher than the rate for drivers 
employed directly by school districts. The Los Angeles school district employs 
1,300 drivers, and the remaining 1,500 who transport the district's students 
work for private firms, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A specific breakdown of the accident rate for Los Angeles schools was not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1987-88 school year figures for the entire state released by 
Katz's office, drivers employed directly by school districts were involved in 
nearly seven accidents per million miles compared to almost 11 accidents per 
million miles for private bus companies. A spokesman for Katz said those 
figures -- the most recent available -- were for buses that carry 20 passengers 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
Spike Helmick, deputy CHP commissioner, confirmed the disparity, suggesting 
that one reason is that drivers for school districts tend to keep their jobs 
longer than do drivers for private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about school bus drivers have risen in recent months, following the 
arrests of two Laidlaw Transit employees accused of driving buses while drunk 
-- one in the San Fernando Valley and the other in San Diego. Laidlaw is paid 
about $20 million a year by the Los Angeles Unified School District and is its 
largest bus contractor, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In January, a Laidlaw driver, Harold Keith Lone, was arrested in Encino as he 
prepared to pick up students at Lanai Elementary School. A breath test showed 
Lone had a blood-alcohol level of 0.27%, more than three times the legal limit 
of 0.08%. Authorities have said that Lone obtained his job by using an alias to 
hide a lengthy criminal record, including five drunk driving convictions. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a school bus driver transporting Clairemont High School 
students in San Diego was charged with drunk driving after his bus rear-ended a 
pickup truck, injuring three people, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Katz said he was also concerned about another San Diego case in which 
Laidlaw driver Victor H. Gomez in 1987 allegedly kidnaped a 5-year-old girl 
from a school bus and molested her. A civil lawsuit filed by the child against 
Laidlaw is pending. San Diego police said Gomez remains a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's hearing, Katz expressed shock that Gomez still has a valid 
license to drive a school bus. Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the Department of 
Motor Vehicles, confirmed that his agency "had not suspended or revoked" 
Gomez's license because "we had no information from law enforcement or other 
sources that would allow us to act." 
</P>
<P>
Katz complained about the DMV's "business-as-usual approach" in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that Laidlaw and other private bus contractors "are not 
acknowledging their responsibility to develop a better procedure of screening 
the drivers." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Daley, vice president of operations for Laidlaw Transit's Van Nuys-based 
operation, acknowledged that when he joined the office "substantial 
improvements were needed." 
</P>
<P>
Laidlaw has improved its checking of applicant references and training since 
Katz's committee had a similar hearing in 1988, Daley said. "We feel our 
procedures have been corrected in a responsive manner," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Daley described the latest arrests of drivers as "isolated" but said they 
pointed up the need to improve staff training to detect drug and alcohol abuse 
among drivers. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to discourage problems, Laidlaw officials asked the committee to 
adopt criminal sanctions against drivers who lie about their background on 
employment applications, including a mandatory six-month jail term and a 
$10,000 fine for violations.

The women's division of the San Gabriel Chamber of Commerce last week presented 
to the city 15 "Welcome to San Gabriel" signs. 
</P>
<P>
During ceremonies Tuesday, the first sign was installed near the San Marino 
border at North Mission and Domingo drives. 
</P>

3 SUE CLUB IN HOLLYWOOD FOR SEX BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: SUIT SAYS FLORENTINE GARDENS DENIED TWO MEN AND A WOMAN ADMISSION 
ON 'MINISKIRT NIGHT.' THE CLUB IS ALSO TARGET OF RACIAL BIAS CLAIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Hollywood dance club already under fire for allegedly discriminating against 
minorities was hit with a sex-discrimination lawsuit last week by two men and a 
woman who said they were unfairly denied admission because they were not 
wearing miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Exler of Palm Springs, Dennis Koire of Anaheim and Julie Palasco of Los 
Angeles said their civil rights were violated Dec. 10 when they were allegedly 
denied free entrance into the Florentine Gardens nightclub on "miniskirt 
night." 
</P>
<P>
The three are seeking $1 million in punitive damages and no less than $250 in 
actual damages for "humiliation and degradation." They also seek a preliminary 
injunction that would bar the club from forcing men to pay the regular $10 
cover charge while letting women wearing miniskirts in for free, according to 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The law is very clear in this area, that you cannot discriminate on the basis 
of sex," said Exler, 28, a paralegal who in the past has filed a number of 
discrimination lawsuits alone or with Koire. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Palasco was subjected to "arbitrary and capricious" 
discrimination when employees of the popular Hollywood Boulevard club refused 
to let her in free because she was wearing pants. 
</P>
<P>
Florentine Gardens already is target of racial discrimination charges by black, 
Asian and Latino college students, who allege that security personnel have 
denied them admission on Thursday "University Nights" by selectively applying 
an unspecified dress code. 
</P>
<P>
The students -- from USC, UCLA, Occidental and other area colleges -- have 
staged several protests at the club to draw attention to what they said were 
informal racial admission quotas and have enlisted the aid of the American 
Civil Liberties Union and university administrators to get the club to change 
its policies. 
</P>
<P>
David M. Brown, a lawyer for the nightclub, said discussions are under way 
among minority students, the ACLU and Florentine Gardens over questions of 
alleged racial discrimination. He maintained that the club is frequented by 
young people of all races "and practices no form of discrimination whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
The new lawsuit, however, will be taken less seriously, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our response is this that when we stop laughing, we'll respond," Brown said. 
"I suppose this means we couldn't have a green hat day either." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said a 1985 state Supreme Court ruling that held that sex-based 
promotions, such as "ladies' nights," are unconstitutional does not apply in 
this case. The club does not grant free admission only to women on "miniskirt 
nights" but rather to anyone wearing a miniskirt, including men, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also described Exler, who in 1984 made national headlines by winning a 
suit against Disneyland for refusing to allow him to dance with another man at 
the park, as "a professional litigant." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs contend that ads announcing the night at the club specifically 
say only women wearing miniskirts would get in free. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Exler and the other plaintiffs referred to the same 1985 state 
Supreme Court case as precedent that "miniskirt nights" are discriminatory and 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
That case was filed in 1979 by Koire, who sued 11 carwashes and seven 
nightclubs for having "ladies' day" specials. The state's high court found that 
price breaks based on sex are discriminatory and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider this to be a flagrant violation given the Supreme Court ruling," 
said lawyer John J. Duran. "Their policy of ladies being admitted free with 
miniskirts is not only discriminatory against men but a reinforcement of sexist 
stereotypes of women." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his Disneyland suit, Exler sued the Chippendales nightclub in 
Los Angeles in 1988 for allegedly barring him and two friends from entering the 
male strip show. Disputing Brown's contention that he was suing Florentine 
Gardens for publicity reasons, Exler insisted that he only files lawsuits when 
he has good reason to. 
</P>
<P>
"We fight when we're wronged," he said.

ARGUMENTS AGAINST COVERED RESERVOIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The resounding no at the Feb. 6 Westside hearing at Paul Revere Junior High 
School, on the Department of Water and Power's plan to cover the city's 10 
remaining open reservoirs, will most likely have little impact on the DWP's 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
They seem determined to spend the $500 million to $1 billion to hide the beauty 
of sparkling water "lakes" in our hills and canyons, even though two years ago 
a similar proposal was turned down for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The findings and tests did not prove that "bird droppings, animals drinking the 
water, sunlight and air pollutants" endanger our drinking water supply. 
</P>
<P>
What is most disturbing about this latest push to cover open reservoirs is the 
all-out public relations campaign to sell the program with ads and direct 
mailings. The unanswered question is how to make the DWP commission more 
responsive to the public's need. We all want health safeguards and better 
water. Covers for open reservoirs (are no substitute) for new water lines, 
greater cleansing at filter plants, more home filters and better disposal of 
waste.

BAKERY FINED $8,610, TOLD TO MAKE CAKES FOR NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hansen Cakes Inc. has been fined $8,610 and ordered to donate enough cakes to 
feed 2,400 needy youngsters after being convicted of health violations stemming 
from "filthy and unsanitary conditions" at its Fairfax area headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn, in announcing the penalties last week, also noted 
that the specialty cake baker has spent $11,000 to renovate the bakery, where 
it also makes cakes for its outlets in Beverly Hills and Tarzana. Hahn said 
owner Gary Hansen has cleared up all public health problems "and turned this 
bakery back into an asset to the community." 
</P>
<P>
The cake company, which for 40 years has been a principal caterer to Hollywood 
and the entertainment industry, was sentenced Feb. 13 by Los Angeles Municipal 
Court Commissioner Joseph Spada. Attorneys for the bakery had pleaded no 
contest to four Public Health Code charges. 
</P>
<P>
When filing charges against the bakery in December, Hahn said Hansen Cakes has 
had a history of problems over the past 10 years, including cockroach 
infestation, deficient housekeeping and occasional vermin infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said the penalties were extreme, and many of the problems identified by 
state health inspectors came during renovations, when the bakery was in 
disarray. "On some of the counts, I'm upset," Hansen said. "They did a number 
on us." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the penalty, the bakery must donate enough cakes to feed at least 
100 people each month at Para Los Ninos, a nonprofit organization assisting 
children in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles, and the MacLaren Children's 
Center, a county juvenile facility in El Monte. The value of the cakes must 
total $1,920 and ultimately feed 2,400 people, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Hansen, Spada also placed the company on three years summary 
probation and ordered it to pay $5,860 in fines and penalties and $2,750 in 
restitution to the state Department of Health Services to cover its 
investigative costs. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials say the bakery is one of the largest in the Los Angeles area, 
estimating its revenues at about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The bakery also was cited Dec. 27 by county Health Services inspectors, who 
reported finding "active cockroach infestation," and ventilation and 
cleanliness problems during a routine inspection.

Jan. 18, 1990) concerning the proposal to move UCLA's laboratory school to the 
Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education of the SMMUSD appears to be attracted to the proposal to 
affiliate UCLA's University Elementary School with SMMUSD because it will bring 
a prestigious university laboratory school into the Santa Monica district. 
</P>
<P>
They seem to ignore that virtually everyone who has had a role in making UES a 
prestigious school opposes the affiliation with the district. The teaching 
staff who develop the curriculum and the educational program have threatened to 
resign if the move takes place. The faculty of the Graduate School of 
Education, who establish the research agenda for the laboratory school and thus 
give it legitimacy in the university community, oppose the move and threaten to 
cancel research programs at the school if the move takes place. Educators 
nationally raise questions about the wisdom of risking the loss of a 
historically successful school by affiliating with a public school district. 
</P>
<P>
Who does this leave supporting the move? It leaves the UCLA administrators who 
covet the UES site for new, more profitable uses. And it leaves the dean of the 
Graduate School of Education whose most persuasive arguments in favor of moving 
UES have to do with finding other public sources to pay for its programs. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the SMMUSD Board of Education, and the constituents who elect them, 
question the motives of those at UCLA who support the proposal, and wonder 
about just who will be running this "prestigious" school once it has been 
dumped in their laps.

LAURA LAKE IS NOT A 'VOICE' FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a loyal resident of Westwood and an earnest reader of The Times and its 
Westside section, I find myself no longer able to stomach the seemingly 
relentless flow of infantile claims, interpretations and general political 
nonsense from Laura Lake and her Friends of Westwood Inc. Far too often this 
community has been misrepresented by this self-proclaimed "voice" of the 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, several of Lake's views and aspirations for Westwood do not 
reflect those of the bulk of its people. 
</P>
<P>
These "people" include established homeowners, renters and a diverse group of 
business operators as well. Virtually all are devoted to the socioeconomic 
prosperity of the Westwood area and, therefore, are concerned about the real 
elements and issues affecting its future. This practical stance has led many of 
us to the brink of nausea as we listen to Lake's latest petty crusade against 
the UCLA Medical Center's proposed Guest House. 
</P>
<P>
Lake is fond of using the term "credibility" in her efforts. Might I suggest 
that she take a moment to ponder her own. Perhaps she will come to the 
realization that her misdirection makes her, at best, an "acquaintance" of 
Westwood.

AFTER LOSING FAMILY, MAN TRIES TO FIND A PURPOSE IN HIS PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a warm December day, and Patrick Carr is taking a drive. 
</P>
<P>
First stop: the Glendale cemetery where his wife, Patricia, 36, and 6-year-old 
daughter, Caren, are buried. Two simple tombstones under a tree read, "Cute 
wife and mommy" and "The best daughter in the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
Last stop: the Glendale intersection where they were killed by a drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Carr drives toward the traffic island on which they had been standing, 
first at the speed limit -- 35 m.p.h. -- then at 40, now at 45. His hands grip 
the wheel, he leans forward in his seat and his aging Mercedes-Benz picks up 
speed as his blue eyes flash angrily. 
</P>
<P>
Only his voice, gentle and rambling, remains calm. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine going around this curve at 79.2 m.p.h.?" he asks, referring to 
the speed police say William Conway was traveling when he hit and killed the 
Carrs and two others on July 13, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There," he says, pointing to an area south of the traffic island. "That's 
where they landed. They were knocked out of their shoes. Their insides were 
just destroyed. Like a china plate being shattered." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Carr, 38, is trying to cope. 
</P>
<P>
He and William Cramer, 37, both lost a wife and daughter on that traffic island 
at Verdugo Road and Canada Boulevard. Valerie Cramer, 32, her daughter, 
Brianna, 9, and a son, Billy, 11, had been strolling with the Carrs that night. 
They were waiting on the island to cross the street. Only Billy, who was able 
to dive from the path of the speeding car, survived. 
</P>
<P>
Conway, a boyishly handsome 28-year-old, was convicted Feb. 7 on charges of 
manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol. Next month he will be 
sentenced by a judge to up to 18 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
William Cramer was reserved before and during the trial, sticking close to 
friends and family. After the verdict, he wept, grinned, laughed and told 
reporters he actually felt a little sorry for Conway. 
</P>
<P>
But Carr was different. He was a spokesman for the tragedy, answering any 
question posed. What certain technical testimony meant. What kind of shoes his 
daughter was wearing when she was killed. How he'll survive. 
</P>
<P>
On this warm day last December, several weeks before Conway will be convicted, 
Carr cannot predict the future. He knows only the past. And the past he grips 
tightly, like the steering wheel he holds with clenched hands. 
</P>
<P>
After a visit to the cemetery, Carr drives down Hermosita Drive, his family's 
old neighborhood. His front seat is loaded with photo albums, stocked with 
pictures of Patti, Caren and the house. 
</P>
<P>
He proudly shows a Woman's Day magazine article about Patti winning a home 
interior decorating contest. He himself had worked extensively on their home. 
</P>
<P>
Carr, an electrical contractor, and Patti, a clerk at her parents' balloon and 
party supply store, had been paying her parents for the house. Ten days after 
the accident, her parents asked Carr to move out. He moved into a small 
apartment in Montrose. 
</P>
<P>
"You're working and doing better, and you have a family with eight years of 
memories. Then boom," he says, barely glancing at the house as he drives by. 
"Now I just want to go home. But I can't. There's no home to go home to." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, after speeding past the intersection, Carr drives back to it and 
parks. He walks quickly to the island as if this time his hurrying will make a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
The night of the accident, Carr explains, he noticed Patti and Caren were late, 
so he drove around looking for them. He came upon the intersection, noticed all 
the police cars, got a bad feeling and stopped to investigate, he says. 
</P>
<P>
His recounting is quite detailed. He knows, from talking to people at the scene 
and from memory, exactly what the crowd was doing. He knows, from accident 
reports, talking to police and succumbing to his imagination, how the bodies 
flew and landed and looked. He remembers what the nurses, a pastor and others 
said at the hospital where Valerie Cramer had been taken while clinging briefly 
to her life. 
</P>
<P>
What he doesn't know is what happened to Patti and Caren after they died at the 
scene. This, perhaps, is what bothers him most. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a hard time believing in God after all this," he says. "I used to rub 
my wife's back when it got sore. Can you imagine how sore she is now? And 
Caren, Caren had her tonsils out three weeks before. I remember her in the 
hospital. She'd wake up and say, 'Daddy, my throat hurts.' Then I'd say, 'It's 
OK, honey.' " His voice gently trails off. "It's weird. They're dead, but you 
still care about them." 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks later, Carr is dressed in a suit and tie and standing in a 
Pasadena Superior Court hallway during a recess in Conway's trial. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year and a half, Carr has come here dozens of times, attending 
every court appearance Conway makes. Carr has not worked regularly for many 
weeks, he says, because going to court takes up the better part of his days. He 
has supported himself with money from savings and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The proceedings captivate him. One morning, Carr excitedly reviews the day's 
testimony with his sister, who is attending her first day of the trial. "What 
do you think?" he asks her. "Boring," says his sister, appearing slightly 
irritated. "I'm leaving." 
</P>
<P>
She does, but not before chiding her brother for talking so freely with 
reporters. He will hear that message from others before the trial is over. 
</P>
<P>
"For months after the accident happened, I talked about it at work," he says. 
"I talked about it to strangers. I talked my friends' ears off. People went 
crazy, and still do. But you know, my wife and daughter were killed, and I want 
something good to come out of this. I want it to stop people from getting in 
their cars after drinking. Maybe it can save one life." 
</P>
<P>
To improve the chances of meeting those goals, Carr almosts daily asks 
reporters how he can be more effective in print and on camera. He already has 
helped with a documentary on drunk driving that will be shown to school-age 
children. But he's depending on heavier coverage to get the message across. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 7, after the verdict is read, William Cramer leaves the courtroom with 
his son, Billy. He speaks happily to the swarm of microphones and cameras, hugs 
his son and laughs jubilantly. Next comes Patrick Carr, managing a faint smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I can put it to bed now and go on with my life," he tells reporters, his voice 
calm and gentle -- the usual. "I have to. I don't have a choice. I'll never be 
able to walk my daughter down the aisle. I'll never be able to let her go to 
the prom." 
</P>
<P>
Less than a week after the verdict, Patrick Carr has just worked a 19-hour day, 
his second day of work since the trial began. He has learned Conway's attorney 
plans to appeal the conviction and he is angry. For the first time in weeks, 
his voice sounds different. 
</P>
<P>
It is bitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I remembered why I quit working nights -- because I would start thinking 
about all this," he says. "I was glad for the guilty verdict, but it doesn't 
mean much because of the appeal, and because the sentencing is in the judge's 
hands. It seems a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Once again responding to questions, he talks at length about his family's old 
house, his former life, the trial, his reaction to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I shocked the hell out of people because of my delivery," he says. 
"I'm not morbid, though. It's like I wanted the world to know about my 
beautiful wife and daughter. I wanted to show they existed. And I wanted their 
deaths to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
He suddenly pauses, and it is his turn to ask a question. "Hey," he asks, his 
voice calm and gentle and . . . hopeful. "Do you think it worked?"

CONFUSED COUPLE WINS CLASH OVER BAFFLING 'BANNER' 
</P>

ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda and Chi-hwa Hong felt as though they had been plunged into "The Case of 
the Mysterious Banner." 
</P>
<P>
Warning notices arrived in the mail at their condominium. There were 
accusations and fines. 
</P>
<P>
After months of confusion, they finally found the solution to the mystery of 
why they were being fined: strips of red paper called chuen lien pasted around 
the door of a condominium unit they manage. 
</P>
<P>
What the Hongs, who moved from Taiwan to Alhambra five years ago, considered 
chuen lien, or Chinese good luck paper, the condominium board considered "a 
banner," strictly prohibited by the complex's bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, after months of controversy and the assessment of more than $200 
in fines, the matter was settled when the board agreed to revoke the fines and 
drop the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But the case highlights communication clashes and cultural misunderstandings 
that often confront immigrants and their neighbors in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Hongs, who help manage a friend's condo unit in a building at 1012 S. 
Marengo Ave., first were drawn into the controversy in January, 1989, when they 
received a notice from the building's property management company, warning, 
"Remove Banner from Building." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who still are trying to master the English language, said they were 
puzzled by the notice, accompanied by a demand that they pay a $25 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Hong, recalling something she had learned in English class, set out in 
search of a flag-type display. She found none. Then she speculated that one of 
the tenants, an 80-year-old Chinese man, may have hung a shirt on the balcony 
to dry, a common practice in Taiwan where few homes have clothes dryers. The 
Hongs warned the tenants not to leave anything out on the balcony, and they 
paid the fines. 
</P>
<P>
Those tenants moved out in August, 1989. In September, while the unit was still 
vacant, the Hongs received another violation notice. Perplexed, Linda Hong 
checked the word "banner" in an English-Chinese dictionary and asked her white 
colleagues what it meant. They told her it is like a flag, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked everywhere," Linda Hong said. "I even went up on the roof." 
</P>
<P>
But the Hongs said they found only chuen lien, which Chinese families 
traditionally hang on door frames at Chinese New Year. A chuen lien typically 
features auspicious wishes such as "God bless this family," and "May peace be 
with you." 
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese families leave them up for an entire year for fear that removing 
them would bring bad luck. The Hongs said the six-inch wide chuen lien strips 
seemed a natural part of the door frame. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have thought it was the chuen lien," Linda Hong said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, after realizing that the red paper strips were indeed the source of 
the complaint, the Hongs removed them. By then, however, they were locked in 
controversy with the condominium board and had retained a lawyer to help them 
fight the fines. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of their argument was that the warning about the "banner" was too 
vague. The building management company disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was adequately described to them what the problem was," said Crawford 
Moller, an owner of Moller Properties Inc., which manages the complex for the 
homeowners' group. But he acknowledged that staff members who spoke to the 
Hongs may not have had first-hand knowledge of what the offending "banner" was. 
</P>
<P>
Four members of the seven-member condo board were present Wednesday, including 
two of Chinese descent. The vote was 3-0, with board member Tony Provenzano 
abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a poor use of words," Provenzano said. But he said the Hongs should 
have come to the board for help sooner. "We revoked the fines because they are 
here, and we can see they actually did not understand." 
</P>
<P>
"We had different concepts of what a banner was," added Bette Herron, another 
board member. "That's part of the root of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Hongs' attempts to iron out the problem before Wednesday had been hampered 
by additional language difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we want to say something, but sometimes our English is limited," 
Linda Hong said. "We use English words, but it may be not the real meaning. 
When you're nervous, you can't express your thoughts thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was satisfied with the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This is America," she said. "You have to follow their rules." 
</P>
<P>
But she added: "We really didn't know what they were talking about."

HOT PROPERTY: HOPE SALE: THANKS FOR THE MEMORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BOB HOPE, who acquired huge property holdings during his long career as a 
comedian, and his wife, DOLORES, have sold a 195-acre ranch in Calabasas that 
they've owned since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
A Woodland Hills-based home builder, Continental Communities, bought the 
property in a $10-million deal that closed escrow about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Hope's attorney, Payson Wolfe, said that the ranch is probably the Hopes' last 
large West San Fernando Valley holding, "but he does have some properties 
elsewhere larger than this." 
</P>
<P>
The president of Continental Communities, Robert E. Zuckerman, said he plans to 
develop the site, on the northwest corner of Las Virgenes Road and the Ventura 
Freeway, with 75 homes priced at about $1.5 million each; a 40,000-square-foot 
office building, and a 250,000-square-foot shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
There is no home on the site. "Mr. Hope used it to run cattle, sheep and some 
horses," Zuckerman explained. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Hope had a reputation for buying and holding real estate. "But 
lately, he has been marketing a lot of his property," Zuckerman said. "I think 
that has to do with estate planning. He is 86, but (despite his age), the 
decisions rest with him, not his advisers. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out about this property through one of his associates, and we were 
very excited to get our check to Mr. Hope before anybody else. We paid exactly 
what he wanted, which is the way he likes to do business." 
</P>
<P>
Hope has some other properties that are for sale, Wolfe said, but the attorney 
would not elaborate. The comedian was unavailable for comment. He was busy last 
week rehearsing his NBC-TV special, scheduled to air this weekend, featuring 
"Phantom of the Opera" star Michael Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
Hope "loves to talk real estate," Wolfe said. But the comedian has been 
reticent about discussing his personal wealth. To a magazine article claiming 
he was worth $500 million, Hope once responded: 
</P>
<P>
"If I had half a billion dollars, I wouldn't go to Vietnam (for his TV specials 
during the war there); I'd send for it. Anyway, it's easy to save $500 million; 
you just save $1 million a year for 500 years." 
</P>
<P>
ZSA ZSA GABOR has purchased a 21-acre horse ranch just north of Moorpark and 
plans to retire there, according to her publicist. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to sell her Bel-Air home and settle down on her horse ranch to raise 
Tennessee walking horses," he said. "She'll either expand the house that's 
there or build a brand-new house. She wants a 6,000-square-foot rambling ranch 
home." 
</P>
<P>
Gabor was in Europe and couldn't be reached for comment, but she paid $1.75 
million for the ranch, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
DARIAN MATHIAS, an actress who recently appeared on ABC-TV's "Growing Pains," 
and Steven Bijan at Mike Glickman Realty's Woodland Hills office, co-listed the 
property, which had been owned by Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell McClure, owners of 
Courtesy Chevrolet in Thousand Oaks. Mathias once rode a horse through the 
office to promote the ranch to fellow agents. 
</P>
<P>
TOM SELLECK has put his Wilshire Boulevard bachelor pad on the market at 
$950,000. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the one-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath condo new in March, 1984, while starring 
in the "Magnum, P.I." TV series, filmed mostly in Hawaii. "He didn't want to 
camp out at his folks' house when he came home to visit in L.A.," a spokesman 
for Selleck explained. 
</P>
<P>
The actor reportedly decided to sell the 16th-floor, 1,828-square-foot unit -- 
with a wet bar, fireplace, den, built-in wine storage, spa in the master bath, 
knotty-pine double-door entry and used-brick covered balconies -- because he 
got married and became a father. 
</P>
<P>
After buying the unit, he married dancer Jillie Mack, and they became parents 
of a daughter, Hannah. A year ago last fall, the Sellecks purchased two houses 
in Southern California: one, which they are remodeling, on L.A.'s Westside; the 
other, where they spend most of their time, in Ventura County. The condo is 
listed with the Selleck Co. in Woodland Hills, a consulting and marketing firm 
headed by Bob Selleck, the actor's father.

<P>
LIBERACE'S Palm Springs house is being purchased, with escrow to close in a 
couple of months, at $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
After the pianist died there in February, 1987, the villa became the property 
of his Liberace Foundation, which gives music scholarships to colleges 
nationwide, mainly through funds raised at the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas. 
The foundation put the house on the market at $850,000 in November, 1988, after 
failing to get city approval to turn it into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Before Liberace bought the villa in 1967, it was a small hotel known as The 
Cloisters, though it was built as a mansion in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer, whose name is Stefan Hemming, has the right to negotiate separately 
for any of Liberace's belongings remaining in the house. Some were removed 
months ago and are on display in the Liberace Museum. Others may be auctioned 
later. 
</P>
<P>
Liberace owned four houses at various times in Palm Springs, and the one that 
is said to be his first has just been put on the market at $400,000, including 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The house also will be one of four on a March 4 home tour sponsored by the 
American Assn. of University Women. Tickets, at $10 each, may be obtained from 
the Palm Springs Historical Society or Palm Springs, Palm Desert or Rancho 
Mirage chambers of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The three-bedroom, three-bath, 2,800-square-foot house was built in the 
mid-'50s for actress Mae West, but Liberace bought it instead, adding a 
piano-shaped pool, indoor Japanese and Roman tubs, outside mirrors, a 
chandelier and a dining-room mural with caricatures of himself at the piano, 
flanked by Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Bob Hope and Debbie Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Desert residents Larry Seaward and his wife, Mary, bought the house last 
May as an investment. It had been used as a rental and was in need of work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of fun with it," Seaward said. "I'm just a retired guy who buys 
things and plays around with them, but I'm not that handy. I hired some 
painters and gardeners, and we had a contractor put on a new roof." The house 
is listed with Dale Erickson in the Palm Springs office of Great Western Real 
Estate.

IN THE GARDEN: PLANTING FROM SEED CAN YIELD SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Raising a plant from seed is just about the most adventuresome thing you can do 
in the garden, but fewer and fewer gardeners seem to be giving it a try 
according to seed catalogue companies, which report dwindling sales of seed, 
while sales of live plants are skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is easier to buy a plant at the nursery, and in some cases this is 
the better alternative because some plants come in special forms (called 
cultivars) that cannot be grown from seed but must be grown from cuttings. 
</P>
<P>
But, this is exactly what makes growing something from seed exciting. You are 
never 100% sure of the results, and you can grow all sorts of varieties that 
cannot be found at nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
Take the common cosmos for instance. Everyone has grown the large-flowered but 
plain-Jane lavender, pink or white forms found at nurseries. But there are also 
strains with smaller gold, orange and red flowers. And, there is a strain with 
petals that form hollow tubes, named Seashells. These are real showstoppers and 
fascinating cut flowers that will be the talk of the dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
There is a cosmos with contrasting red stripes against a white background, 
named Candy Stripe, and one named Psyche with almost double flowers. There is a 
cosmos named Radiance that has a darker center, and the Sensation strain -- the 
cosmos common at nurseries -- comes in separate colors so you could plant only 
white for instance. But, only if you grow your own from seed. That's the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I tried growing all of these for the adventure, ordering them from 
the seed catalogues of firms such as Burpee, Park and Thompson &amp; Morgan. 
Seed catalogues are arriving right now in the mail. (If you aren't on a mailing 
list, see the box listing catalogue sources.) 
</P>
<P>
This year's catalogues are full of similar delights, and now is the time to 
order seed. Seeds sprout best in Southern California in late summer (August or 
September) or in early spring (March and April). 
</P>
<P>
Early March is especially serendipitous since a late rain may help the seed 
sprout and the seedlings will be big enough to plant in the garden by 
mid-April, so they are thoroughly established by summer. 
</P>
<P>
Seed catalogues are traditionally thought of as good reading for the winter 
months back East, and they make pretty good reading for Californians as well, 
even if you just like looking at the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 Burpee Gardens catalogue for instance, is full of fascinating plants 
worth giving a try, from A to Z, achillea to zinnia. 
</P>
<P>
Last year I tried the new pastel and autumn-colored achilleas, or yarrows, and 
they now have a permanent home in our garden. The colors, especially those 
called mustard, bronze, beige and silver, are unlike any other flower, and won 
the strain named Summer Pastels a coveted All-American Selection medal. These 
yarrows are spreading perennials by the way, not annuals. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the alphabet is a new zinnia named Rose Pinwheel, with 
claimed mildew-resistance. Very good news for coastal gardeners if true, 
because mildew can finish off zinnias before their time. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, this is a cross between the common zinnia, Z. elegans and the 
wild Z. augustifolia. That second parent also makes this a short zinnia at 
about 12 inches tall. Another zinnia is an AAS winner this year: Scarlet 
Splendor has very bright red, ruffled blooms that reportedly grows to 5 inches 
across. 
</P>
<P>
In the vegetable department, a new picture-perfect radish with the delightful 
name Red Hot Sally sounds worth a try, and a few may be tempted to enter the 
$10,000 Prizewinner Pumpkin Contest. You have to grow a Burpee pumpkin named 
Prizewinner to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Park Seed Co. has plenty of intriguing plants too for 1990. A new vinca named 
Grape Cooler, should be tried by anyone living in the hot interior areas of 
Southern California, since it is perhaps the most heat resistant of summer 
annuals and this looks like a nice new form with bigger, rounder petals. 
</P>
<P>
Parks also has plenty of vegetables, including some of the best tomato 
varieties, and there is a section on dried flowers that is worth a look -- many 
are easy to grow in California. In this department, they offer a new plant with 
the funny name of Fibigia that is grown for exceptionally handsome gray-green 
seed pods that dry well. 
</P>
<P>
The Thompson &amp; Morgan catalogue used to have the most pictures, but it has 
been streamlined this year with fewer photos, though the photos are still the 
most tempting of the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Before you get two pages into the catalogue, there is a black carnation with 
white edges, a maroon pansy so dark it could be called black with yellow edges 
and a drop-dead, white-flowered, black-centered venidium, named Zulu Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Venidium are wildflowers from South Africa that grow exceptionally well in our 
similar climate, though they have not been generally available. Fall-planting 
is probably better than spring, however. 
</P>
<P>
It was while reading this catalogue that I decided to try all the cosmos and I 
notice that this year there is still another. Named Daydream, the flowers shade 
from pale to deep pink. If you can't find enough to read in this catalogue, 
Thompson &amp; Morgan also publishes an excellent quarterly journal, "Growing 
From Seed," filled with information on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson &amp; Morgan certainly has the most variety in its catalogue, but many 
of the plants are untried in California; this is an English company. But, then 
that is part of the adventure of growing things from seed, trying something new 
at very little cost. 
</P>
<P>
A packet of that black-centered venidium seed is only $3.85, which is 
admittedly high for seed, but this one is still brand-new and scarce. It is 
still less than a plant in a gallon can, and a packet of Seashells cosmos seed 
(100 seeds) is but $1.69. How can you pass that up?

MOVABLE FEATS; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE IT TAKES SOME PLANNING AND EFFORT, BUYING A 'MOVE-ON' IS A VIABLE ROUTE 
TO HOME OWNERSHIP FOR SOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A place to call her own. That was Rose Escobar's dream. 
</P>
<P>
She wasn't looking for anything fancy -- just a nice little house for herself 
and her two children, with a yard for her grandson to play in. 
</P>
<P>
The dream of home ownership is shared passionately by many, but Escobar, 44, a 
single working mother with a modest income, got her own piece of that dream in 
an unusual way. For $5,500, Escobar bought a house that was being moved to make 
way for a hospital parking lot in Anaheim and had it relocated to a 
family-owned lot a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Although Escobar had a few problems, and cautions that her approach to home 
ownership may not be for everyone, she's happy with the outcome because it 
meant that she and her family were able to greet the New Year in their own, 
newly renovated home. 
</P>
<P>
The Garden Grove hairdresser's original plan had been to borrow just enough to 
add to her savings and to either buy or build a suitable home. 
</P>
<P>
She began by making the rounds to local banks and other lenders. The answer was 
always the same: Escobar had little chance of qualifying for a conventional 
home loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just about given up," she recalled, "when my sister, who works near Snow 
House Movers in Santa Ana, came up with the idea of moving a house to the lot 
where we had lived as children and which my father was willing to share with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
"I . . . learned (Snow Movers) had just purchased five houses from Anaheim 
Memorial Hospital . . . and that they were immediately available. I bought the 
best one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar's 1,400-square-foot "move-on" (an industry term for structures on the 
move) was built 30 years ago. It has three bedrooms and a den. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar paid Snow $15,000 to move the house 10 miles from the hospital property 
to the family lot. 
</P>
<P>
The total cost for buying, moving and renovating the house came to $69,000, 
which Escobar paid from a short-term construction loan she obtained by using 
the lot as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
She expects to be able repay the loan soon by refinancing the property, which 
also includes an existing structure, and is now valued in excess of $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Moving a house may not be for everyone, Escobar admits, least of all a "novice" 
like herself. 
</P>
<P>
The move-on process is much more complicated than buying a house, and includes 
obtaining permits, bonds and certificate of occupancy, and dealing with 
lenders, movers, insurance underwriters, contractors and inspectors. And that's 
after buying the lot. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to know what you're getting into," Escobar said. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics in the resurging move-on business -- which peaked in the 1950s and 
'60s when new freeways were being built and declined in recent years -- are 
hard to isolate because they are lumped in with other city relocation records. 
</P>
<P>
But one Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety official estimated that 
about six to eight single-family or multiple residential buildings are moved 
each week in the greater Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
John Cawley, an insurance underwriter whose firm has issued relocation 
completion (or performance) bonds for 40 years, offered a broader view. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on our business dealings with house movers and brokers throughout Los 
Angeles and Orange counties, I would say a minimum of 100 units are moved each 
month in both counties." 
</P>
<P>
He also said that more and more dwellings are being moved in Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties, where unimproved land is more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the key, of course," Cawley said. "You have to have to own the land 
first." 
</P>
<P>
A move-on house can be bought, moved and renovated in the Southland for about 
$34 a square foot, while new construction usually starts at about $70 a square 
foot for comparable value in materials and styling, said Arnie Corlin, a 
move-on broker. 
</P>
<P>
Corlin, who prefers to be called a "facilitator," has assisted with the moving 
of more than 100 structures in the past four years. He keeps close tabs on 
available stock and dwellings that may become available in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps a file filled with color photos of available properties to help his 
clients choose from among several hundred single- or multifamily units. 
</P>
<P>
"People are surprised at the range of good homes and apartment buildings that 
are available," Corlin said. "Good two or three bedroom homes can be had, 
delivered to the lot, for between $18,000 to $28,000. Apartments are going for 
about $11,000 to $14,000 per unit delivered." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of a lot in a good location is probably the biggest expense in a 
move-on budget. The next major cost is the rehab of the structure, which 
involves pouring a new foundation and "sewing up" any cuts required to move it, 
and general renovation. Rehab costs will vary according to how much new wiring 
and plumbing is done and whether there are changes or additions to the original 
floor plan. 
</P>
<P>
One can estimate that the average 1,500-square-foot house costs about $13 a 
square foot to buy and to move, and an additional $20 a square foot to rehab 
it, said Rod Daniels, who has moved about 50 houses in the San Fernando Valley. 
"And that would include permit costs, landscaping and even carpets and drapes," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dunham, a realtor whose interest in preservation real estate led him into 
moving buildings and showing others how to do it, believes "move-ons are a 
viable housing resource for people who have little money and plenty of 
gumption." 
</P>
<P>
In his all-day "House Relocator" seminars, held periodically in Los Angeles, 
Dunham cautions that house moving is not without risks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people should know that there's a lot more to it than an opportunity 
to own a beautiful building for a (minimal) price," he maintains. "But as an 
investment it's a sleeper. If done right, there can be some real benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Proper planning is crucial, Dunham said. 
</P>
<P>
In figuring the feasibility of a project, Dunham stressed that it is "essential 
to do one's homework and to know the resources that can help expedite the job." 
</P>
<P>
Doing one's homework, he said, means knowing ordinances for move-ons in a given 
neighborhood, checking the compatibility of building to site before any 
purchase commitment is made and understanding the economics involved. 
</P>
<P>
His students learn that there are many variables that affect the percentages 
relating to land, building and rehab costs, and miscellaneous expenditures in 
the move-on budget, which can include sanitary facilities, power poles, 
construction fences and on-site sheds. 
</P>
<P>
But as an example, he said, total costs for a 1,500-square-foot move-on with a 
final appraisal value of $200,000 would typically be about 75%. 
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian-born Dr. Selam Aklilu, a 30-year-old chiropractor and newcomer to 
this country, lives in a charming vintage home in Los Angeles that was moved 
from Caltech property in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Her total expenditure for the lot and renovation of the three-bedroom move-on 
was $130,000. A current appraisal sets the property value at $270,000. 
</P>
<P>
Aklilu's opportunity for home ownership came from a classified ad placed by 
Caltech in The Times announcing the university's intention to give away several 
houses on its property to qualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, this 'land of opportunity' is not a myth," Aklilu said. "We were one 
of four lucky applicants chosen to receive the free houses." 
</P>
<P>
When she first arrived here as a student 10 years ago, Aklilu's goals were to 
become a doctor of chiropractic and to own a home. 
</P>
<P>
"I read everything I could about real estate, scanned every home-for-sale ad in 
the classified section, saved every penny toward buying real estate," Aklilu 
said. "Eventually, my husband and I were able to put a down payment on a 
$55,000 lot." 
</P>
<P>
After Aklilu was given the house by Caltech, family members joined together to 
loan her and her husband $80,000 to pay house moving and extensive remodeling 
costs, Aklilu said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Rose Escobar, Aklilu bypassed some of the frustrations of house moving 
by hiring facilitator Corlin, who obtained the required permits and generally 
guided the couple through the process. 
</P>
<P>
Those who own a lot but do not have the advantage of financial backing or a top 
credit rating may still be candidates for the move-on option, said Lynda Viera, 
senior loan officer at Community Thrift &amp; Loan in Monterey Park, one of a 
few lenders handling such loans. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not too many direct lenders that are FDIC-insured who are willing to 
take on these house-moving projects. But for those of us who do, it is 
primarily the project that qualifies rather than the applicant," Viera said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each project is evaluated independently on loan to value and on the 
credibility of the borrower, of course, but that does not exclude loans to 
people with a less-than-prime credit rating," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Move-on loans are much like conventional construction loans, and usually take 
three to four weeks to process, underwrite and fund. They do not record until a 
building is physically positioned on the site. 
</P>
<P>
Financing is based on 65% of the value of the property at completion, and funds 
are disbursed through an in-house funding control voucher system, Viera said. 
</P>
<P>
Randall T. Adams, an owner of Westworld Financial, a Woodland Hills 
construction lender that pioneered the mechanics of move-on financing, said a 
move-on loan by Westworld would be considered from the standpoint of location, 
equity, income and credit worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
"While most financing offered for move-on projects is limited to a nine-month 
loan, (we write) loans for a one-year term, allowing the borrower sufficient 
time to both complete the project and arrange permanent financing," Adams 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
For veteran hands-on investor Daniels, moving buildings is both "challenging 
and exciting." Daniels is in the process of relocating the historic McKinley 
Mansion from Lafayette Park Place in Los Angeles to Monteria Estates in 
Chatsworth, where Daniels and his wife, Sherry, plan to live with their 
children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The token purchase price for the mansion was $1, Daniels said. He also paid a 
$15,000 finder's fee to a broker. "This saved the developer about $75,000 in 
demolition and dump costs," Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can teach anyone how to recycle a house, but you can't teach everyone how 
to build one," Daniels commented. "Moving a house is 10 times easier and 
faster." 
</P>
<P>
Actor/developer James P. McNichol, a newcomer to the move-on world, is excited 
about his house-moving projects. 
</P>
<P>
He recently acquired two units that were part of an apartment complex earmarked 
for demolition and had them moved to a lot in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The units have been joined together and turned into one spacious home, which I 
now occupy," McNichol said. "It's really fascinating to work with these kinds 
of options." 
</P>
<P>
In a second project, with Corlin and other friends, McNichol recently moved a 
6,200-square-foot luxury Westside duplex to Brentwood. The units have since 
been reassembled and refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
"The structure has 9-foot ceilings and beautiful architectural details," he 
said. "When we get done with the renovation, the property will be comparable to 
the best in Brentwood." 
</P>

Can Southern California's diverse economic strength overcome declining defense

CHECKLIST OF TASKS FOR A SMOOTH HOUSE MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are the main steps in the house-moving process: 
</P>
<P>
* Find the lot. Recruit realtors to help, scan the newspaper's classified 
section for lots-for-sale by owner and track down empty lots and their owners. 
Research the potential of the area you are moving to. 
</P>
<P>
Choose an improved, flat city lot or one that has a level building pad. Know 
its legal description, sewer and gas access, zoning and setback requirements, 
whether any liens or easements exist and if move-ons are approved for the area; 
check local parking requirements and height restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
* Find the house. Houses may be found through the classified section in 
newspapers, public auctions, a move-on broker or house movers. Unless the buyer 
wants a structure of historic value, it is best to pick a house built after 
1950 to lessen chances of dry-rot and other problems connected with the age of 
a building. 
</P>
<P>
Choose one that is compatible with the neighborhood and the site; find out 
whether it is a complex move that requires several cuts to the building and 
consider the improvement-to-land ratio in the area and potential resale of 
similar properties. 
</P>
<P>
* Get a permit. Each city requires a valid permit to move a building. 
Applicants must apply with the relocation division of the Building &amp; Safety 
Department and provide the permit office with a simple plot plan indicating 
site and house measurements and proposed siting of the move-on. 
</P>
<P>
Within five to 10 working days, a relocation inspector will inspect the lot and 
the structure to be moved. Permits are valid for 120 days. Permit fees for a 
move within the city run $480 for a dwelling up to 2,500 square feet, and $180 
for each 10,000 additional square feet; when a building is relocated from the 
county to the city of Los Angeles, an additional permit fee of $300 must be 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
* Purchase a bond. A completion or performance bond is required as part of the 
move-on process, at a value determined by the city that is usually 65% of the 
house plus 10%. A completion bond is obtained from a bonding company or 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
* Find a lender. Relocation loans are not in the mainstream of real estate 
investment. The sources are limited and the costs are usually high. Relocating 
a building is more complicated because one is not borrowing on a "packaged 
deal" but on a lot and a house in separate locations, with the concurrent costs 
of getting them together and rehabilitated to meet the requirements of the 
local municipality. 
</P>
<P>
House movers usually know which lenders are familiar with move-on loans and are 
willing to provide them. 
</P>
<P>
* Hire a house mover. Once a city permit number has been issued, the house 
mover begins his work. The house is split, jacked up, and steel beams are 
placed under it. Dollies with wheels are then slipped under the structure to 
make it mobile. Moves occur at night, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., 
as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
When the house arrives at the site, it is positioned at a predetermined spot 
and "cribbed up" -- sustained by a framework -- to allow the contractor to pour 
the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The mover returns to lower the house onto the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
* Choose a contractor. Contractors, as well as house movers, should be bonded 
and insured. The contractor begins by building a new foundation on the new site 
based on the footprint of the move-on. He will also "sew up the building," 
renovate and hook up the structure's plumbing and wiring to bring it up to code 
and ready to function. The same contractor may also be contracted to do the 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
* Get certificate of occupancy. To get a certificate of occupancy for a move-on 
(a city requirement) all repairs listed by the relocation inspector must be 
fulfilled.

APARTMENT LIFE: LANDLORDS CAN'T COLLECT DOUBLE RENT ON LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN B. POSTEMA, Postema is editor of Apartment Age Magazine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am writing on behalf of a young couple who recently moved to this 
country. Their English is limited and they are in a predicament. Here is the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
They signed a one-year lease and moved into their Bellflower apartment, but 
after living there for four months, they realized how unsafe the building's 
location was and moved. They gave the rental office a 30-day notice of their 
intent to move. A representative of the office gave them back a receipt saying 
that they left the apartment clean and undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
Now, they have received an accounting from a collection agency saying that they 
owe the apartment owners six months' rent, the amount of time left on the 
lease. Their security deposit was deducted from the balance of the allegedly 
owed rent. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment has been re-rented to another party and it seems unfair that my 
friends should have to pay rent for the balance of their lease too. Can 
apartment owners collect double rent like this or is it illegal? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Apartment owners in California may not collect double rents. Your 
friends only owe from the time they vacated the unit until it was re-rented. 
They should inform the collection agency and rental office of this fact. 
</P>
<P>
If you know, or can find out, when the unit was re-rented, your friends may be 
entitled to a refund. If the unit was re-rented before the deposit was used up, 
based upon the daily rental value of the premises, your friends are entitled to 
a refund of the balance of the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your friends are not entitled to a refund, they will want to clear this 
matter up to avoid a blemish on their credit files. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant Wants Owner to Repair Phone Jacks 
</P>
<P>
Q: My Brentwood tenant wants three telephone jacks repaired by me. Apparently, 
they were working when she moved in. GTE wants $85 an hour to fix them because 
she doesn't have "wiring insurance." She says I should pay. 
</P>
<P>
Phone jacks, she argues, are like electrical outlets. She claims that if it's 
inside the owner's building, it's the owner's responsibility. She has a point, 
but I'm not sure she's right. If I do have to fix the jacks, do I have to let 
the phone company fix them or can I use someone else? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most phone companies, since deregulation a few years ago, have offered 
renters inside wiring insurance. The reason the phone companies offer the 
insurance to renters is because renters are responsible for fixing it. 
</P>
<P>
For your tenant's information, she is not required to use the phone company to 
repair the phone jacks. 
</P>
<P>
Evicted Renter Asks About Relocation Pay 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was amazed to read in your Jan. 21 column about the $2,000 relocation fee 
that is due to those relocated because of landlords' family members taking over 
their apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
I am wondering if this matter can be pursued after the fact. Last April I had 
to move after my landlord gave me one month's notice to vacate my Van Nuys 
garage apartment so his son could move in. He gave me notice on March 4 and I 
was out by April 4. 
</P>
<P>
Am I still eligible for the relocation fees, if any are due me? If I am 
eligible, how do I go about collecting them? 
</P>
<P>
A: If the rental unit is rent-controlled, you may be eligible for the fees. If 
the garage unit is the only rental unit on the lot, and it is unattached to any 
other housing unit, such as a house, it is probably exempted from the law and 
ineligible for the fees. Similarly, the garage unit may be exempted if it is 
new construction, as defined by the rent law. 
</P>
<P>
Check with the city's Rent Stabilization Division (RSD) at (213) 624-RENT to 
find out if the unit is rent-controlled. If it is, you can report the situation 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
According to RSD Director Barbara Zeidman, you should also sue the former owner 
in Small Claims Court for the $2,000, which is the court's upper limit for 
lawsuits. Time is a concern to file this small claims action since you must 
file suit in the court within one year of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Can Rent Be Withheld for Lack of Cooling? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide me with about my 
Fullerton apartment dilemma. I have been living here for about five months. The 
complex is large, 100 to 150 units, and I have no idea whether it is under rent 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the problem. Since the day I moved in, the central air conditioning has 
never worked. After about three months, I decided to deduct some money out of 
my rent to compensate for the lack of air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
The manager told me she couldn't accept a partial payment for rent. She said 
she would contact the central office to see what could be done. A month has 
passed and I have heard nothing. 
</P>
<P>
I don't feel it is fair to pay for something you do not get. Do I have any 
recourse? 
</P>
<P>
A: Under California law, you may withhold all or a portion of the monthly rent 
in the event that there is a breach of the warranty of habitability. That 
includes all of the basic living essentials, such as electrical, heating, 
water, roofing, insulation and so forth. Also, you may deduct all or a portion 
of the monthly rent and spend the money to repair a code violation defect. 
</P>
<P>
If you withhold or spend rent, and a court finds that your action was 
unwarranted, you may be evicted. If any amount you withheld or spent is found 
to be justified, then you win. 
</P>
<P>
Withholding for air conditioning is marginal. The issue then becomes: Would you 
have rented the apartment without air conditioning? If the air conditioning 
(which many apartments do not have at all) was a substantial inducement to you 
to rent, then your withholding may be justified and the owner should fix it.

<TEXT>
<P>
I was brought up with a strict sense of duty. I had to profess certain 
ideological principles, to love the proletariats of all countries and to defend 
them from imperialist intrigues. It was explained to me all the time "who was 
who" and "who had the right to what." My schooling, my medical treatment, my 
home, my job -- the state indefatigably took care of all of them for me. Who my 
doctor was and where he or she could treat me were prescribed. There were no 
exceptions. I had no choice but to learn from the sanctioned textbooks in a 
strictly controlled institution. The hospital in which I was born reflected my 
parents' rank and place of residence -- a designated apartment. The price of 
the food I ate -- my eventual salary -- were set by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The word "freedom" itself was suspect. Its connotations -- its very definitions 
-- were always negative. 
</P>
<P>
My way of life and that of the vast majority of Soviet citizens is, in short, 
as different from yours as American football is from European soccer. For 
Americans to understand perestroika, they must realize how much we will have to 
overcome to become part of humanity, because our paths to that goal are so 
different. Thus, I feel the need to write -- so you will understand us better. 
</P>
<P>
I was weaned from the concept of freedom much as submarine crew members are 
trained not to breathe freely. Yet, over the past few years, the world has 
sensed how great is our genetic code for freedom. It's similar to the latent 
resiliency in a branch that has been bent to the ground under the weight of 
winter's snow: As soon as the snow melts, it springs back. 
</P>
<P>
The snow has not yet melted, and we are already springing back. We're learning 
how to speak our minds without fearing the person at the adjacent table or the 
possibility that an unknown listener may be on the telephone line. The 
prescribed patriotism that was our lifelong duty to honor is being replaced by 
responsibility for our life and our country. We have learned to call things by 
their proper names. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party was 
concluded the second week of February. The party leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
called for an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. This was 
essentially a confirmation of what is already occurring in the country: The 
developing democratic processes have broken the party's monopoly. Many party 
members also came to understand that increasingly associated with their 
monopoly on power is responsibility for the state of our society. 
</P>
<P>
Changes are taking place very quickly. Events are piling up. The clock of 
history is running fast. Throughout, it's important not to lose contact with 
the political activism of the masses, which is growing swiftly. The masses are 
not organized in any real sense; that is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing to fly from the awakening popular volcano will be a clod of 
dirt. The conservative forces are sending little packs of chauvinists in black 
overcoats into the streets to threaten pogroms and intimidate people. But the 
lava is stirring and organizing itself. 
</P>
<P>
After a writers' meeting was broken up by fascist-style organizers last month, 
I invited several leaders of the semi-formal Moscow associations to the 
editorial offices of our magazine, Ogonyok. They urged that an 
anti-conservative demonstration be held to demonstrate mass support for 
Gorbachev and his democratic reforms. All understood that the Soviet system is 
incapable of offering anyone more liberal than Gorbachev. Leftist attempts to 
shake his position may lead not to a more liberal leader but to a Soviet 
Pinochet. 
</P>
<P>
My visitors said that such a demonstration would attract 200,000 people. I 
thought they were boasting. I was wrong: More than 200,000 marched to the walls 
of the Kremlin on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing to speak to the swaying ocean of heads, I thought again of how the 
people are attracted to freedom, of how quickly they become fearless, of how 
hard it will be to stop them now that they are awakened. Moreover, the 
fearlessness of a people prepared to accept responsibility for the fate of 
their society and their country must be appreciated. What is wonderful about 
the present process is that it shows how desperate the people's determination 
is to stand up for integrity and freedom, and how doomed are the attempts to 
intimidate them again. 
</P>
<P>
These days, I try not to leave Moscow for long, because perestroika is 
imperiled. I am informed in ominous tones that our magazine will make a mistake 
and "be exposed." With Ogonyok's circulation reaching 14.5 million, we are 
constantly being reproached for having so large a readership. Our color 
supplements are taken away; the printing process is dragged out. Working 
conditions are much more difficult. Our pay is very little. Only the salaries 
of party bureaucrats and those who work for party publications are being 
raised. All this and more is being done to scare away our best employees or to 
silence our magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The people do not hide their desire to overcome inequity. Many of the roots of 
disintegrated movements, both in the Communist Party and in the country, are 
traceable to the desire to break away quickly from an inequitably organized 
whole to create a small but honestly conducted association of like minds or 
nationality. Not that long ago in the Ukrainian town of Chernigov, the local 
authorities were overthrown. The flash point was the baggage compartment of a 
car belonging to one of the officials that popped open in the town's central 
square. A volume of the classics of Marxism was not inside. Instead, delicacies 
long absent from the local grocery stores were found. 
</P>
<P>
People in my country are monstrously cut off from the fruits of their labor, 
yet another reason why they work poorly. The agricultural industry cannot feed 
the most expansive and resource-rich country in the world because the peasants 
do not understand who they are working for. Sometimes peasants who produce 
grain must travel to town to buy baked bread. Those who raise livestock have no 
idea where the sausage made from their meat is sold. The bureaucratic state has 
strikingly distanced itself from its own people. 
</P>
<P>
This is why the process of perestroika is so difficult and multilayered and why 
attempts to achieve new goals using former production methods are pointless. 
But it's unclear how to get away from the former leaders. It is like the 
Australian who bought a new boomerang but went out of his mind because he 
couldn't get rid of the old one. 
</P>
<P>
There are growing signs of bureaucratic opposition to perestroika. Be 
attentive. While getting caught up in the colorfulness of revolutionary 
flashiness, you sometimes lose sight of the main thing -- the difficult process 
of real change and the routine of renovation. The forces opposing perestroika 
and democratization are reaching the end of their self-imposed deadline. I feel 
their hatred with my skin, with my mind. I have known it my entire life, and I 
am tired of it. But I do not see any way out -- except for a daily struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Understand yet another peculiarity of our society: It has practically never 
known a multiparty system. The authority of the almighty chief, with his right 
to punish and pardon, has eaten into the genetic code of every one of us, and 
into our historical memory. It presses on us like an enormous lump of fear. We 
are becoming a part of humanity with difficulty, but we are doing it. I 
received a letter from a reader of Ogonyok in California. "What have you come 
to?" she wrote in reference to the magazine's struggle against social 
privileges. "What falls under the category of social privileges, to your mind? 
The right of a government minister to get a pound of frankfurters without 
waiting in line? The right to get a tooth filled in a clean clinic? The right 
for a three-member family to move into a three-room apartment? Just think of 
how that looks from the outside . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The rights of the people, and the struggle for these rights, is an unstoppable 
right in all the countries of the world. Every people has its own concerns, but 
all the same we are growing together in terms of our humanity and our concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Life is short and stormy. I just received a telephone call from Kharkov, the 
town in the Ukraine that elected me to Parliament. I was read the resolution of 
an anti-conservative meeting. An action committee is also meeting in Moscow to 
discuss the formation of a new political party. The postal carrier has just 
delivered yet another anonymous, threatening letter. Life, swirling all around, 
has never been so intense, so dangerous -- so full of hope. The cost of 
happiness is struggle and sometimes life itself, and now is the time for us to 
win our happiness. This is very hard.

JAPAN'S RESTLESS VOTERS COULD THROW THE RASCALS OUT; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: A SOCIALIST VICTORY COULD BE GOOD FOR JAPANESE DEMOCRACY, BUT THE 
SCANDAL-TAINTED RULING PARTY WILL PROBABLY GET A MAJORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

University.

<TEXT>
<P>
Japan is at a political turning point. More important, this turning point is a 
democratic one. 
</P>
<P>
Being callous Euro-Americans -- those U.S. citizens who find their intellectual 
identity in the culture of Europe -- revisionist critics of Japanese politics 
have been keen to draw the fault line between Western and Asian civilization 
with a racial and nationalist cast. This error is compounded by their dogmatic 
insistence that contemporary Japan is neither liberal nor democratic -- it's 
merely a modernized version of the collective darkness of Asian misrule. The 
fact that Bush Administration policies toward Tokyo have been tainted by these 
unsober musings only highlights the dangers involved. 
</P>
<P>
Japan goes to the polls today in a crucial parliamentary election. The stakes 
include control of the Japanese lower house, and thus the government. There is 
a small chance that Japanese voters will do the previously unthinkable: turn 
the rascals out. This would spell the end of 34 years of unbroken rule by the 
conservative and largely pro-American Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese voters are certainly restless. A palpable irritation with the corrupt 
complacencies of the Liberal Democrats infuses the national mood. Nowhere do 
such feelings threaten to have greater impact than in the third voting district 
of Gumma Prefecture, near Tokyo. That is the stronghold of former Prime 
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Nakasone's infamous remark about the intelligence levels of blacks and 
Puerto Ricans, he remains one of America's most important friends in the 
Japanese Diet (Asia's oldest parliament). Would his defeat mark a new maturity 
for Japanese democracy? 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone was, by all accounts, deeply involved in the Recruit affair, the 
influence-peddling scandal that brought down Noboru Takeshita's Cabinet and 
helped pave the way for the crushing defeat of the Liberal Democratic Party in 
last summer's upper-house elections. The opposition, centered on the Japan 
Socialist Party, now controls the constitutionally weaker chamber for the first 
time since the Liberal Democratic Party was formed in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Recruit scandal, Nakasone quit the ruling party and 
abandoned leadership of his faction to atone for his perceived wrongdoings. The 
Tokyo Public Prosecutor failed to take him to court, but Nakasone now faces the 
possible humiliation of rejection at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
If so, an iron law of Japanese electoral behavior -- that political corruption 
is never punished at the polls if it is viewed as serving local interests -- 
would have to be recast. Farmers will largely determine Nakasone's fate. He may 
thus become a victim of a wider turbulence that has shaken the traditional 
political allegiances of Japan's rural voters during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the central conundrum of modern Japanese social policy: How to bind 
the country's traditionally disadvantaged rural communities to the body politic 
without derailing the nation's economic advance? This quest is not idle. Farmer 
disaffection fatally undermined Japan's prewar experiment with party democracy.

After Japan's defeat in 1945, the American occupation tried to "solve" the 
rural problem with massive land reform. What Japan's modernizers had failed to 
achieve in 60 years, Gen. Douglas MacArthur's bureaucrats managed in fewer than 
five. Though revisionists in the United States are fond of dismissing Japan's 
American interlude as a sham, these land reforms and the subsequent 
overweighting of rural representation in the Diet made Japan's farmers a power 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, Japan's conservative politicians rushed to contain the most 
liquid moment in postwar rural politics. The resulting dependence of 
conservative parties -- later, the Liberal Democratic Party -- on rural voters 
has persisted. This factor will help decide whether the ruling party captures 
the minimum 257 seats necessary to maintain a majority in the Diet. 
</P>
<P>
As support for the LDP has waned, the Japan Socialist Party has experienced a 
spectacular revival. Having carried only 85 seats in the last lower-house vote, 
the Socialists are too weak to take on the Liberal Democrats alone. But today 
they could win, by generous estimate, 152 seats (pessimists insist on a much 
lower figure). In coalition, the Socialists could take power. 
</P>
<P>
A Socialist victory could be good for Japanese democracy. Like France in 1981 
after years of Gaullist rule, Japan needs a change of party. Takako Doi, the 
first women to head the Japan Socialist Party, could be her country's answer to 
Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist who ended a generation of French 
conservative domination. 
</P>
<P>
The party, to be sure, has no recent experience of governing the country. It 
might stumble badly after taking power (as Mitterrand did). But nothing would 
awaken the Japan Socialist Party more sharply from its Marxist dreams and 
neutralist pretensions than a splash of bracing power. In any case, its more 
moderate coalition partners would block any radical nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Socialist rule would be a risk, but with the fundamentals of the 
Japanese economy so strong, it is one that Japan and the world can afford. The 
Liberal Democratic Party clearly needs a rest. More important, the full 
maturation of Japanese democracy is inconsistent with one-party rule -- even if 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
There are good reasons for thinking that this quiet revolution will not happen. 
Though it may lose 40 of the 300 seats it won in 1986, the LDP will probably 
retain 
</P>
<P>
at least 260 seats, yielding a majority, plus three. Even the wily Nakasone may 
keep his seat. 
</P>
<P>
But the Socialists may come closer to real power than at any time since 1948. 
Whatever today's outcome, they and their allies will dominate the upper house 
for the next five years. This makes some form of coalition politics almost 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a larger point: The prospect of a peaceful ballot-box revolution, 
viewed in the light of Japan's postwar embrace of democratic government, should 
make it clear to even the most prejudiced revisionist that Japan, democracy's 
greatest (some would say only) East Asian province, cannot be cast into the 
outer darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Making -- and keeping -- Japan democratic has been the central goal of America 
foreign policy in the Pacific during the postwar period. It is the Japanese who 
have made a success of their democracy, though we have helped. Sometimes, our 
help has been decisive. In Japan, as no where else in Asia, we have won hearts 
and minds in ways that honor our Founding Fathers and their democratic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
As we start rethinking relationships with Japan, we must keep in mind this 
postwar achievement and our role in it. The Japanese have not forgotten; nor 
should we.

FREE AT LAST, MANDELA ENTERS A LARGER JAIL: OPPRESSIVE APARTHEID LAWS STILL IN 
FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AFRICA: THERE SEEMS INCREASINGLY LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND 
ANC POSITIONS. IT IS THEIR VISIONS OF A NEW NATION THAT DIFFER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson Mandela has been freed, released from a small prison into the greater 
jail of apartheid that imprisons all South Africans, black and white. 
</P>
<P>
While about 200,000 Sowetans were cheering Mandela at a Tuesday rally outside 
Johannesburg, Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen was telling a 
Cape Town press conference that the government agreed with the African National 
Congress: The remains of apartheid should be removed. He also said the 
government agreed there must be universal suffrage in a united, democratic 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC has called for a united, non-racial and democratic nation. Viljoen said 
there would never again be a whites-only election and that in a new 
constitution the National Party was unlikely to have control of government. 
Superficially there seems increasingly little difference between what the 
government is saying and what the ANC is demanding. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately both sides seek power and both want peace. It is their visions of a 
new South Africa that differ. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate future the government wants international sanctions lifted; 
the ANC is opposed to the lifting of sanctions, seeing them as a vital, 
nonviolent weapon that has brought the government to its current willingness to 
negotiate with blacks after 78 years of ignoring, suppressing and killing ANC 
members who appealled for dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and other anti-apartheid forces fear that if the pressure of sanctions 
eases, so too will the white government's desire to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
In the West there appears to be sentiment -- conveyed by British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher -- that the South African government of President Frederick 
W. de Klerk should be "rewarded" for releasing Mandela from his nearly 28-year 
incarceration and for relaxing a few repressive measures. 
</P>
<P>
But De Klerk has not touched the fundamental pillars of apartheid, which 
remain. Nelson Mandela, as an example, is not a South African citizen in terms 
of apartheid law. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 15% of the blacks have been recognized as citizens of South Africa. 
The rest of them have been forced to adopt the "citizenship" of the much-hated 
Bantustans, or homelands, which formed a cornerstone to apartheid policy by 
denying the right of blacks to be citizens of -- or to live in -- white South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Whites swallowed up 85% of the land, leaving the remaining 15% for black 
"foreigners" who were born and worked on white soil. 
</P>
<P>
Technically Mandela is a citizen, even though he refuses to accept citizenship, 
of the Transkei Bantustan. White South Africa created and gave "independence" 
to it in 1978 -- an independence that none of the world recognizes, not even 
the Transkeians, who are currently trying to negotiate their reincorporation 
into South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the government said it will consider making blacks full citizens of 
South Africa once more. But what of all the other apartheid laws? In this 
context, Thatcher's idea of a reward seems less than appealing. Should white 
South Africans be rewarded for lifting minor elements of a policy that was 
morally repugnant when adopted? 
</P>
<P>
While Thatcher talks of easing economic sanctions, the De Klerk government has 
not proposed creation of a unitary education system to replace one now divided 
on the basis of race and apartheid into 18 separate deparments. 
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy pressure from the black community and increasing pressure from 
anti-apartheid elements within the white community, the Pretoria government has 
said that school desegregation is not negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
Last year more than 200 white schools closed because there were not enough 
white pupils. In black schools the teacher-pupil ratio has reached a staggering 
1-90. Five times more is spent on the education of each white child; white 
children enjoy a teacher-pupil ratio of 1-16. There is a black teacher shortage 
of 300,000. Among those who currently teach, more than three-quarters are 
underqualified and have received no formal teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
In the white community there is so little interest in teaching as a profession 
that four teacher-training colleges were closed down last year. There are 
almost 2,000 vacancies in white teacher-training colleges, which refuse to 
admit black students. 
</P>
<P>
While removal of sanctions is the reward sought by De Klerk's government, the 
ANC's immediate goal is the liberation of political activity -- two of Franklin 
D. Roosevelt's four freedoms: freedom of speech and freedom of association. 
</P>
<P>
The government, however, says if this is permitted violence will escalate as 
rival factions from left and right, white and black, battle for power. 
Officials say there is still a need to circumscribe political activity. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC and United Democratic Front argue otherwise, claiming these restraints 
on political mobilization make political violence more likely, arguing that 
people who have a communal responsibility within the framework of a political 
organization are less likely to resort to anti-social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of political restraints would be a challenge to members of the 
democratic anti-apartheid movement; they would have to start behaving like 
political parties and not guerrilla or protest movements. As it is now, the 
government still holds a vast array of security legislation on its books. For 
example, although the ANC is unbanned, the law that banned it remains intact. 
Although hundreds of people who could not be quoted or move freely have had 
their restrictions lifted, the laws that curbed their lives remain in effect. 
</P>
<P>
For negotiations to take place, a whole new climate of mutual trust must be 
created. 
</P>
<P>
The white press has criticized the ANC's commitment to continue the armed 
struggle, although it is not involving its followers in acts of violence. 
Nonetheless, the government also continues to expand and mobilize its armed 
forces. This January almost 30,000 school graduates began military training, 
even though both the government and ANC concede that warfare is not an option. 
</P>
<P>
The government cannot afford another war on the heels of the Namibian conflict, 
so demoralizing in its human and financial costs. The ANC, meanwhile, has all 
but stopped violent acts and has acknowledged that it does not have the 
capacity to intensify the armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are setting the stage for a cessation of hostilities followed by a 
mutually negotiated cease-fire. The first steps should begin after Mandela 
visits ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, this week. The ANC said Friday it 
would meet soon with De Klerk to help create a climate for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
White South Africa at last is recognizing it cannot hold power, or control, 
forever.

HUNGARY: NON-COMMUNISTS, ANTI-COMMUNISTS AND FORMER PARTY MEMBERS STRUGGLE FOR 
POLITICAL POSITION IN THE POST-COMMUNIST ERA.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is fashionable to lament the state of American democracy and its leaders and 
to extoll the exuberance and intellectual ferment occuring in Eastern Europe. 
Most of the accolades are directed at Czechoslovakia and its new 
playwright-president, Vaclav Havel. A friend of mine, an admitted Havel 
groupie, recently told me that Havel's first play is an eerily prescient view 
of the continuing collapse of communism. Havel even included one of the play's 
lines in his inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
But heady optimism and lyrical political discourse are hardly uniform 
throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
I met Gyula Kodolanyi -- Hungary's answer to Havel -- at his home in the Buda 
hills above Budapest on the final day of the 1980s. A playwright and essayist 
(novels bore him "because they are not as dense as poetry or a good essay"), he 
displayed a relaxed and friendly manner. He was less the political leader he 
has become than the professor of comparative literature he always was. 
</P>
<P>
"Hungary had no 1981," Kodolanyi said, regretfully. He was referring to the 
Gdansk shipyard uprising that thrust Solidarity upon the scene. He might as 
well have said that his country "had no 1989," either. Hungary experienced no 
dramatic, cathartic turn toward freedom as did the other East European nations. 
Its move toward liberalization began two years earlier. Democratization is 
slow, almost imperceptible, and to some extent disillusioning for Hungarians. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary is undergoing a political shakeout as non-communists, anti-communists 
and former communists struggle to position themselves for the post-communist 
era. One reason for the apparent confusion and disorder is that there was no 
galvanizing, central force -- a la Poland's Solidarity -- that opened the door 
to freedom and can serve as the obvious replacement for the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Given the country's relatively mature democracy, the issues, by definition, are 
not inspired by "first principles." Rather, they are the mundane questions of 
second-best solutions. In short, Hungarian politics, and the 
person-on-the-street's reaction to it, is more akin to American politics than 
to what is going on in Czechoslovakia. More than one Hungarian complained to me 
that the nation's politicians seemed to spend more time arguing about 
personalities, party alignments and politics than debating how to improve the 
country's lot. There were frequent envious references to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
But there is meaningful debate among Hungarian politicians as they struggle to 
find the right democratic capitalist formula for their country. Kodolanyi, 
co-leader of Hungary's chapter of the Helsinki Watch, a group that monitors 
human-rights accords, also was a founder, in the early '80s, of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, an organization of intellectual dissidents. It has now 
emerged as the leading opposition party in Hungary and will probably capture 
more than 40% of the votes in the country's first free parliamentary elections 
next month. The Democratic Forum is brazenly free-market. Even Austria's or 
Scandinavia's mild socialism is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Ferenzo Koszeg, Kodolanyi's co-chair of the Helsinki Watch group, is a leader 
of the Free Democrats, a party to the left, if you will, of the Forum. He lives 
in a comfortable apartment above Budapest's most fashionable shopping street, 
the Vaci. Koszeg is soft-spoken but intense. The vice in the Democratic Forum's 
platform, says Koszeg and his fellow Free Democrats, is indifference to the 
need for a social safety net. 
</P>
<P>
Szilard Nyakas, a radio commentator and member of the Independent Social 
Democratic Party, echoes Koszeg's views. But the Social Democrats, which come 
in two other flavors besides the Independents, envision a more active and 
pervasive state role in economic management. They also worry about the class 
divisions that will "inevitably" result from the switch to a free economy. 
During our conversation, Nyakas frequently peppered his speech with Marxisms. 
</P>
<P>
But, in virtually identical language, all three men -- Kodolanyi, Koszeg, and 
Nyakas -- said that the Communists now have "no credit," meaning no credibility 
with or support from the populace. (The leading opposition paper is called 
Credit.) Only through "demagoguery" can the Communists return to power. But all 
three, to varying degrees, see this as a possibility, since the country's 
economic position is weak. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has the highest per capita debt of any nation in Europe. Most 
Hungarians expect the economy to deteriorate markedly in the next year or so. 
Even the most optimistic speak of serious unemployment. The opposition figures 
with whom I spoke worry that the country's brewing economic crisis will turn 
the people against their new free government, allowing the Communists to ride 
back to power as latter-day Huey Longs. 
</P>
<P>
There is widespread bafflement about why President Bush has not rushed to 
bolster the country's turn toward democracy. Still, despite our romanticized 
visions of "captive nations" yearning to breathe free, as Bush put it during 
his visit to Hungary, it is hard to find a Hungarian who picks a U.S. for what 
their country should become. There is a great desire to avoid what in Hungary 
is viewed as American materialism, superficiality and extreme class divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling along the Vaci on New Year's Eve, my Magyar companion suddenly 
gushed, apparently for my benefit, that "America is coming." She was pointing 
at an Estee Lauder boutique up ahead. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, when I asked Koszeg the following day what Americans could best do 
to help promote democracy in Hungary, he cited the example of the American 
Civil Liberties Union. When the Communists recently unveiled their list of 
"crimes against the state" (read: dissent), the Hungarian opposition relied on 
an ACLU analysis of First Amendment objections to the Smith Act, a law designed 
to combat dissent in the United States, to fight the proposals. So armed, the 
democratic opposition beat back the Communists, securing significant advances 
for democracy and freedom of speech in Hungary. I didn't have the heart to tell 
Koszeg that George Bush was, in large measure, elected President by attacking 
the ACLU as un-American.

YEAR-ROUND SCHOOLS PLAN MAKES SPACE FOR TEACHING;

NEW CALENDAR WILL ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LEARNING. THE FEW DRAWBACKS ARE EASILY

The school year as we know it -- from September to June -- is a remnant of 
rural America, a time when children were needed in the summer months to help 
work in the fields. The Los Angeles of farms, ranches and orange groves is long 
gone, of course. In its place stands a sprawling metropolis with the 
second-largest school district in the country and an alarming shortage of 
classrooms and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding to put its schools on a year-round calendar, the Los Angeles school 
board selected the most cost-efficient, expedient and sensible way to relieve 
grossly overcrowded schools. Stop-gap measures -- such as busing inner-city and 
Eastside students great distances to less crowded schools -- provided an 
inconvenient, impractical and, above all, inequitable solution. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District has neither the land nor the money -- 
nor, for that matter, the time -- to build enough new classrooms to accommodate 
the district's projected growth of 15,000 students a year. Busing takes an 
unfair toll on the children who must spend hours shuttling between home and 
less crowded schools in unfamiliar neighborhoods. This routine would 
undoubtedly take its toll in the classroom, as well as during what should be 
peak homework hours. Children do not have limitless energy and cannot be 
compared to adults who commute by their own choice. 
</P>
<P>
The board's proposal to put all district schools on a multi-track calendar by 
the year 1991 will generate 60,000 extra seats without the expense and time 
constraints of additional construction. By moving to such a system, the 
district will be able to increase its capacity by a one-third without 
lengthening the school year. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, contrary to the claims of some critics, a year-round calendar will 
enhance the quality of education in public schools by diminishing the learning 
loss that tends to occur during extended summer vacations. The 30-day vacations 
will provide students with a more cohesive and continuous learning environment, 
in addition to greater opportunities for more frequent remediation when 
necessary. Intense concentration on subjects, with the proper guidance and 
lesson planning, will enable students to retain information as well, if not 
better, than during the traditional school year. Students in colleges and 
universities on a quarter system arguably learn as much as their counterparts 
in institutions on a more traditional and longer semester system. 
</P>
<P>
As with any solution, there are drawbacks to year-round schooling, but they are 
few and easily remedied. Critics who complain that students will be forced to 
attend school during the hot Los Angeles summer forget that temperatures often 
peak well within the already-established school year -- in September and 
October. And installing air conditioning is cheaper and faster than building 
additional facilities to house the relentless student influx. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most vocal critics of the proposal claim that the new school year 
will eliminate the possibility for family vacations, or at least make 
coordination of family-member schedules more difficult. To base education 
policy on vacation convenience is absurd. The proposal does not lengthen the 
school year, nor does it eliminate vacation times; it simply rearranges them. 
Thirty days of vacation will follow each 90-day school term. As for anxieties 
that the plan will disrupt family unity, district officials have vowed to make 
every effort to place children in any given family on the same track. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal -- in itself a flexible and creative way of addressing a serious 
problem -- provides students, parents and teachers with a wide range of 
hitherto unexplored options. Companies that have been creating summer jobs for 
students could create regular, year-round positions that would continually be 
filled by students from alternating tracks, bringing a greater sense of 
responsibility and continuity to the workplace. And teachers could elect to 
switch tracks when their particular track went on vacation, thus teaching full 
time, earning more and alleviating the teacher shortage. 
</P>
<P>
A decision to change what has been the accepted norm for decades takes courage 
to return to the primary mission of any school district: teaching children 
rather than scavenging for space. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has become a melting pot of immigrants. They come here in search of 
better conditions, a better climate, a better life. Many are underprivileged; 
many do not speak English; many cannot afford to educate themselves. The public 
school system holds out a promise of an education and a better life for their 
children. In a district as overcrowded as ours, where every day is a constant 
struggle for more space, only year-round schooling can keep that promise and 
allow our public schools to provide quality education for all.

<P>
My son, who is in the first grade, goes to McKinley Elementary School, located 
in the mid-city area of Santa Monica. There is an extraordinary and wonderful 
diversity at this school. 
</P>
<P>
This year's kindergarten class, for example, has 62 students, 38 of whom speak 
a language other than English at home. Fifteen of the children speak Spanish, 
and among the remaining 23 kids, 12 other languages are spoken. All together, 
there are kids from 45 nationalities in a school of 450 students, an ethnic 
flowering that does justice to the concept of Greater Los Angeles as a "world 
city." 
</P>
<P>
There is also a wide diversity in economic levels at McKinley. Though some 
families are homeowners or live in condos, most McKinley families tend to be at 
the lower end of Santa Monica's income scale. A number of the kids are homeless 
(about 3% of the school-age population this year, but as high as 10% last 
year). As many as 15% of the kids do not live in Santa Monica. Their families 
work in the city, and school board policy allows the children to attend Santa 
Monica schools. This policy is particularly relevant in the McKinley area, 
where there has been an explosion of commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
When I drop my son off in the morning, I love to walk through the schoolyard. 
There is a magnificent vibrancy, a special richness to how kids from such a 
variety of families interact and enjoy each other. 
</P>
<P>
The school has a number of teachers, several just launching their careers, who 
also seem to relish the challenges inherent in the situation. This year, my son 
is in a bilingual class that he loves, although in some ways "bilingual" is a 
euphemism. Ultimately, perhaps, McKinley is no different from other schools in 
that the kids are taught to read and write in English, do math and learn much 
of the standard state curriculum. The diversity is in the numbers and in the 
daily life of the school beyond what is formally taught. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this richness of opportunities, McKinley, like nearly all our public 
schools, confronts a range of serious problems. Per-pupil spending in 
California has declined dramatically, from $4,200 to less than $3,200, in this 
post-Proposition 13 era. That means more students per class, less equipment, 
less money for teacher salaries and and less money to upgrade facilities. Fund 
raising by McKinley parents averages about $25 to $50 per pupil, compared to a 
couple of the schools north of us, where wealthier parents have been able to 
raise as much as $1,250 per pupil. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley also has to contend with problems stemming from commercial 
development: more traffic, smog, noise and different land uses. Yet the Santa 
Monica City Council, which has been at the forefront in arranging developer 
agreements responsible for such community needs as additional low-income 
housing or on-site environmental innovations, has never included support for 
public schools, despite the fact that they are directly affected by these 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most disturbing is the contrast between the school population and the 
neighborhood population. Though Santa Monica has the undeserved reputation of 
being primarily a wealthy enclave (both the income levels and ethnic makeup of 
the entire city tend to reflect Los Angeles County averages), there are to be 
sure middle- and upper-class residents, including McKinley's neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of these residents do not have children, an increasing number do. 
Many of these children are being sent not to the McKinleys but to private 
schools. Though these schools pay lip service to "diversity" by offering a 
handful of scholarships, tuition cost alone (about $6,000) ensures a class and 
racial exclusivity. 
</P>
<P>
This two-tier public-private school division is at the heart of the dilemma for 
schools like McKinley. Private schools are a private solution, and their growth 
mirrors the erosion of citizen involvement throughout society. We have learned 
of the importance of taking responsibility from such issues as environmental 
degradation. So too, the schools have to become our public responsibility, from 
our individual choices to our actions at the community and statewide level. And 
as I walk through this schoolyard, listening to the excitement of the children, 
I wish their vibrancy could extend to our communities and to the larger 
society, where public engagement remains so elusive.

WILSON AWAITS BUSH'S WORD ON DRILLING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FUND-RAISER MAY BE THE FORUM THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO OFFER HIS WORDS 
ON A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT.

The politics of oil spills has reached the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
The oil slick that ate some prime Orange County beaches already has Gov. George 
Deukmejian and his wannabe successor, Sen. Pete Wilson, feuding over what to do 
about offshore drilling. The governor says a ban would be "shortsighted." The 
senator says drilling must stop. 
</P>
<P>
Enter President Bush on Feb. 28. In San Francisco to address a Wilson 
fund-raiser, the President may, sources say, use the occasion to make an 
announcement about the future of California offshore drilling. Earlier this 
year, he received a variety of drilling options from a presidential task force. 
</P>
<P>
At a Century City dinner held before the Orange County oil spill, the President 
called Wilson a "a great environmentalist." Key to the senator's reputation is 
his opposition to offshore drilling, but the President didn't explicitly 
comment on that. 
</P>
<P>
After the spill, Bush said he would not order a moratorium on offshore 
drilling, since the slick was the result of a tanker accident, not a 
malfunctioning oil rig. He added that the accident reinforced his view that in 
opening new offshore drilling sites, extreme care must taken to safeguard the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
All this complicates Wilson's gubernatorial ambitions. He knows that Sen. Alan 
Cranston in part owed his narrow victory over Rep. Ed Zschau in 1986 to a 
last-minute mailer to coastal swing voters that re-emphasized his opposition to 
drilling in sensitive areas. Those same voters, Wilson worries, may punish him 
if Bush calls for more offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater, who has said that winning the 
California governorship is his party's top priority this year, backs Wilson's 
anti-drilling views. He's also concerned that Bush's pro-oil sympathies might 
hurt Wilson's chances. 
</P>
<P>
But a state Republican strategist with longtime White House access says that 
Bush would only hurt himself if he calls for coastal-oil exploration and 
production now. The consultant recommended that the President ought to go for a 
moratorium and more study. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's budget proposal for fiscal '91 does contain some possible good news for 
Wilson. The Administration apparently will delay an oil-lease sale off the 
Central California coast until at least 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Feinstein, running slightly ahead of John Van de Kamp in the Democratic 
gubernatorial primary according to a new California Poll, has put together a 
grass-roots strategy she hopes will win her the nomination. Her manager, Darry 
Sragow, says that Assembly Speaker Willie Brown's endorsement of the former San 
Francisco mayor is the first step toward assembling a coalition of blacks, 
Latinos, Jews, Asians and women. Such a coalition is needed, Sragow believes, 
to offset Van de Kamp's expected support from Democratic special-interest 
elites, including organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti is also said to be edging toward 
Feinstein. His support, coupled with Brown's, would help Feinstein blunt the 
possible endorsement of Van de Kamp by the state Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Percy Pinkney, Feinstein's political director and a top black official, said 
the former mayor is attracting strong support in black communities throughout 
the state. Several mayors have endorsed her. And in the Latino community, 
Feinstein's grass-roots effort is headed by Assemblymen Charles Calderon 
(D-Montebello) and Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Although her TV ads have neutralized a disastrous early showing among male 
voters, Feinstein still is counting on women to respond positively to her quest 
to be the state's first woman governor. The California Poll showed her lead 
among Democratic women widening. 
</P>
<P>
An circulating initiative that would limit Los Angeles elected officials to two 
consecutive terms continues to roil City Hall politics. Should the measure 
qualify for the November ballot -- and few political observers doubt that it 
will -- virtually all current city officeholders would be out of a job when 
their term expired. One of them would be Joel Wachs, who would be unable to run 
again next year. So the only lawyer on the City Council is said to be eyeing 
the seat of City Atty. James Hahn, who, per the initiative, would be forced to 
seek another office in 1993.

GERMANY: IT'S NOT THE PREDISPOSITION OF A PEOPLE BUT THE QUEST OF A DICTATOR 
FOR TOTAL CONTROL THAT LEADS TO AGGRESSION AND WAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
The die is cast, the commitment made. Britain, France, the United States and 
the Soviet Union have agreed on the creation of a new Germany and to a process 
by which it will occur. Still, on the morning after, Europe is feeling 
ambivalent about the whole matter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Western governments long ago endorsed reunification of the two 
Germanys, and recent polls show that more West Europeans support than oppose 
reunification, misgivings abound as the reality looms. The Soviet Union remains 
the most outspoken of the four powers about its concerns. "Small boys, when 
they play soldiers here, still play Russians against Germans, not Russians 
against Americans," a Soviet political scientist said in explaining Soviet 
reluctance about German unity. 
</P>
<P>
Substantial minorities of adults in Poland, France, Britain and the Benelux 
countries, among others, share this reluctance to see the reconstruction of a 
powerful Germany in the heart of Europe. Poland has demanded a major role in 
the reunification process on the ground that previous suffering gives it a 
special interest. 
</P>
<P>
Germans are acutely aware of their neighbors' concerns. They have heard the bad 
jokes about how their neighbors like Germany so much they want two of them, 
about how the purpose of NATO is to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, 
and the Germans down. West Germans, in particular, have made repeated efforts 
to reassure their neighbors. They are still working on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We Germans are aware of the historical dimensions of (the reunification) 
process," West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev in Moscow. "We are aware of all the suffering inflicted on other 
nations in the name of Germany," he said. "We do not have territorial claims 
against any of our neighbors," he added, seeking especially to reassure Poland. 
But the fear remains. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because the United States never suffered physical destruction or defeat 
from the Germans, or perhaps because it is an ocean away, Americans are less 
worried than Europeans about a resurgent Germany, though they are sensitive to 
the power of the German economy. There is another reason why Americans do not 
worry as much. To be deeply concerned about "the German problem," you must 
believe that there is something inherent in the German people that predisposes 
them to expansion and aggression, and that this tendency is stronger than the 
experiences of war, defeat, occupation, division and 40 years of democratic 
politics. Americans have a habit of believing experience is more powerful than 
inheritance in shaping social behavior. 
</P>
<P>
I do not believe that there is a permanent predisposition to conquest in the 
German psyche. I do believe that there is a predisposition to aggression and 
war in totalitarian politics, and that this made the Germans of the Nazi period 
a special menace to Jews, Gypsies, Jehovah's Witnesses and all Germans who 
opposed Hitler's vision and commands. 
</P>
<P>
We know from the brief, violent history of Hitler's rule that the Nazis first 
made war on German society, then made war on the world. They moved quickly from 
the quest for total control within one country to the quest for control beyond 
its borders. The Nazi political machine was responsible for the deaths of tens 
of millions of people inside and outside Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It is right to fear the destructive dynamic that drives such politics. But it 
does not follow that we must fear Germans. Nor does the Soviet record prove we 
should forever fear Russians. Instead we should fear totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
Both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union adopted policies that involved huge 
bureaucracies and mass murders. To collect and ship Jews and operate the death 
camps of the Final Solution required the active participation of tens of 
thousands of Germans -- just as it required great bureaucracies of Soviet 
citizens to staff the secret police, the interrogations, prisons, executions 
and slave labor camps of Stalin's gulag. 
</P>
<P>
It does not follow, however, that the national character of Russians or Germans 
drove this destruction. It was rather the quest of dictators for total control. 
Totalitarian politics is dangerous because it strips individuals of rights and 
societies of protection and leaves them exposed to the state's claim of total 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of this century is not that Germans or Russians are intrinsically 
dangerous to the world, but that small bands of violent men who claim special 
powers over the rest of us should be restrained at all cost.

MAY BE GETTING THE DRUG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask any high school student where to get drugs, and chances are he or she will 
have a ready answer. According to a recent federal survey of 17,000 high school 
seniors, 58.7% of the participants -- an all-time high -- said that cocaine 
would be "fairly easy" or "very easy" to get, and more than 80% said the same 
about marijuana. Fortunately, it looks as if the increased availability is not 
translating into greater use. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the National Institute of Drug Abuse's annual survey concluded that 
drug use has dropped to the lowest level in 15 years. Only 35.4% of the survey 
participants admitted using drugs within the last year. Although that 
percentage -- roughly one out of three high school seniors -- is alarming, it 
is the lowest since the University of Michigan's Institute of Social Research 
began conducting the annual study in 1975. Ten years ago, twice as many high 
school seniors reported using illegal drugs regularly. This suggests that while 
the heavy emphasis on law enforcement and interdiction has failed to curb the 
supply of drugs, something is working to curb demand. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps drug education is playing an important role, because the survey also 
found an increase in the percentage of students who believe drugs can hurt 
them. Nearly 80% -- another survey high -- believe that smoking marijuana is 
harmful. Nearly 60% believe that trying cocaine even once or twice can harm 
them. The risk barometer indicates a healthier respect for the dangers of 
drugs. That's an important concession for young people, who often tend to 
believe they are invincible. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, not all the news in the survey is promising. Youngsters continue to use 
crack, the highly addictive form of smokable cocaine, at about the same rate as 
the previous year. Almost 1.5% of the high school seniors said they had used 
the dangerous street drug at least once during the preceding month, an 
indication of regular use. Nearly 5% said that they had tried it at least one 
time. What's scary about these numbers is that they indicate reasonably 
successful youngsters -- high school seniors -- are using a drug more commonly 
associated with hard-core dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Dropouts, a population at greater risk for drug use, are not surveyed, and drug 
use may be vastly underestimated without those figures. Even so, the national 
survey remains valuable because of the trends it helps identify. The apparent 
decline in use suggests that teen-agers are paying attention to the education 
programs and advertisements designed to alert them to the dangers of drug use. 
The lesson must not be lost on federal drug czar William Bennett, who appears 
to believe that tough law enforcement is the way to win the drug war. Maybe. 
But at least as much emphasis must be put on education.

WHEN SHOULD A COP SHOOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block reacted to a deputy's shooting and killing of a black 
Muslin in Los Angeles last month with the simplest of common sense. From now on 
officers will "avoid taking some enforcement action in minor incidents." 
</P>
<P>
That was a good starting point. But with the recent controversial shooting of 
an unarmed, nearly blind man by another sheriff's deputy, it may be time for 
Block and other local law enforcement officials to make sure they are doing all 
that they can to make sure officers as using their guns as carefully as they 
possibly can. 
</P>
<P>
Existing police guidelines stress that firearms be used only when absolutely 
necessary. They are reasonable, and in the case of the Los Angeles Police 
Department, laudably specific in emphasizing the training and reasoning behind 
its firearm policy. But no matter how well-wrought the guidelines may be, they 
can't possibly cover every situation an officer faces, from emotional family 
arguments to drive-by shootings. What law enforcement leaders can and must do 
is encourage what former cop James J. Fyfe calls a "corporate culture" that 
makes the use of deadly force at best a necessary evil in the career of an 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Fyfe, now a professor of justice at American University in Washington, says 
that unnecessary police violence rarely occurs because a cop is brutal. Most 
often it's because the officer is ill-trained in how to respond in a specific 
situation. Big city departments around the country offer similar training for 
their officers. Yet Fyfe's research reports that the rate of fatal shootings by 
police from 1975-83 showed a major difference between New York and Los Angeles 
police officers. The LAPD (the sheriff's department was not studied) was twice 
more likely to use deadly force than was the NYPD, even taking into account the 
larger number of NYPD officers. Fyfe admits that one variable that could cause 
such a noteworthy difference is the crime environment in a city, and that lies 
beyond the direct control of police administrators. 
</P>
<P>
But one controllable factor is organizational. When top police management 
embarks on a crusade to make the use of firearms a last resort, officers in the 
field soon get the message. Insistence on restraint can help avoid bloodshed in 
tense situations. Sure, law-enforcement officers have tough, rewarding and 
sometimes scary jobs. The sheriff and the police chief often remind a demanding 
public of the many hazards facing a police officer. But it is equally important 
for law- enforcement leaders, in word and deed, to remind officers of their 
singularly most crucial responsibility: restrained response.

SAVING TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The juxtaposition (Opinion, Feb. 11) of the two tree columns further 
complicates the dilemma well-meaning tree lovers are confronted with: to 
preserve or plan anew. 
</P>
<P>
We need both. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the stultifying effect of sugar coating tree planting in the 
urban scene is precisely the "mask" which hides the reality: Every mature and 
maturing tree removed from our urban blight accelerates our already seriously 
impacted air quality and exacerbates non-human water consumption. (Any young 
tree requires at least two years of monitored watering as contrasted to 
established trees which have generally adapted to rainfall only.) 
</P>
<P>
Let us not be deceived by the Arbor Day scenario that planting is better than 
protecting.

MOBIL EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times deserves full credit for its detailed and clear article (Feb. 11) on 
the cause of the explosion at Mobil's Torrance refinery on Nov. 24, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
My only complaint is that the article classifies this cause as "human error" 
when it is, as the article makes quite clear, managerial and corporate error. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a case of a careless or poorly trained employee turning the wrong 
valve, but rather the refinery management's indifference to malfunctioning 
warning devices and equipment. The extent to which this indifference may 
reflect Mobil's corporate policy is not clear from the article. The city of 
Torrance has every right to demand a higher standard of performance from Mobil.

</P>
<P>
SOUTH KOREA: TROOP CUTS, RATHER THAN BEING THE FALLOUT OF BUDGET NEEDS, SHOULD 
BE USED AS PART OF A CONSTRUCTIVE END GAME ON THE PENINSULA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY E. WIRTH, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) is a member of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee and recently returned from an official visit to South 
Korea. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pressure is on to reduce U.S. troop strength in South Korea, and Seoul 
should be prepared to fill the gap. That is the message Secretary of Defense 
Dick Cheney took with him to Korea last week. Rather than simply scaling back 
the U.S. presence as the South Koreans take on a greater role in their own 
defense, Washington and Seoul should advance the prospects for peace on the 
peninsula by linking U.S. troop cuts to improvements in North-South relations. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon agreed that reducing the 
43,000 American troops would be part of a broader restructuring of military 
relations in which Seoul will take on a greater share of defense 
responsibilities. The Bush Administration announced last month that three U.S. 
air bases in South Korea will be closed and 2,000 airmen withdrawn. Additional 
reductions of 3,000 personnel, now under review in the Pentagon, would return 
U.S. troop strength in Korea to the 1980 level. Budget pressures and concern 
over burden sharing may motivate Congress to seek deeper cuts. Last year, 
one-third of the Senate voted to withdraw 10,000 troops, and support for the 
plan is growing. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government and all three opposition parties are not anxious to 
see a reduction in the U.S. military presence at this time. Their concern is 
not military but political. U.S. troops constitute less than 5% of the South 
Korean armed forces and could, under the restructuring, be replaced by Korean 
firepower. The symbolic and deterrent role of U.S. forces cannot, however, be 
replaced by Koreans. Seoul fears that unilateral reductions would send the 
wrong signal to North Korea about the durability of our commitment to the 
South. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the historic changes in Eastern Europe, 1989 was not a 
"watershed year" in Northeast Asia. With more than 1.6 million troops facing 
each other across the 38th Parallel, the Korean peninsula remains an anomalous 
vestige of Cold War conflict. Nearly 1 million of those troops are under the 
control of the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung, one of the few Stalinist 
dictatorships to survive the 1980s. Yet the totalitarian North, whose 
propaganda has been aimed at the American presence in the South since 1953, 
cannot remain removed from world changes for long. The fall of the Berlin Wall 
and the prospect of German reunification have special significance in this 
nation divided by World War II. 
</P>
<P>
To promote positive change on the Korean peninsula in the 1990s, the United 
States and the Republic of Korea should forge a common policy that would use 
U.S. troop cuts as leverage to bring about improvements in North-South Korean 
relations. The increasing isolation of North Korea in the world community may 
provide an opportunity for progress in North-South talks, especially if we 
provide an appropriate face-saving vehicle as encouragement. The ultimate 
objective would be to withdraw all U.S. forces permanently stationed in South 
Korea, providing there is a marked reduction in military confrontation between 
the two Koreas, if not concrete steps toward reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of this policy would involve unilateral reductions in U.S. 
troops. The United States and South Korea should make a virtue of necessity by 
characterizing the joint decision to reduce the level of U.S. noncombatant 
forces stationed in Korea as a gesture of good will toward the North and to 
seek a reciprocal and positive North Korean response. Such an approach was 
taken by President Roh Tae Woo in his New Year's address when he stated that 
the scope of the annual U.S.-South Korean military exercise known as Team 
Spirit would be cut by 10%. So far, the North Korean response has been 
relatively encouraging. We should pursue a similar political approach to U.S. 
troop reductions this year. 
</P>
<P>
After this initial reduction, the second phase would tie further U.S. troop 
cuts to meaningful steps by the North to reduce tension and military 
confrontation. At a minimum, such measures would include North Korean 
acceptance of international inspections of the nuclear-enrichment facility 
under construction north of its capital, Pyongyang, as well as steps aimed at 
reducing the capability and fear of a surprise attack along the demilitarized 
zone. The heavy concentration of forwardly deployed North Korean troops -- as 
well as ammunition, fuel and bridging equipment -- along the DMZ is 
particularly threatening. Specific confidence-building measures to reduce that 
offensive threat and create greater warning time in which American forces could 
be reintroduced would provide an opportunity to further reduce our forces. 
</P>
<P>
Such a two-track framework by the U.S.-South Korean security alliance would 
establish a forward-looking policy toward the North. It would demonstrate a 
continuing U.S. security commitment to South Korea and underscore the political 
solidarity of our two governments in the pursuit of reduced tensions on the 
Korean peninsula. The alternative of budget-driven reductions or 
congressionally mandated withdrawals would do the opposite. There could be no 
better "end game" for America's postwar involvement in Korea than to facilitate 
improved North-South relations as we move toward withdrawal of our troops in 
the South.

MORE NOTES IN THIS TUNE THAN 'SO LONG, JUNE'; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CALIFORNIA CAN ADVANCE THE PRIMARY VOTING TO MARCH, BUT THAT DOESN'T 
MEAN THE STATE WILL NECESSARILY GAIN IN PRESIDENTIAL-SELECTION INFLUENCE.

<P>
Predicting the gains from moving California's primary from June to March is a 
lot like predicting who the party nominees will be. It is doubtful that all 
will go according to plan and that the predictions will prove accurate. It is 
also less than certain that the intended improvements will be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
If the goal is to give California its fair share of power, the way to achieve 
that is to exchange the current system for a national primary or a few regional 
primaries spread over a very short time. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing the state's primary date is inviting in theory. California has a 
unique and important perspective. Its demographics accurately reflect the 
nation's as a whole. Its voice should be heard with the decibels reflecting its 
population -- not more, not less. 
</P>
<P>
California, however, has in recent elections weighed in after the races have 
been decided, and the state's voters have justifiably felt that they have had 
no say in the process. 
</P>
<P>
But a June primary does not necessarily mean any dilution of California's 
power. Certainly a scenario could be conceived where the other states have 
essentially split their votes and the nominees are tied going into California, 
as in the 1972 Democratic primary. California would then get to cast the 
deciding votes, and voters here would feel that they had a greater role in the 
outcome. There are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, California is not necessarily buying itself additional power by 
advancing the date. Winning the nomination is a function of an infinite number 
of variables -- including, not necessarily in order of importance: money, the 
underlying quality of the candidates, the country's economic and political 
climate, strategy, the opinions of the media and fortuity. To assume that a 
change in timing will alter the outcome is to assume that these factors are 
immutable and unchanging. They are neither. 
</P>
<P>
What if, for example, California had committed the bulk of its delegates to 
Gary Hart in March, 1988, and the visit with Donna Rice had been revealed a 
week later? California perhaps would feel as if it hadplayed no role in the 
selection of the actual nominee. Not everything in politics goes according to 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit of moving up the California vote also depends on the strategies 
adopted by candidates and their consultants. Perhaps the best-financed will 
choose to skip New Hampshire and Iowa in order to avoid the possibility of an 
insurgent upset by a candidate short on money but long on committed volunteers. 
Or perhaps the candidate will skip California and focus on the "Super Tuesday" 
collection of primaries in the South -- particularly a Southern candidate. 
Changing the rules may just give candidates and campaign consultants a new 
backdrop for clever new strategies. 
</P>
<P>
All of this also assumes that the other primary and caucus states will remain 
where they are on the schedule. These states will not take kindly to 
California's effrontery. Efforts will be undertaken to win back that 
disproportionate power. Who knows where California may end up when the 
hopscotch is over. 
</P>
<P>
Pundits warn that it will hurt candidates with limited resources to face a 
state like California so early in the primary. Again, that is hard to predict. 
Remember, Iowa and New Hampshire still will precede California by only a month; 
as the first caucus and the first primary, they still will receive intense 
media scrutiny. The disproportionate power those states have will no doubt 
continue. Given the very close proximity of their contests and the free media 
exposure for the winners, the results in New Hampshire and Iowa may well spill 
over into California, amplifying the power of those two allegedly 
unrepresentative states. If a dark horse does well in Iowa and New Hampshire, 
he or she may get a "bump" and do well in California without spending much. 
</P>
<P>
California cannot be blamed for trying to increase its power by moving up. If 
the game is played this way, California has every right to try to grab as much 
power as it can. 
</P>
<P>
But the game should not be played this way. States should not be left with 
power and influence disproportionate to their populations. The problem is the 
manner in which the process takes place. When the primaries are spread over 
months and across the country, disproportionate power somewhere is possible -- 
if not inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid that, the best system is a single, national primary or, at the very 
least, a series of regional primaries. With a national primary, certain 
candidates still may be favored. But no state or region is either favored or 
foreclosed. The jockeying for position and power is avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Predicting the outcome of a California primary move may be difficult. But the 
evidence suggests that it will mean little in terms of increasing the state's 
influence and even less in terms of national fairness and true reform.

HE WASN'T A MAN FOR BACKSLAPPING, BUT HE WAS ADMIRABLY DOGGED AND TRUE; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON: OUR FIRST PRESIDENT HADN'T THE WIT AND FIRE OF JEFFERSON, AND EVEN 
FLUNKED ROMANCE. IT'S HIS PERSEVERANCE AND PROBITY WE LIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS V. DIBACCO, Thomas V. DiBacco is a historian at American University 
in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is difficult to get emotional about George Washington, especially in 
comparison with his 18th-Century contemporaries. Patrick Henry was a fiery 
Revolutionary leader ("Give me liberty or give me death."), John Adams a 
brilliant malcontent famous for his fidgety disposition, and Thomas Jefferson a 
learned patrician who espoused democratic views and was mired in gossipy 
controversies, including an alleged affair with a slave woman. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had none of these emotive qualities. He wasn't even chummy. There 
was the famous story of his wartime colleagues who, gathering in 1787, marveled 
at Washington's aloofness. One in the group wagered that he could back-slap 
Washington and bring down his icy reserve. But when he put his arm around his 
former leader, Washington removed it, stepped away and returned a cold stare 
that none in the group would ever forget. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike so many of his colleagues, Washington was not well-educated or even 
bookish. Military analysts -- in his time and now -- have suggested that he 
made mistakes on the battlefield. And he was scarcely noted for his amorous 
success -- his timidity with Sally Fairfax, his first passion, resulted in his 
having to wed a second choice, Martha Dandridge Custis. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, in contrast to Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, would not find fame 
abroad, for he never traveled to Europe. He ventured only once outside the 
United States, to go to Barbados with his brother Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Washington had some unattractive physical traits. His feet were 
enormous, and the Marquis de Lafayette, no parochial observer, said 
Washington's hands were "the largest I had ever seen on a human being." Another 
contemporary noted that Washington "is wide-shouldered but has not a deep or 
round chest; is neat-waisted, but is broad across the hips and has rather long 
legs and arms. . . . His mouth is large and generally firmly closed, but which 
from time to time discloses some defective teeth." 
</P>
<P>
Because Washington had his share of human failings, the historian finds all the 
more reason to honor him on the anniversary of his birth. For Washington also 
exemplified the qualities that have made this nation as great and as 
distinctive as it is. He was the American success story: a man with no 
particular distinction of birth or education who was intent on making it big. 
</P>
<P>
And make it he did, first as one of the great landowners of his era. He 
persevered in a manner that would upstage abler men and overwhelm his foes. His 
first entrance onto the military stage in the 1750s was unimpressive. No 
matter, he would try again. The British army whipped the dickens out of 
Washington's army time and again, but the general never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
Washington recognized the division of expertise among men, that some men did 
certain tasks better than others. Although had no great mind, Washington made 
the best of it. He was extraordinary as an administrator, especially as 
President. The matters of state were attended to, capable individuals were 
chosen to carry out policy, and the quest for solving the nation's problems was 
sobered by Washington's perception that ideal solutions might not be possible. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Washington recognized that as the nation's first President, his 
every action served to mold precedent and illuminate posterity. For these 
reasons, his conduct was reserved but unimpeachable. And he made certain that 
the presidency would not become monarchical in tone and that military leaders 
would not prevail over civil authority. 
</P>
<P>
"His integrity," wrote Jefferson, who often differed with Washington's 
policies, "was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known; no 
motives of interest or consanguinity, of friendship or hatred, being able to 
bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good 
and a great man."

BUSH IS CAUGHT IN A PENTAGON TIME WARP; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: AFTER THE 'REVOLUTION OF 1989,' IT MAKES NO SENSE TO PUSH FOR CUTS IN 
CONVENTIONAL ARMS WHILE BUILDING UP THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EUGENE J. CARROLL JR., Eugene J. Carroll Jr., a retired admiral, is deputy 
director of the Center for Defense Information in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a time warp in Washington. In his State of the Union Address, 
President Bush correctly described the world in 1990: The diminishing Soviet 
military threat allows for greater and faster conventional-force reductions in 
Europe. Then he reverted to the language and logic of 1983: "We must sustain 
our own strategic offense modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative." 
</P>
<P>
Today's nuclear balance does not justify this policy conflict. While the Soviet 
Union and the United States each have different nuclear arsenals, both 
countries are grotesquely overarmed. There are 13,000 U.S. strategic weapons 
aimed at the Soviet Union; there are nearly 11,000 Soviet missiles aimed at us. 
In any nuclear exchange, the war would be over, with both nations destroyed, 
long before all existing weapons were detonated. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, does President Bush call for a continued nuclear-arms race? A look 
at the proposed 1991 budget provides the answer. 
</P>
<P>
A listing of the new weapons systems under development or in production reveals 
that the Pentagon is still pursuing its strategic dream of nuclear superiority: 
five B-2 Stealth bombers; a Trident submarine (the 18th); 52 more Trident II 
missiles; 12 rail-mobile MX missiles; development of a new mobile Midgetman 
missile; a new aircraft-launched nuclear missile; 100 advanced air-launched 
cruise missiles and additional sea-launched cruise missiles; and a 23% increase 
in funding for the space-based missile defense program. Cost in 1991: $25 
billion to $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush justifies this enormous expense by citing the Soviet Union's 
continuing modernization of strategic forces. Actually, the Soviets are 
tailoring their nuclear forces to square with proposed limits in a future START 
agreement, as both Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and CIA Director William H. 
Webster have testified. By contrast, the U.S. program is turning out nuclear 
arms in excess of these limits. New American tactical systems included in the 
budget would create additional layers of unneeded nuclear-fighting 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an intensive research program involving an array of exotic "third 
generation" nuclear weapons is under way. X-ray and optical-frequency laser, 
hyper-velocity pellet and electro-magnetic-pulse weapons are being designed and 
developed. Maneuvering and earth-penetrating re-entry vehicles are also on the 
drawing boards. This research effort, unreported by the President, again 
signifies the Pentagon's quest for the kind of technological superiority that 
has fueled the nuclear-arms race for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
These new offensive and defensive weapons will require extensive nuclear 
testing before they can become operational. That's why the President has 
decided to defer further negotiations with the Soviet Union on test 
restrictions once current talks are completed. This will allow the United 
States to continue unlimited underground nuclear testing so long as the 
150-kiloton limit is not exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
There are political costs to this 1983 mind-set. The Administration's refusal 
to consider test restrictions that would prevent development of exotic nuclear 
weaponry is a violation of U.S. commitments in two arms-control treaties. In 
the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968, 
the United States pledged "to continue negotiations" leading to a cessation of 
nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
Is sustaining the 45-year-old nuclear-arms race the appropriate response to "a 
singular moment in history" (to use the President's words)? Beyond question, 
Mikhail Gorbachev and his country are on a far different course from that of 
even five years ago. To continue their new direction, they must lift the 
crushing economic burden of developing ever more nuclear weaponry. The Soviets 
temporarily halted nuclear testing in 1985 and are committed to stopping again 
when the United States does. They made major concessions to conclude an 
intermediate-range missile treaty in 1987; they are willing to do the same to 
get a START agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Unless President Bush begins to think in nuclear terms about the changes 
created by "the revolution of 1989," it appears that America will waste a 
priceless opportunity to reduce the dangers of nuclear war. It makes no sense 
to apply the logic of 1990 to conventional weapons while applying that of 1983 
to nuclear weapons.

CIVIL SUIT SEEKS TO BRING DOWN METZGER EMPIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Civil rights organizations have repeatedly failed to silence Tom Metzger, but a 
seldom-used legal tactic now threatens to financially ruin the white 
supremacist and bring down the organization he has been building for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The new tactic -- a civil lawsuit filed against Metzger; his son, John, and 
their national White Aryan Resistance empire -- relies on evidence that links 
the Fallbrook man to three skinheads who, in 1988, murdered a young black man 
in Portland, Ore., according to previously unpublished documents reviewed by 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
No one claims that Metzger wielded the bat that killed the victim of an 
apparently random racial attack, and no criminal charges are pending against 
him. But the suit seeks to hold the Metzgers responsible for the slaying 
because of their alleged role in organizing and encouraging the skinheads and 
to turn over their financial assets -- up to $10 million -- to the victim's 
family. No trial has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tom Metzger expresses nonchalance over the lawsuit, he is quietly 
liquidating assets. He no longer owns his house and is negotiating the sale of 
his television repair company. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, he claims to have lost thousands of dollars in work because of 
the lawsuit. He recently stood alone for two hours, invoking the Fifth 
Amendment during a legal deposition for the case. 
</P>
<P>
John Metzger, head of the Aryan Youth Movement, has filed for protection under 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in San Diego. He claims more than $2,000 in arrears 
and lists $10 million in potential losses from the civil case as a pending 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
The American Civil Liberties Union rejected a plea for legal assistance from 
the Metzgers. So they are defending themselves against allegations that their 
encouragement played a role in the murder of Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian 
immigrant living in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Key evidence shows that the Metzgers were deeply involved in Portland skinhead 
activities, sending organizers from California to teach young white recruits 
"how we work." 
</P>
<P>
Three former members of the Metzger organization, including the ex-vice 
president of the skinhead faction, are in hiding, apparently to ensure their 
safety until they can testify that the Metzgers dispatched them to Portland to 
spread racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the suit, Tom Metzger exuded self-confidence during a recent two-hour 
interview at his Fallbrook home, which is decorated with wall photographs and 
medals cataloguing his travels in the John Birch Society, the California 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and as a 1980 congressional candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"He ain't going to beat me," he said of Morris S. Dees, the Alabama civil 
rights attorney who is trying to make Metzger pay for Seraw's death. 
</P>
<P>
"He don't understand me. I'm a fanatic. It wouldn't make any difference if I 
did lose everything, because I wouldn't lose my fanaticism. And I would be back 
in business some way, three days after he got a victory." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, 51, said he is liquidating his assets in preparation for retirement. 
However, if he should lose the lawsuit, the move would give him fewer recorded 
assets to be awarded to the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
Dees has patterned the Metzger suit after one against the Ku Klux Klan in 
Alabama. In that case, he won a $7-million judgment against Klan members after 
the murder of a black teen-ager in Mobile. Dees successfully argued that the 
Klan, by encouraging violence and racism, helped bring about the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Klan branch did not have nearly that much money, the victim's 
mother was awarded a percentage of its leaders' future wages, a portion of 
their real estate and the deed to the group's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Dees declined to discuss the specifics of the Metzger case, saying only, "We 
intend to prove what we claim in our court papers." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in October, contends that the Metzgers "intentionally, 
wantonly and in utter disregard of their societal obligations" deprived Seraw 
of his civil right to life, and that $10 million in punitive damages would 
deter "future outrageous conduct of this kind." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger said the Klan lost because it did not fight hard enough, something he 
vows to do. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the Klan, and this is not Alabama," he said. "Morris Dees may be a 
big boy in Montgomery, Ala., but out here he ain't jack. 
</P>
<P>
"And, when I knock this guy out of the saddle, it'll make me the biggest thing 
in the country. I'm going to cost this guy so much money he's going to wish he 
never came out here. He's going to get bogged down like the Germans did in 
Russia. You've got another Stalingrad here." 
</P>
<P>
And, if Metzger loses? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no money," Metzger said. "I've got a '72 Chevy station wagon. Oh, and 
I've got a '79 Datsun truck that's rusting out in the back." 
</P>
<P>
Militant Leader 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Metzger is definitely a national figure," said Leonard Zeskind, research 
director for the Center for Democratic Renewal, which monitors cults, 
extremists and groups that espouse racial hatred. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the leader of the most militant wing of the neo-Nazis in the United 
States. He's attracted the new young blood out of the skinhead movement. He's 
attracted the most militant segments of the Klan factions. He's building 
alliances with the folks overseas in Europe who are similar-minded. 
</P>
<P>
"He shouldn't be taken lightly. People should regard Metzger as the most 
dangerous of the Klan and Nazi leaders." 
</P>
<P>
It is that leadership -- and specifically Metzger's alleged encouragement of 
racial violence -- that the lawsuit claims led members of a Portland skinhead 
group called East Side White Pride to kill Seraw. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Frink, the Multnomah County deputy district attorney who prosecuted the 
skinheads, said evidence from the criminal case demonstrates that Tom and John 
Metzger wielded control over the Portland group. 
</P>
<P>
"There is plenty of evidence that their general creed was to assault black 
people and Jewish people, and that the Metzger organization pressed this belief 
on East Side White Pride," Frink said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth M. Mieske, Kyle H. Brewster and Steven R. Strasser were young white 
recruits in the 20-member group, recently formed and newly active in 
distributing racist literature in Portland's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
In the early morning on Nov. 13, 1988, Seraw, 28, a driver for a rental-car 
company, and two black friends by chance encountered three members of East Side 
White Pride. Both groups had been drinking and, when they clashed on a 
southeast Portland street, Seraw was clobbered at least three times, suffering 
head-on blows from a wooden baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
The skinheads, rallied by their girlfriends' cries of "Kill him! Kill him!," 
fled into the night. Seraw died hours later at a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
After the killing, two other East Side White Pride members -- Dave Mazzella and 
Michael Barrett -- appeared on television to disavow skinhead involvement in 
the slaying. Police discovered outstanding California arrest warrants against 
Mazzella and Barrett, and brought them in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
During lengthy interrogations, the two California skinheads described in detail 
the life style of East Side White Pride, its organizational efforts and its 
members' desire to live the hatred preached by Metzger. 
</P>
<P>
They also named Mieske, Brewster and Strasser as the killers. The three 
eventually pleaded guilty in the killing and drew minimum prison terms of 9 to 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzella, then vice president of the Aryan Youth Movement, the official name of 
the national skinhead organization, served directly under John Metzger. Today, 
he, Barrett and Gagnon have left Portland and gone into hiding, Frink said. 
</P>
<P>
They have good reason. When Mieske was arrested, he said to police, "Snitches 
must die! . . . Whoever snitched us off is dead!" Frink said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Metzger acknowledged that the witnesses were once key members of his white 
supremacy network, and that he officiated at Mazzella's wedding. But he said 
the witnesses were expelled because of involvement with drugs. He said he no 
longer knows where they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave Mazzella went off the screen," Metzger said. "As they say in radar, he 
went off the screen." 
</P>
<P>
Skinhead Recruits 
</P>
<P>
Mazzella arrived in Portland in September, 1988, several skinheads told police, 
his task to recruit soldiers for the White Aryan Resistance. He was soon 
infusing East Side White Pride with new passions. 
</P>
<P>
He had a calling card, a handwritten letter from John Metzger to East Side 
White Pride, mailed one month before the murder and addressed to "Ken Death." 
That is the nickname for Mieske, the skinhead whose blows killed Seraw. 
</P>
<P>
"Wanted to drop a line and let you know we would like to open up communication 
with your group," the letter said. "You'll get a feel of how we work when you 
meet Dave Mazzella and Mike Gagnon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We have about a 700 list of supporters, members, etc., and we have 10 chapters 
around the U.S. We work with any pro-white, anti-drug white group as long as 
they do not talk." 
</P>
<P>
Mazzella did not disavow to police his allegiance to the Metzgers. He 
identified himself as "more or less their spokesman," a well-placed member of 
the palace guard for as many as three years, according to documents from the 
criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to the house a thousand times," he said of the Fallbrook Metzger 
residence, adding that he had talked to the Metzgers "probably about twice a 
week" since moving to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
He told detectives that Tom and John Metzger provided racist literature and 
White Aryan Resistance newspapers promoting violence and white power. 
</P>
<P>
"John sends it directly to me," Mazzella said. "They send me literature, then . 
. . I give stuff out to my people and my people distribute it." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's file contains literature that bears the Fallbrook address, 
portrays blacks as inferior human beings and fondly recalls Hitler and Nazi 
regalia. One bulletin, headlined "JEW DWARFS," pictures a microwave oven and 
the caption: "There is an oven in YOUR future!" 
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecutor's documents, Mazzella told police that his mission 
was to show the East Side White Pride what the Metzgers "teach about the 
skinhead way." 
</P>
<P>
"They were really sloppily organized," Frink said of the Portland group. "They 
had their heads on straight, and they were going the right way . . . but they 
were not what I'm used to, a tight-knit group, you know, real tight group 
(where they) sit down, everyone knows what to do, and they're real active." 
</P>
<P>
Police interviewed several female members of East Side White Pride who spoke 
reverently of the Metzgers. Deanna Johnson told detectives that the Metzgers 
contacted East Side White Pride members shortly after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"Deanna told Detective Neuenschwander that someone named Metsker (sic) had 
called her from California within the last couple of days and told her not to 
be afraid of the police, to cooperate," a police report said. 
</P>
<P>
"These people told her to tell the police what they need to know, and that the 
charges were phony, and when the truth came out the whole problem would go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
WAR Headquarters 
</P>
<P>
Tom Metzger points out that Charles Manson's followers rose to kill after 
hearing the Beatles' "White Album," but that John Lennon and Paul McCartney 
were never held accountable for murder. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Metzger says, his racist literature espouses change but "has nothing 
to do with going out and physically killing individual black people on the 
street corner." 
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the Portland murder as a mere street fight among drunks. Of the 
skinheads who pleaded guilty, he said, "We didn't even know those guys." 
</P>
<P>
"They all say I send people in to do these things. Baloney," he said. "If all 
that was true, I'd have been in prison a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
In his Fallbrook home, Metzger pulled several knives out of his pockets, placed 
them on a shelf, and settled into a worn chair. A White Aryan Resistance flag, 
skull and crossbones on a black field, hung on the wall. Law books lined a 
shelf. Out back sat the rusting cars, and the small trailer that houses his TV 
repair business. 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, John, 20, a computer operator at the San Onofre nuclear 
plant, came home. He walked swiftly past his father, declining to comment on 
the pending lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger is a small man. He is not gray yet; he is not tired. He believes in 
what he's doing, he said, even if it endangers his family. 
</P>
<P>
One recent night, an arrow from a high-powered bow shot through his front 
window, embedding itself in his living room wall, just 2 feet above his 
easy-chair. The chair was empty at the time, and Metzger is determined to find 
the attacker. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got our feelers out," he said. "You know, there's a regular way, and 
then there's the other way. You lay a little bread around, and you get some 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
From the ashes of his Klan alliances, Metzger has built his new WAR empire, 
preaching racial separatism from a street dominated by Latino families. "I was 
here first," he said. "It was all-white then." 
</P>
<P>
His newspaper goes to 30,000 readers, with circulation particularly high among 
prison inmates and the elderly, he said. He hopes to print a Russian-language 
edition. "We're pan-nationalists," he said. "After all, Caucasians are 
Caucasians." 
</P>
<P>
Although growing in number, skinheads represent only 10% of his followers, he 
said. "Most are businessmen and artisans." 
</P>
<P>
His telephone hot line, operating in 13 cities, receives about 650 calls a day. 
On a tape airing last week in Portland, Metzger rails against black gang 
violence in the city. He threatens to bus "darling Negro Crips and Bloods" from 
Southern California to foment racial aggression with the white majority there. 
</P>
<P>
"WAR has come to the decision that Portland needs even more cultural 
enrichment," he screams on the tape. "Boy! We're going to colorize Portland!" 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, much of Metzger's time is spent preparing a legal defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of these guys," he said of Dees. "He's got to kill me. That's 
the only way he's going to physically shut me down. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise," he's just creating a shrewder, more formidable enemy." 
</P>
<P>
In Portland, some blacks and whites agree that, if Metzger takes a fall, his 
legacy as a supremacist will march on. 
</P>
<P>
"It will flame an already volatile situation," said Sylvester Hendricks, a 
black radio talk show host in Portland. "His followers, if they haven't 
attempted violent acts before, will now. They will think he's been railroaded." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fleming, 19, a skinhead from Southern California who heads the United 
White Front in Portland, put it this way: "All hell will break loose. A lot of 
white folks will just go haywire."

REPENTANT IRA BOMBER REBUILDS LIFE AS MAN OF LETTERS IN COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

DUBLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shane Paul O'Doherty used to make letter bombs for the IRA. Today he is a 
student leader pursuing an English degree at Dublin's Trinity College. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote apologies to his maimed and mutilated victims, renounced violence and, 
after 15 years in jail, came out to start a new life. 
</P>
<P>
O'Doherty, now a frenetically energetic 34-year-old eagerly making up for lost 
time, joined the Irish Republican Army as an idealistic teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Swept away by a romantic idea of a guerrilla group manning the barricades to 
protect Northern Ireland's Catholic minority, he was steeped in the bloody 
history of Irish independence. 
</P>
<P>
The impressionable son of a middle-class Catholic schoolteacher in Londonderry, 
he left a letter for posterity under the floorboards of his room, pledging to 
be an IRA martyr ready to die for Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"I look back now with horror. I am now very wary of extreme chauvinism and 
patriotism," he said, his disillusionment with that cause total. 
</P>
<P>
"I am totally opposed to all violence," he said in an interview in Trinity's 
basement coffee room. "It horrifies me to look back at all those shattered 
bodies." 
</P>
<P>
After studying English in prison, he was accepted by Trinity, which was founded 
in Dublin in 1591. 
</P>
<P>
"To paramilitaries, I now argue on the productivity level -- we can look back 
on 20 years of violence and see that it has totally failed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is also a moral and philosophical argument. I do have basic Christian 
beliefs. I have been deeply influenced by Quaker doctrines but I do not like 
labels." 
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,000 people have died in the last 20 years in the IRA campaign to oust 
the British from Northern Ireland and in sectarian violence between Catholics 
and Protestants in the province. 
</P>
<P>
Once the articulate O'Doherty turned his back on violence, a string of British 
politicians and churchmen fought for years to gain an early release for a man 
given 30 life terms for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
His letter-bomb victims ranged from the late British Home Secretary Reginald 
Maudling to a brigadier, a judge and a secretary at the British Embassy in 
Washington, whose hand was blown off. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the only person in the history of the Northern Ireland conflict who ever 
wanted to apologize to his victims," said O'Doherty, a striking figure with 
curly red hair and beard. 
</P>
<P>
What did his victims think after O'Doherty was released last September and 
launched with enormous energy into his new university life? 
</P>
<P>
Derek Woodward, a former security officer at the Bank of England who lost an 
eye and a hand after opening one of the letter bombs, has not worked since 
being maimed. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so annoyed that Mr. O'Doherty comes out, goes to university and carries 
on a perfectly lovely life . . . but I have still got to serve my life 
sentence," was his reaction to the release. 
</P>
<P>
At Trinity, O'Doherty was elected unopposed to the student union as National 
Question Officer, whose responsibility is organizing meetings on political 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Getting people in the Irish Republic to care passionately about "The Troubles 
in the North" is an uphill climb, he said. "The North is a no-no. People just 
don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
O'Doherty, who also works as a free-lance journalist and is writing his 
autobiography, has staged a public debate between himself and Gusty Spence, a 
Protestant paramilitary leader who served 18 years for killing a Catholic 
barman. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to invite Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political 
wing, to talk at Trinity as well as Gordon Wilson, who touched the hearts of 
millions around the world when he prayed to forgive the IRA bombers who killed 
his daughter in the 1988 Enniskillen war memorial massacre. 
</P>
<P>
But does O'Doherty ever pause for thought or perhaps suffer a tinge of fear 
when opening his own mail nowadays? 
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that anyone in Ireland, north or south, is a potential target for 
violence," he said. "I am going to die anyway. If I am to die violently, at 
least I will have worked for peace."

CITY PLAN CALLS FOR RESIDENTIAL WATER-USE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diegans will face mandatory, restrictive schedules for watering their 
lawns, washing their cars and filling their swimming pools beginning in July, 
if the City Council adopts a $5.1-million water conservation program to be 
unveiled at Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-point conservation program, described by the city staff as "the 
broadest, most extensive set of long-range programs proposed by any water 
agency or district in the state," also recommends $100 rebates for installation 
of ultra-low-volume toilets, banning the hosing down of sidewalk and patio 
areas, and a three-year crash program to outfit all homes and apartments built 
before 1981 with water-saving plumbing devices. 
</P>
<P>
The multifaceted program is targeted at both household use of water and outside 
irrigation, which consumes 40% of the city's water supply, said Marsi Steirer, 
who developed the program for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What we were trying to do is satisfy the needs and the interests of the people 
of San Diego who are our customers" with a primarily voluntary program, Steirer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally scheduled to be unveiled March 7, the program is being brought 
before the City Council on Tuesday because of pressure from the Sierra Club, 
which will ask a federal judge Wednesday to build water conservation 
requirements into a proposed legal settlement that governs construction of the 
city's $2.8-billion secondary sewage treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club wants U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster to mandate measures 
that the organization claims could reduce sewage flows by 50 million gallons 
daily over the next eight years, allowing for a substantially smaller and 
less-costly sewage system than the one designed by city planners. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club believes that this could be accomplished by replacing every 
toilet in the 1.7-million-member Metropolitan Sewerage District with 
ultra-low-volume 1.6-gallon toilets. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys, and their counterparts from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, the U.S. Justice Department and the state Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, will argue that a legal settlement that governs treatment of 
waste is no place for water conservation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
City staffers also want city lawyers to propose adoption of the conservation 
programs in lieu of monetary fines that the city may have to pay the federal 
government for sewage spills into local waterways between 1983 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members have demanded to know how the city proposes to conserve 
water if it refuses to adopt the Sierra Club's demands. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is contained in a lengthy report that outlines 12 separate programs 
ranging from extensive public education and data collection to a mandatory 
odd-even schedule for watering lawns and washing cars. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, residents with even-numbered addresses could use potable water 
for outdoor purposes within certain hours on even-numbered days, and residents 
with odd-numbered addresses would be restricted to odd-numbered days, Steirer 
said. Washing sidewalks and paved areas, and operating ornamental fountains 
would be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
City staff is asking the council to adopt the program next month for 
implementation in July. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who has not decided whether she supports the 
concept, said that the program "is very likely to come this summer. I don't 
know that you have to do that all the time, but in San Diego, with our 
shortages" it may become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be as (residents') water and sewage bills go up, they may do it of 
their own accord, because it saves them money," McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
The staff also is recommending a pilot program to test the effectiveness of 
ultra-low-volume toilets and water-efficient testing devices, followed by a 
one-year program to retrofit 3,000 homes with 6,000 new 1.6-gallon toilets, 
which, under state law, will be mandatory in new construction beginning in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Toilets installed before 1981 use five to seven gallons per flush, while 
toilets installed since then use 3.5 gallons per flush, Steirer said. 
Replacement with a 1.6-gallon toilet would save a family of three living in a 
post-1981 home 48 gallons of water each day, or 17,250 gallons per year. 
</P>
<P>
But the program must first be tested to ensure that it works with older 
plumbing systems. "We know for sure that they work in new construction. There 
have been studies," Steirer said. 
</P>
<P>
But the city does not yet know whether the low-volume toilets provide 
"satisfactory transport of waste from the toilet through the sewer line," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another point of the plan proposes a $100 rebate for every retrofitted toilet, 
which would pay for a substantial portion of the estimated $160 to $220 cost of 
purchase and installation of each unit, Steirer said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebate program would add $1 million to next year's budget. Currently, there 
is no funding reserved for any of the water conservation programs. 
</P>
<P>
The most expensive proposal, at a cost of nearly $2.9 million over the next 14 
months, is a recommendation to outfit more than 100,000 pre-1981 single- and 
multifamily residences with water-saving shower heads, toilet dams and dye 
tablets that would reveal if water is leaking from toilet tanks into toilet 
bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The metal and rubber dams would displace 1 gallon of water from toilet tanks, 
and along with the shower heads and dye tablets could save the average 
household 20.2 gallons of water each day. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the first 50,000 homes would be given the devices during a 
10-week period this spring. 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors would follow up by touring neighborhoods to determine how many 
homes had posted a sign indicating use of the devices, Steirer said. 
</P>
<P>
A later telephone survey would gauge customer satisfaction with the devices, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District has agreed to pay $425,000 toward installation 
of the first 50,000 sets of devices. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been implemented by the cities of San Jose, Irvine and 
Pasadena.

NEW HOTELS HELP NATIONAL CITY FOOL THE CRITICS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National City, the South Bay community that marches to its own drummer, is 
proving the critics wrong -- again -- and giddy city leaders are pointing with 
pride to two new hotels that experts said would never prosper in the 
blue-collar town. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the recently opened Radisson Hotel stands alone, alongside Interstate 
5, its 10 floors looming on the horizon, a symbolic thumbing of National City's 
nose at the doomsayers. A 12-story hotel, as yet unnamed, is under construction 
across the way at 8th Street and National City Boulevard, in an area that many 
said could not support even one hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Two market researchers told us eight years ago that the market isn't there for 
one hotel at that corner. We thanked them for their opinions, paid them their 
fees, disregarded their recommendations and commissioned two hotels," said 
Arnold (Pete) Peterson, executive director of National City's redevelopment 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the $12-million Radisson has been open only three months, owners say 
it has succeeded beyond their most optimistic projections, and they predicted 
"breaking even" within the year. The Serj Corp., which owns the 180-room 
Radisson and 3.7 acres of redevelopment land around it, said it expects to 
finish the second, $18-million hotel with its 176 suites in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Gary London, director of the real estate division at the Price Waterhouse 
accounting firm, was one of the experts who recommended against building hotels 
on the site. In a recent interview, London said he was right when he made that 
recommendation, but added that he is glad National City officials disregarded 
his advice. 
</P>
<P>
"The past is not necessarily a prologue of the market in National City," London 
said. " . . . In redevelopment, timing is a very critical thing. Many people 
have had great ideas but no sense of timing. National City has always had an 
uncanny sense of timing." 
</P>
<P>
In this case, National City and the Radisson have profited from the San Diego 
Convention Center, which was not a reality when he did the study, London said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, who has guided National City's redevelopment for 15 years, said the 
city was taking a risk when it went against the experts' recommendations. City 
leaders were banking on the Convention Center being built someday and wanted to 
create a market for conventioneers who couldn't afford to stay in San Diego's 
high-priced hotels. 
</P>
<P>
London, who is also a redevelopment expert, marvels at National City's 
redevelopment successes, including its landmark Mile of Cars and the Plaza 
Bonita Shopping Center. The latter was also built despite warnings from some 
critics that the South Bay economy could not support another regional shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's reputation, whether real or not, is that it's middle-class at best, 
but probably lower-class," London said. "The truth is that National City is 
very progressive and a hidden jewel in the redevelopment area. . . . The city 
leaders' vision isn't very sophisticated, but, intuitively, it's very good. 
They always seem to know what does and doesn't work in their city." 
</P>
<P>
Serj Corp. President Jack Scull said current rates at the new Radisson are $55 
a night. Ironically, he said that when his company "decided to take a chance" 
and build the hotels, they were not counting on convention visitors. Instead, 
Scull said they were hoping to attract mainly clients from the Navy, the 
waterfront and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the two hotels are about 10 minutes away from the Convention 
Center and downtown San Diego were an added plus, he said. Of course, it helps 
that Radisson's parent company also owns one of the biggest travel agencies in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Serj has a Radisson franchise and contracted with the firm to manage and 
operate the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Radisson is the only hotel you can see between San Diego and the border. 
It sticks out as a 10-story building. We're not just sitting there hoping 
someone will come in. Our marketing strategy includes Nassco (National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding Co.), the Navy and Mexico. And it appears to be working," 
Scull said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to reveal the Radisson's occupancy rate. The hotel industry says 
new hotels need a daily occupancy rate of 65% or higher in order to survive. 
The San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau does not keep occupancy rates by 
individual cities, but it put the December rate at 53.5% for the South Bay, 
including National City. 
</P>
<P>
National City community activist Ron Morrison said he is "not necessarily a 
critic of the Radisson." Nevertheless, he said several residents are concerned 
because there are days when "you only find 10 or 20 cars in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
"If there is concern, it's because the city gave a real sweet deal to Serj when 
they sold them the property. We don't want anything to go wrong after the city 
unloaded the property at a very cheap price," Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
National City Councilman Fred Pruitt said the council has not been given 
occupancy figures for the Radisson. However, Pruitt acknowledged that there are 
days when the Radisson does not appear to have much business. 
</P>
<P>
"We're told that everything is going fine. There have been some Saturday nights 
when I've driven by the hotel and only half or fewer of the room lights are on. 
I don't know if that means anything. But I also know of several occasions when 
the hotel was full," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scull acknowledged that his company got a good deal on the 3.7 acres that are 
undergoing redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Peterson, the city paid $7 million to purchase the land and 
businesses in the redevelopment area. The city then turned around and sold the 
property to Serj for $8 a square foot, or $1.3 million for the 3.7 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Such a transaction is not unusual in redevelopment projects. Cities frequently 
sell developers property at below-market value as an incentive to get them to 
build in high-risk areas. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good price for us, and we needed an incentive to get us there," 
Scull said. "We were taking a risk in the area, but, as it turned out, it's 
been very positive. Our marketing study said it could be a good market, and 
that's been verified. The project needed to be something good for National 
City, but it also had to be economically viable for us." 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment plan for the area, which is called the Four Corners Project, 
calls for building to occur in three phases. The hotel now under construction 
is Phase 2. The final phase, which is expected to be completed by December, 
1991, will feature a bank and several retail shops. 
</P>
<P>
According to city projections, the project will generate more than $915,000 in 
room taxes from 1990 to 1995, and up to $150,000 in property taxes during the 
same period. After 1996, the city expects to get about $375,000 annually in 
room and property taxes from the project.

A NOWHERE ROAD FOR $40 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: FUNDS FOR THE PLANNED EXTENSION OF JACKSON DRIVE WOULD BE 
BETTER SPENT ON NEEDED ROAD REPAIRS IN NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH WAS THE INTENTION 
OF PROPOSITION A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY D. SUTTLE, Gary D. Suttle lives in Allied Gardens. He and his family 
enjoy frequent outings at Mission Trails. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago, San Diego taxpayers dug deeper into their pockets to fund a 
half-cent sales tax for needed transportation improvements. Now a substantial 
portion of those funds are being siphoned into an unrequired, costly, 
park-disfiguring road called the Jackson Drive extension; and most citizens 
know next to nothing about it. 
</P>
<P>
How could they? The extension has been little publicized, and it was not 
included on the 1987 Proposition A ballot list of major road projects to be 
funded. Instead, the road was inserted by San Diego City Councilwoman Judy 
McCarty and a developer-backed lobby, with the assent of local community 
councils who were told it would reduce traffic on their residential streets and 
provide a convenient link to the future extension of California 52. California 
52, now in the final planning stages, will extend eastward from Tierrasanta to 
Santee, where it will connect with future California 125, running from Santee 
south to Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
The completion of Californias 52 and 125 are vital additions to the regional 
road system, and will help relieve overcrowded arteries in the Allied Gardens, 
Del Cerro and San Carlos areas. But a recent study by the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments concluded that the proposed Jackson Drive extension was not 
essential and would divert "very few trips from the surrounding street 
network." 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the extension could increase traffic congestion, noise and air 
pollution in the San Carlos area (where it would tie in to the existing Jackson 
Drive), by inducing motorists to cut through the community on their way to and 
from La Mesa, Grossmont Center and points east. 
</P>
<P>
Citing traffic and safety concerns, the adjacent community of Tierrasanta 
recently persuaded the City Council to scotch a planned connection between 
Clairemont Mesa Boulevard and the proposed extension. This connection was 
considered a major benefit of the project. Its deletion makes the benefit/cost 
ratio for the Jackson Drive extension even worse. And with benefits so paltry, 
what are the costs? Astronomical. 
</P>
<P>
The latest estimate for the road is $40 million and rising. This figure does 
not include more than $6 million required for the interchange with California 
52, nor the money that the city has already poured into studies. These millions 
of dollars could be much better spent in neighborhoods throughout the city on 
necessary street improvements such as resurfacing, road widening, pothole 
repair and new traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, that's how the city's local Proposition A funds were meant to be used. 
Instead, over the next five years, the single road extension of less than 3 
miles would devour at least one-third of the entire local allotment of funds, 
thus delaying dozens of important projects. In an era when the City Council is 
grappling with ever-shrinking budgets and ever-growing demands for municipal 
services, and when calls for further tax hikes fill the air, spending this kind 
of money to build an unnecessary road for the convenience of relatively few 
people surely is unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the extension's impracticality and costliness lie critical environmental 
concerns. The road would cut a wide swath across the west side of Mission 
Trails Regional Park, one of the last sizable expanses of open space in urban 
San Diego County and one of the largest urban parks in the United States. Its 
5,700 acres serve as a sanctuary for all San Diegans who seek to escape the 
commotion, crowds and pollution of the city -- a large lake, steep mountains, 
canyons, wildlife and wildflowers abound. 
</P>
<P>
I love to walk from the current dead end of Jackson Drive, down along a dirt 
road into the heart of Mission Gorge, boulder hop across the usually shallow 
San Diego River and then head up a short, steep trail to a lovely secluded 
valley north of the gorge. Here, the configuration of the surrounding uplands 
blocks out the sights and sounds of civilization. It's like being in a time 
warp, back 300 years, to an age when Indians ground acorns under the live oak 
trees (rock mortars in the valley reveal their earlier presence). Red-tailed 
hawks soar silently overhead, and the only sounds heard are the murmuring 
creek, birdsong and the soothing rustle of tree leaves in the breeze. This 
stillness would be shattered by the Jackson Drive extension. 
</P>
<P>
It's taken years, and millions of dollars, to acquire this precious open space. 
In the latest acquisition, $8.2 million was spent to add 620 acres to the 
northwest corner of the park. Unfortunately, this land lies directly in the 
path of the proposed four-lane extension with a design speed of 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Is this how taxpayers envisioned their dearly given open space funds would be 
used? 
</P>
<P>
An exorbitantly expensive bridge would be required to span the San Diego River 
and sheer slopes of the gorge. Its construction would disturb scarce riparian 
habitat, where the endangered least Bell's vireo and unnumbered other species 
reside. The bridge would act as a monumental sundial, casting a gloomy shadow 
over the gorge throughout the day. Without question, the bridge would despoil 
the beautiful natural character of the gorge and its current sunbright 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Past the bridge, the extension would segment an area of the park that serves as 
an important preserve for many species whose habitats have been destroyed by 
development in surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Each spring, for instance, there is a kaleidoscopic array of chocolate lilies, 
purple shooting stars, pink wild sweet peas, yellow pansies, blue-eyed grass 
and many other species. The extension would bulldoze much of this wildflower 
display into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
And it would hasten the decline of such wild creatures as the coyote and deer, 
and chances to view them. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman McCarty has been a strong supporter of Mission Trails park, but on 
the extension issue she appears to be wearing blinders. She maintains that 
Jackson Drive will enhance people's ability "to appreciate the natural 
wilderness and to escape urban pressures." 
</P>
<P>
How can a major roadway slicing through dedicated parkland do anything but 
corrode the "wilderness" experience? In fact, the extension epitomizes "urban 
pressures" and injects the very elements (rapid vehicles, noise, exhaust fumes 
and so forth) that people go to a park to get away from. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentally sound alternatives can provide access to the west side of the 
park. Dirt roads and Jeep trails crisscross portions of the area. Upgrading 
several of these roads -- which follow the contours of the land rather than 
superimposing themselves on it, as would the large, linear extension -- can 
afford ready access at a fraction of the cost of Jackson Drive. A staging area 
on the west mesa with shuttle service to remote reaches of the park is another 
possibility. In these ways, individuals and families who prefer to drive rather 
than hike can commune with nature, picnic, camp and savor a remnant of wildness 
only minutes from the heart of the nation's sixth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council should remove the Jackson Drive extension from the master plan 
as it did the Clairemont Mesa Boulevard connection. The extension would be, by 
far, the single most destructive occurrence in the history of Mission Trails 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not spend upwards of $40 million for hardly 3 miles of nonessential 
roadway, that would simply save a few minutes of commute time. Let's spend the 
money on much-needed road projects in every part of the city and save an 
invaluable piece of natural open space parkland for all time.

REFLECTIONS: 'ABOUT THE SAME TIME I WAS INTERESTED IN DINOSAURS, I WAS ALSO 
READING COMIC BOOKS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kensington resident George Olshevsky, 43, has degrees in mathematics and 
computer science. But his lifelong loves have been comics and dinosaurs. Born 
in Germany and raised in Buffalo, N.Y., Olshevsky moved to California because 
he likes being able to ride his motorcycle year-round. His next project is 
producing a series of dinosaur books for a firm that builds life-size dinosaurs 
for museum shows. Olshevsky was interviewed by Times staff writer G. Jeanette 
Avent and photographed by Teresa Tamura. 
</P>
<P>
I have no idea why I'm interested in dinosaurs, except they are fascinating 
animals, and they fit in with my sense of collecting things, such as all the 
comic books in a set, all the stamps in a country. 
</P>
<P>
At first, though, dinosaurs were sort of a peripheral thing, something I was 
interested in marginally. For a very long time, I just didn't have the time to 
pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
I majored in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 
Cambridge. I got a master's degree in computer science from the University of 
Toronto and worked as a computer programmer there. 
</P>
<P>
But comic books pulled me away. About the same time I was interested in 
dinosaurs, I was also reading comic books. Dinosaurs happen to be featured 
quite frequently in comic books because they're so awesome. 
</P>
<P>
Usually in comic books, they make them six times as big as they ever were, and 
show them knocking down houses and large multistory buildings and eating tanks. 
</P>
<P>
When I was at MIT, people would bring in these new comics which had sprung up. 
Marvel Comics was publishing Spiderman and the Fantastic Four, and they were 
much better than any of the other comics being published at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Marvel Comics all dealt with the same universe. What happened in one comic, say 
the Fantastic Four, could easily affect what happens in Spider Man. Finally, I 
decided I had to amass the whole set. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, I was able to build up a complete collection of Marvel comics from 
the very first issue of the Fantastic Four in November, 1961. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, I bought every single issue off the stands for a period of 
20 years. I recently sold the first issue of the Fantastic Four for $400. A 
mint copy is worth about $2,500 these days. 
</P>
<P>
Being a computer programmer, one of the things I did was put together a list of 
the comic books I still needed for my collection. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, there were about 300 to 400 books I had to pick up. My final 
list was 666 pages long, and it listed all the Marvel Comics from Fantastic 
Four No. 1 through comics dated April, 1975. I had the issue number, the date, 
the subject of the cover, the cover artist, who wrote the story, who drew the 
story, who inked the story, who lettered the story, who colored the story, and 
who all the characters were. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred to me this would be a good thing to publish for Marvel fans and do 
it the ultimate way: put a photograph of each cover next to its listing. 
</P>
<P>
I had become friends with a comic collector in Toronto and we published the 
indexes from 1975 to 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Marvel produced more comics than we could ever index after a while. So what we 
did was index Spiderman, Conan the Barbarian, the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, 
and Thor. There were still more to be indexed, but things happened. 
</P>
<P>
During the early 1980s, Marvel called me up and asked me if I was interested in 
producing a set like that for Marvel, which Marvel would sell and distribute. 
</P>
<P>
I thought this was a great idea. But, after I had finished in 1987, I was 
totally burned out. At that point, since I had decided not to have anything 
more to do with comic books, I put my entire collection up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
When I finished working for Marvel, I decided, since I had worked so long in 
comic books, maybe I could do something with dinosaurs. So I created a dinosaur 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
When I was at the University of Toronto, the other thing I indexed were 
dinosaurs because I wanted to keep track of all the dinosaurs and how they were 
classified. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, collecting information on dinosaurs is a lot harder than 
collecting comic books. Dinosaur papers are published by scientists working 
around the world, and sometimes they're published in the most obscure, 
outrageous journals. 
</P>
<P>
When I finished working on the Marvel indexes, I designed a newsletter on 
dinosaurs called Archosaurian Articulations and I published the first issue. 
After that, I was avalanched with dinosaur work. 
</P>
<P>
I also want to do some dinosaur books of my own. I have a lot of ideas about 
dinosaur evolution and anatomy that I would like to publish to have them out 
there so people can see them, debate them, and correct them if necessary. And, 
of course, I have the newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
I'm just trying to go slow so I won't burn out.

HOMEOWNERS ARE READY FOR SOME STABILITY; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: ELEVEN YEARS AFTER THE HILL BENEATH AN OCEANSIDE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY 
BEGAN SLIPPING, REPAIRS BEGIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Martin and Wilhelmina Eichman moved to Oceanside in 1977 to escape the smog and 
traffic of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get back to God's country, as it were," Martin Eichman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eichman, now 72, had just retired after 16 years at IBM, and he and his wife 
were attracted to Oceanside Manor, a senior citizens housing tract, because of 
the peaceful neighborhood and accommodations for people their age. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they moved in, their retirement dream home cracked, the result of 
movement of the unstable hill it was built on. 
</P>
<P>
The Eichmans live in one of at least 55 homes that have been damaged in the 
233-unit seniors community along Lake Boulevard in Oceanside. The houses were 
built between 1973 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 11 years after the cracking in their home began, the couple, along with 
other homeowners in Oceanside Manor, are getting repairs, and a little peace of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
In the Eichman house, a crack three-eighths of an inch wide developed along the 
floor, running from the front door through the living room and dining room to 
the other side of the house. Cracks in the stucco also developed along window 
sills and door frames because of the shifting, said Eichman, a retired engineer 
and Marine Corps officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't here much more than a year and there started to be damage to the 
hillsides," he said, referring to land movement under the houses. "And not much 
after that, the homes were affected, with the slabs and walls starting to show 
heavy cracking." 
</P>
<P>
A series of lawsuits began in 1979, filed by at least 60 residents of Oceanside 
Manor against the joint developers, Harry Summers Inc. and Hermosa Homes; a 
soils engineering firm, Woodward-Clyde Consultants and insurance companies that 
wrote policies on the homes but refused to pay, saying that type of damage was 
not covered. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, it was a fairly noteworthy and substantial case," said Bradley 
Hallen, an attorney for the Oceanside Manor Homeowners Assn. "Since that time, 
there have been a number of extremely large settlements and awards." 
</P>
<P>
"For most of our history in San Diego County, the developers have built on 
fairly good ground," Hallen said. "It was only after all the good parcels were 
built up did they start to build on marginal areas." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted more litigation because of the increased development of North 
County. Many of the Oceanside Manor lawsuits were filed after nine homes in the 
area were torn down in 1982 and part of the hillside was removed to alleviate 
the pressure causing the sliding. The developers claimed that the slope was 
repaired sufficiently, and every side had an expert to back its claim. 
</P>
<P>
"We had probably as many opinions as there are experts in the field," said Stan 
Smith, an attorney for Harry Summers Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the suits were settled in January, 1987, when the developers and 
consultants agreed to a $10-million settlement with the homeowners association 
and individual homeowners. Most of the money was earmarked to stabilize the 
hillside and repair the homes. 
</P>
<P>
Later, disputes with three insurance companies were settled separately for a 
total of $10.5 million, Hallen said. The money went to the homeowners 
association, also for repair work. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after three years of stabilizing work on the hillside, work on the homes 
is scheduled to begin in late March. No one is sure how long the process will 
take, but residents say they are pleased to see the light at the end of the 
tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a traumatic period for most people, particularly for those on the 
landslide," said Ann Boltz, 72, whose house was damaged by ground water that 
seeped through her floor. "One of the geologists said to me, 'You were sitting 
on a pool of water.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Seemingly now, though, the worst is behind us," said Boltz, who chaired the 
homeowners group during part of the litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We've waited 11 years for the repairs, and it's been a long, long wait," said 
Eichman. "We had to do it the hard way. If we hadn't had access to considerable 
funds through (our individual) insurance, we wouldn't have been able to pursue 
the legal efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Although housing prices in the tract plummeted, Eichman is optimistic that the 
value of his house will rise after the repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"This property is probably the best investigated and documented property in all 
of Southern California," he said. "Our stability here will be unquestioned." 
</P>
<P>
Eichman said that several years ago, when he and his wife were unsure whether 
they would win a settlement or not, they went shopping in North County for a 
new house. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a single place that we found that met our needs like this place 
did," Eichman said. "Now that the repairs are going to be done, we're going to 
stay here forever and ever, amen."

'MUD DUCKS' WIN ROUND IN FIGHT FOR ANCHORAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego appeals court on Friday threw out the convictions of nine boat 
owners found guilty of anchoring illegally in San Diego Bay -- a victory for 
the Mud Ducks of Emory Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The motley collection of houseboats has been anchored in the snug harbor -- 
within sight of the affluent Coronado Cays residential marina -- for years, 
long before the San Diego Unified Port District rescinded the right to free 
anchorage anywhere in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The action by a Superior Court appeals panel was based on the failure of a 
South Bay municipal judge to allow the boaters to videotape testimony of an 
expert witness for presentation at their trial a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Graf, one of the live-aboards who is fighting the Port District to retain 
free anchorage in Emory Cove, said the boaters "are flying high" after the 
victory, which she conceded may be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jennifer Yackle asked the panel for a written copy of its 
decision in anticipation of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Emory Cove contingent, many of whom have called the Silver Strand anchorage 
home for more than a decade, are fighting Port District attempts to move them 
from the protected cove to an unsheltered anchorage in mid-bay. 
</P>
<P>
The only legal anchorage designated by the Port District in the southern half 
of San Diego Bay lies off the mouth of the Sweetwater River, next to a ship 
lane used by commercial and Navy vessels. Emory Cove residents say that the 
open waters and wash from passing ships would wreck their aging houseboats if 
they were forced to move there. 
</P>
<P>
Port District commissioners passed an ordinance restricting anchorage in the 
southern part of the bay in l987 and issued eviction orders to the live-aboards 
and other craft in the southern bay. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Shaw, attorney for a majority of the Emory Cove contingent, said that the 
group also is fighting a Port District effort to dredge a parking lot used by 
the Emory Cove boaters in an effort to force them to move and is challenging 
the legality of the Port District ordinance regulating anchorage areas and 
speed limits in the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw praised Graf and her husband, Lawrence, who live aboard a converted 
minesweeper anchored in Emory Cove, as "the only ones who have had the guts to 
challenge the Port District" on the new bay regulations.

BERGESON'S STANCE ON ABORTION RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the article (I can't believe I just wrote that) about Marian 
Bergeson ("Bergeson Stands Tough on Abortion," Feb. 8). It is nice to know that 
at least one candidate running for state office has genuine conviction, 
integrity and veracity. 
</P>
<P>
She is not going to do the flip-flop on the abortion issue like so many other 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
I believe the real reason so-called "pro-life" candidates have lost in some 
major races is because they have wavered or been weak on the issue; therefore, 
the pro-life constituency wasn't enthusiastic about supporting or even voting 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has pointed out -- more than once -- that Bergeson and John Seymour 
(her opponent in the Republican primary for lieutenant governor) are very 
similar in most aspects other than abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Even if I were for abortion, I'm not sure I'd vote for Seymour. It's obvious he 
switched positions for pro-choice votes. How can you trust a man like that? 
Will he alter his views on other issues for the sole purpose of winning votes? 
(Can you imagine him and Sen. Pete Wilson running California? The two do more 
flip-flops than a fish out of water!)

POLITICAL CAMPAIGN COSTS AND FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How much is an election worth? Apparently quite a bit, since Orange County 
Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder has already raised $159,000 for her 1990 
reelection campaign. By the time the campaign is over, much more will probably 
be spent by the wealthy landowners, builders and developers who wish to see 
Wieder remain in office in order to preserve their political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In a county that has real problems housing the homeless, feeding the hungry, 
coping with drug abuse, building affordable housing, providing health care, 
educating the young and caring for the elderly, expenditures of this magnitude 
on political campaigns seem nothing less than obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Spending in local, state and national campaigns has skyrocketed in the past 10 
years. In 1986 the average incumbent running for reelection in the House spent 
over $330,000 and in the Senate spent over $3 million. In 1984 the average seat 
in the California State Assembly cost $384,000. 
</P>
<P>
These expenditures are excessive in their own right. Indeed, along with 
Wieder's war chest, they are an embarrassment to our priorities as a society. 
More importantly, they make it all but impossible for the average citizen to 
run for office. Elections no longer tell us who is the best candidate. Rather, 
they reveal who has been the best fund raiser. That's a pitiful excuse for 
representative government. 
</P>
<P>
The time for national and state campaign financing and expenditure legislation 
is long overdue. Of course, it's not much of a surprise that well-entrenched 
incumbents have little incentive to regulate the very means they utilize to 
stay in power. As a result, it's time for the citizens of this state to 
reassert control over the costs and financing of political campaigns. We can do 
so by utilizing the initiative process and by sending a message to current 
officeholders that excess in the realm of campaign expenditures is not a 
virtue.

ORANGE COUNTY'S WORST OIL SPILL SHOULD BECOME A LEARNING SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT F. GENTRY, Robert F. Gentry is a city councilman and former mayor of 
Laguna Beach. He serves on the executive committee of the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments and the governor's Local Government Advisory Committee on 
Offshore Development. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feb. 7, 1990, will be a day that Orange Countians will remember for some time 
to come. On that day, approximately 400,000 gallons of oil began spewing from 
the American Trader, an 800-foot tanker operated by British Petroleum. The 
disaster is the worst oil spill in the history of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was the direct result of a single-hulled tanker being damaged by its 
own anchor as it was moored off Huntington Beach, ready to deposit its oil in 
the underground pipe system serving the oil industry of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The first incredible response to that situation should be: "Why are we allowing 
single-hulled tankers to be transporting crude oil so close to shore in an area 
where shipping traffic is very heavy and recreation and tourism are extremely 
important?" 
</P>
<P>
Had that tanker been double-hulled, the spill probably would not have happened. 
However, the oil industry and its very powerful lobbyists in Washington have 
been successful in their efforts opposing double-hulled ships, thus allowing 
the continued operation of these somewhat fragile single-hulled vessels in 
near-shore waters at the risk of the shoreline and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
We are fortunate that mother nature looked favorably upon us, playing a very 
important role in the clean-up operation. The extremely positive weather 
conditions saved the Orange County coast from a much worse disaster. Had we 
been in the throes of winter storms, that oil could have devastated the entire 
Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
What have we learned from the clean-up operation? That there are just a few 
ways to remove the oil from the surface of the ocean. It can be burned away. It 
can be skimmed from the top. It can be laden with chemicals to disperse it and 
it can be sopped up with certain types of absorbent materials. 
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that Orange County's air quality is some of the worst in the 
nation, we would not want to burn off the oil at the risk of increasing Orange 
County's smog. The chemical dispersal also creates some very serious hazards to 
the environment and the food chain that render it inadvisable. 
</P>
<P>
Skimming the oil off the water seemed to be the best way to recover the oil. 
However, it is very slow, laborious and not extremely efficient. That process 
also does not work well with "thin" oil or in extremely shallow water. Many of 
the methods of absorbing the oil still are experimental and have not been fully 
tested, so we are not aware of all the pros and cons. 
</P>
<P>
It is amazing that in 1990, with the kind of technology this country has 
utilized in many areas, we still have these quite primitive ways of recovering 
oil from the water. We cannot work at night, all cleanup methods are 
ineffective in rough seas and most methods are extremely labor-intensive. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the technology has not been developed to handle a spill even 
the size of this one, and that, to me, is deplorable. We should not be offering 
the leasing of tracts off Orange County when we are unable to effectively clean 
up from a disaster that oil development and the oil industry may produce. 
</P>
<P>
We have also learned that the process of handling the disaster needs a lot more 
coordination. Federal, state and local government agencies need to come 
together to preplan for such a disaster. We need a communications network with 
a centralized disaster headquarters for local agencies to pool their resources, 
obtain information, handle questions and concerns, and make effective decisions 
in terms of cleanup operations. 
</P>
<P>
We need to view this situation much like a civil defense emergency. It seems as 
though we have not done so. There are various agencies involved in the cleanup 
operation, each having its own specific responsibility and authority. Local 
government resources have been available, but in many cases not utilized to the 
fullest extent. 
</P>
<P>
We need to use this situation as a learning tool for potential spills that may 
occur in the future if the people continue to allow the expansion of the oil 
industry here in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The main lesson learned in this disaster is that we need much stricter laws 
governing the transport of oil near our shores and we need to take a very hard 
look at the expansion of this industry in Orange County. Every federal, state 
and local government official in Orange County needs to be familiar with, and 
supportive of, federal and state law currently pending that would require 
double-hulled ships and an effective clean-up procedure. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) has initiated the Ocean Protection Act 
(HR 3751), which would protect the California coast from the shoreline out 145 
miles. Every member of our Orange County delegation needs to sign on to that 
piece of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments need to take a position on providing onshore support 
facilities for offshore drilling (pipelines, refineries, etc.). I believe the 
area between the Orange County coastline and Catalina Island should be 
designated a National Oceanic Park. That plan already has the support of half 
of the cities in the county and the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Orange County must realize that the strong oil lobby tightly 
connected with the current and previous administrations has produced a 
situation where the checks and balances just are not there. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Orange County need to express their opinion about the future of 
this industry in our county and express their opinion about the way and the 
reasons this disaster happened to be sure it does not happen again.

GAY APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I really want to believe that the government of the United States is great and 
fair. But I am constantly bombarded by things such as Irvine's Measure N and 
the Feb. 6 article concerning the upholding of the Defense Department's policy 
of "subjecting all homosexual applicants for 'secret' and 'top secret' 
clearance to more intense investigations than the other applicants." 
</P>
<P>
How can we label some forms of bigotry morally wrong while supporting and 
encouraging others? Why is being prejudiced against homosexuals accepted, while 
prejudices against other groups are condemned? 
</P>
<P>
All levels of government are contributing to the encouragement of this blatant 
form of bigotry. If we accept discrimination against this one group, what will 
stop us from discriminating against other groups? I don't understand how we 
allow this outright discrimination in a country that prides itself on being 
open to all people.

REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO OIL SPILL ALONG COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been a noticeable increase in the number of homeless people on the 
streets of Huntington Beach -- a sad irony in the wake of the massive 
redevelopment project the city is undergoing. This brand of redevelopment was 
initiated by politicians in collaboration with out-of-town developers. 
</P>
<P>
Our neighborhoods are being subjected to nocturnal aerial spraying of the nerve 
gas malathion -- brought to us by the petrochemical conglomerates who have 
strong lobbies in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Now our precious seashore is threatened by a nearly 400,000-gallon oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this country is the "land of the free and the home of the brave." The 
wealthy few, using the government as their tool, are free to impose the results 
of their greedy way upon the rest of us. Meanwhile, the rest of us must be 
brave in order to endure and overcome this dictatorship of amassed capital.

PARKS PROPOSITION AND IRVINE'S FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something is happening on March 6 that will have a great impact on our city. 
Irvine voters will decide whether to add to the system of parks, recreational 
and cultural opportunities we now enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the voters of Irvine looked to the future. The two bond issues they 
passed, the Parks Bond by 73.8% and the Bike Trail Bond by 71.9%, created 
today's park and recreation facilities in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these visionary voters, we now have parks, lighted ball fields, 
community centers, an Olympic Aquatic Complex, the Fine Arts Center and the 
soon-to-open Irvine Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is our turn to look to the future, just as Irvine's voters did in 1974. 
It's our turn to ensure that our parents, children and children's children will 
continue to be well-served by the city of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
On March 6, we will be voting on "Proposition Parks," a ballot proposal that 
will authorize money to build new projects, enhance existing ones, and provide 
funds to maintain and operate the new facilities without need for any further 
tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition Parks" is a comprehensive, full-spectrum proposal with a total of 
27 projects planned throughout Irvine. The cost to each Irvine household will 
be $10 per month, or about 33 cents per day, per household. This is a "total 
cost package" that includes all construction costs, maintenance costs and 
operational costs. It is a package that guarantees each project's quality. 
</P>
<P>
The choice is ours to make. For 33 cents a day we can buy a can of soda for our 
household, or we can add parks, biking/hiking/riding trails, cultural 
activities, more lighted athletic fields, and landscaped park areas for picnics 
and activities for all our citizens.

REACTION OF POLITICIANS TO OIL SPILL ALONG COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the sidebar "California Oil," on Page T6 of The Times' Special Report on the 
Huntington Beach oil spill, the first words of the text are "California is a 
net exporter of oil . . . " That simply isn't true, as is clearly shown by the 
pie chart at the left of the same piece. 
</P>
<P>
The facts are: 1) California, onshore and offshore, produces about a million 
barrels of crude oil per day. 2) California consumes about 2 million barrels of 
crude oil per day. 3) Virtually all of the million-barrel-per-day difference 
enters California by tanker, either from Alaska or Indonesia. 4) More oil 
spills, by number and by volume, come from tankers than from offshore drilling 
and production. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the facts, a parade of political demagogues has used the occasion of 
the Huntington Beach spill to come out against offshore drilling. If we had 
more offshore oil production, we would be less likely to have large oil spills.

<TEXT>
<P>
The tragedy of last week's oil spill lies in its inevitability and our failure 
to legislatively take action to avoid it. The irony is that it will happen 
again. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of numerous warnings by the Department of Interior, environmentalists 
and the oil companies, we persist in ignoring the truth. Oil and water do not 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
There are many legislative opportunities at hand to change the current policies 
governing offshore oil drilling, tanker traffic, toxic waste disposal, sewage 
dumping and emergence preparations. For example, the California Ocean Sanctuary 
Act and the National Ocean Protection Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians, as you watch the damage to our shorelines escalate, 
remember that if we truly want to, we can effect changes for the future. I 
challenge you to contact your representatives today.

LAWYER ADMITS GUILT IN ELABORATE FRAUD PLOT; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE SCAM: EXPERTS SAY THE CASE IS EMERGING AS ONE OF THE LARGEST CRIMINAL 
PROSECUTIONS OF ATTORNEYS IN U.S. HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Woodland Hills attorney who wanted to be a judge instead went before one in 
San Diego on Friday to admit criminal involvement in an elaborate insurance 
fraud by a group of Los Angeles-area lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Ficht, 39, pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud, becoming the 
fourth attorney convicted in a case experts say is emerging as one of the 
largest criminal prosecutions of attorneys in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
The four lawyers and two other people convicted thus far all lived or worked in 
the San Fernando Valley. Prosecutors have said 10 or 15 more attorneys could be 
indicted in the case, which has targeted a ring of lawyers whom prosecutors 
have called the "Alliance". 
</P>
<P>
No sentencing date was set for Ficht on the mail fraud count, which carries a 
maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and a $250,000 fine. Although 
Ficht's plea bargain was sealed by U.S. District Judge Judith N. Keep, the 
agreement is believed to require Ficht to surrender his license to practice 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Ficht declined comment after his brief court appearance, and Assistant U.S. 
Atty. George D. Hardy would not discuss specifics of Ficht's plea. But Hardy 
said that "with all of these cases we've required that the attorneys surrender 
their licenses." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times more than a year ago, Ficht denied any 
wrongdoing and bristled at allegations of misconduct. "Between you and I, I 
have hopes one day of running for judge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Friday, barely speaking above a whisper in response to questions from 
Keep, Ficht admitted conspiring with other lawyers to manipulate litigation and 
bilk insurance carriers. "In furtherance of that scheme, I assisted in billing 
insurance carriers and assisted other attorneys in billing insurance carriers," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ficht and those previously convicted described a sort of legal franchise 
operation, in which senior members of the ring set up new members with their 
own law offices, creating additional billing centers for the group. The new 
members were loaned start-up funds and sent insured defendants, and in return 
agreed to pay the group a percentage of their insurance company billings. 
</P>
<P>
Ficht told Keep he struck such a bargain with Marc Kent, a former Studio City 
lawyer who has become a key government witness since pleading guilty last 
October. Kent helped Ficht set up his law office in November, 1986, and sent 
him clients in three complex litigations in which others in the group were 
involved, known as the Amgo, Syndico and Mint Financial cases. 
</P>
<P>
Ficht said he took advice and direction from Kent, even though his Syndico 
client and Kent's had adverse interests. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Banks, who pleaded guilty last month, and Alan M. Hersh, who pleaded 
guilty in December, also said they were recruited by Kent. 
</P>
<P>
Kent, in turn, said Lynn B. Stites, whom authorities called the mastermind of 
the scheme, recruited him in about 1984. Stites, who has not been charged, has 
refused requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers appeared together in a number of complex civil cases in San Diego, 
Los Angeles and Orange that usually involved claims of investment fraud. These 
were a special type of case in which insurance companies had to pay legal bills 
but lost the right to pick their policyholders' lawyers or direct defense 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a case together, the lawyers allegedly used exhaustive discovery to run 
up defense bills, and filed cross-claims, or secondary lawsuits, against one 
another's clients, increasing each attorney's workload and defense bills. 
</P>
<P>
Although it did not figure in Ficht's plea Friday, Wayne Watson, a businessman 
who was sued in the Amgo case in San Diego and secretly worked with federal 
investigators said that Ficht once offered to pay him $300 a month to drop his 
Amgo attorney and retain Ficht to conduct his insurance-paid defense. Other 
defendants in the case were receiving payments from their attorneys, Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just slapped me upside the face as to being very blatant . . . what they 
were doing here," Watson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Ficht, who denied Watson's account of the conversation in a 1988 interview, 
ended up with another Amgo defendant.

LET'S FACE IT: NEITHER SIDE CARES ABOUT THE FANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
The Great American Lockout looms on the horizon like some thunder cloud at a 
Fourth of July picnic, and once again professional sports is faced with the 
specter of a work stoppage. Five years ago, it was major-league baseball. Three 
years ago, it was the National Football League. Now it's baseball again. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, sports have become just another labor-management feud, no different 
than the police and fire department unions haggling over a new contract. Forget 
knowing the infield-fly rule. To really understand baseball now, you now have 
to be familiar with the life and times of Samuel Gompers. 
</P>
<P>
And once again, we sports fans are supposed to know whom to root for. 
</P>
<P>
Are the players at fault, these spoiled millionaires who think it's their 
birthright to never have to work again once their careers are over? Or is it 
the owners, those bastions of business who have created these Monopoly-money 
contracts in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it seems like you need some advanced degree in negotiations to 
decipher all this. But one thing is as clear as the padlocks on the gates of 
spring-training sites. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side cares about the fans. 
</P>
<P>
Think about it. No one is talking about reducing ticket prices. No one is 
talking about reducing the cost of a hot dog. No one is saying anything about 
reducing the price of parking. Neither side is talking about putting pressure 
on cable companies to reduce their prices, or lobbying to put more games on 
regular television instead of pay television. 
</P>
<P>
All of these things would help the fan. They would help stem the tide of people 
almost needing second jobs to afford season tickets. Of having to buy sports 
channels on cable television if you want to watch many of the games. Of the 
always-rising cost of what it takes to be a sports fan nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we get talk of minimum salaries, revenue sharing, free agency and the 
amount of time a player needs to be eligible for free agency. We get talk of 
collusion and pay-for-performance, talk that makes your eyes glaze over. 
</P>
<P>
And they want you and me to care who wins this so-called labor struggle? 
</P>
<P>
Please. Be serious. 
</P>
<P>
The modern sports climate is all about greed. How much and how often. Who gets 
the biggest piece of a pie that keeps getting bigger and bigger. It's about 
owners who keep putting more and more games on pay television, all the while 
continuing to see their franchises escalate in value. It's about players who 
charge little kids for autographs at card shows, and then give us nonsense 
about how it's a great way to meet all their fans. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this allowed to go on? 
</P>
<P>
Simple. 
</P>
<P>
We let it go on. You, and I, and anyone else who are baseball fans. We buy 
sports channels on cable television. We buy tickets to the games, regardless of 
the prices. 
</P>
<P>
We are perceived as a captive audience, one that will be there regardless of 
what side emerges as the winner in this so-called labor struggle. We are the 
great unwashed, and we are treated as such. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's because we want baseball to be some throwback to innocence, some 
childhood time when players are loyal to the teams they play for, to the fans 
who cheer them, some gone-forever time when no one knew what most players made, 
and few cared. We want the players to care as much as we do. 
</P>
<P>
We don't like it when players imply that their families and their personal 
futures come before their allegiance to the team they play for and the fans who 
cheer them. All that speaks of real life, one of the things we go to baseball 
games to forget about. 
</P>
<P>
That's the problem with the lockout. 
</P>
<P>
It takes away all the pretense, robs us of the innocence. It clearly 
demonstrates major-league baseball is a business, no different from any other, 
complete with its omnipresent labor problems. 
</P>
<P>
Say it ain't so, Joe. 
</P>
<P>
Not that we won't be back when the lockout is over. 
</P>
<P>
We will come crawling back like some jilted lover who gets a second chance, our 
hearts once again on our sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
For we are all junkies and, like junkies everywhere, we will get our fix, 
whatever the cost. We are the suckers who will stand in line to pay players for 
autographs at card shows. We will pay at least $10 to park, and then pay more 
for soggy hotdogs and watered-down beer. We will keep paying for sports 
channels on TV, and stay up late at night to watch the World Series because 
some TV mogul somewhere figured out that ratings are better. 
</P>
<P>
That is a reality. 
</P>
<P>
But don't insult me. 
</P>
<P>
Spare me any talk about who is right and who is wrong, in this Great American 
Lockout. Both sides are portraits in greed. The owners who cry poverty while 
their franchises continue to escalate in value. The players who want us to 
think they are some poor struggling union in the middle of a battle with big, 
bad management. 
</P>
<P>
So spare me any talk that this latest work stoppage is any marvelous quest. 
This is about what professional sports have become, and there are no winners. 
</P>
<P>
Just people like you and me that neither side cares about.

<TEXT>
<P>
This is a really great time in boxing, maybe the best ever. This is the real 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody should enjoy it more than us abolitionists. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Marx Brothers, the Smothers Brothers, The Three Stooges, Martin and 
Lewis, Rowan and Martin, Stiller and Meara, Harold Lloyd, Marty Allen, Jonathan 
Winters, George Steinbrenner and Mr. Dithers. This is Alex Karras knocking out 
the horse with one punch in "Blazing Saddles." This is Ghostbusters and 
Dustbusters. This is Don King. 
</P>
<P>
This is boxing at its finest. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind for just a minute that by now we should have evolved beyond an event 
in which two people try to kill each other for the sake of entertainment. That 
is the intention of the game: kill your opponent or knock his brain into 
oblivion and you win a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
Our society says you're not allowed to do that with dogs or chickens who have 
been bred to kill. You're not allowed to put a man and a bull in the ring and 
have them fight it out. That's wrong. Some day we may get around to outgrowing 
aspects of football, but injury is not the expressed intent of that game. 
</P>
<P>
We can decry the ease and comfort with which people kill and maim and hurt 
other people in our cities, and wring our hands that it marks the downfall of 
our civilization. But then we make fistic heroes of thugs like King and Mike 
Tyson and the line of others who would be mugging people in parking lots or 
doing knees for crack dealers if boxing didn't legalize their taste for mayhem. 
Tyson is a brutal person with a sweetheart's voice. 
</P>
<P>
My feeling was profoundly influenced one evening in a bar in Baltimore when 
some patron said something to a waitress and the bartender went over the top of 
the bar for him. I'll never forget the sound of the bartender's fists on the 
man's face. Some people liken that to the sound of the crack of the bat on the 
ball. Look and listen to the bloodlust at ringside. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing sweet in the "sweet science" and never was. There's more 
reality in the current film "Triumph of the Spirit," in which an Olympic boxer, 
a Greek Jew, is forced by the Germans to fight in a concentration camp -- 
winner gets to live and feed his family and loser goes to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, boxing captured the imagination of some of our gifted writers 
and made them feel there was something noble and romantic about it. Hemingway 
felt it. Liebling felt it. These big lugs, they said, these noble savages were 
going out there into the squared circle to suffer and endure and display their 
courage because that's what they were good for. That smacks of racism without 
racial distinction. 
</P>
<P>
But this current affair goes a delicious step further. This is stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the details that surrounded Buster battering Tyson in Tokyo. It was 
one of the shockingly great upsets in all of sports history, which explains the 
great appeal of sports on TV. It's the last real suspense. 
</P>
<P>
But isn't it wrong when Buster Douglas, in order to get his shot at the 
champion, had to cede promotional rights to his next three fights to King? So, 
in effect, King held promotion ties to both sides in Tokyo and to the 
inevitable rematch. Would it be wrong if a tennis player had to change agents 
in order to play Wimbledon? 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no structure of league standings, three different groups can 
have separate champions of the world and New Jersey. Championship playoffs are 
made for the money potential -- either right now or in protecting the future. 
And then, of course, the promoter lies like anything. 
</P>
<P>
Like Tuesday, King, hair and his face straight, said he never tried to overturn 
the decision. Can you imagine any other sport in which the owner of one side -- 
or both -- can closet two commissioners after the contest and not open the door 
until they decide like Larry, Moe and Curly, there can be no champion before 
they hold a meeting a week later. 
</P>
<P>
All King said he wanted was a rematch for his fighter. The rules of the 
alphabet organizations say immediate rematches are prohibited. But if the 
commissioners could be made to doubt what they had seen with their own eyes, 
then they could justify setting aside the rules for King's big-bucks rematch. 
</P>
<P>
When the closet door opened in Tokyo, referee Octavio Meyran pleaded guilty for 
giving Buster the benefit of the long count. "I'd like to recognize my 
mistake," he said, for not having picked up the count from the timekeeper at 
ringside. Is there something wrong with a sport that stages its showcase event 
and then questions the competence of the person it has chosen to be the 
referee? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the alphabet groups recognized Buster as the new champion and King 
plaintively appealed for the justice of a rematch. Is there any doubt he'll get 
it? 
</P>
<P>
But first, basics. Look at the scorecards of the three judges at the time Tyson 
was counted out. The American judge had Buster considerably ahead, as did most 
of the media witnesses. One of the Japanese judges had Tyson ahead and the 
other had the score tied. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that silly. Imagine the Lakers playing the Knicks for the championship 
without a scoreboard: Nobody knows who's in front until the buzzer has sounded 
and the referee has added up the ones, twos and treys. There could be no 
four-corners offense to kill time, no hurry-up offense to close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
But then with boxing's secret ballot, neither the crowd nor players can see if 
the judges are calling the fight or jumping to Don King's service. Remember the 
travesty of the Olympic boxing in Korea. This is the real stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Liebling told of Pierce Egan, who wrote in the 1820s of "pageant scenes of 
trulls and lushes, toffs and toddlers ... setting off for some great public, 
illegal prize fight." And of the painter Rowlandson's print of the 1811 fight 
between Tom Cribb, the champion, and Tom Molyneaux, "an American Negro ... In 
the foreground of the picture, there is a whore sitting on her gentleman's 
shoulders, the better to see the fight, while a pickpocket lifts the 
gentleman's reader (watch). Cribb has just hit Molyneaux the floorer ..." 
</P>
<P>
Listen, do you smell Las Vegas or Atlantic City?

THEY'RE THE SPURS OF THE MOMENT

<P>
SAN ANTONIO, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is hope for the hopeless, life for the lifeless, maybe even a home for 
the homeless, at HemisFair Arena these days. The San Antonio Spurs are living 
proof that the 98-pound weakling with braces, acne and a lisp can grow up to 
get the girl. The day cannot be far away when any self-respecting gym rat wears 
a wristwatch, black socks and generic sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the possibilities, now that the most-improved basketball team on this 
planet owes its success in part to: 
</P>
<P>
An ordained minister-keyboard-player-songwriter who takes medication to ensure 
that his heart beats regularly; 
</P>
<P>
The world's tallest known Navy Lieutenant, who is as likely to practice on the 
keyboard as on his jump shot; 
</P>
<P>
One failed trumpet player; 
</P>
<P>
A guy who answers to Brick and, for fun, collects guns; 
</P>
<P>
A 22-year-old rookie whose heroics once allowed his ninth-grade team to get 
beat "only" 100-18; 
</P>
<P>
And a little old guy named Cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
From the ruins of 21 victories and 61 defeats in 1988-89, Spur Coach Larry 
Brown and assistant to the chairman Bob Bass have built a team that ranks among 
the National Basketball Association's elite. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs return from the All-Star break with the sixth-best record in the 
league (32-15) and are on pace to go 57-25. Such a turnaround would be the 
biggest in NBA history, surpassing the 32-game improvement the Larry Bird-led 
Boston Celtics made from '78-79 to '79-80. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine how high the Spurs can climb once they finish learning each others' 
names and games. Only three current Spurs were on the active roster at the end 
of last season. Two rookies, David Robinson and Sean Elliott, are accounting 
for 31% of the scoring, 34% of the rebounding and 52% of the shot-blocking. And 
here the Spurs are anyway, within dunking distance of catching the Lakers in 
the race for the best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"This," Brown admits, "is a shock." 
</P>
<P>
This is a far cry from last year, when Brown was about ready for shock 
treatments. Brown, remember, came to the Spurs last season fresh off having 
guided the Kansas Jayhawks to the 1988 national championship. He had a 
five-year, $3.5-million contract and visions of taking a 7-foot-1 David and 
building a Goliath of a team. The Navy sunk those plans two weeks before the 
season, ruling Robinson had to serve another year before joining the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
Without Robinson, the Spurs suffered a team-record, 13-game losing streak en 
route to the worst season in franchise history. Brown clashed with the best 
player he inherited, All-Star Alvin Robertson. Brown clashed with the best 
player he brought in, 6-7 rookie swingman Willie Anderson. Brown, in short, 
crashed and burned to his first losing season in 17 as a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
With Robinson -- plus veteran reinforcements Terry Cummings, Maurice Cheeks and 
Caldwell Jones -- home attendance is at a franchise high of 14,071 per game. 
The HemisFair crowd usually gets what it comes to see, too. The Spurs are tied 
for the best home record in the league at 21-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have definitely turned around," Anderson says. "A year ago, I wouldn't 
have believed it if someone had said we would be 32-14. But then if someone had 
told me the team would consist of the guys it does now . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs were a revolving door leading to nowhere last season, using a 
league-high 22 players -- to used the word loosely. A May 28 trade that sent 
Robertson to the Milwaukee Bucks and brought Cummings proved to be a step in 
the right direction. Exactly three months later, the Spurs acquired the 6-1 
Cheeks, swingman David Wingate and center Chris Welp from the Philadelphia 
76ers for guard Johnny Dawkins and forward Jay Vincent. The draft brought 
Elliott. Free agency brought Jones, a 39-year-old settling influence for 
Robinson. Just like that, Brown had purged himself of the team even he had to 
have been tempted to boo. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked at our team at training camp," Brown says, recalling the dark days, 
"and I honestly thought the University of Kansas could have beaten that team 
because of our attitude and work habits and stuff. It was a terrible feeling 
going into the arena and going around town. People were upset. You know, a lot 
of people get pretty personal with it. I'd never been in a situation where the 
fans didn't appreciate what we were doing. It has always been like a honeymoon 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Now it's like one wedding night after another for the Spurs. A lovefest. 
</P>
<P>
"The chemistry is right," Cummings says. "The attitude is right. People will do 
whatever it takes to win. We have people who have accepted their role." 
</P>
<P>
Cummings is a proven All-Star-level player, an eight-year veteran whose 22.4 
points and 8.1 rebounds per game are right in line with his career figures. He 
is unflinching in tough situations, fortified, no doubt, by having overcome 
early in his career a scare caused by having an irregular heartbeat. Anderson 
made the right decision to give up the trumpet, if his versatility on a 
basketball court (16.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, 4.1 assists) means anything. 
Cheeks, at age 33, is elderly by point-guard standards. He is around as much 
for his steadiness and unflappability as his 11.1 points and 6.0 assists per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Brickowski is "Brick," though his shooting touch is nothing of the sort. 
Since taking over for Elliott as a starter at forward two weeks ago, Brickowski 
has averaged 10 points and five rebounds on 68% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is the anchor of it all, an ominous defensive presence Golden State 
Coach Don Nelson likens to Hall of Famer Bill Russell. For good measure, 
Robinson contributes 23.2 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.1 blocked shots and 2.2 
assists per game. Cheeks credits Robinson for making all of the Spurs' pieces 
fit together. The pressure defense. The passing game on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"David has a lot to do with it," says Cheeks, who touts Robinson as the 
league's Most Valuable Player. "When you have a big man to go to, a lot of 
things around here get easier. He makes everyone around him better." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson arguably has outshined the rookie performance of the NBA's most highly 
acclaimed big men, Patrick Ewing and Akeem Olajuwon. Ewing averaged 20 points, 
nine rebounds and two blocks as a rookie, compared to 20, 12 and three for 
Olajuwon. Keep in mind, also, that Robinson hasn't had the luxury -- except for 
a stint on the 1988 Olympic team -- of honing his skills against top-flight 
competition the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to play defense and rebound," Robinson says. "They don't need me to 
score 30 points and do everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I get into double figures in points, I don't think about it anymore. 
Rebounding, I think of constantly because I never know how many I have -- 
unless I only have two rebounds at halftime. Then they'll say, 'You've only got 
two rebounds.' So if I know how many rebounds I have, I'm in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Suffice it to say, Robinson isn't in trouble often. He had 33 points, 21 
rebounds, six assists and five blocked shots, for instance, in a 112-111 home 
victory against Chicago Feb. 3. He more than held his own in Sunday's All-Star 
game with 15 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he could be great," Brown says, "but I had no idea it would come this 
quick." 
</P>
<P>
All Robinson has going for him is intelligence (1,320 on his SAT), 
Olajuwonesque quickness, deceptive strength near the basket, a deft left-handed 
touch. He has enough respect from the referees to rank second in the league in 
free-throw attempts. Best of all, he expects even more from himself. All-Star 
as a rookie? He shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's not the greatest thing that ever happens in my career," Robinson 
says. "Or my career won't be very long." 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, the Spurs will have to wait a bit for greatness as a team. 
They are just getting to know each other, they lack scoring punch off the 
bench, and Brown considers them vulnerable on the boards. Cheeks is playing 35 
minutes a night on legs that aren't 25 anymore. At times, Elliott has looked 
like the guy whose team got beat, 100-18, and the Spurs don't figure to be at 
their peak until he has established himself as a prime-time starter. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Spurs already are a light-year way away from the days of Anderson 
saying, "This isn't a team. This is a soap opera." Winning cures a lot of ills, 
including tense player-coach relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what coach Brown and I went through last year gave us an understanding 
of each other," Anderson says. "I know now that he says things negative to 
motivate you and improve you. I understand him now and our relationship is 
better because I know he's trying to help, not bring me down. That's what I 
thought last year. I thought I was playing against him and the other team." 
</P>
<P>
Brown knows the feeling. There were times it seemed like he was taking on the 
world. The boos still ring in his ears of a 49-year-old man who is perpetually 
in between homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about people," Brown says. "I will never take winning for granted. I 
appreciate the success that we've had so much more."

HOW THE FANS DEFEND FREE THROWS IN COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS O'TOOLE, SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foul shots are called "free" throws, but they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
Fans guard the line as best they can, deploying a variety of distracting, 
defensive tricks far beyond ear-popping yells and waving arms. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year at Syracuse, somebody threw an orange at me," said Georgetown guard 
Mark Tillmon. "It was really wild." 
</P>
<P>
Fan participation raises questions about where school spirit ends and bad 
sportsmanship begins. Big East Commissioner Dave Gavitt this season ordered 
cheerleaders to stop pounding megaphones at courtside during free throws. 
Georgia Tech now prohibits students from waving multi-colored cards behind the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
But, the game inside the game goes on. Distracting opponents is serious 
business, an expanding art form. Some students try posters of scantily clad 
women to shake up shooters. Others use optical illusions. 
</P>
<P>
According to Art Hyland, Big East supervisor of officials, rules prohibit pep 
bands from playing while the ball is alive. Another rule outlaws objects being 
thrown onto the floor. Nothing prohibits waving arms or flashing posters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard stories of flashing camera lights from the student section," said 
Hyland. "That's not allowed. But on the one hand, we don't want to do anything 
to discourage fans from supporting their team and doing everything they can to 
be enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Coach Hugh Durham thinks cheerleaders, bands and others officially 
associated with a school should not be involved in guarding free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's poor taste," said Durham. "I think the fans can do pretty much 
what they want to, as long as it's not throwing anything. Shaking posters, 
shakers . . . that's just part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"To try to eliminate it would be a mistake. Kids are conditioned to shooting 
free throws with people waving their hands and doing all sorts of things. The 
real good competitors can't think of anything better than to hit one when all 
that's going on and silence everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The more noise the better, goes prevailing thinking. But Abe Lemons, 
coach-comedian for 34 years, suggests a radical alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"What gets you is total quiet," said Lemons, back at Oklahoma City after stints 
at Pan American and Texas. "Kids love to play with noise and a full house. 
That's the reason we didn't play well at Rice. There was never anyone there. 
</P>
<P>
"Try total quiet a few times. After having the noise reverberating in your ears 
all game, all of a sudden, it's quiet. That's tough. As smart as the Duke crowd 
is, I'm surprised they haven't thought of that. They ought to try it a few 
times, waste a few early in the game and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Duke fans, unofficial national champs of innovative behavior, aren't quite 
ready for that. 
</P>
<P>
"Staying silent would be hard to get everybody to do," said Glenn "Baskethead" 
Coleman, a Duke student who wears half a basketball, a rim and net on his head 
to games. 
</P>
<P>
"And we wouldn't want to take the chance of wasting any early in the game. 
Those are the ones that come back to haunt you at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Crowd enthusiasm comes in imaginative ways. A sampling of tactics around the 
country: 
</P>
<P>
Duke possesses a veritable arsenal of ploys. "Baskethead" says they never start 
in one place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's random people," he said. "Anybody can do it. We love it. And a lot of 
players love it. But I've seen some teams who have never been here before look 
at us with a strange expression, like, 'What are those people doing?' Then, 
they try to pretend we're not there." 
</P>
<P>
One of the Blue Devils' most creative acts is an attempt to upset a shooter's 
equalibrium. Fans behind the basket stand up, raise their arms and lean to one 
side. The intent is to make the shooter think he is off balance. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, fans rotate their fists in unison to mimmick an official's 
walking call and create a hallucinatory effect. They also use what they call 
the "whippoorwill." Fans behind the basket raise their arms and swirl and dip 
their bodies to create a whirlpool look. Other times, they stay eerily quiet 
until the shooter is ready to release the ball. Then, they erupt. 
</P>
<P>
The latest trick is jingling keys. It's a distracting sound. They used to spin 
multi-colored umbrellas behind the basket, a practice quickly outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss a lot of the things they do," said Krzyzewski. "But my wife and 
daughter will write things down for me. On the way home from the game they'll 
say, 'Here's what they said' in a certain situation. I'll say, 'You gotta be 
kidding me. How did they come up with that?" 
</P>
<P>
Stunningly, Duke opponents shoot better in Cameron Indoor Stadium than they do 
at home (69.5 to 66.4). 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen a few guys rattled, like a guy from Notre Dame," said Coleman. "But 
it's not whether it works or not. It's if everybody enjoys it. It's all about 
having fun." 
</P>
<P>
Said Lemons, "Nobody's ever figured out free throws or how to stop them. The 
good shooters will make their free throws. I don't think crowd noise is much of 
a disruptive factor. Taking the crowd out of the game, that's something Al 
McGuire started. That's a bunch of bull. Icing a guy at the line by calling 
time? That doesn't work. The way to ice a guy who can't shoot is let him shoot. 
People don't work on their free throws. They'd rather have a 360 miss than a 
wide-open shot." 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State fans use props they call hypno-dots, green paper squares with 
a large black dot in the middle. When a foul shooter looks to the basket, fans 
behind the goal wave the cards back and forth to fog his sightline. 
</P>
<P>
Facing 700 black-and-green dancing cards, Cal State Long Beach shooters went 15 
for 27. A local car dealer got excited. Hoping for an advertising bonanza, he 
donated white cards with a red "S" for fans to use. UC Irvine ate them for 
dessert -- 21 of 26. 
</P>
<P>
State's tactics might be working overall. Opponents hit 63.2% of their free 
throws at New Mexico State. They shoot 65.2 in their own gyms against State. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech stopped using dots because operations manager John O'Neill decided 
the cards came too close to violating a coliseum rule against noisemakers and 
signs. O'Neill felt they approached the limit of good sportsmanship. They also 
weren't working. Duke made 23 of 31 free throws and won in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of girls in bikinis are popular. Some schools even have used pictures 
of obese women in bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
At Maryland, fans unfurl a wide poster of a bikini-clad beauty on her side. 
It's eye-catching. Opponents shoot six percentage points worse at Cole Field 
House than at home. Maryland students take their defensive role seriously. When 
doors open for general-admission seating, many race past midcourt to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Loud yells are a staple. Some have a special message. When Georgetown's Alonzo 
Mourning went to the foul line at Madison Square Garden recently, St. John's 
fans chanted, "Just say no! Just say no!" That was a reference to Mourning's 
friendship with a reputed drug figure. 
</P>
<P>
Despite probation, Kentucky has drawn its wildest and loudest crowds. The noise 
apparently is having an effect. Opponents shoot 69% in Rupp Arena and 75% at 
their gyms. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson can turn up the volume. It holds opponents to 64.8% at Littlejohn 
Coliseum. They shoot 10 points better when Clemson visits their place. 
</P>
<P>
At Missouri, where the antics of a group of students called the Antlers are 
legendary, opponents are barely bothered at the line. Students are stuck on the 
side of the court because boosters who have acquired end zone seats over the 
years refuse to relinquish them. The Antlers have creative yells ("Save the 
whales" for overweight players). But they've been known to yell at their own 
fans behind the basket for not making noise. 
</P>
<P>
Three innovative disruptions no longer exist. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's floor is built on springs. According to spokesman Bob Vazquez, 
students found if they stomped their feet enough, the floor vibrated. Two years 
ago, when Arizona's Sean Elliott went to the line late in a game, there was a 
whole lot of shaking going on. Arizona Voach Lute Olson was so upset, he 
complained to officials. The Pac-10 told Stanford to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any problems since," said Vazquez. "We'd like to do it, but we 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
Before Wake Forest's coliseum was remodeled, students sat on the floor near the 
base of the basket. When an opponent was at the line, students would kick the 
base, causing the rim to shake. Officials often made the shooter wait until the 
rim stopped vibrating. 
</P>
<P>
At Texas-El Paso, fans mourn the passing of the Miner Maniacs. They were a 
group of fanatics who wore Viking hats and carried plastic swords. When an 
opponent went to the foul line, the Maniacs would charge down an aisle behind 
the basket, waving their swords and yelling their battle cry. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming distractions is simply a matter of concentration, says an 
experienced foul shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"You just block everything out," said Kansas State's Steve Henson, a career 
89-percenter. "We talk about that as a team, keeping everything between the 
lines and not letting anything outside the court affect you. I always talk 
about concentrating on one thing." 
</P>
<P>
Supporting Lemons' logic, Henson says it's easier when the crowd is loud and 
the shots mean the most. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Henson set the Big Eight record with 48 consecutive free throws, 
including 17 in a row at Iowa State. In that game, he showed how a shooter can 
silence a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
After an altercation, K-State was awarded eight technical free throws. The 
crowd was in a frenzy. Henson made one, then another, then another. By the time 
he hit the eighth, the crowd was silent. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the shooter's revenge.

AROUND THE HOUSE: HOME WISE;

<P>
FEW WATER-SAVING DEVICES TESTED RIGOROUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: When I buy water-saving toilet products, what should I look for? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Many water-saving products for toilets haven't received rigorous 
testing to determine long-term performance and reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Until more testing is done, we can't be sure which are the best. If you do see 
a water- or energy-saving device you think might work, consider these buyer 
tips: 
</P>
<P>
First, take your time. Don't be high-pressured into buying because of a 
one-time special price. Reputable sales people will give you time to make up 
your mind. 
</P>
<P>
Then, look at your present costs. Estimate how much of your water and sewer 
bill is due to toilet flushing. Note that toilet flushing uses more water than 
any other tap in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have estimated the cost, find out the pay-back. How long will it take 
you to get your money back after you purchase the product? Will the product 
last that long? Do you plan to be in the same house that long? 
</P>
<P>
Become educated about the water-saving device. Find out about the different 
types of devices available, their cost, and their advantages and drawbacks. 
Free information should be available through libraries. You might also try 
contacting competing firms to see if they carry the same product. Estimates 
from those firms can be very useful. 
</P>
<P>
Look closely at claims. What kinds of tests are the claims based on? Was the 
testing done by an independent, recognized testing laboratory? 
</P>

Check out the business you are dealing with. It's a good idea to get estimates 
from different companies for the water-saving device you are considering. Price 
should not be the only factor in making the decision. Is this a product you can 
install yourself, or will it require a plumber?

Contact the Better Business Bureau to find out how long the firm has been in 
business. Ask also about its record.

Solar Pool Heater Is Inexpensive, Practical 
</P>
<P>
Q: We spent $200 a month heating our swimming pool last year with natural gas. 
Could we reduce costs by using a solar pool heater? How expensive, how 
complicated, and how practical is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: They can be inexpensive, simple and very practical. Solar pool heaters let 
you dive into spring earlier and stroke deeper into fall. 
</P>
<P>
The season in the sun can stretch from three months to as many as six. Your 
energy savings will pay for the equipment and installation in just a few 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Solar pool heaters need a large area for the solar collectors, on average, 75% 
of the surface area of the pool. A 20x30-foot pool needs 450 square feet of 
south-facing collectors. In many cases, the pump that filters the pool water 
can be used to circulate water through the collectors. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic controller turns the pump on and off as it senses heating supply 
and demand. Some installers are willing to reduce costs slightly if handy 
homeowners donate semi-skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, a good pool cover saves money and time by keeping heat in and 
debris out. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerator Consumes a Lot of Electricity 
</P>
<P>
Q: We went away on vacation for a month and unplugged our electric appliances 
to lower our electric bills. We also switched off the hot water heater. The 
only appliance we left plugged in was the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Our electric bill still seemed high for that month. Can the refrigerator be 
using that much electricity? It's only two years old. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your refrigerator is the third greatest consumer of energy in the home. The 
thermostat setting can make a big difference in how much electricity it uses. 
Thermostats on refrigerators are often inaccurate. Manufacturers put arbitrary 
numbers, like one through six, rather than temperatures on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
To determine what setting to use, you'll need to find out the actual 
temperature inside the refrigerator. Put a thermometer inside the refrigerator 
compartment and look at the reading in an hour or two. Adjust the thermostat 
until you get a setting between 35-38F. 
</P>
<P>
If the freezer compartment has a separate thermostat, set it between 0-5F. 
Stand-alone freezers should be set at 0F. 
</P>
<P>
When you check the temperature inside your refrigerator, take it in several 
places. Varying temperatures may mean you need to defrost the freezer 
compartment or vacuum the dust from the coils on the back or bottom of the 
appliance. 
</P>
<P>
Dust on the coils makes the unit use more energy. If the heat can't be 
dispersed easily, the compressor has to work longer for the same benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other energy-saving tips: 
</P>
<P>
Locate the refrigerator/freezer away from the stove, dishwasher or direct 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Leave four inches around the condenser coils (usually located in the back of 
the unit) for air to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
Replace leaky or broken door seals. 
</P>
<P>
Use "power saver" or "energy miser" switches unless excessive moisture buildup 
on outside surface occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Reports magazine found a 5F colder setting increased the electrical 
consumption by as much as 30%. Models with the largest freezers had the biggest 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Homeowners Foundation (AHF), disputes often arise 
between homeowners and home-improvement contractors. 
</P>
<P>
They usually concern issues that were not discussed clearly at the time of 
hire. 
</P>
<P>
To help reduce misunderstandings -- and legal problems -- the AHF has developed 
a model contract. It alerts all parties to the areas most often resulting in 
disputes, if not addressed in advance. 
</P>
<P>
You can obtain a copy of the Model Owner-Vendor Contract ($5.95). Send a check 
or money order payable to American Homeowners Foundation to the foundation, at 
1724 S. Quincy St., Arlington, VA 22204. Additional copies are $1.95. 
Professionals can buy a set of 20 contracts for $24.95.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: SBA MAY HAVE JUST THE DEAL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCING: AGENCY'S GUARANTEES HAVE ENABLED SMALL COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES TO 
OBTAIN FAVORABLE REAL ESTATE LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Forget most of what you've heard about the U.S. Small Business Administration 
and its loan program, say local lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers looking for start-up capital or a loan without collateral need not 
apply. Borrowers turned down elsewhere for insufficient credit are out of luck 
too, they add. 
</P>
<P>
But if it's a commercial real estate loan you want, the SBA may have just the 
deal you've been looking for, said Sidney Moray, chief executive officer of 
Government Funding Corp., a private Hollywood-based lender that concentrates on 
disbursing SBA-backed loans. 
</P>
<P>
Small commercial real estate loans are all but off limits to most troubled 
savings and loans and to banks accustomed to dealing exclusively with big 
accounts, Moray said. 
</P>
<P>
That has left buyers of business properties with few options when it comes to 
financing $500,000 to $2 million deals. The few loans that are available often 
have to be paid back in less than 10 years and carry prohibitively high 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Through the SBA's loan guarantee program, however, private lenders get up to 
$750,000 of their business loans backed by the U.S. government in case the 
borrower defaults. 
</P>
<P>
These same lenders are also able to offer 25-year loans -- with no balloon 
payments and with less than a month's wait for approval -- all at conventional 
loan rates. The result, said Moray, is that "we are swamped with requests for 
loans." 
</P>
<P>
Originally conceived as a federal program to bolster entrepreneurs, the SBA's 
guarantee program has evolved into a massive commercial real estate lending 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The agency estimates that at least 35% of its $676 million in California loan 
guarantees last year went to finance real estate deals. Local lenders, however, 
report that 40% to 100% of their SBA-guaranteed loans are being disbursed for 
the purchase or development of commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
After shopping several lenders for a $450,000 loan to finance the purchase of 
their Culver City automotive engineering facility, Richard and Willy Guldstrand 
decided to try getting an SBA loan through private lender Government Funding 
Corp. of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Main-line lenders "didn't want to touch our loan application," said Willy 
Guldstrand. But with an SBA loan guarantee, she said, "we had no problems." 
</P>
<P>
"The banks were much harder to deal with," reported borrower Agapito Cordero 
Jr. He and his family borrowed $480,000 to finance the purchase of their 
automobile body shop in La Puente. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial loan was more expensive," he said, because lenders didn't want 
to spread his payments over 25 years. The SBA-guarantee program made it 
possible to get a long-term loan, however. For Cordero, buying his own business 
"was an All-American dream." 
</P>
<P>
By hooking up with the SBA, "we've been able to help customers we couldn't 
otherwise make a loan to," said Jim Whitney, senior vice president at American 
Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks. That's why, he reasoned, "the SBA program 
is becoming a more frequently used method for real estate financing." 
</P>
<P>
At American Pacific, he said, more than half of his SBA loan disbursements go 
to finance the purchase of commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The bank prefers such loans, he said, because they carry the backing of the 
federal government and allow the bank to be more flexible in some of the terms 
it offers to qualified borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, he predicts, many lenders will compete to become SBA lenders -- 
especially as a secondary market develops among investors interested in buying 
whole SBA-backed loan portfolios on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
New underwriting requirements have also prohibited many lenders from making 
what can often be very profitable small business and real estate loans. The 
SBA's backing, however, can make these loans pass regulatory muster. 
</P>
<P>
Such loans are not available to everyone. Only about one out of every 20 
interested borrowers actually qualifies. Further, the property being bought or 
developed must be used as the buyer's place of business. Most important, say 
lenders, is that the borrower exhibit a healthy cash flow and bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"What we look for first is management," said Jerry Morita, an executive at 
Mechanics National Bank in Paramount. "We view it primarily as a business loan, 
not as a real estate loan." 
</P>
<P>
Morita estimated that 30% of his bank's SBA-backed loans are being used for 
real estate. And, he expects such loans to become more common. Most banks don't 
make long-term commercial real estate loans anymore, he said, so "the SBA 
program is becoming more and more competitive." In essence, he said, "it 
provides a cushion to stretch out payments." 
</P>
<P>
This cushion, added Government Funding's Moray, makes SBA-guaranteed loans "the 
most attractive game in town." In fact, his company did nothing but SBA-backed 
loans last year, racking up a loan volume of $59 million in California -- and 
making his company No. 1 in SBA lending state-wide. 
</P>
<P>
What most prospective borrowers don't understand, he added, is that the reality 
of SBA loans today has little to do with what the program was like just a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are most loans directly from the government and incentives for lending to 
women and minorities. Gone too are the days of risky loans that created an 
astronomical default rate in the 1970s. Borrowers, Moray said, qualify purely 
on the basis of their financial ability -- nothing more and nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
If all the numbers add up to the borrower's favor, Moray said, loan approval 
can be a very quick process. The SBA can provide borrowers with a list of 
so-called preferred lenders that are authorized to approve a loan without first 
passing the paper work to the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
And so-called certified lenders need only pass a loan application to the SBA 
for a cursory glance. In some cases, Moray said, he can process a loan and cut 
a check within seven days.

Business Park Planned in Santa Fe Springs 
</P>
<P>
McGranahan Carlson &amp; Co. is planning a $120-million business park on 102 
acres it bought late last year in Santa Fe Springs. The Culver City-based 
developer bought the site from a subsidiary of Santa Fe Railroad and has named 
its project MC&amp;C Commerce Center II. Located near the junction of the Santa 
Ana (5) and San Gabriel (605) freeways, this master-planned office and 
industrial development is less than 1 mile from the company's 
185,000-square-foot MC&amp;C Commerce Center I, completed in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Work is already under way to prepare a 15-acre portion of the newly acquired 
site for the project's first phase, offering a total of 300,000 square feet. 
McGranahan Carlson and joint-venture partner Old Stone Development Corp. of 
Providence, R.I. plan a total of 1.5 million square feet of commercial 
development at the new center. 
</P>
<P>
Trizec Properties Inc. finally closed escrow on its purchase of about 22 acres 
of Warner Center property from Dataproducts Corp. Calgary. Canada-based Trizec 
has been trying to buy the two parcels along Erwin Street for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
When the printer company rebuffed its first offer, Trizec cut a deal to buy the 
properties for $57 million from DPC Acquisition Partners, a group of dissident 
Dataproducts shareholders that made several unsuccessful attempts last year at 
an unfriendly takeover. When that strategy didn't work, Trizec returned to 
Dataproducts with a new offer for $63 million last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, buyer and seller have been haggling over the details. The closing 
price, reported Trizec broker Julien J. Studley Inc., was $59.5 million, giving 
Trizec a $3.5-million discount on its offer to make up for recently discovered 
"environmental" problems that need to be remedied at the sites. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to rest on its laurels, Trizec is considering plans to develop the 
properties after Dataproducts moves out in two years and also is entertaining 
offers to sell out. One such offer may be forthcoming from billionaire Marvin 
Davis who has expressed an interest in buying at least part of the property for 
a new Sports Club L.A. in the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Leed Properties of Beverly Hills is developing 18.5 acres of Chino property 
into a $40-million distribution complex at Chino Industrial Park. Oltmans 
Construction Co. of Whittier has initiated work on five buildings that will 
provide nearly 800,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow Co. has added to its land holdings in Santa Fe Springs with the 
acquisition of 32 acres fronting Norwalk Boulevard in Santa Fe Springs. The 
site will be combined with an 18-acre parcel the company already owns to create 
The Colonnade, an office and industrial center totaling up to 900,000 square 
feet of development. 
</P>
<P>
Swede-Cal Properties Inc. paid $15.3 million for the Anaheim Corporate Center, 
totaling 158,149 square feet of office and R&amp;D space on 9.3 acres. Tenants 
at the project's four buildings include Control Data and R.J. Reynolds.

Benny L. Kass' Jan. 27 column seriously misinforms readers about 
adjustable-rate mortgages with a deferred interest option. He stated: "Under no 
circumstances can I recommend the negative amortization mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
This is poor financial advice. 
</P>
<P>
The best designed ARMs provide for the deferral of interest. The 
deferred-interest option is, perhaps, the most important consumer protection a 
well-designed ARM can offer because it helps the borrower to avoid payment 
shock. The alternative would be a sharp increase in the monthly payment. In 
some cases, borrowers might be forced to move or default. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the myth that negative amortization is something bad, home loans 
with the deferred-interest option give most borrowers a better deal. Borrowers 
with the deferred-interest option will pay lower total mortgage payments, lower 
monthly payments and still build up substantial equity. They will not lose 
ground if their home appreciates as little as 3% or 4% per year.

While Kass' explanation of a lower start rate and actual higher interest rate 
being charged was correct, the additional features and benfits of this type of 
loan were omitted. 
</P>
<P>
With negative amortization, the borrower can pay the lower initial monthly 
payment based on let's say 7 1/2% or 8 1/2%, but has the option to pay the 
difference if the rate being charged is higher, to use the article's example 
"10% or 11%." 
</P>
<P>
This allows homeowners to meet the needs of their monthly cash-flow 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, this type of a loan offers many payment options, another one 
being paying a loan off in full, that was originally written for 40 years in 15 
years. Furthermore, this type of loan may have a built-in feature to access 
equity in the future. 
</P>
<P>
And last, but certainly not least, principle reduction of an adjustable-rate 
loan can also afford a lower payment. Unlike fixed-rate loans, where the 
payment remains the same. If a borrower were to make a lump sum payment on 
their loan, let's say $5,000 or $10,000, when the loan is re-amortized, the 
payment will be based on only the remaining principle.

fairness and balance were not observed in the Feb. 4 article "Watt Project 
Linked to Replacement Housing" concerning the 62-story skyscraper to be built 
on the west side of the Harbor Freeway at 8th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The article described this project in the most benign terms, suggesting that 
nothing but good -- jobs, day-care and low-income housing -- will come from it. 
</P>
<P>
The city Department of Transportation has concluded that when the area's 64 
buildings, nearly completed, under construction or in an advanced planning 
stage are finished, the Harbor Freeway will be so overwhelmed that eight 
additional lanes would be required to handle the inevitable traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The drawing you used to illustrate the project was both ironic and inaccurate. 
It showed the massive project adjacent to a near-empty Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The truth -- which readers of your article would never have gleaned -- is that 
the project will make the existing Harbor Freeway a parking lot and paralyze 
the movement of traffic in the downtown area.

REPLY TO REALTOR

<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Heather Simms letter (Feb. 4) complaining about Robert J. Bruss' 
advice to sellers to only give a listing to a realtor for 30 days and to 
include a cancellation of listing clause if the agent is not doing his/her job, 
I am forced to wonder if these agents have ever worked for a living at all. 
</P>
<P>
Her point questioning "what contract of employment may be terminated at a 
moments notice?" betrays her lack of experience and knowledge of the workplace 
most of us are familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, employees are terminated with little or no advanced notice every 
day for incompetance, irresponsibility and low productivity. Are we to believe 
that no realtor has ever been guilty of these traits? 
</P>
<P>
Without the 30-day listing and cancellation clause what other recourse does the 
seller have? If her personal sales record is as good as she implies, why is she 
so threatened by such a contract? 
</P>
<P>
As for the money Simms' realty spends to promote listings, is this not normal 
business overhead that should be quickly repaid by high volume sales? 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, if a home is hard to show, if the house is untidy or asking price 
too high, who else but the realtor is at fault? Isn't this precisely their job 
to advise the client on these issues and if the client is uncooperative 
wouldn't the realtor just as soon lose such a time-waster in order to better 
concentrate on sellable listings?

STEP RIGHT UP: SEE A SPACE SHUTTLE ROCKET HIGH;

<P>
SPACE: WATCHING A SHUTTLE ROCKET SKYWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Courant. 
</P>

<P>
PORT CANAVERAL, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This state has its share of offbeat spectacles: gator wrastlin' in the 
Everglades. Conch-shell blowing in the Keys. Baseball in March everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But one of Florida's most stellar sights is the earthshaking, fire-belching 
blastoff of a space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Few can resist the chance to see a rocket burning toward the stars. The sheer 
majesty of a liftoff has caused truckers piloting 18-wheelers to stop dead in 
their tracks on Interstate 95. Night launches, in particular, draw viewers by 
the tens of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
But day or night, a scheduled launch is reason enough for visitors to make a 
detour to the Kennedy Space Center area on Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
Before every shuttle launch, and often before commercial rockets lift off from 
Kennedy Space Center, the parks, roadways and beaches of Titusville, Cocoa 
Beach and Cape Canaveral clog with spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Impromptu recreational vehicle encampments pop up along U.S. 1, parks fill at 
absurdly early hours and fast-food joints do land-office business. Souvenir 
hawkers make the rounds with T-shirts, caps, models and anything else that 
might sell. 
</P>
<P>
From every direction, binoculars are trained on the distant launch pad (several 
are used at Kennedy Space Center), where the shuttle lies pointing toward the 
sky and bathed in beams of bright light. 
</P>
<P>
Weather -- and whether it will permit a successful launch -- is often the major 
topic of conversation. On the clear night before the January launch of the 
Columbia the skies seemed promising, but forecasts were iffy. (Morning clouds 
would postpone the launch until the following day.) 
</P>
<P>
"There's a ring around the moon," said one elderly shuttle watcher, looking up 
at a cloud-circled moon. "That means something about the weather, but I forget 
what." 
</P>
<P>
Some spectators become instant experts on such arcana as the launch window (the 
precise time frame within which liftoff must occur), satellite deployment and 
recovery, and other space shuttle mission tasks. 
</P>
<P>
During the wait, portable TVs and radios are tuned to keep up with 
late-breaking developments at NASA's Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
Once the countdown begins in earnest, suspense sets in as all eyes turn to the 
launch area. As the countdown enters its final phase, the spectators join in. 
"5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . liftoff," they chant. 
</P>
<P>
First there is eerie silence, as if somebody forget to flip the switch. Then 
flames ignite the sky. Seconds later a dull roar rattles across the flats. The 
earth shudders. A barely seen craft rises, tracing a fiery parabola across the 
sky and trailing a smoky signature in its wake. The crowd cheers. Space shuttle 
Columbia has just lifted off. 
</P>
<P>
To see the launch, thousands had to first grapple with the question: Where to 
watch? 
</P>
<P>
Before choosing, they had to decide whether they wanted a glimpse of the rocket 
as it lifts off from the pad, or a good view of the booster rockets dropping 
off. And they had to select a site from among the literally hundreds of spots 
peppering more than 20 miles of beach front. 
</P>
<P>
Many seasoned spectators rate the booster drop the most impressive sight. And 
for that, the preferred spot is Jetty Park in Port Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
There, a ridge hides the liftoff but the rocket, once airborne, usually passes 
almost directly overhead and -- while still in sight -- drops its boosters over 
the Atlantic. (Just to put things in perspective, by the time you're back in 
your car, the shuttle might be flying over Africa.) 
</P>
<P>
Though the small park is a bit harder to find than some of the other viewing 
spots, and traffic is likely to hem you in a bit longer, the view is good 
enough to lure newspaper photographers from throughout Central and South 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Capacity at Jetty Park is limited to 500 or 600 cars, so arrive early. 
Campgrounds there are often already full with overnighters sleeping in tents or 
RVs. 
</P>
<P>
Those who would rather see the moment of liftoff should head for U.S. 1 in 
Titusville and get a parking spot there early. Binoculars are a must; the site 
is nearly 15 miles from the launch pad. The town allows parking along U.S. 1 
for 24 hours before a scheduled launch (RVs lined the road the night before the 
January liftoff of the Columbia). 
</P>
<P>
The best spots are south of the junction with Florida 402, especially Sand 
Point Park and Bird Watchers Park. Get into position at least two or three 
hours before launch time. 
</P>
<P>
The drawback to watching from Titusville is that after blasting off, the 
shuttle rocket often veers south and east away from you. 
</P>
<P>
Other hot spots for shuttle watching include sites along the Banana River, the 
waterway separating Cape Canaveral from mainland Florida, particularly on 
either side of the Florida 528 causeway. 
</P>
<P>
A somewhat more relaxed setting might be Cocoa Beach Pier, where you can settle 
back in a restaurant and watch the launch over a meal. 
</P>
<P>
If a shuttle launch doesn't fit into your vacation plans, or if you would like 
to learn a bit more about the space programs before seeing a liftoff, you can 
get in an appropriately starry state of mind at Kennedy Space Center's 
Spaceport USA. It's on the grounds of the Kennedy Space Center on Cape 
Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
Upon entering the park, visitors are greeted by a forestry grove of upright 
rockets. You will feel like a Lilliputian lost amid the massive Gemini-Titans, 
Atlas-Agenas, Deltas and Junos. 
</P>
<P>
Head to the numerous displays of space artifacts scattered throughout several 
buildings. Before getting too engrossed, buy tickets for the spectacular Imax 
movie "The Dream is Alive" and/or the Space Center bus tour. For either 
attraction, waits may be upward of two hours. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the display areas it is back to the dawn of the Space Age via 
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules, space suits, moon rocks and such. You will 
also get a glimpse of high-tech space spinoffs -- telecommunications, plastics 
and electronics gear that have changed the way we live. In one exhibit you can 
poke your head into the simulated cabin of a shuttle vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the displays, the Imax movie is the star of the Spaceport show. 
Shown on a 5 1/2-story screen, "The Dream is Alive" features stunning footage 
shot in space by astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
From its thundering takeoff scenes to the final walk-in-space sequences, this 
is the movie that truly portrays the sense of wonder in the exploration of 
space. 
</P>
<P>
You will see technicians cry with joy as rockets bound into the sky, watch 
astronauts cope with floating food and witness godlike vistas of planet Earth 
as seen from orbit -- all in incredible razor-sharp, big-as-life detail. 
</P>
<P>
The bus tours pale by comparison. There are two choices for this rather 
lifeless two-hour jaunt. One visits the sites of current manned missions, while 
the other provides a history of the early space program. Mostly what you will 
see are lots of huge utilitarian buildings and some outsize machinery. 
</P>
<P>
There are scheduled photo stops as well as stops at assorted displays. Though a 
shuttle was on the launch pad during a recent visit, even on the bus's closest 
approach the rocket-mounted shuttle was far too distant for a good picture and 
was completely obscured by the gantry, the metal framework that provides access 
to the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing the tours, you can stop in at Spaceport restaurants with such 
cutesie names as the Lunch Pad and the Orbit Cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can battle the crowds in the souvenir shop, vying for shuttle cups, 
mugs, pens, matches or patches. While you are there, you might grab an 
Astronaut Space Dinner (freeze-dried beef stew, corn and chocolate pudding) to 
sustain you on your own shuttle vigil. 
</P>
<P>
This promises to be a banner year for liftoff lovers as NASA embarks on its 
most ambitious program since the mid-'80s. This year the space agency will 
blast 10 shuttle vehicles into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
(Columbia lifted off Jan. 9; nine more launches are scheduled). 
</P>
<P>
The next launch is set for late February. There's another in late April. For a 
list of upcoming liftoffs, write to NASA, BOC-155, Kennedy Space Center, Fla. 
32899. 
</P>
<P>
Those who plan well in advance can write for a special pass permitting them 
onto Space Center grounds for the closest possible view of a launch (about 
seven miles from the launching pad). 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 free passes are issued for each launch date. They are parceled out 
on a first-come, first-served basis. Those who write now could, with luck, 
secure a space for a summer launch. For reservations or more information, write 
to NASA Vehicle Passes, PA-PAS, Kennedy Space Center, Fla. 32899.

HAPPY LANDINGS IN THE FIJI ISLANDS

SAVUSAVU, Fiji 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through the small window of one of the bright yellow commuter planes that fly 
between the Fijian islands, we watched the sun spotlight a large fish suspended 
in the crystalline water below. 
</P>
<P>
More scenes followed in quick succession as we lost altitude before landing: 
small mangrove islands, then reefs with lacy fringes of white foam, next placid 
lagoons, and finally thatch-roofed huts scattered on green hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
Fiji, a cluster of dots on the map about 1,000 miles north of New Zealand, is 
made up of 240 islands, including the two largest, Vanua Levu and Viti Levu. 
</P>
<P>
The islands seem magical -- lush peaks reaching into wispy clouds, thick stands 
of coconut palms, shorelines edged with white beaches that are lapped by some 
of the most seductive blue water in the world. 
</P>
<P>
This is where sailing, snorkeling, diving, beachcombing, sun worshiping, bird 
watching, horseback riding, bush hiking and just plain relaxing is an excellent 
way to spend a low-key vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Our destination was Vanua Levu, the second-largest island, and the pilot gently 
set the plane down on a grassy airstrip cut from the jungle. A bench under a 
broad mango tree serves as the official waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
We were met by a tall New Zealander who offered a cheery, "Bula! Welcome to 
Vanua Levu, mate." This was Curly, an emissary of Vanua Levu. "Bula" is the 
traditional "Hi, how are you?" in Fijian. 
</P>
<P>
We climbed into a Jeep and headed for Namale Plantation not far from the 
village of Savusavu. Ten thatch-roofed cottages called bures (boo-rays) offer 
comfortable beds and fresh flowers everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Namale is a working copra (dried coconut meat) plantation. It began operating 
in 1867 when the high chief of this part of Vanua Levu, Tui na Savusavu, traded 
with the British -- 10 muskets for 125 acres. 
</P>
<P>
In today's economy, however, tourism is more financially rewarding than the 
copra, so house guests are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical humidity is tempered by gentle trade winds carrying the mingled 
fragrances of orchids, bougainvillea and frangipani. Fruit trees are 
everywhere, as are small, colorful parakeets. At dusk, flying foxes (fruit 
bats) glide in to raid the pawpaw (papaya) trees. 
</P>
<P>
When the tide is out, the nearby reef is ready for exploration. Small pools 
come to life after you sprinkle them with a few cracker crumbs. A miniature 
world emerges of coral formations, sea urchins, limpets, wispy grasses and tiny 
fish, each with their own surprises. 
</P>
<P>
The unwritten code is not to remove anything from the tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
In Fijian villages everyone, it seems, is related by blood or marriage to a 
chief of ancient lineage. Even in modern Fiji the chiefs are greatly respected 
and their wishes are followed. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to Fiji must have a valid passport. When stamped upon entry it will be 
good for 30 days. Major credit cards are accepted at most hotels, restaurants 
and shops. 
</P>
<P>
The government center and capital of Fiji is Suva, which is worth a visit. 
</P>
<P>
Qantas Airlines flies three days a week from Los Angeles to Nadi International 
Airport. Call toll-free (800) 227-4500. Air New Zealand also flies out of Los 
Angeles three times a week. Call (800) 262-1234. 
</P>
<P>
Once in Fiji, inter-island flights are available on Fiji Air and Sunflower Air. 
</P>
<P>
Some guest houses on the outer islands may not be available through travel 
agents. If not, write to: 
</P>
<P>
Namale Plantation, P.O.Box 244, Savusavu, Vanua Levu, Fiji, about $115 U.S. 
double; Qamea Beach Club, P.O. Taveuni, Qamea, about $150 double, and Paddy 
Doyles Crow's Nest, P.O. Box 270, Sigatoka, Viti Levu, about $70. (Add 10% tax 
to all hotel rates.) 
</P>
<P>
All serve excellent food, which is not included in the cost of rooms. 
</P>
<P>
For food in Viti Levu, try Poon's on Nadi's main street. A Chinese dinner is 
about $7 U.S. For Indian curry, visit the Curry Corner just off Nadi's main 
road. The Crow's Nest restaurant serves good food amid a colorful collection of 
seagoing paraphernalia, including old brass diving gear.

A FOREST OF MEDIEVAL TOWERS GIVES SAN GIMIGNANO A SURREAL QUALITY 
</P>

SAN GIMIGNANO, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dante spoke here. 
</P>
<P>
He was serving as an emissary for his native Florence, but his fellow citizens 
voted to condemn him to death in absentia. Dante never returned home. 
</P>
<P>
The room where he spoke, known now as the Sala di Dante, is one of the chambers 
in the city museum in the city hall, which also houses a small collection of 
medieval masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
If you come to San Gimignano today, you may wonder how Dante ever found the 
place. Like a diamond lost in the rolling sea of hills in the province of 
Tuscany, San Gimignano seems like a surreal mirage. Yet it is real. 
</P>
<P>
Crowning a hill above silvery olive groves and verdant vineyards, San Gimignano 
looks almost as it did in Dante's time, its trademark towers and forbidding 
wall still intact. 
</P>
<P>
An independent city-state in 1199, San Gimignano's origins are obscure. The 
town may have been named after a local saint who, in the 6th Century, rescued 
the town from a barbarian horde led by a warlord name Tortila. 
</P>
<P>
According to legend, Gimignano stood on a battlement in a suit of armor that 
gleamed ethereally in the Italian sun. Tortila took the unearthly glow to be an 
omen from the gods, and fled. 
</P>
<P>
San Gimignano was saved. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gimignano may have saved the town from the barbarians, no one could 
save the citizens of San Gimignano from themselves. Like every other town in 
medieval Italy, San Gimignano split into warring factions known as Guelphs and 
Ghibellines. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Dante arrived to plead with the citizens of San Gimignano to side 
with the Guelphs, family feuds were as rampant as modern gang wars. 
</P>
<P>
The forest of towers that the noblemen or magnates built served as medieval 
versions of spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Each family manned its bastion to maintain constant surveillance on its 
neighbors. When the cold wars became hot, feuding families lobbed spears, 
rocks, flaming arrows and burning pitch at each other, occasionally 
incinerating large sections of the town. 
</P>
<P>
By 1348, a combination of family feuds and plague decimated San Gimignano, and 
in 1352 it was annexed by the neighboring city-state of Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 72 towers that once existed, only 15 are left. Only one, the Torre 
Grossa, a part of the city hall, is open to the public. From there you can scan 
the entire town, including the Romanesque cathedral or duomo, the austere 
Church of San Agostino, the ruins of the town castle, and the labyrinth of 
medieval streets. 
</P>
<P>
The city hall, or Palazzo Popolo, contains several important sights. The 
courtyard with its Renaissance-style arcade may remind you of the stage set of 
some of Shakespeare's comedies or "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
The museum in the town hall displays several early Italian masterpieces, 
including works by Lippo Lippi and de Bartolo. Lippo Memmi's "Maesta" dominates 
the Sala di Dante. 
</P>
<P>
Many visitors miss the frescoes in the antechamber, a comic strip tableau that 
shows an Italian princeling sharing a sort of medieval Jacuzzi with his lady 
love, a scene somewhat out of sync with the dolorous assortment of Madonnas and 
crucifixes in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
The 174-foot Torre Grossa was deliberately designed by the city authorities to 
be taller than any tower in town. By forbidding anyone to build anything 
higher, the city council hoped to stem the family squabbles that often 
threatened to destroy the city. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other towers in neighboring towns which are cramped and narrow, the 
stairway up the Torre Grossa is user-friendly, and anyone over six feet tall 
will appreciate this wide, well-lighted, commodious concession to the 20th 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Once you reach the top of the tower, you'll see why the burghers who built it 
found it such a strategic asset. You can spy on everyone in town, from St. 
Matthew Gate on one end to St. John's Gate on the other. You'll get a bird's 
view of secret terraced gardens, cloistered religious retreats, the ant-like 
crowds of tourists photographing each other in front of the cathedral. And if 
you're lucky, you may hear the strains of a chamber concert in the cathedral 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1460, the dark, quintessential Romanesque cathedral, or duomo, is 
next to the Palazzo Popolo. The walls are covered with frescoes, but you'll 
have to slip a few hundred lira into a coin machine to have them illuminated. 
</P>
<P>
On the left side of the church are scenes from the Old Testament by Bartolo di 
Fredi. On the right side, the New Testament by Barna da Siena, who later 
influenced major Siena artists such as Duccio and Martini. 
</P>
<P>
A grisly portrayal of Hell, worthy of Dante's Inferno, by Taddeo di Bartolo, is 
also on the right side of the church. Santa Fina's Chapel is off to the right 
as you enter and is decorated with frescoes by Ghirlandaio. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fina, a sort of local patron saint, was a 13-year-old damsel who lived in 
the 13th Century, and committed the sin of accepting an orange from a stranger. 
After Santa Fina's mother lectured her on the perils that such a fall from 
grace might precipitate, Santa Fina took to her bed, an oak board, and remained 
there until her death five years later. 
</P>
<P>
Once transformed into an angel, Santa Fina seemed to have led a rather eventful 
existence. She rescued a handsome young mason who fell from a scaffold while 
working on the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
As another young man entered church, Santa Fina exorcised a devil that had 
possessed him. Still in angel form, she rescued an entire ship that was about 
to capsize in a violent storm. 
</P>
<P>
These unusual facts are dutifully chronicled in the Museum of the Hospital and 
Pharmacy of Santa Fina, housed in the Church of San Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to learning more than you probably ever wanted to know about Santa 
Fina, you can see a rather peculiar mixture of miscellany: medieval 
pharmaceuticals, medicine jars and bottles and samples of medieval glass. 
</P>
<P>
Other sights include the ruins of the castle, known as La Rocca, where you can 
view the surrounding Tuscan countryside. If you are from California or the 
Southwest, the austere brick Church of San Agostino will remind you of the 
early Spanish missions built by the Franciscan padres. A trail around the town 
will give you an excellent panorama both of the ancient city wall and the 
countryside beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Gimignano's major sights are worth seeing, it's always important 
to remember that rushing from sight to sight is not the best way to savor San 
Gimignano. 
</P>
<P>
The most important sights here are the places you discover on your own. The 
best time to take a personal tour, especially during the high season in summer, 
is at sunrise before the hordes of tour buses arrive, or at sundown after the 
tour buses have left. 
</P>
<P>
At dawn, the light from the rising sun turns the austere stone facade of the 
cathedral and the city hall to a mellow gold. The nearby towers cast their long 
ominous shadows across the piazzas. 
</P>
<P>
The grim brick facade of San Agostino gives off an almost rosy glow, and if 
there has been a heavy dew during the night, wispy clouds of mist rise from the 
floors of the dozens of hills and valleys that surround the town. 
</P>
<P>
As the dawn deepens into day in the Piazza del Duomo, a cafe proprietor wipes 
off the marble bar and the air becomes full of the aroma of espresso. A few of 
the elderly and devout struggle slowly up the wide steps to the cathedral for 
early morning prayer. Doves circle overhead from perches high in the Torre 
Grossa or Torre Podesta across the square. 
</P>
<P>
This too is the time to wander down the brick and cobblestone side streets 
lined with 15th-Century row houses, flower pots and ivy-covered garden walls. 
</P>
<P>
Only evening rivals morning as the time that San Gimignano at its best. The 
Palazzo Popolo and the Palazzo Podesta are illuminated by dozens of lights. The 
villagers gather around the piazza to socialize, and San Gimignano assumes an 
almost magical aura. 
</P>
<P>
Try to avoid San Gimignano in August. It's hot, and its farmers build bonfires 
continuously, covering the rolling Tuscan countryside with an ugly, smoggy 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
If you are driving, San Gimignano is off the main network of Superstrada A-1. 
From Florence, take an extension of Superstrada A-1 in the direction of Siena. 
Exit at Poggibonsi. Make sure that you are taking the extension of A-1 and not 
A-1 itself, which leads to Rome. The town is about 40 miles from Florence, 
making it ideal for a day trip. 
</P>
<P>
By train, from Florence, take the train bound from Siena that will take you 
through Empoli to Poggibonsi. Get off at Poggibonsi and take the bus to San 
Gimignano. You'll need to buy a bus ticket at the tabacchi (tobacco counter) 
inside the rail terminal; you cannot buy a bus ticket aboard the bus. 
</P>
<P>
From other points: San Gimignano, like Siena, is on a side line that runs from 
Empoli in the north to Chiusi to the south. All trains that run between Pisa 
and Florence stop at Empoli. All trains that run from Florence to Rome stop at 
Chiusi. 
</P>
<P>
By bus: You can take a bus from Siena, which departs from the bus station next 
to San Domenico's cathedral. Buy a ticket at the ticket office before you board 
the bus. Because San Gimignano is even closer to Siena than to Florence, you 
can day-trip from there, too. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations: It is possible but difficult to find a place to stay during the 
high season, so reservations are almost a necessity, especially around July 2 
and Aug. 16, the two dates on which the Palio takes place in nearby Siena. 
</P>
<P>
San Gimignano takes the overflow from Siena and all rooms are likely to be 
booked. Hotels tend to be expensive, but several agencies specialize in 
inexpensive rooms. 
</P>
<P>
For hotel reservations: Ufficio Informazioni Turistiche, via S. Giovanni, 125 
San Gimignano, Italy 53037. 
</P>
<P>
For inexpensive rooms, try La Rocca, Via dei Fossi 35A, or Agencia d'Affari 
Simona, via San Giovanni 95. Prices are about $25 per room. 
</P>
<P>
Dining: One popular spot to eat in town is Ristorante La Stella, north of the 
duomo at Via San Mateo 77. Prices are reasonable, with a meal costing between 
$7 and $20. 
</P>

PORT OF HALIFAX OFFERS A MARITIME GOOD FEELING

HALIFAX, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A summer storm came swirling down, churning up leaves on the sidewalks and 
sending umbrellas tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
As sheets of rain obstructed the view, we sought shelter in the nearest 
building -- Halifax's central post office. There, a friendly security guard 
greeted all the familiar, wet faces passing through the stamp counters. He 
spotted us immediately; two unfamiliar faces glancing around. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, you," he called out. "You must look at the mosaic under your feet of 
the famous Bluenose racing schooner." 
</P>
<P>
Stepping back, we gazed at the blue-and-gold tiles designed in the shape of the 
sleek yacht, which until then seemed nothing more than fashionable artwork. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the replica of the original schooner moored at the Privateers' 
Wharf," the guard said proudly. "It's only a block away." 
</P>
<P>
Such is street life in Halifax, one of Canada's quaint, out-of-the-way 
provincial capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The warmth and friendliness of Nova Scotia is not lost here, but in a province 
known more for its craggy shoreline and hideaway inlets, Halifax is a haven for 
maritime history buffs. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled on a peninsula that forms a large natural harbor, Halifax is an 
ice-free port that is navigable year-round. As a result, the city is steeped in 
maritime marvels, not the least being the famous Bluenose. 
</P>
<P>
While walking along the renovated dock, we found the impressive Bluenose II 
resting peacefully in its berth. The 143-foot, two-masted schooner is a replica 
of the original built in 1921. The Bluenose plied the seas as a fishing ship, 
but her sleek design helped her win many international races. 
</P>
<P>
She was undefeated in 20 years of racing, and as a tribute, she was featured on 
a Canadian 10-cent silver coin. In 1946, the yacht met misfortune and sank off 
Haiti. The Halifax Herald proclaimed: "Her passing is a national sorrow; the 
ignominy of her death, a national shame." 
</P>
<P>
A replica of the Bluenose II was launched in 1963 and is permanently moored 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Life in Halifax begins at the wharf, a conglomeration of refurbished 
wood-and-stone buildings dating from 1800 to 1905. A waterfront boardwalk 
provides easy access to the many shops in the Historic Properties section. 
</P>
<P>
This is Halifax's original settlement, where pirates brought their cargo to 
peddle and store. Many of the buildings have been converted into tourist shops, 
boutiques, cafes, pubs and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Red Store, once used for shipping operations with its hipped roof and 
large hoistway dormers, is now the Nova Scotia Tourist Center. The center has a 
wide selection of books from Nova Scotian authors, who bring the province's 
history of French and English pioneers to life. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax's city tourist bureau is downtown, at the corner of Duke and Barrington 
streets. Free city maps are offered in front of the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax was first settled in 1749, when the British -- some 2,500 strong -- 
founded a military base here. The Halifax harbor was used as a British naval 
base during the American Revolution and the War of 1812. During both world 
wars, Halifax was a major supply center for ships heading to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Life in Halifax begins at the wharf, a conglomeration of refurbished 
wood-and-stone buildings dating from 1800 to 1905. A waterfront boardwalk 
provides easy access to the many shops in the Historic Properties section. 
</P>
<P>
In 1917, the biggest man-made explosion before the atomic bomb occurred when a 
French munitions ship, the Mont Blanc, carrying 4,000 tons of TNT, collided 
with the Imo in the harbor. Half of Halifax was laid to ruins and a reported 
2,000 died from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has never come under attack, it has not lost its military 
presence, with the majestic old compound on Citadel Hill standing over Halifax 
like a great protective wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Citadel's landmark is the Old Town Clock, which sits in stately fashion on 
an emerald green hillside in front of the fort. 
</P>
<P>
The clock, shipped from England in 1803, was designed by the garrison 
commander, the Duke of Kent. It still chimes the correct time, the bells 
echoing across the city. 
</P>
<P>
The star-shaped garrison of Citadel Hill was constructed between 1829 and 1861, 
and is the fourth fortress built on the site. The fort is open free to the 
public from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. during the summer, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from 
September to June. 
</P>
<P>
Guided tours, lasting about three quarters of an hour, are given by Canadian 
park rangers, who offer detailed accounts of the fort's past. 
</P>
<P>
A highlight of the tour is the ceremonial changing of the guards and a 
traditional gun salute, as well as the playing of bagpipes by members of the 
Scottish Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
Views from the fort's highest points are spectacular when looking across the 
harbor to Halifax's sister city of Dartmouth. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, St. Paul's Church -- constructed in 1750 -- is said to be Canada's 
oldest Anglican church. St. Paul's epitomizes the British influence here. 
Whereas Quebec City feels as French as a boulangerie, Halifax is as English as 
tea and crumpets. 
</P>
<P>
Especially during a rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
The best months to visit Halifax are June through October, when temperatures 
are mild. July and August are the warmest months, but September and October 
offer spectacular scenes of changing foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax is host this year to the World Ice Skating Championships March 5-12 at 
the downtown Metro Center. The event is the sport's premier competition outside 
of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Summer tourists can enjoy two major events -- Festival '90 and the 
International Buskers Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Festival '90 -- a celebration of Halifax's birthday -- runs from July 27 to 
Aug. 6. Activities include fireworks shows, an Irish dance festival, a jazz 
festival, an international town cryer competition and a beach party. 
</P>
<P>
The Buskers competition, from Aug. 9-18, features street performers such as 
jugglers, puppeteers and magicians who ply their trade day and night along city 
streets. Spectators select their favorite act at the week's end. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended accommodations: 
</P>
<P>
The Gerrard Hotel, 1234 Barrington St., is a beautiful Old English-style 
establishment within walking distance of most of the city's attractions. 
Although it has only nine rooms, the hotel also runs the Harvey House bed and 
breakfast inn in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms at either establishment are $43 U.S. for two with breakfast, $38 without. 
The hotel's breakfast is worth a special note; it's as good as any we found in 
the Maritimes. Call (902) 423-8614. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain View Guest House, 2138 Robie St., is inexpensive but offers only 
four rooms. It is just off the Halifax Commons, the city's largest park. Rates 
range from $18 to $26. Call (902) 422-4169. 
</P>
<P>
The Halliburton Inn, 1584 Morris St., is three restored Georgian-styled homes 
with 34 rooms. The inn is known for its afternoon teas and dinners. The owners 
are Buddhists from California and Colorado. Rates range from $57 to $78, with 
some suites between $96 and $113. Call (902) 420-0658. 
</P>
<P>
The Queen St. Inn, 1266 Queen St., a historic heritage home circa 1860, has six 
rooms, each decorated differently. Rates range from $26 to $35. Call (902) 
477-1674. 
</P>
<P>
The Cat and Fiddle Inn, 1946 Oxford St. Rates range from $25-$34. Call (902) 
422-3222. 
</P>
<P>
Across the harbor, Dartmouth also provides accommodations and is linked with 
Halifax by two bridges -- the MacDonald and the MacKay -- as well as an 
inexpensive ferry service that has been operating since the 1750s. 
</P>
<P>
In Dartmouth, try the Martin House, 62 Pleasant St. The inn overlooks the 
harbor. Rates range from $39-$51. Some suites for $65. Call (902) 469-1896. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous quaint fishing villages can be found within 20 miles southwest of 
Halifax on the Lighthouse Route 333, and a few offer inexpensive B&amp;Bs. 
</P>
<P>
Lovers Lane Inn and Cottages (Box 4, Site 31, RR No. 1, Tantallon, Nova Scotia 
BOJ 3JO), just beyond the Lighthouse Route, offer accommodations recommended by 
the Nova Scotia Tourist Bureau. Rates range from $26-$44. Call (902) 823-2670. 
</P>
<P>
The Seabright Bed and Breakfast inn (Seabright, Nova Scotia BOJ 3JO) has a 
private beach. Rates range from $31-$35. Call (902) 823-2987. 
</P>
<P>
As for food, Halifax offers international fare, though seafood is its 
specialty. Both the city center and Historic Properties section have a number 
of fine restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax also has one of the finest pub districts in Canada. Most of the 50 pubs 
serve hearty food at modest prices in the early evening. The pubs, which 
resemble some of London's finest, are concentrated along Argyle Street in 
downtown or in the Historic Properties section. Most are restored 19th-Century 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Halifax has an international airport about 25 miles northwest of the city, 
along Route 102. Air Canada is the only carrier servicing Los Angeles to 
Halifax daily. All flights have stopovers in Montreal or Toronto. Round-trip 
fares are about $465 plus tax. For more information, call toll-free (800) 
424-3687. 
</P>
<P>
Bus service in the city is good, but visitors should have access to a car to 
drive through the spectacular countryside. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact Tourism Halifax at (902) 421-6448 or the Nova 
Scotia Tourist Bureau, P.O. Box 130, Halifax, Canada B3J 2M7, (800) 341-6096 or 
(902) 424-5000.

YOUTH BEAT: UNLIMITED RAIL PASS FOR STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers now can buy a ticket valid for unlimited rail travel in Britain and 
France, plus return travel across the English Channel. An attractive feature of 
the pass is that travel on consecutive days isn't necessary for full value. 
</P>
<P>
The BritFrance Railpasses can be used on Britain's high-speed InterCity trains, 
and for travel aboard the world's fastest train, the French TGV. It's also 
valid for round-trip Hovercraft travel between Dover and Boulogne, or Dover and 
Calais. For the Hovercraft you must make seat reservations, a service that 
costs about $4. 
</P>
<P>
There are no youth or student rates for BritFrance passes, but there is an 
economy version with seats in second-class rail cars. A pass for economy-class 
travel on any five days throughout a 15-day period costs $199; for 10 days 
throughout a one-month period it's $299. Passes must be bought before leaving 
the United States. They're available through travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
Youth rates are offered for unlimited second-class rail travel in England, 
Scotland and Wales. The BritRail Youth Passes are available to travelers 
between 16 and 25 years. An eight-day pass costs $169, 15 days is $239, 22 days 
$309, and a one-month version $359. 
</P>
<P>
Last year a Flexipass version of the BritRail Youth Pass was introduced. A 
ticket valid for four days throughout an eight-day period costs $139. For 
travel any eight days in a 15-day period it's $199, and for any 15 days through 
a one-month period the cost is $289. BritRail Youth Passes must be bought 
through a travel agent before you leave home. 
</P>
<P>
If you'd rather not commit yourself to buying a rail ticket before your arrival 
in Britain, you can still take advantage of some discounts if you're the right 
age or on student status. 
</P>
<P>
The British Tourist Authority offers a student over 16 a Student Coach Card 
after arrival in Britain if he or she can provide proof of being a full-time 
student. The card, which costs 3.90 (about $6.75 U.S.), can be bought from 
National Express and Scottish City-link agents in England, Scotland and Wales, 
or at the Coach Travel Centre, 13 Regent St., London. 
</P>
<P>
The International Student Travel Conference advises that full-time students and 
non-students under 24 can buy a Young Person's Rail Card, which is honored for 
reductions of 33% to 50% on regular rail fares in Britain. The card most likely 
would be of best value to long-term visitors. The cost is 15, and the card is 
valid for one year. 
</P>
<P>
London travel agencies affiliated with the Student Travel Conference include 
Travel CUTS, 295A Regent St.; London Student Travel, 52 Grosvenor Gardens 
(opposite Victoria Station), and STA Travel, 74 Old Brompton Road. 
</P>
<P>
These offices also can supply information on reduced rates for travel from 
Britain to continental Europe. Services include budget bus travel and special 
point-to-point rail tickets that are available to travelers under 26. 
</P>
<P>
The rail tickets are called Transalpino, or Eurotrain, and are available for 
hundreds of European destinations in 22 European countries and Morocco. You can 
take up to two months to complete the journey. Some of the reduced rail tickets 
are for routes that circle back to London. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Eurotrain recently offered a ticket for travel from London to 
Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and back to London for $112. A ticket from London to 
Amsterdam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo, Cologne, Brussels and back to 
London was $305. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best sources for information on budget travel in Britain is the 
590-page, 1990 edition, of "Let's Go: Britain and Ireland" (Harvard Student 
Agencies, $12.95). 
</P>
<P>

Authority, 350 S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles 90071, (213) 628-3525.

In writing of the delights of Virginia's Shenandoah Valley (Jan. 28), Beverly 
Beyer and Ed Rabey once again neglect the train as a means of arriving at a 
delightful destination in a delightful way. Amtrak's Cardinal provides several 
access points to the Shenandoah Valley. Those who avail themselves of the 
Cardinal will witness the most beautiful U.S. scenery east of the Rockies.

EXCESS BAGGAGE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the excess baggage article by Peter Greenberg (Savvy Traveler, Jan. 
28): I was almost a victim of the overseas airline scam recently. When I flew 
from Los Angeles to New York and on to Morocco via Iberian Airlines, for my 
excess baggage of 70 pounds I paid $76. 
</P>
<P>
On my return trip, I learned from Iberia that an overnight in Madrid would be 
necessary, so I elected to transfer to Royal Air Maroc. By pure chance I asked 
the Air Maroc agent what the charge would be for the extra 70 pounds. I was 
told that it would be about $500 -- what I paid one way from Morocco to Los 
Angeles. Fortunately, I had two weeks before my departure to get over the shock 
and have the articles sent back by parcel post for $185. 
</P>
<P>
I believe it should be standard practice for travel agents as well as American 
airline companies to warn their customers of this nefarious practice.

FIVE AND COUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is eight years since I fulfilled a lifetime ambition with my first visit to 
the United States. I am enjoying my fifth, with a sixth planned for later in 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
My experiences have so far lived up to my expectations. The standard tourist 
guides are excellent value for the basics, but they can't beat local and 
contemporary information, whether by regular visits or by contact with a 
native. It is this information that has allowed me to meet more real Americans. 
</P>
<P>
If any of your readers have plans or thoughts of visiting the United Kingdom, I 
would welcome the opportunity to meet during my next visit for an exchange of 
information. It may be that clubs and associations would see this as an 
appropriate subject for one of their meetings, in which case I would be happy 
to formalize and illustrate my contribution, as required. I will reply to any 
correspondence received at 50 Lavender Ave., Coundon, Coventry CV6 1DB, 
England.

MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbus called this bay El Golfo de Buen Tiempo because of the fair weather he 
encountered, but 16th-Century Spaniards changed it to Bahia de Mantega, or 
"lard bay," because of their brisk trade in shipping the clarified fat. Somehow 
the unromantic latter name evolved into Montego Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The British arrived in 1655 and, with cannons blazing, routed the Spaniards. 
They held onto Jamaica until the island gained independence in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's economy hit the doldrums when the sugar and bauxite markets fell. 
Then the north coast came to the rescue with tourism, and this stretch of beach 
became the standard bearer. 
</P>
<P>
What captivated Columbus and countless visitors since him about this spot are 
its colors: ribbons of cobalt-aqua-turquoise water along the shoreline, endless 
white beaches fringed with lush green rain forest, flaming bougainvillea, 
poinciana and hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Air Jamaica nonstop, or Eastern, American or Northwest with 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Unless you're stopping at other Jamaican resorts, plan on at 
least a week to soak up plenty of sun and get into the laid-back life style. 
High-season lodging costs (mid-December until April 30) climb pretty high, but 
dining is a bargain year-round. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Jamaican dollar recently traded at 6.4 to ours, about 
15.6 cents each. Weather is balmy to hot all year, with October and May the 
wettest months. Even then, rains do not last long. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Gloucestershire (Gloucester Avenue; $105 to $125 
double, high season; $70-$90 low) is in midtown, just across the street from a 
very popular beach. Most of the hotel's 88 air-conditioned rooms have balconies 
overlooking the bay, and there's also a pool and Jacuzzi. The Gloucestershire 
puts you near the center of things, with a short walk to shops, restaurants and 
the town market. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Inn (Rose Hall; $128-$159 double, winter; $96-$118 summer) is a huge, 
eight-building complex with four dining rooms, half a dozen bar-lounges, 
enormous pool and its own beach. Nothing intimate about this one, but you'll 
find every activity under the sun here and tennis at night. There's also 
nightly dancing and entertainment. Bedrooms are generous in size, each with a 
balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Cariblue Beach Hotel (Ironshore; $75-$82 double winters; $55-$60 summers) is 
our budget special, an older and modest-but-comfortable place right on the 
water. Its King Arthur's restaurant and bar is a local gathering place, and 
you'll find it tough to beat these prices. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Read any menu in Jamaica and you're sure to see two 
staples: callaloo (spinach-like greens) and ackee, a rather bland pod fruit. 
The former is eaten straight, or made into hot or cold soups. Ackee mixed with 
salt fish (cod) comes close to being the national dish. 
</P>
<P>
Jerk pork or chicken gets its name from the distinct preparation: the meat is 
scored, ladled with a paste made of ground scallions, hot pimento pepper and 
thyme, allowed to marinate, then barbecued slowly. The glorious results are 
unlike any meat you've ever tasted. If you wish to try making it at home, pick 
up a jar of Busha Browne's jerk seasoning and give it a go. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica's Red Stripe beer is the perfect drink with jerk pork, and Appleton's 
rum is the island's finest. 
</P>
<P>
No mention of Jamaican potables is complete without several kudos to its Blue 
Mountain and High Mountain coffee. We picked up a pound each of the Martinez 
brand, which you'll find in gourmet shops at home. 
</P>
<P>
Fine dining: Stop in at the Pork Pit for your introduction to a super-heated 
version of jerk pork, chicken and fish, all eaten outside at long tables 
beneath the trees. 
</P>
<P>
The Pelican (Gloucester Avenue) has a coffee-shop atmosphere but excellent 
seafood. Its Cascade Room is more formal, with candlelight and waterfalls right 
outside the picture windows. Start with the smoked marlin or conch chowder, 
then have a go at one of the five lobster dishes. They also serve a wonderful 
curried goat, an island favorite. 
</P>
<P>
The Georgian House (2 Orange St.) is a restored 18th-Century town house that is 
all elegance and grace. Dine in the lovely garden courtyard or among gleaming 
brass chandeliers and hurricane lamps, period furnishings, beautiful place 
settings and flowered draperies. A rather short menu offers select seafoods, 
plus such temptations as tournedos Rossini. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Half-Moon Club (Rose Hall; $240-$340 double, winter; 
$156-$180 summer) sits on 400 acres strung out along a mile of curving beach. 
The architecture and furnishings are a fetching mixture of an early Jamaican 
plantation house and 18th-Century English, with lots of white wicker furniture, 
Queen Anne reproductions and marvelous Jamaican art works. 
</P>
<P>
Most rooms are within 20 feet of the beach. There's a Robert Trent 
Jones-designed golf course and a dozen tennis courts on the property, plus a 
spa-gym, horseback riding and water sports. 
</P>
<P>
Take your evening meal on a broad terrace under an 80-year-old seagrape tree. 
Then get ready for a night of dancing, reggae music and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Schenke is both proprietor and chef de cusine of the Sugar Mill restaurant 
on the Half-Moon Club's golf course. Hans' kitchen takes the best and freshest 
of Jamaican ingredients and gives them a continental flair, such as perch 
poached in Vouvray wine and topped with an ackee sauce. His bar also whips up a 
Club House Special made with four kinds of rum camouflaged by fresh fruit 
juices. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: After your quota of beach time and water sports, take a morning 
trip to the produce and crafts markets, where native "higglers" bring their 
wares from outlying areas to sell to town folks and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Surely make time for a visit to Rose Hall, an 18th-Century "great house" once 
presided over by the infamous Annie Palmer, the "White Witch of Rose Hall," who 
legend says murdered three husbands (poison, stabbing and strangulation), took 
slaves as her lovers and murdered them as well when she tired of their favors. 
Enthusiastic Rose Hall docents will give you other gory details. 
</P>
<P>
If the reggae songs of Burning Spear, Jimmy Cliff, Tiger or Steel Pulse turn 
you on, you'll find the best music at Disco Inferno, Sir Winston or Rumours, 
starting very late at night. 
</P>
<P>

write (3440 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1207, Los Angeles 90010) for a brochure on 
Jamaica, including Montego Bay, and a map of the island if you request it.

FORSMAN RIDES OUT THE WIND; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: AS GUSTS CARRY SCORES HIGHER, HE SHOOTS PAR 72 TO TAKE TWO-SHOT LEAD OVER 
ARMOUR. MORE BAD WEATHER EXPECTED FOR TODAY'S FINAL ROUND.

<P>
What nature gave away the first two rounds, she took back with a fury Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of sunny, cool and relatively calm conditions, the wind kicked 
up and took the scores with it Saturday in the third round of the $900,000 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
While it took two under par just to make the 36-hole cut Friday, only eight of 
87 players broke par 72 on the South Course on a day of cloudy skies, some 
drizzle and plenty of wind. 
</P>
<P>
Ten more golfers managed par, and one of them, Dan Forsman, was able to hold 
his game together enough to take a two-shot lead. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman's 72 left him at 13-under 203, two ahead of Tommy Armour III, who made 
birdies on two of the final four holes to salvage a 73. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased to get around in par," said Forsman, who finished 99th on 
the 1989 money list. "I'm not the best wind player. I went into the day a 
little bit uneasy. I woke up a couple times in my hotel room and heard the wind 
blowing outside. I didn't sleep well after that. 
</P>
<P>
"This round wasn't fun; it was a survival test." 
</P>
<P>
At least Forsman was able to find a way to stay even in what were taxing 
conditions for golf. Because, after two days of easy scoring, most players 
found their scores going the other way. Few of the reversals were more costly 
than that which befell Bob Eastwood, who led Forsman by a stroke at the 
tournament halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood, who set a Torrey Pines' 36-hole record of 130, shot a 40 on the front 
nine and finished with a four-over 76, leaving him alone in third place, three 
strokes behind Forsman, at 206. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult to do anything out there," Eastwood said. "You just 
tried to hold your balance and make a good solid golf shot. And I didn't hit 
too many good golf shots." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone cursed the shift in weather conditions. For a few, the change 
in weather brought a change in fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara, whose four victories at Pebble Beach Golf Links (three as a tour 
member) attest to his seaside course abilities, shot a low-round 67. That moved 
him into a tie for fourth at 207 with Craig Stadler, who had one of four 70s in 
the round. O'Meara, who started Saturday in a tie for 32nd, 10 strokes behind 
leader Eastwood, opens today four behind Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it, and I'm not saying that because I hit 67," said O'Meara, a 
resident of Escondido. "I told my caddy going down the first hole that these 
are absolutely perfect conditions. I was so far behind the leader to start the 
day, the only chance I had was to shoot a 66-65, regardless of what the weather 
was like. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I saw the weather, I knew if I shot two or three under, that would 
put me in position where if I shoot a good score (Sunday) I have a chance to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The conditions on the front nine were especially tricky. With most of the holes 
sitting atop exposed ocean cliff, the wind blew without a break in gusts up to 
25 m.p.h. Complicating matters further were the gusts' uncharacteristic 
southerly direction. Usually the wind at Torrey Pines blows off the ocean; the 
shift meant the players often found themselves in the unsettling position of 
playing with the wind at their backs one hole and in their faces the next. 
</P>
<P>
It made for a day of 370-yard drives with the wind, like the one that left 
Forsman a sand wedge second shot on the 499-yard, par-five 18th. Contrast that 
with the three-iron into the wind O'Meara hit on the 404-yard fifth that 
travelled only 140 yards. Strangely, both made birdie, as Forsman routinely 
two-putted and O'Meara holed an 80-foot pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good break because I was just short of the bunker," O'Meara said. "I 
chipped it, but I had too much speed. It hit the pin in the middle and went in; 
that set the tone for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very demanding out there, very trying. You have to have a lot of 
patience. You have to realize that par is a good score." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be true today, as conditions for the final round might be worse. 
A steady rain began to fall shortly after play concluded, and more rain is 
predicted, along with wind, cool temperatures and overcast skies. 
</P>
<P>
That normally might send Forsman into a pre-round worry, but his round Saturday 
calmed his nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"This round goes a long way to showing me I can play in the wind," Forsman 
said. "That is something I needed." 
</P>
<P>
And something he might need again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere was the effect of the wind more clear-cut than in the driving distance 
statistics kept by the PGA Tour. Two holes were designated Saturday -- the 
fourth and the ninth. The 447-yard fourth played with the wind at the players' 
backs, and it produced some prodigious drives. Duffy Waldorf had the longest 
one at 363 yards, one yard better than Bill Sander. . . . Driving into the wind 
on the 537-yard ninth, Waldorf managed 235, Sander 254. . . . Steve Pate, the 
1988 champion from UCLA, and Mike Allen were both assessed a two-stroke penalty 
after they hit each other's balls on the 12th fairway. Neither realized his 
error until Pate had putted out, said their playing partner, Craig Stadler. 
Pate and Allen had to replay their second shots. Pate wound up with a 
triple-bogey seven and Allen a six.

YUMA'S CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TO THE FOLKS ON THIS SIDE OF THE LOCKOUT, WHO'S RIGHT AND WHO'S WRONG

YUMA, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one has ever accused this place of being paradise. Yet not since the 
territorial prison closed and lynching went out of fashion has this town been 
engulfed by such an ugly mood. 
</P>
<P>
It's a time of year when townsfolk here are proud to be Yumans, but you can't 
step inside a restaurant or bar these days without listening to them grieve. 
</P>
<P>
A cold snap has hit the city, dropping the overnight lows to 30 . . . the price 
of tomatoes has reached $2.99 a pound . . . Yuma High School was upset in the 
first round of the divisional basketball tournament . . . even hard drugs have 
infiltrated the town, with a man sentenced just Thursday for possession of four 
Salem cigarettes laced with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"People are pretty upset right now," said Joe Catonzaro, 32, an airport 
manager. "Everyone's blaming our problems on one thing, and only one thing, and 
it's making us pretty damn mad." 
</P>
<P>
Yes sir, one look at the marquee at the Ray Kroc Baseball Complex these days 
lets everyone in town see what they already know to be the root of all their 
ills. 
</P>
<P>
Standing high above the ground for all of Yuma to see, the marquee for god's 
sake, is publicizing a tool sale, a gun show and an Italy travelogue. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere to be found are the words: San Diego Padres Spring Training. 
</P>
<P>
"It's enough to make you sick," said Bill Kreitler, 35, manager of the Hungry 
Hunter restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Yuma's most prominent residents, the ones who live there six weeks every 
spring, are nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres remain at home with the rest of baseball's 26 major league teams, 
locked out of spring training until a settlement is reached on a collective 
bargaining agreement between the owners and the players. 
</P>
<P>
The townsfolks don't know who's right or who's wrong in the stalled 
negotiations between players and owners, nor do they much care. They just 
continue reading the local sports section and watching the news religiously, 
hoping to find anything that hints the Padres will be coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know who's at fault here," said Jack Mielke, owner of Jack and 
Rosie's steakhouse, "but I know Yuma's going to take the brunt of it. We're 
going to be the ones suffering." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres originally were due in town Saturday to report for spring training, 
with their first scheduled workout today in front of hundreds, perhaps a 
thousand, gleeful fans. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, 70 rooms at the Park Inn International hotel, the Padres' 
headquarters, have been freed up until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
The only ones using the ball park these days are the Padre minor league players 
and the Yakult Swallows, a Japanese professional team. The Padre clubhouse 
remains virtually empty, used only by a handful of minor league coaches, with 
two clubhouse attendants living in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bob Tippett says it's too early for anyone to panic, but already there 
are signs of economic catastrophe, and everyone is being hit. 
</P>
<P>
"Doomsday is not here," he said, "but we are very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The city has already cancelled "Meet the Padres Night," an affair sponsored by 
the Caballeros de Yuma, the city's booster group. Total estimated loss: 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' annual intra-squad benefit game, scheduled for Feb. 25, is not 
cancelled but now has evolved into a game between the Swallows and the Padres' 
minor league players. The benefit game still will cost $2 for admission and 
parking, but no one is expecting the usual crowd of 4,000 to watch the hitting 
exploits of Kazushigee Nagashima and Alberto Mateos instead of Tony Gwynn and 
Jack Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Keep it a secret from these distraught Yumans, but it's now almost a certainty 
that the first week of spring-training games will be cancelled, costing the 
Caballeros an estimated $119,200 in revenue from the games alone. 
</P>
<P>
You see, although a possible settlement could be reached next week, baseball 
officials said that camps probably won't open until at least a week later, 
providing time for equipment and players to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think we'd need at least 10 days of workouts before we could start 
playing games," said Jack McKeon, Padre manager and vice president of baseball 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city of Yuma can only wait, hope, and pray. 
</P>
<P>
Each day of the lockout is costing this town thousands of dollars, and although 
it's too depressing to Tippett to sit down and calculate the exact amount each 
day, a study has recently been completed to project the total loss of revenue 
for complete cancellation of spring-training. 
</P>
<P>
"It's eight million dollars," Tippett said, "and for a city like ours, that 
loss would be devastating." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Todd Craig, owner of The Crossing Restaurant, typified every Yuma 
businessman's sentiments when he said, "You know, I used to love the game of 
baseball. Now I hate it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HEY BUDDY, CAN YOU SPARE A QUARTER? 
</P>
<P>
Drew Parra grimaces as the two Marines leave their bar stools. He scrapes the 
change off the counter top, drops it into his tip container, and scowls when he 
examines the contents. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there are a few scattered dollar bills, but unless he plans to spend his 
free time playing video games, the quarters represent nothing more than chump 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a military town," he said, "and you know these Marines don't tip. You 
can't find too many people in town who do. In this town, they think tipping is 
a town in China." 
</P>
<P>
Parra, who has been bartender at the Shilo Inn the past four years, normally 
could shrug off his disgust. After all, Valentine's Day has passed, and in this 
town that means only one thing: 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, with their $51.50 worth of meal money each day and fat checkbooks, 
soon will be rolling into town ready to saturate Yuma's economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Parra, along with every bartender, waitress, restaurant owner, hotel 
manager and businessman in town, knows this year is different. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just killing us," Parra said. "This is our biggest time of year. I 
mean, once they leave here, that's the last time we'll have any business until 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"Every businessman in town counts on this month." 
</P>
<P>
And just how much more can Parra usually expect to receive in tips when the 
Padres are in town? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather not say," Parra said. 
</P>
<P>
Three hundred? 
</P>
<P>
"More." 
</P>
<P>
Five hundred? 
</P>
<P>
"More." 
</P>
<P>
One thousand? 
</P>
<P>
"You're getting closer, but that's all I'm going to say." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Parra confesses, once Goose Gossage left the Padres, everyone's 
wallet suffered. 
</P>
<P>
"Goose would just sit here with a stack of twenties and order Cuervo Gold and 
Miller Lite's," Parra said, his eyes glistening thinking back to the good ol' 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all curious to see what it'd be like this year, because last year, 
they cooled it a little bit. They had a new manager (McKeon), and I guess they 
wanted to make a good first impression. 
</P>
<P>
"But before, man, they partied big time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
I JUST WANT A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP 
</P>
<P>
Gail Larsen, the reservationist at the Park Inn International where the Padres 
are supposed to stay, has 70 rooms awaiting the Padres for Friday, Feb. 23. It 
has been no problem pushing the reservations back a week from the original 
schedule, but any further delay, she says, could be a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is booked solid throughout March, but if spring training is delayed, 
and that first week of games is cancelled, she expects the hotel to become a 
ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
"We figure about 95 percent of our 164 rooms are filled with Padre players and 
fans," she said. "Everyone wants to stay here so they can rub elbows with the 
players. And so far, we haven't had one single solitary cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"But if this thing is delayed any longer or, God forbid, spring training is 
cancelled, I'll have a screaming fit. I'm having a headache as it is, because I 
really don't know what rooms I have to sell, and what rooms I don't. This whole 
thing is driving me goofy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what: If they don't get this thing settled, I'm going to take 
the next month and a half off to get psychiatric help." 
</P>
<P>
Total expected loss of revenue per night in hotel rooms alone at the Park Inn 
International: $10,500. 
</P>
<P>
But while this spring-training drought might be leading every hotel owner to 
the closest watering hole to drown his or her depression, there are some 
visitors who look positively at the surplus of rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm glad the Padres aren't here," said a man who called himself only 
Prosper, hoping to con a few of the local citizens to play pool with him at 
Johnny's Other Place. "I'm staying at the Motel 6 now, but if the Padres were 
here, man, I'd be sleeping on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HEY, GUYS, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO COME . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tippett sits in the stands of the empty Desert Sun Stadium, admiring the recent 
work of the Caballeros, of which he is president. The Caballeros have spent 
$140,000 out of their own pockets the past few months to renovate the complex, 
putting in a new outfield fence, a new warning track, a backstop, foul poles 
and electrical outlets behind the pitching mounds for pitching machines, among 
other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first stage of a $2 million project, Tippett said, in which they will 
provide the Padres with new locker room facilities, a new office complex and 
other amenities to keep the Padres in town. 
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, everything is being put on hold while the club is being 
sold. Tippett doesn't want to take the chance of making the improvements and 
having the new owner take the Padres out of Yuma when their lease expires in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a time where we can show off," Tippett said, "being one of just 26 
cities that can boast it has a major league team. But there's not a whole lot 
to brag about right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wish this whole thing would get settled. At least, I wish we could have 
the guys here working out." 
</P>
<P>
Tippett stopped, then came across what he perceived to be a brilliant idea. 
Hey, the Ray Kroc Complex is a public facility, isn't it? It's unconstitutional 
to keep anyone from using a public facility, isn't it? No one's seen a security 
guard around, have they? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm not going to be the one to tell Tony Gwynn he can't use our batting 
cages," Tippett said, smiling coyly. "He's more than welcome. He can bring his 
friends, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HEY GUYS, RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE THE SHOW 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, there is Tom Romenesko, the Padre director of player development. 
There's Priscilla Oppenheimer, administrator of minor league operations. And, 
oh yeah, Whitey Wietelmann and Bob Doty of the clubhouse staff. That's it, as 
far as the Padres' major league personnel in Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
Joining them Monday will be McKeon, Bill Beck, assistant to McKeon, and 
secretary Linda Barron, but all others from the Padre front office are 
forbidden in camp by directive of the owners' Player Relations Committee. Even 
Doc Mattei, the Padre traveling secretary, was forced to leave the camp 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is the uncertainty of what's going on," Romenesko said. "I 
must get asked 15 times a day about the latest in negotiations, and I tell them 
I know as much as anyone else, just what I read in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"The only advantage I can see now is that the laundry gets done quicker." 
</P>
<P>
Said Doty: "There's not a whole lot I can do right now but just wait, like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, fans are relegated to watching the Japanese and Padre minor 
leaguers. Few bother with the opportunity. On Friday, there were a total of six 
fans in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest group is the Japanese media, which has 82 reporters and 
photographers in camp to scrutinize their team's spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always like this," said Luigi Nakajima, an executive with Yakult. "We 
finished fourth last year, but we're very popular." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm, so do the baseball fans in Japan also become irate when there's a lockout? 
</P>
<P>
"What's a lockout?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but like the folks in Yuma say, you don't want to know.

ROLLING HILLS RALLY FALLS SHORT IN 3-AA PLAYOFFS 
</P>

<P>
The curtain fell on Rolling Hills High School's basketball season Friday night, 
but not before the Titans staged one last exciting production. 
</P>
<P>
Outmanned and outplayed for most of the game, Rolling Hills came back from a 
12-point, fourth-quarter deficit to throw a scare into visiting Western High of 
Anaheim, pulling within one point with 21 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, though, a scare was all the Titans could muster as No. 4-seeded 
Western held on for a 79-76 victory to avenge a two-year-old loss and reach the 
quarterfinals of the CIF Southern Section 3-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it our best shot," Rolling Hills Coach Cliff Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
That they did. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans got the ball into the right player's hands for their final shot, but 
a desperation three-pointer by Steve Clover from about 26 feet glanced off the 
rim. It wasn't the way Warren had pictured the ending. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he would hit a three-pointer, get fouled and make a four-point 
play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to expect a miracle after Clover's previous basket. 
</P>
<P>
Guarded closely by two players, the state's three-point king drilled a trey 
from about 22 feet to draw Rolling Hills within 77-76 with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Titans screwed up. 
</P>
<P>
After calling a timeout with 19 seconds left, Rolling Hills failed to foul 
quickly and Western got the ball up court to unguarded Steve Siefkin, who hit a 
layup with 13 seconds left to build the lead back to three. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a breakdown," Warren said. "I wanted a foul right away, but we couldn't 
get one." 
</P>
<P>
With a weapon like Clover, it's difficult to ever call Rolling Hills out of a 
game. The 6-foot-4 senior, bound for Pepperdine, ended his prep career with 27 
points on nine-of-22 shooting and seven three-pointers. He holds state records 
for most three-pointers in a career (288), season (140) and game (11). 
</P>
<P>
"He's dangerous," Western Coach Greg Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared doubtful that Clover would be able to get any shots off late in the 
game after picking up his fourth foul in the last second of the first half on a 
controversial call. But he managed to play the entire second half without 
another infraction. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Hendrix, the Titans' 6-6 junior center, led all scorers with 32 points, 
and junior guard Chad Heitzler added 11, including seven in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Western's victory avenged a one-point loss to Rolling Hills in the second round 
of the 3-A playoffs two years ago. In that game, a Western player blew an 
uncontested layup at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
The loss also prevented Rolling Hills from reaching the quarterfinals for the 
first time in five seasons under Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the game Friday morning, Warren sensed his team would have its hands 
full. 
</P>
<P>
"(Western) plays tenacious man-to-man defense and they pound the boards, all 
the things we don't do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Western's full-court press forced Rolling Hills into numerous turnovers, and 
the Pioneers' high-scoring trio of forward Robbie Shelton (27 points, 17 
rebounds) and guards Tom Barraza (24 points, 10 assists) and Sam Sabarra (18 
points) did a good job of attacking the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman, Western's coach, paid Warren a nice compliment after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it a great honor to beat a team coached by Cliff Warren," he said. 
"I consider him one of the greatest coaches in California." 
</P>
<P>
This marked the first season Rolling Hills failed to reach 20 wins under 
Warren, but 16-12 isn't bad for a team that lacked athletic ability and depth. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was one of Warren's better coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
His five-year record at Rolling Hills stands at 108-33 overall and 12-5 in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Poor depth and a lack of physical talent weren't the only obstacles that 
Rolling Hills faced this season. 
</P>
<P>
Although Warren tried to keep it a secret so his opponents wouldn't know, 
Clover was bothered by bronchitis and had vaporizer treatments before nearly 
every game. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been on some kind of machine," Warren said. "It's better I don't know 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay has five basketball teams remaining in the Southern Section 
playoffs and two in the L.A. City Section playoffs after Friday's games. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery (16-7), which posted a 59-51 victory over Buena Park in the 
Southern Section 4-A Division, travels to meet second-seeded San Marcos of 
Santa Barbara (22-6) in the quarterfinals Tuesday night at Dos Pueblos High in 
Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA Division, top-seeded Morningside (24-3), a 101-56 winner over 
Azusa, faces the winner of Saturday night's Atascadero-Lompoc game. The game 
was postponed from Friday because of a power outage at Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
In 2-A quarterfinals, El Segundo (14-13) faces No. 4-seeded Orange Lutheran 
(16-10) at West Torrance High, and Miraleste (14-11) meets No. 3-seeded St. 
Joseph of Santa Maria (17-7) at Rolling Hills High in games Tuesday night. 
Miraleste advanced with a 67-64 overtime win over Serra. 
</P>
<P>
Chadwick (18-8), an 81-64 winner over Capistrano Valley Christian, plays host 
to top-seeded Mission Prep of San Luis Obispo (17-4) in a 1-A game. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. City 4-A playoffs resume Wednesday night with quarterfinal-round 
games. Pacific League champion Carson (19-8), a 53-52 winner over Palisades, 
plays a rematch with visiting Dorsey (19-6), which it defeated in conference 
play. Westchester (16-10), which edged Narbonne, 58-57, plays at No. 2-seeded 
Crenshaw (20-4), an old nemesis for the Comets. 
</P>
<P>
A season-high 37 points from forward Tate Seefried helped El Segundo beat 
Crossroads, 81-67, in the second round of the 2-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Seefried, a 6-3 senior transfer who has been up and down this season, hit 11 of 
15 shots from the floor, including four three-pointers, and made 11 of 14 
free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was unconscious," El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky said. 
</P>
<P>
Center Kenny Talanoa added 11 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's collegiate signings were not limited to the area's football 
standouts. 
</P>
<P>
Six players from Mira Costa's state Division I girls volleyball champion team 
signed letters of intent with major colleges and four others have been offered 
scholarships, including three seniors on the junior varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
Setter Piper Hahn and middle blocker Heidi Eick, two of Mira Costa's three 
All-Americans, signed with Stanford. The third, middle blocker Kristal Attwood, 
committed to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs' two other senior starters, outside hitters Rainy Chrisman and 
Erika Lawson, signed with Pepperdine. Back-row specialist Jennifer Streatfield 
chose Washington.

TREVI HIBSMAN IS SAVVY SKATER, TOP SCORER ON BOYS TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
YOUTH HOCKEY: OPPONENTS TRY TO INTIMIDATE THE RANCHO PALOS VERDES TEEN-AGER, 
BUT HER TEAMMATES RETURN CHECK FOR CHECK -- AND SO DOES SHE.

<P>
Were it not for the long brown hair cascading from under a white helmet onto 
the shoulders of an oversized red jersey, it would have been impossible to tell 
Trevi Hibsman apart from her male teammates. Like all youth players of the Bay 
Harbor Minor Hockey Assn., Hibsman wore protective clothing: a cage over her 
face and assorted hip, elbow and shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no mistaking her skating savvy during a chilly early Sunday 
morning practice session recently at Olympic Ice Arena in Harbor City. First, 
she took a teammate to the ice on a puck drill. Later, the Rancho Palos Verdes 
teen-ager out-sticked another for the puck. 
</P>
<P>
When needed, her coach, John Mepham, said afterwards, Hibsman can also throw a 
pretty good hip check. 
</P>
<P>
"She is totally dedicated. Hockey is not a (temporary) craze with her," 
explained Arena owner John Marshall, who has watched Trevi grow up at the rink. 
"Those are the best ones. There should be more (like her)." 
</P>
<P>
Hibsman, 13, is one of six girls of various ages playing hockey on boys' teams 
at the Harbor City rink. She is, arguably, Bay Harbor's most accomplished 
female player, following a path blazed by her older sister, Tina, in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Trevi Hibsman, who plays in the wing position, leads her Pee Wee C Division 
team in scoring in a league composed of teams from all over Southern 
California. She has posted six more goals than any of her male teammates, and 
her consecutive point string has reached nine games. A few weeks ago she 
recorded her first hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
At Miraleste High School, where she is the eighth-grade student body president, 
she is known simply as "Hockey Girl." 
</P>
<P>
"I love everything about hockey," said Hibsman, whose 5-foot-5 frame and soft 
features would appear to lend themselves more to modeling than to a 
rough-and-tumble sport. 
</P>
<P>
Hibsman stepped onto the ice at age 7. "I did gymnastics for a couple of 
months," she said. "There wasn't much to it, just a few little tricks. It 
didn't keep me going." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Tina, now studying pre-med at UC Riverside, older brothers Ted, 26, and 
Tim, 23, also played at Bay Harbor. Said their father, Ed Hibsman, who has 
spent 20 seasons with his children at Bay Harbor: "It's an incredible 
experience for Trevi to play in this co-ed thing, to be playing in a man's 
world." 
</P>
<P>
There are few ways of comparing Trevi Hibsman's accomplishments nationwide. 
Most females who play ice hockey are segregated from the males. Hockey USA, 
published semi-weekly in Stoughton, Ma., devotes at least a page in each issue 
to girls' and women's standings and results. The National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. sponsors women's ice hockey championships in Division I and III. 
</P>
<P>
But in ice-starved Southern California, there is hardly enough time for youth 
hockey at the handful of rinks scattered between San Diego and Santa Barbara. 
For that reason, said Coach Mepham, few girls here attempt to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We have limited ice time here. That's something Pop Warner football or Little 
League parents never face," Mepham said. "Back East it is not the same. In 
Southern California, (kids like Trevi) endure for the love of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
So Trevi and the five other girls who play at Bay Harbor play on boys' teams, 
which presents some interesting situations. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some degree of harassment (by other teams) because she is a girl," 
Mepham said of Hibsman. "And because she is doing so well. Boys don't mind 
being beaten by boys, but they take it personal if they get beat by a girl." 
</P>
<P>
On more than one occasion Hibsman has been checked hard against the boards. She 
has been jeered. Spectators stare at the hair flowing from under her protective 
headgear, partially covering the name on the back of her jersey. One boy told 
her to get off the ice and go back to where girls belong. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ed Hibsman: "Some teams go out and say, 'Let's go get the girl.' " 
</P>
<P>
In that case, retaliation by her teammates is swift, Mepham said. "If Trevi 
gets checked on the board, her teammates might go after the guy who did it." 
</P>
<P>
Because most of the players on the Pee Wee team have skated at Bay Harbor for 
years, the boys act like big brothers with Trevi. In the locker room, said Ed 
Hibsman, "they just pile in, and she's in the corner with them. They are kind 
of like old buddies." 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Matt Kopeikin is the team's enforcer, according to Mepham, and he 
often comes to Trevi's aid. 
</P>
<P>
"She likes me to go after (guys who check her)," Kopeikin said. "I don't like 
to see her picked on just because she is a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Mepham pointed out that Hibsman can handle herself. "She may not agree with 
this, but she is a pretty good checker too." 
</P>
<P>
Hibsman said she has rarely been intimidated on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the boys on other teams go out to get me, but most of them try to be 
nice," she said. "They don't hit me too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Hibsman's main strength, her coach said, is finesse. 
</P>
<P>
"She thinks good hockey, and that is reflected in (the number of) her goals," 
Mepham said. 
</P>
<P>
Hibsman agreed: "If somebody checks me, I go after them. But I am more of a 
thinking player." 
</P>
<P>
Having a girl on the ice actually complements the boys' play, Ed Hibsman said. 
</P>
<P>
"With boys, I don't know whether it is hormones or what, but they want to go 
chase that puck. Trevi plays position hockey, much better than most boys. She 
let's the boys do the work and gets in position to take the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Trevi Hibsman said she followed her brothers and sister into hockey because "I 
wanted to do something different. I like the attention I get." 
</P>
<P>
She has few illusions that she can make a career of the sport after she leaves 
high school. That might require a move to the East Coast, which she thinks is 
unlikely, although she will visit New England next week with her team to play 
in a youth hockey tournament there. 
</P>
<P>
Hibsman has also turned down an offer to play on an all-girl hockey team that 
is forming in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing here with the boys gives me a different opportunity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she said, she'll probably end up studying medicine like Tina. Then 
she changed her mind: "I want to take this (ice hockey) thing as far as I can 
go with it."

CRAWFORD'S SPREE NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP VENTURA FROM TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ventura and Moorpark colleges tipped off Saturday, a share of the Northern 
Division title of the Western State Conference hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Crawford, Moorpark's 5-foot-9 freshman guard, proved equal to the 
challenge, scoring a school-record 49 points. Unfortunately that wasn't enough 
as Moorpark wound up on the short end of a 104-89 score. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, a Westchester High product, connected on 16 of 23 attempts from the 
field and converted 15 of 17 free throws, accounting for more than half of the 
Raiders' points. But six players scored in double figures for Ventura (25-9, 
11-3 in conference play) to more than offset Crawford's scintillating 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford broke Larry DeLaittre's long-standing record of 46 points set in 
1967-68, the Raiders' first season of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"I played the game as hard as I could and I had a very good night", Crawford 
said. "The game is about winning though, and we didn't win tonight, so the 
record doesn't mean anything to me. I'm very disappointed in this loss." 
</P>
<P>
With a win, Moorpark (21-10, 9-5), which last won a title in 1980-81, could 
have gained a share of the WSC title with Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders jumped to a 9-4 lead and maintained an advantage through the first 
10 minutes by shooting 53% from the field. But Ventura solved the Raider 
defense and went on a 19-5 run in the next 10 minutes. By halftime, the Pirates 
led, 44-35. 
</P>
<P>
"They just outplayed us, it was that simple," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. 
"They broke our defense and they hit the threes (three-point baskets) whenever 
we would make a run at them." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura won its fifth consecutive title behind the play of 6-foot-6 center 
Lester Neal, who scoreds 24 points and had 10 rebounds. Forward Chris Hantgin 
added 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a deeper bench than Moorpark and we just kept coming at them with 
fresh men," Ventura Coach Phil Matthews said. "That was a key to the win. Al 
just doesn't have the depth on the bench that we do." 
</P>
<P>
Raider center Greg Taylor had 15 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and forward 
Roger Thomas added 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
With a second-place finish in the Northern Division, Moorpark is almost assured 
of a playoff berth. Pairings will be announced Monday.

MASTER'S VIRTUALLY CLINCHES PLAYOFF BERTH WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was homecoming at The Master's College on Saturday night and the top door 
prize was a shot at a berth in the NAIA District 3 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A noisy, overflow crowd, estimated at 300 more than the gym's 1,000-person 
capacity, saw the Mustangs virtually clinch their first playoff berth with an 
84-64 win over defending district champion Biola. 
</P>
<P>
And afterward, Master's Coach Mel Hankinson was praising the fans as much as 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they played a big part," Hankinson said of the crowd that began to 
fill the gym an hour and a half before game time. "This was a big win. We're 
99% sure of receiving the first bid in this school's history, and I like those 
percentages." 
</P>
<P>
Before this season, Master's (18-14, 10-6 in district play) had not beaten 
Biola since 1971 and had won only three of 43 games against the Eagles. But the 
Mustangs have won all three meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this team is peaking at the right time," Hankinson said. "We're really 
playing well." 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat hesitant in the early going, Master's fell behind, 5-0, but quickly 
recovered and built a 38-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Master's scored the first three baskets of the second half to build the lead to 
16, but Biola (9-19, 6-8) put together an eight-point run to cut the margin to 
61-56 with seven minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Webster then hit a 17-foot jump shot, and reserve Stuart Epperson made 
six consecutive points to put Master's in front, 69-56. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Stuart Epperson was one of the unsung heroes," Hankinson said. "He 
turned the momentum back to us." 
</P>
<P>
Epperson's outburst put the Eagles on the ropes, but the final blow came when 
Biola center Jeff Baker, who scored a game-high 23 points, suffered a nasty 
gash above the eye and left the game with 4:21 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Master's quickly pulled away and padded the final margin with dunks by Webster 
and Tom Bruner. 
</P>
<P>
Webster led Master's with 21 points and nine rebounds, Epperson and Bruner each 
scored 14 points and Damon Greer scored 10 points and had eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Hill (18 points) was the only other Biola scorer to reach double figures.

ALHAMBRA COMEBACK FALLS SHORT AGAINST CHANNEL ISLANDS, 44-42 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Channel Islands High girls' basketball team wore knee pads in anticipation 
of a physical contest against Alhambra on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
And a physical contest is what it got. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were whistled for 39 fouls, 20 against Channel Islands. But the 
Raiders persevered and held off a furious Alhambra comeback to emerge with a 
44-42 victory in a Southern Section 5-AA Division second-round playoff game at 
Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands led by as many as 15 points in the second half and was ahead, 
43-36, with 1 minute 40 seconds to play when Alhambra rallied in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders converted only 10 of 21 free throws in the game and only one of 
three free throws in the final minute as Alhambra (19-7) closed to within two 
points with three seconds left on a three-point shot by Janet Lee (13 points). 
</P>
<P>
Sal Tauau scored 16 points and pulled down 10 rebounds for Channel Islands 
(22-6), and Candis Carper and Virgie Juarez each scored nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was really beating during this one," Channel Islands Coach Ryle 
Lynch-Cole said. "It was a total team effort tonight. We needed our bench and 
they came through." 
</P>
<P>
Tauau and Carper -- Channel Islands' leading rebounder and scorer -- were 
forced to sit out the second quarter in foul trouble, but Juarez, elevated from 
the junior varsity for the playoffs, came off the bench to score nine points, 
all in the first half as the Raiders took a 20-14 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands, the Marmonte League co-champion, will take on Morningside, an 
85-39 winner over Antelope Valley on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to Morningside," Lynch-Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Lynch-Cole wants to see how Tauau matches up against 
Morningside's 6-foot-5 center, Lisa Leslie, who scored 101 points in one half 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had trouble finding the range early, combining for only 10 points in 
the first 6 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands held a 6-4 advantage before Juarez hit a three-point basket and 
CeeCee Santiago made a free throw within a 20-second span. 
</P>
<P>
Tauau was the dominant force in the second half, scoring half of the Raiders' 
24 second-half points, most of them coming on inside shots. 
</P>
<P>
Trang Quach of Alhambra led all scorers with 18 points. KIRBY LEE

AND THE WINNER IS . . .; 
</P>
<P>
YES, IT'S THAT TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN OUR FEARLESS FORECASTER OF GRAMMY GLORY 
AGAIN PUTS HIS REPUTATION ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Grammys embrace rock. 
</P>
<P>
That's the usual headline on stories about how the Grammy nominations have 
gotten hipper in recent years. Among the acclaimed rock acts who have been 
nominated since the mid-'80s for album and/or record of the year honors: Bruce 
Springsteen, Prince, Peter Gabriel, David Bowie and Tracy Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grammys snub rock. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the usual headline on stories about how Grammy voters, in choosing the 
winners, continue to favor top-selling pop attractions over adventurous rock 
artists. None of the rockers cited above made it past the nomination stage in 
the two most prestigious categories. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, U2's anthem "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" lost 
the song of the year award to the old-fashioned movie theme "Somewhere Out 
There." Last year, Chapman's stark, socially conscious "Fast Car" lost the 
record of the year prize to Bobby McFerrin's amiable but lightweight "Don't 
Worry . . . Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
It's as if the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences -- which 
awards the Grammys -- has enlisted enough young, rock-conscious members to 
enable rock performers to be nominated in key categories, but not enough to 
enable them to win. In the end, the 7,000-member academy's large contingent of 
older, tradition-minded voters usually prevails. 
</P>
<P>
There have been exceptions. U2's critically lauded "The Joshua Tree" won the 
Grammy for album of the year two years ago. But the prizes mostly go to 
mainstream pop favorites like Phil Collins and George Michael. 
</P>
<P>
What does all this mean for this year's awards, which will be presented on 
Wednesday in a nationally televised ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium? 
</P>
<P>
Billy Joel, get that tux pressed. 
</P>
<P>
Even though multiple nominees Don Henley and Fine Young Cannibals are the toast 
of the rock critical Establishment, we're putting our money on Joel for record 
of the year and the Traveling Wilburys for best album. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Record of the Year 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals' "She Drives Me Crazy" isn't nominated in the song of the 
year category, which all but dooms its chances. Since 1972, every record of the 
year champ was at least nominated for best song. 
</P>
<P>
Mike + the Mechanics' classy, heartfelt "The Living Years" sounds like a 
winner, but the group has an identity problem -- namely, it doesn't have one. 
If a high-profile artist like Steve Winwood had recorded this song, it probably 
would win. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler's traditional ballad "Wind Beneath My Wings" is the kind of single 
that would have won hands-down in the early '70s, but no longer. As far back as 
10 years ago, Barbra Streisand and Neil Diamond's "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" 
-- the quintessential record in this genre -- lost out to the Doobie Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henley's "The End of the Innocence" is a strong candidate, but how many 
Grammy voters can hum it in the shower? Don't scoff: The hum factor probably 
explains why "Don't Worry . . . Be Happy" won. Also, the single peaked at No. 8 
on the weekly sales charts. Every record of the year winner since 1977 has 
reached the Top 3 except for Paul Simon's "Graceland." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," a time-capsule history of 
the past four decades of pop culture. We used to think voters would regard this 
as a clever but shallow and even irritating novelty record. Then we remembered 
"Don't Worry . . . Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
Joel it is, then, for the second time in this category (he won in 1978 for 
"Just the Way You Are"). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Album of the Year 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Raitt's "Nick of Time," which has yet to go platinum (1 million copies), 
is a l-o-n-g-shot. Every album of the year champ has been a multiplatinum 
seller since platinum awards were introduced in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Petty, nominated as a member of the Traveling 
</P>
<P>
Wilburys and for his own "Full Moon Fever," is the first artist to have two 
albums in the finals since Streisand in 1964. But people who like Petty will 
probably vote for the Wilburys, to enable his famous cronies to share the 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
Fine Young Cannibals' "The Raw &amp; the Cooked" will be the clear favorite of 
the academy's under-30 voters. Both of them. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Henley's "The End of the Innocence" is a strong contender. But the title 
track is its main calling card, and if that won't win, why should the album? 
</P>
<P>
That leaves "Traveling Wilburys, Vol. 1," a widely admired collaboration by 
five celebrated rock veterans -- Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Petty, Jeff Lynne 
and the late Roy Orbison. This album has the broadest potential base of support 
-- from pop and rock listeners to country and adult contemporary adherents -- 
of any of the nominees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Song of the Year 
</P>
<P>
This award traditionally favors compositions that have the potential to become 
standards -- i.e. romantic ballads. That hurts the chances of both "We Didn't 
Start the Fire" (written by Joel) and "The End of the Innocence" (Henley and 
Bruce Hornsby). "The Living Years" (Mike Rutherford and B. A. Robertson) will 
probably finish somewhere in the middle, with the race coming down to the Linda 
Ronstadt-Aaron Neville smash "Don't Know Much" (Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and 
Tom Snow) and "Wind Beneath My Wings" (Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar). 
</P>
<P>
The well-liked Mann and Weil won this award two years ago for the 
Ronstadt-James Ingram smash "Somewhere Out There." But this time they're 
outmatched. "Wind" is the year's most obvious standard, and the likely winner. 
</P>
<P>
Though Janet Jackson was shut out in the big categories, she's the front-runner 
in four other contests. That would make her the year's biggest multiple winner. 
And in one of those races -- best long-form music video -- she's going 
head-to-head with older brother and rival Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
That's the real drama in this year's Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the likely winners in other key races: 
</P>
<P>
BEST NEW ARTIST: Jazzie B's critically lauded British soul ensemble Soul II 
Soul will edge out critically panned mega-sellers Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
POP MALE: Joel is very strong, but how can voters bypass Orbison, one of the 
classic pop vocalists of all time? Is it a sympathy vote? No. It's a final 
chance for the academy to rectify past wrongs whereby Orbison never won in the 
pop field. 
</P>
<P>
POP FEMALE: Midler won in 1980 for "The Rose" and she'll win again. (Unless 
enough last-minute voters went to "Stella" screenings.) 
</P>
<P>
POP DUO/GROUP: Duets often win in this category, and Ronstadt and Aaron Neville 
are both highly respected. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK MALE: It's a toss-up between Petty and Henley. Since Petty has never won a 
Grammy, he has the edge. (That makes three No. 2 finishes for Henley, who will 
go home knowing how the Denver Broncos feel.) 
</P>
<P>
ROCK FEMALE: Bonnie Raitt's album of the year nomination is the tip-off. She'll 
beat Tina Turner, who has had a lock on this award since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK DUO/GROUP: The Wilburys again. Fellow nominees the Rolling Stones have yet 
to win a Grammy (!), but this probably won't be their year. 
</P>
<P>
HARD ROCK: Controversial mega-sellers Guns N' Roses define the category and 
will likely win, though Living Colour, which tore down the Berlin Wall of 
segregated rock and black playlists, will also have support. 
</P>
<P>
METAL: Metallica, upset last year by the miscategorized Jethro Tull, will 
finally prevail. 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B MALE: In the year of Bobby Brown, who else could possibly win? 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B FEMALE: Anita Baker beat Janet Jackson three years ago. This is 
Jackson's year to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B DUO/GROUP: Soul II Soul wins Award II. 
</P>
<P>
RAP: Tone Loc made the biggest splash, becoming the first black rapper to top 
the pop album chart. That makes his smash "Funky Cold Medina" a clear favorite. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY MALE: Clint Black, country's hottest newcomer since Randy Travis, 
should beat two-time winner Travis. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY FEMALE: k.d. lang won last year for a duet with Orbison and should win 
this year on her own. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY DUO/GROUP: In the absence of a strong alternative, the Judds are the 
favorites to win here for the fifth time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
COUNTRY VOCAL COLLABORATION: How could the voters resist Hank Williams Jr.'s 
teaming with his late and legendary father Hank Williams on "There's a Tear in 
My Beer"? 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC VIDEO -- SHORT FORM: Michael Jackson revealed a sense of humor about 
himself in "Leave Me Alone." For that astonishment, he deserves a Grammy. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC VIDEO -- LONG FORM: Michael Jackson's nominated here too for 
"Moonwalker," but will likely lose to sister Janet's "Rhythm Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Grein tabbed 14 of 21 categories correctly last year. Done in by his 
prediction of a clean sweep for Tracy Chapman, he resolved not to read any rock 
criticism in the month leading up to Grammy voting.

REWINDING 'A CLOCKWORK ORANGE'; 
</P>
<P>
THE OLD ULTRA-VIOLENCE WORKED AS A BOOK AND A MOVIE, SO WHY NOT AS A PLAY WITH 
MUSIC BY U2? THAT WAS THE ROYAL SHAKESPEARE COMPANY'S IDEA. LONDON AUDIENCES 
CALL IT 'HORRORSHOW,' BUT TO CRITICS IT'S JUST A HORROR.

<TEXT>
<P>
The words currently being spoken by Royal Shakespeare Company actors from the 
stage of the Barbican Theatre are not words the Bard of Stratford would have 
recognized as any form of English. 
</P>
<P>
 Droogs. Viddy. Rassoodock. Real Horrorshow. 
</P>
<P>
 But devotees of Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel, "A Clockwork Orange," and the 
1971 movie of the book by Stanley Kubrick, will be familiar with the language 
-- a teen-age slang called "nadsat," devised by Burgess from elements of 
English and Russian. In this strange tongue, "droogs" are friends, to "viddy" 
is to see, "rassoodock" is the mind and "horrorshow," surprisingly, means 
really good. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades after the movie's violence precipitated heated and widespread 
controversy in Britain, the work -- its title now amended by Burgess to "A 
Clockwork Orange 2004" -- is being produced as a play with background music, 
for the first time by a major company. 
</P>
<P>
It has given the Royal Shakespeare Company a huge hit. Despite chilly reviews, 
not a ticket is to be had between now and the end of its run in mid-March -- an 
ironic circumstance, given the RSC's serious financial predicament (see 
accompanying box). Its success at the Barbican would seem to stem from its 
appeal to young people who rarely attend the theater. From out of the woodwork, 
"A Clockwork Orange" has brought to the Barbican audiences far too young to 
remember the controversy over the work, but apparently familiar with Burgess' 
book and Kubrick's movie -- even though the film has not been available on 
video in England and received only a limited film distribution originally. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, part of the production's popularity may arise from director Ron 
Daniels' decision to commission music for "A Clockwork Orange 2004" from two of 
the world's best-known rock musicians, Edge and Bono from U2. 
</P>
<P>
Word is also out about the performance of RSC actor Phil Daniels (no relation 
to the director). In the leading role of the intelligent young thug Alex, 
Daniels (who appeared in the rock-drama movie "Quadrophenia") is eliciting the 
sort of audience response one might expect from a pop star, with some teen-age 
girls' screams clearly audible among thundering applause. Not since David 
Warner played Hamlet in the mid-1960s has the Royal Shakespeare Company seen 
this kind of adolescent enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess himself had originally devised a theatrical version of "A Clockwork 
Orange" about five years ago, with lyrics and suggestions about accompanying 
music. As Ron Daniels tells it, Burgess "was tired of bad versions being put 
together by pub theaters and rock groups." 
</P>
<P>
But Daniels found Burgess's own stage version "rather bare -- it doesn't 
reflect all the comic richness and ironies of the original." 
</P>
<P>
So Daniels, working from the novel, devised the theatrical text. (The credits 
for the production read: "Anthony Burgess in collaboration with Ron Daniels," 
which, says Daniels, is fine with him.) 
</P>
<P>
The production remains true to the spirit of Burgess' novel. It tells the story 
of Alex, a bright, articulate 15-year-old who loves the music of Beethoven. But 
Alex and his three droogs also get high on drug-spiked milk. In his favorite 
night spot, the Korova Milk Bar, they indulge in sprees of mugging and rape. 
The old ultra-violence, as Alex calls it. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually jailed for the brutal murder of a helpless old woman, Alex is chosen 
as a guinea pig by a repressive government intent on imposing law and order. He 
undergoes aversion therapy, and is shown horrific sequences of filmed violence 
while being induced to vomit. This works -- but he also develops an aversion to 
the music of Beethoven, which accompanies the violent images on film. 
</P>
<P>
So when Alex is sent back into the world, "cured" and nonviolent, will he be at 
the mercy of vengeful beatings from those he wronged? 
</P>
<P>
Many characters in the play argue that he is not at risk -- he has been 
brainwashed, and is only "good" because he is deprived of making a free moral 
choice. In the final scenes -- based on the last chapter of Burgess' book that 
was cut from its American edition, and not dealt with in Kubrick's movie -- 
Alex muses on growing up, out of his flirtation with ultra-violence. He even 
ponders the pleasures of having a son. 
</P>
<P>
But why revive "A Clockwork Orange" now? Ron Daniels describes it as "an 
amazingly prophetic novel. It's the kind of work from which good company pieces 
are made. It's a good story full of moral inquiry, which I think is the stuff 
of the RSC." 
</P>
<P>
He had also seen Kubrick's movie, and thought it "an extremely exciting piece 
of cinema, but a cultural monument rooted in the '60s. For me, the task was 
setting up a production that was much more contemporary." 
</P>
<P>
With this is mind, he approached Edge and Bono -- who, as it turned out, were 
themselves concentrating on the problem of teen crime, having recently viewed 
the 
</P>
<P>
toughest gang turfs in Los Angeles from the back of a police car. They saw what 
Edge calls "an ultra-violent underclass." 
</P>
<P>
The members of U2 have never sought to hide their Christian beliefs, and the 
lyrics of their songs are themselves shot through with a sense of moral 
inquiry. "After seeing the first rehearsal," says Edge, "we felt that 'A 
Clockwork Orange' had never been so relevant, and that it was worth using our 
music to try and put the story into this context." 
</P>
<P>
But the music that he and Bono submitted hardly approximates chart-bound 
material -- nor does it remotely recall anything one might expect to find in a 
conventional stage musical. The instrument music is rhythmic and abstract, with 
Edge playing expressive guitar to produce an unsettling effect. Combined with 
the lightning of the production -- which sometimes bathes the stage in 
blood-red shadows -- the music and spoken dialogue evoke an aggressive, violent 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
But this time around, despite the success of the production, no one is 
complaining about the way in which violence is depicted. Says Ron Daniels: "We 
have staged the violent scenes accurately, but we have tried to make them not 
only violent but slightly tawdry and mundane. It's comparable to what's 
actually happening in the streets today. And I think people who come here 
expecting to be either gratified or outraged by the violence will be surprised 
by that." 
</P>
<P>
Burgess, who now lives in tax exile in Monaco, has complained over the years 
that while he is the author of 50 books, many people thought "A Clockwork 
Orange" was the only one he had ever written. Even before Kubrick made his 
move, pop groups had been interested in adapting the novel. For a time, the 
Rolling Stones had an option on it, and Mick Jagger was reportedly keen to play 
Alex. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his attempt at a theatrical version of the work, Burgess now admits (in 
the play's program notes) that "the final textual authority . . . rests with 
this present Royal Shakespeare Company production." He has not made himself 
available for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
He has not made himself available After Edge submitted his musical 
contributions, it transpired that Burgess was so oblivious to contemporary rock 
music that for a while he was under the impression the score had been written 
by someone called Ed. 
</P>
<P>
It was Burgess who suggested putting the date 2004 after the title of the 
current production. "He sort of rushed into print with it," says Ron Daniels, 
who sees no need for it: "I think one of the joys of the novel is that it's 
timeless and placeless. It could be New York, London, Moscow now, 50 years 
hence or whenever." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he insists it has a contemporary relevance. "I think the story applies 
even more so today, certainly in the sense of urban decay you get from our 
inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
"The novel and the film came out before our TV screens became saturated with 
images of violence. Now we've seen Vietnam on TV, we've seen Tien An Men Square 
and we don't perceive violence in the same way. We've partaken of the violence 
in that sense; our homes are no longer sanctuaries." 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Kubrick opted for a stylized, chilling, almost balletic approach in 
depicting the razor-slashing, almost thuggery of Alex and his Droogs. One of 
the movie's notorious scenes showed them on a violent spree, accompanied by the 
uplifting strains of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks of the film's release in Britain, press accounts appeared of youth 
gangs on the prowl dressed like Alex's droogs -- in bowler hats, carrying 
umbrellas and sporting long false eyelashes on one eye. Every outbreak of 
juvenile delinquency in public parks or soccer stadiums was inevitably dubbed a 
"Clockwork Orange-style incident." 
</P>
<P>
Unquestionably, the media in Britain made the most of the shock value generated 
by the film. Equally unquestionably, some of the film's younger audiences were 
entranced by the ultra-violence is portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy simply refused to die down, and Kubrick, who lives in England, 
ceased to make any further comment about the film. Eventually, Kubrick's family 
and relatives started to receive death threats -- so the director had the film 
withdrawn from British movie theaters. For years, it could not be seen in 
cinemas or on home video in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The result? "A Clockwork Orange 2004" has arrived with a tremendous amount of 
mystique and interest attached to it. The brisk business it has been doing owes 
nothing to London's theater critics who have at best praised the production 
tentatively, and at worst savaged it. 
</P>
<P>
"For all the hints of relevance, I am not sure of the point," wrote Martin 
Hoyle in the Financial Times. The Daily Telegraph's Charles Osborne found "a 
dialogue which runs the game from the plodding to the affluent," while Michael 
Billington of the Guardian, though admiring Phil Daniels as Alex and "the 
undeniable zip and flair" of the staging, thought the story "only fully works 
as a novel." 
</P>
<P>
The critics on Britain's Sunday newspapers were, if anything, even harsher. The 
Observer's Michael Coveney, condemning it as "trite and meretricious," added: 
"It results merely from a desire to make money but betrays not so much the 
company's financial desperation as its spiritual bankruptcy." "A jolly thin 
time we have of it for nearly three hours," echoed John Peter of the Sunday 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
None of these considerations seemed to bother the young audience who watched a 
recent midweek matinee performance. Many stood to applaud Phil Daniels when it 
came time for curtain call, and they chattered animatedly about the show as 
they spilled out into the Barbican subway station afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the audience were of student age, and were orderly, middle-class and, 
judging by their mode of dress, faintly radical. Ultra-violence, for this 
crowd, was primarily an abstract idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil Daniels was just brilliant," said Mike Smythe, an English literature 
student from South London. "I thought he brought Alex to life as well as 
anyone." Smythe unbuttoned his overcoat to reveal a Clockwork Orange T-shirt 
from the film. "An American mate of mine recorded the movie on video for me," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
On the tube train, one young man was completely decked out in Clockwork Orange 
garb -- bowler hat, tight black suit with pants cut short above the ankle, and 
white socks. "Just call me Alex," he said with a cultured accent and a wicked 
grin. And had he liked the production? He lapsed into nadsat. "Real 
horrorshow," he said.

GRAMMY VOTERS FACE TOUGH JAZZ CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than in past years, 1990 Grammy voters were faced with very tough choices 
in the jazz division because so many first-class projects made it to the final 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Take the big band jazz instrumental category. McCoy Tyner's zesty 
"Uptown/Downtown" (Columbia/CBS) and the romping Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra's 
"The Definitive Thad Jones" (MusicMasters), two examples of modern large 
ensemble jazz at its finest, are up against Miles Davis' "Aura" (Columbia/CBS), 
where the trumpeter is spotlighted in a number of settings, as well as Duke 
Ellington's "Music Is My Mistress" (MusicMasters) and Count Basie's Orchestra, 
conducted by Frank Foster, "The Legend, The Legacy"(Denon) -- two stellar 
mainstream big band releases. While sentiment favors drummer Lewis, who died 
Feb. 2, the Foster-led Basie contingent seems a more likely winner. 
</P>
<P>
The jazz/fusion category is another all-star slugfest. Davis' "Amandla" (Warner 
Bros.) dukes it out with the Pat Metheny Group's "Letter From Home" (Geffen), 
Larry Carlton's "On Solid Ground" (MCA), John Patitucci's "On the Corner" 
(GRP), Joe Sample's "Spellbound" (Warner Bros.) and Terri Lyne Carrington's 
"Real Life Story" (Verve Forecast). True, Carrington is the first woman ever to 
be nominated in the jazz/fusion slot and Patitucci's release overflows with 
good sounds; still, we see Carlton's effort -- his first since recovering from 
a gunshot assault outside his Hollywood Hills home -- as the one left standing 
after this Grammy title fight. 
</P>
<P>
Some other picks: singer Dianne Schuur should score a female jazz vocal Grammy, 
with her "The Christmas Song" (GRP) besting Ruth Brown's "Blues on Broadway" 
(Fantasy) and Anita O'Day's "In a Mellow Tone" (DRG); Joe Williams should win 
another male jazz vocal for his "In Good Company," coming out ahead of Lou 
Rawls' "At Last" (Blue Note) and George Benson's "Tenderly" (Warner Bros.), 
among others, and "Chick Corea's Akoustic Band" (GRP) should top Wynton 
Marsalis' "The Majesty of the Blues" (CBS) and Andre Previn's "After Hours" in 
the group jazz instrumental arena.

KEYBOARDIST JOE ZAWINUL: FROM WEATHER REPORT TO RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a far cry from the synthesizers of Joe Zawinul's Weather Report to the 
happening scene of rap. But, somehow, the Vienna-born keyboard master who 
co-led the jazz/rock fusion group with Wayne Shorter from 1970 to 1985 has 
bridged the gap. His best known composition, "Birdland," which became a disco 
hit for Weather Report in the 1970s is on the charts again, this time as part 
of Quincy Jones' smash "Back on the Block," currently one of the country's Top 
10 albums, already certified platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul in the post-Weather Report years has flitted about among fusion, jazz, 
pop vocal (sometimes with messages) and classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Just before leaving his Malibu home last week for a concert stint with a full 
orchestra in Cologne, he waxed ecstatic about the new testament. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just gotten back from a trip to Japan with the Zawinul Syndicate and 
found a message that Quincy Jones was looking for me," Zawinul said. "He needed 
the exact line; he had seen lead sheets but wanted to have it exactly the way I 
wrote it. He said, 'Hey man I'm going to record it and I want to use rappers. 
I'd like to turn on a lot of young folks, the black kids especially, who never 
saw Birdland but need to know what it represented.' " 
</P>
<P>
Birdland was the self-described "Jazz Corner of the World" from 1949 until it 
closed in 1965. "All of us in Vienna knew about this fabulous place. Friederich 
Gulda, the great pianist, played there with a jazz group and told me all about 
it. We all dreamed about visiting Birdland some day." 
</P>
<P>
His dream was realized not long after he emigrated in 1959. After working 
briefly in Maynard Ferguson's band, he toured for almost two years as Dinah 
Washington's accompanist, even working with her at the now legendary club at 
Broadway and 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"That club made such an impact on me," Zawinul said. "I met Miles (Davis) 
there, and Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong; I met my wife Maxine there. 
Everyone I worshiped I met at Birdland." 
</P>
<P>
When Zawinul wrote the song, his manager was skeptical. "Who cares about Bird 
or Birdland?" Zawinul was adamant: "I don't care what you say, that's what I 
want to call it. And, of course, it was not only a big hit then in the 1970s, 
but also when Jon Hendricks set lyrics to it in the '80s and Manhattan Transfer 
recorded it, they won the Grammy. So now we're in the '90s and it's on an album 
that will sell 10 times as many as all the rest together." 
</P>
<P>
For his role on the Jones record, Zawinul used the Korg Pepe. "That's a little 
instrument I invented, with a bassoon-like mouthpiece. I played that in the 
title tune, 'Back on the Block.' On 'Birdland,' I just played a synth bass line 
on the introduction. Quincy gave me complete freedom to do what I liked; I 
could have been with Cannonball's band (of which he was a member from 1961-70) 
or with my own band." 
</P>
<P>
He gives Jones credit for using the album to introduce a new generation to 
timeless sounds. "All of a sudden those kids on the street hear Dizzy and Miles 
and James Moody and Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. Hey, he's done something 
important to get as many people as possible interested in an art form that is 
more alive than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Jones agrees. "I've felt for a long time that there was a correlation between 
hip-hop and be-bop," he said by telephone from New York. "That's today 
language, and they are both forms of rebellion. One of the biggest kicks for me 
was hearing my 12-year-old grandson, Sunny D, saying that 'Birdland' was his 
favorite tune on the album, and then asking, 'Grandpa, who's Miles Davis? Who's 
Ella?' I just came back from a tour of six countries, and this sort of thing is 
happening all over." 
</P>
<P>
The Jones interlude was just one brief moment in a schedule that has maintained 
Zawinul's role as an intercontinental idiom-hopper. He has been to Europe 14 
times in the last 18 months, sometimes with his Zawinul Syndicate but often for 
classical ventures with his old friend Gulda. 
</P>
<P>
"With Gulda I've played Brahms' 'Variations for Two Pianos' and some Mozart and 
some of our own things," Zawinul said. "I was at the Salzburg Festival last 
year when Herbert von Karajan was still alive, and I started out with jazz, 
which at one time they wouldn't allow. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I did the Mozart with the orchestra, and after the concert we all went 
over to the Dom Platz and I played with my own band for two or three hours. A 
triumph! This year we did the same thing, but it was with Gulda and Herbie 
Hancock and me, with dual acoustic pianos. 
</P>
<P>
"In May I'll have my own special day at the Weiner Festival; next year they're 
giving me two days, and for 1995, when we have the World's Fair in Vienna, I've 
been commissioned to write a symphony and a musical show." 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul's evolution during his three U.S.-based decades has been unremitting 
and exemplary since his formative era as big band pianist, accompanist to 
singers and longtime Adderley associate. It was in Cannonball's Quintet that he 
wrote his first pop-jazz hit, "Mercy, Mercy, Mercy" and since then, he has been 
on an endless voyage of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
But, along with experiments, he has never totally lost touch with the jazz 
breeding ground that set him on his way. In the latest album, "Black Water" 
(Columbia CK 44316), he plays "Monk's Mood" as a piano solo much as he might 
have played it in the pre-fusion years, then segues into another Monk piece, 
"Little Rootie Tootie," in which he offers a puckish solo on the Korg Pepe. 
</P>
<P>
On another tune, "Medicine Man," he plays the accordion, an instrument he took 
up as a youngster in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul's powerful social conscience comes through too: The message in the 
title tune, for which his bassist Gerald Veasley supplied the lyrics, is a 
strong indictment of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
And "Black Water"is a family affair. Ivan Zawinul, 21, was involved in the 
computer programming as well as various instrumental and vocal overdubs. "He's 
my full time engineer," his father says. Erich Zawinul, 24, now living in 
Vienna, is a graphic artist who designed the cover. Anthony Zawinul, 28, works 
in a law office but has been working on movie scores and is the 
composer/performer on "And So It Goes," the last cut in "Black Water." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, as he has diversified his career, Zawinul has encountered 
criticism. In a recent interview the New York bop pianist Barry Harris said of 
Weather Report: "What kills me about those kinds of groups is that when someone 
has a jazz festival they bring these cats together and call them a jazz group. 
I say they've ceased to be jazz musicians. I know the cats like Joe Zawinul can 
play all the standards; but they haven't been jazz musicians for 10 or 15 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Zawinul, who is the last musician likely to be accused of a lack of 
self-confidence, laughed. "I like Barry Harris; I have no problem with what 
people say. He is one of the finest, but he's a copy of Bud Powell. 
</P>
<P>
"I have arrived, you see. Last summer at the Montmartre in Copenhagen they had 
a list of coming attractions. They had Betty Carter, and they identified her as 
a jazz vocalist. They billed some band and described it as a rock group. But 
with my name they had no description. They just said 'Zawinul.' Not jazz, not 
rock, just me. I am my own category."

<P>
HOW GEFFEN'S 'STREET SCOUTS' HAVE CHANGED THE WAY THE RECORD INDUSTRY FINDS 
GOLD IN L.A.'S HARD-ROCK SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One wall of Vicky Hamilton's tiny office on a Hollywood side street is covered 
with framed photos of celebrated Los Angeles hard-rock bands of the '80s -- 
Motley Crue, Stryper, Poison, Guns N' Roses, Faster Pussycat, Darling Cruel, 
the Lostboys, Salty Dog. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, 31, is more than a fan of these groups. During the last seven years, 
she discovered them and helped develop their careers: getting them gigs, 
putting them up, feeding them, working with them on image and sound -- 
sometimes for pay, but other times just for the love of it. 
</P>
<P>
While it's surprising to find a woman so heavily involved in a field dominated 
by macho images, the most remarkable thing about Hamilton is her consistency in 
spotting upcoming talent. In baseball terms, Hamilton is batting a scorching 
eight for eight. 
</P>
<P>
All of those bands have landed record deals, and the first five already have 
hit albums. Motley Crue and Guns N' Roses alone have sold more than 20 million 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"All these bands had that extra thing that was gonna separate them from the 
pack," Hamilton says, pointing to the photos on the wall. "When I see it, I 
know. If I feel a passion for it, I'll go after it with that same kind of 
passion. That's why I end up with them before anyone else -- because a band can 
sense the enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
It was the remarkable track record of this one-time record store clerk that led 
Geffen Records artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) executive Tom Zutaut to hire 
Hamilton three years ago as an independent talent scout. (She has since been 
named a full-time member of Geffen's artists and repertoire staff, though she 
continues to work out of her own office and manage some bands, including the 
Lostboys). 
</P>
<P>
As Hamilton settled into her new Geffen job, the hard-rock den mother became 
one of the prototypes for a new breed of A&amp;R specialist -- the "street 
scout." 
</P>
<P>
These talent searchers are non-corporate, night-blooming mavericks hired by 
record companies to scour the clubs in search of promising young rock groups. 
Geffen has had so much success with its team of scouts that almost every other 
L.A. record company and major music publisher now has at least one scout on its 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
But in many ways, it was Zutaut himself who wrote the street scout handbook. He 
first made a name for himself in 1982 when, as a 22-year-old Elektra Records 
salesman, he persuaded dubious label executives to sign Motley Crue. 
</P>
<P>
The band was once the laughingstock of the L.A. club scene in its high heels 
and makeup, but the laughter stopped when the Crue went on to sell millions of 
records and inspire countless other glam groups. 
</P>
<P>
Zutaut followed that left-field coup, which in effect ignited the L.A. 
hard-rock boom, by signing Dokken to Elektra before going on to Geffen and 
sniffing out Hamilton's discovery, Guns N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the renegade street scout methodology, Zutaut didn't learn about 
Guns N' Roses by taking a call from a high-priced attorney. He simply walked 
into Vinyl Fetish, the trendy Melrose Avenue record shop, and asked the clerk 
if he'd heard any good bands lately. The rest is clubland history. 
</P>
<P>
While virtually every label now has its man or woman on the street, no record 
company is as fully committed to the concept as Geffen, whose scouts have 
brought in a dozen L.A. bands, ranging from Guns N' Roses to neo-folkies the 
Brothers Figaro, whose debut album is due this spring. 
</P>
<P>
One of three key A&amp;R executives at the record label (John Kalodner and Gary 
Gersh are the others), Zutaut is the informal leader of the company's sizable 
street-level force. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup includes street scouts Hamilton, Mio Vukovic and Anna Statman; tape 
listeners Maria Niles and Todd Sullivan, and a pair of "undercover agents" who 
roam the clubs literally incognito. (Former scout Jeff Fenster, who signed the 
Brothers Figaro, recently became the director of A&amp;R for Charisma Records, 
a newly reactivated spinoff of Virgin Records.) 
</P>
<P>
Operating autonomously, each member of this informal team spends several nights 
a week in the clubs, frequently scheduling two or three stops per outing. (See 
Club Guide on Page 66). 
</P>
<P>
Neil Portnow, who runs the West Coast office of Zomba Enterprises (Jive Records 
and Zomba Music), acknowledges the impact of the Geffen approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that Geffen was the creator of the (street-level A&amp;R) 
concept, but I would say that they have taken it to its furthest development," 
Portnow says. 
</P>
<P>
"What Geffen has done is to make a real commitment to it, just in the sheer 
numbers of people that they have. Consequently, they're reaping the benefits of 
having a number of people whose primary focus is developing new talent from the 
street level up, as opposed to the attorney/manager, Establishment route." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on this artist-oriented approach is consistent with the vision of 
company head David Geffen, who founded and ran Asylum Records in the early '70s 
and personally orchestrated the careers of such artists as the Eagles, Joni 
Mitchell and Jackson Browne. 
</P>
<P>
After Asylum merged with Elektra two years later, Geffen left the record 
business for a time, returning in 1979 to launch Geffen Records. Originally 
conceived as an A&amp;R satellite of Warner Bros. Records, Geffen Records has 
gone on to become the most successful independently owned label in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen's extreme A&amp;R orientation "comes from a combination of David's 
background and my background," says label president Ed Rosenblatt, a veteran 
record man. "David's always been involved with artists, and that's what we both 
felt in our initial conversations that a record company should be about -- 
which is the artists. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) neither David nor I felt that we had the talent to go into these various 
clubs and be able to look at, say, the second of five bands you see that night 
and discern that 'if you get rid of the bass player, (we could sell records).' 
So the first employees we had were A&amp;R people, and we grew from there." 
</P>
<P>
While Geffen and Rosenblatt have surrounded the A&amp;R department with a crack 
team of promotion, sales and marketing specialists, the impetus for Geffen's 
efforts -- and numerous successes -- continues to emanate from the hands-on 
activities of Kalodner, Zutaut and Gersh. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the music it doesn't mean anything," Rosenblatt says. 
</P>
<P>
Seated behind a cassette-strewn desk in his first-floor office on the Sunset 
Strip, the bulky, baby-faced Zutaut looks and sounds more like a grad student 
than a record executive. He chooses his words carefully, speaking in 
well-constructed paragraphs, as if he were delivering a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of any record company is finding new talent and bringing it to the 
forefront, and that's my particular speciality," Zutaut says. "But John 
Kalodner, Gary Gersh and myself were getting so busy in the studio and 
following through on the projects we had that we couldn't be in the clubs every 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like there was gonna be a renaissance of bands, and I didn't want us 
to miss out on what was going on at the street level. . . . We realized that we 
really needed street scouts." 
</P>
<P>
So Zutaut began searching in unconventional places for fresh A&amp;R talent. He 
lured Statman away from independent label Slash, grabbed up Fenster from the 
business affairs department of Warner Bros., and found Vukovic at the 
underground club Scream. Zutaut took Hamilton, Statman and Fenster under his 
wing, while Vukovic was placed in the care of Kalodner. 
</P>
<P>
Once the street team was in place, the Geffen brain trust immediately granted 
the new apprentices full signing power. The act of signing an artist sets in 
motion a sequence that typically adds up to an outlay of from $200,000 to 
$400,000 in recording, touring, video and promotional expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Many record executives might be reluctant to give a fresh-faced kid, even one 
blessed with "good ears," a quarter of a million dollars to play with. 
</P>
<P>
Not the Geffen leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the newest person here, if they really believe in a band, they can sign 
it," Zutaut says. "You can't have a committee that decides. You pick people 
with great instincts, and then you have to let them sink or swim. Everybody has 
three or four years to come up with a winner, so if it doesn't happen, you have 
only yourself to blame." 
</P>
<P>
The primary challenge for Geffen's night patrol is finding some viable bands -- 
not an easy task when you have to sift through the hundreds of groups that 
might pass through local clubs in a year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Grierson, the head of A&amp;R at rival Epic Records, who's 
been searching for a plugged-in L.A. street scout of his own, "No matter how 
many people you have, they've got to have an awful lot of contacts out there -- 
their little spies who always come to them (with leads). That's the key." 
</P>
<P>
Intuition also plays a part in the search. 
</P>
<P>
French-born UCLA grad Vukovic, 26, cultivated his network of contacts during 
his years as a club-scene regular. Several of them mentioned a particular new 
band to him, but it was the group's intriguing name -- Junkyard -- that 
initially drew him to the group. 
</P>
<P>
He became even more interested when he discovered that one of the guitarists 
had played in two Austin punk bands that Vukovic admired. Yet Junkyard, he 
recalls, seemed only adequate at best the first two times he saw them. 
</P>
<P>
"But one night they were playing at Scream with a new rhythm section, and all 
of a sudden they had my attention," he says. "The songs were happening -- they 
had this Southern flavor, like Lynyrd Skynyrd meets Motorhead. I go, 'Cool, 
this is the stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
The band's debut album, "Junkyard," released last summer, has sold more than 
150,000 copies. While far from a hit, the LP has established a base for the 
young group, which was previously unknown outside Los Angeles. Vukovic 
considers the LP "a successful first outing." 
</P>
<P>
With such high stakes involved on the L.A. club scene, one of the most 
difficult tasks for record scouts is trusting their instincts rather than being 
swept along in the hysteria that sometimes surfaces when several companies zero 
in on the same new band. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many cretin A&amp;R people running around the streets," Vukovic 
says. "They all get into a club, they see each other, panic, and start throwing 
money at bands. And these poor bands, they don't know what is going on. That's 
the worst scenario." 
</P>
<P>
In just his second year, Vukovic, 26, is already an A&amp;R man other A&amp;R 
people watch closely. So closely, in fact, that it's becoming a problem for him 
to go to the clubs (just as it is for Zutaut and Hamilton, who for years 
refused to be photographed to avoid being recognized by bands and managers). 
</P>
<P>
Zutaut says, "You know that the minute Geffen Records wants a band, every other 
label is gonna offer them a deal. So then it's up to you to convince a band why 
you're the right place for them to be. We make very fair deals here, but not to 
the point of ridiculousness, where it takes someone an extra $100,000 to 
$200,000 to bribe somebody to go with them instead of us. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not gonna match a ridiculous deal, but we do give people plenty of money 
to survive on for a while and plenty of money to make a good record with." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Michele Anthony of the law firm Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg &amp; 
Phillips has made deals with Zutaut for three of her clients -- Shadowland, 
King of Kings and Edan. 
</P>
<P>
"What's unique about Tom's approach is his development-type deals. He'll sign a 
band, commit to an album, give them $4,000-6,000 a month to live on, stick them 
in a studio, buy them a tape recorder, and make them write. . .and rehearse. At 
the end of that period they'll have a bunch of great songs, and the band is 
really reaching rather than doing that (junk) that you normally get on a first 
record." 
</P>
<P>
Signing a band is just the first step. The next is the crucial matter of 
developing a band's potential. Before getting promoted to full-time A&amp;R 
rep, Vicky Hamilton brought Salty Dog and Shadowland to Zutaut. While both are 
now considered to be "Zutaut bands," Hamilton, an acknowledged master, was put 
in charge of what she calls their "refinement." 
</P>
<P>
"Shadowland started as a demo deal," Hamilton recalls. "We did a demo and it 
was good, but Tom still wasn't sure. Then we went to a couple of shows, and it 
became more evident that the guitar player wasn't cutting it. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a new guitar player and put the band on a six-month development deal. 
Geffen gave them some living money, paid their rehearsals and helped them get 
an eight-track board so that they could record their songs at home. The record 
deal was already a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton continued the development of Shadowland and Salty Dog, which also 
involved replacing the guitarist in the latter band. "Tom made the records," 
says Hamilton, who discovered the bands while she was still a mere 
tape-listener, and so yielded official credit to Zutaut. "Both the records are 
amazing, so I don't really feel bad about (not getting the credit). Had I been 
under (the present deal) and that happened, I would've been (angry)." 
</P>
<P>
Few would disagree, however, that acknowledgment is essential in the A&amp;R 
sector, where a street scout's career can be made by being credited with the 
discovery of a hit band. When Hamilton finds a band, for example, she 
immediately faxes Rosenblatt and Zutaut, in effect laying formal claim to the 
act in question. 
</P>
<P>
Like her fellow street scouts, small, blonde Anna Statman, 30, prowls the clubs 
night after night in search of a band that will elevate her tentative status in 
the A&amp;R community. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike her high-visibility colleagues, though, Statman is rarely recognized. 
"Besides, I stand at the front while the band is on stage, and I'm so short 
that nobody ever knows I'm there," she jokes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a camaraderie among the A&amp;R people," Statman says, "but at the 
same time there's a little bit of competitive edge. But it's not a problem. I 
get along with Tom great. If it weren't for him I wouldn't be here. He's taught 
me a lot in a very short time, and I still feel like I've got years and years 
to learn from this guy." 
</P>
<P>
But Statman admits that she and Zutaut have their disagreements. Just a few 
minutes prior to meeting with a reporter, in fact, the two could be heard 
arguing about whether to mix a track recorded for Statman's Lock Up project. 
Statman felt the song was "too pop" for the band's street image; Zutaut 
insisted "you never turn down a (potential) hit." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton says, "I have those spats with him too. Tom is like my big brother, 
and I don't ever hold anything back for anyone. That's why I don't have an 
office at Geffen. I can go there, have my spats, come back to my office and be 
normal again." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hamilton, the ultimate mediator of A&amp;R spats is Geffen 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one more flexible than David Geffen. I had a problem this weekend, 
he talked to me on the phone for an hour on Sunday trying to resolve it for me. 
He's great, he's very funny. David Geffen's best line is, 'Vicky, I'm not a 
psychic, I'm just the keeper of the asylum. You have to tell me your problems 
in order for me to be able to deal with them.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zutaut is well aware that the bulk of Geffen's L.A.-based roster -- and by 
extension the "ears" of its young A&amp;R staff -- has yet to be tested. The 
debut album by Zutaut and Hamilton's Salty Dog has just been released, and the 
debuts of six other Geffen club bands will be coming out in the next few 
months: Nymphs (Zutaut), I Love You (Zutaut-Todd Sullivan), Little Caesar 
(Vukovic-Kalodner), Lock Up (Statman), the Brothers Figaro (Fenster) and 
Shadowland (Zutaut-Hamilton). 
</P>
<P>
The impact of most of these albums won't be known until well into the year. By 
then, the Geffen record division may well have been subdivided into two labels, 
each with its own A&amp;R and promotion staff. 
</P>
<P>
This second promotion force has been reportedly assembled in an apparent 
attempt to increase the chances of Geffen's non-hard-rock acts, which have had 
a significantly lower success rate than the label's rock bands. If the widely 
rumored split materializes, it would no doubt mean the break-up of the Gersh, 
Kalodner, Zutaut A&amp;R team. 
</P>
<P>
The move might also put the ambitious Zutaut another step closer to realizing 
the dream he's had for 15 years -- ever since, as a Park Forest, Ill., high 
schooler, he read a Rolling Stone article about David Geffen and decided to 
emulate the young record mogul. He speaks of someday running his own record 
company. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel like a kid in a candy store," Zutaut says. "I'm just waiting for 
the generation ahead of me to hand me the reins and say, 'Ride, captain, ride.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton wants her own record company too. Statman's goal is somewhat more 
modest. "I just need that one band to come find me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Will Geffen's night patrol find that the streets of Hollywood are still paved 
with platinum? Which inmates will be transferred to another Asylum? Ultimately, 
who will sink and who will swim? Will Zutaut and Hamilton get the chance to 
head their own labels? The answers are lurking somewhere in the L.A. night.

SCOUTING ROCK'S HOT NIGHTSPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Want to match wits with the record industry's street scouts? Here's a guide to 
the nightspots where you are most likely to find the best of the rock hopefuls 
around town. 
</P>
<P>
Coconut Teaszer (8117 Sunset Blvd., (213) 654-4773). A runaway winner in an 
informal poll of local tastemakers and scenesters, the 235-capacity Teaszer is 
praised for its relaxed atmosphere, but mostly for the high level of talent 
presented. Booker Len Fagan is so highly regarded as a judge of up-and-coming 
bands that he has received offers from several major labels to become an 
independent talent scout. Among his innovations: a biweekly showcase called 
"L.A.'s Best Kept Secrets," and "residencies," wherein particularly promising 
bands get weekly time slots for extended periods. Fagan estimates that nearly 
two dozen Teaszer regulars have been signed to label and publishing deals in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Best of the Rest 
</P>
<P>
Club Lingerie (6507 Sunset Blvd., (213) 466-8557). Veteran booker Brendan 
Mullen, another shrewd judge of raw talent, generally pairs out-of-town 
headliners with L.A. bands of commensurate quality. 
</P>
<P>
Bogart's (Marina Pacifica Mall, 6288 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Long Beach, 
(213) 594-8975). Steve Zepeda frequently presents the same national acts as the 
Lingerie, pairing them with young bands from the South Bay and Orange County, 
which makes the club a convenient stop for scouts who want to cover a lot of 
ground in a single evening. 
</P>
<P>
The Whisky (8901 Sunset Blvd., (213) 652-4202). Voted the best hard-rock club 
of the moment in the poll, primarily for Monday's "No Bozo Jam," featuring 
four-song sets by up to a dozen acts. However, Columbia Records' A&amp;R man 
Nick Terzo finds the atmosphere too "zoo-like" for his taste. Other nights are 
more variable in terms of talent. "It depends on which promoter is renting it 
out that night," says one pub crawler. 
</P>
<P>
The Roxy (9009 Sunset Blvd., (213) 276-2222). The comment about variable talent 
depending on which promoter rents the room also applies. Both the Roxy and 
Whisky -- two of Los Angeles' most historic clubs, are jointly owned and 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
Gazzarri's (9039 Sunset Blvd., (213) 273-6606). While the room, just up the 
street from the Roxy, is widely considered an unintentional parody of a rock 
club, several prominent bands, including Poison and Warrant, got their starts 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Also worth checking out are the "revolving clubs" -- the theme clubs that take 
over existing venues one night a week. The most notable: English Acid 
(Wednesdays at Peanuts, 7969 Santa Monica Blvd., (213) 654-0280, Xposeur 54 
(Sundays at Circus Disco, 6655 Santa Monica Blvd., (213) 462-1291) and the 
parade of events at Hollywood Live (6840 Hollywood Blvd., (213) 461-6266). BUD

BOY WOUNDED BY GANG BULLETS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy died early Saturday of a head wound he suffered five days 
earlier when alleged gang members opened fire at a rival in Pomona and hit the 
child instead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Daniel Rodriguez, died at Pomona Valley Community Hospital about 1:45 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a teen-ager arrested a day after the shooting on suspicion of 
attempted murder will be charged with the boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was not identified because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that a carload of males flashed gang hand signs Tuesday 
as they drove past the home where Daniel had been staying with his mother, then 
shouted a gang name and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, who was standing on the porch, was shot, along with a 23-year-old 
woman who also lived there. The woman, Olga Perez, was reported in good 
condition Saturday, recovering from a head wound. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, Marie Rodriguez, 23, said she had been staying with Perez's 
family for the past month, trying to escape her estranged husband's life style 
as a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, hours before the boy died, several hundred people carrying 
candles and signs marched in protest of the shooting through the drug- and 
gang-infested neighborhood in Pomona where it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
A record 44 homicides occurred last year in Pomona, most of them gang-related, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona police officers, meanwhile, opened a bank account to help pay for 
Daniel's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw (the boy) at the hospital,"Detective Allen Maxwell said. "It was tragic 
to see him lying there lifeless." 
</P>
<P>
Contributions to the funeral fund may be made by contacting the Pomona Police 
Department.

A motorist apparently ignored flashing signal lights at a Hawthorne railroad 
crossing and drove into the path of a freight train, killing a passenger in her 
car and injuring herself, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred late Friday on Southern Pacific railroad tracks at Van 
Ness Boulevard south of 120th Street, according to the California Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Patricia Knight, 19, of Inglewood, was taken to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center with unspecified injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they will seek vehicular manslaughter charges against Knight 
when she recovers. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of her 20-year-old passenger was not disclosed pending 
notification of relatives.

CLINIC PICKETED BY OPERATION RESCUE KEEPS DOORS SHUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Managers of an East Los Angeles family planning clinic decided to keep their 
doors shut Saturday after hundreds of Operation Rescue members staged an 
anti-abortion protest in front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Despite heavy rains, about 500 singing and praying Operation Rescue members 
lined the sidewalk in front of La Mejor Family Planning Clinic, 4055 Whittier 
Blvd., about 8 a.m, said Susan Finn, an Operation Rescue spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said about 150 pro-choice 
demonstrators also staged a counter-demonstration in front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said deputies were dispatched to the scene, but no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
"The manager at about 1:20 p.m. opted not to open the clinic for business," 
Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
La Mejor normally opens on Saturdays at 9 a.m. and usually performs an average 
of 20 to 25 abortions, Finn said.

Protestant and Roman Catholic soccer fans rioted despite tight security at a 
Belfast stadium and police fired plastic bullets into the stands to subdue the 
unruly crowd. The violence spilled into surrounding streets as buses were 
hijacked and set on fire. The police had formed a barrier between fans of 
Linfield, which has only Protestant players, and Donegal Celtic, from a 
Catholic neighborhood.

A group of supporters of Mayor Marion Barry gathered at a park in the nation's 
capital to rally and pray for the city's embattled leader, indicted on drug 
charges. Various ministers and elected officials spoke in support of Barry to 
nearly 300 supporters. The supporters were unanimous in their criticism of the 
federal government's use of Rasheeda Moore, a former model and friend of Barry, 
in the case against the mayor.

L.A. SCRAMBLES TO FIND MARKET FOR RECYCLABLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last two years, Los Angeles city officials have been designing what 
recycling experts say will be the largest and most sophisticated curbside 
trash-recycling plan in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Specially designed trucks, bins and cans will enable the city's sanitation 
crews to pick up, separate and haul hundreds of tons of recyclable trash daily 
from more than 720,000 households. The state-mandated recycling plan for Los 
Angeles is designed to cut in half the amount of garbage sent to rapidly 
filling city landfills. 
</P>
<P>
But now, as officials look toward a September kickoff date, there is just one 
hurdle left to jump: what to do with all the recyclable material once it is 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of Los Angeles directing half its daily 4,000 tons of household 
trash into the recycling market during the next two years has many recycling 
officials concerned that there may not be enough demand. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more California communities will inaugurate similar programs under 
recently signed state legislation requiring them to reduce their trash stream 
by 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
The law has caused city and state officials to scramble for ways to promote the 
use of recyclable materials before this wave of reusable trash hits the 
long-established, but often fragile, markets for used newspapers, glass 
bottles, plastic jugs and tin cans. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, these officials are considering legislation that would 
force government to buy more recycled material for its own use, provide tax 
credits to companies that use or process such materials, and subsidize 
recycling companies through grants, loans and even free land. 
</P>
<P>
The need to build markets for recycled materials was underscored by the recent 
experience of cities and states on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Markets there collapsed when a huge stream of recyclable material came on the 
market last year after state laws in New Jersey and New York required cities to 
begin recycling programs. Some municipal officials there report that they were 
able to sell their used newsprint for $45 a ton last year, but now must pay $18 
a ton just to have it hauled away. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, D.C., officials are stockpiling newsprint collected for 
recycling because they cannot find buyers at any price. Prices of most other 
recyclables, although still marketable, have tumbled. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast officials have good reason to fear that such worst-case scenarios 
could be played out here. In recent weeks, some California recyclers have taken 
their glass to landfills because, they said, supply has overwhelmed demand. 
Because California's recycled-paper market is so limited, a number of cities 
have looked to the Far East to handle their paper. A Los Angeles plan to sell 
city-generated paper to China fell through last year, and organizers blamed 
political upheaval there. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic industry is constantly searching for new ways to use recycled 
material. Everything from police billy clubs to ski jackets contain recycled 
plastic. Recycling turns old bottles and cans into new bottles and cans. Egg 
crates, speed bumps and commercial "animal bedding" also are manufactured with 
reused household trash. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide push for recycling programs is driven by concerns about 
environmental pollution and the increasing scarcity of landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in California, officials fear that landfill rates will rise from 
$15-$20 a ton to $50 a ton. On Long Island, N.Y., landfill costs already exceed 
$100 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
"The future cost of landfilling is astronomical," said Joan Edwards, director 
of Los Angeles' recycling program. "Whatever the estimates are, triple them and 
they still won't come close." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who helped create a household-recycling program in New York City 
before taking her Los Angeles post in November, said it is necessary to build a 
consistent supply of recyclables before attempting to develop new markets. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to get government commitment (to recycling) is to lock them into 
a collection system they can't walk away from," Edwards said. "Who better than 
municipalities to subsidize the market in the short haul?" 
</P>
<P>
But now, with the state-required program, the day has arrived when market 
development must begin, according to Edwards and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent a lot of time on collection efforts," said Lee Wiegandt, president 
of the California Glass Recycling Corp., an industry trade group. "If we don't 
start paying attention to the end-use market now, we'll pay the piper later." 
</P>
<P>
When fully implemented over a two-year period, the Los Angeles program will 
dwarf all other existing recycling programs in the state, industry officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The city's pilot program involves about 92,000 households, making it already 
one of the largest efforts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials have projected that the citywide effort will produce 
about 90,000 tons of glass to be recycled. That would represent a 26% increase 
in the total for the entire state in 1989, when 350,000 tons were collected, 
Wiegandt said. "It's frightening," he said of the projected increase. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' recycling program would generate about 100,000 tons of newspapers 
annually, according to city projections. That represents about a 35% increase 
in the total annual newspaper exports from the Port of Long Beach, the largest 
single port for used newsprint in the world, according to industry figures. 
</P>
<P>
These projections are causing officials in smaller cities to wonder where Los 
Angeles will market its recyclables. "It's going to be such a deluge on the 
market," said Joy Hamilton, administrative officer for the Burbank Public Works 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, about 20 communities have curbside recycling programs. 
Money raised through sale of the recyclable material usually offsets the 
increased costs of the program, and in some cities, such as Santa Monica, it 
turns a net profit. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles planners have projected that the recycling program will cost about 
$46 million a year for the first five years, with an estimated $13 million a 
year raised through the sale of recyclable material and reduced landfill costs. 
The remainder will be raised through city taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be scary for small towns, that L.A. will lock up the market," Edwards 
said. She said that some recycling companies may ask themselves, "Why deal with 
20 small towns, when you can deal with one big city?" 
</P>
<P>
But Edwards said her intention is not to carve up the market to suit the city 
of Los Angeles. "The health of the market depends on all of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City and industry officials hope that state and federal legislation will help 
create and support markets. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to have to be some supporting legislation," said Brian Austin, 
recycling coordinator for the city of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking to these bills (legislation) to pick up the slack in demand," 
said Jon Root, marketing specialist for the Santa Monica recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government, the state of California, Los Angeles County, the city 
of Los Angeles and many other municipalities already have a host of laws and 
administrative guidelines designed to encourage the use of products with some 
recycled content. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are encouraged to use a wide variety of recycled material, 
including paper, motor oil and paving materials, said John Arlington, chief 
counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee, 
which recently held 10 hearings on recycling markets. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are so many waivers and outs that it's really just a suggestion that 
they use recycled products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other laws require certain industries to begin reusing some of their own 
products. Newspaper publishers, for instance, are required under California law 
to use newsprint with a 50% recycled content in at least 25% of their product 
by 1994. (The Times far exceeds those requirements. Currently, 80% of its 
newsprint consists of 50% recycled paper.) 
</P>
<P>
New York state has formed an office of recycling markets development, with a 
$5.5-million budget for grants and low-cost loans to companies seeking to test 
new recycled products and processes. 
</P>
<P>
Without taking markets into consideration, some government collection programs 
have run into problems. For example, recyclers and glass manufacturers say the 
California returnable bottle law is the cause of recent upheaval in the West 
Coast glass market. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "2020" program -- known by its state Assembly bill number -- set 
minimum prices for glass, aluminum and plastic containers to make it economical 
for companies to operate collection centers. But manufacturers say the price 
for recycled glass, $94 a ton, is much higher than the $60 a ton they would pay 
for the equivalent raw material. 
</P>
<P>
Wiegandt of the glass manufacturers' trade group said, "Any time you set an 
artificial price, you are going to run into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Recyclers say that the manufacturers have been refusing to accept delivery of 
recyclable glass, citing color contamination from mixing clear, green and brown 
bottles. But recyclers say the real reason is that the manufacturers do not 
want to pay the high price required under the law. State legislation requires 
glass manufacturers to repurchase some of their product through recycling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Glassmakers deny they are rejecting more loads. A spokesman for Owens Brockway 
Corp., one of the largest glass manufacturers in the state, said the company 
rejects less than 4% of all loads and rejected less in 1989 than the prior 
year. Industry figures show that total usage of recycled glass is up. 
</P>
<P>
Coy Smith of San Diego Recyclers said he dumped 40 tons of glass in a landfill 
last month after having it rejected by glassmakers and lacking any other viable 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, Smith said, low-quality, mixed-color glass would be salable to 
fiberglass makers. But in-state fiberglass companies have abandoned the market 
since the minimum state prices were imposed last year, according to Wiegandt 
and others in the business. 
</P>
<P>
Developing new markets and local recycling facilities often face obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
Community Recycling &amp; Resource Recovery, a Sun Valley recycler, developed a 
method of processing used newsprint into a paper pulp substitute. In an effort 
to make the product more economical to ship and broaden its market, the company 
sought to build a drying plant to reduce water content in the material, 
according to Michael O'Reily, a consultant to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
But the Air Quality Management District vetoed the idea because of its high 
energy use and resulting pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The wait for new processing plants envisioned by recycling officials could be a 
long one. 
</P>
<P>
Rand Burgner, deputy executive director of the North Hempstead, N.Y., Solid 
Waste Management Authority, said there was similar talk back East, but "I don't 
see anyone breaking ground. There's a hell of a lot of talk about new plants, 
but to build (processing facilities requires) a long, arduous and expensive 
environmental impact report procedure to get permission for construction. It's 
years away. It's going to get worse before it gets better."

AS CALIFORNIA AGONIZES, OTHERS LIVE WITH MEDFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HILO, Hawaii 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While California debates how best to attack a stubborn infestation of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, the option of eradication already has bypassed this 
tropical state and most other agricultural producing regions of the world, 
forcing farmers to find ways to coexist with the feared pest. 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, Central America, Israel and elsewhere, the permanent establishment 
of the Medfly has not meant wholesale destruction of farming. And in some 
cases, agriculture actually has prospered alongside the pest. At the same time, 
the pest has brought hardships for both farmers and consumers: increased, 
regular applications of pesticides, marketing difficulties that can both raise 
prices and trim profits, and the everyday presence of worms in certain 
home-grown fruits. 
</P>
<P>
On these tropical islands, the Medfly is cited as one of several reasons for 
agriculture's failure to diversify into crops other than pineapple and sugar 
cane, which are not susceptible to the fruit flies. Residents also lament the 
difficulty of growing soft fruits without pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
Oki Matsuura, 69, who was born and reared on this largest of the Hawaiian 
islands, remembers going into the highlands as a boy to gather wild fruit: 
mangoes, mountain apple and guava. "Oh, it was so sweet and delicious," he 
recalled, smiling at the memory. Now the fruit is so wormy that Matsuura no 
longer bothers to pick it. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of Hawaii and other Medfly-plagued regions might prove valuable 
to California. Some scientists believe that California must begin to learn how 
to live with the pest: Not only have new infestations occurred regularly over 
the last decade, but the public seems to be growing weary of the pesticide 
spraying programs that have been needed to eradicate the pest. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to California farming, comparisons to other regions can be 
tricky. There is no infested nation with agriculture as large or as varied as 
that of California, which produces more than half the nation's fresh fruit and 
vegetables. Officials of the California Department of Food and Agriculture and 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture have warned of devastation to agriculture 
and serious economic ramifications should the pest become established in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the experiences of other infested regions suggest that the dire 
predictions might be overstated. 
</P>
<P>
In Central America, for example, the Medfly is merely one of many problems, and 
not the worst, facing agriculture, concluded a 1977 study of the pest's impact 
there by university scientists and officials of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Coffee, grown in many Central-American countries, is a prime 
Medfly target, but coffee beans are largely unaffected by the pest because it 
infests the blossom rather than the bean itself. 
</P>
<P>
"While this ubiquitous insect has a bad reputation and occurs in over 90 
countries, people have learned to live with it," the team of researchers said 
in their report. "Some of these countries export fruit with prescribed 
treatments to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the villain's reputation has been both overstated and overrated." 
</P>
<P>
The experience of Israel, too, can offer some reassurance. A centrally run 
aerial pesticide spraying program has minimized damage to citrus and stone 
fruits such as peaches and plums. Fortunately for Israel, its major export 
market, Europe, does not require post-harvest treatment to guarantee pest-free 
fruit because the Medfly already exists on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been living with the Medfly since the beginning of the century, and we 
have agriculture," said Yoram Roessler, chief of Citrus Agro-Technical 
Services, a subsidiary of the Citrus Marketing Board of Israel. "It's just 
another pest, a very serious pest, but it's controlled to the level that we 
have almost no infested fruit in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Israel exports citrus, a Medfly host, to the United States and Japan, as well 
as to Europe. To meet U.S. quarantine requirements, the fruit is subjected to 
cold temperatures during shipping. Roessler estimates that the Medfly increases 
citrus growers' costs by about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's citrus orchards are treated an average of six times a year with a 
malathion bait spray, he said, while stone fruits are sprayed as many as eight 
times. He added that virtually "nothing" is lost in yields in sprayed orchards. 
</P>
<P>
"We control it quite nicely, but it's still a pain in the neck," Roessler said. 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide, he said, can be applied selectively to prevent destruction of 
natural pest control programs, which include the use of beneficial insects. 
"But of course there must be some disruption," he added. "No question about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Here in Hawaii, the experience of growers have been both problematic and 
promising. The Medfly was introduced here at the turn of the century and 
rapidly proliferated. But then another pest, the Oriental fruit fly, invaded in 
the mid-1940s and pushed the Medfly out of its niche and into higher 
elevations. Today the Oriental and the melon fly pose greater threats to 
agriculture than does the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Economically, the Medfly is not of immediate concern" because the other flies 
do most of the damage, said Po-Yung Lai, plant industry administrator for the 
Hawaii Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to population density and shipping and labor costs, the various 
fruit flies are blamed for this state's need to import most of its produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course you can adjust to anything. . ," said Gene Gilmore, director of the 
USDA's tropical fruit and vegetable research laboratory in Honolulu. "But run 
down and take a look at Safeway and some of the fruit prices." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to keep out the fruit flies, the U.S. mainland requires all 
susceptible commodities imported from infested regions either to be picked at 
certain times or to undergo post-harvest treatment or both. In some fruit, 
these requirements can diminish quality. 
</P>
<P>
Because export-bound papayas must be picked hard and green, before the fly can 
lay its eggs in them, the fruit that leaves here is not as sweet or as 
flavorful as the papayas grown for domestic consumption. Moreover, the hot 
water treatment required for exporting papayas has driven up costs by at least 
15%, according to a spokesman for a major tropical fruit company here. 
</P>
<P>
Although papayas are an important export fruit, Hawaii's soft fruits are more 
susceptible to the fly. Some residents complain that they typically lose half 
of their back-yard peaches to the pest. 
</P>
<P>
"If you bite into a peach, you can expect maggots pretty much," said Clark 
Hashimoto, a county agricultural extension agent on the island of Maui. "(The 
Medfly) loves peaches more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike peaches, locally grown persimmons are sold in markets here. But 
malathion is not registered for use on the Hawaiian crop, and the Medfly will 
destroy as much as 25% of it before harvest, Hashimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the fruit is not destroyed, growers must contend with embargoes 
imposed by importing nations that want to keep out the pest. Agricultural 
officials tend to agree that the Medfly's most serious repercussion in Hawaii 
is not peach or persimmon losses, but the inability of the state to develop a 
potentially lucrative export market on the U.S. mainland for tropical fruit. 
There are no approved post-harvest treatments for many of them. 
</P>
<P>
"The fruit fly isn't the problem," said farmer Eric Weinert, who grows such 
exotic fruits as star fruit, longan, lychee, rambutan, cherimoya and atemoya. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't spray anything. I harvest at the appropriate time, and I keep clean 
fields. If we could export, I think the fruit would be widely grown." 
</P>
<P>
Weinert, who grew up in Newport Beach and still shows his allegiances in the 
Los Angeles Laker T-shirt he wears, maintains that Hawaii's climate is so ideal 
for tropical fruit that the state would have a strong advantage over other 
sellers. Export restrictions, however, have forced him to sell primarily to 
luxury hotels that cater to tourists hankering for a taste of the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its pests, Hawaii is a hotbed of research into fruit flies, and some 
of this research may soon resolve Weinert's export problems and also provide 
answers for California if it is forced to live with the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
In long, low buildings covered with metal roofs, researchers in Hilo inject 
various kinds of fruit with fly eggs and then try to kill off the pests inside 
by exposing the fruit to extreme temperatures or wrapping it in plastic to 
smother the insect. The challenge is to kill off the bugs without pesticide and 
without severely damaging the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
John Armstrong, an entomologist with the USDA's research service here, believes 
treatments that will enable growers to ship more tropical fruit to the mainland 
are only a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next two or three years, we will have developed a number of 
different quarantine treatments, hopefully for lychees, longan, rambutan and 
atemoya, " Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Post-harvest treatments would be vital to California's ability to export many 
types of fruit and vegetables should its farmlands become infested. According 
to the California Department of Food and Agriculture, which is managing the 
aerial spraying program in Southern California, the state's Medfly-susceptible 
products would be barred from the nation's warmer, fruit-growing states, 
including Florida, Georgia, Arizona and Texas, unless the commodities underwent 
USDA-approved treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Most agricultural specialists said such a barrier would come down fairly 
quickly -- in one to three years -- because the best of measures would not be 
able to contain the infestation in California, and other states soon would be 
visited by the pests. 
</P>
<P>
The longer-term challenge would be in treating products exported to nations 
such as Japan, which requires special treatments for commodities coming from 
infested regions. The United States and New Zealand are now the only major 
commodity exporters without fruit fly problems. 
</P>
<P>
Developing adequate post-harvest treatments that would kill the pest and still 
protect the quality of California's exports could be costly and take time. 
Treatment can damage some fruit and vegetables and reduce their shelf-life. 
Unlike farmers in most other nations, California growers might also face 
greater restrictions on pesticide use because of relatively stringent state 
environmental regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than switch to varieties of crops that would be less susceptible to the 
Medfly and less vulnerable to the effects of post-harvest treatments, 
California growers are looking to Hawaii for the weapons they believe will head 
off the much-dreaded infestation of California farmlands: sterile Medflies and 
Medfly parasites. 
</P>
<P>
On the island of Oahu, the California Department of Food and Agriculture pulled 
former USDA entomologist Nori Tanaka out of retirement in 1982 to produce 
sterile Medflies. Sterile flies have been effective in eradicating relatively 
small Medfly infestations with only minimal pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Tanaka, who is widely praised for his "green thumb with flies," breeds 100 
million of the insects a week in a cluster of ramshackle buildings in an 
industrial park in Honolulu. The flies' sexual "perfume" and the decomposing 
protein the flies are fed permeate the buildings -- and even the parking lot -- 
with an overpowering, nauseating stench of rot that clings to clothing after 
only minutes and causes some visitors to faint. Radiation is used to sterilize 
the flies. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Tanaka's prideful ministerings, his warehouses are too small to produce 
enough flies to combat the current Southern California infestation. California 
agricultural officials are hoping that public opposition to aerial spraying 
will not halt the eradication effort before two new rearing laboratories on 
Oahu are put into full production, including a much larger, high-tech facility. 
</P>
<P>
That lab, which looks like a palace next to Tanaka's humble warehouse, opened 
last month and will be able to produce 500 million flies a week later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sterile flies, parasites offer promise. In a recent 
demonstration project on the island of Maui, small wasps that are harmless to 
humans but deadly to Medfly larvae were credited with helping reduce twentyfold 
the population of an isolated pocket of Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii will soon embark on an even more ambitious demonstration project to 
eradicate the fruit flies with sterile insects from the island of Kauai. Public 
opposition has prevented aerial malathion spraying in Hawaii, and several 
skeptical scientists believe the state's infestation is too entrenched ever to 
be eradicated from the islands, with or without spraying. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of much hope that the Medfly can be driven out, residents have 
resigned themselves to its vagaries. Tanaka, for example, says he regularly 
eats home-grown fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes," he said, matter-of-factly. "Worms don't bother me anymore."

ARCHITECTURE: SPLASHES OF WHIMSY AMID ANTIQUES ORNAMENT A RE-CREATED 
19TH-CENTURY VICTORIAN HOME IN CARLSBAD.

<TEXT>
<P>
One's abiding passions in life do bring moments of curious disadvantage, which 
is a suitably empurpled Victorian way of expressing just what Patricia Watkins 
feels sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
She feels that way when she peers from the widow's watch of her lavishly 
re-created 19th-Century home on the coast of Carlsbad and observes how 
passers-by act when they come upon the home and spy its tall cupola, witch's 
hat and virtual dessert tray of gingerbread ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Watkins recalled, "these people pulled up and took a tablecloth out. They 
had champagne, a bucket, a flower vase and a little ghetto blaster. They 
danced, they kissed. They set up a tripod and a camera and took pictures of 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Life can be like that when your home is dubbed "Disneyland South" by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Gawkers, shutter-snappers and occasional folks who simply knock on the door for 
a well-meaning inquiry are the price Watkins, her husband, William, and their 
six children are willing to pay for owning one of the most unusual and most 
prominent residences on Southern California's coast. 
</P>
<P>
Lyn Pinney of the Carlsbad Convention and Visitors Bureau said, "It's pretty 
outstanding. If you drive up the coast, you don't find many homes like it. In 
fact, I can't think of any." 
</P>
<P>
But only three years after the couple finished building their dream house, 
business demands are requiring them to spend more time in Las Vegas, where they 
lived before. So they put their Carlsbad Victorian on the market four months 
ago. The asking price is $3 million including the antique furnishings, or $2.5 
million without. 
</P>
<P>
So far, according to the Watkinses' real estate agent, 225 parties have 
expressed interest in the three-story, 14-room blue-gray residence with 
burgundy and plum trim that was hand-milled from redwood. But most potential 
buyers want to convert the house into a bed-and-breakfast inn for tourists, and 
they disappear upon learning the city won't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is taking the sorrow out of selling their house by planning to erect 
an almost exact duplicate in Las Vegas, where 19th-Century architecture is 
about as natural as fully clothed showgirls. 
</P>
<P>
But for the Watkinses, their long-held affinity for a style popular during the 
long reign of England's Queen Victoria -- a style most later generations 
regarded as silly and dandified -- goes wherever they go. 
</P>
<P>
William Watkins is a well-known Carlsbad-area developer, and Patricia is a 
former art teacher who specialized in portraits. They married 10 years ago, 
creating a perfect union for collect-aholics who decided to design and furnish 
a Victorian retirement home with a sea view. 
</P>
<P>
First, she recounted, the couple set about searching for the house that would 
be right for them -- to copy. 
</P>
<P>
"We took an extensive tour of Victorian homes in Northern California" that 
included stops in Ferndale, Eureka and Arcata in redwood country, she said. 
They also scrutinized San Francisco's "painted ladies," but decided the 
architecture "was more pure in Ferndale because it's more rural" and thus 
hadn't been modified over the years. They blended the designs of several homes 
they had seen when they began building theirs. 
</P>
<P>
They began two years of building in 1984. Neighbors in Terramar, a 1950s-era 
residential enclave just south of the Encinitas power plant, watched the 
construction with considerable amusement. 
</P>
<P>
"People were calling it 'Disneyland South,' " recalled Bailey Noble, president 
of the local homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
When the house was done, raised to its full 35-foot height, perhaps the most 
impressed observer was the city's building inspection department. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all 2-by-6 lumber studding. It's way overbuilt; you wouldn't believe it," 
said Tony Mata, chief building inspector. "I had to take my whole department 
down there to see it. They were amazed." 
</P>
<P>
Although somewhat crowded on a 69-by-105-foot lot, the Watkinses' abode has a 
feeling of spaciousness and warmth inside. Actual 19th-Century homes had cold, 
tiny rooms with high ceilings, but modern-day building codes and a desire for 
comfort caused the family to choose bigger rooms, each crowded with antique 
furniture, lamps, stained-glass windows, art and curios. 
</P>
<P>
But amid all the antiquity -- the 1870 parlor stove and the authentic Tiffany 
window and much more -- are splashes of pure whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
In the second-story office sit two late-1800s barber chairs at the windows 
overlooking the ocean. William and Patricia sit there and gaze. But her chair 
also has a more practical use. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit here and blow my hair dry and watch the people go by," she said. 
</P>
<P>
People with modern taste usually regard Victoriana as gaudy and foppish. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all of those things," said Patricia Watkins. But "you look at something 
like a piece of furniture and you think, look what's happened over the last 100 
years, and this is still here. . . . It's just so good to feel there was 
something yesterday."

REGULATORY BOARD'S HUE AND CRY MAY UNRAVEL WOMAN'S PLAN TO GROW NATURALLY 
COLORED COTTON

<P>
Build a better mousetrap, and the world may beat a path to your door. 
</P>
<P>
But breed a brilliant cotton, and you're in for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Sally Fox. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 34, has revived the ancient Incan science of growing naturally colored 
cotton -- a fluffy fiber that bursts from its bolls in shades of brown and 
green and, she hopes someday soon, pinks and blues. Customers already are 
lining up to buy as much as she can grow. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, the state of California won't let her grow very much of it. And 
in the future, it may not let her grow any at all. 
</P>
<P>
To defend its reputation for growing some of the best cotton in the country, 
California has a strict "one-variety" rule that is enforced by the Acala Cotton 
Board. That regulation lets the established growers who sit on the board use 
the force of law to forbid competitors to grow any cotton other than the Acala 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
Acala is a brilliant white "medium-staple" variety of cotton -- that is, it has 
long, fine, strong fibers that spin easily into thread. Acala also is easily 
dyed and grows well in the soil and weather conditions of the southern San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The one-variety rule was bent last year to accommodate growers who are rushing 
to plant an even finer cotton variety called Pima. But the cotton board voted 9 
to 3 late last year against a similar exemption that would let Fox grow 
commercial quantities of her new colored cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's cotton has shorter, weaker fibers than Acala. The cotton board fears that 
if too much colored cotton is planted in California, it may mix with Acala, 
reducing its whiteness or fiber quality and hurting the state's reputation 
among buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Fox -- supported by other growers and researchers -- disputes this. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton board decisions "are destroying my business," sighed Fox, who has a 
graduate degree in entomology, the study of insects, and who started breeding 
colored cotton as a hobby in 1982. She added, "It's very frustrating, and not 
very smart." 
</P>
<P>
Squeezed between the Acala Cotton Board, which says it cannot by law permit 
anybody to plant what it argues is an inferior variety on more than a 160-acre 
test plot, and a growing customer list that includes amateur weavers and giant 
corporations, Fox said she may have to leave California, the country's 
second-largest cotton producing state. 
</P>
<P>
It is, she said, as if the state allowed IBM to tell Apple Computer that it was 
not welcome in California because its proposed new product might upset the 
established market. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, the country's leading cotton state, is wooing Fox with technical aid and 
grant offers, and she test-planted 80 acres outside Lubbock last year. But Fox, 
a fourth-generation Californian, said she prefers to find a way to remain 
working, living and experimenting in the small San Joaquin Valley farm town of 
Wasco, about 27 miles northwest of Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
From there, on a typewriter perched in the living room of the modest rented 
house that serves as headquarters for Fox's one-person company, Natural Cotton 
Colours Inc., she appealed the cotton board's Nov. 28 decision to deny her 
request to plant 2,000 acres of colored cotton. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Voss, director of the state Department of Food and Agriculture, said Jan. 
5 that neither he nor Gov. George Deukmejian would reverse the decision of the 
established growers who sit on the board. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 23, the cotton board voted to let Fox continue growing only on her 
160-acre "test plot." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do," Fox said. "Some people said I should wait for the 
state to change its mind -- or its law -- but others say I have a head start 
and I should move and take advantage of it (by going to Texas) rather than let 
someone catch up to me." 
</P>
<P>
Independent cotton breeders and federal cotton researchers credit Fox with 
making colored cotton commercially viable by cross-breeding it with other 
varieties to improve its fibers. That made the cotton compatible with new, 
high-speed, automated spinning machines. 
</P>
<P>
Fox appreciates the accolades but said the cotton board's decision stops her 
from enjoying the fruits of her research -- and could let other, better 
capitalized growers catch up to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be miles ahead of the field," she said, "but they won't let me." 
</P>
<P>
Several other growers in Buttonwillow, Visalia and other San Joaquin Valley 
cotton towns said they support Fox, but they declined to go on the record for 
fear of offending the cotton board, which also regulates their operations. 
</P>
<P>
"It (colored cotton) doesn't reduce the quality of California cotton -- and 
that's been proven," one man said. He said that when managed properly, colored 
cotton "doesn't cross-breed (with white cotton), it doesn't contaminate the 
gins, it doesn't do anything bad." 
</P>
<P>
"We grow all kinds of specialty niche crops here in California -- kiwis and I 
don't know what else," the grower continued. "California is famous for it. But 
they won't allow this. It's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Cotton board members say they have no choice. California's one-variety law 
flatly prohibits the introduction of "inferior" varieties. While some people 
may argue that color makes Fox's cotton superior in one sense, the board said 
tests show its fiber quality just doesn't measure up to Acala. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Norman Clark, a cotton grower, said the board may ask the 
Legislature this year to amend the law to permit "niche" varieties such as 
Fox's. Without that, he said, the board may have to withdraw all permission for 
colored cotton. 
</P>
<P>
"They (board members) are really breaking the rules by letting her grow any 
colored cotton here at all," he said. "The law says that breeders with test 
plots here are supposed to work on new Acala varieties, and hers aren't." 
</P>
<P>
Fox became interested in colored cotton while she was living in San Diego and 
pursuing her hobby of hand-spinning yarn. She chose to investigate colored 
cotton as a potential cash crop when other hand-spinners also displayed 
interest in the curious material. Word of mouth about her colored cotton spread 
so fast among her friends and their friends that she started selling it by 
mail. That mail-order business now supports her while she tries to develop a 
broader market. 
</P>
<P>
The Palo Alto native and Peace Corps veteran, while working on non-chemical 
agricultural pest-control methods at a San Diego laboratory, set up a nascent 
base in Kern County by driving up to Wasco on weekends and bunking down with 
friends while tending one-acre test plots. 
</P>
<P>
She initially planted brown seeds given to her by a former employer, also a 
cotton breeder, and expected to see one consistent shade of brown cotton lint. 
Instead, she saw tans and medium browns, a sage green and even a weak pink. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought, 'Oh, no. There goes my business,"' she said. "Well, 
actually, I was really excited. All the colors! It was like nothing else I had 
ever seen -- or even heard about." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Fox's desire to stay in the southern San Joaquin Valley is that the 
area is naturally low in cotton crop pests. This makes it easier to pursue her 
parallel dream of producing "organic" cotton -- that is, cotton grown without 
pesticides or the defoliants that have become so controversial in California's 
cotton country. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing colored lint, the cotton varieties being developed by 
Fox have retained much of the inherent insect resistance of their semi-wild 
ancestors. She said this reduces, and may someday eliminate, the need for 
pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the colored lint is less easily ruined by green stains it can pick up 
from its own leaves when both pass through a mechanical harvester. This 
eliminates the need for the costly and controversial defoliation that growers 
now use to strip cotton plants of their leaves before harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Such features obviously were not of concern to the Incas who developed colored 
cotton centuries ago. Anthropologists believe they developed the colors for the 
same reason people today dye white cotton: decoration. But the colored 
varieties were forgotten as merchants perfected dyes, which came in more colors 
and allowed greater flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
A University of Texas anthropology student helped revive interest in colored 
cotton when he brought back samples of it from Peru in 1981. He discovered 
colored cotton after admiring, and being told the source of, the naturally 
colored clothes of Peruvian peasants. 
</P>
<P>
University of Arizona scientist Lee Stith said Fox, whose work he and his 
colleagues have watched with interest, is the first person in the United States 
he knows of who grows colored cotton commercially. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a neat little product that really caught the hearts of the people 
working here," said John Price, assistant director of Texas Tech University's 
Textile Research Center, which Fox hired to test her fiber for strength, color 
and "spinability," or the ability to be made into thread and cloth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the best in the world," Price said, "but its appeal is that it is a 
naturally colored cotton, and any defects (in cloth made from it) are 
relatively minor and academic." 
</P>
<P>
Fox is working to improve her cotton by breeding it with Sea Island and Acala 
varieties. In that way, she hopes to improve her cotton's fiber quality, which 
is critical in deciding its ultimate acceptability among growers. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult hurdle with established growers is convincing them why anyone 
would want naturally colored cotton in the first place, particularly because 
colored cotton varieties yield as little as one-fifth the number of bales per 
acre as the high-yield -- and easily dyed -- Acala strain. 
</P>
<P>
Fox and her supporters have their theories. 
</P>
<P>
One is that naturally colored cotton is novel and catchy enough to appeal to 
upscale consumers who drink expensive bottled water and prefer imported cars 
over domestic sedans. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that it might appeal to narrow specialty markets, such as people 
allergic to the harsh dyes used to color white cotton or hand-spinners who can 
mix colored cottons to achieve marble-like effects not otherwise possible. 
</P>
<P>
A third is that some growers, ginners and mill owners envision the day when 
strict antipollution laws may severely restrict the use not only of pesticides 
and other farm chemicals, but also limit use of commercial dyes that have been 
blamed for fouling the environment when garment makers dump their wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton mills on three continents already have shown an interest in obtaining as 
much of Fox's colored cotton as possible so they can investigate its uses. 
</P>
<P>
Fox recently sold her 1989 crop, a modest 122 bales of 500 pounds each, through 
a Canadian broker to a mill in Japan. The company said it would buy as much as 
Fox could grow, but she is limited by the cotton board to the 160-acre test 
plot. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such shortcomings, Fox said she sold her cotton for enough money to 
compensate for its low yield. She declined to release specific figures, saying 
they are proprietary information that could help a competitor, but a reputable 
cotton broker familiar with the deal confirmed her claim. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that it is known how valuable this is, it invites competition," said Fox, 
her normal cheerfulness sinking into anxiety. "I still don't feel strong enough 
to compete (with veteran growers more familiar with the cotton market). I still 
have too many mistakes to make and lessons to learn."

SILBERMAN IS FOUND, HOSPITALIZED IN VEGAS; 
</P>
<P>
SEARCH: POLICE SAY MISSING FINANCIER, WHO IS FACING TRIAL ON FEDERAL 
MONEY-LAUNDERING CHARGES, WAS UNCONSCIOUS IN HOTEL ROOM.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after he disappeared, San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman was 
located by police late Saturday afternoon in a Las Vegas hotel room, where he 
was found unconscious and lying fully clothed on the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Randy Oaks, a Las Vegas police spokesman, said one of his detectives used a 
passkey to enter the fifth-floor room at the posh Las Vegas Hilton about 5:15 
p.m. after Silberman, a former state Democratic Party official under indictment 
on federal money-laundering charges, failed to come to the door. 
</P>
<P>
"The detective found Mr. Silberman lying in an unconscious state on the bed and 
brought him to a conscious state," Oaks said. "Then he summoned medical 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
Although a San Diego police spokesman speculated that Silberman was under the 
influence of "some kind of substance," Las Vegas authorities said Saturday 
night that it was unclear if that was the case. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada in Las Vegas, 
where Silberman was listed in serious but stable condition, were still 
performing toxicology tests late Saturday night. He was expected to remain in 
the medical center overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"Our detective found nothing in the way of leftover residue, pills or anything 
of that nature," Oaks said. "It appeared to him that Mr. Silberman entered that 
room with nothing more than the clothes on his back." 
</P>
<P>
Oaks added that the detective did find a note in the room that Silberman had 
written, which the lieutenant would only describe as "a writing of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Silberman was alone when he checked into the room Thursday night, 
using his own name. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 60, a former official in Gov. Jerry Brown's Administration in the 
late 1970s, is scheduled to stand trial in April on federal money-laundering 
charges. He has experienced severe financial difficulties since his arrest 10 
months ago, and he could face up to 75 years in prison and a $2.75 million 
fine, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Las Vegas said Silberman's wife, Susan Golding, a son and 
daughter-in-law rushed there and joined him at the hospital Saturday night, 
along with his personal physician and criminal defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
They could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman vanished Thursday afternoon after he told his family that he was 
going to Orange County to have dinner and meet with an attorney. But he never 
made that meeting, and a missing person report was filed. 
</P>
<P>
He was last seen Thursday evening at San Diego's Lindbergh Field airport, where 
he purchased a ticket for a 6 p.m. flight to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
V. Wayne Kennedy, an administration official at UC San Diego, said Saturday 
that he saw Silberman at the airport Thursday evening "around 6 p.m. or a 
little before," but did not get the chance to speak to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was walking in the airport and I was walking out," Kennedy said. He added 
that Silberman was alone and did not appear to be preoccupied or distraught.

San Diego Police Cmdr. Larry Gore said police Friday could not determine 
whether Silberman boarded the plane to Los Angeles. But on Saturday, he said, 
police interviewed a person they declined to identify who saw Silberman at Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
By checking flight records, police learned that Silberman was traveling alone, 
under his own name. Detectives then traced him to Las Vegas. From there, San 
Diego and Las Vegas officers began checking hotel guest registers.

SUSPICIOUS NEW SHEEN SHOWS UP IN SPILL ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Rushing rainwater Saturday wiped out earthen dams protecting fragile coastal 
wetlands from the oil spill off Huntington Beach, but environmentalists said 
the storm might help scrub the shore of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard, meanwhile, reported seeing a new and different-looking sheen 
of oil on Bolsa Chica State Beach in Huntington Beach, raising suspicions that 
there was a new source of leakage. Samples of the oil were promptly sent to the 
Coast Guard's oil identification laboratory in Groton, Conn., for testing to 
determine whether it matched the crude spilled 11 days ago by a tanker mooring 
offshore near Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Because the oil spilled from the tanker had been drifting southward, officials 
were concerned to see the sheen on the north end of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth Neely said the sheen was spotted by Coast 
Guard pilots flying over the spill area throughout the day. Later, officials 
and workers on the ground also noticed it. 
</P>
<P>
"The consistency of this oil doesn't look the same and . . . the rest of the 
oil (from the tanker) seems to have drifted in a southerly direction," Neely 
said. "It raised enough suspicion that someone thought they should take a 
sample to see if it was from the same spill." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's violent winds and the cold, piercing rain played havoc with cleanup 
efforts, pushing a protective containment boom out to sea and sending workers 
in yellow slickers scurrying for cover. 
</P>
<P>
The storm washed away three temporary earthen dams that had been keeping 
oil-contaminated water from sensitive wetlands near the mouth of the Santa Ana 
River. And skimmers working off the coast to scoop up the remaining oil in the 
ocean halted their efforts because of the choppy seas, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the weather made work more uncomfortable for the most part, officials 
said it did not reverse progress made in getting the oil off the beaches and 
out of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
A boom protecting Newport Harbor, blown away by the storm, was not replaced 
when officials determined that a second boom -- which withstood the winds -- 
was sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
And environmentalists said it was good news that the sand berms at the mouth of 
the Santa Ana River washed away, because the rainwater washing out to sea would 
scrub out small amounts of oil that had leaked into marshlands. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a week, environmentalists and flood control officials had weighed 
the consequences of damming up the channels. While the aim of the dams was to 
keep contaminated water from flowing into sensitive, newly restored marshland, 
they could also cause flooding in a storm if waters from the swollen river and 
channels were not allowed to flow out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, as the raging waters of the river overwhelmed the dams, sweeping 
debris and even some oil that had leaked in back out into the ocean, 
environmentalists said they thought the dams had done their job in protecting 
the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of crude oil retained here and now that has washed out to 
sea," said Gordon Smith, director of the Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy. 
"Hopefully, there isn't any more oil out at sea that will come back." 
</P>
<P>
The spill on Feb. 7, which occurred when an anchor pierced the hull of the 
tanker American Trader, dumped 394,000 gallons of oil into the water. Since 
then, the oil has been washing ashore along nearly 20 miles of Orange County's 
coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Sacco, a spokesman for British Petroleum, owner of the oil aboard the 
tanker, said cleanup is in the final stages. Only 470 workers were patrolling 
the beaches on Saturday, down from 635 on Friday. Of those, 200 were working 
north of the Santa Ana River, mostly near the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier, 
with 270 others between the Santa Ana River and Laguna Beach, including 40 
south of Newport Beach's Balboa Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going to see 1,400 people on the beach anymore. You'll see crews 
along the lines of 300 to 400," Sacco said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the number of live birds found covered with oil had increased by 
26, bringing the total to 410. Another 51 were found dead, bringing that total 
to 275. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the bird rescue center in Huntington Beach announced that instead 
of training more volunteers to walk the beaches looking for birds, they have 
set up a 24-hour hot line for people to call if they find an oil-covered bird. 
Center personnel then will pick it up. The number is (714) 536-0202.

Israeli soldiers backed by helicopters raided a West Bank village and tracked 
down Palestinian fugitives in nearby caves, arresting more than 100 suspected 
uprising activists, the army and state radio said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, a 22-year-old Palestinian woman was killed Saturday morning 
by fellow Palestinians who accused her of helping Israeli authorities, Arab 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Ishanhaz Timraz, was murdered on the main street in the Gaza town of 
Rafah when she went to a U.N. relief office to get food supplies, Palestinian 
journalists and hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The military command confirmed the death and said it was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
More than 130 Arabs have been similarly slain in the 26-month uprising against 
Israeli rule in Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Gaza, Israeli troops shot and wounded at least six Palestinians in a 
number of stone-throwing clashes, Arab hospital officials said. The army said 
it knew of three Palestinians who suffered light injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The military command said soldiers raided the village of Yamun in the northern 
part of the occupied West Bank over the weekend. It did not say precisely when 
the raid took place. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, backed by air force helicopters, arrested about 90 Palestinians 
suspected of guerrilla activities and participation in violent protests, the 
army said. It said weapons such as axes, knives and sticks were found in the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said some Palestinians were captured in caves near the village, 
where they had fled. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted an unidentified army commander of the area as saying no shots were 
fired during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli authorities expelled from the country a 
Yugoslav woman suspected of spying for the PLO, the radio reported. Patricia 
Kansevitz, 26, was sent to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Kansevitz was arrested by Israeli security officials Jan. 7 along with another 
Yugoslav woman, Victoria David, 34. David, thought to be a convert to Judaism 
who emigrated to Israel in 1987, was charged on Jan. 28 with contact with a 
foreign agent, membership in an illegal organization and passing information to 
the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
The charge sheet alleged that she took photographs of military installations 
and strategic sites. 
</P>
<P>
According to the charge sheet, David went by the code name of "Halila" and was 
recruited in Yugoslavia into Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
mainstream branch headed by Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Kansevitz reportedly acted as a courier who transferred the information to the 
PLO.

<P>
Caught in a deadly ring of armor and artillery, Lebanon's main Christian 
militia lashed back Saturday at rival army forces, pouring tank fire on an 
isolated helicopter base. 
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Forces attack on an estimated 750 army defenders at the Adma base 
near Juniyah, north of Beirut, swung the two-week-long struggle to another 
front. 
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday, the warring Christian factions declared a cease-fire. Up to 
now, however, more than 10 such truces between the army troops of Maj. Gen. 
Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia of Samir Geagea have failed, and 
there were few hopes that any settlement was within sight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of the Adma base could cost Aoun 12 of his 18 Puma attack helicopters 
should his pilots be unable to fly them out. Meanwhile, according to an 
unconfirmed report carried by Beirut radio stations Saturday, the general's 
minuscule air force, four old British Hawker Hunters, were flown by defecting 
pilots to an air base under Syrian control. 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of such setbacks for Aoun could not erase the devastating 
defeat that the militia suffered Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 army infantrymen, backed by 36 tanks, Friday ground block by 
block, house by house, through the militia-controlled district of Ain Rummaneh 
in Christian East Beirut. At nightfall, according to press reports from the 
Lebanese capital, militia leader Geagea pulled out the last of his men. 
</P>
<P>
He then went on the radio of the rightist Falange Party, whose militiamen form 
the core of the Lebanese Forces, and appealed for help. "I call on all world 
powers and all spiritual and political leaderships, especially the legitimate 
ones, to resume their full responsibilities towards the country and its 
citizens," he implored in a message broadcast repeatedly by the Voice of 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
While outside powers with influence in Lebanon -- including France, the Vatican 
and the United States -- have demanded that renegade army commander Aoun break 
off his assault on the militia, none appears likely to intervene. Geagea's 
appeal appeared directed instead at "legitimate" forces, namely the Lebanese 
government headed by President Elias Hrawi and backed by a Syrian army of 
40,000 or more, the overwhelming military force in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi made no immediate response to Geagea's plea. But in Damascus, the Syrian 
capital, the authoritative Al Thawra newspaper declared again Saturday that 
President Hafez Assad's regime stands ready to support Hrawi, saying that 
Syrian troops are at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Some press reports from Beirut mentioned movements of Syrian units in the 
Lebanese mountains above Aoun's headquarters at Baabda on the outskirts of East 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"But ask yourself, why would the Syrians want to get into a very dirty fight 
among Christians," said a Nicosia-based diplomat Saturday. "Assad is not the 
sort to rush into a situation that can only smear his army, even in victory. 
This fight has no direct effect on him." 
</P>
<P>
The internecine struggle began at the end of January when Aoun, who has been 
sacked as army commander by Hrawi, demanded that the Lebanese Forces either 
disarm or join his ranks. The general appears utterly convinced of the justice 
of his beliefs -- that there should be no armed force within Lebanon except 
what he considers his army. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun speaks of the Lebanese Forces simply as "gunmen." In a country where no 
political party lacks a militia, the Falange has borne the brunt of the 
fighting against Muslim rivals over 15 years of civil war. But it has been no 
less combative against its Christian rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The party militia of the powerful Gemayel clan, Falange fighters took on the 
Tigers militia of the late Christian leader Camille Chamoun and the Giants of 
former President Suleiman Franjieh in the early years of the war. 
</P>
<P>
In a particularly vicious attack, Falange raiders killed Franjieh's son, Tony, 
his wife and their baby daughter. The raid was led by an up-and-coming 
militiaman named Samir Geagea. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun has declared war on all militias, which he accuses of usurping government 
authority, and has shown no reluctance to engulf Beirut in urban warfare to 
achieve his aim. His conquest of Ain Rummaneh tightens the ring of army power 
around the Lebanese Forces. The district lies south of the Museum Crossing, the 
main transit point through the Green Line separating Christian East from Muslim 
West Beirut. To the north of the crossing lie Geagea's last redoubts in the 
capital itself, the districts of Ashrafiyeh and Karantina. 
</P>
<P>
Press estimates put the number of dead in the 17 days of fighting at more than 
580, with 1,800 or more wounded. In last year's punishing artillery war between 
Aoun's loyalists and Syrian and Muslim militia gunners on the west, more than 
800 soldiers and civilians were reported killed, but that round of fighting 
lasted six months.

<TEXT>
<P>
Judging by the experience of Le Van Kim, the thousands of Vietnamese "boat 
people" who face forced repatriation from Hong Kong will encounter no official 
retribution when they return home, but a life of enduring adversity. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, when Nguyen Ngoc Son returned voluntarily to Haiphong last month 
from a camp in Hong Kong, he had to cope with little more, by his own account, 
than a wife embittered by his infidelity. His adjustment problems have been 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
The two men represent the two sides of a looming problem for the Vietnamese 
authorities: the reintegration into society of the thousands of boat people who 
have fled abroad only to face being returned as illegal economic emigres. There 
are 43,000 boat people in Hong Kong alone, and thousands more in Thailand, 
Malaysia and Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, 37, and seven members of his family were among the 51 Vietnamese who made 
up the first group of refugees sent back to Vietnam by the Hong Kong 
authorities last December. The repatriation caused such an outcry that Britain 
has suspended the practice, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
Kim had suffered an incredible run of bad luck even before he left Vietnam. He 
lost an arm in a fireworks explosion five years ago, his fishing business was 
ruined by two years of bad catches and his family arrived in Hong Kong in June, 
1988, just four days after Britain began screening out the so-called economic 
emigres. Shortly after arriving in Hong Kong, his mother died. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Haiphong, Kim, his wife, Le Thi The, and their six children have yet to 
find a place to live. They have been forced to accept the charity of a man who 
has two children in the Hong Kong camps. 
</P>
<P>
"The local government has helped us a lot," Kim said through an interpreter. 
"Still, I'm very sad." 
</P>
<P>
Kim's greatest problem is that his source of income, his fishing boat, was 
destroyed by Hong Kong authorities after he arrived in the British colony. A 
new boat would cost about $10,000, far beyond his means. 
</P>
<P>
The family subsists on local government payments of 100,000 Vietnamese dong a 
month for each family member, the equivalent of about $25 each, or $200 in all. 
This is a handsome sum by Vietnamese standards, but the assistance, which is 
underwritten by the British government, will last only a year. What will happen 
then is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's wife said she spent the recent Tet lunar New Year holiday in tears 
because the family had no home of its own and no prospects of getting one. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really feeling the hardship," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim seems devastated by the recent turn of events but bears no grudge against 
the British or the Vietnamese governments, which he said had kept a promise not 
to discriminate against him for leaving. He seems bitter only when talking 
about his current predicament. 
</P>
<P>
"Many delegations have come here and promised us help, but we haven't seen them 
again," he lamented. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hoang Ngoc Tri, deputy chairman of the Haiphong People's Council 
and the head of a committee for receiving refugees returning from Hong Kong, 
640 boat people have come to Haiphong since last year, about half of the total 
of 1,169 who have come back voluntarily and 51 who were forced back. 
</P>
<P>
Tri said there had been two cases in which boat people had been sent to prison 
after their return to Vietnam, but he insisted that these involved prison 
escapees who asked to be sent back to jail. It is a crime in Vietnam to flee 
the country, but there have been no known prosecutions in Haiphong. 
</P>
<P>
Nghiem Xuan Tue, a vice director of the Ministry of Labor, said in an interview 
that unemployment in 1988 reached 6 million people out of a working population 
of 32 million. But he maintained that a lot of boat people "are the children of 
rich families." 
</P>
<P>
Like Kim, Nguyen Ngoc Son is 37 years old, but when he fled to Hong Kong he 
left behind his wife and children. He said in an interview that his only reason 
for leaving was so that he could be with his girlfriend. Indeed, the woman, who 
has remained in Hong Kong, even paid for his passage out, about $250. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials appeared anxious to portray the boat people as being more 
like Son, suggesting that they left the country for frivolous reasons rather 
than the economic hardships experienced by Kim and his family. When a visitor 
expressed sympathy for Kim, a Haiphong city official retorted that he would not 
be in this predicament if he had stayed here. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't leave because I wanted a better life," Son said in an interview in 
his comfortable central Haiphong home, wearing a dapper corduroy sports jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Son said he volunteered to return to Vietnam even before the Hong Kong 
authorities considered his application. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I was doing something very wrong for my family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the paradoxes of the system is that Son, who returned voluntarily, is 
paid more than Kim. He gets 120,000 dong a month, a little less than $30, in 
addition to anything he can earn on his own. The volunteer return program is 
funded by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"People who have come back to our city have to realize that they have done 
wrong," said Tri, the People's Council official. "When they come back there is 
no discrimination against them, whether they volunteer or not." 
</P>
<P>
He agreed that the main problem for the returning boat people is economic, 
because most have sold everything they owned to pay for their voyage out. 
</P>
<P>
"They come back empty-handed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.N. subsidy is essential, he said, it falls short of what the 
city spends to help the refugees. As he described it, the world body pays 
Vietnam $560 for every voluntary return, and of this the government pays $360 
directly to the refugee. He said about 20% receive a living allowance, 4% get 
help with education, and 40% get help with furnishing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Tri said there are still distinctions between those who volunteered to come 
back and those who were forced back. For ideological reasons, the government 
describes the former as "volunteers" and the deported group as people who "did 
not protest" their return.

Four children were found dead in their beds Saturday in the town of Basildon 
and police said they had apparently been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
Kam Tong Ngai, the father of the three boys and one girl aged 4 months to 5 
years, discovered the bodies when he came home from his job at a Chinese 
restaurant, said police in Basildon, about 25 miles east of London. 
</P>
<P>
The mother of the children, Oitai Ngai, a 32-year-old Hong Kong native, was 
being questioned, police said, but no charges had been filed against her.

Snow blanketed much of the nation from New England to the Pacific Northwest on 
Saturday, while the Southeast cleaned up from a wave of thunderstorms and 
devastating tornadoes that killed two people and sent hundreds fleeing from 
rising floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
A winter storm warning remained in effect for interior parts of western 
Washington state, where up to 12 inches of snow fell between Whidbey Island and 
Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
Strong winds brought the wind chills to near zero in many locations. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered showers fell over the Southeast, where a day earlier severe 
thunderstorms roamed and tornadoes ripped through Cooper, Daleville and Ft. 
Rucker, Ala.; Irmo, S. C., and Carrollton, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
About 38 homes were destroyed or damaged in Carrollton, and 12 people were 
hospitalized. The twister pulled trees out of the ground in a corkscrew motion, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some houses looked like they just exploded," said Capt. Robert Lee of the 
Carroll County Sheriff's Department. "It looked like a bomb hit right in the 
middle of the subdivision." 
</P>

More than 10 inches of rain had pelted Summerville, Ga., Friday, forcing dozens 
of evacuations. Flooding was also reported in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, 
North Carolina and Kentucky.

<P>
North Carolina officials sent damage assessment teams to areas in 19 counties 
hit with floods during the torrential storms, to determine if the state should 
apply for federal disaster assistance. 
</P>
<P>
All emergency shelters in the affected North Carolina counties were reported 
closed Saturday. More than 200 state residents were evacuated because of the 
floods.

Yellowstone Park in Wyoming had as much as 3 inches of snow overnight, and 
there were greater amounts of snow in the higher mountains nearby. Gusts 
reached about 50 m.p.h. near Casper Mountain.

POLICING ARMS TREATIES MAY COST BILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As prospects for new arms agreements increase, experts here warned Saturday, 
the cost and complexity of verification systems to police those treaties will 
grow rapidly and some of their techniques may be not be worth the money. 
</P>
<P>
A total verification bill approaching $1 billion a year is not out of the 
question by the end of the decade, experts estimated. This is assuming all of 
the nuclear, conventional and chemical weapon negotiations bear fruit, and that 
Congress and the Administration continue to demand the same level of intrusive, 
detailed inspections of Soviet facilities that they have in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Roger Hagengruber of the Sandia National Laboratory, one of several 
experts on verification who addressed a meeting of the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science here, forecast "incredible inertia against spending $1 
billion to verify a $40-billion system" of weapons involved in such agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The existing U.S.-Soviet treaty that eliminates intermediate-range nuclear 
(INF) missiles costs $25 million to $30 million per year to verify, according 
to Pentagon budget figures. 
</P>
<P>
The anticipated strategic arms reduction treaty (START) has at least four times 
more provisions than the INF agreement and will presumably cost at least $100 
million a year to police, verification experts estimated. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Soviet inspectors have established a so-called "perimeter and portal" 
monitoring enclosure around one INF missile plant in each country, for example. 
In the START treaty, at least 10 factories and perhaps 20 or 30 factories will 
be policed, according to Dr. Sidney N. Graybeal, chief scientist of the 
consulting firm Science Applications International. Policing an agreement 
cutting conventional forces in Europe will be complex as well as costly, with 
23 nations taking part, seven from the Warsaw Pact and 16 from NATO. A 
verification system will check on the pledged reductions in men, tanks, 
artillery, armored personnel carriers, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, 
presumably for a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
Further away, a chemical warfare treaty will cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars per year, plus an estimated 15% loss in production due to on-site 
inspections, according to Dr. David W. Dorn of the Livermore National 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Some inspection equipment used by U.S. monitors to police the INF treaty seem 
unduly sophisticated and costly, the experts said, and some techniques planned 
for use in the START treaty may not be cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a huge X-ray machine costing over $6 million is being installed by 
U.S. on-site inspectors to monitor the size of Soviet missiles emerging from a 
plant at Votkinsk. To do the same thing at a Utah plant they monitor, the 
Soviets use a long pole with graduated length markings and a flashlight, 
Hagengruber said. 
</P>
<P>
Both work, he said. The X-ray unit can measure key dimensions far more 
accurately and check for other deviations that may show cheating, he said, but 
seems superfluous in the present climate of U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
For the future, Graybeal suggested that the United States propose "short notice 
inspections" by human inspectors at weapons factories rather than establish 
permanent perimeter and portal monitoring networks with X-ray scanners around 
them.

FRIEDER BASKING IN GLOW OF SUN DEVILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TEMPE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a year after he abandoned the basketball team that was about to win the 
NCAA tournament and headed southwest, Bill Frieder was asked if he had any 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't sorry he left Michigan at the exact moment the Wolverines, the only 
college team he had ever coached, started their intoxicating run through the 
tournament. He doesn't feel guilty about the way it happened. He doesn't hate 
then-athletic director Bo Schembechler for making him leave when he wanted to 
finish the year. He doesn't miss the Big Ten, or the fans who booed him or the 
media who he says tormented him. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there is nothing about his home state, his school or the program he 
built that Frieder would want back. 
</P>
<P>
Not now, after he's seen the palms and the sun and the desert at Arizona State 
University. Not after he's looked into the stands to see the adoring fans give 
him a standing ovation for a nine-point loss. Not after he's proven he can make 
a mediocre team almost good in his first year. Not after he's seen what it's 
like to recruit in his place in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't happy," Frieder said in his office last week. "And that's why I left. 
I left because of my unhappiness. I busted my tail for that area, all my life. 
I won state championships in high school. They had one of the most productive 
times in Michigan basketball when I was an assistant there. It was the best era 
when I was a head coach. We won the NIT, we won Big Ten titles. But that wasn't 
enough. To get more boos than the opposing coach during introductions, you get 
upset with that." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the phone call from Arizona State late last winter. It wasn't the 
first time another school called Frieder, now 47. But it was the first time he 
seriously listened. 
</P>
<P>
"You finally say, you've got to go," he said. "You've got a group out there 
that wants you, that has a great place, and that's going to pay you twice as 
much as what they're paying you here. Why would we even consider staying? So we 
left." 
</P>
<P>
That, in a nutshell, is why Frieder was sitting in a hotel room in Seattle, 
watching his team win the 1989 NCAA title on television, as one of his 
assistants, Steve Fisher, stood in his place beside the bench. And that is why 
he now is losing to teams he would have beaten with his Michigan team, 
recruiting like mad, and loving it. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils, who haven't had a winning season since 1982-83, are 12-11 this 
season, 5-9 in the Pacific-10 after losing, 71-50, Thursday night at Arizona. 
Season-ticket sales are up nearly 50 percent to 7,200. Frieder, known for a 
wonderful touch with recruits, has signed five players who are so good, 
national observers say he has one of the top 10 freshman classes next year. 
Frieder reportedly will make an extra $20,000 for the top-notch recruiting 
class because of a clause in his contract, believed to be worth about $400,000 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The team is better than I thought," he said. "We've done well. Things are 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Close your eyes as Frieder talks and he sounds like Schembechler, the athletic 
director who told him if he had another job, he should simply leave. Frieder's 
vowels are as flat as the Michigan countryside where he grew up, his cadence as 
steady as the people he grew up with. 
</P>
<P>
Open your eyes, and he almost looks like Bo. He squints a lot. A smile is rare. 
He wears a blue warmup over a yellow shirt -- Michigan colors. (The yellow is 
Arizona State gold, not maize, he says, and to prove it, he pulls back the 
jacket to reveal a Sun Devil over his heart.) A Michigan Big Ten championship 
watch is wrapped around his wrist and a Michigan Big Ten championship ring sits 
on his finger. He expects Fisher will get him an NCAA ring. His old players 
have his phone number, and they still call. 
</P>
<P>
"They lose to Purdue, they lose at Indiana, and all of a sudden, my phone's 
ringing," Frieder said. "Rumeal Robinson and Terry Mills, those kids are close 
to me and always have been. So they call and we talk." 
</P>
<P>
They don't have to worry what time it is. Frieder's always up. He sleeps a 
couple hours a night. He eats all the wrong things. "Pop, fast food, bad 
stuff," he said. He won't stop working to watch the news, see a movie or even 
see the house his wife recently bought for them and their 10-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill is a very intense guy," said the man who hired him, Arizona State 
Athletic Director Charles Harris. "He'll work like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The title of Frieder's book says all you need to know about him. "Basket Case: 
The Frenetic Life of Michigan Coach Bill Frieder." 
</P>
<P>
The last movie Frieder saw was "The Godfather.' That was 17 years ago. He had 
never heard of "The Wizard of Oz," until someone mentioned the stage show was 
being put on at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a true story," Frieder said. 
</P>
<P>
He also doesn't know the year President Kennedy was shot. He said it happened 
when he was at Michigan, "'64 or '65." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've watched the news, ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He's not proud of this, but he's not ashamed, either. He is a basketball coach, 
nothing more, nothing less. He barely played the game himself; he was a scrappy 
5-foot-10 guard at Saginaw High School who played part-time and averaged seven 
points a game. He went to college at Michigan and never played again. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Ann Arbor with an MBA in 1965, Frieder spurned business offers to coach 
high-school basketball. He joined the staff of then-Wolverine Coach Johnny Orr 
in 1973, and become head coach in 1980, after Orr left for Iowa State. Frieder, 
known for the trademark towel he wears over his shoulder, took the Wolverines 
to the NIT title in 1984, followed by five straight NCAA tournament appearances 
and two Big Ten titles in a row. 
</P>
<P>
But his talented Michigan teams never made the final eight, much less the Final 
Four. The rap was Frieder couldn't coach in the big games. He got nervous, word 
was, and then made his players nervous. So fans at Michigan, where football 
comes first, got on him. 
</P>
<P>
"That started with the Michigan press and Dick Vitale: Can he coach?" he said. 
"Out here they talk that I can flat-out coach. I can coach. You don't win Big 
Ten championships without being a good bench coach." 
</P>
<P>
"He either learned bench-coaching since April or was able to do it all along," 
said Harris. 
</P>
<P>
The people out here think they've found a savior in Frieder. It was the second 
time they tried to hire him; the first time, in 1986, Frieder said, 
then-Michigan athletic director Don Canham called him in, gave him a $25,000 
raise and told him to stay, so he did. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he fully expected to coach Michigan through the 1989 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"If I would have gone into that tournament denying that I had an interest in 
Arizona State, and when the tournament was over, gone to Arizona State, the 
media would have blitzed me. On March 14 or 15, I knew I was coming here. For a 
day, I thought it could be kept secret. It couldn't. I was not going to lie to 
my team or the media or the public. I did it the way I thought I should do it 
with full intentions of coaching my team. C.M. Newton did it at Vanderbilt; 
Terry Holland is doing it at Virginia right now. I wanted to do it that way." 
</P>
<P>
But Schembechler said he wanted a Michigan man to coach his team, so Frieder 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too bad, it really was," he said. "I belonged with that team. 
Personally I feel we would have won it if I had been there. Those kids were 
destined to win a national championship. They were a veteran club, they had 
gone to the regionals the year before and were playing real good basketball. I 
felt bad I wasn't a part of it, but if that's the worst thing that ever happens 
to me, I'll have a great life." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder acknowledges the possibility, however, that the team may have won the 
NCAAs because he left. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what affect adversity has," he said. "It can help a team." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt in his mind the publicity surrounding his decision helped his 
new team. 
</P>
<P>
"You had everybody out here following Frieder's team, everybody out here 
getting excited about Michigan, all the recruits on the West Coast knowing Bill 
Frieder. You could not buy that kind of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"When (parents and recruits) ask me questions about leaving Michigan, I'm a 
good salesman. I can make that look like Michigan's fault in a minute. I was 
being honest, here's why I wanted to move, I was fully intending to coach my 
team, but he wouldn't let me. Now, all of a sudden, I'm a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
Frieder remains the ultimate good guy in Arizona, at least for now. He knows 
that with all those recruits, the team should be much better next year and 
everyone will know it. 
</P>
<P>
"With the freshmen, we'll be up and down, but the Pac-10's not as good as the 
Big Ten, so we might win a few," Frieder said. "The following year, when 
they're sophomores, they'll be pretty good. We can be qualifying for the NCAA 
tournament the year after next." 
</P>
<P>
This is exactly how it happened at Michigan, Frieder rebuilding quickly to get 
near the top. But when the fans begin to expect great things, Frieder was 
asked, won't they become disgruntled if they don't get it? 
</P>
<P>
"If they start booing and become critical, we'll just move further west," 
Frieder said. "We'll move to San Diego, Santa Barbara or somewhere. I know what 
I'm going to do. I'm not going to take it again."

JIM MURRAY: HE HAS HELP FOLLOWING TOUGH ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All right, what do George Selkirk, Hunk Anderson, Gene Tunney, Gene Bartow, 
Phil Bengston, Babe Dahlgren, Garry Maddox, Mychal Thompson and the guy who 
shot Wild Bill Hickok have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Easy. They all replaced legends. In most cases, the public never forgave them. 
</P>
<P>
Selkirk replaced Babe Ruth; Anderson replaced Knute Rockne. Bartow took over 
for John Wooden. Tunney, of course, took Dempsey's title. Bengston was the 
Green Bay Packers' coach after Lombardi. Maddox played center field for San 
Francisco after Willie Mays left. Dahlgren took over first base from Lou 
Gehrig, and Hickok was murdered by a one-eyed scoundrel named Jack McCall. 
</P>
<P>
This leaves Mychal Thompson as the resident legend-replacer of our times and a 
member in good standing of the L.E.P.E.R. Society (Legends Primary Emergency 
Replacements). 
</P>
<P>
Mychal had the bad luck to be standing next in line when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
retired. It's not exactly the world's greatest place to be. Abdul-Jabbar, it so 
happened, had 38,387 points in his career. When he retired, they gave him 
everything but Rhode Island. He dominated the game of basketball in the way -- 
well, say, a Ruth, Rockne, Dempsey, Gehrig, Mays, Lombardi or Wild Bill Hickok 
dominated their games. 
</P>
<P>
It's not likely Mychal Thompson will get any farewell tours when he leaves the 
game. The chances are he will fall somewhat short of Kareem's 38,387 -- he's 
26,147 behind as this is written. The probability is not good he will ever 
catch up to Abdul-Jabbar's 17,440 rebounds. It takes a really special kind of 
person to replace a legend. Not everyone can handle it. It crushes some people. 
Others take the position it's hard, dirty work but somebody has to do it. Don't 
expect to find Mychal Thompson perched on a ledge above city traffic or down 
and out onSkid Row, clutching a wine bottle and moaning, "Why couldn't it have 
been Ralph Sampson I took over for?!" 
</P>
<P>
Mychal is very good at taking things in stride. There are those who think he 
has made an art form of it. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal is not one to sit and brood. Mychal rolls with the punches. Some men, 
performing in the shadow of a departed legend, would develop all manner of 
tics, begin to lose weight, spend sleepless nights, start to talk to 
themselves, become recluses. Roger Maris, when he was breaking Ruth's homer 
record, found his hair falling out overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal's hair is just fine. He sleeps like a baby. His appetite is as good as 
ever, which is pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Mychal has found a sure-fire way to escape the obloquy that 
comes with the role. He shares the billing. Mychal does not take the rap alone. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Mychal's team, the Lakers, went out over the off-season and signed the 
best center in Serbia to share the pivot with Mychal. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the nice thing about Vlade Divac is that, while he knows very well who 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is, he doesn't have a firm enough grasp on English to know 
when someone is yelling at him, "Call yourself a center, Divac?! Jabbar would 
have sky-hooked that thing and drawn a foul." Vlade is perfect as a legend 
replacement. Vlade's hair is not going to fall out, either. 
</P>
<P>
Which suits Mychal. When someone asks him, as a reporter did in the Laker 
dressing room the other night, whether he thinks his progress as a legend 
replacement is going smoothly, he answers sweetly, "I feel we're doing a good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
We?! 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are lots of We's in the world. Lindbergh always cut his airplane in 
on the glory, and "We" was the title of his autobiography. Queen Victoria 
always referred to herself in the plural: "We are not amused." Fight managers 
always say, "We knocked out the champ." But of course, when things go wrong, 
Tonto says to the Lone Ranger, "Where do you get that we stuff, Kemo Sabe!?" 
</P>
<P>
So, Mychal lets Vlade get cards in this deal. Basketball is a team game, right? 
Mychal is a guy who can delegate. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal is a guy who has his own outlook on life, anyway. Mychal goes through 
life as if he's riding an elephant. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, most people who live in the snow belt or rust belt work all their 
lives so they can move to the Bahamas or anywhere the beaches are white and 
coconuts grow in the backyard. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal was born there -- in Nassau -- and he chose to move to Minnesota as soon 
as he graduated from high school -- in Miami, would you believe? 
</P>
<P>
Mychal passed up Florida State and other orange blossom schools and went north 
to Minneapolis. The fact he was bucking a trend apparently eluded him, even 
though his friends wondered, "What did you have against Hudson Bay?" 
</P>
<P>
Usually, when a green rookie opts for a region of the country where he needs a 
ski cap to go down for the mail, the next scene sees him pulling every string 
he can think of to get back to the sun and sand. Not Mychal. He loved 
Minnesota. Mychal was so happy, he made All-American twice, set school records 
in scoring, rebounding and scoring average -- and this on a team that had Kevin 
McHale on it. "I loved it up there, it had a great purity about it," he 
insists. 
</P>
<P>
When Mychal got drafted in the pros by Portland, he was delighted. Mychal likes 
carrying an umbrella. He still keeps a house in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
So, Mychal is not deterred by the role into which history has cast him. 
Particularly since he comes as part of an entry, Mychal Thompson and Vlade 
Divac, Nos. 1 and 1A. 
</P>
<P>
"We match up pretty well," Mychal insists. To date, Thompson-Divac have almost 
evenly split 894 points and 606 rebounds. Which compares to the 748 points 
Abdul-Jabbar had his last season or even the 1,165 he had in his next-to-last 
season, and to the rebound total Abdul-Jabbar had of 523 1in his next-to-last 
season or 334 his last season. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Kareem is being double-teamed. So, Mychal makes no apology. It 
strikes him as the proper way to tackle a legend on or off the court -- get 
help. 
</P>
<P>
He is even hoping to make Divac a better player. "He doesn't need any help on 
his offense, but I can teach him a few things on defense," Mychal says. 
</P>
<P>
So, what does Mychal Thompson have in common with George Selkirk, Hunk Anderson 
and the other legend-replacers of our times? Absolutely nothing. Mychal knows 
better than to go it alone. Mychal knows something those other replacers 
didn't: You can't go man-to-man with a legend. You have to zone him.

What nature gave away the first two rounds, she took back with a fury Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After two days of sunny, cool and relatively calm conditions, the winds kicked 
up and so did the scores Saturday in the third round of the $900,000 Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
While it took a total of two-under par to make the 36-hole cut Friday, only 
eight of 87 players broke par 72 on the South Course on a day of cloudy skies, 
drizzle and gusty winds. 
</P>
<P>
Ten more managed par and one, Dan Forsman, was able to hold his game together 
and take a two-shot lead after three rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Forsman's 72 gave him a three-round total of 13-under 203, two strokes ahead of 
Tommy Armour III, who needed birdies on two of the final four holes to salvage 
a 73. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased to get around in par," said Forsman, who finished 99th on 
the 1989 money list. "I'm not the best wind player. I went into the day a 
little bit uneasy. I woke up a couple times in my hotel room and heard the wind 
blowing outside. I didn't sleep well after that. 
</P>
<P>
"This round wasn't fun; it was a survival test." 
</P>
<P>
Few of the changes in fortune were more dramatic than that of Bob Eastwood, who 
led Forsman by a stroke at the tournament's halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood, who set a Torrey Pines' 36-hole record of 130, shot a 40 on the front 
nine and finished with a four-over 76, leaving him alone in third place, three 
strokes behind Forsman at 206. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very difficult to do anything out there," Eastwood said. "You just 
tried to hold your balance and make a good solid golf shot. And I didn't hit 
too many good golf shots." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone cursed the shift in weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara, whose four victories at Pebble Beach Golf Links attest to his 
seaside course abilities, shot a low-round 67. 
</P>
<P>
That moved him into a tie for fourth at 207 with Craig Stadler, who had one of 
four 70s in the round. O'Meara, who started Saturday in a tie for 32nd, 10 
strokes behind leader Eastwood, opens today four behind Forsman. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it, and I'm not saying that because I hit 67," said O'Meara, a 
resident of nearby Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my caddy going down the first hole that these are absolutely perfect 
conditions. I was so far behind the leader to start the day the only chance I 
had was to shoot a 66-65, regardless of what the weather was like. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as (I saw) the weather, I knew if I shot two or three under that would 
put me in position to where if I shoot a good score (today) I have a chance to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
The conditions on the front nine were especially tricky. With most of the holes 
sitting atop exposed ocean cliff, the players battled gusts of up to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters was the uncharacteristic southerly direction of the 
breeze. Usually the wind at Torrey Pines blows west off the ocean; the shift 
meant the players often found themselves in the unsettling position of playing 
with the wind at their backs on one hole and having to turn and face into it 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
It made for a day of 370-yard drives going with the wind that left a sand wedge 
approach on the 499-yard, par-five 18th for Forsman, contrasting to a 
three-iron into the wind on the 404-yard fifth by O'Meara that went only 140 
yards. Strangely, both made birdie as Forsman routinely two-putted, and O'Meara 
holed an 80-foot pitch shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good break because I was just short of the bunker," O'Meara said. "I 
chipped it, but I had too much speed. It hit the pin in the middle and went in; 
that set the tone for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very demanding out there, very trying. You have to have a lot of 
patience. You have to realize that par is a good score." 
</P>
<P>
The same could be true today as conditions for the final round might be worse. 
A steady rain began after the conclusion of play and further rain is predicted 
today, along with wind and cool temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Such a forecast might normally worry Forsman, but his round Saturday might calm 
his nerves. 
</P>
<P>
"This round goes a long way to showing me I can play in the wind," Forsman 
said. "That is something I needed." 
</P>
<P>
And something he might need again.

RACE WAS EASY COMPARED TO WINNING FANS; 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR: WALTRIP ENJOYED NEW-FOUND POPULARITY LAST YEAR. NOW HE CAN RELAX AND GO 
FOR TWO IN A ROW TODAY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Darrell Waltrip looks at it, he expects to successfully defend his 
Daytona 500 title in today's $2-million stock car race, but even if he doesn't, 
he figures he can't lose. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a better time down here than ever before," he said. "I used to come 
to Daytona and get bugged all the time about why I never won the Daytona 500. 
And when I went out on the track I'd hear nothing but boos. 
</P>
<P>
"All that's behind me now. I don't get those terrible questions about winning 
and I hear cheers instead of boos. How can I lose in an atmosphere change like 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip also considers himself fortunate not to have been caught up in the 
last-lap accident during the first Twin 125 Thursday at Daytona International 
Speedway that knocked Hendrick Motorsports teammate Ken Schrader off the pole 
and back to the rear of the field. 
</P>
<P>
When Schrader's Chevrolet Lumina got loose and starting spinning off the third 
turn, Waltrip was sandwiched between Schrader and the Pontiac of Hut Stricklin, 
but he managed to squeeze through with inches -- maybe only a half-inch -- to 
spare before Stricklin smacked into the side of Schrader's car. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never turned a steering wheel that much in my life," Waltrip said. "That 
was sooo close, I couldn't believe I actually got through. Maybe it's an omen." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip believes in omens. 
</P>
<P>
Last year when he finally won his first Daytona 500 after winning three Winston 
Cup championships, he was driving No. 17, was in his 17th Daytona 500, and his 
daughter, Jessica, was 17 months old after being born on the 17th of September. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the Daytona 500 is like winning the Super Bowl in football," Waltrip 
said. "When I came around Turn Nine at Riverside in 1981 and the crew hung up 
that sign, 'Hello Champion,' I thought it was the greatest thing that could 
ever happen to me on a race track, but winning the Daytona 500 is right there. 
</P>
<P>
"It not only got the monkey off my back about why I couldn't win it, it also 
seemed to change the public's attitude toward me. It hadn't been easy on me or 
Stevie (his wife) hearing those boos race after race. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when Stevie dreaded driver introductions. She would walk out 
with me to make me feel better, but it hurt both of us. 
</P>
<P>
"I think winning here, after there had been a lot of talk about me being over 
the hill, that started the ball rolling the other way. I know a lot has been 
said about that deal at Charlotte where Rusty (Wallace) knocked me out of 
$200,000 on national TV in the Winston, but I was already hearing some cheers 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
"Fans saw how excited I was about winning here, jumping up and down and doing 
my little dance, and Stevie and Jessica being with me in the winner's circle, 
and fans started saying, 'Hey, maybe Darrell Waltrip's a good guy after all.' " 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip went on to win six races and challenge for the Winston Million after 
winning at both Daytona and Charlotte, N.C. He fell short of the $1 million at 
Darlington, S.C., but he still says that "having a big year in 1989 probably 
meant more to me than any other year." 
</P>
<P>
At year's end, he was given NASCAR's most-popular-driver award at a banquet in 
New York. It was the first time he had even been a contender for the honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea I would ever win that award," Waltrip said. "I think a lot of 
fans were voting for Stevie and Jessica as much as for me, but winning it rates 
right up there with my Winston Cup championships and the Daytona 500." 
</P>
<P>
Now, as befitting a popular defending champion, Waltrip must turn his attention 
to today's 500-mile race, opening event of NASCAR's premier racing series. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely one of the cars to beat," he said. "I'd like to win six or 
eight races this season, starting right there, and when we don't win, I want to 
be the car to beat. The Lumina is proving to be a good change after the Monte 
Carlo." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip drove a Monte Carlo in last year's victory, but Chevrolet switched to 
Lumina in the middle of the '89 season, and Waltrip won the Coca-Cola 600 at 
Charlotte in the car's second outing. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can go through this season without some of those DNF's 
(did-not-finishes) that hurt last year, I don't see why we can't win the 
championship. I'd like to win my fourth one in my 40s." 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip turned 43 on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader's crash has changed the complexion of the race. Instead of his Chevy 
sitting on the pole, it will be Geoff Bodine driving Junior Johnson's Ford out 
in front. When Schrader dropped to the rear in his backup car, it meant that 
everyone behind him moved up a slot, and Bodine was next after winning one of 
Thursday's qualifying races. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Earnhardt, who won the other Twin 125, will start alongside Bodine on the 
front row. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip, who finished fourth in Bodine's heat, will start from the fourth row. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have liked to qualify better and be on the front row, but starting where 
we are isn't going to hurt. We did some testing in the wind tunnel during the 
off-season and we're confident we can be as fast as anybody on the track, 
although the new restrictor plates tend to equalize everybody out." 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR officials, who installed a one-inch carburetor restrictor plate in 1988 
for races at Daytona and Talladega, Ala., to help reduce speeds that were 
approaching 215 m.p.h., made further restrictions this year by cutting the 
opening to 15/16ths of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule will cost the cars about 40 horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
The race shapes up as a classic confrontation between Chevrolet and Ford, with 
Pontiac hoping to spoil the party -- especially the Pontiac of Richard Petty, 
which made King Richard look 20 years younger than his 52 when he led 
impressively in one of the Twin 125s. 
</P>
<P>
Bodine, Bill Elliott and Mark Martin, all of whom displayed a winning potential 
in Thursday's races, will drive Fords. 
</P>
<P>
"We won the qualifier by conserving on fuel," Bodine said. "Sunday, you'll see 
us using more horsepower and running harder, but the lessons we learned saving 
fuel could help like it did Waltrip last year." 
</P>
<P>
Schrader appeared to have the 1989 race well in hand until Waltrip skipped a 
late pit stop to cruise home on fumes and win the race. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who hopes to wipe out the memory of some misfortune here last year 
with a strong ride, may be the sleeper in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is better than last year," Elliott said. "It had to be. Last year, 
I got a ticket for turning out of McDonalds the wrong way, then drew 13th in 
the (Busch) Clash, and the next day broke my arm. One improvement this year is 
that I'll drive with two arms instead of one." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Schrader, the pole-sitter, is starting in the back row, the Chevrolet 
leadership falls to Earnhardt and Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
Earnhardt, the hard-charging three-time Winston Cup champion, finds himself in 
much the same situation as Waltrip did last year. He has won 39 major races but 
has driven in 11 Daytona 500s without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always run real good here, I just haven't managed to win," Earnhardt 
said. "Every time the car has been right, we've been in the fight, and the car 
feels right this year. 
</P>
<P>
"With hardly any rain, and so much rubber being laid down by all these other 
classes, the track is going to be really slick, and I think that will be in my 
favor. Not many guys like slick tracks. I've always been more comfortable on 
them than most anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's hot Sunday. If it is, a lot of guys will make a lot of changes to 
get their car feeling right, and they're liable to get all screwed up. I don't 
plan on adjusting anything. I'm just going to hold the throttle wide open, 
clean the windshield, get a drink of water and say, 'Let's go.' I just want gas 
and tires. I don't want to turn any bolts." 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the Pontiac driven by Wallace, the defending series champion, 
does not appear to be a factor. Wallace, who finished 15th in both of the last 
two races last year, will start in the 38th qualifying position alongside Jimmy 
Means after running poorly in his qualifying heat. 
</P>
<P>
In the early running, Schrader will be the car to watch as he attempts to pick 
his way through the field from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough to give up the point, but we'll just have to make the best of 
it," Schrader said. "The backup car was pretty equal, and with 500 miles we 
have plenty of time to work our way back. 
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that NASCAR ruled that we're still eligible for the 
Unocal bonus." 
</P>
<P>
The Unocal 76 Challenge bonus, which started out with $7,600 offered to the 
first driver to win from the pole, has now reached $212,800. There have been 28 
races without a winner from the pole.

MIKE DOWNEY: KINGS A REAL PAIN IN EAR FOR WEBSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your hockey players play Winnipeg. Lose. Fly to Pittsburgh. Get two goals 
ahead. Lose. Travel on to Toronto. Lose. Go to Detroit. Get three goals ahead. 
Lose. Go to Minnesota. Give up a goal 13 seconds into the game. Lose. 
</P>
<P>
Lose some nights with big leads. Lose some nights without even putting up 
fights. Lose every which way, but lose. 
</P>
<P>
Lose without you, so you can't even be there to chew anybody out. 
</P>
<P>
It's enough to make the red bulb inside your head glow red. 
</P>
<P>
For Tom Webster, the one thing more depressing than coaching the Kings over the 
last couple of weeks has been not coaching them. 
</P>
<P>
You're in NHL limbo. You watch TV. You make mental notes, things you want to 
remind the players or the interim coaches of, next time you speak with them. 
This is your team, but somebody else is running it. 
</P>
<P>
All you can do is watch your team lose. You resist the urge to cross-check the 
television set into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm more analytical than anything," Webster said. "I try not to lose 
control of my emotions." 
</P>
<P>
For your health's sake? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, mostly that," Webster said. "As well as the furniture's." 
</P>
<P>
Webster is on leave of absence because of an inner-ear malfunction, the same 
kind that interrupted his first season coaching the New York Rangers in 1986. 
He slipped and fell in a shower on Jan. 26 in Edmonton and aggravated the old 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Rest was prescribed, but that didn't clear up the condition. Webster is 
scheduled to have surgery Tuesday, and he's expected to miss another three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Webster went to their practice rink in Culver City first thing Friday to wait 
for the Kings to return from their trip that took them five games below .500 
and left them closer to last place in the Smythe Division than to first place. 
</P>
<P>
All you can do is watch and wait. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to unlock the doors, turn on the lights," Webster said, finding 
himself at a nearly deserted rink, all dressed up and no one to coach. 
</P>
<P>
With the team's plane late getting back to LAX, Webster waited around, trying 
to keep busy, watching wing Scott Bjugstad work out, keeping an eye on injured 
Tony Granato, the new kid in town, the kid the Kings acquired in the Bernie 
Nicholls trade with the Rangers. The Kings are waiting for Granato the same way 
they are waiting for Webster. Granato has been in only one game. 
</P>
<P>
Cap Raeder and Rick Wilson are co-coaching the team. Wayne Gretzky is 
ankle-deep in a slump. Kelly Hrudey has mononucleosis. The Kings are slightly 
unglued. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part," Webster said, "is that we're so darn close. It's all the 
little mistakes that keep killing us, little things that have turned into one 
big headache. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the games on this trip. We had a genuine chance to win just about 
all of them. And, somehow or other, we end up losing." 
</P>
<P>
What can you do about it? 
</P>
<P>
"What can you do? About all you can do is skate your way out of it." 
</P>
<P>
It would help to have healthy and sound bodies. It also would help if the Kings 
could ever find a couple of line partners for Gretzky and leave them there for 
more than a month or two. Tomas Sandstrom, the main acquisition in the Nicholls 
deal, is trying to make the adjustment, make his presence felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with Sandstrom, with what he's contributed so far," Webster 
said. "It's going to take time to adjust to Wayne, to being on his wing, but 
that'll work out. I'm not worried about Sandstrom. He'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
No, what he's worried about is how some of the other Kings are playing, and how 
recent developments might be affecting them, body and soul. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for all good Kings to come to the aid of the party. To do what 
Todd Elik has done. Elik, who came to the Kings from the Rangers late in 1988, 
has been one of the few players of late to show that he's here and he intends 
to stay. The kid plays as if he means business. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other Kings need to look in mirrors and see if there's any 
reflection. They are disappearing; there is no nicer way to put it. Only two of 
the Campbell Conference's 10 teams -- Detroit and Vancouver -- have worse 
records than Los Angeles. Shameful. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, the Kings are embarrassing themselves, squandering the greatness 
of Gretzky and risking the alienation of all those fans who had gotten to know 
not only them, but their sport. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, when things are going bad, you can comfort someone by saying: 
"Well, at least you've still got your health." 
</P>
<P>
To Tom Webster, you can't even say that. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings need him back, need him badly. Somebody has to turn on their lights.

MINER PROBLEMS SLOW TROJANS, 74-70; 
</P>
<P>
USC: FRESHMAN HAS AN OFF DAY AS CAL SWEEPS THROUGH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND 
TAKES SOLE POSSESSION OF THIRD PLACE IN THE PAC-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Harold Miner, USC's extraordinary freshman guard, had an ordinary game in the 
Trojans' 74-70 loss to Cal Saturday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The top freshman scorer in the Pacific 10 Conference with a 20.2 average, Miner 
went 0 for the first half, missing five jumpers, including two three-point 
shots. It was Miner's worst half since he scored one point in the second half 
against Portland two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although it has become standard for USC's opponents to use a gimmick defense to 
stop Miner, Cal didn't assign anyone to chase Miner around the court. Miner was 
no match for Cal's two-three matchup zone because he was unable to penetrate. 
Stricken by the flu, Miner appeared listless in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Patient that his shots would fall, Miner finally started hitting and wound up 
with 15 points. He hit six of 10 shots in the second half, including two 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Miner refused to use the flu as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play nearly as well as I could play, so the flu didn't have anything 
to do with it," Miner said. "I got a couple open shots (in the second half), 
but I didn't make the ones that counted, so it really doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Did USC Coach George Raveling think Miner missed nine of 15 shots because he 
had the flu? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to get into that (making excuses)," Raveling said. "There's a 
little too much of that going around this town. One thing I've learned at SC is 
how to be a good loser." 
</P>
<P>
Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said: "I thought we did a pretty good job on Miner. 
Six-for-15 shooting is as good as you're going to do against Harold Miner. He's 
a great offensive player." 
</P>
<P>
Keith Smith, Cal's senior guard, is a fine offensive player, too. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 22 points in the Golden Bears' 79-71 victory over UCLA Thursday 
night, Smith scored a career-high 27 points against the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole game came down to Keith Smith," Raveling said. "We were not able to 
stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Smith hit 10 of 14 shots, including a three-pointer, and made six of seven free 
throws as Cal (19-6, 10-4) won its fifth game in a row and took sole possession 
of third place in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith really played an outstanding game," Raveling said. "I think one of the 
hallmarks of a great player is that he finds a way to win for his team. Smith 
took all the big shots for them. And they weren't easy shots. Most of them he 
was under pressure and he made them. My hat's off to him." 
</P>
<P>
With Cal leading 60-58, Smith made a jumper from just inside the three-point 
line. After Ronnie Coleman cut the deficit to two with a dunk, Smith hit a 
three-point shot to give Cal a five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I got into the flow and they started running plays for me," Smith said. "The 
shots were there. I got hot, so I kept taking them." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Ryan Drew also made some pressure shots down the stretch, scoring seven 
of his 15 points in the final six minutes. He hit two three-point shots and 
sank a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
After USC center Chris Munk dunked a missed free throw by Miner to cut the 
deficit to 70-68 with 2:51 remaining, Drew hit a three-point 25-footer with 
2:13 remaining to give Cal a five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned square and shot the ball," said Drew, "but I really didn't know how 
far back I was until the ball left my hand. It's one of those shots where if I 
made it, everything's fine, but when you miss them, you know Coach Campanelli 
is going to be upset." 
</P>
<P>
USC (9-12, 4-10) didn't quit after Drew's shot. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who scored a team-high 18 points, made a layin to cut it to three 
points with 1:48 left. After Smith missed a jumper on Cal's next possession, 
Coleman grabbed the rebound and was fouled as he went up for a follow shot with 
54 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But Coleman missed both free throws, and Cal guard Bill Elleby sealed the game 
by making a free throw with 33 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Although Miner was scoreless in the first half, the Trojans led, 39-35, at 
intermission as guard Robert Pack scored 11 points and Coleman added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Cal was forced to play the last 10:24 of the first half without center Brian 
Hendrick, who went to the bench after drawing his third foul. Hendrick's 
absence hurt the Golden Bears because Eric McDonough, his replacement, was 
ineffective. Leading 19-17 when Hendrick left the game, the Golden Bears were 
outscored, 13-6, in the next six minutes as USC took a 32-29 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who had 14 first-half points, brought the Bears back, scoring four 
points in a 6-0 run as Cal took a 35-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Trojans scored seven consecutive points in the final 1:56 of the first 
half to regain the lead. Pack hit a three-point shot from the right side to tie 
the score and Keith Greeley sank two free throws. Rodney Chatman followed a 
Pack miss with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Center Chris Munk had 12 points and 12 rebounds. It was the fifth time this 
season that Munk has had double figures in points and rebounds in a game. . . . 
USC plays Maryland Monday night at 7:30 at the Sports Arena. The Trojans are 
playing a nonconference game against the Terrapins in the midst of the Pac-10 
season because of Coach George Raveling's friendship with Bob Wade, the former 
Maryland coach.

SAN DIEGO BEATS ST. MARY'S, KEEPS HOPES ALIVE

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The University of San Diego seems to have a different star every game, and 
Saturday night it was Anthony Thomas and Randy Thompson drawing praise from 
Coach Hank Egan after a 93-61 rout of St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the Toreros, 14-10 overall and 9-3 in the West Coast 
Conference, alive in the WCC race. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the two guys that deserve special recognition were Anthony Thomas 
and Randy Thompson," Egan said. "I thought Randy Thompson made some key plays, 
did a good job defensively, got some big boards and really moved the ball and 
hit the open man against their press. 
</P>
<P>
"And Anthony Thomas -- he's been trying real hard to fit in. He came off the 
bench and was just with it tonight. He was tremendous off the boards." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone chipped in for San Diego. Even little-used Shawn Hamilton, and 
freshmen Joe Temple and Brooks Barnhard. 
</P>
<P>
They were allowed court time because Thomas had a career-high 16 points and 
seven rebounds in only 17 minutes, because Thompson was superb on defense and 
added five assists in 12 minutes, because Wayman Strickland had 15 points and 
11 assists, because Kelvin Woods had 12 points and seven rebounds, and because 
Pat Holbert had 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome wasn't bad, either. The 6-foot-8 senior forward had 18 points and 11 
rebounds. It was the sixth consecutive game he has reached double figures in 
both categories. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive game that San Diego has had five scorers in 
double figures. The Toreros turned a similar trick Thursday in a 96-84 victory 
over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
This was San Diego's seventh victory in a row and 11th in the 14 games since 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros still have games remaining at Loyola Marymount and third-place 
Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest margin of victory for either team in the series.

Digger Phelps didn't go for the tie because Notre Dame needs victories. 
</P>
<P>
Elmer Bennett made a three-pointer as the buzzer sounded and the Irish, making 
their annual run for the NCAA tournament, beat fourth-ranked Syracuse, 66-65, 
Saturday at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted the three," Phelps said. "We were going all out and Elmer makes a 
great shot on a great pass from (LaPhonso) Ellis." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (14-8) won its first of six road games against ranked teams, ending 
Syracuse's 37-game nonconference home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse's last nonconference home loss was to Navy and David Robinson in the 
second round of the NCAA tournament in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 32,747 fans, short of the 32,820 who watched 
Syracuse defeat Connecticut this season. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Owens' basket gave Syracuse (18-5) a 65-63 lead with four seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish called a timeout with two seconds remaining, but officials added a 
second on the clock. That gave Notre Dame enough time for Ellis to get the 
inbounds pass upcourt and into the hands of Bennett, who penetrated to the top 
of the key and launched an uncontested shot that sent Syracuse to its second 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was going to be long," Bennett said. "It seemed like it 
stayed in the air for 20 minutes. Then it went in and it was pandemonium." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse overcame a 13-point deficit in the final 12 minutes and took a 63-62 
lead on Stephen Thompson's layup with 1:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis made one of two free throws to make the score 63-63 with 43 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett scored 18 points, Keith Robinson had 13, Joe Frederick and Monty 
Williams added 12 apiece, and Ellis had 11 points and 15 rebounds for the 
Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Coleman scored 16 points for Syracuse, and Thompson and Owens each had 
14.

TARKANIAN, NCAA INVESTIGATORS NOW INTO ROUND 2; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BUT THIS TIME, NEVADA LAS VEGAS COACH IS EXPECTED TO 
RESOLVE MATTERS WITHOUT GOING TO COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of sports' most compelling legal battles has, after 13 years, nearly run 
its course. The case of Nevada Las Vegas basketball Coach Jerry Tarkanian vs. 
the NCAA is only a couple of conference calls away from a resolution that 
probably will bring sanctions against the UNLV program rather than the 
suspension of its coach, the issue that got the whole thing started in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
But as one battle ends for Tarkanian, another looms. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the last 2 1/2 years, NCAA investigators have crisscrossed the 
country contacting former UNLV players and recruits and combed through UNLV 
athletic department files as part of a preliminary inquiry -- the initial, 
fact-finding stage of an NCAA investigation -- into the UNLV basketball 
program. The last time the NCAA took such a look at the Rebels, Tarkanian wound 
up taking the NCAA to court, and the atmosphere surrounding the current 
investigation is much as it was 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV officials, Tarkanian included, say they are committed to cooperating with 
the NCAA. Nonetheless, there are signs that this isn't your everyday 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The central figure in the case, former UNLV recruit Lloyd Daniels, has charged 
that an NCAA investigator attempted to bribe him for information damaging to 
UNLV. A junior college coach has written NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz 
to pass on a student manager's complaint that an NCAA investigator represented 
himself as a reporter in attempting to talk with a former UNLV player. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA officials generally hold their tongues. They are not supposed to comment 
publicly on active cases -- company policy. Privately, however, they speak of a 
frustrating case. One person familiar with the investigation speaks of sources 
"killing you with kindness and then disappearing." Says another: "The threat is 
out." 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the matter is Daniels, a 6-foot-8 swingman from New York whose 
ability on the court has been matched only by his uncanny ability to find 
trouble off it. 
</P>
<P>
When Daniels signed with UNLV in April of 1986, he read at a third-grade level 
and had just dropped out of Andrew Jackson High in Queens, the fourth high 
school he had attended. But after attending Mt. San Antonio College in the fall 
of '86, he enrolled at UNLV as a full-time student, and he was on track to play 
for the Rebels as a junior college transfer until he was arrested on drug 
charges in Las Vegas in February of 1987. The arrest prompted Tarkanian to 
announce immediately that Daniels would never play at UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Daniels would be gone, but not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, a series of stories in Newsday outlined ways in which UNLV 
coaches, boosters and other representatives of the school apparently broke NCAA 
rules in their dealings with Daniels. The series showed how Daniels received a 
variety of special privileges -- including cash, a car and a motorcycle -- 
while attempting to become eligible to play for the Rebels. Many of the 
allegations focused on Mark Warkentien, UNLV's basketball recruiting 
coordinator at the time, who had become Daniels' legal guardian. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV President Robert Maxson appointed a committee to conduct an in-house 
investigation, but after reviewing the matter for nearly seven months, the 
committee informed Maxson that it couldn't reach any conclusions. The committee 
recommended to Maxson that he turn the matter over to the Pacific Coast 
Athletic Assn. (now known as the Big West) and the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"On the Daniels situation, I definitely feel everything is going to be OK," 
Tarkanian said recently. "But what it did, it opened the door for them (the 
NCAA) to come in. They got all of our records. Our university has gone out and 
gotten all of our recruiting bills, everything. And when you go through all 
that stuff, there are going to be a few errors. Nothing major. We didn't do 
anything major. But they'll come up with something. 
</P>
<P>
"You turn over all your telephone records, all your records of everything 
you've ever done, to anybody, they'll find something somewhere. They're going 
to find a recruiting visit where maybe a kid ate more than he should have eaten 
or something. We didn't do anything major. But once you invite those guys (the 
NCAA) in, it's like inviting the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . They're looking at every recruit since 1986. Every record since 1986. 
We're going to be OK with recruits, too. . . . But I'm scared. Because of me, 
if something's minor, by the time they (the NCAA) get done and the way they 
release it to the paper. . . . You know, they control the media. Like if a kid 
charged $24 instead of $20 (the maximum amount a school is allowed to spend per 
day to entertain a prospect during a recruiting visit), they'll bring it out 
like he got extra money or something, and then that's how the papers get it." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA began chasing Tarkanian when he was building his powerhouse teams at 
Cal State Long Beach in the late 1960s and early '70s. By the time Long Beach 
was placed on probation in 1974, Tarkanian was coaching at UNLV, but the NCAA 
would catch up with him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the NCAA placed UNLV on probation with sanctions that included no 
appearances in postseason competition or on television for two years. The NCAA 
also ordered the university to "show cause" why it shouldn't suspend Tarkanian 
for two years or be penalized further. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38 violations documented by the NCAA, 10 involved Tarkanian directly. 
The most serious dealt with Tarkanian's role in trying to encourage a key 
source for the NCAA, a former UNLV player named Jeep Kelley, to lie to 
investigators about his dealings with UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that the NCAA had used questionable tactics and that he had 
successfully refuted the charges against him, Tarkanian obtained court 
injunctions in Las Vegas against both the university and the NCAA that allowed 
him to continue coaching. The case -- hinging on the question of whether the 
NCAA should be considered a governmental body whose actions must meet 
constitutional due process requirements -- went all the way to the U.S. Supreme 
Court, which ruled, 5-4, in the NCAA's favor in December of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision, Schultz said he believed that the 
NCAA Committee on Infractions probably would take some sort of action against 
the university instead of pushing for the suspension of Tarkanian as it did 13 
years ago. When the Nevada Supreme Court, in a ruling last spring, ordered the 
lower court to lift Tarkanian's injunction against the NCAA, the case inched 
closer to such a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
But as the details that would settle the case are worked out, NCAA 
investigators look for fresh tracks. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV's recruitment of Daniels might, in large measure, come down to how the 
NCAA wants to interpret it. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Athletic Director Brad Rothermel has said he was informed through PCAA 
officials in August of 1986 that the NCAA would allow a university staff member 
to become the guardian for a potential student-athlete. Based on that 
discussion, in which no names were mentioned, Warkentien filed his petition to 
become Daniels' legal guardian, Rothermel said. The petition received court 
approval that October. 
</P>
<P>
Remarks about Daniels and UNLV by ESPN commentator Dick Vitale during a 
broadcast of a game between the University of Arizona and the Soviet national 
team a few weeks later raised such a stir, however, that Lew Cryer, then 
commissioner of the PCAA, urged Rothermel to contact the NCAA in writing and 
specifically mention Warkentien and Daniels. Rothermel did so and received a 
reply stating that, no matter how the court saw Warkentien's relationship with 
Daniels, the relationship would not be exempt from NCAA recruiting rules. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, Warkentien had already purchased an $1,800 motorcycle for Daniels 
to use while attending Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the NCAA) have said we should have specifically identified the 
student-athlete involved," Rothermel said recently. "And we didn't. It would 
seem like it shouldn't make any difference if your general question and your 
specific question are basically the same, but it may. That's yet to be 
determined." 
</P>
<P>
While UNLV officials concede that the scope of the NCAA's inquiry has gone far 
beyond UNLV's recruitment of Daniels, they say they believe the inquiry is 
finding only minor infractions. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rothermel, those infractions include "less than $500" in 
long-distance phone calls charged to the university by "a half dozen" UNLV 
players and cap-and-gown rental fees paid by Tarkanian's wife, Lois, for five 
players who graduated in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's scrutiny of the school's records recently found that nine players 
had failed to pay incidental charges at hotels where the team stayed on the 
road last year. The NCAA determined that the unpaid expenses violated its rules 
and ordered one-game suspensions for each of the players involved. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has also been studying UNLV's academic tutoring program for athletes, 
looking specifically at whether Daniels and other players received tutoring 
provided by the school before they enrolled. Under NCAA rules, a school may not 
pay educational expenses for an athlete before the athlete's enrollment. "But I 
don't think there are any major violations in that area," Rothermel said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has, nevertheless, been dealing with allegations unrelated to Daniels 
that could lead to major violations. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those allegations involve Ricky Collier, a former UNLV player from 
Riverside who befriended Daniels in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Collier was quoted in the Newsday series as saying that, during his career at 
UNLV, he obtained cars at no charge from a Las Vegas auto rental agency owned 
by a UNLV booster, Norm Jenkins, and received free airline tickets for a 
girlfriend from a travel agency Jenkins owned at one time. Jenkins denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with columnist John Henderson of the Las Vegas Review-Journal 
last May, Collier said he had been harassed and threatened because of his 
connection to the Daniels matter. "People say, 'You could end up in the 
desert,' " Collier said. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview with Henderson, Collier said he told the NCAA he lied to 
Newsday. Collier said in the interview that he had been upset with Tarkanian 
for not playing him more, but that he and Tarkanian had reached "an 
understanding." Collier told Henderson: "I messed up, I'm very sorry, and it'll 
never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Collier, who could not be reached by The Times, currently is playing for a 
professional team in the Netherlands -- an arrangement set up last September by 
Warkentien, according to Ray Paglia, Collier's former roommate in Las Vegas. 
Warkentien is now an assistant to Rothermel. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources familiar with the NCAA inquiry, who asked not to be 
identified, Collier has, in fact, stood by the story he gave Newsday in 
interviews with the NCAA and has further alleged that he received a large cash 
payment from a booster while attending UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Problems have arisen in finding corroboration for Collier's information, 
however, the sources said. "Even people he said would help don't help," one 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has also been frustrated in its attempts to talk to Daniels, who has 
played in the Continental Basketball Assn. and New Zealand and survived a 
drug-related shooting since leaving UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn statement, Daniels claimed he was contacted by an unidentified NCAA 
investigator last May when he was in a Queens hospital recovering from his 
gunshot wounds. Daniels claimed in the statement that the investigator offered 
him "an unspecified sum of cash to give evidence of possible recruiting 
violations by UNLV." Daniels claimed he refused the money and told the 
investigator that he knew of no such violations. 
</P>
<P>
In another sworn statement, Kevin Barry, the owner of a New York school bus 
company and Daniels' former roommate, claimed that an NCAA investigator told 
him that he and Daniels would be "great American heroes" if they provided the 
NCAA with information damaging to Tarkanian and UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said in an interview that he and Daniels provided the affidavits to 
"lawyers involved in the (UNLV) case." Barry said he could not identify the 
lawyers. "Coach Tarkanian would know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, however, said he has no connection to the affidavits. "The guy 
(Barry) called me and told me that they did it (made sworn statements)," he 
said. "Lloyd told a lot of people here (about the alleged bribe), but I have 
nothing to do with that. The one guy, Kevin Barry, called and told us that they 
(the NCAA) had been harassing him. But I'm not involved in that at all." 
</P>
<P>
David Berst, the NCAA's assistant executive director for enforcement, said he 
was aware of the affidavits but declined to comment on them. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA's tactics also were called into question last winter when investigator 
Robert Stroup went to a practice at Dixie College in St. George, Utah, to find 
Karl James, a point guard who played at UNLV during the 1987-88 season before 
transferring to Dixie. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Street, a student manager for the Dixie basketball team at the time, later 
told Dixie Coach Ken Wagner, who was not at the practice, that Stroup had said 
he was there to "do an article" on James. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner wrote the NCAA's Schultz to tell him of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner also told Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a little ticked off," Wagner said. "He said, 'I'll bet I can guess who 
(which investigator) it was.' He said the name, and that's who it was." 
</P>
<P>
Stroup referred all comment on the matter to Berst, who said: "Putting the best 
light on it, there may have been some form of miscommunication. If what they 
say is the truth, it may be a matter of somebody (Street) jumping to the 
conclusion that this guy (Stroup) was there to interview the player for a 
newspaper instead of interview him for another purpose." 
</P>
<P>
There is one factor that does make this bout with the NCAA a little different 
for UNLV: the presence of Maxson. 
</P>
<P>
Hired as UNLV's president in 1984, he has helped the school move away from its 
Blackjack U. image and become, as U.S. News and World Report put it last 
October, one of the "up-and-comers" among universities in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Maxson's public statements have been supportive of Tarkanian, but he has made 
it clear that basketball is not the university's reason to exist. 
</P>
<P>
Maxson talks with pride, for instance, about UNLV's decision last fall not to 
admit Dedan Thomas, a point guard from Taft High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas met NCAA admission standards under Proposition 48. But he failed to meet 
UNLV's admission standards for out-of-state students, and the school's 
admissions committee would not make an exception in his case. Thomas is 
currently playing at Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"He had an 800 on his boards (Scholastic Aptitude Test) but didn't have the 
grade-point (average)," Maxson said. "There's a feeling among faculty that, 
years ago, this person would be playing point guard for us right now." 
</P>
<P>
How will Maxson deal with the NCAA if its inquiry is upgraded to an official 
investigation, in which the school must answer to formal charges? 
</P>
<P>
"If there are any allegations from the NCAA, we will take the allotted time we 
have to review those allegations," he said. "Those that we don't think are 
accurate we will contest. And I don't mean in the courts. We're not going back 
to court. We will contest those (allegations) before the NCAA Infractions 
Committee. . . . Any allegations made against the university that are proven, 
that are documented, we will accept the consequences and take whatever 
corrective action we can to make sure those things don't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, in Maxson's view, UNLV will go by the book -- the NCAA manual. 
</P>
<P>
How will Tarkanian deal with this? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping they'll be fair with us," he said of the NCAA. "That's all. If 
they're fair with us, they're going to come up with three or four minor things, 
real minor things. If they're fair with us. If they try to screw us, I don't 
know what they're going to do. You're always scared."

PHILIP MORRIS TAKES HEAT, BURNS BRIGHTER; 
</P>
<P>
TOBACCO: THE INDUSTRY LEADER IS GROWING DESPITE A SHRINKING MARKET, BUT MANY 
ARE UPSET AT THE WAY THE MARLBORO MAN IS LASSOING NEW SMOKERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
With help from the Marlboro Man, an enormous advertising budget and growing 
demand overseas, the No. 1 cigarette maker is selling more smokes than ever 
despite a shrinking market at home. 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the success of Philip Morris USA reflects the scrappy 
tenacity of the domestic tobacco industry, which has taken an aggressive -- 
some critics would say hostile and unethical -- approach to selling cigarettes 
and combating health groups that want to restrict smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 55 to 60 million adults in this country who have made the choice to 
smoke," said Steve Weiss, a Philip Morris spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"What's frightening is that these anti-smoking groups are attempting to impose 
their own morality on the adult American public by trying to control the 
information they receive." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris hasn't been immune to the growing anti-smoking movement in the 
United States, which has played a role in reducing the market by about 2 
percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
That shrinkage is partly why Philip Morris USA's New York-based parent, Philip 
Morris Cos., acquired Kraft Inc. and Miller Brewing Co. years ago -- to protect 
itself by diversifying. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the tobacco arm of the conglomerate has been strengthening 
relative to competitors, with weapons that range from intense advertising to 
lobbying in Washington to a sales assault on virgin territory abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the roughly $636 million in domestic cigarette advertising in 1989 
was spent by Philip Morris, the trade newspaper Advertising Age has reported. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris held almost 42 percent of the U.S. cigarette market last year, 
said John Maxwell Jr., who follows the industry for Wheat First Securities in 
Richmond. The company had a 39.3% market share in 1988, up from 37.8% the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas, too, Philip Morris is doing extremely well. In Japan, for example, 
the company has benefited from a relaxation on imports and a demand for the 
mild Virginian tobacco it uses, to be blended in Japanese cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Pavlos Alexandrakis, who follows the industry for Argus Research, an investment 
advisory firm in New York, predicted that bigger and better-financed tobacco 
companies such as Philip Morris will get even bigger. 
</P>
<P>
"They can advertise more," Alexandrakis said. "They can throw more money behind 
product development and research." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Philip Morris' closest domestic competitor, RJR Nabisco Inc., may 
have little leeway in throwing money at new products, partly because it was 
sold last year in a record $25-billion takeover financed largely by debt. 
</P>
<P>
The one major new cigarette RJR has attempted, primarily aimed at blacks, 
generated a storm of accusations that the company was contributing to the 
health problems of minorities. RJR abruptly scrapped plans to test its Uptown 
brand last month in what was widely seen as a marketing catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris' brands are so self-sustaining that the company is not as 
pressured to concoct new ones, analysts say. Among the best known are Marlboro, 
Virginia Slims, Benson &amp; Hedges and Parliament. Of those, Marlboro is king 
and is the strongest among new smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"One out of four cigarettes smoked is Marlboro," Maxwell said. "Marlboro 
outsells the next largest international cigarette over two to one." 
</P>
<P>
The range-toughened Marlboro Man has been an icon of Philip Morris ads since 
1955, when it introduced the macho smoker with the butt dangling from his lips. 
The company has reacted angrily to recent efforts by anti-smoking groups to do 
away with him. 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society, for instance, is promoting legislation to be 
introduced in Congress this year that would limit cigarette ads to the brand 
name, the product and text about it. 
</P>
<P>
"People are being lured into something that kills them," said Joann 
Schellenbach, an American Cancer Society spokeswoman in New York. "One in six 
people that start smoking are going to die from something cigarette related. 
That's worse than Russian roulette." 
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general estimates that cigarettes cause an estimated 390,000 deaths 
a year in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he saw little chance that Congress would further restrict 
advertising by tobacco companies, already proscribed from peddling cigarettes 
on television and radio and forced to put health warnings on other ads. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a tremendous amount of opposition in this country to tinkering with 
the commercial free speech rights of any manufacturer," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than other cigarette makers, Philip Morris has seized upon the 
free speech issue as a tool to defend its business. The company even got its 
name on TV with an ad campaign about its sponsorship of a Bill of Rights 
commemoration, which some critics saw as a subtle way of promoting cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris has promoted cigarettes in other unconventional ways. At the 
company's cigarette factory in Richmond, for example, adult visitors are 
offered free cigarettes and all visitors can write friends on Philip Morris 
post cards with company-paid postage. The company also writes thank-you notes 
to visitors who sign the guest register. Hazards of smoking aren't mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking critics have become increasingly galled at what they see as the sleazy 
tactics used to peddle cigarettes by Philip Morris and other companies. Many 
say they are particularly angered by subtle appeals to the young. 
</P>
<P>
The tobacco industry has agreed to a code that it will not use models under 25 
to promote cigarettes. But many anti-smoking activists say the industry 
subverts that code by using over-25 models who appear to be kids. 
</P>
<P>
Others complain that cigarette makers intentionally place advertising 
billboards in places frequented by children.

'STEALTH' CAR GIZMO CUTS TWO WAYS

Police might like Kip Fuller for keeping drunks off the road, but they're not 
too happy that he helps speeders outwit radar traps by turning cars into ground 
versions of a stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller invented the Guardian Interlock, used by law enforcers in at least 18 
states, which deactivates a car's ignition system if the driver can't pass an 
alcohol breathalyzer test. 
</P>
<P>
The inventor's latest innovation is known as a stealth car bra, so named 
because it resembles a brassiere strapped to the front of a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Made of radar-absorbing carbon fibers, the bra enables a car to fool police 
radar until it reaches close range, permitting drivers to spot the trap and 
slow down before their speed is clocked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not anti-government," Fuller said. "I try to develop products that assist 
the government in doing its job." 
</P>
<P>
But how does a stealth car bra help the government? 
</P>
<P>
Fuller smiled. "It keeps them on their toes." 
</P>
<P>
His idea for the Guardian Interlock stems from his conviction for driving under 
the influence at age 19. Afterward, Fuller recalled in an interview, he asked 
himself why someone hadn't thought of a product that would help prevent drunk 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'why' part of that question got me thinking about a method of prevention. 
It sure would have helped me back then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To start a car equipped with the Guardian Interlock, a driver must breathe into 
a mouthpiece attached to an alcohol sensor for four seconds. If the driver's 
alcohol level is above the level deemed safe, the ignition remains locked. 
</P>
<P>
Judges around the country are ordering convicted drunk drivers to buy and 
install the $300 system in their vehicles as an alternative to paying fines or 
serving jail time, Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller's stealth car bra also resulted from experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, I was a little tired of getting speeding tickets. But more than 
that, I believe the government uses radar technology to generate revenue. The 
public has a right to defend itself if the government uses clandestine 
methods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Radar, he said, often gives inaccurate readings because the beam from a radar 
gun spreads like the light from a flashlight. Stealth technology forces a 
police officer to wait until the vehicle is closer to get a speed reading, 
improving a driver's chances of spotting the officer and slowing down first. 
</P>
<P>
"The bra protects drivers from unfair readings that result in unjustified 
speeding tickets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bra, which starts at $299 depending on the auto make and model, is 
custom-made to fit most domestic and foreign cars. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old's creations have gained him national and international 
recognition. As president and founder of Innovisions Research Co., he has 
combined inventiveness and marketing savvy to create a growing business. 
</P>

Innovisions, in operation just over a year, employs seven people full time and 
makes use of about 20 subcontractors. Revenue for 1990 is projected at about $2 
million, Fuller said.

The inventor's first financial success was the Servitron Robot, a vinyl, 
4-foot-tall, remote-control toy that serves drinks at parties. It racked up 
nearly $3 million in sales its first year. 
</P>
<P>
The influx of cash made it possible for Fuller to develop and market other 
creations: orthopedically designed pants for skiers with bad knees, a condo for 
cats, handles for skis and mitts for ice-scrapers.

"I just look at different areas objectively," he said. "Sometimes people in a 
specific industry are so close to the subject that they can't see the areas 
where improvements or additions are necessary. I try to remain the observer so 
I don't get too wrapped up in a product."

U.S.-STYLE CAPITALISM MAY NOT BE MODEL FOR EAST BLOC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With shocking speed, Soviet-style communism has vanished as an example for 
other nations to follow. But does that clear the way for U.S.-style capitalism 
to prevail in the world? 
</P>
<P>
Not necessarily. The social protections of Western Europe, the industrial 
conquests of Japan and the economic opportunities of America all have appeal. 
Fledgling governments in Eastern Europe, many believe, may select traits from 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll pick and choose," predicts Robert B. Reich, a professor at 
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. "I don't think they 
could or would tolerate the same degree of homelessness, crime and sheer 
poverty in their populations that we manage to tolerate in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Liberal critics of U.S. policy contend that the social democracies of Western 
Europe -- marked by strong safety nets, often at the expense of growth -- will 
hold more allure for Eastern Europe than bare-knuckles capitalism, with its 
winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
Others say the world's future role model will be based on economic performance 
and that neither America nor Western Europe will be the first choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty years ago, clearly the United States was the economic model," said Bruce 
R. Scott, a Harvard economist. "But if you look at the last 40 years and ask 
who's been the most successful in raising their standard of living, it's got to 
be the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever is right, fundamental American principles may deeply influence Eastern 
Europeans struggling to veer away from communism -- whatever examples they 
choose to follow. That is because all leading industrial democracies adhere to 
such time-honored U.S. values as the belief in private property and the rule of 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Europeans "should go back to Jefferson and Madison; there's nothing new 
since then," declared Jerry Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate 
Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the world's leading industrial democracies have much in common: They 
all rely on the profit motive, private ownership and competition in the 
marketplace, at least to some degree. For Eastern Europeans desperately seeking 
to revive their own economies, the right role model may prove to be whatever 
works for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jordan: "I think the message they've been sending -- to the people they 
kicked out and to the people who are jockeying to replace them is: 'We want 
results, dramatically better results. And we want to see them fast'."

RIDDING HOMES OF ASBESTOS CAN RESULT IN HEAVY EMOTIONAL COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Dyck recalls the loss that she felt last December when she walked into 
her Long Beach home that was stripped of its furnishings. Gone were the 
carpets, drapes and sofa. Gone, too, were her son's favorite toy -- a stuffed 
lion -- and all of her family's clothing, even her wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
Everything made of fabric that she, her husband and two children owned was gone 
for good. It had been bundled into an airtight container by workers in 
spacesuit garb and trucked to a toxic waste dump in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was that Dyck's home, which had undergone some remodeling, 
accidentally had been contaminated with asbestos, the potentially 
cancer-causing material commonly used in houses and other buildings constructed 
before 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived and ate and slept in it, and it makes my skin crawl," Dyck said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyck's experience is extreme, but not unusual. While much of the concern about 
asbestos exposure has focused on schools, airports, office buildings and other 
public places, environmental experts say many homeowners are unaware of the 
pollution danger lurking where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Awareness of the problem is growing as more homeowners remodel homes built in 
the '60s and '70s. Sometimes these do-it-yourself handymen, or the contractors 
they hire, do not realize -- or deliberately ignore -- the possibility that the 
textured ceiling they scrape contains asbestos, or that the vinyl floor they 
rip up is composed of or bonded with asbestos material, or that the old heating 
ducts they replace are wrapped in asbestos insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Such ignorance can lead to disaster, resulting in exposure to airborne asbestos 
-- which can be inhaled and ultimately cause health problems -- and requiring a 
costly cleanup by professional asbestos abatement crews. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are slowly coming to recognize the problem of asbestos in 
the home. As of Jan. 1, California law requires sellers of property to provide 
a written disclosure of known toxic hazards, including asbestos, to home 
buyers. An asbestos inspection may cost between $125 and $150. A few mortgage 
lenders are also beginning to require professional asbestos inspections in 
single-family homes. Ian Campbell, senior vice president of Great Western Bank, 
said the Los Angeles institution is developing a new policy that may include a 
check for asbestos in its appraisals of residential property. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, asbestos abatement contractors say they get the vast majority 
of their homeowner referrals not from lenders or brokers but from heating 
system installers and other contractors who discover asbestos in the course of 
their work. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, licensed abatement contractors contend that a great many unqualified 
contractors are working with asbestos out of ignorance or because they don't 
want to forfeit potential income. 
</P>
<P>
Under another new state law, all home renovations in which the amount of 
asbestos being removed is greater than 100 square feet must be reported to the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District, which inspects job sites. Also, a 
contractor removing asbestos from residences must be certified by the 
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
A contractor without proper certification who removes asbestos is subject to 
fines of up to $25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say 10% of contractors in California are actually complying with the 
law," said Joseph McLean Jr., vice president of P. W. Stephens, an asbestos 
abatement contractor based in City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The proper removal of asbestos "is not cheap," McLean observed. Removing 
heating ducts in a 1,500-square-foot home might run $2,000, he said, and 
removing a sprayed-on asbestos ceiling for "a smooth look" can cost an 
additional $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But asbestos experts note that a homeowner who gets his property inspected for 
asbestos before remodeling can avoid a much greater financial burden and health 
hazard. And in many instances, the best choice is to leave the asbestos where 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
Dyck wishes that she had known more when she hired a company to put a new roof 
on her home last August. The roofers, she said, dislodged sand, gravel and 
fiberglass that fell through slats into the house. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she hired an industrial cleaning crew to clean up the mess. They 
ran a vacuum on the asbestos-laden acoustical ceiling of the family room, 
causing a cloud of dust to fill the air and migrate through the entire 
three-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
After the cleaning, Dyck said, her baby daughter broke out in welts and her 
husband Lionel, a computer systems adviser for Rockwell International in Seal 
Beach, had continuous asthma attacks. They had the material tested and learned 
that it was asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Decontaminating the house took four months, during which the family lived in a 
hotel. Cleanup and restoration costs so far are about $64,000. But worse is the 
emotional toll that it has taken on the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten to 15 years from now, the four of us may not be alive," she said.

PRISON INMATES PAINT WITH THE BRUSH OF HOPE; 
</P>
<P>
3 ORANGE COUNTY INSTRUCTORS NURSE THEIR STUDENTS ALONG

<P>
With a critical eye, Gail Tomura surveys a painting of a woman cradling two 
children. She asks the artist for his brush and, taking it, adds highlights -- 
here, to the woman's hair, and there, to one child's face. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Humphrey watches and nods as Tomura's strokes create the desired effect. 
When she returns the brush, he mimics her movements, his face a mask of 
concentration. In front of easels scattered throughout the room are other men, 
equally intent, recreating scenes of snowy Vermont, a chapel in a wooded glen, 
a marlin thrashing in the waves off the coast of Baja. 
</P>
<P>
A radio plays softly -- sometimes classical music, sometimes jazz -- the sound 
broken only by Tomura's words of encouragement and the occasional scooting of a 
chair. The pace is slow and measured, the atmosphere relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Tomura imposes only one rule: No crumpling in her classroom. Crumpling a canvas 
will get you tossed out, though the men joke that the penalty is "60 days." 
These men know the meaning of time, and 60 days passes slowly. 
</P>
<P>
The men are inmates at the California Institution for Men, or CIM, in Chino. 
For them, art class is a privilege, something they look forward to. "They 
really enjoy and make use of the time they have in class. That's one of the 
reasons I like working out there," says Tomura, who lives in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain challenges I don't find with my community college classes," 
she concedes. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I teach them anything -- about brush strokes or values, shading -- I 
have to teach them patience, perseverance, that you can only get to step 10, a 
finished painting, by completing steps one through nine." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the men and women housed behind the sensor fences and guard towers have 
a history of trying to jump from one directly to 10, and of frustration and 
impatience, of giving up. Tomura sees "crumpling" as copping out in lieu of 
instant gratification. She tries to break such habits. 
</P>
<P>
"If I can get them to stick with a painting, they show themselves that they 
have ability. And if they have the ability to paint, maybe they have the 
ability to do a lot more," she observes. 
</P>
<P>
Tomura has taught at the minimum-security prison once a week for nearly two 
years. Her first assignment for the inmates is to copy the work of a master 
painter. "I have them pick something that the world has already said is 'good,' 
and try to copy it. 
</P>
<P>
"I give them a lot of help because I want their paintings, especially the 
first, to be a success . . . even if I have to do 75% of the work myself. I 
know if they finish it and choose to do another, I'll only have to do 50% of 
the work on that one, and pretty soon, they're on their own, they're 
confident." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the students to that level of confidence and independence is Tomura's 
main goal. It's an objective usually reached more quickly in the monotype 
workshops, led for the past four years by fellow Orange County artists Jonde 
Northcutt and Nick Capaci at the nearby California Institution for Women, or 
CIW, a maximum-security prison where sentences range from a year to life. 
</P>
<P>
With monotypes, an art form that blends printmaking, painting and drawing, 
results are almost immediate. While an inmate's first painting may take weeks 
or even months to complete, a daylong workshop can result in three or four 
monotypes. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage creative growth, Northcutt and Capaci, who are from Santa Ana, 
instill a simple precept: There are no mistakes -- no rights and no wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
"Let your 'mistakes' work for you," Capaci tells the women. "If something 
happens that you didn't plan on, work with it, let it lead you down another 
path. Take that accidental path and see where it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Life without mistakes is new for the inmates, and the difference is not lost on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt so completely inadequate that first day," a woman serving a life 
sentence recalls. "But I didn't say anything. I didn't want anyone to know. My 
defense mechanisms made me say I could do it, but inside I was saying, 'I 
can't.' It was so hard." 
</P>
<P>
"But you did it," notes Marge Tanner, a fellow inmate. "Nick and Jonde were 
there to help you, but you did it." 
</P>
<P>
Tanner's hesitant friend, who has asked to remain anonymous, smiles. "I was so 
excited when it came out. It felt so good. I couldn't believe I could make 
something pretty, something that someone would like." 
</P>
<P>
Tomura, Capaci and Northcutt have learned that most of the inmates have a 
narrow view of art and an even narrower view of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Their drawing in school didn't look like a horse, or whatever, and so they 
think they can't draw. No one ever told them that a horse didn't have to look a 
certain way," Northcutt says. "They've learned they're not creative, not 
capable. We try to teach them that they are." 
</P>
<P>
"I like my work to be tight, neat, clean," says a woman who has served about 
half her life at CIW. "Nick and Jonde made me see that I could loosen up, that 
I didn't have to be perfect. And that I could take an everyday object and use 
it in art -- or see art in the everyday object. That's neat. That's special." 
</P>
<P>
"When I step into this room, it's like I'm in a whole other world. I forget all 
about the yard and what goes on there," says Bob Boatman, an inmate at CIM, a 
gray-haired former machinist who favors small-town settings. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to get involved with that," he adds, gesturing to the yard and 
its weightlifters and handball players. "When you're painting, it's peaceful. 
You almost forget you're here." 
</P>
<P>
Artworks turned out in the classes -- landscapes of Zion and Yosemite national 
parks, depictions of the Wild West -- hang in public offices throughout the 
state, while murals and posters, some with anti-drug or anti-gang messages, are 
seen in schools, hospitals and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of giving something back to the community," says Tom Skelly, CIM's 
art-program coordinator. "I think people feel better supporting the program if 
they know the guys are giving something back. And the guys like to do something 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good thing," Earl Humphrey says during a break from painting. 
"We just did a mural for (Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). I'd like to 
visit there someday when I'm out and see what it looks like up on the wall. I 
feel good knowing we did something for those sick children. And their parents 
and the doctors and nurses." 
</P>
<P>
The program is not without its critics. People often bristle upon finding out 
that the inmates are learning to paint or write rather than moving rocks from 
one pile to another or making license plates. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my friends what I do and a lot of them get upset," says CIM 
Correctional Officer Ben Thall, who oversees the art classes. "They say, 'I pay 
tax dollars to put (criminals) away, not give them art lessons.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I see the benefits, and I explain that. I pay taxes, too, and I'm pretty 
critical of how my money's spent. The program works or I wouldn't support it. I 
wouldn't ask to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
The statewide program costs about $1 million a year, according to Susan Hill, 
director of Arts-Reach, the nonprofit organization hired by the state to 
provide programs at nine prisons. Studies show that inmates who participate in 
the program have a lower rate of recidivism and fewer behavioral problems than 
those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of extenuating circumstances, such as, it may be the inmates 
the program attracts have a more favorable prognosis, but I feel the art 
program has a real positive effect," says James Carlson, state 
Arts-in-Corrections manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the solution, but we're part of the solution," Hill says. "Time has 
shown us that people engaged in the program have higher self-esteem and 
self-discipline. I can't say all of them have the best job skills, but they've 
certainly learned to think things through, to solve problems rationally, to 
cooperate and to understand achievement." 
</P>
<P>
The inmates say they have little hope of learning to cope with life outside 
without first being taught the problem-solving skills and discipline provided 
by the art program. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people -- including other inmates -- just miss the whole point," says Ron 
Johnson, a participant in CIM's video art program. "We have to be responsible 
for our equipment, for ourselves. I firmly believe that if you give a person 
the chance to experience this, to really put his heart into it, he won't return 
(to prison). You feel useful, and a lot of people don't always feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
Those convinced of the program's success want to see it expanded. In addition 
to offering more programs to more people, Skelly would like to sell the 
inmates' artwork, dividing the proceeds among the artists, the art program and 
a victims' aid organization. Meanwhile, he and other artists have tried to 
obtain grants or other means for inmates to continue their work after parole. 
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation is a major part of the program, along with trying to expand the 
inmates' awareness and knowledge of art. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, these people could be out in a matter of months. They 
could move in next door," says Northcutt, gesturing to the neat, clipped lawns 
of her Santa Ana neighborhood. "I feel better knowing I've taught someone to 
patiently solve a problem, to think about the cause and effect. Even, to think 
about the beauty in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Though statistics and pie charts are needed to convince critics, attitudes 
impress those who work with the inmates. "The success shows itself in abstract 
ways," Tomura says. She points to one man who has been working on a single 
canvas since September. "That's a long time. Just the fact he hasn't given up 
is evidence that the program works. He knows it'll come if he keeps at it. He's 
seen that in the paintings done by the guys around him. He's working through 
the steps." 
</P>
<P>
Her enthusiasm is mirrored in the proud smiles flashed by Capaci and Northcutt 
as they show slides of the women's work at CIW. "You really see them grow, as 
artists and as people," Northcutt says. "They find some part of themselves they 
never knew existed. They find a positive outlet, a positive expression, for all 
their feelings and emotions. That's what keeps us going back." 
</P>
<P>
Back at his easel at the CIM, Earl Humphrey works diligently to bring mother 
and children "to life." The canvas, which a week before had been a somber and 
monochromatic brown, is now bright and full of color. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just the base," he explains to a visitor. "You build on that to get 
the color you want." Tomura is out of earshot, but surely his comments would 
make her proud. 
</P>
<P>
That, and no crumpling.

RANDY LEWIS: THE NEWS AS SEEN THROUGH SOVIET UNION'S EYES: FILM AT 11:30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Yes, it's February once again. Which means that out there in the vast 
wasteland, it's ratings sweeps time, and TV newscasts are at their, er, best. 
It's as though, between sweeps periods, the world spins along in suspended 
animation but now, suddenly, it has come alive: "The planet is in danger and by 
tomorrow it may be too late. Tune in Thursday!" 
</P>
<P>
Or, "Action News 2" and its "Home Sick Special" -- "Your own house could be 
poisoning you!" 
</P>
<P>
Sick of the fright-night tactics? Bored silly by yet another "Eye On L.A." 
excursion to Tahiti? Yearning for a news report that actually has some news? 
</P>
<P>
Try "Vremya," the Soviet Union's official daily national newscast, currently 
airing on Orange County Public Broadcasting System station KOCE (Channel 50) on 
a two-week trial run. "Vremya" made its debut Monday night in the 
less-than-prime-time 11:30 p.m. slot, but given that the best Los Angeles PBS 
station KCET (Channel 28) could do was the midnight time slot,we should be 
thankful. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, even though it's a show that most people probably won't find 
habit-forming, "Vremya" is a real eye-opener. For the unprecedented chance it 
offers -- to look through the same lens that filters the world for millions of 
Soviet citizens -- it's a must-see. 
</P>
<P>
"Vremya" is airing in dozens of U.S. cities, yet another tangible sign of the 
much-ballyhooed "new openness" between the two countries. Presumably, the 
Soviet people will be given a look at American television in exchange. Let's 
just hope -- for our sake and theirs -- it's not Geraldo's special on "When the 
Other Woman Is a Man." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's first 30-minute installment of "Vremya" was highly revelatory, more 
for what you could read between the lines than for actual information gleaned. 
What is most apparent is that production values, and even basic competence, are 
nowhere near the same as with national network news here. As Times Television 
Critic Howard Rosenberg pointed out, stories on "Vremya" sometimes "appear to 
have been edited (or censored) by chain saw." In that respect, "Vremya" more 
closely resembles the products of first-year college broadcasting students, or 
one of the slapdash local news shows that often pop up on public-access cable 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Far more significant than the technical shortcomings of "Vremya," though, are 
the differences in content between Soviet and U.S. newscasts. Monday's top 
story was a lengthy profile of a Soviet Buddhist leader running for political 
office, newsworthy because only recently have the Soviet Union's Buddhist 
communities been allowed by the Communist Party leadership in Moscow to 
participate in elections. The story itself suggested no illicit sexual liaisons 
with buxom secretaries; unearthed no private bouts with alcoholism, drug 
addiction or depression; and included no sideswipes at rival candidates. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, that approach may paint a falsely rosy picture of the Soviet 
political process, which certainly must suffer some of the same ills that 
plague ours. Still, it was downright refreshing to see a political piece that 
concentrated on issues and a candidate's positions and qualifications, not on 
his personal habits. 
</P>
<P>
The second story of the evening was a feature on a new electrolyte copper 
factory in the Ural Mountains. Reflecting the traditionally heavy Soviet 
emphasis on productivity and technology, much was made of the fact that this 
factory now is capable of turning out electrolyte copper film only 18 microns 
thick, where previously the thinnest it had been able to produce was 35 
microns. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose inquiring minds want to know. 
</P>
<P>
Again, hardly earth-shattering stuff in and of itself. But highly revealing for 
what the show's powers-that-be consider to be big news. The only time we're 
likely to see a major national news story on a manufacturing plant is if it 
explodes, closes and lays off thousands of workers, or if its operators have 
bilked the government on a multimillion-dollar defense contract. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of glasnost may hover over the Western world like Casper the 
Friendly Ghost, but "Vremya" is still filled with propaganda. Undoubtedly, 
though, it now is a more subtle brand than it must have been in the 
pre-Gorbachev era. Stories are laced with editorializing, praising the Soviet 
government and the character of the people. When mention is made of the 
U.S.S.R.'s less-enthralling accomplishments, clumsy attempts are made to 
ameliorate tragedies past. 
</P>
<P>
In one report, for instance, there was a reference to the Stalin era, now 
officially sanctioned as fair game for criticism. It was brought up as an 
example of "the terrifying pages of our past, which," we were quickly informed, 
"have passed forever. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The choice of two stories "Vremya" picked up about the United States was 
especially interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The first was about our very own oil spill off Huntington Beach. The snippet 
showed footage of waves crashing on Newport Beach as a voice-over explained 
that "as a result of an oil spill, the coastal waters of that state were 
contaminated." The whole state? "Due to precise work of the coastal service, 
the uses of cleaning services and volunteer assistance rendered by the 
population, it becomes possible to partly eliminate the consequences of the 
contamination." OK, so they won't win any Emmys for newswriting. 
</P>
<P>
The next segment was a report on last weekend's prison break from the Joliet 
Correctional Center in Illinois, complete with pictures of armed guards and 
German shepherds searching surrounding areas for the six escapees. 
</P>
<P>
Both were legitimate news stories, but given that they were the only stories 
about the United States shown by "Vremya," it would be easy to get the 
impression that this country is nothing but a polluted wasteland overrun by 
criminals. . . .

TANKER SPILL TO RAISE STORM OF INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time cleanup crews began dabbing at the American Trader's spilled cargo 
with absorbent pads last week, a host of officials, politicians and citizens 
had turned some of their attention from the oil-stained beaches toward a 
thicket of investigations. 
</P>
<P>
By week's end, at least two lawsuits -- one seeking $10 million for local 
gill-net fisherman, the other asking for unspecified damages on behalf of 
coastal residents and merchants -- already were filed. And inquiries and 
investigations of all kinds had been launched. 
</P>
<P>
No less than 40 state, federal and local entities are trying to ferret out what 
happened and who is financially liable for the spill that fouled 14 miles of 
beach, temporarily devastated the fishing industry, killed hundreds of marine 
birds and cost British Petroleum, which owned the oil and has coordinated the 
cleanup, an estimated $10 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coast Guard investigators conducting the lead inquiry began looking into 
every aspect of the mishap, from the accuracy of navigation charts to broader 
questions about whether large tankers should use the berth where 394,000 
gallons of oil spilled into the sea on Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians geared up for hearings, which could begin this spring. The state 
attorney general's office pulled together its investigative and legal team for 
a suit against the owners and operators of the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission initiated reviews of coastal leases with mooring 
terminals, state Fish and Game was assessing wildlife damage, the Coastal 
Commission was reviewing lessons from previous spills, and the city of 
Huntington Beach began scrutinizing its contract with the refinery that owns 
the offshore mooring. 
</P>
<P>
At the federal level, the Departments of Justice, Labor, Interior and 
Transportation -- along with their various sub-agencies, including the FBI -- 
also were in gear before the ship had even straggled back to Long Beach for 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Even New York-based American Trading Transportation Co., which owns the vessel, 
was running an in-house investigation, based on the presumption that the ship 
encountered waters more shallow than navigation charts indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the faintest idea what all these other groups are hoping to 
find," Sanford Schmidt, American Trading's president, said. "I really don't 
know how long all of this will take or where it will lead. I really don't." 
</P>
<P>
Investigations Spread 
</P>
<P>
Each investigative body will probe slightly different aspects of the accident, 
but all can be expected to focus on a few common points -- the depth of the 
water near the mooring where the accident occurred, the conduct of the captain 
and crew and the adequacy of the cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The full results of the probes are months, even years off, and could lead to 
civil penalties and stricter controls on the oil industry. Criminal charges are 
possible but not likely, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven days after the spill, key parts of the overall effort still rest with 
the Coast Guard, the lead agency in addressing the causes of the spill. 
Conducting the two-pronged investigation are Cmdr. Paul Larson, Lt. (j.g.) Neal 
Reardon and Lt. (j.g.) William Drelling. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the fact-finding stage, the evidence-gathering stage," said Cmdr. 
Scott Porter, assistant director of marine safety in California. "Every day 
they are coming across new leads that must be checked out. We are putting in a 
lot of hours." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials consider the American Trader inquiry an informal 
investigation because there was no loss of human life. The events leading to 
the accident are fairly clear, and investigators do not expect it to be 
especially difficult to unravel. Although they remain an option, formal panels 
of officials to take testimony about the accident are not necessary at this 
point, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the investigation has focused on the crew's conduct, the depth of the 
water around the mooring, the possibility of inaccurate navigational charts, 
and the position of the ship at the time of the accident, Porter said. 
Investigators are also reviewing broader questions about whether large tankers 
should use the offshore terminal owned by Golden West Refining Co. of Santa Fe 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The mooring master and American Trader's senior officers were all tested for 
drugs and alcohol in the hours immediately following the accident. Those tests 
came back negative, so impairment is not expected to figure in the further 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
How Deep Is Mooring? 
</P>
<P>
Those findings are among the few hard facts that have been released so far by 
the Coast Guard. Nevertheless, some of the points underlying the inquiry are 
already known: The 21-year-old American Trader is 811 feet long, 125 feet wide 
and can carry 565,000 barrels of oil. Its draft is 43.7 feet fully loaded, and 
shipping company officials have said it was full on Feb. 7, when it made its 
fateful approach toward the mooring off Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ships with drafts more than 43 feet or lengths greater than 1,000 feet are not 
allowed into the berth, which has charted depths of around 51 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The actual depth of the water is much at issue, however. Preliminary 
indications show that the tanker might have been operating in water five feet 
shallower than that indicated on depth charts when it struck its port anchor, 
puncturing the hull twice. 
</P>
<P>
Porter said the Coast Guard has received no official complaints from mariners 
about the waters around the Huntington Beach mooring, hence the depths noted on 
navigation charts have remained unchanged since at least 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Under way or in the planning stages are no less than three surveys to find out 
the actual depth around the mooring. Golden West, under orders from the Coast 
Guard, began to take soundings last week. 
</P>
<P>
American Trading Transportation Co. and British Petroleum also are surveying 
the bottom, and the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
wants to do an independent depth survey for the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Just how many surveys we need is a good question," Porter said. "I would hope 
one would suffice, but everyone has their own legal interest in this." 
</P>
<P>
With the depth at one offshore mooring in question, the Coast Guard has ordered 
an investigation at 15 other tanker moorings off the California coast to 
determine whether they may conceal hidden safety problems. No findings have 
been made yet. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure this is not a problem that could result in a disaster 
anywhere else," Porter said. "The fact that this one (off Huntington Beach) has 
been used safely for years and years and now there's a problem -- that 
certainly raises a question about the others." 
</P>
<P>
When their investigation is finished, Larson, Reardon and Drelling will submit 
their findings and recommendations to Coast Guard headquarters in Washington 
for approval. If the commandant's office concludes that new regulations are 
warranted to prevent similar mishaps, it can appeal to Congress for 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
If crew members are ultimately suspected of negligence or gross incompetence, 
they could face charges brought by the Coast Guard in federal administrative 
law courts. The civil proceeding, which is akin to a criminal trial, can result 
in reprimands, suspensions or revocations of marine credentials for the 
offending mariner. 
</P>
<P>
While that would end the Coast Guard's involvement with the case, it will 
barely mark the beginning of the broader investigation. Chief among the parties 
awaiting the Coast Guard's findings -- and already initiating inquiries of 
their own -- are two groups of plaintiffs who have filed suit against British 
Petroleum and American Trading Transportation Co. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to depose the captain, the people on watch, the people 
dropping the anchors, everybody," said Howard Sacks, an admiralty lawyer 
representing a group of gill-net fisherman. "We're going to want the fedometer 
readings (which indicate the depth of the water under a ship), the bell book 
(which indicates orders to the ship's engine room) and the ship's logs." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sacks notified the court that he hopes to depose the American 
Trader's captain, Robert La Ware, on Thursday. Sacks has also requested access 
to many of the ship's records. 
</P>
<P>
Who Pays, How Much 
</P>
<P>
As the lawsuits wind their way through the judicial system, a bevy of state 
agencies is launching investigations that will head in many directions at once. 
</P>
<P>
Air and water quality agencies say they will attempt to evaluate damage to the 
air, shoreline and ocean. Local governments are expected to try to discern the 
effects on tourism and land values. The U.S. Department of Transportation could 
exercise jurisdiction to investigate the effects of the spill on a 
transportation waterway. 
</P>
<P>
At the state level, the Lands Commission has already launched a review of the 
leases for 16 offshore oil terminals -- including the mooring where the 
American Trader spilled its load. A broader investigation of the facilities is 
expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Warren, executive director of the commission, said the agency "found 
nothing of concern" after meeting with Golden West executives and a cursory 
review of the company's lease and operating procedures. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to look at everything -- depth, oil spill plans, operating 
procedures, equipment and maybe some stuff we can't even think of right now," 
said Jim Trout, assistant executive director of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission is one of a half-dozen or so state agencies whose 
legal case against British Petroleum and American Trading Transportation will 
be borne by the state attorney general's office. The state agencies are lumped 
together as part of the Interagency Oil Spill Committee, which is convened in 
response to spills and which consists of agency representatives on loan to the 
coordinating group. 
</P>
<P>
Its findings, which will be months in the making, then go to the attorney 
general, who will be responsible for charting the central legal battle over the 
American Trader spill. Results of that battle will determine who pays -- and 
how much they pay -- for the environmental damage to Orange County and its 
coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's suit will likely parallel a 1988 case in which Shell Oil 
spilled 434,000 gallons of oil into water near Martinez in Northern California. 
The settlement in that case resulted in a $19.5-million payment by Shell to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, because our main interest is in restoring or replacing the damage to 
the environment, we're probably more interested in pursuing civil remedies" 
than criminal ones, said John Saurenman, a deputy attorney general in the Los 
Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, officials said that figuring out what to seek in terms of civil 
penalties poses perhaps the most complicated part of the inquiry. Federal 
prosecution under the Clean Water Act is also possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest part of the investigation right now is putting together a damage 
assessment," Saurenman said. "We need to determine how much all of this stuff 
is worth and who is liable for it, because we're going to be asking them for 
money." 
</P>
<P>
There are few guides in assessing the losses. But officials will rely on 
experts in an an obscure but increasingly significant field known as "economic 
valuation of wildlife" or "environmental valuation." 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't many easy answers," said Dave Dick, a public affairs officer for 
the Fish and Game Department. "How much is a deer or a gull or a wild animal 
worth? I don't think it's an exact science." 
</P>
<P>
All the same questions that bedevil legal and environmental experts will emerge 
at the center of a widening political inquiry into the accident as well, 
officials predicted. In Washington and in Sacramento, elected representatives 
have landed on the American Trader accident as vindication for an array of 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Some see it as a death-knell for offshore oil drilling; others see it as 
strengthening the case for those wells so fewer tankers will be needed. 
Proponents of legislation that would require tankers to be double-hulled argue 
that an investigation should focus in on whether the Feb. 7 spill would have 
happened had the American Trader not been a single-hulled vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The state Assembly's Select Committee on Oil Spill Prevention and Response 
Preparedness, which has subpoena power, is already planning to hold a hearing 
in Huntington Beach to evaluate the causes of the spill and the effectiveness 
of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Both subjects raise the tempers of committee leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"What were these guys doing with a full tanker steaming into shallow water?" 
asked Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro), vice chairman of the 
committee. "You can bet we're going to want some answers to that question."

AIR SPACE SAVED GIRL TRAPPED IN SNOW, SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Carrie Heimann survived Saturday because of a basketball-sized 
pocket of air created when she covered her face in desperation as a wall of 
snow descended on her. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only space she had. Trapped motionless in the snow for more than 90 
minutes, she thought she was going to die. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of lost track of the time. It was scary. There was no sound. It 
was complete quiet," said Carrie, a sophomore at Mater Dei High School in Santa 
Ana, as she rested late Saturday night at her parents' Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
At the point that she heard rescuers walking above her, then walking away, she 
gave up hope. But they came back and pulled her out of the snow. The first 
thing she said to them was, "My feet hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie, a drill team member at the school, had been buried by an avalanche 
while hiking with friends on a school outing in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kind of laid there doing nothing. They said I was under there for an 
hour and a half. I only had a little space in front of me. It was like the size 
of a basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Schoolmates and teachers had almost given up hope of finding the curly-haired, 
slim, 5-foot-5 girl during a frantic search by a team of Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies and rescue workers, aided by about 30 ski patrol members. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to avoid the panic," said Michael Corrigan, a teacher who 
organized the outing for members of the school's band and drill team. "We were 
just amazed she was OK. It was like a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Said Deputy Ben Garnes: "I honestly thought we were going to find her dead." 
</P>
<P>
Carrie, an avid member of the drill team, and about nine classmates went hiking 
about 9:30 a.m., some of the students said, despite their teacher's warning not 
to stray from their cabins at the Ester Christian Conference Center, where the 
group was staying for the weekend. As they grew cold and afraid, they started 
to turn back. Then one of the boys in the lead slipped, apparently setting off 
the avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a patch of snow and next thing I knew, the snow came down and wiped us 
all down the hill. . . ," said Aaron Cox, 16. "The snow was up to my neck and I 
was struggling to keep my head above the snow." 
</P>
<P>
Not until their legs were buckled under by the snow did some of the students 
realize they were in an avalanche. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically I was too worried trying to hold on to decide whether I was scared," 
said Bowen Goletz, a junior at Mater Dei. "It was just a wall of snow and 
fortunately I was near a tree and I was able to hold onto it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I was able to catch another member of the group," Goletz continued. "He was 
basically sliding by and I held out an arm and he grabbed it." 
</P>
<P>
After the students tried in vain to find Carrie, some stayed behind to dig in 
the snow while others ran back to the camp to ask Corrigan to call for help. 
Many of the more than 80 students and 15 chaperones dug frantically with their 
hands until rescue workers arrived about 20 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
The rescuers soon responded to the emergency call. They formed a line at either 
end of the avalanche, which was about 40 feet wide and 300 feet long, and 
methodically worked their way toward the middle, Corrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Working in unison they moved slowly, taking one step at time, stopping, sinking 
long search poles into the snow, and then repeating the procedure again and 
again. At last, one of the rescue workers called out. 
</P>
<P>
"One at the top hollered 'We found something! . . . We found her! . . . She's 
conscious! . . . She knows her name,' " Corrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was treated for frostbite and released early Saturday evening from 
Palmdale Hospital Medical Center. She then headed home to Santa Ana with her 
parents, Patti and Tom Heimann. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the rescuers visited Carrie at the hospital to make sure she was all 
right, said Patti Heimann. 
</P>
<P>
"The rescue workers said a lot of times, they just have bad news. They just 
said a lot of times it's not a real happy ending. . . . At least this one time, 
they could be happy with us. It turned out all right."

POLICE KILL 2 DOGS AFTER PLACENTIA BOY IS MAULED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-year-old boy received more than 150 stitches Saturday after he was mauled 
by two dogs while he played near his apartment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers, who responded to the scene of the mauling, were also attacked and 
they shot and killed both dogs, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia Sgt. Russ Rice said the incident occurred around 1:50 p.m. while the 
boy played in a grassy area of the Villa Tierra apartment complex in the 1600 
block of Orchard Drive. The boy was waiting for his mother, who was in a nearby 
laundry room, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two dogs, which police believe were "German shepherd mixes," charged the 
boy and threw him to the ground. The dogs then bit him on his right shoulder, 
arm, neck and leg. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy got up and ran and (had) nearly made it back to his apartment when a 
neighbor came out and shooed the dogs away," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics rushed the boy to Placentia-Linda Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"There were about 10 severe bites . . . all on the right side of his body," 
said nursing supervisor Amelia Schmid. "Some were between 2 to 5 inches wide. 
He had other bruises and puncture wounds. This was more extensive than we 
typically see." 
</P>
<P>
Schmid said the boy -- whose name is being withheld because he is a juvenile -- 
was released in satisfactory condition. 
</P>
<P>
Russ said that when officers arrived on the scene, they found the two dogs 
outside the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
The officers cornered the dogs in a nearby area where there are oil derricks, 
Rice said. "One dog leaped over a six-foot cinder-block wall that had barbed 
wire on top of it. The other charged one of the officers. He was shot." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said another officer found the other dog in a nearby residential area. "He 
also charged (the officer) and he was shot," Rice added. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said police turned over the dogs' carcasses to Orange County Animal 
Control. So far, investigators have not been able to find their owners, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't believe they were from the apartments. The tenants are not allowed to 
have animals," Rice said. "And these are not your typical apartment dogs. . . . 
German shepherds weigh at least 90 pounds. But the officers said these were 
possibly larger." 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday, investigators were going door-to-door and scrutinizing 
lost-and-found notices on telephone poles to attempt to find the owners. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of Villa Tierra said they had seen the dogs roaming inside the 
apartment complex about half an hour before the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"They were acting pretty skittish," said David Eastwood. "If they didn't have 
fiber ropes dangling from their necks, I would have thought that they were wild 
because they resembled coyotes. They appeared scared when the wind was 
blowing." 
</P>
<P>
The attack came two weeks after a pair of Rottweilers mauled 6-year-old Jeffrey 
Kerley as he played with a friend in front of his Westminster home. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey required 75 stitches for the dog bites he received on his legs, arms, 
abdomen, back and buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
The incident has prompted some residents to petition the Westminster City 
Council to pass an ordinance further restricting vicious dogs. After seeing 
photographs of Jeffrey's wounds, council members asked the city staff to make 
recommendations on restrictions.

FAMILY TO GET $5 MILLION FOR BOAT-RACE DEATH 
</P>

<P>
The organizers of a 1985 boat race on Lake Irvine in which a 9-year-old girl 
was killed said Saturday that they have reached a $5-million settlement with 
the girl's family. The National Drag Boat Assn. also announced plans to revive 
the racing series that was suspended after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Branchflower was watching the boat race with her parents and younger 
brother when a hydroplane-style drag boat careened out of control and veered 
onto the shore, instantly killing the girl and sending spectators fleeing in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
Branchflower's family filed suit against organizers and sponsors of the race, 
alleging that they were negligent in failing to take adequate safety 
precautions. A portion of the settlement, lawyers said, will be set aside for 
her younger brother, who witnessed the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The National Drag Boat Assn. organized the ill-fated race in April, 1985, and 
another the following year. But its racing series throughout California was 
canceled in 1986 when sponsors withdrew from the events after the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Rob Grasso, president of the association, said the series would be 
restarted because the Branchflower suit has been settled. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time we'd ever had a serious incident like this," Grasso 
said. "I just have to be confident that we'll continue to do that, and 
hopefully there won't be another accident. . . . It's just another factor that 
will always be in the back of our minds when we go to make safety regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The Branchflowers, who live in Burbank, have declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've just been through too much," said a woman who answered the phone at 
the Branchflower home and identified herself as the girl's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas M. Indovino, a lawyer for the racing association, said that the 
manufacturer recalled the steering mechanism in the boat as a result of the 
accident. Indovino, who was at Lake Irvine on the day of the accident, said he 
suspected a faulty steering mechanism almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Indovino, a former boat racer and world record holder, said the driver of the 
boat in the accident was "also a victim." 
</P>
<P>
"I felt he did everything he could possibly do to avoid the accident," he said. 
"He was faced with a situation where he had no steering. . . . He turned the 
engine off. He put out the parachute and it was just too late. . . . Outwardly, 
he appeared to be in shock." 
</P>
<P>
Indovino said that about 10 defendants named in the suit agreed to buy an 
annuity, which will make payments totaling $5 million to the family spread over 
their lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the parties to the settlement, Indovino said, are: 
</P>
<P>
* Casale Engineering, the makers of the steering mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
* The National Drag Boat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
* The driver of the boat. 
</P>
<P>
* The companies that were hired to provide security during the race. 
</P>
<P>
* Irvine Boat and Tackle Inc., which operated the facility on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
* Adolph Coors Co., which promoted the race. 
</P>
<P>
James Lange, the driver, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Grasso said Lange is still "terribly upset" by the accident and that, although 
Lange has returned to racing, he has never fully recovered from the shock. 
</P>
<P>
Grasso also recalled his own shock after learning that a girl had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It really struck home," Grasso said, who was at the event in 1985 but did not 
see the accident. "I locked myself in the car and sat there for an hour or so 
and just tried to clear my head. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to the Branchflowers. . . . I just felt so sorry for them."

BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.

<TEXT>
<P>
The image of "little cable cars climbing halfway to the stars" usually conjures 
up thoughts of San Francisco, but Orange County can also be colored into that 
scenario -- if only from the standpoint of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
Until the middle of the century, railway cars were a mainstay of transportation 
for county residents, carrying passengers back and forth from outlying areas to 
resort communities. 
</P>
<P>
This intricate, interurban system of street cars, dubbed "The Red Cars," kept 
Southern California mobile from Santa Monica to Riverside to Newport Beach, and 
helped stimulate population growth. 
</P>
<P>
Operated by Pacific Electric Railway Co., the cars ran down the middle of the 
street. They were powered by overhead electrical lines and guided by rail 
tracks. However, with the advent of the automobile, the Depression and the 
federal government giving subsidies for California's freeway system, the 
popularity of the system began to wane during the 1930s. By the '60s, it had 
altogether disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday at 7 p.m., the old cars will come to life, if only for a little 
while, as historian William Myers of Southern California Edison acts as guest 
curator at a free lecture and slide show entitled "The Red Car of Orange 
County" at the Old Courthouse Museum at 211 W. Santa Ana Blvd., Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit will run in tandem with a related display, "Street Rail to Light 
Rail: California's Trolleys," sponsored by the California State Archives. "The 
Red Car of Orange County" is sponsored by the Orange County Historical 
Commission, and both exhibits will run through March 26. For more information, 
call the Old Courthouse Museum at (714) 834-3703 or (714) 834-5536. DALLAS M.

Bird Hot Line -- A telephone hot line has been established for residents who 
spot oil-injured birds. The number, (714) 536-0202, is staffed daily from 7 
a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some birds victimized by the oil spill may be found miles inland, blown there 
by strong westerly winds. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who find such birds are urged to call the hot line rather than pick 
the bird up -- sick birds might be injured if picked up or transported by 
untrained persons. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Fish and Game is looking for volunteers to help clean 
the birds. The agency is asking for a commitment of at least three days because 
of the training involved. Information: (213) 831-4070. 
</P>
<P>
New at the Zoo -- Two adult bald eagles have made their debut in a new exhibit 
at the Santa Ana Zoo. The naturalistic space imitates a rocky stream bed 
surrounded by forest. 
</P>
<P>
Both eagles are from the Midwest and suffered wing damage in the wild. Zoo 
officials say they plan to use the new exhibit to illustrate to visitors the 
plight of birds of prey. Illegal hunting, pesticides and loss of habitat have 
reduced bald eagle populations, except along the coasts of Alaska and British 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the endangered birds died from the effects of the major oil 
spill last year off Valdez, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Coming Up -- The Wild Mushroom Fair, sponsored by the Los Angeles Mycological 
Society, will return to the Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport 
Beach on March 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $2, with children 12 and 
under admitted free. Information: (714) 640-7120. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana Zoo celebrates its 38th birthday on March 10, beginning at 11 
a.m. Several activities are planned for children and adults. Information: (714) 
836-4000.

UCI'S STREAK ENDS AT 15 IN 98-97 VICTORY

The buzzer was ringing and Rod Palmer was half-running, half-skipping toward UC 
Irvine's bench Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Before he could get there, his teammates engulfed him just as he hurled the 
ball into the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
The Thunderdome, as UC Santa Barbara's Campus Events Center is known, was oddly 
quiet, save for the Anteaters screaming and hugging at midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos stood where they had been when Gary Gray's last-second try was 
smothered by the Anteater defense. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine had beaten Santa Barbara, 98-97, ending a school-record losing streak 
that spanned 15 games and two months and a day. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 5,395 saw Irvine (3-20 overall, 1-13 and still in last place in the 
Big West Conference) shoot a season-best 56.1% from the field and score a 
season-high 98 points. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd sent the decibel meter at one end of the arena soaring to 107 as 
Irvine's Ricky Butler stood at the free throw line with 20 seconds left and the 
Anteaters trailing, 97-96. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine had just blown a 10-point lead in the last 2:24, but now Butler had a 
chance to give the Anteaters the lead. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't look good. Butler came into the game shooting 59.3% at the line. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who would say later that he had never been in a position to win the 
game at the line, tried to block out the noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really thinking of anything, just concentrating," he said. "I looked 
up and saw it (the decibel meter) was 100." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who had been fouled by Lucius Davis as he tried a layup, swished the 
first shot for a 97-97 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the din rose. The second shot hit the back of the rim and fell 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the percentages, you don't figure he's going to knock both down," 
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara (17-7, 10-5 in third place) hurried the ball into the frontcourt, 
but did not take a timeout. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos worked the ball to Eric McArthur, who had made 10 of 13 from the 
field and had 21 points at that point. 
</P>
<P>
But he missed a 12-foot jump shot from the left side with Butler tightly 
guarding him. The ball bounced into the right-hand corner where Idris Jones 
turned and missed a hurried 15-foot jumper. Gray rebounded, and the buzzer went 
off as he tried a two-handed throw at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"What a relief after the buzzer went off," said Palmer, a senior guard who had 
11 points and nine assists. "Man, it feels so good. I kind of forgot what it's 
like to win." 
</P>
<P>
Dylan Rigdon, a freshman guard, had 24 points to lead Irvine. He made six of 
eight three-point baskets in hitting his career high. This after a dismal 
six-point performance in Thursday's 102-63 loss at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing," Rigdon said. "It was my first big-time college game. The 
crowd's into it, there's 5,000 people screaming and it's a one-point game." 
</P>
<P>
And, for once in a long time, a victory for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman had 22 points, making eight of 11 from the field, including a 
driving one-handed dunk that put Irvine ahead, 93-85, with 3:06 left. Butler 
also had 22, making eight of 10. 
</P>
<P>
After Paul Johnson made two free throws with 38 seconds left, the Gauchos led, 
97-96, and Irvine appeared to have blown another chance to break its lengthy 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters led, 95-85, after two free throws by Palmer with 2:44 left. But 
it all started to come apart. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick DeHart, who led Santa Barbara with 30 points, hit a jumper in the lane. 
Later, he would make an NBA-range three-pointer as the Gauchos crept to within 
four, 96-92. 
</P>
<P>
Davis made another three-pointer after McArthur stole an inbounds pass from 
Palmer and Santa Barbara was down, 96-95. The Gauchos could thank the long arms 
of McArthur for that one. He stands 6 feet 7, but his arm span is a startling 
7-3. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's leading rebounder, McArthur had 13 on Saturday to become the 
school's career leader with 837, breaking Doug Rex's mark of 829 (1968-71). 
</P>
<P>
Rigdon was then called for charging and the crowd was roaring. McArthur, 
setting up for an eight-footer in the key, walked under pressure from Herdman 
giving Irvine possession. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters didn't have it long. Butler was called for an offensive foul, 
trying to free Rigdon, who was dribbling into the frontcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, leveled by Butler, stood at the line and made both shots. 
</P>
<P>
As he did, Butler was thinking, "I hope I get a chance to win it for us." 
</P>
<P>
When a driving Herdman fed an open Butler under the basket, the Gauchos had no 
choice but to foul Butler or give up an uncontested layup. 
</P>
<P>
He made both free throws, but Irvine still had to sweat out the final 20 
seconds and three last-gasp shots. 
</P>
<P>
AT AN END, AT LAST

Danielle Silva and Carrie Yoshioka led a 13-3 fourth-quarter run that gave El

<P>
With a 59-56 overtime victory over visiting Esperanza Saturday night, Orange 
High School advanced further in the Southern Section 5-A playoffs than any 
school basketball team since the 1958 boys' champion. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone 14-2 since Dec. 20," Orange Coach Ed Prange said. "We just wore 
them down with our pressure defense." 
</P>
<P>
It took a while for the Lady Panthers' pressure to take full effect, however. 
Esperanza (21-5) built a 51-41 lead after three quarters behind a team-high 19 
points from Jennifer Harney and and 12 points from Michele Fujioka. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lady Aztecs would score only five points in the final 11 minutes, as 
Orange (18-6), which has an 8-1 record at its home gym "The Dome," staged a 
frantic rally with Ginnie Hall scoring 14 of her season-high 23 points, in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"Esperanza did a great job of holding Nicole Champion (11 points) down 
tonight," Prange said. "She scored 28 in our first-round win, but Hall hit some 
big shots for us tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Laurie Sallinger also made key free throws for the Lady Panthers, sinking 
both ends of a one-and-one with 1:49 left in overtime for a 57-55 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Orange only made 23 of 38 free throws (61%) and Esperanza went to foul line 
only 18 times. Orange was assessed six fouls in the second half to 16 for 
Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
"You figure it out, they're the one's pressing and reaching, and we only get to 
the line 18 times." Esperanza Coach Mac Hill said. "But you've got to give them 
credit, we didn't go out and execute tonight while they did." 
</P>
<P>
In other 5-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 47, West Covina 43 -- Ocean View trailed, 30-19, at halftime as 
Jenny Sullivan and Fabiola Nunez each sat out most of the second quarter with 
three fouls . Tracy Wolfe, who had nine points in the first half to keep Ocean 
View (25-2) in the game, finished with 19 points, 18 rebounds and six blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario 66, Marina 57 -- Ontario (27-0) outscored Marina, 14-9, in the third 
quarter to take control. Marina pulled within three points with a minute and a 
half remaining but could not get closer. Marina missed eight fourth-quarter 
free throws. Melisa Sortino had 19 points, including school record 15 of 18 
from the free throw line, to lead Marina. Colleen Hatch scored 13 points and 10 
rebounds for Marina. Ontario's Chrissy Sweeney scored 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 56, Santa Barbara 50 -- Alisa Farr had 24 points and nine 
rebounds to pace the Cougars (18-9) at Capistrano Valley. Farr, a sophomore 
guard, made three three-point baskets and 11 of 13 free throws. Kristin Knapp 
had 22 points for Santa Barbara (23-6). Teresa Doesberg had 11 points and Erin 
Grondzik 10 for Capistrano Valley.

<P>
Canyon High School's wrestling team won its third Southern Section 4-A 
championship in four years on Saturday at Edison High School. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, which won titles in 1984, 1987 and '88, won the championship with 159.5 
points and qualified six of its wrestlers for the the Masters tournament next 
Saturday at Fountain Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake was second with 112 points and Indio took third with 108. Other Orange 
County schools' placing in the tournament: El Modena (fifth, 97.5), Edison 
(sixth, 95.5), Huntington Beach (eighth, 84), Irvine (ninth, 72), and Esperanza 
(10th, 70). 
</P>
<P>
"We came back from Friday's preliminaries trailing Indio by one point; I 
thought we were in a tough squeeze," Canyon Coach Gary Bowden said. "I told the 
kids they would have to wrestle exceptionally well Saturday and they did. I'm 
really proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon senior Zach Cooper won the 191-pound weight class with a 16-1 technical 
fall over Westlake's Dave Schumm. Cooper, who has won 87 consecutive matches 
and is 30-0 this season, last lost in the 1988 championships. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he felt ill, Cooper said he still went out and wrestled hard. 
"There's something about wrestling that makes me feel better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to Canyon's victory was Jason Mitchell (42-2), who decisioned 
Los Alamitos' Amir Yates (42-5-1) for the 138-pound title. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County champions included El Toro's Dave Garcia (145), who pinned 
Irvine's Dave Piquette in 3:01, and Huntington Beach's Matt Smith (165), who 
pinned El Modena's Eric Jacobs in 2:57. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Canyon, 10 county schools qualified wrestlers for the Masters: 
Edison and El Modena (five); Esperanza and Huntington Beach (four); San 
Clemente (three); El Dorado, Irvine and Los Alamitos (two); and El Toro and 
Mission Viejo (one).

LANDLORDS COPE WITH THE HIGH COST OF ASBESTOS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE HISTORY OF A SANTA ANA BUILDING SHOWS HOW POTENTIAL HEALTH 
HAZARDS AND THE FORMIDABLE TASK OF CLEANUP ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL ON THE VALUE 
OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES.

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1978, Dr. Arthur Lorber bought a six-story office building that was within 
walking distance of the Santa Ana Civic Center. The physician figured the aging 
structure, which was mostly occupied by county agencies, would be a good 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, the agencies moved to county-owned offices. The building, 
whose lobby was renovated, has been mostly vacant since. Unable to attract new 
tenants, Lorber would like to sell the structure but knows it will be at a low 
price. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm emotionally just sick of the place," said Lorber, who lives in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
There is little wonder. He estimates his loss at $70,000 a year on the empty 
building at 811 N. Broadway. While there are a number of problems with the 
property, Lorber believes his "long tale of woe" is linked to a single culprit: 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
The grayish, fibrous mineral was sprayed on the steel beams of the building for 
fireproofing when it was built in 1954. And its continued presence there is 
scaring off prospective tenants, brokers and lenders, Lorber said. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos was banned in 1979 from most construction uses because it is a 
carcinogen that can cause lung cancer and a debilitating lung ailment known as 
asbestosis. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says asbestos is only 
dangerous if the microscopic fibers are inhaled, where they may be harbored in 
the lungs 10 to 40 years before creating medical symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA estimates there are 730,000 public and commercial buildings nationwide 
that contain potentially dangerous asbestos. While there is growing public 
concern over exposure to asbestos, the agency does not require -- or even 
recommend -- its removal from commercial buildings unless it is in a 
deteriorating state. 
</P>
<P>
For Lorber and other property owners, asbestos represents a perplexing problem. 
There is no agreement among government, scientific and industry officials on 
acceptable levels of exposure to asbestos. Nor is there agreement on the best 
abatement measures. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of clear guidelines regarding asbestos places a heavy burden on 
businesses. Deciding how to deal with the potential hazard raises serious 
questions involving financing, real estate competition, public opinion, health 
and safety, and legal liability. 
</P>
<P>
"The (real estate) industry is really getting whipsawed with conflicting 
statements from government agencies and there are not a lot of hard facts on 
either side," complained Geoffrey Ely, executive director of the Building 
Owners and Managers Assn. of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of owners of older commercial buildings already have paid millions of 
dollars to remove asbestos, which was used as insulation or for fire- and 
sound-proofing. It is found in acoustical tiles, sprayed on ceilings or steel 
beams, and wrapped around heating pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of asbestos from commercial structures is taking place even though 
the law does not require such severe abatement and a recent study concludes 
that removal can be more of a health hazard than leaving it alone. 
</P>
<P>
The study published in last month's Science magazine said the removal of 
"previously undamaged or encapsulated asbestos can lead to an increase in 
airborne concentrations of fibers in buildings . . . and can result in problems 
with safe removal and disposal." 
</P>
<P>
It also said the potential hazard depends on the type and size of the asbestos 
fibers released into the air and that "malignancies or functional impairment" 
will not occur as the result of exposure to most airborne concentrations of 
asbestos in buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the study say it goes to extremes in discounting the danger from 
asbestos. "They shouldn't be telling people don't worry about it," said 
Christopher Gale, a partner in Asbestos Advisory Associates, a consulting firm 
in Redondo Beach. "Some people are still sitting back playing ostrich and 
hoping it will go away," 
</P>
<P>
The removal of asbestos from a commercial building is only legally required if 
a structure is to be demolished. Still, most removal is undertaken as part of 
renovations. In 1989, 3,485 removal projects in apartments, schools, industrial 
and office buildings were reported to the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Removing asbestos is an expensive and painstaking job that involves isolating 
the affected area in plastic draping, carefully scraping off the contaminated 
material, watering it down, and hauling it in bags to specially designated 
dumps. By law the work must be done by specially licensed contractors who take 
precautions to protect the health of their workers -- who must wear respirators 
and protective clothing -- and of tenants who continue to work in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of asbestos can be very costly, ranging from $12 to $30 a square foot 
for the abatement work and up to $200 a square foot after adding other factors 
such as lost income and the costs of moving tenants and reconstruction. Lorber 
estimates it would cost up to $600,000 to remove asbestos from his building -- 
that represents about a third of the structure's value. 
</P>
<P>
The potential costs of asbestos removal are now commonly factored into sales 
transactions. Owners of older properties -- including some very large 
skyscrapers throughout the nation -- have sold at substantial discounts because 
they contained asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the $620 million that Shuwa Investment Co. paid for Arco Plaza 
in 1986 reflected the cost of up to $35 million for the asbestos removal 
project now about 40% completed in the two 50-story office buildings, a Shuwa 
spokesman said. In New York, the 1988 sale of the former J.C. Penney 
headquarters for $322 million took into account the $9 million later spent to 
remove asbestos from that structure, according to the broker involved. 
</P>
<P>
But the reason for asbestos removal often reflects concerns other than health 
and safety. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion often is a major factor. Many companies prefer to be rid of the 
asbestos -- whether they see is as a danger or not -- simply to avoid problems 
with tenants or others who may fear it as an environmental hazard. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. was one of the first landlords in Orange County to remove 
asbestos from some of its buildings. It spent $21 million in 1985 to take 
asbestos out of some of its prime high-rise office buildings in Newport Center 
because of concern about public perception of the potential hazard, said Peter 
Tietz, the company's vice president of asset mangement. 
</P>
<P>
But economic concerns -- protecting the value of an investment -- appear to 
outweigh public image or health and safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say there is more asbestos abatement in the country to protect 
economic value than to protect the public health," said Howard Spielman, 
president of Health Science Associates, a Los Alamitos consulting firm that 
advises landlords on how to deal with asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Those who make a living advising building owners on how to deal with asbestos 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing behind the asbestos scare is the marketplace," said Joel Moskowitz, 
head of the environmental practice group in the Los Angeles law offices of 
Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. "People will not pay full value for buildings with 
asbestos.," 
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz said that while laws requiring asbestos abatement in private office 
buildings and apartment houses are "almost nonexistent," buyers and lenders 
fear that more stringent regulations may be just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want to buy what you might call 'regulation futures,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining this belief, Carol Coy, AQMD assistant director for enforcement, 
said she doubts if the most recently published study on the dangers of asbestos 
removal would stop such undertakings by most building owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will have a significant impact because of the overall mind 
set that asbestos is a potential liability," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That is the main concern of bankers and other major lenders, such as insurance 
companies, that provide financing for the acquisition of commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Alan E. Horwitz, a partner at Kenneth Leventhal, a Los Angeles accounting firm 
that specializes in real estate consulting, said a recent survey by the firm 
revealed that "lenders generally will not lend on buildings encumbered with 
asbestos and if they do they require a set-aside of the loan funds to remove 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"The general procedure (required by lenders) is removal rather than other 
abatement," Horwitz said. "Most are less concerned about the actual (health) 
damage than the market damage and the potential for litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Tucci, vice president and manger of the Newport Beach office of Wells 
Fargo Realty Finance, a mortgage banking subsidiary of Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 
said if a potential buyer of a building with asbestos came to him for 
financing, "we would be very hesitant." He said his company generally sells its 
mortgages to life insurance companies "and they are not interested" in such 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The concern of lenders, he said, is that the ultimate cost of asbestos cleanup 
if it becomes necessary might be greater than the loan itself and the building 
owner could walk away from the property, leaving the lender with the liability. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ortwein, president of the Koll Co.'s Southern California division, said 
that company "won't buy a building that has asbestos in it because it is next 
to impossible to finance." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hargrove, an industrial and commercial real estate broker with Lee 
&amp; Associates in Irvine, said, "I wouldn't buy a building unless the owner 
retained title to the asbestos. That's what I would do. It sounds corny but 
(asbestos) is a hot item and it is scary." 
</P>
<P>
Building owners and lenders say they are particularly frightened by the 
long-term liability of asbestos even after it is removed from a building and 
deposited in a landfill. They worry that if it later pollutes the environment, 
they may be sued for damages. 
</P>
<P>
David Grant, director of operations for South Coast Plaza, the giant regional 
shopping mall in Costa Mesa where an asbestos removal program has been under 
way more than four years, said the mall's owner, C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, 
has taken extraordinary precautions to protect the health of the abatement crew 
and shoppers. In addition, he said, a consultant carefully selected a dump -- 
Kettleman near Bakersfield -- that it doesn't expect to be targeted by the 
federal government for a future cleanup that Segerstrom would be required to 
help fund. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos is putting older buildings at an increasing disadvantage with newer 
competitors in attracting tenants, real estate experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Some government agencies which have been traditional tenants of lower-rent 
space in older structures now are shunning these same buildings. The state of 
California has a policy against entering into new leases in private buildings 
that have asbestos even if the problem is being professionally managed. The 
state is also removing asbestos from buildings it owns. 
</P>
<P>
While Orange County government does not have a blanket policy prohibiting 
leases in buildings with asbestos, some building owners and brokers say that in 
reality the county avoids them. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Geraghty, an agent in the County of Orange real estate division, said he 
personally will not put a county agency in a building with asbestos. The 
reason, he said, is "if you want to do minor alterations, it turns into a major 
abatement problem. If you want an extra electric outlet, for example, the 
outlet would cost $10 and the abatement could cost tens of thousands of 
dollars. We should just stay away from old buildings. That's the key," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Private businesses are also becoming more skittish about leasing in buildings 
with asbestos. "Tenants are getting more knowledgeable. The bigger they are the 
more likely they are to have a policy against renting space with asbestos in 
it," said Horwitz of Kenneth Leventhal. 
</P>
<P>
One reason, say lawyers, is that employers worry that disgruntled employees may 
later hit them with lawsuits alleging that they were exposed to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant concerns about asbestos are being exploited in some cases by brokers 
representing newer buildings. Wayne Williamson, a broker and manager with First 
American Business Property in Santa Ana, said, "If a building has asbestos in 
it, it is where you go to call for tenants for your new projects" that don't 
have asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial tenants and brokers have become more aware of asbestos as a result 
of new state laws that went into effect over the last three years that require 
landlords and their sales agents to notify tenants, contractors and prospective 
buyers if they know the presence of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
While there is no law that landlords go out of their way to learn whether their 
buildings contain asbestos, lenders, buyers and real estate management 
companies increasingly are requiring professional surveys. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to manage a building with asbestos," said Steve Wiegman, 
a former property manager for an older building in Santa Ana. "You have to give 
tenants notice and they panic." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Littell, a commercial property manager based in Irvine, said he interprets 
the law to mean he must disclose the presence of asbestos to everyone who comes 
into the building, including those who make deliveries. "It is an absolute 
circus," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos removal tends to be the most popular method of abatement for owners of 
top-grade high rise office buildings who have to compete with more modern 
towers and have to make frequent reconfigurations of office space for their 
tenants, each of which presents an asbestos management challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem lies whenever we have to go and refurbish a space for new tenants, 
which is on the average of every three to five years," said Doug Morehead, 
president of Optima Capital Management Inc., a Newport Beach company that 
manages commercial office buildings throughout California and Arizona. "If you 
do the work without removing the asbestos it can add $10 to $20 a square foot 
to the cost of improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Tietz of the Irvine Co. said the company decided to remove asbestos from its 
elite high-rises at Newport Center as an alternative to repeatedly paying a 
premium for tenant renovations. "In the long run you are burning up the money 
one way or the other," he noted. But he added that the company does not intend 
to remove asbestos from two four-story office buildings it owns near John Wayne 
Airport that are not the highest grade and are less frequently remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Garity, a partner in charge of real estate consulting for Peat Marwick in 
Los Angeles, said in today's soft office market most owners of less prestigious 
office buildings are "not removing asbestos unless they have to because there 
is great uncertainty they will lease up even if you take the asbestos out of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Landlords, however, say that municipal ordinances in some cities such as Los 
Angeles and Glendale that require sprinklers to be installed in the ceilings of 
older high-rise office buildings are making them remove from ceiling asbestos 
that they otherwise would have lived with. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, which contains 16 older, non-sprinkler high-rises, a sprinkler 
ordinance for older buildings so far has been successfully opposed by building 
owners. Meanwhile, the Legislature is considering a sprinkler law for older 
buildings that would apply statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Morehead said he plans to remove asbestos while installing sprinklers in a 
Westwoood high-rise in part because the presence of sprinklers could increase 
the danger. "If they (the sprinklers) went off and washed the contaminants to 
the lower floors, you have really got a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many building managers, Morehead said he is trying to attack the asbestos 
one floor at a time in the 12-story Avco Center Building in Westwood. He is 
devising a plan he likens to "a giant checkerboard" to shift tenants from the 
affected floor to other spaces. He also says he will hire a consultant to 
monitor the work of the asbestos removal contractor to see that it is done 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to do what is right," Morehead said. "We are trying to remove 
(asbestos) when necessary and also do it as economically as possible."

Nancy Dyck recalls the loss she felt last December when she walked into her 
home, stripped of its furnishings. Gone were the carpets, drapes and sofa. 
Gone, too, were her son's favorite toy, a stuffed lion, and all of her family's 
clothing, even her wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
Everything that she, her husband and two children owned made of fabric was gone 
for good. It had been bundled into an airtight container by workers in 
spacesuit garb and trucked to a toxic waste dump in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was that Dyck's home, which had undergone some remodeling, 
accidentally had been contaminated by workers with asbestos, the potentially 
cancer-causing material commonly used in houses and other buildings constructed 
before 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived and ate and slept in it and it makes my skin crawl," Dyck said. 
</P>
<P>
Dyck's experience is extreme, but not unusual. While much of the concern about 
asbestos exposure has focused on schools, airports, office buildings and other 
public places, environmental experts say that many homeowners are unaware of 
the pollution danger lurking where they live. 
</P>
<P>
Awareness of the problem is growing as more homeowners remodel homes built in 
the '60s and '70s. Sometimes these do-it-your-self handymen -- or the small 
contractors they hire -- do not realized -- or deliberately ignore -- that the 
textured ceiling they scape contains asbestos, or the vinyl floor they rip up 
is composed of or bonded with asbestos material, or the old heating ducts they 
replace are wrapped in asbestos insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Such ignorance can result in disaster -- resulting in exposure to airborne 
asbestos, which can be inhaled and ultimately cause health problems, and 
requiring a costly cleanup by professional asbestos-abatement crews. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are slowly coming to recognize the problem of asbestos in 
the home. As of Jan. 1, California law requires sellers of property to provide 
a written disclosure of known toxic hazards, including asbestos, to home 
buyers. An asbestos inspection costs about $125 to $150. A few mortgage lenders 
also are beginning to require professional asbestos inspections in 
single-family homes. Ian Campbell, senior vice president of Great Western Bank, 
said the Los Angeles-based institution is developing a new policy that may 
include an asbestos inspection in its appraisals of residential property. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, asbestos-abatement contractors say they get the vast majority 
of their homeowner referrals not from lenders or brokers but from 
heating-system installers and other contractors who discover asbestos in the 
course of their work. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, licensed abatement contractors contend that a great many unqualified 
contractors are still working with asbestos out of ignorance or because they 
don't want to forfeit potential income. 
</P>
<P>
Under another new state law, all home renovations where the amount of asbestos 
being removed is greater than 100 square feet must be reported to the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District, which inspects job sites. Also, a 
contractor removing asbestos from residences must be certified by the 
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
An uncertified contractor who removes asbestos is subject to fines of up to 
$25,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say 10% of contractors in California are actually complying with the 
law," said Joseph McLean Jr., vice president of P.W. Stephens, an 
asbestos-abatement contractor based in the City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
The proper removal of asbestos "is not cheap," McLean observed. Removing 
heating ducts in a 1,500-square-foot home might run $2,000, he said, and 
removing a gravel-textured asbestos ceiling for "a smooth look" can cost an 
additional $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
But asbestos experts note that a homeowner who gets his property inspected for 
asbestos before remodeling can avoid a much greater financial burden and health 
hazard. And in many instances, the best choice is to leave the asbestos where 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Raczka is happy to have spent $177.50 recently on the services of a 
licensed asbestos-inspection firm before remodeling her two-story house in 
Cowan Heights in the hills north of Tustin. Ultimately, she decided not to 
remove the asbestos vinyl on her kitchen floor and instead to lay a new wood 
floor over it. And she learned that she has asbestos in her heating-duct 
insulation that should be removed if it deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
Raczka said she believes the price of inspection was "very reasonable for the 
safety of my family." She said she is warning her neighbors about asbestos, 
"but some have already ripped up their vinyl flooring so they can't do anything 
about it. People aren't aware of the problem. They almost don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
Dyck wishes she had known more when she hired a company to put a new roof on 
her home last August. The roofers, she said, dislodged sand, gravel and 
fiberglass that fell through slats into the house. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she hired an industrial cleaning crew to clean up the mess. They 
ran a vacuum on the asbestos-laden acoustical ceiling of the family room, 
causing a cloud of dust to fill the air and filter through the entire 
three-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
After the cleanup, Dyck said, her baby daughter broke out in welts and her 
husband, Lionel, a computer-systems adviser for Rockwell International in Seal 
Beach, had continuous asthma attacks. They had the material tested and learned 
it was asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Decontaminating the house took four months, during which the family lived in a 
hotel. Cleanup and restoration costs so far are about $64,000. But worse is the 
emotional toll it has taken on the family. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten to 15 years from now, the four of us may not be alive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ASBESTOS HAZARDS IN THE HOME 
</P>
<P>
Here is a list of the most common sources of asbestos found in Southern 
California homes, ranked according to the health risk they present: 
</P>
<P>
1. Artificial ashes: 
</P>
<P>
These were commonly used in gas fireplaces prior to being banned in 1978. They 
contain 90% to 100% asbestos and readily shed fibers. 
</P>
<P>
2. Asbestos heater ducts: 
</P>
<P>
Looking like corrugated cardboard and sometimes faced with metal foil, these 
were widely used in Southern California prior to 1977 and contain from 35% to 
90% asbestos. If damaged, the ducts may shed fibers that can be blown 
throughout the living area. 
</P>
<P>
3. Pipe or boiler insulation: 
</P>
<P>
Generally used in connection with radiant heating systems, steam radiators and 
boiler systems. 
</P>
<P>
4. Contaminated basements or crawl spaces: 
</P>
<P>
Deteriorating asbestos material may "shed" asbestos fibers that can present a 
hazard to anyone who attempts to vacuum, sweep or in any way disturb dust in a 
basement or crawl space. Cleanup should be left to a professional. 
</P>
<P>
5. Asbestos inside heater registers: 
</P>
<P>
Tape containing asbestos can be found behind the grating of registers in 
forced-air and convection heating systems. 
</P>
<P>
6. Heater duct insulation: 
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1977, metal heating ducts were often covered with insulation 
containing up to 90% asbestos. One type, called air-cell insulation, can be 
identified by ridges on its surface. Another type is covered with a gray or 
grayish-white papery material and lacks ridges. 
</P>
<P>
7. Asbestos-backed linoleum and floor tiles: 
</P>
<P>
Both the flooring and the adhesives used to install it may contain asbestos, 
but these pose little risk if left undisturbed. Asbestos was banned from these 
materials in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
8. Fuse box liners: 
</P>
<P>
Old wooden fuse boxes may be lined with material containing up to 90% asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
9. Textured acoustical ceilings: 
</P>
<P>
Before 1979, approximately 80% of sprayed, decorative acoustic ceilings 
contained asbestos, usually from 1% to 5%, although some may have up to 40%. 
Such "cottage cheese" ceilings tend not to pose a hazard unless damaged or 
disturbed -- by a leaking roof, a child's bouncing ball, or by draperies 
brushing against them. Experts suggest using a damp paper towel to remove 
cobwebs, instead of sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
10. Roofing felts and tars: 
</P>
<P>
Many contain from 10% to 15% asbestos, but felt must be heavily worn or damaged 
to release fibers and tars rarely do. 
</P>
<P>
Other sources: 
</P>
<P>
These include joint compounds and patching plaster made prior to 1979 (3% to 
10% asbestos), artificial fireplace logs (20% to 45%), insulation on old 
knob-and-tube electrical wiring (50% to 60% asbestos), and asphalt-asbestos 
shingles used for roofing and walls( 20% to 40%). All of these sources tend to 
release fibers only if damaged during remodeling.
