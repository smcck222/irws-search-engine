I have stopped watching "Married . . . With Children" since it has become 
extremely sleazy. Please don't insult our intelligence with your canned

Brandon Tartikoff is the most powerful man in television. He has used that 
power this season to bring viewers kinky bondage scenes in two major films, 
"Favorite Son" and "Full Exposure: The Sex Tapes Scandal," as well as Geraldo 
Rivera's lurid and lavishly illustrated special on satanism. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, is now taking a 
shellacking in the press for his excessive bad taste. His reaction: "Why am I 
being picked on?" 
</P>
<P>
CBS puts on sleazy shows, too, but that network also has taken the high road 
with the magnificent Western miniseries "Lonesome Dove." ABC has had many 
lowly, squalid moments but also invested millions of dollars and 30 hours of 
prime time in the monumental miniseries "War and Remembrance." 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a soft ball, it really is," Tartikoff says of the charge that NBC 
puts on trash while the other networks offer quality. "Sex Tapes" aired 
opposite the first night of "Lonesome Dove." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff says it would have been foolish to put an expensive, prestige item 
opposite "Lonesome Dove." He says "Sex Tapes" was just good counterprogramming. 
But no, he is not proud of the film. 
</P>
<P>
"The only sin I think 'Sex Tapes' was guilty of is that it was a rather 
pathetic movie," Tartikoff says. "I think the thing should have been fully 
sponsored by Sominex." But the film's sex scenes did not cause a major protest, 
Tartikoff says. "We got only 45 phone calls on 'Sex Tapes,' and I think 10 of 
those were people complaining about bad reception." 
</P>
<P>
As for "Favorite Son," which included such scenes as a woman tying a man to a 
bed with lavender ribbons, Tartikoff is more remorseful. "If I had it to do all 
over again, I certainly would have excised the three scenes in 'Favorite Son' 
that got all the attention," he says. 
</P>
<P>
One could look on the bright side and say that at least Tartikoff feels a 
certain embarrassment over the subterranean depths to which NBC has stooped. Of 
the "Sex Tapes" show he says, "It's over and it's done with. People write as if 
this kind of thing were never done before, and as if we're the only ones doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
After all, he says, one night's episode of "Lonesome Dove" had rapes and 
scalpings. "I've got to do it in Western garb. That's what I've got to do," he 
concludes. 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to tick off Tartikoff (and why not?, the money he makes), 
just suggest to him that NBC, while still first in the ratings, has surrendered 
the mantle of "quality network" to ABC, which is doing more ambitious and 
unusual shows this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that's what they're saying," says Tartikoff. "I look around and I give 
them (ABC) 'Roseanne,' but that's it. What else is there? It's like Steve 
Allen. He's written 1,000 songs -- name one. Then I see the stuff they have 
that isn't working: 'A Man Called Hawk,' 'Murphy's Law,' 'A Fine Romance,' 
'Studio 5-B,' and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"They did 'Roseanne' and now they've taken my mantle? How did they get my 
mantle with that?" 
</P>
<P>
But, it is pointed out to Tartikoff, ABC also offers viewers such challenging 
shows as "China Beach" and "thirty-something." He is not impressed. "I don't 
think 'China Beach' is a good television show," he says. " 'thirtysomething' is 
a very narrow show." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff is asked why NBC hasn't done a movie or miniseries in a league with 
"War and Remembrance" or "Lonesome Dove." He says the forthcoming miniseries 
remake of "Around the World in 80 Days" will be "all-family entertainment," if 
hardly revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it breakthrough television? It will probably be as slow as 'War and 
Remembrance,' " he jokes. "Is it 'Shogun' or 'Roots' or 'Holocaust'? No, but I 
don't think 'War and Remembrance' or 'Lonesome Dove' were as good as those 
either. In terms of sheer weight, I suppose you have to credit 'War and 
Remembrance.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff says NBC has quality programming ahead, including a new prime-time 
effort from the tirelessly imaginative Jim Henson, creator of the Muppets. It 
will air at the beginning of April. NBC's "Dream Street," a new series about 
life in blue-collar New Jersey, will air in March; it was created by the 
producers of that "narrow" show, "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously sensitive to the charge that he's bringing more trash than class to 
television, Tartikoff says last year's writers' strike has made this a freak 
among television seasons. "We do some good things around here," Tartikoff says 
defensively. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, not enough of them.

By MARY JO MCCONAHAY, Mary Jo McConahay is an associate editor at Pacific News 
Service in San Francisco.

<TEXT>
<P>
ON A SHADY STREET IN Santa Monica, the trim white house, enclosed like a warm 
secret by a low-clipped hedge, is quiet. Inside, a 2 1/2-year-old boy lies in a 
darkened room on his Mickey Mouse sheets, his blond hair falling in wet strings 
across his forehead, his pillow still damp with the perspiration that comes 
with deep sleep in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
His mother isn't home. Instead, a Salvadoran woman hovers near the nursery 
door. "Hi, Michael. No sleeping?" 
</P>
<P>
Marta Perez * sweeps in wearing a loose floral housedress. She has kicked off 
her shoes to accommodate feet that tend to swell slightly late in the day. "Up, 
hola! Feet down, please. Vaya, good!" 
</P>
<P>
While Perez dresses the boy in overalls and a shirt printed with He-Man 
figures, they converse with all the spirit and creativity of a chatty woman new 
to the English language and a chatty toddler new to any language at all. 
</P>
<P>
Even a first-time visitor to this house can read the silent details that spell 
out a modern family's concern for its children. On the kitchen counter is a 
homemade cherry pie baked by the boy's mother, Sally Cooper, before she left 
for work. Taped to the refrigerator, among the finger paintings, is a barbecue 
invitation from Cooper's Lamaze group. In the den, next to a framed photo of 
the boy, are the videotapes: "Sesame Street" and pregnancy exercise routines. 
</P>
<P>
When Cooper comes home at 5 p.m. she sinks her six-months-pregnant body down on 
the living-room couch and regards her son and Perez fondly as they march past 
on their way out to the yard. "He adores her," she says simply. 
</P>
<P>
An experiment is unfolding here. The Cooper house is a laboratory of sorts 
where Latino and Anglo worlds are touching in an extended, intimate, first 
meeting. In unprecedented numbers, all over Southern California, women like 
Sally Cooper are hiring women like Marta Perez to come into their homes and 
take care of their children. Such arrangements will surely affect the future of 
this region, where rapid demographic change means that the Anglo and Latino 
worlds soon are bound either to mesh or to clash on a grander scale. 
</P>
<P>
SALLY COOPER WAS NOT born to a life of luxury in which servants were taken for 
granted. She and her husband, Don, a contractor, are on their way up. She is 
33, an accountant and one of the booming number of older, first-time mothers. 
"I think I'm like a lot of women," she says. "We've already worked for a long 
time, and when we're pregnant we think, 'There's no way I'm going to be able to 
stay home all the time. I need someone to help.' " 
</P>
<P>
Going back to work, however, is not so easy. "This little baby comes into your 
life and you can't bear the thought of leaving him," Cooper says. "I went 
through a lot of feeling guilty and weighing it out. Should I or shouldn't I? 
</P>
<P>
"When I grew up, our moms spent a lot of time with kids, not just at home but 
around events at school and church, and that's the kind of environment, with 
Mom in the picture, that surrounded us. Now, to pursue our own needs, we're 
subjecting our children to an experiment." 
</P>
<P>
Her eyes focus on something in the distance and show that she is wrestling with 
the imagined implications of what she has said. She blurts out the bottom line: 
"What choice do I have?" she says. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that she can count on Perez, hired as a housekeeper when Cooper was 
pregnant with Michael, helps quell Cooper's fears. If putting the baby in 
outside day care were the only affordable option, Cooper says, the decision to 
go back to work would have been even harder. 
</P>
<P>
Her face relaxes again. Through the floor-to-ceiling window, which is steaming 
up now as the air cools outside, Perez and Michael pose in gentle play among 
bright yard furniture. Perez offers a sweater that the boy rejects with wide 
shakes of his head. But a few moments later, he is snugly buttoned into his 
cardigan, standing on a bench, trying to braid Perez's hair. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper tilts her own blond head onto the back of the sofa, her full body and 
clear-cut features a languid American echo of the art on the wall above. There, 
a South Seas womanstares out of the frame, quiet but regal, mistress of the 
stretch of tropical sand where she kneels at rest. 
</P>
<P>
AT ANOTHER TIME, PEREZ is standing stiffly before the same couch, resisting all 
entreaties to sit down. She has been talking as she cleaned house and minded 
the boy about her native El Salvador, about her brother who was killed there 
two years ago "by gunshots from unknown men in civilian clothes," a sort of 
code phrase for murder by death squad. She has changed into a clean white dress 
for the two-hour bus trip back to her home in East Los Angeles. Michael is 
playing quietly on the carpet with a toy car, Cooper is late coming home and 
Perez is too anxious to sit. A wet stain appears at her breasts, then spreads 
quickly over the front of her dress. She has her own baby at home, a 
12-week-old boy she last nursed when it was still dark this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 33, remarried when she came to Los Angeles. She and her husband, another 
Salvadoran refugee, have another little boy, Roger, now 6. Like Cooper, Perez 
wrestles with questions about separation from her children, including three she 
left behind in El Salvador. She worries especially about the oldest, now 17, 
who must leave the protection of relatives and look for work. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sad because she is there, but how can I send for her?" she says. "It's 
difficult to come the way I came -- the way she would have to come -- walking 
for hours, without shoes because the kind of shoes we bring break early in the 
trip. Night marches. Men who abuse the young girls on the way. It makes me too 
afraid to think about it." 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon, Perez's sister, Lineth, who works as a part-time housekeeper in 
several Anglo homes, surprises Perez by dropping by to pick her up. Perez is 
excited because the ride home means that she will save enough time to see Roger 
while it is still light outside. Except on weekends, she usually only sees him 
by the light of a lamp. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters consider their lives success stories. They have made their way out 
of a caldron of war and dead ends at home. They work steadily for people they 
like, making three to four times the weekly salaries they earned when they 
first arrived in this country, and they are safer from la migra -- the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service -- than they might be in a factory or 
picking crops. Their coveted jobs do come with a price, however, paid by the 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
"I get home at night and Roger is sleepy," Perez says. "Then I get up early 
again and have to leave. I look in at him quietly before I go, but sometimes 
that wakes him up and he says, 'Don't go to work.' I tell him, 'Look, little 
papa, we are lucky I have the job.' But it's hard for him to understand." 
</P>
<P>
GO TO ANY WESTSIDE PARK, to toddler story times at the Santa Monica public 
libraries or to infant exercise classes in Pacific Palisades, and you'll see 
them: Spanish-speaking women wheeling their Anglo charges. Wealthy Americans 
have long enjoyed live-in or daily help raising their children. What's new 
today -- and especially visible in certain areas of Los Angeles -- is how 
widespread the custom is becoming among families who don't consider themselves 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than half of U.S. women with children under age 3 work outside the 
home. For most, in-home child care is preferable but unaffordable. For those 
who can afford it, it may be more available in Southern California than 
anywhere else in the country -- the demand here has coincided with the arrival 
of tens of thousands of refugees and immigrants from Central America. Like 
Marta Perez, the women among them will do domestic work for wages a Sally 
Cooper can afford -- $150 will buy a 24-hour-a-day live-in baby sitter and 
housekeeper for a six-day week in the L.A. area, although women with excellent 
English, work documents and a driver's license might command as much as $300. 
</P>
<P>
No hard data is available on the new child-care workers and their employers, 
and without it, academics, government agencies, even labor organizers won't 
venture estimates of their numbers. Ruth E. Zambrana of the UCLA School of 
Social Welfare, an expert on immigrant women and health, offered a thumbnail 
sketch of the bigger picture, citing "impressions and observations, not 
empirical evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The use of of Latina nannies is increasing with the increase in working 
mothers, Zambrana observes. Once, Latina baby sitters in Southern California 
were typically from Mexico, but a shift began in the early 1980s. "Right now in 
Los Angeles," Zambrana says, "we have a dramatically changed scene -- the women 
are coming from El Salvador and Guatemala too." They fall into two groups: 
single women leaving war-ravaged countries for better opportunities and a 
"significant," perhaps higher, number of married women desperate to make enough 
money to send home to their own children. Employers are generally families in 
which both husband and wife have careers. The low wages have also made nannies 
available to a broad group of single-income families -- not just the very 
well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
For all their visibility, however, these arrangements are part of an officially 
invisible underground economy. Although the Anglos interviewed for this story 
are the kind of people unlikely to even run a red light, they know or suspect 
that their employees, for the most part, are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 2-year-old Immigration Reform and Control Act, anyone who knowingly 
hires an immigrant without proper papers could be fined up to $10,000 and even 
go to jail for up to six months. Although a Texas couple was fined $350 in a 
rare case involving a housekeeper, no such cases have been brought in the L.A. 
area, says John Belluardo, a spokesman for the INS Western Region. "Enforcement 
focuses primarily on corporate employers," he says, adding, "That is not to 
send a signal to individuals that they are free to hire illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
It is a picture that demolishes the Mary Poppins image. The nannies have no 
safety net, no benefits or Social Security. There is enormous turnover among 
all day-care workers, probably because the economic incentive to stay isn't 
there, and Latina nannies are no exception. Madeline Stoner, an assistant 
professor of social welfare at USC and an expert on the history of child care, 
says, "This is not a position our society values by making it well paid." 
</P>
<P>
Church and community workers sometimes play matchmaker between new immigrants 
and families. Some agencies in Los Angeles specialize in placing such care 
givers. They require a document such as a green card to prove a job applicant 
is here legally, but, as one agency owner admitted ruefully, she has no way of 
proving that the documents are authentic. At any rate, it is not the agencies 
that are answering the demand. Much more typical are informal matches. When 
Marta Perez arrived, for instance, she paid a Guatemalan woman in her 
neighborhood $50 to find her a first job; by now, Perez figures that she 
herself has placed seven Guatemalans and Salvadorans, at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Kramer, another Anglo mother, who lives in Pacific Palisades, describes 
the underground network: "No one I know has to look more than two weeks (for 
help). You just put the word out and it's there." 
</P>
<P>
IN KRAMER'S NEIGHBORHOOD, homes look so much like the American dream that 
owners rent them out for TV commercials. Donna Kramer, who is married to an 
attorney and doesn't work outside the home, is kept as busy managing her 
household as the mistress of a medieval manor might have been. Last year she 
hired Esperanza Flores, who is Salvadoran, to clean house and take care of 
Marissa, 5, and Garr, 8. In some ways it was a match made in heaven, even if 
neither Kramer nor Flores might have predicted it a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer says when she and her best friend, Vera, used to talk about having 
someone in the home, they decided "it just didn't sound like it would be a 
comfortable situation. I remember we'd say, 'I just can't imagine somebody else 
doing all the little things. It would be like losing a kind of freedom in your 
own house.' We sort of both laugh now because Vera has someone living in and so 
do I." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the Latin American women who care for children in Los Angeles 
homes, Flores is expected to do housework too. Kramer is not the kind of 
employer who compulsively cleans a room before the housekeeper gets to it, nor 
does she speak in terms of guilt. "I never feel like I am neglecting my 
children," she says. "I just need to be out, and I have a live-in because I 
want to leave them with someone I trust. Also, I don't get any great pleasure 
out of cleaning my house." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, meanwhile, says she is finally earning enough to send $150 "every 20 
days" to her children in San Salvador. As she sits at the mahogany dinette off 
the spotless kitchen, Marissa's arms slung around her neck, it's hard to 
picture Flores at home on the southeast edge of that capital. That neighborhood 
has unpaved streets and no bus service, and after a good rain it is common to 
hear that a house has slipped down the sides of the huge ravine. Because an 
army garrison is nearby, Flores says, she and her neighbors lived in fear, 
"from one minute to the next," that their teen-age sons might be forced into 
conscription. At night, inevitably, silence is torn by bursts of automatic 
weapons fire. 
</P>
<P>
In San Salvador, Flores -- whose husband deserted her -- ran a small store out 
of her house and supported her boys and a daughter, now 14, "over a period of 
16 years when I wasn't apart from my children even one night." The war hung on 
and sharpened. Finally, when the place was robbed, she couldn't get help from 
authorities, who blamed guerrillas. "It was a lie," she says, but to contradict 
the police was to bring suspicion on her own head. Flores doesn't entertain the 
question of whether she is an economic, war or political refugee. "I am here to 
earn enough to feed the children at home, to help my girl out of there and to 
pay for my boys to study and prepare themselves," she says. "How long will it 
take? I don't know. But this is the way I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
Even the most apparently symbiotic relationship has trouble spots. It rattles 
Kramer that her desire to treat Flores as a member of the family clashes 
agonizingly with her need to tell her what to do -- a typical problem of women 
who are employing servants for the first time. Kramer is especially distressed 
today because the weekend is approaching. Flores has Sundays off and has taken 
to asking on Saturday afternoons whether she might leave early to go to the 
room she rents near Hoover and Vermont. Replacing her for an evening with a 
local baby sitter is not an option. "The teen-agers up here don't need to 
work," Kramer laments. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Flores will feel bad about staying Saturday night, and whether 
Kramer will feel bad insisting that she does, goes to the heart of the 
relationship between the two women. They depend on each other and do not want 
to offend each other. Flores is part of the household, but she is not part of 
the family. She insists that she has her own family that "I never forget about 
for a moment." Kramer, meanwhile, wants Flores to feel "at home," which she 
isn't, and is embarrassed to admit that, with a busy life but no outside job 
and a live-in maid / baby sitter, she feels "decadent." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes young Garr seems to reflect his mother's confusion. One night Flores 
is playing a favorite game with the children. As she chases them with a mop, 
they jump out of her way or hide, giggling when she pretends she can't reach 
them. Playing hard, Garr smashes his fingers in a door and screams in pain to 
his mother upstairs. Flores is devastated, yet through his tears Garr wants 
before all else to defend her.. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't her fault," he sobs. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell her," encourages Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
"I will in a minute," he agrees, his cries mellowing to a whimper. "Right now 
my finger hurts." 
</P>
<P>
But the next morning, Garr lashes out in anger because Kramer is leaving. 
Flores tries to comfort him and divert his attention. Garr looks at her and 
screams, "I don't want you," and other things that Kramer won't repeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard him talk to anyone like that before," Kramer says. "Maybe he 
thought it was OK because she can't understand English." 
</P>
<P>
AT NIGHT IN HER ROOM DOWNSTAIRS, Flores studies two books Kramer bought for 
her. One is a Dr. Seuss dictionary in Spanish and English, with bold color 
pictures of objects such as "hen" and "boat." The other is "Home Maid Spanish." 
It was written in the 1960s, which dates it for its new market; the holidays 
section, for instance, lists only Mexican national days. It contains 
multiple-choice phrases such as "Please furnish / I will furnish your 
uniforms," which employers like Sally Cooper and Kramer, who wouldn't think of 
demanding uniforms, find quaint. The bilingual commands are listed by job, such 
as "Living room: Wax and polish the piano, but do not wax the keys." 
</P>
<P>
"Me want juice," is the way Garr talks to Flores, and louder than necessary. 
Why? "I have to talk patchy or she won't understand." His words have the 
faintest, almost imperceptible, tone of resentment. 
</P>
<P>
Women like Kramer say they would like to talk more deeply to the women who work 
for them but they can't. "Most of my friends, like me, hired through word of 
mouth. We depend on the recommendations of each other's housekeepers who always 
have friends or sisters looking for work," she says. "Then, like I'm doing with 
Esperanza, we trust our own intuitions day by day. You don't have much choice, 
really, if you don't speak their language." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer concedes that she doesn't know much about what Flores does on her off 
hours. "I don't know what values she taught her own children, although I assume 
that because she is a nice person she lives by the same values we do." 
</P>
<P>
Talking it over one afternoon, the question of what impact Flores will have on 
the values and outlook of Marissa and Garr seems to concern her deeply. But 
finally, Kramer insists that the question doesn't matter. It is from the 
family, she says, that the children will learn the important principles of 
life. In this view -- and it is the dominant one -- the care giver falls into 
the same category as a costly board game or good book. "The nanny is there to 
enhance the environment of the child while the parent is gone, that's all," 
Kramer concludes. 
</P>
<P>
One morning when Kramer is gone, Flores sits at the dinette while Marissa 
orbits her like a little moon. 
</P>
<P>
"She speaks English fine," offers Marissa, anxious to join the conversation, 
which is going on in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"Que galan," says Flores. How nice that would be. They laugh together. 
</P>
<P>
At the refrigerator Flores offers fruit juice, which Marissa rejects. ("You 
know your mother doesn't want you to have the Fudgsicles until after lunch.") 
Flores sits again. Her head is framed by the white eyelet curtains on the 
window behind her, which gives onto the front walk, mauve and pink roses beyond 
the beveled glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I see the war here on television," she says. "It makes you want to 
be there now." Then she smiles at what she said. "As if you could protect your 
children anyway." 
</P>
<P>
If they could talk to each other, as both say they want to, Kramer and Flores 
might find that they have much in common -- from their trust in intuition to 
their worries about their children. They might also be able to come up with a 
plan to, well, handle Marissa, who is now removing a Fudgsicle from the freezer 
compartment herself. Brazenly, she sits at the table, slurping at the 
chocolate. Kramer has a frustrated mother's description of her daughter: 
"Affectionate, obstinate, belligerent and intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
"Some days it feels I just yell at her all day long," Kramer says. "I worry 
Esperanza might wonder, 'Why is this mother yelling?' And I have no way of 
saying to her, 'She drives me crazy.' Do you think she understands that?" 
</P>
<P>
Marissa has hit Flores to get her attention, but Flores won't report it; she is 
afraid of getting fired. While Kramer is crying out in her mind for someone to 
sympathize with her, to understand that Marissa is willful, Flores of all 
people knows it best, but keeps it a secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Not every parent understands that if one complains it doesn't mean one doesn't 
like her child," she says. In fact, she has seen that kind of misunderstanding 
arise and watched jobs evaporate for her friends. "Besides, when you do 
complain, the child can begin to think of you as the enemy." She tenderly dabs 
with a napkin at the chocolate tracks on Marissa's face as the girl climbs into 
her lap. There, lulled by the cadence of Flores' foreign speech, the child 
falls asleep. 
</P>
<P>
BY THE TIME MARISSA, Garr and little Michael Cooper are parents, the face of 
this region will look different than it does today. According to a 1988 Census 
Bureau report, since 1980 the Latino population of the United States has 
increased five times faster than that of any other group, reaching an estimated 
19.4 million. California counts the highest per-state Latino population -- 6.6 
million. One projection, by David Hayes-Bautista, director of the Chicano 
Studies Center at UCLA -- assuming an influx of immigrants from a troubled 
southern hemisphere and continued high fertility rates among the Latin 
population -- suggests that Latinos could make up as much as 45% of the state's 
population by 2030, outstripping Anglos, Asians and blacks. Already, in Los 
Angeles, Anglos make up less than half the population. About 60% of the 
half-million children in the city's public schools are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Parents like the Coopers and the Kramers not only are aware of this picture, 
but also say they want to help their children prepare for the new realities. 
They say they like having a Spanish-speaking care giver precisely because she 
might help their children become bilingual. "Learning Spanish at home would be 
so much easier for him than at school," Cooper says. "At this age the 
children's minds are sponges." 
</P>
<P>
Like other elements in this experiment, however, the hoped-for process of 
cultural exchange may have results that are neither uniform nor predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Even Anglo children who are surrounded by Latinos may develop strong ideas 
early about what language belongs to whom. Take Joshua, the 3 1/2-year-old son 
of Chris Delaney, an editor, and his art-director wife, Carol. Josh goes to a 
bilingual preschool, then comes home to his infant sister and an obviously 
beloved Guatemalan woman named Raquel -- Josh calls her Raki. One night Chris, 
who is teaching himself Spanish, sits on the bed with Josh for their bedtime 
reading. "Uno, dos, tres," Chris offers, counting apples on a page. Josh draws 
himself up sharply. "Don't talk that way," the boy says. "That Raki talk." 
</P>
<P>
Sally Cooper says she does not think Michael will grow up "thinking of Spanish 
as a second language, but meaning second class," even though the only person 
speaking Spanish to him works for Mom and Dad. "I hope not," she says. At the 
nursery school she has chosen, Michael won't hear Spanish or see Latino 
children. "Maybe a few Asian, but that's about it. It's pretty much kids like 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
In neighborhoods that have a broad mix of residents, public schools can become 
places where children of many backgrounds are thrown together and prejudices 
can break down early. But youngsters from homes like the ones in this story 
(arguably the kind of homes likely to produce a significant proportion of 
tomorrow's decision makers) are liable to be isolated from the realities of 
demographic change because they don't go to public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Kramer and her neighbor, Lori Tyler, who employs a Mexican nanny, both say they 
want their children to learn Spanish to be able to better understand the new 
California. Yet they send their children to private schools because they feel 
that "standards" have suffered at the local public school because it makes 
special efforts to accommodate bused-in Latino students with language and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
And no matter how close the children become to the women who take care of them, 
two-way sharing of values may be limited because the nannies are obviously 
servants. The children learn this lesson young. Michael Cooper observes day 
after day that his mother might sit down when Perez is in the room, but Perez 
doesn't sit down in front of his mother. He sees Perez take home old newspapers 
once a week and, with permission, other items the family would discard. One 
day, he claimed the dollars in play from his mother's pocket, then, 30 inches 
tall, marched over importantly to pay Perez her wages. 
</P>
<P>
John, Tyler's generally sweet and respectful 12-year-old, recently looked at 
his mother in frustration and disbelief when she told him to pick up his messy 
room. "Why?" he said. "We have a housekeeper." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's here to pick up after you," Tyler quickly told him, but in fact Latin 
women have been doing just that since he was a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
USC's Stoner speculates that the cultural meeting between Latina nannies and 
Anglo families may not generate deep mutual understanding. "There is no 
empirical evidence anywhere in history that any kind of cultural transmission 
in fact takes place in these situations." The nannies and their charges, Stoner 
says, probably will not come to share values just because they spend time 
together. "Think about Scarlett O'Hara," she muses. "She never lost her racism 
despite the love she had for her mammy." 
</P>
<P>
THE EMPLOYERS TEND TO call the women they hire "nannies" or "housekeepers," 
even when their main task is child care. Often the women who do the work sound 
less grand when they refer to themselves: Baby sitter is the word they 
routinely use, spoken in English in the midst of a Spanish conversation -- 
there is no precise Spanish equivalent. The other common word they use is 
muchacha, which means "girl" but connotes "servant." 
</P>
<P>
Lori Tyler would never call Dolores Garcia a "servant." This week she is urging 
her to get a driver's license. "I seem to have to be in three places at the 
same time all the time, which is really why I desperately need somebody who can 
drive," says Tyler, who recently gave up grammar school teaching to pursue a 
career in acting and producing. But it is also out of fear for Garcia. Tyler's 
worst nightmare: "Dolores is picked up by immigration police at a bus stop." 
</P>
<P>
The Tyler house is noisy today. In front of an oak vanity with an oval mirror, 
Garcia is singing "It's a Small World" in a heavy accent as she braids 
8-year-old Alexandra's honey-colored hair. Workmen shout, laying flagstones for 
a new patio, while others are digging a pool. John runs out the door with a 
friend. If it were a weekday, his mother would be chauffeuring him to one of 
his scheduled activities: soccer, tennis lessons, religious school, piano 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they realize that not everyone is as privileged as they are," Tyler 
says, sitting before glass doors overlooking a canyon. "It bothers me that they 
are surrounded by a lot of kids whose families are much more wealthy than we 
are. What they are seeing in their everyday lives is just not the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler wants her children to be bilingual and tells Garcia to speak to them in 
Spanish so they'll learn. But Garcia has her own agenda. "Someday I will go 
home and work in an artesania shop for tourists," she says. She will get the 
job, she hopes, on the strength of the English she learns here. "The children 
teach me." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers from Mexico take jobs in child care, but because they have been 
coming to work in the United States for at least 40 years, their networks are 
better established than those of the Central Americans, and they often can find 
better-paying work. Garcia would not suffer as some other immigrants might if 
she went home to Mexico, because she comes from a stable, lower-middle-class 
background. It is only by leaving, however, that she has been able to push the 
family ahead. At home she made about $60 a month as a grammar school teacher. 
Today, alone at 24, she is putting two younger brothers through school; she 
also "modernized" her parents' house. Yet Garcia doesn't dare tell her mother 
and father exactly how she makes her money. "Once I mentioned it to one of my 
sisters. I made her swear to keep it a secret that I was cleaning houses and 
taking care of children. 'Oh no!' she said." 
</P>
<P>
In Oaxaca, the southern state that Garcia is from, poor young Indian girls are 
sent from their villages to work in homes in the richer provincial capitals or 
Mexico City, and the racial and social stigma attached to the job there is real 
and deep. But Garcia has converted the same job here into a kind of finishing 
school that will set her apart from -- above -- her neighbors back home. "I'm 
doing all this on my own," she says, in a tone that speaks adventure. "I'm 
learning what it is to control my own life and go forward. I haven't made any 
big mistakes yet." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler hired Garcia last year "on intuition" for a $500 fee through a broker who 
advertises in a local newspaper, to replace a Nicaraguan woman who worked for 
the Tylers for four years, and a Salvadoran who worked two years before that. 
The presence of women from a vastly different world, Tyler hopes, is an object 
lesson for John and Alexandra. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely positive for my children to see how someone like Dolores has 
to leave her family to help them and send home her money instead of spending it 
on what she wants," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler would like John and Alexandra to grow up with compassion for the women 
who once changed their diapers and now care for them in other ways. She admits 
that the children don't know other Latinos socially and that neither does she, 
except for her own childhood nanny from Guadalajara, a woman she still 
affectionately calls her "second mother." Yet she also appears horrified at the 
thought of her children coming to identify Latinos as a servant class. 
</P>
<P>
She tries to fight the image, but her only weapons are words, and they do not 
seem enough. "When we've returned back from our trips to Spain or Mexico, I 
tell the children those countries are just like the United States, in that you 
have very rich people and very poor people and a middle class. I tell them 
there are all kinds of people there, just like there are all kinds of 
Americans. A lot of people in those countries have housekeepers, too." 
</P>
<P>
IF THE RELATIONSHIPS described here are marked by warmth, dependence and, 
sometimes, strain, they are also marked by change, which would become clear in 
subsequent weeks. In autumn, Sally Cooper was all smiles about Marta Perez, but 
by late fall, she seems impatient. Perez has been acting "strangely," she says, 
missing housecleaning jobs that Cooper set up with friends because Perez wanted 
the extra money. Perez doesn't call to cancel, which puts Cooper in a tough 
spot, and she seems distracted. "I think she came back to work too soon after 
her baby," Cooper says, sounding sympathetic and annoyed at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Dolores Garcia, who now has a boyfriend here and wants to 
extend her stay, has managed to qualify for legal papers by passing as a 
farmhand under the immigration law. "She paid someone $500 and has to go work 
in the fields near Santa Maria for 90 days," Lori Tyler says. "I don't know 
what we'll do without her, but she said she'll be back, and she'll be safer 
then." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Kramer leaves town for two days with her husband, visiting some property 
they own. While they are gone, Flores says she is in charge. What she doesn't 
know is that by January, Kramer will have demoted her to a visiting housekeeper 
and hired a Danish au pair, declaring that the language barrier frustrated and 
finally overwhelmed her. It was a fragile marriage, after all. 
</P>
<P>
One morning over the holidays, however, Marissa was clinging to Flores' legs 
affectionately, making it awkward for either one of them to walk, but neither 
seemed to care. Flores looked tired. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night I dreamed I went back to El Salvador and my children wouldn't pay 
any attention to me," she confides. "I woke up crying and went to sleep again 
just when it was getting light. Then I dreamed they died and no one could find 
me to tell me about it." 
</P>
<P>
From inside the TV room, hung with thick shades to shut out the light for 
daytime viewing, Garr calls out for "somebody!" to join him. He is watching a 
video in which a family, bundled in bright wool and watch caps, ski across the 
screen together, skimming snow so smooth and trackless it looks as if no one 
has ever been there before. 
</P>

PRIVATE LIVES: A MOVING EXPERIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SURE, PACKING UP IS PAINFUL. BUT IT'S THE RESETTLING THAT'S REALLY UNSETTLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE GREEN, Lee Green's last story for this magazine was His J.F.K. 
Obsession. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE WORST PART OF moving isn't moving. It's the aftermath -- all the 
institutional rigmarole you have to go through to reconnect with the planet. 
Gas, water, electricity, garbage, phone, newspapers, mail, cable -- it's enough 
to send Kafka screaming into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, I moved from Santa Paula to Ventura, 10 miles west. I made the usual 
renter deposits and concessions -- first, last, security, the rights to my next 
book and so forth -- and began the reconnect ritual with a call to the local 
cable TV company to order service. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to come to our office and fill out an application," the cable lady 
informed me. 
</P>
<P>
You can order a sarong from India or buy a piece of General Electric by phone, 
but for cable TV in Ventura, you have to appear in person. This is supposed to 
be the age of convenience. You should have to appear in person only for 
haircuts and heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
I shrewdly figured that I could save money by ordering my cable with Lou. He 
owns the house I rent and occupies the upper level. One address, one cable fee, 
right? Together, we entered the cable office as smug as debutantes. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, we were back on the street, Lou staring numbly at our 
receipts, trying to decipher a dizzying array of fees. Without subscribing to 
any premium services -- no Showtime, no HBO, no Cinemax -- we had surrendered 
$122.56. "Why do I feel like I've been raped?" Lou muttered. 
</P>
<P>
We hadn't fared well. "You both will need decoder boxes," the cable lady said. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is that?" Lou protested. "My TV is cable-ready. I used to get this same 
selection of channels in L.A. without a decoder box." 
</P>
<P>
"Every cable company is different," she said. "With us, you need the decoder. 
If you like, we can rent you a remote control for it." 
</P>
<P>
"My TV already has remote," Lou said. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't work with our decoder box. You'll have to rent a special remote from 
us." 
</P>
<P>
We walked out grateful that we didn't have to rent special televisions. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone company was more progressive. I was able to order phone service 
by phone. A few weeks later, someone from Pacific Bell called to inform me that 
I was using my phone too much: "In a six-day period, you made calls totaling 
$238.82." 
</P>
<P>
"What is this, a joke?" I replied. "How about if you just send me a bill every 
month, and I send you a check?" 
</P>
<P>
"If you continue to make toll calls at this rate," the Pac man intoned, "your 
monthly bill will be around $1,000." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, this was George Orwell calling from the ultimate area code. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a writer. . . . I work at home. . . . When I'm researching, I make a lot 
of calls," I explained. "I paid General Telephone so much money last year that 
their annual report listed me as a fixed asset." 
</P>
<P>
"I understand," the Pac man said, not without sympathy. "But I'm afraid this is 
our policy for new customers. We're going to send you a special bill for the 
$238.82. It's due in a week." 
</P>
<P>
A polite follow-up letter explained that Pacific Bell gets nervous when a new 
customer's phone charges exceed $150. Hit $400, and it gets nervous again. And 
every time it gets nervous, it sends a bill. This is on top of the monthly 
bill. Touch enough tones, and you could get four bills between new moons. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Service is another force movers must reckon with. For some 
reason, my mail wasn't finding its way to my new address, so I ambled on down 
to the post office to inquire why. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sad to report that the image of mail carriers completing their appointed 
rounds through sleet and snow and dark of night belongs to a bygone era. The 
problem, I was told by a supervisor, was our curb-side mailbox. Invariably, a 
car is parked in front of it, so the carrier, without bothering to notify us, 
was boycotting our house. "The carrier has to be able to approach the mailbox 
from directly in front of the box," the supervisor explained. "We don't want 
'em reaching in blind. Never know what sort of hazard might be in there." 
</P>
<P>
"How often do carriers encounter hazards in mailboxes?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor shrugged. "Not very often." 
</P>
<P>
My father, in his venerable wisdom, had a different view of the matter. "They 
just don't like having to get out of their trucks and walk 5 feet to the curb," 
he scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they're on to the notion that time is money," I offered. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell," my father groused, "why don't they just drive down the street without 
stopping at all? Just keep the mail in the truck. That would save a lot of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The disheartening aspect of all these movers' miseries is that they involve 
monopolies. If you don't like your local phone or cable company or your mail 
service, what are you going to do, threaten to take your business elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
It was with a liberating sense of control, then, that I attended to a banking 
matter. In dealing with a bank, I feel that I have at least a modicum of 
free-enterprise leverage. I strode purposefully into the branch of my bank 
closest to my new abode and approached a young man at a teller's window who was 
eager to be of service. 
</P>
<P>
"My account is at the branch on the other side of town," I explained. "But I've 
just moved to this neighborhood, so I'll be conducting my transactions at this 
office." 
</P>
<P>
"No problem!" 
</P>
<P>
"Would there be any advantage to actually moving my account to this office?" 
</P>
<P>
After a moment of serious contemplation, he replied, "Well, it's closer." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing in his tone or expression to indicate that he was trying for 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
I returned home to discover that the mail carrier, somehow managing to prevail 
against automotive impediments, had anointed my box with a solitary piece of 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
A bill from Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
I was moved.

Twentieth Century Fox is reportedly spending a fortune on its big summer pic, 
"The Abyss" -- and wants to distance itself fathoms from two other underwater 
adventures: Tri-Star's recently released "Deepstar Six" and MGM's "Leviathan," 
which surfaces in March. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, an "Abyss" teaser trailer was pulled from screens recently after only 
a two-week run -- a Fox rep confirms that studio brass were worried audiences 
might confuse "Abyss" with the other films. 
</P>
<P>
"But one of them is already out of the way," said the Fox spokesman, referring 
to "Deepstar," which went glub with only $7 million in ticket sales after three 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Fox folks insist that "Abyss" -- from the "Aliens" team of director James 
Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd -- is not a "monster movie" like the 
competing films but a "totally wondrous encounter with the unknown." Pat H.

'ACTION CUTS' THAT RESIST TOUSLING AND JOSTLING ARE THE NEW STYLES FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

AT 6 MONTHS OLD, England's wee Princess Beatrice, daughter of the Duke and 
Duchess of York, may be a bit too young to influence hair fashions, but her 
dapper little cousins, Prince William and Prince Harry, are already 
trend-setters. Their very traditional cuts have replaced last year's spiky-tyke 
styles as the look for kids in 1989. Instead of trying to look like wild-haired 
rock stars, many boys ages 4 to 12 are now getting cuts that are long in back, 
tapered only slightly at the nape and fairly long on top. The look is designed 
to keep the hair neat even when tousled. These "action cuts," as hairdresser 
Edward Jimenez calls them, fall right into place no matter how many tricks the 
kids do on their bikes. "It's not a military school look," says Jimenez, whose 
Sunset Boulevard salon caters to adults and children. "The length in back keeps 
it from looking too severe." 
</P>
<P>
For girls, action-worthy styles, such as English bowl cuts and classic 
ponytails, pigtails and French braids, are all the rage. As Sherman Oaks 
children's stylist Pam Pepper explains: "Kids still don't want to look 
different from other kids -- no matter what their parents think. But the kids 
all say they want to look cool at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Easy care is a high priority for the elementary school set. "Low- to 
no-maintenance" is how Tina Cassaday, a Beverly Hills children's hairdresser, 
describes the trend. Cassaday not only makes house calls to snip the tresses of 
Michael Landon and his kids, but she also does her son Justin's entire 
second-grade class at Beverly Vista school. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's 4-year-old daughter, Jennifer, "always worries that her bangs are too 
long," Cassaday says. Jennifer isn't alone. Most children dislike it when their 
hair gets in their eyes. "Bangs should never be long enough to be blinding," 
Jimenez says. "That's the No. 1 complaint from kids. Their mothers think long 
fringe is cute, but it drives the kids crazy." This year's favorite fringe is 
eyebrow-length in front, tapering longer at the temples,similar to the way that 
child actress Sarah Doroff wore her bangs in "Three Fugitives." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, kids were asking for vibrant colors in their hair, but those 
requests have dwindled. Now the only call for color is from young actors and 
actresses who need highlights or a change of shade for a role. At her salon, 
Peppermints, Pepper says she prefers not to apply chemical treatments, such as 
hair color or perms, to children under 10. "The hair hasn't developed 
completely until then, so I can't guarantee successful results. Besides, it's 
just not healthy for young hair." 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez adds that he has observed children as young as 5 years old with 
artificial highlights. "That's not the child's desire. That's the parent 
fulfilling some need," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Chemicals destroy the outer layers of the hair, making it weak and brittle, 
Cassaday says. If color is required, she chooses vegetable-based dyes that 
won't damage the hair shaft. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good that the young heirs to the British throne have not realized 
their impact on today's trends, but, as Cassaday says, "there just aren't that 
many children today who influence styles." 
</P>

Photo, COLOR, At the Peppermints salon in Sherman Oaks, Justin Barton, 7, shows 
off a bowl-type cut. Hairdresser Pam Pepper cuts the one-length style so it 
falls back in place. "Most boys Justin's age are into sports -- hockey, T-ball, 
soccer. They need a haircut that can handle the action." Catanzaro / Mahdessian

OUTTAKES: WILD ABOUT HARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He's tall, dark and handsome, plays a mean piano and sings the standards -- 
very well, according to critics. Jazzman Harry Connick Jr. -- who's only 21 -- 
is hot! 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: It was SRO during his recent four-week gig at the venerable Oak Room 
of NYC's Algonquin Hotel. He recently wowed David Letterman's audience with a 
bluesy New Orleans tune which segued into "Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll." The 
following day, reports a Connick rep, Letterman himself put in a call, to see 
if Connick could be a regular. Next Sunday, Connick hits NBC's late-night music 
fest, "Sunday Night." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there's a Connick piece in the current Newsweek and a "People" blurb 
in the latest Time. More coverage is due in GQ, Rolling Stone, Seventeen and 
Sassy. For Esquire, he'll be featured in a photo spread on influential New 
Yorkers in their bedrooms -- and Spin wants to include him in its upcoming 
bathing suit issue! 
</P>
<P>
So how's the piano man -- who's got two Columbia albums out -- responding to 
all this attention? 
</P>
<P>
"Ahhmm amazed -- and totally flattered," drawled Connick, adding modestly, "I 
guess my age, and the type of music I play, has a lot to do with all this." 
</P>
<P>
From New Orleans, where his dad is district attorney and his late mother was a 
judge, Connick's been playing piano publicly since age 6, professionally since 
he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
"New Orleans is kind of 'in' right now, ya know," mused Connick, who's single. 
"I don't have an ounce of Cajun blood in me, but I think people assume I eat 
possum for breakfast. Maybe that's why some folks are interested in me." 
</P>
<P>
Hitting the road, Connick's got gigs set in Japan and Europe. He'll do an L.A. 
stand at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill April 11-16. Pat H. Broeske

The upscale Videotheque stores in West Hollywood and Bev Hills get their share 
of free-spending video customers, from busloads of Japanese tourists to 
big-name Hollywood types. But none tops a 30-year-old Saudi Arabian prince from 
Riyadh, who recently faxed a routine order for 300 movies. Total cost, at 
$89.95 each: $27,000 (yes, we saw the invoice). 
</P>
<P>
"He likes anything in color, but tends to stay away from gory films," said 
Videotheque exec assistant Ria Snoek, who asked us not to name the prince. "No 
musicals, no subtitles, and nothing in black and white. And, of course, no 
pornography." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Meir Hed said he counts several Saudi royal personages among his regular 
customers, but this particular prince is the biggest spender: more than 
$600,000 on videotapes since 1981. Scott Busby

STAGE WEEK: WHAT'S STAGED AND READ ALL OVER? LATC

Get ready for another "Big Weekend," as the Los Angeles Theatre Center unveils 
its annual festival of new plays and staged readings Thursday through next 
Sunday. In addition to performances of its current shows -- "Demon Wine," "A 
Burning Beach" and "Three Ways Home" -- a NewWorks Project will feature 
readings of Marlane Meyer's "The Geography of Luck," Neal Bell's "Ready for the 
River," Cherrie Moraga's "Shadow of a Man" and Edward and Mildred Lewis' 
"Spring Street," a contemporary adaptation of Gorky's "Lower Depths." 
</P>
<P>
The Center's seven professional training labs will also be in evidence, 
presenting the best work developed in their groups over the past year; included 
are the Playwright's Unit, the Music Theatre Lab, the Women's Project, the 
Asian-American Theatre Project, the Black Theatre Artist's Workshop, the Latino 
Theatre Lab and the Young Playwright's Lab. On Saturday, a symposium, "State of 
the Art: Theatre in the 21st Century," will take place in Theatre 3.

SIGNING ON: A different kind of storytelling comes to town in "Flying Words 
Project," opening Friday at Friends and Artists Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is a performance art piece; it's like watching a play and a movie 
at the same time," said Kenny Lerner, who provides the "voice" for deaf 
poet-performer Peter Cook. "It's a play in that it's live theater. But it's a 
movie in that, using sign language, you can go anywhere in a split second. You 
can go to the moon or a cave, move in space and time, go in slow motion, do 
close-ups, far-away shots or pan over a scene -- and Peter will make you see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
To give one a visual sense of the possibilities, he said, "Hold your hands up 
on each side of your head. Wiggle your fingers. Your hands are trees now. Put 
the trees behind your ears and you can set up a kind of rhythm. Then you're 
moving through the woods. You can use your body to be a person or an animal. 
You can become part of the environment, or cut to something that's going on in 
the brush. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Lerner, who hooked up with Cook four years ago, when he was teaching at a deaf 
college in New York and Cook was performing solo, describes his part as "the 
connection for the hearing audience. I'm the background, the vocals, the sound 
track. Sometimes I narrate, sometimes I'm silent. I try to talk as little as 
possible, let people see what's happening by themselves. Sign language is like 
poetry -- and we try to express it on as many levels as we can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: Rupert Holmes' mystery joy ride "Accomplice" recently 
premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse, with Art Wolff directing Pamela Brull, 
Michael McKean, Natalia Nogulich and Harry Shearer. Without giving away any 
significant clues, here's what the local press had to say. 
</P>
<P>
From Dan Sullivan in The Times: "Up until its final scene, 'Accomplice' is the 
wittiest, most accomplished fooler since 'Deathtrap.' The last scene is false, 
but tolerant audiences will go along with it. . . . If Holmes is gunning for a 
classic, though, he'll either have to improve that scene or take it out." 
</P>
<P>
Others agreed. Said Kathleen O'Steen in Daily Variety: "What starts out as a 
classical thriller that properly twists and deviates its way through a 
handsomely staged first act is ultimately undone by a wild and unbelievable 
array of twists that unfold in Act II." 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. Reader, Ken Blais found "enough plot twists to confuse even the 
most clever sleuth. But thanks to a major thematic shift late in the second 
act, our attempt to sort out the plot becomes a gratuitous exercise. 
Nevertheless, the ensemble acting is first-rate." 
</P>
<P>
Said the Daily News' Tom Jacobs: "The fun of this kind of play lies in watching 
the plot twist and turn, trying to anticipate the next reversal and being 
delighted when you're caught off guard. This reviewer was delighted quite 
often, thank you. Fair to say, he was also disappointed from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Noted Steven Mikulan in the L.A. Weekly: "Holmes has set out to not only poke 
fun at this genre convention, but to create a parody that is constantly 
self-deconstructing well beyond the point of absurdity. It is a clever and fun 
attempt that runs on a bit too far past the point when it should end." 
</P>
<P>
And from Richard Stayton in the Herald Examiner: "Holmes never stoops to the 
camp excesses of Neil Simon's 'Murder by Death.' This is a series of shrewd 
mental pratfalls, aided immensely by designer David Jenkins' idiomatic English 
cottage, Kathleen Detoro's droll costumes, Martin Aronstein's telling lights 
and Jon Gottlieb's provocative sound effects."

COMING SOON: SNEAK PREVIEWS OF FORTHCOMING BOOKS OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS;

EARLY ENCROACHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EASTON , From Power &amp; Glory, a novel of old California by Robert 
Easton, to be published in April by Capra Press, Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Yes, here was a special place, as if set apart by Providence.' 
</P>
<P>
THREE HUNDRED MILES to the south of San Francisco, Senora Clara Boneu was 
sitting on the veranda of her hacienda, young Father O'Hara beside her, looking 
out over her garden with its pink and white hollyhocks and dark-red Spanish 
roses. "I welcomed the North Americans at first," she was saying bitterly, 
"just as you did. They seemed our liberators from Mexican oppression. But now 
this!" She pointed to the two white-hooded wagons of the newly arrived 
squatters standing side by side a mile down the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Her rough old voice was hardened by life, O'Hara thought, and her face reminded 
him of an ancient tree trunk, expressing acceptance and resistance in equal 
measure. The flaming red hair, almost as profuse as in youth, was held back 
from her face by a simple chaplet of seashells. She had not adopted Spanish or 
Mexican dress but wore the Mother Hubbard of a Christianized Indian woman. Yet 
her bearing said unmistakably she was the Senora, daughter of a legendary 
Indian chieftainess, widow of a famous conquistador. 
</P>
<P>
"We must endure with vigilance." O'Hara spoke with the frankness of long 
friendship. "The Norte Americano squatters have also occupied my orchard, 
tearing down fences for firewood. Yet there is a law. And on that we must rely. 
With God's help." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think much of a law which says I must establish my right to a place 
where I've lived all my life!" 
</P>
<P>
"I likewise must submit a claim to the Land Commission," he rejoined, "for soil 
hallowed by nearly a hundred years of devotion!" 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara's hair was nearly as red as Clara's. Son of a general in the Spanish 
Army who'd sent him from Madrid to a seminary in Dublin over the tearful 
objections of his Castilian mother, O'Hara had felt the call to California and 
had come marching in the footsteps of the missionary fathers, a one-man army, 
strong in faith that by sheer zeal he could resurrect from the ruins of Mission 
Santa Lucia what he conceived to be the greatness of a past -- which included 
Clara. It was his special pleasure once a month to ride out the 18 miles from 
town on his mule and say Mass for her and those of her people who chose to 
attend. Afterward, the gray-robed Franciscan liked to sit on the veranda and 
talk as now. Changing to a more pleasant subject, he observed: "I never tire of 
looking at this scene," gesturing toward the valley below. 
</P>
<P>
On the playing field, Indian youths from the village were engaged in a 
ball-and-stick game resembling modern hockey. On the course nearer the river 
still others from the village and from Clara's household, and even visitors 
from town, were preparing a horse race. And at the village itself, a cluster of 
adobe cabins and thatched huts beside the stream that she maintained there in 
the ancient way, they could see groups of women rolling dice into basketry 
trays and girls playing the guessing game, as she'd once played it. Beyond the 
river, grassy hills rose steeply, speckled with grazing cattle, culminating in 
that high-rounded hill where her husband, Antonio, lay buried. She and he had 
dreamed of a scene like this. All that marred it for her and O'Hara were those 
wagons down the valley. He asked: "You've talked to them?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. They refuse to budge. Someone has told them my title is in doubt until 
the Land Commission rules." 
</P>
<P>
On the race course below, two youths -- one, Clara's grandson, Pacifico, tall, 
blond; one short and dark, Benito Ferrer, son of the Jewish storekeeper in the 
town -- were racing their horses, a gray and a bay, neck and neck, while cheers 
urged them on. The youngsters finished in a dead heat and glanced for approval 
toward the veranda. Clara raised her right hand and waved. O'Hara did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, here was a special place, this Rancho Olomosoug, as if set apart by 
Providence. In all California there could be nothing quite like it. O'Hara 
prayed silently that greed, prejudice, the hatred, the violence that were 
defiling so much of the state would spare this peaceful scene. But reason told 
him that his prayer was probably too late. 
</P>
<P>
Down in the valley, old Abe Jenkins, leathery, irrepressible, stood at the prow 
of his wagon like the captain of a ship, observing them through a brass 
spyglass. "The Papist is a-settin' there a-gabbin' to her," he announced to his 
family. "They're a-figurin' what to do about us, I reckon. Ha!" 
</P>
<P>
Clara continued quietly to O'Hara: "There must be no bloodshed. The soil of 
this valley is soaked in blood, Indian blood, white blood. There has been 
enough. That's what I told that old galoot Jenkins that day he arrived."

DONIZETTI: "ANNA BOLENA." Joan Sutherland, Susanne Mentzer, Jerry Hadley, 
Samuel Ramey; Chorus and Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard 
Bonynge. London 421-096-2 (three compact discs). Sutherland is a fit tragic 
heroine for Donizetti's inventive dip into bel-canto Elizabethiana. The 
Australian soprano still commands an authority that few of her contemporaries 
can match -- the extended finale before the beheading is still worth waiting 
for -- but the occasional underpitch note and unraveled phrase suggests this 
project should have been done a decade ago. Sutherland's unfailingly youthful 
colleagues underline her current vocal estate. American mezzo Mentzer brings 
fresh tone and a persistent vibrato to Jane Seymour. Hadley proclaims Percy's 
ardent sentiments with cultivated tenorial fervor. Ramey is an orotund and 
sympathetic Henry VIII. Bonynge accommodates them all, without imposing much 
personality on the project. Allan Ulrich

NOTEBOOK: SPLITTING A TAB -- LET ME COUNT THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brad Altman of Los Angeles asks me to discuss check-splitting protocol. To 
celebrate a promotion, he writes, he and four office colleagues had lunch one 
day recently at Musso &amp; Frank's in Hollywood. When the $88 bill arrived, 
the group gave the waiter four credit cards and asked to have it split four 
ways. At first, the waiter refused; after a discussion with his superiors, 
though, he did split. 
</P>
<P>
"From a customer's perspective," Altman concludes, "a four-way split was at 
worst a minor . . . imposition on the restaurant cashier, who had to imprint 
and fill out four credit cards instead of one or two." Was he being 
unreasonable to ask for such a split? he asks. 
</P>
<P>
For my money, yes. A two-way split is one thing -- and perhaps it might be 
argued that, in a large group with a large sum of money involved, four ways 
might be acceptable. But splitting an $88 check in four sounds plain petty to 
me. Don't any of these guys carry $25 or so in spendable cash? Can't at least 
one or two of them handle the math that would be involved in working out a 
split among themselves? And the imposition on the cashier is not a minor one. 
Not only must four credit-card blanks be run, but four credit cards have to be 
checked for validity (a process that sometimes takes a couple of minutes per 
card, especially at peak hours) and then filled out. 
</P>
<P>
Different restaurants obviously have different rules about such things -- but 
I'll tell you one thing: If I had a restaurant, I sure wouldn't split $88 
checks four ways myself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RUMOR CONTROL: Mauro Vincente, proprietor of Rex II Ristorante downtown, Pazzia 
on La Cienega, and Fennel in Santa Monica, called the other day to say that he 
felt like shooting somebody. Word had reached him that a local radio broadcast 
had announced that Rex had closed. This is absolute nonsense, fumed Vincente. 
Though admittedly no longer doing turn-away business as it sometimes did in its 
first, hot months, Rex is thriving, he says. A new chef, Gennaro Villella, has 
been installed, he pays all his bills on time, he has a number of large-scale 
private parties booked, and he is doing quite well, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
Another restaurateur who feels like reaching for his pistol sometimes in Jean 
Leon. He says that he hears almost daily from one source or another that his 
venerable La Scala in Beverly Hills is going out of business. Again, nonsense. 
But because his lease is running out and rents have jumped extraordinarily for 
the premises he occupies, he will move both La Scala and the adjacent La Scala 
Boutique to a new location, also in Beverly Hills, sometime after the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WAITER, I'VE DROPPED MY HAND: The next time you sit down at a restaurant table 
and discover that you're missing one or more pieces of silverware, you might 
stop to think that at some tables, you wouldn't get any silverware at all. 
According to a study based on figures abstracted from various 1980 world census 
reports published recently in the Cooks Magazine, while some 1.5 billion people 
eat with a knife, fork, and spoon worldwide, another 1.2 billion eat with

It's great that clubs such as Florentine Gardens attract an interracial crowd. 
But if you're not beautiful, a great dancer or wearing the latest clothes, 
forget it. These are showing-off places, and the people they attract are vapid, 
air-headed trendies.

Don Snowden's article on ethnic radio failed to mention KPCC, FM 89.3. Among 
our ethnic broadcasts are the "Sancho" show, which celebrates Los Angeles' 
Mexican heritage; "Rhythm &amp; Blues Times Capsule" and "Rhapsody in Black," 
which chronicle black music; "Echoes of Greece," "Polish/American Show," 
"German/American Show," "European Music Box," "Asian Hour" and "Ebony '89."

As a member of the National Task Force on Presenting &amp; Touring the 
Performing Arts, I can say the issues raised in "The Big Mix" (Feb. 5) are the 
cultural issues being discussed in think tanks across North America. I would 
add, however, it is important to go beyond ethnicity to acknowledge the art of 
lesbians, gays, the elderly, the homeless.

I believe we all want the various ethnic groups of the Los Angeles area to 
nurture, support and thus perpetuate their roots. 
</P>
<P>
But then: Assuming all of the minorities develop their own museums, theaters, 
etc., will they join the soon-to-be-minority white upper and middle classes in 
filling the seats at the Music Center and elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Will the existence of Disney Hall and the Dance Gallery be justified? Will MOCA 
and LACMA continue to be successful? Interesting thought, yes?

We recognize the complaints against cultural institutions, which sometimes 
frustrate rather than encourage working artists ("A Theater of Cultural 
Diversity?" by Victor Valle). But our experience with Plaza de la Raza has been 
positive. As an emerging comedy troupe, we asked for Plaza's support; it found 
merit in our work and gave us access to their fine rehearsal facilities.

ROSENSCHALE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hapsburg Empire went down in World War I in a blaze of glory: Mahler and 
Strauss still dominate the late-romantic symphonic repertoire, Freud looms 
large in psychiatry, and Josef Hoffmann epitomizes fin de siecle design. 
</P>
<P>
In 1897, the Moravian-born architect, then 27 years old, helped found the 
Wiener Sezession to provide an alternative for designers and artists 
disenchanted with the moribund, state-run Kunstlerhaus. Sezession philosophy 
ran counter to the (still) prevalent notion that the decorative arts were 
inferior to "fine" arts such as painting and sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
As the first issue of the house organ, Ver Sacrum, put it: "We recognize no 
distinction between 'high art' and 'minor art'; between art for the rich and 
art for the poor. Art is everyone's property." Never mind that things didn't 
quite work out that way: The Sezession members' rejection of machine production 
ensured that their products would be too costly for the working class. 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, inspired by a trip to C. R. Ashbee's London Guild of 
Handicraft, a large workshop producing beautifully crafted art objects, 
Hoffmann and artist Kolomon Moser established the Wiener Werkstatte. 
</P>
<P>
By 1905, Wiener Werkstatte was the center of progressive design in Vienna, 
boasting more than 100 workers making metalwork, jewelry, leather work and 
furniture, mostly to Hoffmann's designs. But the Wiener Werkstatte went 
bankrupt in 1932 and was sneered at during the modernist, anti-ornament '50s 
and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In fashion, what goes around comes around, and today the Wiener Werkstatte's 
stock stands higher than ever (as the Museum of Modern Art's blockbuster 
"Vienna 1900" show of 1986 proved). Indeed, were Hoffmann alive, he would be a 
rich man from royalties on the dozens of revivals of his designs. They all have 
interesting stories. But none rival that of the Rosenschale Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann's long-lost bowl was "resurrected" recently for production by Italian 
manufacturer Alessi by Arnell/Bickford Associates, the trendy Manhattan 
advertising agency known mostly for offbeat "soft-sell" advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoffmann project began when Peter Arnell chanced on a photograph of the 
1906 bowl. "Only the prototype existed, and it never entered production; not 
even a drawing or sketch remained," he says. But the prototype sufficed for 
computer whiz David Teters and his Harris 500 computer to make production 
sketches. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it's the first critical reconstruction of a historical object," 
says Arnell, who dubbed the piece in honor of its repeating rose motif, also 
the Wiener Werkstatte's logo. The electroplated brass bowl (about $200) blends 
art and technology in the best Wiener Werkstatte tradition. Hoffmann, one 
feels, would have approved of the posthumous partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosenschale Bowl is available at all Neiman Marcus stores, and at Lynne 
Deutch Limited in Los Angeles.

BATIK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANYONE WHO LIVED through the '60s probably had a batik bedspread, wall hanging 
or caftan. Like tie-dying and love beads, it was an art uniquely associated 
with those free-spirited days. But then, like so many of the skills of that 
crafts revolution, batik languished, only recently enjoying a small renaissance 
among serious fiber artists. 
</P>
<P>
Batik is an ancient art, going back to Egypt, Persia, China, Japan and India, 
but it reached its full potential on the small island of Java. Since the 10th 
Century, Javanese batik has been the art of kings and then commoners, and 
special patterns were developed to cover most important occasions, such as 
weddings. One design is believed to have curative powers; another is used to 
wrap a newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Javanese patterns are exquisite and complicated repetitive designs, an 
ideal to which most of us can only aspire. On a more practical, at-home level, 
batik is quite simple, requiring only paraffin or beeswax, fabric and dye. 
Paraffin and dye are available at supermarkets, and any natural-fiber fabric 
will do (polyesters do not take dyes, but some nylons and ramies do; if there 
is any doubt about fiber content, dye a small sample before embarking on a 
major project). Simply make designs on the fabric, using objects dipped in wax 
(such as tin cans, needles or brushes); the wax will remain on the fabric. An 
even simpler method is to dribble wax onto the fabric. Once the wax design is 
complete, the fabric is dyed -- but those waxed areas will not be colored. This 
is called a "resist" technique because the waxed portions resist or repel the 
dye. When the fabric is dry, the wax is removed, usually by running a hot dry 
iron over a piece of paper placed over the fabric. More advanced practitioners 
will wax and dye the fabric several times, ending with a multicolored 
extravaganza that might even get a second look in Java. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplies can be found at most art stores, at Aaron Bros. throughout Southern 
California and Kit Kraft in Studio City. Most libraries carry books (usually 
from the '70s) on batik.

</P>

THE MOST ENDURING and pervasive architectural tradition of California, 
particularly Southern California, is the Hispanic, its roots having started 
about 200 years ago in the mission churches that marked the region's 
settlement. Fashioned by untrained priests and built by unskilled laborers, the 
missions combine the classical and churrigueresque-styled ecclesiastical 
designs of an idealized Mexican and Spanish motherland, albeit in available 
materials. Capturing the idealized spirit of the 21 missions built between 1770 
and 1850 is this attractively designed guide, with light histories of each by 
Stanley Young, and resplendent, studied color photographs by Melba Levick. 
There also is a brief foreword, by architectural historian Sally B. Woodbridge, 
that touches upon the romantic image and influence of the missions. ($14.95)

ARAFAT'S TRIALS AT TUNIS: ENEMIES INSIDE AND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tad Szulc, Veteran foreign correspondent Tad Szulc met with Yasser Arafat in 
late January. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TUNIS, TUNISIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 40 years ago, Jerusalem-born Yasser Arafat was an 18-year-old 
university student in Cairo fighting alongside Egyptian nationalists for 
independence from Britain. Next door, in his native Palestine, Jews were 
battling the British for the right to their sovereign homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Now the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization talks about the 
urgency of a peaceful settlement between Israelis and Palestinians over 
disputed territories on the West Bank and in Gaza. After settlement, he says, 
Israeli-Palestinian hatreds and bitterness will quickly vanish "and we shall 
live in peace." Arafat envisions the state of Israel and a state of Palestine 
living side by side in coexistence, neither nation "being superior to the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat was reminiscing about his youth at an informal dinner during three days 
of wide-ranging conversations a few weeks ago. He used the example of two 
simultaneous struggles for independence in the Middle East to underline the 
common history of Jews, Arabs and their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
While peace is still little more than a hope -- as unpredictable as all else in 
the embattled Middle East -- Arafat's own future hinges on current 
developments. A failure for the 59-year-old chairman's peace offensive or a 
breakdown in newly established dialogues with the United States could quite 
conceivably cost Arafat his leadership position -- if not his life. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations in Tunis with Arafat and other PLO figures illuminated the 
fragile control he maintains of the Palestinian movement. While Arafat has held 
PLO chairmanship for nearly 20 years (the organization was created in 1964), 
his leadership is constantly open to challenge, even life-threatening 
challenge, from the many factions of this fractious movement. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, five members of the 10-man Fatah Central Committee have been 
assassinated, most probably by fellow Arabs, and Arafat recognizes his personal 
vulnerability. Fatah was a group he founded in 1959. Along with the factions 
inside the PLO, he also has to contend with outside Palestinian terrorists who 
are his sworn enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Arafat promotes diplomacy, he lives under intense security. His 
constant travels -- flying aboard private jets to world capitals -- are kept 
secret until the moment of departure from all but a handful of most-trusted 
aides. The chairman's local whereabouts and movements are hidden from public 
sight, under armed guard. The PLO moved to Tunis in 1982 after expulsion from 
Beirut and now is virtually a state within a state. After the Israeli air 
strike at PLO headquarters in Tunis four years ago, installations have been 
changed and dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
While most PLO offices are located at dozens of villas in the suburban, 
middle-class district of El Menzah, the houses are unmarked and only key aides 
know the exact address of such operations as the Foreign Affairs Department, 
the Political Department or the Office of the Chairman. Inside, men in civilian 
clothes carry automatic weapons to protect the properties and their occupants. 
</P>
<P>
PLO activists in Tunis avoid the ostentatious presence they once displayed in 
Beirut. A casual tourist would not be aware that the PLO represents a major 
contribution to the shaky Tunisian economy -- the Palestinians have made 
themselves nearly invisible. A modern inn in downtown Tunis is commonly known 
as the "PLO hotel" because it serves the rapidly growing stream of foreign 
visitors calling on Arafat. PLO delegates and operatives are stationed in 109 
countries; they commute frequently between their posts and Tunis headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat himself lives on the outskirts of the capital where the PLO maintains 
what he calls "guest residences"; the chairman is said to sleep in a different 
house every night. As a rule, he receives distinguished foreign guests at the 
luxurious seaside residence of the PLO ambassador to Tunisia, hidden from the 
roadside. The driveway behind the trees is filled with cars and armed 
bodyguards in civilian clothes. These are men fanatically loyal to Arafat; they 
call him by his guerrilla code name, Abu Ammar. Abu means brother and Arafat, 
in English, refers to all his companions as "brothers." 
</P>
<P>
The Israelis, in his words, are also relatives. When asked whether Palestinians 
and Israelis could finally overcome the memory of wars and recriminations in 
the last four decades, Arafat said, "Don't forget that they are our cousins, 
and that 
</P>
<P>
this is all a part of our history . . . . You see, this is the Holy Land. We 
are encouraging the Israelis to talk with us and it is we who are running after 
them to have open talks." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat remembered when he had hidden from them. His associates said he rarely 
talked about his early years but this time Arafat was the one who brought up 
the subject. He launched into the story of his clandestine operations in Israel 
after the 1967 War. As the head of Fatah, he decided to organize underground 
resistance. He spent three months inside Israel in 1967 and one month in 1968, 
the first times he had been back since Israel won independence in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he wore a variety of disguises, sometimes dressing as a Bedouin 
tribesman, sometimes as a woman. He communicated in Arabic and in English, 
knowing enough Hebrew to move with considerable ease, not arousing suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
In those days, Arafat believed international terrorism and guerrilla warfare 
were the only viable weapons in the Palestinian struggle. Subsequently, he 
said, he decided that terror was the wrong policy. His new strategy is a 
combination of the intifada, the uprising in the territories occupied by Israel 
after the 1967 War, and a diplomatic peace offensive. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada, now 14 months old, is turning into a full-fledged thawra -- Arab 
for revolution. Arafat sees nothing but catastrophic bloodshed if events are 
allowed to escalate. That is why he turned to the outside world for support in 
his diplomatic initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
To enlist outside support, Arafat has worked to make the PLO look like a 
unified, responsible quasi-government, whatever its internal disputes. Fatah is 
probably the most important group under the PLO umbrella and the most loyal to 
him personally. But there are only three Fatah members on the 15-man PLO 
Executive Committee, in effect the ruling body. And a visitor cannot measure 
Arafat's control over the 450-member Palestine National Council that functions 
as a parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Both the executive committee and the national council supported Arafat's 
decision last December to recognize Israel and to renounce terrorism -- the 
conditions for opening diplomatic contacts with the United States. But it is no 
secret in Tunis that many PLO chieftains were privately opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's most notable opponent is Dr. George Habash, the 63-year-old founder of 
the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. He has abstained 
from public criticism since December, but Arafat's faction expects Habash to 
try sabotaging the new PLO policy. Habash believes armed struggle is the only 
way to deal with Israel; Arafat people assume that PFLP commandos were 
responsible for recent attempts to penetrate Israeli borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Arafat group thinks radical opponents are determined to make the chairman 
appear responsible for such attacks. That could force the U.S. Administration 
to break off dialogue on grounds that the PLO had not truly renounced 
terrorism. Rupture of the tie to Washington could strip Arafat of his new-found 
status and, inevitably, lead to his political collapse. The conversations in 
Tunis made clear that PLO politics are a perpetual-motion machine of intrigue 
and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Most current PLO leaders are middle-aged professionals. Arafat himself 
graduated in engineering from Cairo University in 1956. His younger brother 
Fathy is a physician and head of the PLO's Red Crescent Society. The PLO 
delegate to Sweden is an oral surgeon. Many other leaders are graduates of the 
American University in Beirut; they go out of their way to tell U.S. visitors 
about their backgrounds and their interests in America. Many also have close 
relatives in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat acts these days as a chief of state, paying visits to world figures 
ranging from Pope John Paul II to European prime ministers and receiving 
foreign ministers from everywhere. He has access to telecommunications 
technology and keeps contact with PLO outposts by fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
He also keeps tabs on the men considered dangerous enemies, leading terrorists 
such as Abu Nidal who broke away from the mainstream PLO and is now believed 
linked with Libya. 
</P>
<P>
When the cruise ship Achille Lauro was hijacked in 1985 by a group led by Abul 
Abbas, an American passenger was murdered; Arafat exploded. "He was tearing 
hair from his bald head, shouting that Abbas was destroying the Palestinian 
reputation with such acts," one associate said. 
</P>
<P>
Having embraced new strategy, Arafat knows he may be the target of the terror 
he once helped to spawn. "But I have no choice," he said, spreading his hands, 
a gesture of determined resignation: "This is the only way for us to go."

A MOSCOW BOY GOES BACK TO VISIT THE OLD FRIENDS AND FRIED STURGEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Goldberg, Paul Goldberg, author of The Final Act (Morrow), a history of 
the Moscow Helsinki Watch group, is working on a book about Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walking past the National Hotel as a Moscow boy, I wondered what it would be 
like to see my country as a Western outsider, staying at a fine hotel, being 
chauffeured around in Volgas, eating sturgeon and caviar, buying chic clothes 
at the foreign currency store and, after a week or two of pure joy, going back 
to the West. 
</P>
<P>
When I turned 14, my parents and I emigrated. Last fall, as an American 
citizen, I returned to Moscow to look up my friends, most of whom had not heard 
from me in 15 years. I wanted to see the look on their faces as Pavel Goldberg 
from America appeared at the doorstep unannounced. I also wanted to see my 
hometown as a foreigner and to demonstrate to my wife, an American, that my 
stories are deeply rooted in reality. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sheremetyevo Airport we got into a Volga and headed for the National. It 
is not a posh hotel. The carpet runner lay crooked in the hallway, walls were 
unevenly spackled, beds were coffin-like, long and narrow. There were two 
television sets, neither of which worked. Dish towels served as bath towels and 
the toilet ran. In New York a room like that would go for about $75 a night. In 
Moscow, $140. 
</P>
<P>
On Gorky Street, stucco was falling off the Stalin-era buildings. Cement was 
chipping off the movie theater Rossiya. Chunks were falling off the statues 
that surround the Socialist Realism skyscraper at Krasnaya Presnya. To protect 
pedestrians, the statues were covered with nets. 
</P>
<P>
At the zoo, the bird house, the aquarium and the terrarium were gone. The bear 
and tiger "grotto" had overgrown with tall grass. There was no wolf, no panda, 
no Ussuri tiger. Two woolly Caucasus sheep dogs sat on the far side of the moat 
looking dignified, as dogs do even in ridiculous situations. 
</P>
<P>
Then we went to see Sasha, a childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
As children, Sasha and I were fascinated by foreign cars and politics. In 1968, 
when we were both nine, Sasha told me that Brezhnev had to be a fool and a 
bully to invade Czechoslovakia. I agreed, noting that a genius wouldn't become 
a general secretary. Our political analyses were never impressive; our 
conclusions were. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Sasha and I went to the U.S. Embassy to look at cars. Ford Country 
Squires captured our imaginations more than any other model. The car seated 
seven, and if its speedometer was correct, it could do more than 100 miles an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
Within five minutes the adult Sasha and I were talking as if I had gone on a 
month-long vacation, returning with some big-ticket items I didn't own before. 
Like a house on Capitol Hill and a bright red 1987 Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
"Convertible?" Sasha asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No, a GTI with a sunroof." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, a beefed-up Golf." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically. Just more power." 
</P>
<P>
My old friends spent hours discussing their fear of narod, the people. In fact, 
narod now seems to scare them more than the government used to. 
</P>
<P>
There was a prevalent fear of the simple folk taking pitchforks and torches, 
shouting, "Death to the infidels!" 
</P>
<P>
The Jews said they expected to be the targets. The intelligentsia expected to 
be targets, too. So did my friends who joined the party. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one claimed to know much about "the people." Their impressions of 
public sentiment seemed based entirely on quotations from local drunks, people 
standing in queues at the GUM department store or Tatar street sweepers. 
</P>
<P>
My Moscow friends are surgeons, lawyers, economists, diplomats, engineers. One 
runs a cooperative employing 30 workers; every six months he fires 10 for 
laziness or incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
Those of my friends who joined the party were apologetic. "I really haven't 
changed," one assured me. "I still do not rule out emigrating." To prove that 
he was not "one of them," he launched into a nicely structured tirade on 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's errors and lack of sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone had a friend or a relative in the West. A scientist said that he has 
friends in every state on both coasts of North America. 
</P>
<P>
At one gathering I was asked how much our trip cost. I said that it would be a 
little over $6,000, but it would be tax-deductible since I am gathering 
material for my next book. I went on to explain tax deductibility but was told 
not to bother. Everyone knew. 
</P>
<P>
My Moscow friends are yuppies without Alfas and condos. My businessman friend 
owns a VCR he purchased for 4,000 rubles, about 20 times the average monthly 
salary. Another friend already has a VCR, but for the past couple of years he 
has dreamed about acquiring a Krups coffee maker and a pair of L.A. Gear 
running shoes. Luckily, our shoe size was the same and the hard-currency store 
carried Krups. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we live for," one friend explained. "It's an escape from the rude 
waiters, long lines and the bastards at work." 
</P>
<P>
Sasha's favorite book, and mine, is Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita." This 
established, we got into Sasha's car and headed for the Cafe Margarita, a 
cooperative by the Patriarch's Ponds, the place where Bulgakov's devil descends 
on Moscow, starting the magnificent story that captures the spirit of the city 
at the onset of Stalinism. 
</P>
<P>
A chair blocked the entrance. We positioned ourselves at the doorway and spoke 
English loudly, counting on the Russians' legendary subservience to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Half the tables in the cafe stood vacant. Shady-looking characters lounged at 
other tables. No one paid attention to us. 
</P>
<P>
"Excuse me," I said finally in Russian. "Are you open?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sanitarni chas," said a voice from Cafe Margarita -- sanitary hour. Sanitary 
hour is usually devoted to scrubbing floors and killing mice and roaches in the 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
The Peking restaurant on the Mayakovsky Square was closed for dinner; it was 
dinner time. The Sofia was catering weddings. The Japanese restaurant at the 
hotel and shopping mall developed by Armand Hammer was closed. The Russian 
Restaurant at the same place was doing only "special service." Two other 
restaurants were closed because the waiters were having dinner. The only place 
that would have us was Sadko, serving heavily breaded sturgeon, pan-fried, then 
pan-fried again, with eggs. 
</P>
<P>
We drank some cognac and Sasha told me that at one point he wanted to become an 
architect, then decided that his country has no use for elegance. He became an 
engineer. He liked engineering, but hoped to make a movie some day. 
</P>
<P>
"So, Sasha, how come you haven't sold yourself?" I asked 
</P>
<P>
"It's the upbringing," Sasha said. It seemed that in the past 15 years 
preservation of self-esteem was Sasha's chief obsession. He had been approached 
by the party -- offered substantial payoffs for little compromises. 
</P>
<P>
He always refused, telling himself that it never stops at one concession. "You 
say, 'Glory to the Communist Party!' at some silly meeting, then you join their 
glorious Communist Party because it's good for your career and because you need 
money, then you feel like a pig because now they own you, then you drink 
heavily to feel less like a pig, but feel more like one instead." 
</P>
<P>
The apartment where I was born was being renovated as headquarters for a 
cooperative that services medical equipment. "PLEASE DON'T HESITATE CALL TO 
US," said an advertisement in English. 
</P>
<P>
The courtyard where I played as a child had been dug up. An overflowing 
dumpster dominated the landscape. Construction rubble and unopened bags of 
cement lay on both sides. My wife, Kirsten, took some pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't photograph here, it's a military installation," said an old man I 
couldn't recognize. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right, I can see the missiles," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's right, missiles." He wanted to know why foreigners were taking 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you lived here long?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"About 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
"Then you might remember me. I am Pavel Goldberg from apartment 40." 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you live now?" 
</P>
<P>
"In Washington." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you happy?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"And the family?" 
</P>
<P>
"They are happy, too." 
</P>
<P>
"That's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
"Shall I tell them you said hello?" I wanted to know the old man's name. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell them you saw Ivan Stepanych who used to work for the organs of State 
Security. Tell them I am still alive." 
</P>
<P>
A woman in her mid-20s sat by a school, watching her toddler play with a German 
shepherd. I asked her if she knew what had happened to the mangled street 
before us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone," she said. "Even the bread store. There was always something tasty 
there. Now they've dug a hole, brought over a construction trailer, put up a 
concrete fence and built themselves a sauna." 
</P>
<P>
We stood looking at the mysterious construction site, watching soldiers go in 
and out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could leave," the woman said. "I'd go anywhere."

BLACK, WHITE, BROWN AND ATWATER;

STATIC ON THE PARTY LINES

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new chairman of the Republican Party is a Southern white. Earlier this 
month, the Democrats chose a black man who grew up in Harlem to be national 
chairman. The racial polarization of U.S. politics appears complete. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one thing: Both party chairmen have expressed a determination not to 
exploit racial tensions. "I promise you, my chairmanship will not be about 
race," Ronald H. Brown told the Democratic National Committee after he was 
elected. "It will be about the races we win." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Atwater, the new GOP chairman, started a "minority outreach" program for 
black voters. "Affirmative action has worked, and there's now a much larger 
black middle class," Atwater said. "The time is right for us to reach out to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Brown is a good example of the black voter Atwater is trying to reach. 
Brown rose to power in the white world. He came from the black middle class and 
went to elite, predominantly white schools. In Washington, Brown worked as a 
high-level aide for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). He became an influential 
Democratic Party operative and, eventually, a powerful lawyer and lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater assumes the GOP can appeal to successful blacks like Brown through 
economic interest. He may discover that most have a keenly developed sense of 
racial interest. A study by the University of Chicago reveals that successful 
young blacks still have difficulty finding housing in predominantly white 
suburbs. That is a racial problem, not an economic one. 
</P>
<P>
What will Brown's selection as chairman mean for the Democratic Party? If you 
believe, as many do, that Jesse Jackson represents the Democrats' biggest 
problem, then Brown is in a good position to deal with it. Having served as 
Jackson's convention manager in 1988, Brown has his support and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if you assume, as many do, that the Democrats can never win the 
presidency if they put Jackson on the ticket, then Brown's election allows the 
Jackson movement to claim a tangible success. Of course Jackson is one of the 
most controversial figures in U.S. politics, and some of that will rub off on 
Brown. Jewish voters -- and contributors -- have problems with Jackson, but so 
far they don't seem to have any with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown joined the Jackson campaign late and is not known to share Jackson's 
views on Israel or on black-Jewish relations. Brown is more closely identified 
with Kennedy and organized labor -- associations that do not bother most Jews. 
But they do not help among white Southerners. It can be argued that U.S. 
politics has become dominated by race. In the last three presidential 
elections, black voters went 9-1 for the Democratic ticket while the Democrats 
failed to win more than 40% of the white vote. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, both parties have an incentive to resist "the racial 
temptation." For the Democrats, it is a matter of survival. As Brown said, 
"America happens to be a majority white country." Republicans risk offending a 
large proportion of their base -- educated upper-middle-class voters who like 
GOP fiscal conservatism -- if the party's image becomes overtly racist. 
</P>
<P>
Does racial politics work? That is the political question of 1989. Race will be 
the principal issue in mayoral contests in the nation's three largest cities 
and an important Southern gubernatorial election. It is also the main problem 
facing both parties' leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The first and most dramatic test comes in Chicago, where racial politics is a 
tradition. The Feb. 28 Democratic primary pits a black incumbent, Acting Mayor 
Eugene Sawyer, against Richard M. Daley, son of the legendary "Boss" Richard J. 
Daley who ruled City Hall for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's first black mayor, the late Harold Washington, was elected in 1983 
because of a split in the white vote. Now, Daley is favored to win because of a 
split in the black vote. Many black activists were outraged when Sawyer, an 
organization Democrat, was chosen mayor through the support of white aldermen. 
Chicago's "movement" blacks are backing Timothy C. Evans, a black alderman who 
will run as the candidate of the "Harold Washington Party" in the April 4 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
"In Chicago elections," a political consultant once said, "the only real issue 
is how a few thousand Jews plan to vote" -- a cynical comment on the dominance 
of racial politics. The rule in Chicago is that black voters -- about 40% of 
the electorate -- vote for the black candidate. Working- and lower-middle-class 
whites -- another 40% -- vote for the white candidate. So the election is 
decided by the "lake-front liberals," the upper-middle-class, heavily Jewish 
voters along Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The rule may not hold true this year. Daley has been courting black voters, 
saying, "I don't want to be mayor for half the people." In fact, his father 
survived on a multiracial coalition. Machine politics was never "us against 
them"; it was always "something for us and something for them." Polls show 
Daley winning 17%-19% of the black vote in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the lake-front liberals are swinging heavily to Daley. Jewish voters 
were angered last year because Sawyer was reluctant to fire an aide who made 
inflammatory anti-Semitic statements. 
</P>
<P>
Many Chicago blacks are distressed by the prospect of losing the mayoralty to a 
white -- one named Daley at that. A racial Brezhnev Doctrine seems to dominate 
the thinking of some Chicago blacks: Once the city has fallen under black rule, 
it cannot be allowed to return to white control. 
</P>
<P>
But to everyone's surprise, racial politics has as yet failed to dominate the 
primary campaign. The real test will come in the April general election, 
however. Brown has said he will support Daley if he wins the Democratic 
primary. Jackson has not. Evans claims to be the legitimate heir to Washington. 
And Washington, who claimed victory in 1983 by declaring "Now it's our turn," 
was a successful practitioner of racial politics. 
</P>
<P>
Brown seemed to have much more trouble pledging his support for New York Mayor 
Edward I. Koch if he wins the Democratic nomination for a fourth term this 
September. When asked about Koch, Brown said his support would "probably 
include all legitimate Democrats" who win Democratic primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Koch clashed with Jackson during the New York presidential primary last year. 
More than a few people speculated that Koch attacked Jackson to provoke the 
black community into running a black candidate against him. 
</P>
<P>
The theory was that Koch could beat a black in a citywide primary, whereas a 
white liberal with black support might give him trouble. That theory will be 
tested in this year's Democratic primary. Koch will have a black opponent, 
Manhattan Borough President David N. Dinkins. Dinkins is a low-key politician 
with a record as a compromiser and conciliator. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins says he will appeal to black voters as an ethnic rather than a racial 
politician. What's the difference? Dinkins explains: "Of course some people 
will vote for one of their own. An Italian will vote for an Italian, Jews will 
vote for a Jew, blacks will vote for a black. I see that as racial pride, 
natural pride. The difference is the bigotry in the refusal to vote for someone 
on the basis of race." In other words, ethnic voting is voting for someone of 
your own group. Racial voting is voting against someone from a different group. 
</P>
<P>
In previous elections, Koch established a pattern. He lost the black vote in 
the primary and then carried blacks as the Democratic candidate in the general 
election. Apparently, blacks do not dislike him so much that they will desert 
the Democratic Party. That may change. Right now, polls show Dinkins well ahead 
of Koch. Dinkins is trying to do a Daley -- win the support of his race without 
resorting to racial politics. But Dinkins doesn't have Daley's name. And New 
York City is less black. Even if Koch wins the primary, he may face a strong 
GOP challenge from former federal prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who went 
after corruption on Wall Street and in city government. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, the white candidate is running against racial politics. In New 
York, a black candidate is doing the same. In both, the big test will be 
whether racial tension is strong enough to undermine loyalty to the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Black candidates for mayor of Los Angeles and governor of Virginia face a 
somewhat different test. Both races involve officeholders who have avoided 
racial politics. They had no choice. Los Angeles and the Commonwealth of 
Virginia are less than 20% black. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bradley, the four-term mayor of Los Angeles, has been called "the prototype 
of the electable black" -- low-key, non-threatening, former police officer. He 
is, in the words of a California Democratic politician, "a good liberal 
Republican." In fact, Bradley has been criticized because of his alliance with 
the business Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the only black statewide elected official in 
Virginia history, has the same non-controversial image. Wilder asked Jackson to 
stay out of his 1985 campaign. He ended up winning with 44% of the white vote. 
This year, Wilder is unopposed for the Democratic nomination for governor and 
may become the first elected black governor in U.S. history -- in a strongly 
GOP Southern state, no less. 
</P>
<P>
The Virginia race will be Atwater's Spanish Civil War. How will the GOP run 
against a black Democrat in a Southern state? Atwater critics accused him of 
running a racially charged presidential campaign for George Bush last year. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he did or not, it worked. Will Atwater be able to resist the temptation 
to run a racially charged campaign in Virginia? 
</P>
<P>
Brown can do a good deal to unify the Democratic Party. The issue is whether he 
can help reach beyond the liberal base. It used to be that Democrats could win 
national elections just by holding together. The new version of the theory 
claims that Democrats can win if they run a left-wing campaign that inspires 
sharply increased turnout among blacks, Latinos and poor people. 
</P>
<P>
Not true. In the current issue of Public Opinion magazine, political analyst 
Ruy Teixeira examines the evidence and concludes: "If both blacks and Hispanics 
had voted at rates 10 points higher than whites, the overall net gain for the 
Democrats, 4,340,000 votes, would have still fallen short of the number Dukakis 
needed for victory." Dukakis lost by 6.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
What Brown has to do is extend the Democrats' reach beyond a base of liberals, 
poor people and minorities. Since he has the confidence of the party's leading 
left-wing figure, Brown may be well-positioned to lead the Democrats toward the 
center. The problem is that Brown's political experience has been entirely 
within the Democratic Party. Atwater, by contrast, has spent most of his career 
running against Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater took the heat last year for the racial overtones of the Bush campaign. 
In his Feb. 9 speech to Congress, however, Bush promised to "work to knock down 
the barriers left by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society 
that will stop such barriers from ever being built again." 
</P>
<P>
Do blacks believe him? When Ronald Reagan took office in January, 1981, he won 
the approval of only 24% of blacks. Last month, according to the Gallup Poll, 
Bush was approved by 51% of blacks -- almost the same figure as among whites. 
That is the best news in a long time about the future of racial politics in 
America.

A SALVADORAN FUNERAL MARCH, WITH MEMORY OF U.S. POLICY

SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be a funeral march in the dry hills of western El Salvador this 
week. Wednesday marks the anniversary of the Las Hojas massacre. Las Hojas is a 
small Indian village far from the active war zone in this Central American 
country, with a distinctive folk culture descended from the Aztecs. On Feb. 22, 
1983, an army battalion massacred 74 residents of the area around the village. 
</P>
<P>
Both conservative policy-makers in the Reagan and Bush administrations, and 
liberals in the Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress avert their eyes from the 
Las Hojas massacre, preferring to argue about such more celebrated matters as 
the Nicaraguan Contras in El Salvador. But the massacre is a now-historic event 
that serves to strip away most of the deceptions that sustain U.S. policy 
toward El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom about El Salvador holds that there has been 
human-rights progress. Trained, armed and advised daily by U.S. military 
officers, the Salvadoran security forces have killed tens of thousands of 
unarmed civilians in the last eight years. Military death squads were 
assassinating up to 800 people a month in 1980 and 1981. Since 1983 and 1984, 
the number of killings has declined. The government of Christian Democrat Jose 
Napoleon Duarte, it was said, was demonstrating limited but real control over 
the country's military. The Congress and the White House, in turn, provided El 
Salvador with billions of dollars in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
The bipartisan consensus in Washington about the future of El Salvador is now 
being tested. The Duarte government has all but vanished in a cloud of 
corruption and incompetence. Death-squad killings are again on the rise. Even 
Vice President Dan Quayle acknowledged as much on his recent visit. And the 
guerrillas' proposal to delay elections, while they enter the electoral process 
for the first time, has thrown El Salvador's political parties into disarray. 
</P>
<P>
The massacre story reminds us that Salvadoran realities do not conform to U.S. 
rhetoric. In Las Hojas, all the common rationalizations of U.S. policy in El 
Salvador were exposed as untrue: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Human rights abuses like the Las Hojas massacre are often difficult to 
prosecute for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department concluded within a few days that the local garrison 
commander, Col. Elmer Gonzalez Araujo was responsible for ordering the 
massacre. So did a top Salvadoran military commander. 
</P>
<P>
According to a declassified State Department cable, the farmers of Las Hojas 
had won a legal dispute with a local wealthy landowner. The landowner then 
complained to Gonzalez, who ordered troops into action. The males of the area 
around Las Hojas, ages 11 to 73, were taken to a nearby riverbed with their 
hands tied behind their backs. All were shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salvadoran military leaders do not condone abuses committed by 
lower-ranking officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks after the massacre, Gonzalez was promoted to head the procurement 
agency of the Salvadoran armed forces. Since then, the colonel has never been 
demoted or reprimanded by his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The United States, while it cannot control the Salvadoran military, avoids 
dealing with the worst human-rights violators in its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1983, three months after the massacre, U.S. military advisers were 
helping Gonzalez purchase $4.7-million worth of ammunition with U.S. military 
aid from a firm in Virginia. Some U.S. advisers in El Salvador were concerned, 
not about dealing with a murderer, but about possible corruption in the 
ammunition deal. The deal went through anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When U.S. officials must deal with unsavory Salvadoran officers, they are 
extremely careful. 
</P>
<P>
 The fears of corruption were warranted. As was later revealed in U.S. federal 
court, Gonzalez and another colonel accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in kickbacks from the Virginia firm in return for overlooking the fact that the 
ammunition was falsely packaged. According to U.S. prosecutor Theodore 
Greenberg, Gonzalez himself pocketed at least $25,000 in U.S. military 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- President Duarte wants to punish flagrant human-rights abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte personally approved Gonzalez's appointment to head the country's Port 
Authority, another job with lucrative kickback possibilities. Gonzalez was 
never charged with any crime by Salvadoran civilian officials, much less put on 
trial. Several low-ranking soldiers from the garrison near Las Hojas did face 
charges for the massacre but were acquitted. A distraught relative of the 
victims who dared to complain to local authorities was arrested for disorderly 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the Salvadoran courts cannot act, the United States will use its 
influence to curb such abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The phony ammunitions deal resulted in the indictment of three U.S. 
businessmen. The Justice Department had sufficient evidence to indict Gonzalez 
as well. High-level Justice Department officials, after consulting with the 
State Department and the Pentagon, decided not to. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When "quiet diplomacy" fails, the United States will publicly criticize 
human-rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1984, the State Department told Congress that the Las Hojas 
massacre had been carried out "apparently by elements of a Salvadoran army 
unit." Yet U.S. diplomatic cables had already stated unequivocally that 
Gonzalez ordered the killings. The State Department's annual human-rights 
reports have failed to mention the Las Hojas case ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whatever happened in the past, Salvadoran military leaders and U.S. 
officials today condemn the massacre of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Salvadoran TV in October, 1986, Gonzalez defended the Las 
Hojas killings as a "legitimate military operation." No Salvadoran or U.S. 
official publicly disputed his statement. The colonel now heads the Office of 
Military Repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whatever the details of the Las Hojas massacre, the current Salvadoran 
government is committed to making sure that such abuses do not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 A Salvadoran court ruled last year that Gonzalez is now immune from 
prosecution under the amnesty provisions of the 1987 Central American peace 
plan. The Las Hojas massacre, the courts decided, was a "political" crime that 
should be forgiven in order to help bring the civil war to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the war goes on. So does Gonzalez. U.S. military analysts now state the 
obvious: The U.S.-backed war effort does not enjoy popular support. The Indians 
of Las Hojas will commemorate their loss by marching through the countryside, 
holding aloft large photos of the dead.

'RAVENS VS. TORTOISES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the excellent editorial "Ravens Vs. Tortoises" (Jan. 23) on the 
raven-control project initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. 
Bureau of Land Management, and the California Department of Fish and Game. As 
the editorial indicates, the service believes that the numbers of ravens using 
portions of desert tortoise habitat need to be reduced so that young tortoises 
have an opportunity to reach adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
You have also correctly noted that ravens are not the only problem facing the 
desert tortoise, indicating that control of off-road vehicle use would also 
benefit the species. However, more than ravens and ATCs need to be controlled. 
In addition to numerous housing developments being constructed in the 
Palmdale-Rosamond portion of the tortoise's range, loss of habitat has occurred 
through the development of solar energy plants, utility lines, sheep and cattle 
grazing, and mining activities. Projects that my staff are currently working on 
include a low-level radiation waste disposal site and the expansion of the 
Army's Fort Irwin National Training Center. These projects could destroy 
hundreds of square miles of tortoise habitat. 
</P>
<P>
I would also like to take this opportunity to correct one factual error in your 
editorial. The service has not proposed the tortoise for listing. We are still 
evaluating the need to list the species. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a petition to list the tortoise from the Desert Tortoise Council 
in 1984, the service issued a finding that listing of the species was 
warranted, but precluded by other listing proposals of higher priority. In 
other words, personnel and funding limitations have not permitted us to develop 
a listing for the tortoise. These findings must be updated annually. The 
priority for listing the tortoise becomes higher as a decline in tortoise 
numbers and habitat continues. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the California Fish and Game Commission has recently voted 
against providing protection to the desert tortoise by making it a listed 
threatened species is not viewed as a positive step in interagency cooperation 
to save the tortoise. In fact, the vote only increases the pressure on the 
federal agencies, the BLM and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to demonstrate 
that protection, not just planning, is being accomplished for the tortoise.

MASKING THE HUMAN FACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seeds of perestroika were sown in the Prague spring. It was there, 21 years 
ago, that the socialism of the East first showed the world its human face. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the government of Czechoslovakia will put playwright Vaclav Havel on 
trial for the crime of remembering that fact. 
</P>
<P>
According to Czech authorities, the 52-year-old writer was guilty of 
"incitement to a criminal act" and "obstructing public order" when he took part 
in a demonstration marking the 20th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, a 
Prague student who set himself on fire to protest the Soviet invasion that 
ended his country's experiment in reform. If convicted, Havel could be 
imprisoned for 2 1/2 years. Eight of those who joined him in the demonstration 
-- leaders of various independent peace and human-rights groups -- are to be 
tried on other, equally specious, charges. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, Jana Petrova, spokesman for the Independent Peace Assn., and Ota 
Veverka, leader of the John Lennon Peace Club, have been jailed since their 
arrest on Jan. 16. They were taken by police on the second of six days of 
protest in which thousands of Czechs took part. Many of them suffered violence 
at the hands of the authorities; more than 1,400 were detained and released. 
</P>
<P>
Havel is one of those rare beings in whose spirit courage has arranged a 
marriage of life and art. Two of his plays, "A Private View" and "Largo 
Desolato," have been performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Times 
theater critic Dan Sullivan recently described them as "doleful, funny looks at 
the way people adjust their principles to accommodate the political realities 
of the moment . . . . Havel's comedy is that of the tender conscience faced 
with the tough choice and either making it or backing away." 
</P>
<P>
Backing away is precisely the accommodation that Havel has refused to make. 
Three times since 1968 he has endured prison in the cause of human rights. He 
was an original signer of Charter 77, the citizens' initiative, and an early 
member of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Persecuted. Last year 
he signed "Democracy for All," the manifesto of Czechoslovakia's new Movement 
for Civil Liberties. He also serves on his country's Helsinki Watch Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relentless official harassment suffered by Havel the activist, 
Havel the artist has fashioned a unique body of work that is at once fully 
engaged and yet free of bitterness, propaganda or caricature. 
</P>
<P>
The thugs whose misrule passes for government in Czechoslovakia these days 
would be ill advised to assume that they can deal with Havel and his courageous 
colleagues as they will. The West knows and reveres Prague as the city of Kafka 
and Kundera, of Smetana and Dvorak, of Kosik and Patocka. The small men with 
the frozen hearts who hold power there should not delude themselves into 
thinking that they can make Havel a forgotten casualty in what Arthur Miller 
rightly has called their "war against the imagination."

BUSH'S UNVEILS BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nothing is so remarkable as Bush's behavior since he has taken office. In tone, 
manner, attitude and even policy, his entire thrust has been a rebuke, if not a 
repudiation of his predecessor. Most of all has been his call for a "kinder, 
gentler nation" -- a bit of a tongue-twister and easy to poke fun at. Kinder, 
gentler than what? Than the awful divisive and confrontational way it has been 
for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
If this is the real George Bush we are seeing (and I am disposed to think it 
is, despite the mean-spirited, even vicious campaign he waged), then one can 
only speculate as to the psychological implications of his apparently sitting 
on these decent impulses all this time, while Ronald Reagan, in his own 
guileless way, continually pandered to the base instincts of the American 
electorate.

In listening to President Bush's address to Congress as he called attention to 
programs that he said called for vigorous action -- cleaning up the 
environment, more funds for education, fighting drugs, easing the plight of the 
homeless, child care -- these are some of the very same programs for which 
Ronald Reagan didn't show too much enthusiasm or the inclination to do much 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that the President didn't realize that he was putting the knock on 
Ronnie?

THE MOLEHILL CLUB? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sierra Club without rock climbing or mountaineering? As well the Audubon 
Society without birds, or the Wilderness Society without trees. Climbing has 
been the heart and soul of the San Francisco-based organization founded by 
naturalist-mountaineer John Muir and others in 1892. Generations of 
Californians learned to love the Sierra Nevada through the club's wilderness 
trips. Muir's concept was to get people into the mountains so that they could 
really come to know them. By knowing the mountains, club members would fight to 
save the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands have learned to climb rock, ice and snow safely through club 
programs. But now the club's directors have voted to ban club-sanctioned 
climbing because of soaring insurance rates. As reported by The Times' Bettina 
Boxall, the Los Angeles-area chapter has dismantled part of its mountaineering 
course and dropped about 300 trips from its outing program. Protesting members 
are threatening to run a pro-climbing slate of candidates for the board. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the ban argue that the club no longer can afford the luxury 
of an insurance rate increase of at least $325,000 a year in behalf of a 
minority of members, out of a national roster of nearly 500,000, who want to 
engage in roped climbing. Ironically, those who supported the ban include 
former executive director David Brower, a pioneer of rock climbing in Yosemite 
and the Sierra. Brower said that members can go climb on their own while the 
club works to save "the damn mountains they want to climb." There still will be 
wilderness trips, but none onto the heights where ropes or ice axes are 
required, and no instruction courses for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club no longer is just a California society, of course. It has 
broadened its environmental horizon to national and global issues, particularly 
since Brower's tenure as executive director, and has developed lobbying clout 
in Washington and state capitals. The climbing decision is regrettable, but 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
Club members were at the center of the development of high-angle, roped rock 
climbing in the West in 1931 when Harvard's Robert L. M. Underhill brought his 
Alpine training to the Sierra at the invitation of Francis Farquhar. The 
summer's highlight was the Aug. 16 first ascent of the east face of 14,495-foot 
Mt. Whitney by Underhill, Norman Clyde, Jules Eichorn and Glen Dawson. Not 
difficult by today's standards, the east face remains a classic route. The 
club's Rock Climbing Section was soon formed, and the club later published 
"Belaying the Leader," the primer and bible for a generation of California 
climbers who ultimately took their Sierra-learned skills to the summits of the 
Alps, the Cordilleras of South America, to Canada, Alaska and the Himalayas. 
</P>
<P>
The ban will not eliminate the club's presence in the Sierra heights, however. 
Every major Sierra peak has a metal box stamped with the Sierra Club seal and 
containing a summit register to be signed by all who make the top. But on the 
most difficult, and best, peaks in the Sierra that no longer will include 
official Sierra Club groups.

BUSH'S UNVEILS BUDGET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, President Bush's "Good Start on the Environment" (editorial, Feb. 10) is 
indeed a welcome change in attitude from the recent past, and it is a relief to 
know that he is willing to postpone the proposed oil-lease sale off our coast. 
</P>
<P>
However, it must be recognized that the California coast is anything but a 
pristine territory; wherein the Wildlife Refuge on the north coast of Alaska is 
precisely this -- pristine. That the President is ready to degrade Alaska's 
Wildlife Refuge is evidence that he will abandon environmental progress any 
time it conflicts with private exploitation of public resources; and this is 
hardly environmental progress for its own value. 
</P>
<P>
We need a kinder and a wiser concept of the ecology than the President evinces.

THE ENGLISH-ONLY MOVEMENT LEGITIMIZES ATTACKS ON BROTHERHOOD AND TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY NICHOLS, Mary Nichols is the California director of People For the 
American Way, a nonpartisan constitutional-liberties organization. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brotherhood and good will can be protected only by being alert to challenges to 
them. Some of the challenges -- like ethnic slurs, hate-filled graffiti and 
racist violence -- are crude and obvious. Others are subtle but no less 
dangerous. In particular, an ugly strain of prejudice against immigrants and 
other "foreigners" has emerged in California, slickly packaged and with an 
innocent-sounding name: the official-English movement. 
</P>
<P>
This movement, more accurately called the English-only movement, wants to pass 
local and federal laws making English our "official" language nationwide, as 
Proposition 63 did for California in 1986. The movement's representatives argue 
that English is in danger of being displaced by other languages, especially 
Spanish. The movement likes to paint itself as a moderate, common-sense effort 
striving only to promote national unity by preserving America's 
English-language heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The English-under-siege argument is simply wrong. According to the 1980 census, 
98% of American residents over 4 years old speak English "well" or "very well." 
A 1985 RAND Corp. study found that among first-generation Americans whose 
mother tongue is Spanish, 90% are proficient in English and 50% of their 
children can't speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The claim that the English-only movement was moderate and promoted national 
unity could have appeared plausible until the passage of English-only laws at 
the state and local levels. But, in the aftermath of Proposition 63 and similar 
measures elsewhere, it is clear that English-only policies only encourage 
hostility toward immigrants and increase intolerance toward citizens, 
especially Asians and Latinos, whose first language is not English. 
</P>
<P>
A continuing legal battle in Monterey Park is a case in point. In 1987 a slate 
of candidates was elected to the Monterey Park City Council pledging to put 
teeth into Proposition 63 at the local level. After taking office, some of the 
council members expressed concern over the number of non-English (mainly 
Chinese-language) books on the Monterey Park public library's shelves, despite 
the fact that the books made up less than 10% of the library's stock. In 
October that year, the council dissolved the library's independent board of 
commissioners and took control of library management. Although the council used 
"financial account-ability" as a justification, its subsequent actions made 
clear that its real motivation was contempt for the rights of language 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The council slashed the library's 1988-89 budget for foreign-language materials 
from more than $11,000 to about $3,000. Mayor Barry L. Hatch was surprisingly 
frank about his view that the public library's services should be extended only 
to citizens able to read English. "I don't think we need to cater too much to 
foreign languages," Hatch said. "I think if people want a foreign language they 
can go purchase books on their own." 
</P>
<P>
This intolerant rights-for-some-but-not-for-others attitude outraged other 
members of the Monterey Park community and led to a lawsuit filed by Monterey 
Park citizens and civil-liberties groups in Superior Court. The suit seeks to 
reinstate the library board as a way to ensure that the public library serves 
all of Monterey Park's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Similar incidents have occurred in other cities, too. In Huntington Park, 
municipal-court employees were forbidden to speak to each other in Spanish, but 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court ruled the ban illegal. English-only supporter S. I. 
Hayakawa has said that Proposition 63 prohibits government workers even from 
discussing their lunch plans in Spanish. At a hospitalin Los Angeles, the head 
nurse forbade workers to speak any language but English and urged employees to 
report anyone who violated the ban. The manager of an insurance company ordered 
employees not to converse in Chinese unless they were dealing with a 
Chinese-speaking customer. 
</P>
<P>
English-only laws were adopted last November in Colorado, Arizona and Florida, 
and are already being used to harass Latinos. In Miami a supermarket clerk was 
suspended after he spoke Spanish to another worker. When a woman called a 
department store to place an order and began speaking in Spanish, the clerk 
cited the English-only law and hung up. In Grand Junction, Colo., a school-bus 
driver told a student that speaking Spanish was no longer allowed on board. 
</P>
<P>
The idea that laws like Proposition 63 are merely symbolic, or just common 
sense, or only promote national unity, is a fantasy. The record of English-only 
legislation demonstrates that it legitimizes attacks on brotherhood and 
tolerance, encouraging an ugly strain of bigotry that has no place in American 
society.

SOVIETS PLAY DIFFERENT TUNE IN THEIR NEW CAMPAIGN FOR A ROLE IN MIDEAST PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN P. HANNAH, John P. Hannah is a fellow in Soviet affairs at the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What a difference a decade makes. The last time a Soviet foreign minister 
traveled to the Middle East, his sole objective was to undermine the 
Arab-Israeli peace process. Now, ten years later, Moscow's chief diplomat is 
helping to assemble a regional coalition in favor of a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Back in March, 1979, the only stop on Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko's 
itinerary was Syria, where he arrived bearing arms and support to bolster the 
Assad regime in its rejection of the approaching peace treaty between Egypt and 
Israel. This week, in stark contrast, Gromyko's successor, Eduard I. 
Shevardnadze, is visiting Jordan, Egypt, Iraq and Iran in addition to Syria, 
which he wants to fall in line behind an emerging group of Arab parties that 
support peace talks with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The switch in Moscow's policy represents no overnight conversion. For three 
years the Soviets have been struggling to apply the principles of Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's "new thinking" to the complexities of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
And though it is constrained by intransigent local allies and the exigencies of 
traditional superpower rivalry, Soviet policy has gradually, though in an 
oftentimes halting fashion, begun to change in ways that favor a political 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Thus there has been a significant upturn in relations with Israel to the point 
where the restoration of full diplomatic ties seems no longer a question of if, 
but when. Similarly, Moscow's relations with traditionally pro-Western Arab 
states have improved. Today, tensions over the direction of the peace process 
are far more likely to result from disagreements with long-time friends in 
Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization than with moderate leaders in 
Egypt and Jordan. Indicative of this change was Moscow's policy toward the PLO 
late last year. Working with Egypt and against the expressed wishes of Syria, 
the Soviet Union played an important role in convincing Yasser Arafat to 
recognize Israel's right to exist and renounce terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
There is some reason to believe, therefore, that Shevardnadze is genuine in 
wanting to use his trip to "give new impetus to a Middle Eastern settlement." 
At the same time, however, he clearly hopes to enhance Moscow's claim to a 
central role in any future negotiations. In this sense, the timing of the visit 
is no accident. With the Bush Administration still in the throes of transition, 
and American strategy toward the Middle East clearly in flux, Shevardnadze's 
high-profile tour aims to demonstrate the vitality and purpose of Soviet 
diplomacy in the region. Even more important, Moscow wants to preempt the 
United States' Mideast agenda by confronting Washington with a joint 
Soviet-Arab approach to the peace process, one that focuses on an international 
conference with Soviet participation. This unified position would be presented 
to President Bush by Jordan's King Hussein and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak 
during their visits to Washington this spring. 
</P>
<P>
With or without "new thinking," such efforts to strengthen the Soviet position 
in the Middle East should come as no surprise. After all, Moscow remains a 
great power with real interests and aspirations in the region. What is new and 
encouraging is that the Soviets increasingly seek to augment their influence 
through policies that bolster stability rather than undermine it, through 
policies that make Arab-Israeli negotiations more feasible rather than less. A 
willingness to publicly rebuke Syrian militarism, to align with moderate Arab 
positions on the peace process, and to help temper PLO rejectionism are all 
actions that should not be discounted too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, significant differences continue to exist between Moscow and 
Washington on important questions. The Soviet view of an international 
conference with broad powers to effect a settlement remains unacceptable to the 
United States, as does Moscow's insistence on an independent Palestinian state. 
But increasingly, with Soviet policy demonstrating new flexibility and 
pragmatism, these demands appear more as opening bargaining positions than as 
ultimatums. As such, they suggest that Washington should continue bilateral 
discussions with Moscow to explore ways in which the Soviets might contribute 
to an environment that is propitious for direct Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
One complaint that must be registered about Shevardnadze's itinerary is that it 
does not include Israel, arguably the most important player in the peace 
process. Moscow may insist that it is constrained by the objections of its Arab 
friends, but it remains a fact that the Soviet Union's claim to a mediator's 
role in negotiations will never be entirely credible so long as it fails to 
establish a normal working relationship with Israel. Everything suggests that 
this is only a matter of time. Still, Shevardnadze would be well advised to 
include an extra stop on his next trip. Next year, as the saying goes, in 
Jerusalem.

ON VIEW: BACHELORS HAVE A BALL WITH 'TRANSYLVANIA NIGHTMARE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Bachelors Ball in the International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton was, 
well, sort of unbelievable, and that may have been why, almost without 
exception, post-ball chat was rating it a 10 -- one of the best Bachelors balls 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
This was the 84th anniversary fancy dress affair. Members of the prominent 
organization of young men host the annual party, they say, to pay back social 
obligations incurred during the year. 
</P>
<P>
This party sizzled, even with the theme "A Nightmare in Transylvania," which 
led arriving guests through an eerie tunnel, through a graveyard where 
prominent bachelor John Welborne found his name on at least four tombstones. 
"It's some sort of in-joke," Welborne, costumed as the devil, said. "Only I am 
not the devil; I am a devil." He had hosted his four tables -- 32 guests, $220 
a couple -- at a pre-cocktail party at Trader Vic's. The entourage included 
Spike and Debby Booth, wearing authentic Japanese robes. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sort of night that found Elvis with Priscilla (Martin Spencer and 
Tracy Sanders), Laurel with Hardy (Randy Carroll and Susan Dick), the Prince of 
Wales with Princess Diana (Pat McKoskey and his fiancee, Kathy Lee), King Tut 
with Cleopatra (Steve Hobbs and Lori Parrish), a conquistador with a Spanish 
dancer (Grafton Tanquary III -- his father was a Bachelor -- with Robin Wood). 
</P>
<P>
Pamela and Robert Kidney came as Mr. and Mrs. Mac the Knife. Lisa Dennis and 
Bachelors treasurer William Bessolo were Indians. Stephanie and Mark Reuter 
were handsome space police -- or were they cats? Lyn Vandegrift wore a Chinese 
costume and a snake mask, escorted by Gordon Pashigan. But when Vern Monroe 
walked through the cocktail party carrying a huge python, there was near 
pandemonium as guests all but fell over one another to avoid contact. 
</P>
<P>
The "Dangerous Liaisons" costumes were abundant. Laura Perkins was one, 
flirting with "Napoleon" David Brittain, a new Bachelors board member. John 
Thompson and Tracy Verna were drum majors, Adam Bianchi a gangster and Penny 
Bianchi a flapper (Missy Wilkins was a flapper too), joining Nancy Davis, 
Donald Spitz, Jerry Zorthian, in elegant regalia, at Peter Adams' table. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, partygoers fussed with their costumes. Bachelors president Walter 
Wilson found his Dracula face peeling as he stood at the receiving line, 
awaiting his date Dr. Patricia McKeever (on professional duty as an intern at 
County-USC Medical Center) to glue him back together. Not only is Wilson a 
Bachelor, but his late father, Philip Wilson Jr., was one and so were two of 
his brothers, Philip III and Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those costumes must be uncomfortable. A mock television set on the 
shoulders of one guest prevented communication, though the picture was clear. 
But even with a horse costume on his head, Dan Palmer "jumped" the entire night 
with his date, Ashley Bren, in hunter togs. On the other hand, there was a 
comfy table of laid-back Brooklyn Dodgers, handing out baseball cards, another 
table of more intense '20s golfers (Mark Hennessey and Julie Dalton and Paul 
and Mopy Locker), handing out tees. 
</P>
<P>
Most authentic, perhaps, was the Air Force jacket, hat and wings worn by 
Richard Hadfield (escorting Gabrielle Gottlieb), which was worn by his late 
uncle who was killed in a training air crash at Bakersfield during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at their tables, guests found rock 'n' rolling bats with red eyes 
gyrating on the ceiling above them. Programs at the tables were cutout mummies 
lying on cotton balls inside paper coffins. They became collectors' items, 
disappearing from tables about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
That was all after dinner was served at a leisurely 10:45 p.m., and after the 
men at Bachelors Hugh Evans' (with Jeanne Crowley) and Chris Liebes' tables of 
camouflaged jungle fighters slid down the railings to the dance floor in high 
spirits as Bob Gail's orchestra struck up "She's a Honky Tonk Woman," a 
favorite Bachelors' song. 
</P>
<P>
And, it was after Arthur McClure was complimented that he looked "most 
bucolic," sitting at the Bachelors' Patroness table with Bonnie McClure, Penne 
and Bill Durst, Margaret and John Given, Judy and Steven Jones, Jo and Bob 
Kroger (whose son Jim flew down from San Francisco for the party). 
</P>
<P>
And it was also after Briant Howes' table of sailors, including Henry 
Williamson and Robin Ferrante, whirled to "Celebration," after the juggler 
juggled grapefruit, after a duck popped out of a silver tray. 
</P>
<P>
By then, Santa Claus was dancing with the Easter bunny, and Bachelors vice 
president Chip Stuart, ball chairman, and his co-chair Casey Griffin were 
dousing the dripping candles. 
</P>
<P>
It's the sort of party that sends the young crowd to the airport. Carllyn 
Haldeman, daughter of Sue and Tom Haldeman, flew in from New York to be Richard 
Mogan's date. New Yorker Joan Cavalero flew in to join Neil McCathy. And Leslie 
Graham, moving here from New York, came feather-boaed with Madison Offenhauser, 
sitting at Scott Albrecht's table. 
</P>
<P>
Funniest line of the night, we hear, came from the men's room: Two gangsters 
were reportedly washing their hands. One well-heeled gangster says to the 
other, "Nice suit. C&amp;R?" 
</P>
<P>
ROMANCE: Eugenia Erskine of San Francisco (she's the daughter of Paul and 
Georgianna Erskine of Pasadena) and her fiance, Don Jesberg of the Bay area, 
have been widely feted in the Southland with prenuptial parties. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Lewis and her daughter, Carey MacNiff, gave a luncheon with violet 
nosegays at each place. Joan and Jim Caillouette, Roberta and Sandy Huntley and 
Elizabeth and Steve Algermissen invited guests to bring a bottle of wine for 
the young couple at their dinner. Now, Sandy and Maria Mallace, Patty and Roger 
Burschinger, Jane Simpson and Jakie and Ted Engs join to host a Mexican fiesta 
before the wedding here April 1. 
</P>
<P>
RECEPTION: Happy that the Grammy Awards will be in Los Angeles on Wednesday, 
Mayor Tom Bradley and the Los Angeles Host Committee, headed by Sheldon I. 
Ausman, host a welcoming celebration for the National Academy of Recording Arts 
and Sciences and the 1989 Grammy nominees on Monday evening at the Gene Autry 
Western Heritage Museum. NARAS will honor Gene Autry with the President's Merit 
Award. 
</P>
<P>
KUDOS: To Bruce Meyer, honored by the Beverly Hills CPR with its "From the 
Heart Award" at a '50s party at Ed Debevic's in Beverly Hills. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To Carl Terzian, a founder nearly 30 years ago of California Lutheran 
University, Thousand Oaks, saluted for nine years as a regent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To Jeanne and Bob Morrissey, who hosted the California Wine Patrons gourmet 
dinner at the Four Oaks restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
RED LETTER DATES: British Consul General Donald and Elizabeth Ballantyne will 
be at the forefront of the second of three foreign motion picture screenings by 
American Film Institute Associates next Sunday. Skouras Pictures hosts a supper 
after the L.A. premiere of "High Hopes." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a tie-in with consular groups in Los Angeles and an effort by AFI 
to increase membership in its International Film Society, the consul general of 
Denmark presided at the supper hosted by Ava and Chuck Fries, Didi and Fernando 
Gelbard and Sybil and Jim Goldrich after the showing of "Pelle the Conqueror." 
</P>
<P>
Consul General Ma Yuzhen of the People's Republic of China is in the spotlight 
March 19 for the screening of "Woman Demon Human."

ZAN THOMPSON: NOT TO WORRY -- HER CHECK'S IN THE MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"April is the cruelest month" is a silly thing to say, even if it was mouthed 
by that eminent grump, T. S. Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows the cruelest month is March. The only thing good to be said 
about March, besides the jubilant observance of St. Patrick's Day, is that 
there is the occasional smog-dispersing breeze. For the rest of the month, it's 
hair shirts and ashes and prepare your income tax. 
</P>
<P>
For the past couple of months, I have been receiving little bits of paper 
telling me how much money I have made during the year. Obviously, as usual, the 
IRS has my records mixed up with someone else's. I certainly didn't make all 
that money. Not that it's so much, but if I had I would be spending the winter 
in a white villa on Mykonos, or, maybe, the Smeralda Coast. I certainly 
wouldn't be sitting in Pasadena watching the begonias freeze. 
</P>
<P>
My accountant is a tall, good-looking man with a shock of white hair and his 
name is Richard Martin. I don't have enough money to need an accountant and if 
I had the mathematical aptitude of a newt, I wouldn't have one. But I don't and 
I do. 
</P>
<P>
Dick has worked out a grand little system for me to keep track of things and if 
I did it throughout the year instead of starting March 14, it would probably 
work very well. 
</P>
<P>
I want Dick to know that I speak grandly of my accountant when I am with the 
smart people, just as I speak very largely of my stock broker, Chuck Waterman. 
Chuck is also broker to a number of people who never have had to ask, "How 
much?" in all their lives. I think he keeps me as a client just to stay humble. 
</P>
<P>
They are both, Dick and Chuck, kind, patient and long-suffering and I never 
know one word they are saying. Through the years, I have worked out a method of 
leaning back in the chair, gazing at them, and nodding my head rhythmically, 
like one of those Oriental birds. 
</P>
<P>
Then I thank them and get up and go out and they do whatever they do. 
</P>
<P>
This is what I do for Dick's system. He has numbered every category of possible 
expenditure for me -- utilities, medical, travel, entertainment, business, 
miscellaneous. The last category is always the largest. 
</P>
<P>
I go through my check registers and write the appropriate number on every check 
notation. There are always several notations of quite large amounts of money 
made to people whom I don't know. Names like Farquarson Brothers. These checks 
will be in amounts as large as $300. Unfortunately, there is never a notation 
to remind me of what the Farquarson fellows did for me. 
</P>
<P>
Now, this is obviously the result of secret hypnosis or mind control. I would 
certainly remember writing a check for $300. Right. That's more money than I 
ever saw at one time until I was 23 and my husband came home from World War II 
with $1,000 in cash in the bottom of his duffel bag. He had won it in an 
extended crap game coming home on the Queen Mary. (We used it to put a down 
payment on a house, in case you're wondering.) 
</P>
<P>
There are usually six or eight of those checks for large amounts that I do not 
remember. I am sure these renegade hypnotists operate in your checkbook too. 
Surely, I am not the only one singled out for such chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
I take the check registers to Dick, and he looks at them for a long time, 
saying nothing. Then, he gently suggests that I read the contents of my check 
registers into his tape recorder so his assistant can "punch them in." That's 
because his assistant can't read my impeccable Palmer method handwriting. When 
he says "punch in," I have enough sense to know that we are moving into the 
computer area, and it is time for me to leave before he asks any penetrating 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a few days, I get a great heap of neatly printed pages and two stamped 
envelopes. Then I send two checks, one to the feds and one to the state. 
</P>
<P>
In a few weeks, many of my friends are nattering happily about their income tax 
refunds and what they are going to do with the money. 
</P>
<P>
I either don't get any back or I already owe it to the Farquarson Brothers.

ON AGING: OFFENDERS MAY OUTGROW LIFE OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The UCLA/USC Long-Term Care Gerontology Center 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reason there are so few reports about older criminals is that, with age, 
most give up the trade. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, one-half 
of all people arrested for property crimes such as theft and robbery are 19 or 
younger. By contrast, only 19% are 30 or older. 
</P>
<P>
Why is aging -- and the changes that accompany it -- such an effective 
deterrent to criminal behavior? Like many non-offenders, aging criminals "begin 
to take stock of their lives and their accomplishments," sociologist Neal 
Shover writes in "Aging Criminals." He reports on interviews with 50 offenders 
who were 40 and older. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, many gradually view their youthful criminal identity as 
"stupid," and reshape once-grandiose aspirations into more modest but 
attainable goals. They grow more aware of time as a limited resource and, 
consequently, are more reluctant to spend it in prison. The development of 
satisfying relationships and ties to legitimate employment also encourage a 
more conventional life style. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having learned to avoid trouble in prison, "older criminals will say 
that the time gets harder to do," says UCLA sociologist Jack Katz, author of 
"Seductions of Crime: Moral and Sensual Attractions in Doing Evil." He 
attributes this in part to "a loss of fascination in the myths and dramas that 
young people act out in crime. . . . In a hedonistic way, the seductions (of 
crime) become less attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Noting that many offenders go straight in their 20s or 30s, Katz speculates 
that withdrawing from crime is a life-cycle phenomenon akin to outgrowing 
adolescence -- for persistent criminals, a prolonged one. 
</P>
<P>
Successful older offenders who have prospered financially from crime are least 
likely to give it up, according to Shover. Nevertheless, he writes, many 
eventually mend their ways "in large measure because of real or imagined 
infirmities of age." 
</P>
<P>
Question: On Christmas Day, my 73-year-old mother called paramedics because my 
father was ill. The individual who answered the phone apparently refused to 
take the call seriously. Fortunately, my brother dropped by and noticed that my 
father's breathing was very shallow. 
</P>
<P>
He called the paramedics and, within one-half hour, my father was in the 
emergency room. Why didn't they pay attention to my mother's call? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Although most paramedics respond to emergencies appropriately, there 
have been cases where the paramedic operator failed to "pick up" on the 
seriousness of the call. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency operators must make quick decisions with little information. Often 
when people call 911, they fail to transmit vital information because they are 
so overwhelmed with concern for the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible explanation is that the operator responded to your brother 
because it was the second call about the same individual. And though it rings 
of ageism and sexism, it may be that your brother's voice commanded more 
respect from the operator than your mother's. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Marshall Morgan of UCLA's Emergency Medicine Center, callers 
should give as specific information as possible. For example: "My father is 
having trouble breathing, has pain in his arm and has a history of heart 
problems." A specific description helps the emergency operator make an 
immediate decision without needing to ask many questions. 
</P>
<P>
To improve emergency-operator responses, many paramedic programs are developing 
guidelines to help determine real emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm a 52-year-old bride-to-be who will be tying the knot the second time 
around this spring. Can you advise me on what to wear? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most second-time brides prefer pale colors or off-white. If you are planning 
an informal wedding, a knee-length suit or silk dress would be a good choice. 
If your wedding is more formal, you may want to wear a romantic dress of lace 
or chiffon with a mid-calf or long skirt. One advantage of a suit is that it 
can be worn again with a different blouse or buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping options include bridal departments and boutiques, securing the 
assistance of a personal shopper or having an item made-to-order. Some 
wedding-dress manufacturers have a collection geared for second marriages. 
</P>
<P>
Most bridal experts recommend wearing a hat, bow or flowers, but not a veil.

GASTRIC BALLOON CURBS THE APPETITE; 
</P>
<P>
RATIONALE IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL FEEL FULL, EAT LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I was interested in reading in your column about the use of a balloon 
that goes into a person's stomach so that he doesn't feel like eating so much. 
What I don't quite understand is how the balloon gets into the stomach. How big 
is it? Am I right in assuming that it cannot be swallowed? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The gastric balloon is placed in the patient's stomach through a 
narrow, flexible tube that passes down the throat and the esophagus. The 
balloon is deflated when inserted, and then blown up to about the size of a 
grapefruit. The entire procedure can be accomplished within a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the gastric balloon avoids the need for surgery. The rationale behind 
its use is that the person will feel full and therefore tend to eat less. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I had always been under the impression that syphilis was a curable disease, 
but I saw some figures recently about the number of cases that are found each 
year. If syphilis is curable, why should so many people be getting it? It would 
seem to me that it would have been wiped out by now. 
</P>
<P>
A: Penicillin can cure all stages of syphilis, but not unless the patient makes 
himself or herself available for treatment. The later a person is treated, the 
larger the dose that will be needed and the longer the duration of treatment. 
Those who are allergic to penicillin may be treated with tetracycline or 
erythromycin; however, tetracycline should not be used by pregnant women 
because it causes permanent discoloration of the baby's teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does myocardial infarction and heart attack mean the same thing? I have even 
heard both expressions used in the same sentence, so I'm beginning to think 
that they are actually the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
A: Myocardial infarction is the medical term for heart attack. "Myocardial" 
refers to the heart muscle, and "infarction" refers to tissue death. Other 
terms used to refer to a heart attack are coronary occlusion, coronary 
thrombosis, or just plain coronary. In general, they all mean the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If a man has an ostomy will that make him impotent? I know there are some 
operations that do have this effect. 
</P>
<P>
A: Ostomy surgery may cause impotence or sterility in some patients, but this 
does not occur in all cases. In one study of more than 300 patients, 12% 
reported that they experienced such problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a teacher and occasionally there is a child in one of my classes who is 
on insulin. I would appreciate some information about the symptoms of an 
insulin reaction. How may I recognize one? I would like to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
A: The early symptoms of an insulin reaction include hunger, sweating, 
irritability, headache, an increased pulse rate and increased blood pressure. 
Later, the patient may show confusion and bizarre behavior. And, still later, 
convulsions and coma may occur.

LEARNING TO COPE WITH TOO MANY CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were scary stories in the Sunday paper: "911 System Crashes," "Medicare 
Costs Rising," "Jerry Brown Returns to California Politics." Scariest of all 
was "Overchoice . . . Experts . . . Wonder . . . If 57 Varieties . . . Too Much 
of a Good Thing." 
</P>
<P>
Only in America would such a complaint be printed in a major newspaper. The 
gist of the polemic was that the marvelous abundance of goods produced by 
capitalism causes consumer stress and anxiety. The implied conclusion: These 
dumb bunnies need to be protected for their own good from greedy, manipulative 
marketers. 
</P>
<P>
Who are the protectors? Why, experts! Experts like the psychologist/attorney 
who sells relief from such terrible stress. Experts like author Jeremy Rifkin, 
who now ventures into pop psychology to tell us that people are really 
emotionally stressed over product choices. What Rifkin is selling is control 
over people's lives. He wants rules. And he wants to be the rule-maker. 
</P>
<P>
It's the rule-maker's never ending refrain: People are too stupid, apathetic, 
irresponsible, to be free. They cannot possibly enjoy America's abundance. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that as country after country turns away from rules and regulations 
and toward free-market capitalism, aspiring rule makers work ever harder here 
at home. The marketplace will cure "overchoice," if it exists, by bankrupting 
products and companies which do not provide value.

THE AIR FARE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My mother passed away in New York on Saturday, Dec. 10, 1988. Since the Jewish 
religion requires burial as soon as possible, the services were scheduled for 
Monday, Dec. 12. That meant that the only flight I could take that would get me 
there on time was the Sunday evening "red eye." 
</P>
<P>
I began calling both American and United Air Lines, as well as others, and was 
informed by all of them that there were no provisions for reduced fares due to 
emergencies. I had some other people call and also had my travel agents call 
regarding this. They were all told the same thing, no reduced fares. 
</P>
<P>
You have given American and United Airlines positive publicity that they do not 
deserve. My trip cost me almost $1,200 to fly into New York on Sunday night and 
back to Los Angeles on Monday afternoon.

THE AIR FARE CONTROVERSY

Simross wrote about shopping for emergency air fares where there is a death in 
the family. Recently I researched this problem for myself and found that Delta 
Airlines has an exceptional program. They offer a 35% discount for all family 
members traveling to a funeral from within the continental United States. This 
would include whether or not you are traveling with the remains as required by 
some of the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a specific policy as opposed to whatever relief may be gained from a 
supervisor. The phone number is (800) DL CARES.

 The Delta Airlines DL CARES program is unusual in the airline business because 
the carrier has an 800 number for consumers to dial in case of a death in the 
family. The requirement for the 35% discount on a regular coach fare is only 
that Delta must be shipping the remains of the deceased. Family members do not 
have to fly on the same flight with the body. Family members may get the 
discounted funeral fare from Delta up to one day prior to the shipping of the 
body and up to 21 days after.

THE AIR FARE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Shopping for Emergency Air Fares" (by Lynn Simross, Jan. 26): 
</P>
<P>
I am writing to thank Simross on behalf of my sister and brother-in-law. Last 
Wednesday, my brother-in-law, Mike, was notified of the death of his father in 
Michigan. On Thursday morning Simross' article was in the View section. 
</P>
<P>
After trying two airlines with no success, he called American Airlines and the 
agent agreed to give them the discount air fare -- saving them approximately 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
To have to face this unexpected and unplanned-for expense when you are so upset 
just adds to your distress. So your information helped to ease the burden a 
little by saving them a considerable amount of money.

UNDERGROUND PARKING FOR 600 PLANNED NEAR TAR PITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Methane or no methane, fossils or no fossils, workers have begun readying the 
site of an $8-million, four-story parking structure beneath the park that 
surrounds the La Brea tar pits. 
</P>
<P>
They have daubed red blobs of paint to mark several dozen trees that are to be 
taken out to make way for the excavation, but county officials said Hancock 
Park will be restored once construction is complete sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaped to look like a big bump in the grass behind the George C. Page 
Museum, the parking bunker will have room for 600 cars and 30,000 square feet 
of office and storage space. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the top story on the north side to be open for fresh air and 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
The garage will provide parking for employees and visitors to the nearby Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, as well as to the Page Museum, which displays 
prehistoric fossils found in the tar pits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortage of Parking 
</P>
<P>
For years, both museums have been suffering from a shortage of parking, which 
was worsened by the institution of permit parking on nearby streets last year. 
On a busy weekend, the museums can attract as many as 15,000 visitors a day. 
</P>
<P>
The Page Museum parking lot holds about 180 cars, while the art museum's lot on 
the south side of Wilshire Boulevard has room for 300. 
</P>
<P>
Named after a pioneer landowner, the 25-acre Allen Hancock Park is famous for 
its fossilized deposits of saber-toothed tiger bones and other prehistoric 
remains, many of which remain unexcavated. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions have been made for scientific teams to oversee the removal of any 
fossils that are found, said Bill Wise, chief analyst for Los Angeles County's 
chief administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
The park, located between Wilshire Boulevard and 6th Street just east of 
Fairfax Avenue, is in an area riddled with methane deposits. The nearby 
intersection of Fairfax Avenue and 3rd Street was closed for two days last week 
when methane-monitoring devices detected a high buildup of the volatile vapor. 
</P>
<P>
But Wise said soil tests and other precautions will be taken to guard against 
danger from underground pockets of methane gas. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends what you find," Wise said. "There will be special foundation 
systems, monitoring devices, vents, whatever you need." 
</P>
<P>
Wise said the construction contract for the parking structure allows for it to 
be erected on the surface if the underground plan proves unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Plans 
</P>
<P>
Originally designed to be built above ground, the proposed structure was moved 
below the surface at the instigation of nearby residents, Supervisor Ed Edelman 
and museum benefactor George C. Page. 
</P>
<P>
"To build a concrete warehouse for automobiles without the deepest 
consideration of our heritage and the pride we have for our park would be 
ludicrous," said Franklin W. Thornton, the architect picked by Page to design 
the parking structure. It will be "unobtrusive and non-architectural," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Page, founder of the Mission Pak holiday gift box business, who launched 
the museum with a $3-million gift. It opened in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Page paid for $50,000 worth of new architectural renderings that helped 
persuade the Board of Supervisors to go along with the more expensive and 
technically challenging underground version of the parking structure, said Mark 
Rodriguez, chief deputy director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History. The Page Museum is a branch of the county museum. 
</P>
<P>
The garage will be financed by bonds that are to be paid off by parking fees. 
Excess revenues generated by the fees are expected to begin flowing into the 
county's general fund within four years. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing we've got going here is that the community is going to get a 
facility that's going to pay for itself and meet the needs of that area," 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, he said, "the use of the park was limited to those who could walk to 
it or those who are fortunate enough to find parking." 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Bratton, deputy director of the art museum, said the need for parking 
was increased by the possibility of a new commercial development at the corner 
of Fairfax Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the museum is going to be here for a while, and we could see that 
parking for patrons is a critical need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also welcomed the enhanced lighting and security precautions that will be 
part of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Cohen of the Miracle Mile Residential Assn. said the decision to put the 
garage underground was welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Our main interest would be to keep that open space available so that there's a 
lot of recreational space and it feels open, and it appears that this will do 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen is chairwoman of the board of the residential association and president 
of the Miracle Mile Civic Coalition, which includes corporate executives and 
museum officials. 
</P>
<P>
She said the two groups also hope to plant new trees on the city-owned sidewalk 
strips that surround the county park and to install new landscaping on the 
median strip of Wilshire Boulevard in front of the museums. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our 'Central Park,' and we've got to take care of it," she said.

MITSUBISHI DEALER TO FACE DMV HEARING ON FRAUD COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG QUINTANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Department of Motor Vehicles is seeking to revoke or suspend the 
sales license of a West Covina auto dealership because of an alleged pattern of 
consumer fraud. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing will begin in Los Angeles on Tuesday on the allegations against West 
Covina Mitsubishi, which is owned by Ziad Alhassen. Alhassen's attorney has 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Developments in City 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen, one of the city's most successful businessmen and developers, built 
the 13-story Eastland Tower, West Covina Village shopping center and other 
smaller developments in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In DMV papers, which list 40 complaints, the dealership is accused of assessing 
illegal charges and fees to customers, of using misleading and false 
advertising, of preparing fraudulent credit applications, inducing customers to 
make purchases based on false information, and late payment of required state 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We occasionally have dealers who are charged with this much, but (the scope of 
this case) is more than we have in most incidents," said DMV spokesman William 
Gengler. "This is a serious case that we are pursuing and we do intend to take 
some action, whether that be suspension or revocation." 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen did not return telephone calls from The Times but his attorney, Steven 
P. Rice, denied the accusations. He asserted they are the result of a 1984 
dispute between Alhassen and the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
Alhassen went to court to force the DMV to allow his dealership to sell 37 
foreign cars which state officials contended did not meet state air quality 
standards. Under a settlement with the DMV and the State Air Resources Board, 
Alhassen was allowed to sell the cars which were refitted to comply with 
emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
"This is no Grand Chevrolet," Rice said, referring to the Glendora car 
dealership formerly run by Eminiano (Jun) Reodica. That dealership went 
bankrupt last year amid DMV allegations of massive fraud and deceit, but has 
since reopened under a federal trustee. "This is a case of the DMV being very 
vindictive over what happened a couple of years ago," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ranked in Top 5 
</P>
<P>
The dealership was Mitsubishi's top retail dealer in the country in 1987, with 
sales of 4,304 cars, and it has often ranked in the top five, according to 
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America. The dealership, which opened in 1983, nets 
the city between $300,000 and $400,000 a year in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get to be No. 1 by ripping off their customers," said Rice, who 
said there has been a "parade of DMV investigators" through the dealership's 
offices following the 1984 battle with the DMV. 
</P>
<P>
"They've come up with a pretty paltry list of accusations after three year's 
work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV began its investigation in the fall of 1987. The complaint was issued 
in December. A state administrative law judge will conduct the hearing, which 
is expected to take several days. If the hearing officer suspends or revokes 
the sales license, Alhassen can appeal to the state New Motor Vehicle Board, 
the only appellate body with jurisdiction over the DMV. Among other duties, it 
regulates car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Etching Fee 
</P>
<P>
Most of the DMV accusations stem from events in 1987 and early 1988, Gengler 
said. He said the agency may consider referring the findings from its 
investigation to the major fraud unit of the county district attorney's office 
for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main allegations involves charging a fee of $190 to $390 to etch an 
automobile's identification number on the windshield. The DMV alleges that the 
dealership falsely told customers that such a procedure was required by state 
law. It also contends that the cost of the etching was often added to the 
contract without the buyer's knowledge. In the DMV's complaint, the charge was 
listed on the contract as a "vehicle identification registration" fee. 
</P>
<P>
Gengler said the DMV did not determine how many customers were allegedly misled 
in such a manner, but said "it was more than a few." He added that the vehicle 
identification number is stamped on each car by the manufacturer and there is 
no legal requirement to have the same number etched on the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the dealership never applied identification numbers to a car or 
charged for the procedure without notifying the customer. He said the 
dealership no longer offers such a service because not enough customers wanted 
it, so it was not profitable. 
</P>
<P>
The dealership is also accused of omitting required information regarding car 
specifications in newspaper advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
During two months in 1987 and two months in 1988, the dealership advertised 
vehicles without listing the make, model, type, manufacturer's identification 
number and a number assigned by the DMV as required by the state Vehicle Code, 
the complaint alleged. The omissions continued after a DMV investigator 
informed the dealership in December, 1987, that the ads must contain such 
information, according to the DMV complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the dealership does not deny that some of the identification numbers 
or numbers assigned by the DMV were omitted from the ads. But he said it is a 
common error made by car dealers because of the high volume of cars sold. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens every day in every paper," he said. "There is no bait and switch 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Another misleading ad, according to the complaint, was published in September, 
1987. In it the dealership advertised that it had 25 Mighty Max pickups and 
"150 others in stock." The DMV alleged that the dealership had only 25 pickups 
on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said the dealership did have 175 pickups on hand. "We've got inventory 
records from the manufacturer," he said. "That's just one of the more blatant 
mistakes in this accusation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the DMV alleges that the dealership fraudulently altered a buyer's 
credit application to Mitsubishi Acceptance Corp. so the customer could receive 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said that Tarek Alhassen, who is listed on state incorporation 
papers as the company's secretary, "told a department investigator that 
altering credit applications to qualify customers for financing was a regular 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Tarek Alhassen had a lawyer present when the statement was taken and 
he never made such a remark. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a total fabrication by the DMV investigator," Rice said. "It seems hard 
to believe that our client would say something like that in the presence of a 
DMV investigator." 
</P>
<P>
Richard W. Bergmann , executive vice president of Mitsubishi Acceptance Corp., 
which finances many of the dealership's sales, said his company has never 
experienced problems or noted discrepancies in credit applications from the 
dealer. "Our relationship has been extremely satisfactory in all respects," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV has also alleged that the dealership misled a San Bernardino couple 
over how long a pickup was covered by the manufacturer's warranty. This was 
done, the DMV alleged, to induce Jeff and Theresa Auman to buy the dealership's 
service contract. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Jeff Auman said the couple bought the $550 service contract 
from the dealer and later discovered that it duplicated the warranty provided 
by Mitsubishi. Auman said that when he questioned the dealership about the 
contract, he was told that the interest rate on his loan from Mitsubishi would 
be raised or the sale invalidated if he stopped payment on the service contract 
or complained to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said Alhassen's employees never misrepresented the service contract, nor 
did they ever threaten to cancel the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'd like to see their license removed," said Auman, who will 
testify at the hearing. Auman also said he was charged a fee to have the 
identification number of his car etched on the vehicle although he had never 
agreed to have that service performed.

<P>
To teen-agers, a large shopping center parking lot near the In-N-Out Burgers on 
Grand Avenue is a hang-out haven. To police, it's a heavy-duty headache. 
</P>
<P>
Not that the affinity of teen-agers for fast-food restaurants is anything new. 
Drive-through restaurants have been attracting young people for decades, 
leading to litter, noise and an occasional fight. 
</P>
<P>
But rarely, authorities say, are such fast-food restaurant problems on the 
scale experienced at In-N-Out Burgers at 1371 Grand Ave., where on warm summer 
nights the boisterous crowd can easily swell to more than 500. Even when the 
mercury dips into the low 40s, as it did one recent Friday night, it's not 
unusual to find 100 or more youths gathered in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The In-N-Out and the adjacent 250,000-square-foot parking lot attract youths 
from nearby cities such as Glendora and Azusa and from as far away as Pomona 
and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd includes honor students and gang members. Some teen-agers are 
introduced to drugs and alcohol there, and through a team of evangelists who 
show up every weekend, others discover Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Violent 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Arnold's from 'Happy Days,' " said Jeff Flores of West Covina who 
frequents the In-N-Out and compared it to the popular teen hangout on the 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
In-N-Outs and other fast-food restaurants elsewhere in the San Gabriel Valley 
are also popular with young people, but few cause police officers as many 
problems. For example, Lt. Ken Jeske of the El Monte Police Department said 
fast-food restaurants in that city attract young weekend cruisers too. But the 
gatherings number no more than 60 people, most of whom belong to various car 
clubs and cause police few problems. 
</P>
<P>
The In-N-Out, however, has developed a rougher and at times violent atmosphere 
in the past year or so. Police say they have spotted skinheads, who espouse 
white supremacist views, and increasing numbers of gang members, including 
Bloods and Crips, two Los Angeles-based gangs whose members identify themselves 
by wearing red or blue. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't see as many faces that you recognize," said Ted Housden, a manager 
at In-N-Out. 
</P>
<P>
Housden used to break up an occasional fight between teen-agers, many of whom 
he knew by name, who were "wanna-bes" and not real gang members, he said. 
Nowadays, Housden doesn't dare jump into the middle of a fight, preferring to 
leave crowd control to two private security guards provided by In-N-Out's 
corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been assaulted," said Walt Gamberale, a security guard. "We've had all 
kinds of threats made at us." 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, the In-N-Out locks its restrooms at 10 p.m., although the 
restaurant is open until 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't close (them) at 10, by 10:30 there is damage," said Housden. Even 
so, five sinks have been replaced in the last six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An Alpha-Beta grocery store, the only other business in the nearby shopping 
center that stays open as late as the restaurant, also locks its restrooms. In 
addition, it blocks access to its storerooms with pallets. 
</P>
<P>
"You learn to live with it," said Mark Nelson, a night manager at Alpha Beta. 
"When it gets really bad, we call the Covina Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Covina police responded to 226 calls at In-N-Out, on a variety of 
complaints from public drunkenness to assault, to a stabbing about three months 
ago that left one victim with a punctured kidney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extra Police Patrols 
</P>
<P>
"There have been arrests there for cocaine and marijuana, for both sales and 
use," said officer Vic Lupu. 
</P>
<P>
To combat the problems at the restaurant, Police Chief John Lentz recently 
sought $10,000 to cover anticipated overtime for extra patrols. The City 
Council, reluctant to spend that much for police coverage of one business, 
called for a closer look at the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"When we respond that often to a particular site, that means we're leaving 
other parts of the city uncovered," said Mayor Bob Low. "It's not fair to the 
rest of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Williams, vice president of operations for In-N-Out, said the company is 
willing to do almost anything to cooperate with city and police officials. The 
company offered to pay for extra police patrols, but the city declined after 
the city attorney said state law prohibits cities from charging for police 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The company will do almost anything short of closing early on weekends, said 
Williams. The restaurant sells about 900 hamburgers on a weeknight, and on 
weekends, sales nearly double. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 1, Lentz and other city officials met with representatives of In-N-Out 
to try to establish a plan of action. The company agreed to set up temporary 
wooden barricades to block off a large section of the parking lot on Friday and 
Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also bolstered its regular two-men private security force at 
In-N-Out with additional guards from its corporate office in Baldwin Park. The 
company, established in 1948, oversees 53 fast-food restaurants in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The city, for its part, agreed to contact Myers Property Management, which 
manages the shopping center, and recommend that speed bumps and special lights 
be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Argenio, a property manager for Myers, said the shopping center's seven 
owners will have to determine whether they are willing to pay for the 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd be looking at absorbing costs to alleviate problems that we're not 
creating," Argenio said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Temporary Barricades 
</P>
<P>
If a one-month trial using the temporary barricades is unsuccessful, the city 
is exploring other options, including declaring the In-N-Out a public nuisance 
and restricting its business hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel we are a public nuisance," said Williams. "It's not just 
In-N-Out. It's the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot also serves a variety of retail and service shops and anchor 
stores, including Builder's Emporium, Clarks Drugs and the 24-hour Alpha Beta 
supermarket. In-N-Out, which faces Grand Avenue, is surrounded on three sides 
by the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning about 10 p.m. one recent Friday, a steady stream of cars and small 
pickup trucks rolled into the parking lot. The drive-through lane was quickly 
filled. Some youths headed for the In-N-Out's warm dining room where they order 
what many of the customers described as "great food." 
</P>
<P>
The Double-Double, a made-to-order, double cheeseburger that is In-N-Out's 
hallmark is a favorite with the teen-agers. As the night wears on and security 
officers periodically clear the parking lot to keep the crowd at a manageable 
size, there is usually a run on french fries and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High School Students 
</P>
<P>
Even though the night air was chilly enough to set teeth chattering, a growing 
number of teen-agers begin clustering around their cars, talking, shivering and 
checking out the action in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Students from at least 10 San Gabriel Valley high schools congregate at the 
In-N-Out, and there is rivalry between the schools, said Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't start anything," said Brian Stevenson, 17, of Glendora. But if anyone 
did pick a fight, he said he would "just start swinging." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, two or three shoving and shouting matches erupted. Stevenson and 
his friends looked on. 
</P>
<P>
"The cops are here!" someone shouted. Stevenson and his friends piled into 
their cars and left. 
</P>
<P>
The shoving matches turned into a brawl involving 25 youths. Three squad cars 
arrived and officers begin breaking up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Afraid of Fights 
</P>
<P>
Suzie Crowe and Kristine Beckstrom, both 16, said they weren't afraid of the 
periodic fights and they said their parents do not worry about their hanging 
out at the In-N-Out. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't tell them about the fights," said Beckstrom. She said there is no 
problem "as long as I'm not the one who is in the fight."

<P>
The In-N-Out is also popular stop for a group of evangelists from Faith 
Community Church in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of people here," said David Dicken, 25, of Covina. "They are 
young. We want to reach high school kids." They approach the youngsters 
individually, when they can. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go up to five people, they are rebellious," said Dicken. "If you talk to 
one or two at a time, they are more receptive." 
</P>
<P>
Dicken said he used to hang out at the In-N-Out when he was a teen-ager. "I got 
into fights," said Dicken. "I smoked pot and drank. I tried cocaine." Then his 
mother led him to Christianity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Christian Rap Tapes 
</P>
<P>
Dicken and Curtis Hansen talk to teen-agers at the In-N-Out and sometimes hand 
out Christian rap and heavy metal cassette tapes as an alternative to those 
with satanic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Valdez, who said he started using drugs at 13, was one who welcomed their 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 19 and have no future," Valdez told Dicken and Hansen over a soda at the 
In-N-Out. "You guys have a lot of guts for coming out here." 
</P>
<P>
At close to midnight, a caravan of cars roared into the parking lot. "We 
usually come here because after the parties where do you go?" said Richard 
Rodriguez, 21, a college sophomore. "Glendora breaks up at 9, Covina at 10, San 
Dimas at 10:30," he said, referring to parties in those cities. 
</P>
<P>
At 1:45 a.m., the crowd was nearly gone. Doug Schiess, an In-N-Out employee, 
walked through the lot with a large garbage bag, picking up beer bottles, cans, 
and paper bags. 
</P>
<P>
By morning, a street sweeper will have scraped the lot clean, leaving little 
evidence of the boisterous night.

S. EL MONTE TO CONSIDER BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Alarmed by a statewide increase in shooting deaths involving semiautomatic 
weapons, city officials plan to introduce an ordinance to restrict or ban the 
sale of military-style assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council adopts a ban, the city will join at least six others in 
California that have prohibited the sale and possession of assault rifles. 
Congress and the state Legislature are also considering similar proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the city's five council members have already announced they will 
support some kind of regulation of assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The rash of legislative efforts to ban such weapons comes in the wake of last 
month's murder spree in Stockton, where a man with an assault rifle sprayed a 
schoolyard with gunfire, killing five children and wounding 29 others. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance is scheduled to be discussed at a council meeting 
Thursday, one week after city officials and a San Gabriel Valley community 
group asked a gun distributing firm based in the city to voluntarily halt the 
sale of such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assault Rifle Importer 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group, East Valleys Organization, said that Federal Ordinance Inc. 
is the nation's eighth largest importer of military assault rifles, according 
to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, members of the citizens group, city officials and Congressman 
Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) held a press conference in front of the 
firearms company at 1443 Potrero Ave. Group members asked to meet with company 
officials to request a voluntary sales ban. 
</P>
<P>
Berton Brenner, president of Federal Ordinance, declined to meet the group 
outside because he "did not want to make a statement in public," said Carol 
Popp, an employee. 
</P>
<P>
Popp said Brenner offered to meet with three representatives in his office, but 
the group turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
Limiting a meeting to three representatives was unacceptable, said Father 
Joseph Greeley of Epiphany Catholic Church in South El Monte. He said such a 
small group would not be representative of the organization's large and diverse 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Popp declined to answer other questions. 
</P>
<P>
East Valleys Organization is a network of 12 San Gabriel Valley church 
congregations. A spokeswoman said the group represents 33,000 families. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Art Olmos said he proposed the ordinance even before he realized 
that Federal Ordinance was located in the city or that East Valleys 
Organization wanted the company to impose a voluntary ban. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prompted by Shooting 
</P>
<P>
Olmos said the recent shooting death of a friend's nephew prompted him to take 
action. He said he was also alarmed by news reports about deaths involving 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ignacio Gracia said he supports a ban partly because he has two sons 
who, as sheriff's deputies, are often exposed to assault weapons on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"My sons tell me those things will go through their protective vests," said 
Gracia. "I don't want the same thing that happened in Stockton to happen in our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Al Perez said he is not worried that an ordinance banning assault rifles 
may be challenged in court by groups such as the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to test it," said Perez. 
</P>
<P>
In Monterey Park, officials have asked Assistant City Atty. Stephanie Scher to 
investigate banning the sale of semiautomatic assault weapons. A resident, Irv 
Gilman, broached the subject during last Monday's City Council meeting. In 
response, Mayor Barry L. Hatch and other council members asked Scher to study 
the legal issues involved in the city adopting such an ordinance.

A LAUGHING MATTER; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA EXTENSION OFFERS COURSES ON WAYS OF FINDING AND USING HUMOR TO EASE 
STRESS, COPE WITH ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The students in the lecture hall at UCLA's Franz Hall were asked to pair off 
and face each other. With their eyes closed and holding hands, they were told 
to think about someone who causes them a lot of stress. 
</P>
<P>
As some students' hands began to sweat and others tensed, they were instructed 
to picture themselves walking up to that person. 
</P>
<P>
"Get as close to that person as you can without touching them," the instructor 
said. He paused a moment. "And now, on the count of two, drop a cream pie down 
their shorts." 
</P>
<P>
As the students broke out in laughter, their sweaty palms dried, their grips 
relaxed and nervousness disappeared. Instructor Bob Basso explained that the 
point of the exercise was to show that there is a correlation between a 
person's physical and mental state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laughter Over Stress 
</P>
<P>
"Your thinking can change bodily functions," Basso said. "If you are laughing, 
you cannot be stressed out." 
</P>
<P>
How to find and use humor in everyday life is the focus of this UCLA Extension 
course, which is the first class in a new sequential curriculum for 
professional training in the art, craft and therapy of comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The introductory class, called Funny Bone, is an eight-week course that costs 
$195 and meets Tuesday nights from 7 to 10 p.m. through March 14. 
</P>
<P>
Two other courses, Performing Stand-Up Comedy ($350) and Improvisational Comedy 
Workshop ($350), are also offered. Additional courses are being developed and 
will be offered this fall. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Extension is the continuing education arm of the university. It receives 
no state tax money and is supported by student enrollment fees. 
</P>
<P>
A university curriculum in comedy may be unusual, but Basso said it may be the 
way of the future as more people turn to comedy for relief. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA Extension has always been on the cutting edge of every new trend," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Steve Allen, a recent guest speaker in the class, said that in a 
magazine article he wrote in the 1950s, he observed that there were about 50 
American comedians in show business. Today, he said, there are about 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for that particular mushroom growth in the professionally funny 
population is that this is the first generation in history that has been 
brainwashed with comedy literally from the cradle," Allen said. "In the old 
days, 50 years ago, you could hear Jack Benny on the radio or see Bob Hope in a 
funny movie. 
</P>
<P>
"But it wasn't morning, noon and night. Now, there's comedy available as soon 
as you get up in the morning and turn on the set. You can watch (Jackie) 
Gleason reruns all day or Lucy (Lucille Ball), or whatever . . . you want. 
There's cable, there's concerts, there's movies, and the young people want to 
get into that. 
</P>
<P>
"Humor is by no means something trivial. Did you ever notice how much they pay 
comedians? Much more than presidents and Nobel Peace Prize winners. It's a 
marketable skill and a very rare one." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Basso thought most of his students would be people pursuing careers 
in comedy. But he found that about 90% of his class are people simply looking 
to incorporate humor into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society has never been more stressed out, more confused than now," said 
Basso, an actor and comic who formed Laughter Therapy and Light Management, a 
consultant service designed to help business managers lighten their management 
style. "All these comedy clubs are not popping up for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we have more comedy that is self-effacing. People are talking about 
personal matters. We are making fun of it because if we take it seriously, 
we'll go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Therapeutic Effect 
</P>
<P>
The therapeutic effect of comedy can also be used in treating physical 
illnesses, Basso said. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent session of Funny Bone, guest speakers included comedians Allen, Sid 
Caesar and Bill Dana, who have all spoken and written books on humor and 
health. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an overlapping between what might seem purely mental factors on the 
one hand and purely physical on the other," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other guest speakers that night were Dr. Malin Dollinger, an oncologist who 
believes in the therapeutic uses of humor, and Dr. Harold Benjamin, who heads a 
support group for cancer patients called the Wellness Community in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Dollinger said he rarely tells jokes but that often patients do need a release 
from the anxiety of their illnesses. He related a situation in which humor was 
needed: 
</P>
<P>
"This woman with cancer came into my office and was very upset because she 
dropped her cancer medication into a trash compactor. This was a life or death 
situation in her mind. She didn't realize that she could just get more pills. 
</P>
<P>
"I very quickly assessed that I needed to say something to break the anxiety. I 
told her I had bad news and good news. The bad news is that you've lost your 
pills and now you'll have to get new ones. The good news is your trash 
compactor will never get cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said there is probably more laughter in his Wellness Community than in 
"most places you know." 
</P>
<P>
"Laughter is simply a catch-all phrase for pleasant emotions," he said. "To 
evoke a pleasant, relaxation state enhances physical well being." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Therapeutic Effects 
</P>
<P>
Laura Owens, who had two successful operations for breast cancer, said: "The 
laughter makes you feel better and relaxed. It counteracts the unpleasantness." 
</P>
<P>
Another cancer patient, Mary Ann Simon, who lost a breast to cancer, said humor 
has helped her deal with her situation. "I really find that it energizes me," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon is enrolled in both the Funny Bone and stand-up comedy classes at UCLA 
Extension. "I want to laugh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But humor is not only therapeutic for people with physical ailments. Some 
students in Basso's class said they just want more humor in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted at least one night of humor in my life, and it has been more than I 
expected," said Beverly Lewis of West Los Angeles, a bank trust officer. 
</P>
<P>
"Banks are very unfunny places," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I would be a comedian, but I really hope I can put the humor in 
my everyday life," said Irene Bosco of Van Nuys, who is in real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Lila Alexander of Los Angeles said simply: "I want to laugh a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Basso said he doesn't care why people want to laugh, only that they do want to 
laugh and that they start by learning to laugh at themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There is only one therapeutic use of humor," he said. "If you can't learn to 
make fun of yourself, you will never have any true, consistent practical humor 
skills. You reduce the threat of everyone else when you make fun of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
And to make his point, he had his students stand up, touch the tip of their 
noses with their right hand, with their left hand grab the earlobe of the 
person to their left, and in a loud voice repeat: 
</P>
<P>
"I will stop taking myself so seriously. I will make fun of myself. I will find 
humor in any situation. I will never move an Indian holy man unless absolutely 
necessary for my mental state."

POLICE DEPT. SOUGHT IN WEST HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I submit that it is time for the city of West Hollywood to have its own police 
department -- one that is sensitive and responsive to the needs of all its 
citizens. Of 22 recent complaints of harassment and abusive treatment by 
sheriff's deputies, 21 were determined by the Sheriff's Department to be 
unsubstantiated. No action taken. 
</P>
<P>
What else could we expect from a department run by avowed homophobe Sherman 
Block, who adamantly refuses to recruit lesbians and gay men as deputies, and 
who recently said that gay and lesbian deputies should not come out of the 
closet because departmental "harassment probably would be open and overt"? 
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely inconceivable that in a city where 35% to 40% of the 
population is gay, there is not one openly gay or lesbian law enforcement 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's contract with the city of West Hollywood expires in June, 1990. 
The sheriff says the terms of the contract are not negotiable. "Take it or 
leave it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If the sheriff can't meet our needs, then let's get someone who can. Someone 
with sensitivity to the needs of the lesbian and gay community. How about a gay 
chief of police? 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood's contract with the sheriff costs $8.5 million a year, or about 
30% of the city's $28-million annual budget. According to City Manager Paul 
Brotzman, a West Hollywood police department would cost the city approximately 
$11 million a year. The difference is due to so-called "concessions" the 
Sheriff's Department makes to keep West Hollywood's business, which accounts 
for some 10% of the department's entire annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
In a city where the first official act was to outlaw discrimination based upon 
sexual orientation, our chief law enforcement officer refuses to adopt an 
anti-discrimination policy! In a city that is 35% to 40% gay, our law 
enforcement officers receive no AIDS education other than for their own 
protection, nor do they receive any form of gay sensitivity training. 
Incredible, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, most cities have a formal citizens review commission to guard against 
police abuses. But in West Hollywood, where abusive police treatment is 
rampant, there is no such protection whatsoever. Nor, Sheriff Block vows, will 
there ever be. 
</P>
<P>
Surely the "creative city" can find a way to finance its own police department. 
Another $2 million per year is a small price indeed for even-handed justice. If 
Sheriff Block cannot or will not meet the gay community's demands for fair and 
impartial treatment, then he should get the pink slip come June, 1990.

HOSPITAL OFFICIALS DEFEND DECISION TO CLOSE EMERGENCY ROOMS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY CITE LACK OF MONITORED BEDS, MISUNDERSTANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Officials from two San Gabriel Valley hospitals that received warnings for 
closing their emergency rooms when empty beds were available say they have been 
unfairly criticized by county inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
Greater El Monte Community Hospital and Inter-Community Medical Center in 
Covina received warnings last week after inspectors made spot-checks of their 
emergency rooms in late January. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials said Greater El Monte Community Hospital closed its 
emergency room on Jan. 27 even though there were three empty beds among the six 
in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closed to Ambulances 
</P>
<P>
The inspectors said Inter-Community closed on Jan. 31, although 10 of 13 beds 
in its emergency room were empty. 
</P>
<P>
Both emergency rooms were only closed to ambulance traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey P. Winter, administrator of Greater El Monte Community Hospital, said 
the hospital did nothing wrong in closing its emergency room that day. 
</P>
<P>
Winter said four of the emergency room's six beds are equipped with medical 
monitors and all of the monitored beds were in use. Just before the inspector 
arrived, one monitored bed was vacated. 
</P>
<P>
He said even though there were empty beds, none had the necessary monitors that 
enable the hospital to care for critically ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was done strictly to proper procedure," Winter said "It's absurd to 
accept one more critical patient when you don't have a monitored bed available. 
When those beds are full, we close." 
</P>
<P>
Winter said he intends to ask the county to modify its guidelines to allow 
emergency rooms to close when they run out of monitored beds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Misunderstanding 
</P>
<P>
Duane Carlberg, administrator of Inter-Community Medical Center, said the 
complaint against his hospital was the result of a misunderstanding with the 
county's Medical Alert Center, which is responsible for tracking emergency room 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
Each time a hospital closes its emergency room, it is required to report to the 
center. Carlberg said the nurse responsible for contacting the center was out 
that day and was replaced by a nurse who is usually assigned to the obstetric's 
department. 
</P>
<P>
He said the replacement nurse reported that the "facilities were saturated" and 
"closed to criticals." The nurse meant only that the hospital's critical care 
section, which includes the intensive care and coronary care units, could not 
accept any more patients. 
</P>
<P>
The county, however, thought the nurse meant the entire emergency room was 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a communications problem," Carlberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlberg said the hospital has discussed the problem with its staff and 
clarified the county's closure guidelines to make sure there will be no further 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emergency Room Rules 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Price-Hastings, the county's chief of paramedics and trauma hospitals, 
said the warnings were issued to make sure the hospitals understand the rules 
about closing emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've observed is that there are no deliberate attempts to get around the 
guidelines," she said. "Some hospitals just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
During the county's spot-check, White Memorial Medical Center in East Los 
Angeles and Dominguez Medical Center in Long Beach were also issued warnings 
for closing their emergency rooms when empty beds apparently were available. 
</P>
<P>
The warnings carry no penalty, although Price-Hastings said repeated and 
willful violations could eventually result in the revocation of a hospital's 
state license. 
</P>
<P>
Inspectors also visited Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center in Inglewood, Harbor General/UCLA Medical 
Center in Los Angeles, California Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles and 
Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Harbor City. Those hospitals were legitimately 
closed to ambulance traffic, Hastings said.

8 COMMUNITIES MAY FORM WASTE-MANAGEMENT COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to warnings that the county may soon run out of places to bury its 
trash, officials in Bellflower are recruiting seven neighboring cities to 
devise a plan to handle the voluminous waste generated each day. 
</P>
<P>
The Bellflower City Council's two-man waste management subcommittee has invited 
the cities' officials to join a proposed waste-management commission. 
Councilmen William J. Pendleton and Randy Bomgaars were appointed to the 
subcommittee when it was formed one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
The proposed commission, which would be patterned after a similar group in the 
San Gabriel Valley, would look at a variety of waste-management alternatives, 
such as recycling, waste reduction and the construction of a waste-to-energy 
facility similar to the Long Beach and Commerce solid-waste incinerators, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent that we all are running out of space," Pendleton said in an 
interview at City Hall last week. "It's getting worse. It's right in 
everybody's face and we have to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton and Bomgaars wrote to administrators and council members in Artesia, 
Norwalk, Lakewood, Paramount, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens and Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most pressing issues in American cities today is solid-waste 
management," they wrote in the Jan. 31 letter. "Waste-management issues affect 
us all, and perhaps working together, we can develop a better strategy and plan 
for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Downey and Paramount officials already have expressed an interest 
</P>
<P>
in the Bellflower proposal, said administrative assistant Gonzalo M. Vazquez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rail Line Suggested 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Los Angeles Sanitation Districts estimate that the county's 10 
landfills will be filled by 1992. About 45,000 tons of trash are deposited in 
landfills each day, said Donald S. Nellor, head of the Los Angeles County 
Sanitation Districts' solid-waste management division. That figure is likely to 
increase to 60,000 tons a day in three years, Nellor said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no place for cities to put their trash in the very near future," 
said Nellor, whose agency has suggested a rail line be built to haul trash to 
unoccupied desert areas. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, an outspoken advocate of controversial waste-to-energy technology, 
will attend a waste-management conference in Miami this week to study various 
options to meet the growing trash problem. 
</P>
<P>
The two-day "Resource Recovery" conference, which begins Thursday, is sponsored 
by the National League of Cities, and will be a forum for city officials 
throughout the country to discuss a broad range of waste-management issues and 
problem-solving technology. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, who is a customer service supervisor for Southern California Edison, 
said he would rather see the city fund a waste-to-energy incinerator to reduce 
solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
Waste-to-energy incinerators, such as facilities in Commerce and Long Beach, 
burn tons of municipal garbage and convert the heat into electricity, which is 
bought by the local electric company for resale to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton, whose decisions as a councilman may ultimately benefit Edison, the 
local electric utility, said that he saw no conflict of interest in his 
involvement in the subcommittee. He added, however, that he would resign from 
the subcommittee if City Atty. Maurice F. O'Shea says that there might be a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Although the two facilities have been praised by some city and county officials 
for lowering the amount of solid waste dumped into the county's 10 landfills, 
others have been critical of the plants. They say that waste-to-energy 
technology can pollute the air. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Commerce facility has been cited recently for repeatedly violating 
air pollution limits. The South Coast Air Quality Management District has 
denied the two-year-old facility full operating permits until plant operators 
can reduce emission levels. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the newly opened Southeast Resource Recovery Facility (SERRF) on 
Terminal Island violated AQMD standards for excessive visible emissions during 
testing. In November, a defect in a precast concrete wall caused the city to 
postpone approval of the plant until the problem is corrected. 
</P>
<P>
And two years ago, environmentalists, community leaders and local lawmakers led 
a successful protest against a proposed incinerator in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hattoy, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, said that even the most 
advanced technology cannot fully guarantee that the environment will be 
protected. "It is always the fear that the best technology available doesn't 
always work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hattoy suggested that recycling and waste reduction should be attempted before 
public officials open new landfills or build waste-to-energy facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Considering Options 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton and Bomgaars said they are considering a variety of options as they 
develop a waste-management plan for the city. But each clearly has his own 
philosophy for battling the growing trash problem. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton prefers a waste-to-energy facility over recycling, and has suggested 
that the Puente Hills landfill would be "an ideal spot." The city's disposal 
company, Cal-Sans Inc., now hauls all city trash to the Puente Hills landfill 
in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not as married to recycling as I am waste-to-energy," Pendleton said. The 
major opposition to the technology, he said, stems from ignorance and 
misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are not totally informed about what's going on," Pendleton 
said, referring to the criticism of the Commerce trash incinerator. "A lot of 
opinion (against waste-to-energy technology) is formed through hysteria" over 
small amounts of escaping pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
"There is always a price to pay for technology," Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bomgaars, recognizing that waste-to-energy proposals are politically 
volatile, said he would like the city to focus on "educating the community to 
do more recycling on their own. We would have a very strong start (in lowering 
trash volume) if we can get everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residential Recycling 
</P>
<P>
Bomgaars, a public school teacher, also suggested that the board of directors 
of the Sanitation Districts subsidize the additional cost of curb-side 
residential recycling, which involves separating bottles, aluminum and paper 
for delivery to a recycling plant. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of residential garbage is recycleable, said waste management expert 
Nellor. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that a waste-to-energy plant "is an environmentally sound 
alternative," Nellor said he has suggested that the Bellflower subcommittee 
begin studying the feasibility of recycling residential trash. 
</P>
<P>
He said that a good voluntary recycling program could involve about 40% of the 
city's households. Recycling much of the trash could extend the use of the 
current landfills for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sanitation Districts' proposal to build a rail line to haul trash to 
outlying areas was made at the request of a group of San Gabriel Valley cities, 
which banded together in 1987 to discuss trash problems in that area of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that association, several San Gabriel Valley cities have adopted 
recycling plans that have proven successful, Nellor said. Five cities -- 
Walnut, Arcadia, Duarte, Laverne and Claremont -- have residential recycling 
policies. "Those cities are doing quite well" in lowering trash volume, Nellor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina and San Dimas have similar policies under consideration.

CAL POLY STUDENTS SAMPLE, RATE FOOD THAT MAY BECOME THEIR SCHOOL CAFETERIA FARE

<P>
It was thumbs up for pepperoni and cheese egg rolls, thumbs down for chicken 
tenders. 
</P>
<P>
On the Brian Bickhart scale of 1 to 5, the egg rolls clearly deserved the top 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
And the bite-size pieces of fried chicken called tenders? "They tasted gross," 
said the young gourmand with a grimace. 
</P>
<P>
Bickhart, 18, was one of hundreds of Cal Poly Pomona students who served as 
food critics Wednesday at the Los Olivos Food Fair. It was an opportunity for 
students to try new foods and to help choose what will be on future menus at 
the school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
For the third year in a row, food suppliers were invited to set up booths at 
Los Olivos, the central dining room for 1,200 resident students. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Items Will Be Added 
</P>
<P>
The students sampled and rated the various products. Their surveys will be 
reviewed by the college's food services department, and some items will be 
added to the regular menu. 
</P>
<P>
Previous student favorites added to cafeteria fare include knishes, egg rolls 
and praline ice cream. Also picked have been items for the health-conscious, 
such as bulgur wheat and sugar peas. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Los Olivos was filled with the aroma of chili mingled with a hint 
of stuffed shrimp and pizza. It was lunchtime gridlock as hungry students piled 
plates with food from the 30 vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Standing near a display of fruit pies and brownies, Food Services Director 
George Way said he got the idea for the food fair after reading about an East 
Coast college that held one. Among the 19 campuses in the California State 
University system, he said, Cal Poly Pomona is the only one that sponsors such 
an event. 
</P>
<P>
For Bickhart, an accounting major, the fair was an opportunity to help change 
the "cycle of food" he eats in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, if (normal cafeteria meals) look bad, we just go for cereal. 
That's neutral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Platefuls 
</P>
<P>
"Today is like Thanksgiving," said Mark Lipin, 20. He had devoured three plates 
of food, with no signs of slowing down, and gave high marks to the chimichangas 
and chili. 
</P>
<P>
Some students carried 2-foot loaves of French bread under their arms. Others 
politely asked for strawberries and were given an entire pint container. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the students interviewed preferred spicy ethnic foods, fresh fruit and 
pastries. Over the years, Way said, he has seen an increase in requests for 
fresh seafood and vegetarian and ethnic entrees as students have grown more 
nutritionally conscious. 
</P>
<P>
Student appetites are ferocious, observed Dennis Livingstone of Rudy's Farm, a 
food manufacturer. His booth served 360 sausage- and-biscuit sandwiches, many 
of them second helpings. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to college here, but they never had anything like this," said Jane De 
Bie, a representative from Atlas Horn. She served 600 fruit-juice spritzer 
samples and dozens of muffins and bagels. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of students lined up at the Bentley's Produce display, where wooden 
crates brimmed with flowers, fruits and vegetables. The chocolate-covered 
strawberries went quickly, Bill Bentley said as he opened another crate of 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Quantities 
</P>
<P>
Starving students are no surprise to Way. "For one lunch, we'll use 1,600 
hamburgers and 130 pounds of fries," he said. The dining hall serves an average 
of 3,000 meals a day. In a year, he said, students consume 17,000 gallons of 
milk, 12,500 hot dogs and 35,000 dozen eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Way, a food industry veteran for 30 years, said he always gets requests for 
lobster tails and filet mignon, but those items would break his budget. 
Students get three all-you-can-eat meals for about $7.40 per day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking some pastries back to our room," said Sherrie Chung, 18, stuffing 
her book bag with some extra muffins, pastries and a juice spritzer. 
</P>
<P>
Chung's roommate, Julie Deal, 18, balanced two paper plates covered with 
cheesecake slices and muffins in one hand. In her other hand was a half-eaten 
ice cream sample. "Thank goodness we have a big refrigerator," she said.

PAUL ROBESON: A BIOGRAPHY BY MARTIN BAUML DUBERMAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24.95; 
784 PP.; 0-394-52780-I) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Atheneum in the spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
The life of a black celebrity is perilous enough, but the black celebrity who 
becomes a spokesperson is asking for pure hell. Not only has the outspokenness 
of those regarded as radicals gotten them into trouble, but as Gary Giddins' 
recent book "Satchmo" (Doubleday), revealed, even a non-radical like Louis 
Armstrong could come into conflict with the American secret police for his 
criticisms of Eisenhower's handling of segregation in the South. 
</P>
<P>
If Paul Robeson had fulfilled the role that American society had prepared for 
him -- that of a patriotic token, lecturing the underclass of his time about 
their "slovenly" habits and exhibiting by his efforts that with hard work and 
determination one could achieve anything in this land of opportunity -- he'd 
probably still be around, delighting audiences with his spirituals and playing 
"Othello" in his old age. 
</P>
<P>
But Robeson broke out of his role. He chose to use his celebrity status as a 
platform for speaking out against the injustices of the oppressed all over the 
world, and especially of blacks at home. For his efforts, he was hounded by his 
enemies into physical and mental breakdown; and, in one of those Orwellian 
ironies that black life in America accumulates, this man, who was persecuted 
from the early '40s until his death in 1976, was diagnosed as having a 
persecution complex. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, at the height of America's Cold War hysteria, the State Department 
lifted his passport, lowering an iron curtain on his opportunity to earn a 
living abroad. Not only did J. Edgar Hoover's FBI become part of the Robeson 
family, it seems, devoting more resources to the investigation of one black 
singer,actor and intellectual, during the '40s and '50s, than to investigating 
organized crime, but even the Communist Party sent an informant, posing as a 
bodyguard, to spy on Robeson. Though Robeson was sympathetic to some Communist 
causes, he never joined the Party and was never brought under its discipline. 
He once refused its order that he be silent. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson's father, the Rev. William Drew Robeson, who had escaped from slavery 
in 1850, at age 15, was forced out of his New Jersey ministry and into poverty, 
punished by the white elders of the presbytery for his tendency to speak out 
against social injustice. In later years, when Robeson himself was subjected to 
vitriolic abuse from the press and the government, a family friend would 
comment: "They did it to his father." 
</P>
<P>
Robeson graduated from Rutgers where he excelled as an athlete and in 1921 
married Eslanda Cardozo Goode, whose great-grandfather was Isaac Nunez Cardozo, 
a member of a Spanish-Jewish family, and whose grandfather, Francis Lewis 
Cardozo, was described by Henry Ward Beecher as "the most highly educated Negro 
in America." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Duberman's excessive and voyeuristic detail about Robeson's 
"multiplicity of romantic and sexual encounters," details which degrade an 
otherwise useful, fine and well-researched biography, Robeson and his wife 
remained companions until her death from cancer in 1965. A serious rift between 
the two occurred after the publication of her book, "Paul Robeson, Negro," in 
which she alluded to his affairs and described him as lazy. (Throughout the 
book, whenever there's a dispute between Robeson and his wife about a fact, 
Duberman sides with Essie Robeson.) 
</P>
<P>
A C-student at Columbia Law School, Robeson stumbled into an acting career in 
1920, appearing in some dreadful thing called "Taboo," in which, typically, 
Afro-American religion was subjected to the usual ignorant stereotyping. 
"Taboo" was written by what Duberman describes as a "fashionable young white 
socialite" named Mary Hoyt Wiborg, daughter of a wealthy financier, Frank 
Wiborg. (Throughout his life, Robeson would roam around freely among different 
classes, from the Australian aborigines, whose treatment he bitterly criticized 
during his stay in Australia, to the denizens of the English court.) Though 
Duberman provides testimony from some of the many he interviewed that Robeson 
regretted his lack of acting and singing training, he received high praise for 
his performance. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson would be criticized for playing such trashy roles throughout his 
career. He appeared in "Show Boat," "The Emperor Jones," "Tales of Manhattan" 
and "Sanders of the River" (which Jomo Kenyatta, one of the performers (!), 
praised). Robeson hated his film roles and was evidently duped sometimes by the 
usual promise of control over the script, or perhaps saw himself as paving the 
way for a succeeding generation of black film actors, who he felt would have it 
better (to no avail, since some of today's black actors take roles that make 
Robeson's role in "The Emperor Jones" seem majestic). Even the role of 
"Othello" was demeaning, Shakespeare's Moor being a little more dignified than 
"The Emperor Jones" but still a gullible half-cannibal who constantly berates 
himself for his inferiority to the Venetians and who takes no offense when they 
call him racist names. At any rate, by the 1930s, Robeson had bitterly 
denounced both "Sanders in the River" and "The Emperor Jones." Robeson 
evidently had more freedom when he performed in movies by black film maker 
Oscar Micheaux and in an experimental film entitled "Borderline." One of 
"Borderline's" producers was a founder of modern poetry, and a feminist, Hilda 
Doolittle. In the film, he appeared with his wife, Essie. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson's concert career was as controversial as his film and stage careers. 
Zora Neale Hurston accused him of corrupting the original intent of the folk 
song's creators, and of pandering to white audiences. Others, arguing that he 
limited his range by singing the songs of the black proletariat, urged him to 
attempt "serious" European music. The ever-culturally conservative black middle 
class was offended by his songs and by his politics. Some of the most scorching 
criticisms of his left-leaning views emanated from the black press, but the 
black press didn't have the power to persecute him as relentlessly as the white 
press did. 
</P>
<P>
It was the white press that stirred up violent passions against him for 
appearing in Eugene O'Neill's "All God's Chillun Got Wings" opposite a white 
actress, and it was the white press that created the atmosphere for an ugly 
civil disturbance which took place in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1947, where Robeson 
had gone to perform for a benefit. And it was a white American wire service 
that distorted a key political speech that Robeson made in Paris, a smear that 
led Robeson's enemies to declare open season on him and NBC to ban him from its 
air waves. 
</P>
<P>
It could be said that Robeson was a victim of the experiential difference 
between blacks and whites, a gap which, according to a recent NAACP poll, still 
exists. The black experience, when not ignored, is arrogantly dismissed as the 
"paranoid" imputing of conspiratorial views that aren't there. Based upon his 
often-humiliating experience -- especially in the area of public accommodations 
-- and of his observations about black life in the United States, Robeson's 
version of American political reality was deeply different from that of 
powerful white men in the government, who considered him ornery for pointing 
out that the human rights violations, which they hypocritically condemned 
abroad, also existed at home. He once got into a heated argument with Harry 
Truman in the White House about such contradictions. Truman responded to 
Robeson's un-paranoid plea for anti-lynching legislation by ending the 
interview. Truman later included Robeson in a "gang" that he claimed he'd 
defeated. Eleanor Roosevelt's view of Robeson was similar to Truman's. 
</P>
<P>
Duberman's book indicates that Robeson could have made it easier for himself 
had he recanted his support for the Soviet Union, something that he refused to 
do. His support for the Soviet Union has always baffled many. Robeson was 
warned by Emma Goldman in the 1930s that the Russian Revolution had its cruel 
side. And even after the purges, the Soviet Nazi pact, the invasion of Hungary, 
the revelations about genocide committed by Stalin, Robeson remained loyal, 
shrugging off every criticism of a country he regarded as an ideal, color-blind 
worker's paradise. He must have known, after partying with Khrushchev and his 
friends in their private lodges, that some Communists live much better than 
others. He was himself a cultural nationalist, but apparently took little note 
of the fact that the Soviets had attempted to eradicate the cultures of Latvia, 
Estonia and Lithuania. One wonders how Robeson would have reacted to glasnost, 
perestroika, the appeal for Western capital, the experiments with private 
enterprise, and the mass murders committed by Soviet forces in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Robeson was again permitted to travel abroad thanks to a Supreme Court decision 
in 1958 for which William O. Douglas wrote the majority decision, declaring 
that "The passport division had no right to demand that an applicant sign an 
affidavit concerning membership in the Communist Party." Ill health forced him 
to return to the United States. During the last years of his life, he was 
honored by a generation of civil rights workers whose coming his career had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed attitudes with which his country viewed the career of Robeson -- a 
man both praised and damned in his native land, and a man who had the courage 
to articulate in public ideas most confine to their thoughts -- didn't end at 
his death. Last year, in New York, "A Celebration of Paul Robeson" was held. 
Among the sponsors were American Express, General Electric, ITT, Philip Morris, 
Mrs. Vincent Astor, and The Rockefeller Group.

THE PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY OF MALE HOMOSEXUALITY BY KENNETH LEWES PH.D. (SIMON 
&amp; SCHUSTER:$19.95; 301 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judd Marmor, Marmor is apast president of the American Psychiatric Assn. and 
editor of Homosexual Behavior: A Modern Reappraisal (Basic Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an ironic paradox that many psychoanalysts who profess to be most loyally 
devoted to the theories of Sigmund Freud are nevertheless among the strongest 
advocates of the view that homosexuality per se constitutes a mental disorder. 
Yet Freud himself clearly did not consider it so, stating that it can occur "in 
people who exhibit no other serious deviations from the normal . . . and who 
are indeed distinguished by specially high intellectual development and ethical 
culture" and adding: "Wouldn't that oblige us to characterize as sick many 
great thinkers and scholars of all time, whose perverse orientation we know for 
a fact and whom we admire precisely because of their mental health?" 
</P>
<P>
The author of "The Psychoanalytic Theory of Male Homosexuality," Kenneth Lewes, 
a psychoanalytically trained psychologist, set himself the challenging test of 
reviewing almost every psychoanalytic article and book written about male 
homosexuality. Unhappily, his review has covered a rather dismal record. Almost 
without exception, the early psychoanalysts (and most contemporary ones) who 
wrote about homosexuality made the egregious error of generalizing from small 
samples of emotionally disturbed homosexual patients to the homosexual 
population at large, and (assuming that all homosexuals were essentially alike) 
of filling their pages with stereotypic conclusions about "the homosexual" and 
the "homosexual personality." 
</P>
<P>
But, even worse, not recognizing their own built-in emotional biases, almost 
all of them (with a few honorable exceptions) not only took it for granted that 
homosexual behavior was "unnatural" and needed to be "cured" but sometimes 
commented about their homosexual patients in ways that revealed a shocking 
contempt for them. Thus, Dr. Edmund Bergler, the most important psychoanalytic 
"expert" on homosexuality in the 1950s, wrote: "Homosexuals are essentially 
disagreeable people . . . (displaying) a mixture of superciliousness, false 
aggression, and whimpering . . . subservient when confronted with a strong 
person, merciless when in power, and unscrupulous about trampling on a weaker 
person." In a similar vein, Dr. Charles Socarides, considered one of the 
leading contemporary psychoanalytic authorities on the subject, has written: 
"Homosexuality . . . is filled with aggression, destruction, and self-defeat, 
and is a masquerade of life . . . (involving) only destruction, mutual defeat, 
and exploitation of the partner and the self." 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder that Lewes, at one point, can't help shedding his scholarly 
dispassionateness, exclaiming: "It is shocking that Bergler's colleagues let 
such . . . attitudes go without rebuke. Such intemperance severely compromised 
psychoanalytic discourse about homosexuality . . . and sullied the 
psychoanalytic tradition of sympathy and tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
As Lewes outlines the evolution of psychoanalytic theories about homosexuality, 
he winds his way through an intricate and abstruse maze of often mutually 
contradictory concepts. There are long passages dealing with esoteric 
speculations attributing the origins of homosexuality to the search for the 
lost penis in the father, regression to orality or anality, castration anxiety, 
incest guilt, incomplete separation from the mother, narcissistic 
identifications, and even to "testicular anxiety" and an infantile fear of 
losing feces! Regrettably, Lewes himself contributes to the confusion by 
assuming that there are "different kinds of homosexuality" -- i.e., normal, 
psychotic, borderline, etc., failing to understand that homosexuals can develop 
the same variety of mental disorders that heterosexuals do and that these do 
not constitute different "homosexualities" any more than they do different 
"heterosexualities." 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the 1970s that psychoanalytic formulations about homosexuality 
began to take an entirely new course, with the recognition that not all 
homosexuals were mentally ill, that their love for one another could be as 
fully developed and genuine as that between heterosexuals and that they were 
capable of living stable lives and functioning responsibly and honorably, often 
in positions of high trust. These views were abetted by a number of significant 
new research reports on non-patient homosexual populations, among them a 
classic study by Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a UCLA psychologist, demonstrating that 
careful psychological testing of a group of non-patient homosexuals revealed no 
demonstrable pathology that differentiated them in any way from a matched group 
of heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
Pressures began to develop in the psychiatric community to remove homosexuality 
from its listing as a mental illness in the American Psychiatric Assn.'s 
Official Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. A historic debate ensued within the 
APA, with psychoanalysts leading the polemic on both sides. Irving Bieber, a 
psychoanalyst who had published an influential group-research study of male 
homosexuals in analytic treatment (a study that encountered severe 
methodological criticism because all of the subjects were, a priori, 
emotionally disturbed individuals), and Socarides fought strongly against the 
deletion. Robert Stoller, Richard Green and this reviewer, all from Los 
Angeles, played important roles in urging the change. This view finally 
prevailed when the APA Board of Trustees, in 1973, voted to delete 
homosexuality from the list of mental disorders. Unhappy with this outcome, 
Bieber and Socarides pushed for a national membership referendum on the issue, 
and, to their surprise and chagrin, a majority of the psychiatrists voting 
upheld the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Lewes' book is not one for the general reader. Its greatest appeal will be to 
psychoanalytically-oriented professionals and highly sophisticated lay people. 
His approach is a broad and tolerant one, although he is clearly more 
fascinated with classical Freudian libido theory than are many contemporary 
psychoanalysts, whom he pejoratively labels "revisionists." For the student of 
homosexuality, however, the greatest weakness of the book is its failure to 
give any inkling of the exciting new biological findings about the origins of 
variant sexual orientation -- e.g., the growing body of research evidence that 
a significant proportion of male homosexuals are biologically predisposed at 
birth to become homosexual by virtue of variations in the degree to which they 
have been exposed to circulating male sex hormones during their intra-uterine 
development. These variations, although not causative in and of themselves, 
appear to have a fateful effect on the male child's subsequent temperament, 
life experiences and interpersonal relationships and to favor the development 
of a homosexual orientation. In such children, homosexual inclinations from 
early life on are as "natural" as heterosexual inclinations are to most other 
males and are definitely not a matter of "choice."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A WOLVERINE IS ATTACKING MY LEG: BY TIM CAHILL (VINTAGE / 
RANDOM HOUSE: $8.95)

Why venture down dangerous Himalayan rapids or up 40-story-high underground 
precipices? To stir up enough endorphins to foster a feeling of exhilaration, 
Tim Cahill explains, and to escape inner demons. Cahill's demon was the serial 
killer, which he studied for a book he wrote prior to taking some of the trips 
described in these pages: "Looking inside the mind of a murderer was 
terrifying. . . . In those bad, shaky times, when I realized that one more 
morbid detail, one more sordid fact, would send me screaming around the bend, I 
knew it was time to go out and risk my life for no very good reason." Unlike 
many Gonzo travel adventures, though, these stories are not so obsessed with 
walking on the "razored precipice separating rational behavior from irrational" 
that they lose sensitivity to other people, animals and places. 
</P>
<P>
While Cahill mitigates armchair reader envy through bad puns ("We have always 
depended on the kindness of rangers") and bizarre quips ("In diving . . . you 
get to go around wearing tight rubber suits, and nobody thinks you're weird: 
this is our little secret"), a few of these adventures are better experienced 
than read about. Several pieces, however, are as substantial as they are 
absorbing. "Love and Death in Gorilla Country," for example, is an original, 
insightful look at an old story -- Dian Fossey's work with gorillas in Rwanda. 
Cahill is silly at times (he finds gorilla life to be "incredibly slow moving 
and predictable . . . like 'Dallas' on downers"), but he describes the apes 
vividly (they smell "skunky with a splash of vinegar") and he sensitively 
portrays the political power struggles that doomed Fossey. 
</P>
<P>
An impressive collection, exploring the way the beauty and the darkness of the 
physical world is mirrored in the human psyche. Cahill seeks out stress, 
quoting author Ralph Keyes, "to enjoy the subsequent tranquility . . . . Risk 
is a part of therapy; you can put your life on the line in order to save your 
soul."

Short walk through fields to soft-drink stand where boats wait -- all aboard! 
Creak of rope oarlock. One man pulls the single oar, another poles, a third 
steers, a fourth stands by to relieve the first. High-up shrine, bamboo glade. 
Woodland a cherry tree still in bloom punctuates like gunsmoke. Egret flying 
upstream, neck cocked. Entering the (very gentle) rapids everyone gasps with 
pleasure. The little waves break backwards, nostalgia con moto, a drop of fresh 
water thrills the cheek. And then? Woodland, bamboo glade, high-up shrine. 
Years of this have tanned and shriveled the boatmen. For after all, the truly

cloth; $8.95 paper; 95 pp.). Of this section of the five-part book (including a 
verse-drama), Stephen Yenser writes, in a note for the publisher: "Set mostly 
in Japan, it intertwines narratives of beginnings and endings even as it 
intersperses its prose with hokku in a manner reminiscent of Basho's travel 
journals -- though the delicately managed rhymes set Merrill's cachet upon the 
form." James Merrill, 1988. Reprinted by permission of Alfred A. Knopf. Merrill 
is one of the most celebrated poets in America, having won the National Book 
Award twice, the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle award and,

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: BEN HECHT A BIOGRAPHY BY WILLIAM MACADAMS (CHARLES 
SCRIBNER'S SONS: $22.50) 
</P>

When the advent of sound-on-film and amplification technology forced the entire 
art of cinema to be reevaluated in 1916, Hollywood producers began issuing 
urgent calls to East Coast literati who could take film beyond the sketchy 
plots of the silent era. Ben Hecht's call from Hermann Mankiewicz, 
co-author-to-be of "Citizen Kane," was arguably the most fruitful, for by the 
1930s, Hecht had become his era's highest-paid, most prolific screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
Hecht seemed born to be the consummate entertainer for his culture, this 
diligently researched, affectionate history suggests, for from an early age, he 
shared its fascination with the tragic and the macabre, a spirit lingering from 
the fin-de-siecle era. When a runaway horse struck the streetcar in which 
8-year-old Hecht and his family were riding, killing a man in the seat ahead, 
young Hecht began interviewing the passengers, the ambulance drivers and the 
police. Once home, Hecht's puzzled brother Peter recalled, Hecht "locked 
himself in our bedroom and spent hours writing and rewriting his version of the 
bloody mess -- the commotion, fainting, etceteras." 
</P>
<P>
By his late teens, Hecht had turned his obsession into a profession, becoming 
the most yellow of journalists. Having none of the police contacts necessary to 
rout out lurid stories, he simply made them up, convincing a police captain to 
pose, gun in hand, on his boat (his paper's headline the next day: "Police 
Pursue River Pirates") and his landlady to pose beside a small trench and some 
broken crockery ("The Great Chicago Earthquake"). Ironically, Hecht's first 
film, "Underworld," won the first "screen story" Academy Award in 1929 for its 
realism; Hecht gave the gangsters at the center of the film human quirks, such 
as a tick in the right hand, and dressed them not in turtleneck sweaters and 
cloth caps, a dime novel stereotype, but in sophisticated business suits. 
</P>
<P>
While "Ben Hecht" is an absorbing chronicle of a compelling man, MacAdams' 
focus on Hecht's cinematic work overlooks some of the literary influences that 
shaped Hecht's writing style, such as that of the French naturalist writer 
Joris-Karl Huysmans, and mentions Hecht's early, darkly cynical novels, such as 
"Erik Dorn," only in passing. MacAdams does, however, examine Hecht's most 
significant literary attempt at optimism, "A Book of Miracles," where one 
character, a solitary ant, manages to look beyond the "froth of hunger and ego" 
of human society and recognize that while "we have come forward only a small 
way, it is a noble inch we have moved."

HOW CENTRAL WAS ANTI-SEMITISM TO NAZISM?; 
</P>
<P>
WHY DID THE HEAVENS NOT DARKEN?: THE FINAL SOLUTION IN HISTORY BY ARNO J. MAYER

Darkness; Christian Rescue of Jews in Nazi-Occupied Poland (Oxford University 
Press) and other works.

<TEXT>
<P>
Efforts at understanding the "Final Solution" the Nazi term for the 
annihilation of the Jews -- have given rise to two polar positions, the 
intentionalist and the functionalist. Briefly, the intentionalists see a direct 
line between Hitler's anti-Semitic proclamations and the introduction of 
anti-Jewish measures, including the Final Solution. In contrast, the 
functionalists maintain that in part the Final Solution emerged out of a series 
of improvisations and as a reaction to existing conditions. Partly because no 
written directive by Hitler was ever found ordering the systematic annihilation 
of Jews, the functionalists see no direct connection between the anti-Semitic 
proclamations by leaders of the Third Reich and the Final Solution. 
Specifically, too, they assume that the Final Solution emerged as a reaction to 
German military disappointments on the Russian front. Unlike the 
intentionalists, the functionalists think that, as an official policy, the 
Final Solution was established not before but during the Russian campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly innocent, the intentionalist and functionalist arguments may have 
significant political overtones. The functionalists, by perceiving the Final 
Solution, in part, as a haphazard reaction to existing conditions, diminish its 
importance and dilute the responsibility for its establishment and 
implementation. Such a position may play into the hands of some revisionists 
who deny not only the significance, but also the very existence of the Final 
Solution. 
</P>
<P>
It is indeed a matter of historical record that before the Nazi government 
began to concentrate on the persecution of Jews it was busy murdering and 
placing into the concentration camps thousand of Germans whom it perceived as 
actual or potential political opponents. Later on, the same government applied 
equally oppressive measures toward native populations in newly conquered 
territories. Such measures were introduced with special ruthlessness to Poland 
where the first targets of destruction were Polish elites rather than Jews. 
Thousands of Poles were murdered while additional thousands were incarcerated 
in concentration camps. In fact, at first, most of the Auschwitz inmates 
belonged to the Polish elites. In the end, the Nazis succeeded in decimating 
the Polish intelligentsia. 
</P>
<P>
Such criminal governmental activities created a proper climate for the 
annihilation of Jews without, however, establishing causal connections between 
them. Direct causal links are suggested by other developments. One of them is 
the emergence of the Einsatzgruppen, SS units whose aim it was to kill 
civilians in the soon-to-be-conquered Russian territories. The training of 
these groups began in March and April, 1941. After the invasion of Russia on 
June 22, 1941, the Einsatzgruppen and their collaborators succeeded in 
murdering an estimated 1.5 million civilians, about 90% of whom were Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Other measures in support of the Final Solution were also being introduced. On 
July 31, 1941, Goering authorized Heydrich to prepare a plan for the "total" 
solution of the Jewish question. On Oct. 23, 1941, Himmler issued an order 
forbidding Jewish emigration from German-held territories. Approximately at 
that time work began on the first Jewish death camps at Belzec and Chelmno. On 
Nov. 29, 1941, invitations went out for the Wannsee conference, one of whose 
aims was to coordinate Jewish deportations from across Europe. Originated in 
the highest echelons of the Nazi regime, these moves suggest a 
well-orchestrated plan of action that set in motion the Final Solution. 
</P>
<P>
Arno J. Mayer's "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?" while presenting a thorough 
historical account of the Final Solution touches upon some of the issues 
contained in the intentionalist-functionalist debate. Offering a lucid 
description of the complex historical events that led into World War I and 
World War II, and relying on extensive knowledge of European history, the 
history of the Third Reich and the history of the Final Solution, the book 
deals with the intricate dynamics of these complex events rather than their 
structures. Describing the processes of important ideological and behavioral 
currents and counter currents, the author offers a fascinating account of one 
of the most important chapters in human history. 
</P>
<P>
But how does this book fit into the intentionalist-functionalist debate? 
</P>
<P>
Mayer writes that: "Anti-Semitism was a cardinal postulate of the 
Weltanschauung which fired the rise of the Nazi movement as well as the 
consolidation of the Nazi regime and its drive for the mastery of Europe. But 
although anti-Semitism was an essential tenet of the Nazi worldview, it was 
neither its foundation nor its principal or sole intention. Anti-Semitism was 
one of several central creeds of an essentially syncretic ideology, the others 
being social Darwinism, the geopolitics of eastern expansionism, and 
anti-Marxism. While these four articles of faith were closely enmeshed and 
eventually crystallized into an indivisible belief system, within this system 
their position and importance in relation to each other varied with time, 
place, and circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
The author is correct in asserting that anti-Semitism was not the only Nazi 
creed, and he elucidates these different components with accuracy. He is also 
right in assuming that the importance of these creeds " . . . varied with time, 
place, and circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
Having said that, Mayer, in a somewhat ambiguous way, shows how anti-Semitism 
became ingrained in other Nazi creeds when he writes that: "Anti-Semitism 
permeated Hitler's worldview and project. It was also consonant with his 
interpretation -- and execration -- of the corruption of the modern world. But 
while Hitler condemned the Jews as the chief disease-carrying poisoners and 
parasites of contemporary society, he struck out through them against the 
processes and forces of emancipation of modernization, which for him were the 
ultimate source of pollution. Indeed, if Hitler's worldview had an epicenter, 
it was his deep-seated animosity toward contemporary civilization, and not his 
hatred for Jews, which was grafted onto it." 
</P>
<P>
In another place, Mayer says that: "The Nazi leaders stressed that there was, 
of course, no fighting Marxism and Bolshevism without understanding them, which 
meant facing up to the pivotal role of the Jews. All of Europe needed to 
realize that, having invented the Bolshevik madness, the Jews were 
masterminding it from Moscow in their bid for world domination." 
</P>
<P>
From these statements, and others, it appears that the Nazi government blamed 
the Jews for "Marxism," "Bolshevism," "Modernism," and a host of other societal 
ills. Since the elimination of these ills assumed a pivotal position in 
Hitler's overall program, it follows that the elimination of Jews who were 
defined as responsible for these ills was also a central aim of the Third 
Reich. 
</P>
<P>
Once opportunities for destroying the Jews presented themselves, Hitler and 
other Nazi leaders took advantage of them. The war with Russia was one of those 
opportunities. Moreover, historical evidence shows that eventually the 
annihilation of Jews took precedence over the conduct of the war. Jews 
continued to be murdered en mass even though they were a potentially valuable 
economic commodity, and when the trains transporting them to their death were 
needed by the military. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the facts, but facts seldom speak for themselves. The 
enormity and complexity of the Final Solution demand more study and more 
deliberation. "Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?" meets both of these 
requirements and becomes a welcome addition to the existing literature.

BRINGING CHAOS OUT OF CHAOS; 
</P>
<P>
THE ECONOMICS OF CHAOS ON REVITALIZING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BY ELIOT JANEWAY 
(TRUMAN TALLEY BOOKS/ E.P. DUTTON: $22.50; 352 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Conot, Conot writes about economics and politics for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What iconoclastic gadfly Eliot Janeway means by the economics of chaos is 
Reagonomics, and he offers a whirlwind of prescriptions to cast out the ills 
that he perceives. Some of them seem simplistic and many are likely to raise 
hackles among more orthodox economists, regardless of their ideological 
persuasion. For the lay reader, the book offers a stomach-churning 
roller-coaster ride of highs and lows, twists and turns and loop-the-loops that 
may have him hanging on for dear life. 
</P>
<P>
Janeway postulates that the problems of the economy are due to a parallelogram 
of eight forces and that "they invite solutions in pairs": hence the four-sided 
figure. This comprises 1) agricultural exports and oil imports; 2) the budget 
deficit and the trade deficit; 3) Social Security and the growth of the 
underground economy that results from regressive taxation; 4) defense and 
social programs. 
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit, Janeway asserts, is the product of lagging agricultural 
exports and excessive oil imports. More direct intervention than the 
devaluation of the dollar, which has failed to produce anticipated results, is 
needed. We should pay for oil not in dollars, but with farm exports; in other 
words, resort to barter. To stimulate domestic oil production, we should put a 
quota of 50% of the U.S. market on oil imports, paying $18 a barrel to domestic 
producers and $5 to foreign. Janeway cites U.S. sugar quotas as precedent but 
fails to mention the devastating effect that these have had on the economies of 
such nations as the Philippines or their inflationary impact in the United 
States. As for what oil-producing nations would do with the mountains of U.S. 
food that they would have no use for, Janeway suggests that they could dispose 
of them, in more or less philanthropic fashion, in populous Muslim countries. 
</P>
<P>
By paying for fuel imports with agricultural commodities, the farm sector would 
be stimulated and federal subsidies reduced. Increased oil production would 
revitalize the Southwest and tax revenues would be enhanced. Both the trade and 
budget deficits -- another pair cemented together as a facet of the 
parallelogram -- would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
An additional benefit, he conceives, would be "encouraging more people to buy 
more cars and trucks, and to use them more, especially for longer-distance 
commuting. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But no mention of what this would do to air pollution, the additional strain 
that would be put on the deteriorating highway system, or the probability that 
a portion of those burgeoning cars and trucks would be imported and thereby 
exacerbate the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Janeway is long on sweeping proposals but short on details of 
administration or practical implementation. Free trade is moribund, he posits, 
and we should reemphasize reciprocity -- unrestricted imports of any product 
would be limited to 25% of the U.S. market. It is a nationalist-Populist 
approach, stressing what is good for America, but giving short shrift to the 
effect on other economies; and it is hardly likely to be swallowed without some 
serious regurgitation by foreign nations. Even if it did not precipitate, as 
would be likely, a trade war, it might well produce a trade lock that would be 
just as bad. 
</P>
<P>
Janeway's position is that the U.S. market is too important and the U.S. 
economy and financial clout are too great for us to concern ourselves with the 
possibility of retaliation -- a confidence that seems misplaced in the age of 
an integrated European community that is more than a match for the United 
States. Indeed, he sees the Soviet Union as a virtual client state of the 
United States, as well as hostage to Western Europe's "grid of nuclear power 
plants. Any shoot-out over Western Europe would scorch Russia from the skies 
with a giant-size Chernobyl reaction more deadly and more difficult to defend 
against than any launched by Genghis Khan, Napoleon, or Hitler on land." It is 
an odd view that a major deterrent to a nuclear holocaust would be the effect 
on the Soviet Union of radiation released by devastated commercial nuclear 
plants in other nations; but this is an odd kind of book. It fades in on 
Alexander Hamilton and focuses on Thorstein Veblen, the turn-of-the-century 
prophet who predicted the effect of the technological revolution on society and 
economy. It surveys a progression of economic theorists and so proffers a 
panorama of political economic history. 
</P>
<P>
But, repeatedly, Janeway takes the reader on detours that bewilder more than 
they enlighten. Not only do we get Albert Einstein, we are offered 
disquisitions on Dmitry Mendeleyev (the deviser of the periodic table), 
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (who suggested "twin screw propellers rotating in 
opposite directions"), and Ernst Mach (an Austro-Hungarian physicist and 
ballistics expert who has given his name to the terminology of supersonic 
speeds). In such roundabout fashion, Janeway eventually concludes: "Both the 
manufacturing and the services sectors of the American economy travel on 
wings." Economic revitalization, he says, "is bound to start with the 
aeronautical segment of her political economy. . . . Fear of flying is fatal to 
the economy, and so is failure to organize aeronautics. . . . The need to land, 
on Earth and in space, will outpace the growth of landing fields." Ergo, we 
should have fewer airports and more VTOL -- vertical takeoff and landing -- 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
By such digressions, Janeway detracts from the overview of the American economy 
and its future direction that he intends to present. But then, perhaps, the 
corollary to "The Economics of Chaos" has long been the chaos of economics.

A STAR IS RESTORED;

<P>
A STAR IS BORN THE MAKING OF THE 1954 MOVIE AND ITS 1983 RESTORATION BY RONALD 
HAVER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $24.95; 300 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald Haver's "A Star Is Born: The Making of the 1954 Movie and its 1983 
Restoration" is quite simply one of the best books ever written about 
Hollywood. If it had stuck strictly to its subject, as stated in its subtitle, 
it would be fascinating and invaluable as a record of the fate of one of the 
American cinema's most cherished films maudits. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, it's much more than that. Through an exceedingly detailed -- yet brisk 
and succinct -- account of the film's troubled production, Haver, the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art's longtime film programmer, gives a clear idea of 
the workings of a major studio in the twilight of Hollywood's Golden Era. He 
even sets the stage by evoking not only the motion picture industry but the 
city of Los Angeles and the country at large at the time "A Star Is Born" was 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, he illumines the technical aspects of film making by bringing alive 
a cast of real-life Hollywood characters more vivid than even those in the film 
they were making. At the forefront are Judy Garland, for whom the film was to 
be a comeback after a troubled four-year absence from the screen; director 
George Cukor, celebrated for his deftness in guiding star-actresses; and Jack 
Warner, who gambled a near-unprecedented $4,970,000 of his studio's money on 
the belief that the public still loved Garland. There is even the shadowy 
presence of a Burbank Studios film editor, said to have some key missing 
footage from the film's uncut version; sure enough, it turned out that he did 
-- when he was arrested for the illegal possession of hundreds of cans and 
boxes of film! 
</P>
<P>
It was Garland's new husband, producer Sid Luft, who had the inspired idea of 
starring his wife in a musical remake of one of Hollywood's most popular movies 
about itself. Its sure-fire plot, as all movie lovers know, has to do with an 
alcoholic matinee idol (Norman Maine) who discovers and falls in love with the 
talented, unknown Esther Blodgett, soon to be given the nom de film Vicki 
Lester. Norman and Vicki marry, but as she soars to stardom, he hits the skids. 
Janet Gaynor and Fredric March were the original Norman and Vicki. (Cukor 
himself had directed an even earlier variation on the plot, the 1932 "What 
Price Hollywood?" starring Constance Bennett, Joel McCrea and Lowell Sherman.) 
Moss Hart wrote the new script and Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin contributed 
the songs, including the famous "The Man That Got Away." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Haver directed the 1983 restoration effort on behalf of the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, he said that there were no real villains 
in the unhappy fate of the film that resulted in its being trimmed by 27 
minutes from its original 181-minute running time. Yet Haver makes it clear 
that "A Star Is Born" was a risky venture from the beginning. First of all, 
there was Garland, caught up in her barbiturate and amphetamine dependence that 
inevitably resulted in many absences from the set. Then there was Luft, who, 
while clearly invaluable in holding his wife together, had no experience in 
producing such an elaborate film. And then there was the costly decision, early 
in production, to scrap everything and shoot in the new CinemaScope format. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us who love the movie love the 18-minute "Born in a Trunk" sequence 
written by Leonard Gershe and Roger Edens and directed by choreographer Richard 
Barstow. It's a film-within-the-film, inserted by Luft, Garland and Jack 
Warner, that tells of its heroine's birth into vaudeville and emergence into a 
star that has direct parallels to Garland's own life, but it does bring the 
overall story to a halt, and it did pave the way for Warner to yield to the 
demands of exhibitors faced with less-than-thrilling box-office receipts. (In 
major cities, Haver discovered, the uncut version started screening at 8 a.m., 
and in the evening it was shown at the inconvenient hours of 6:30 and 10 p.m.) 
Cukor was outraged that he and Hart had not been allowed to "sweat out" 20 
minutes that he claimed "would never have been missed." Most of the cuts are 
near the beginning of the film and contain scenes crucial to the development of 
Vicki and Norman's relationship. Haver suggests, credibly, that the aborted 
version could have cost Garland, Mason and others the Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Warner regrettably did not let Cukor make the cuts that everyone 
seemed to finally agree were necessary, he does not emerge as the stereotypical 
villainous studio head but a thoroughgoing, no-nonsense professional prepared 
to take considerable risks -- and even battle with his brothers to do so -- but 
also quick to cut losses. The Judy Garland that emerges here seems tragically 
doomed -- gallant, rarely temperamental but too often absent, incredibly 
courageous and giving, but finally too fragile to be expected to resume the 
rigors of full-time movie making. As for Cukor, the book offers the best 
portrait of the director yet -- mercurial, witty and -- to use his own favorite 
word of praise -- tough. 
</P>
<P>
Among Haver's primary sources were production designer Gene Allen, assistant 
directors Earl Bellamy and Russ Llewellyn and the late James Mason, who was the 
perfect Norman Maine but was far from the first choice for the role. (That was 
Laurence Olivier, followed by Richard Burton, Tyrone Power and Cary Grant. 
Grant actually read for Cukor, who believed he would never reveal himself on 
the screen in the way the role of Norman demanded.) Some of the most 
pleasurable moments in the book come from Allen and Bellamy's descriptions of 
the truly collaborative art of film making, in particular that of the crew 
rising to the challenges presented by the wide CinemaScope image. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the book is a veritable detective story as Haver starts 
searching for the missing 27 minutes, which took him into the Warner vaults, 
where he did find the uncut sound track but eventually had to settle for 
filling out an elusive seven minutes with stills. Even the task of restoration 
climaxed on a moment of high drama; less than 24 hours before Cukor was to see 
the first reassembled portion of the film, he died suddenly of heart failure in 
January, 1983, at age 83. As Haver describes the arduous, tantalizing process 
of the restoration, filled with nearly as many disappointments as happy 
surprises, his book becomes a timely plea for the cause of film preservation. 
(If only Jack Warner had preserved all the cuts from the original negative 
instead of melting them down for the silver content, a lamentably standard 
Hollywood practice for decades.) 
</P>
<P>
In "A Star Is Born: The Making of the 1954 Film and Its 1983 Restoration," 
Haver admirably clarifies the intricate, often high-pressure task of big-scale 
Hollywood film making, but his primary accomplishment is making the most 
dramatic and persuasive case imaginable for the need to preserve our film 
heritage.

A LOOK AT THE ENEMY: CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
THE DISEASE 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 types of cancer. Most fall into two categories: 
sarcomas or carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
Carcinomas are cancers of the type of tissue that forms skin and the lining of 
major organs. Eighty percent to 90% of all cancers are carcinomas. 
</P>
<P>
Sarcomas are cancers of the connective tissue, such as bone and cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in three main ways: They reproduce 
faster, migrate to other parts of the body and don't have specialized 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 1 million Americans will be found to have cancer this year. 
About half a million will die from it. 
</P>
<P>
For all cancers combined, the number of new cases each year increased 10.7% 
between 1973 and 1985, the latest year for which statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic increase between 1973 and 1985 was for melanoma of the skin, 
which increased 60%. Excessive sun exposure is the primary cause. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest decline between 1973 and 1985 was for cervical cancer, which 
dropped 35%. Early detection and greater use of Pap smears are credited. 
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and the 
major cause of cancer death. Most lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking. 
Among women, lung cancer incidence increased 81% between 1973 and 1985. For 
men, it increased 14.3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE SURVIVAL RATE 
</P>
<P>
The rate of people who survive cancer and are disease-free five years after the 
diagnosis is now about 50%. Cancers with higher survivability rates are: 
testis, 90%; colon, 54%, and breast, 74%. Cancers with lower rates are: 
leukemia, 31%; lung, 13%, and stomach, 16%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COSTS 
</P>
<P>
Taking into account hospital costs, the loss of job productivity and the loss 
of employable years, cancer costs about $72 billion a year in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Cancer accounts for about 10% of the cost of all disease in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On average, the person who dies from cancer dies 15 years earlier than his or 
her normal life expectancy. Lung cancer accounts for a loss of about 1.8 
million years of life every year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of oncogenes has probably been the most important cancer research 
discovery in the past two decades. Oncogenes are abnormal genes that appear to 
be capable of "ordering" a cell to become a cancer cell. Although scientists 
have identified about 20 human oncogenes, they have yet to unravel the 
mysteries of the how the "ordering" occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of substances called anti-oncogenes may prove to be equally 
important. Anti-oncogenes are substances that somehow "turn off" cancer cells 
and transform them back to normal cells. (Proteoglycans, the substance that the 
La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation is working with, is an anti-oncogene.) 
Research on anti-oncogenes is at an early stage and the potential for use in 
treatment is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the recent progress in research can be credited to the discovery of 
monoclonal antibodies, genetically engineered antibodies that can be created in 
great quantities in the laboratory. The human immune system creates many kinds 
of natural antibodies to foreign proteins, such as viruses. Some natural 
antibodies may neutralize the proteins; others may not. In contrast, monoclonal 
antibodies are designed to seek out and attack specific proteins. They have 
become an important tool for isolating and identifying specific cell parts and 
cell mechanisms. They are used to a limited degree as diagnostic tools. 
Scientists are also working to couple monoclonal antibodies with 
cancer-fighting drugs to more effectively target treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made with conventional cancer treatments, particularly in the 
area of chemotherapy. Doctors now know that combinations of certain drugs can 
effectively treat some types of leukemia that previously would not respond well 
to any single drug. New methods of delivering anti-cancer drugs also have been 
developed that have proved more effective. At UC San Diego Cancer Center, an 
experimental treatment for ovarian cancer has shown promise. It involves 
administering high concentrations of cancer drugs through an abdominal catheter 
and applying more directly greater doses of drugs than standard intravenous 
treatment currently allows

ESCALANTE THE BEST TEACHER IN AMERICA BY JAY MATHEWS (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 322 
PP.; 0-8050-0450-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ernest L. Boyer, Boyer, former United States commissioner of education and 
author of High School (Harper &amp; Row), currently is president of The 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name Jaime Escalante has been emblazoned recently in headlines, first 
through the film, "Stand and Deliver," that made him a star of sorts, and then 
during the presidential debates when George Bush dramatically singled out 
Escalante, when asked about his heroes. Now, Jay Mathews, in a timely and 
wonderfully written account, gives us a closer, more revealng look at the man 
behind the legend. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews, an award-winning reporter, has a nose for a good story. In 1982, he 
was attracted to Garfield High through news reports that students in this East 
Los Angeles school were accused of cheating on an Advanced Placement calculus 
exam. What struck Mathews, however, was not the accusations, but that a school 
like Garfield, with a student body drawn from a poor Latino community, could 
find 18 students to enroll in what was equivalent to a tough college-level 
course. His investigations led him to Escalante and five years of intimate 
contact with the Garfield community. 
</P>
<P>
In the first portion of the book, Mathews interweaves sketches of the early 
lives of his three chief protagonists in the Garfield miracle: Escalante, 
principal Henry Gradillas, and a younger member of the math department, 
Benjamin Soto Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
We learn that Escalante grew up in Bolivia, becoming one of the top teachers in 
La Paz at an early age. He and his family immigrated to Southern California 
because of chronic financial worries (the United States is not alone in paying 
its teachers poorly), but before being allowed to teach in California schools, 
he had to get an American college degree. 
</P>
<P>
After working as a cook to support his family while attending night school, 
Escalante, urged on by his wife, Fabiola Tapia, finally, in his mid-'40s, 
returned to teaching. Ironically, his baptism into the depressing waters of 
Garfield left him discouraged -- almost ready to quit after just one year. 
</P>
<P>
Mathews captures the humanity of this saga, breathing life into the students, 
admnistrators, and teachers who make up Garfield High. Escalante himself is 
presented as a man driven by motivations that are both noble and complex. 
</P>
<P>
I assumed from the hyped-up subtitle of the book -- "the Best Teacher in 
America" -- that Escalante would be portrayed in heroic proportions, and in a 
way he is. But Mathews is a good reporter, and paints the central figure of 
this book from every angle, warts and all. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered throughout is an entertaining record of Escalante-isms in the 
classroom, the catch phrases and nicknames, the goads, gimmicks, and insults 
that infuriate, entertain, and ultimately convince his students they can make 
it. 
</P>
<P>
We are also treated to disagreements with colleagues who oppose Escalante's 
aggressive classroom methods. For example, one counselor complains that 
Escalante drives his students too hard in calculus at the expense of other 
areas. Escalante's reply is that "They don't understand that these kids need 
the competition. . . . They're lazy, most of them. You give them more time, 
they go home and watch television, or ride their motorcycles, or go to 
McDonald's. . . . But if they got through calculus, they have something." 
</P>
<P>
There is something to be said for both arguments, of course. But Mathews, ever 
the clear-eyed reporter, refrains from taking sides, leaving the reader to 
weigh the merits of contesting views. 
</P>
<P>
Threaded throughout this compelling narrative is a carefully balanced reporting 
of life in an urban school. Mathews is less interested in relating horror 
stories (although there are episodes that cause even the most optimistic reader 
almost to lose hope), choosing instead to concentrate on the daily lives of 
average students and on the low expectations that trap them in a 
self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the controversy over cheating, the author presents all the facts as 
fully as they can be determined. He makes no effort to gloss over evidence 
suggesting that the similar test results in 1982 on one particular question 
were hardly the result of chance. On the other hand, Mathews underscores the 
point that when the examinations were retaken, the students did exceptionally 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The author reminds the reader that the cloud of doubt surrounding "cheating" 
should not distract from the larger lessons to be learned. Here are students 
who were going nowhere. Because of the energy and will of a few dedicated 
teachers and administrators, things did, in fact, get better. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Mathews is a reporter, not a reformer. But by painstakingly accumulating 
facts and presenting them with power, the reader begins to understand why 
students fail and what changes must be introduced if we hope to save innercity 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Time and time again, we are brought to share Escalante's frustrations with the 
system, the lax administrators, and bored students. We cheer his efforts to 
instill acceptable codes of behavior, rid the school of childishly simple 
textbooks, and make his students want to learn. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Mathews drives home the point that simple formulas for school 
reform simply will not work; that raising standards is not enough; that one man 
cannot do it all alone. Schooling is a human enterprise, one that reaches 
beyond academic requirements and scores on a national exam. If we are to create 
an atmosphere where teaching is respected and learning prized, everyone in the 
school community must be involved -- parents, administrators, students, and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"Escalante" vividly underscores the point that we are facing not merely a 
school problem, but a family and youth problem in this nation. And, if our 
educational system is to succeed, ways must be found to touch students' lives. 
A course in higher mathematics alone may seem an unlikely way to do it, but 
"Escalante" offers undeniable proof of its effectiveness in raising the 
self-esteem of students. 
</P>
<P>
While Americans talk about providing quality education for all children, far 
too many, both in and out of the nation's schools, do not believe this 
objective can be reached. It is unacceptable to perpetuate a system in which 
failure is commonplace and students are passed along in an all-too-familiar 
pattern that divides the winners and the losers. 
</P>
<P>
Our country must reaffirm equality of opportunity and give it meaning in every 
classroom. "Escalante's" reassuring message is that, with high hopes and an 
uncompromising commitment to high standards, students, regardless of their 
backgrounds, can academically and socially succeed.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE AVENUE, CLAYTON CITY BY C. ERIC LINCOLN (BALLANTINE 
BOOKS: $3.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
C. Eric Lincoln, renowned author of works of nonfiction, is probably best known 
as the man who invented the term "Black Muslim" and introduced the Nation of 
Islam to America at large in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's first work of fiction is set in a mythical Southern town just before 
World War II, where the main commercial thoroughfare separates the elite white 
residences Downtown from the unpaved Uptown area where blacks live. 
</P>
<P>
Ben "Guts" Gallimore owns the Blue Flame, the only black restaurant in Clayton 
City; but he secretly longs for "the call from the Lord . . . and a little 
church with a steeple on top." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Walter Pickney Tait, a man who "just sort of materialized" in town with a 
half-white alcoholic wife, an 18-year-old daughter and a shaded past, makes his 
round of sick calls: Good Jelly, at 400 pounds, requires 72 stitches to stop 
the blood after a lunatic slices him with a razor on a Saturday night.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE SUPREME COURT HOW IT WAS, HOW IT IS BY WILLIAM H. 
REHNQUIST (QUILL/WILLIAM MORROW: $10.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Combining personal anecdote and juridical analysis, the chief justice of the 
United States presents details of his own background and discusses the history 
of the Supreme Court in language accessible to the literate layman. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist does not discuss court cases since 1953 in which his current 
colleagues played a part. He writes instead of his own beginnings as law clerk 
to Robert H. Jackson, an associate justice of the Supreme Court, and of his 
first years at the Capital. 
</P>
<P>
He presents a cogent precis of the Court from the time of John Marshall to the 
mid-20th Century and sketches the lives and personalities of some of the 
important justices of our time. 
</P>
<P>
The most instructive section is the last, which provides a summary of the 
mechanics of the Supreme Court. Of the more than 5,000 appeals received per 
year, the justices choose which cases to bring to the full court; of these 
cases, each is debated for a full hour and an opinion conveying the outcome of 
the final vote is written -- the drafting of which may take months.

 HOT FLASHES: Is Chrysalis Records' colorful president Mike Bone on his way out 
as head of that label? That's been the big rumor in the record industry, with 
trade-paper reports saying Bone could be headed toward Arista Records, which 
just lost its top exec, Donnie Ienner (who's moving to CBS). The rumors have 
been fueled by reports of a possible sale to BMG Music or a takeover bid by 
David Geffen, who recently purchased 10% of Chrysalis stock. We'd bet against 
Bone leaving. A longtime promotion whiz whose speciality was breaking hard-rock 
bands, Bone would seem out of place at Arista, a label largely devoted to 
mainstream pop acts. Meanwhile, he can point to a promising crop of young bands 
at Chrysalis, including Was (Not Was), Pursuit of Happiness and the Waterboys 
(who've all topped the 100,000 sales mark). "If it wasn't for all these trade 
press rumors, there'd be a lot more pine trees in south Georgia," Bone 
responded. "I have no desire or plans to leave here. I couldn't be happier 
here. I'm real proud of what we've accomplished so far."

 SOUL ON SOUL: The Soul Train Music Awards, which air here April 12 at 8 p.m. 
on Channel 11, will debut a new honor category -- the Sammy Davis Jr. Award, 
which goes to the year's outstanding live performer. The first recipient is 
(surprise) Michael Jackson! Show organizers say Jackson will be on hand to 
accept the award, which is more than they can say for Davis, who'll make the 
presentation -- via satellite -- from Norway, where he has a concert 
engagement. . . . Jeff Beck's new band is called Surprise Surprise. . . . Jules 
Shear has cut a solo album (sans the Reckless Sleepers). Called "The Third 
Party," it's due out later this spring on I.R.S. Records. . . . Babyface (of 
the Grammy-nominated L.A. and Babyface production team) is at work on a solo 
album for Motown Records. . . . One of our metal faves, Motorhead, has just 
signed with Enigma Records. Expect a new album later this year. . . . Our Title 
of the Week goes to Gang Green, the Boston skateboard-thrash band, whose new 
RoadRacer Records EP is called "I81B4U," (a sly spoof of Van Halen's recent 
"OU812"). . . . And Irish popsters Hothouse Flowers, who'll be at the Roxy for 
three nights beginning Monday, will do an impromptu "busker" show at the Hard 
Rock Cafe today. Starting at 1 p.m., the group will be on hand, donating a 
mandolin to the restaurant's celebrity-instrument collection and giving away 
albums to fans. . . . And our condolences to Ted Nugent, whose mother -- known 
as Ma Nuge -- died recently of cancer. Ma Nuge had been a regular concert-goer 
and written a teen advice column for RIP magazine. She'll be missed.

She has a pet turtle that sleeps in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures of a dead rock 'n' roll singer, Jim Morrison, cover her bedroom walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think it's really weird," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie thinks it's normal. She's been collecting garter belts for years and 
likes to show them off. Lots of people collect things, she says. And lots of 
people have pets they love. 
</P>
<P>
The Morrison obsession, however, has earned Jeannie a measure of distinction. 
She has scavenged rare records, magazine interviews and photographs of Morrison 
and his band, the Doors. At age 33, Jeannie has become queen of the Doors fans, 
king of the hill perched atop a mountain of aging LPs and teen tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people call it an obsession," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And some people are stunned when they see what she's got packed into her 
condominium. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past 20 years, I've seen most of that stuff in different places around 
the world, but to see it all in one woman's apartment in the Valley is 
amazing," says Danny Sugerman, a longtime friend of the Doors who co-wrote the 
best-selling Morrison biography "No One Here Gets Out Alive." 
</P>
<P>
Tenacity, Sugerman says. Jeannie's got tenacity and that's what it took to 
track down all these bits of history of a rock star who died mysteriously 
almost two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
"She's testament to the fact that Jim is dead because if he was alive, she'd 
have found him by now." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Manzarek, the Doors' keyboard player, has his own theory about Jeannie. He 
too has stopped by to see her collection. 
</P>
<P>
"She's very devoted. Ultimately, I think, it stems from a love for the music 
and a love for Jim. He was a Greek god. He was Dionysus and Jeannie is playing 
the role of the maenad, a female follower of Dionysus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Greek myth come to life. Seriously, these are psychological 
archetypes." 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie insists that she has a life away from Jim Morrison. She works as a 
secretary and she writes poetry. Some of her friends aren't even Doors fans. 
</P>
<P>
She can't quite explain her hobby. She says the more you know about Morrison, 
the more you understand that her interest in him is "a beautiful thing." 
Anyway, Jeannie doesn't want to talk about Jeannie. She wants to talk about 
Jim. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows the bad things about Jim, she says. The alcohol and drugs. 
Getting arrested in Las Vegas for fighting a cop. Getting arrested in Phoenix 
for roughhousing on an airplane. Getting arrested in Miami, where the police 
said he exposed himself on stage. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, of course, his death at age 27 in a bathtub in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
People, she says, don't know the good things. How he and Manzarek and Robby 
Krieger and John Densmore were college-educated, having gone to UCLA. How 
Morrison grew disenchanted with rock 'n' roll and spent his final days devoted 
to poetry and film making. 
</P>
<P>
And the songs he left behind: "L.A. Woman," "Crystal Ship," "Strange Days." The 
Doors disbanded in 1973, two years after Morrison died, yet their music still 
plays over the radio and their albums sell 100,000 copies a year. 
</P>
<P>
People, she says, don't give Jim Morrison the credit he deserves because they 
don't know him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows him better than I do. I mean, I know he's dead and all. But I 
know where his head was at, his sadness." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Jeannie ever met Morrison. She didn't even like the Doors back then. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever 'Light My Fire' came on the radio," she says of the Doors' 1967 hit, 
"I hated it." 
</P>
<P>
But three years ago, while Jeannie was vacationing in Palm Springs, she found a 
paperback by the Jacuzzi. It was "The Lords and the New Creatures," a 
collection of Morrison's poetry published before his death. 
</P>
<P>
"I just fell in love with his writing," she recalls. "Then I fell in love with 
his face. I thought, 'This guy is cute. Who is he?' " 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie didn't realize that poet and rock star were the same man. Five months 
later, she saw a Doors video -- "Love Me Two Times" -- on MTV and made the 
connection. She fell in love with Morrison's music. 
</P>
<P>
From that point began a journey. At night and on weekends, Jeannie went 
anywhere she could forage Morrison artifacts. She picked through record bins at 
swap meets and sat on the floors of a hundred bookstores sifting through old 
magazines. She telephoned and wrote to surviving band members, record company 
executives and Doors fan clubs around the world. 
</P>
<P>
These people sent her records and posters and photographs. The collection grew 
to include a Russian copy of "Light My Fire" and a Japanese single of "Hello, I 
Love You" with a drawing on the sleeve that depicts the Doors with 
almond-shaped eyes. Jeannie found Morrison articles in old copies of such 
magazines as Teen Set, Crawdaddy and Trouser Press. 
</P>
<P>
Such items are worth money to Doors collectors, but Jeannie accumulated them at 
little cost. She bought rare 45s for $2 from flea market vendors who didn't 
know their value. She paid 25 cents for out-of-print magazines at bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
And she got technical. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Jeannie obtained 
an FBI file on Morrison's Phoenix arrest. She got hold of a photocopy of the 
fingerprint sheet from his Las Vegas arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In just three years, the collection has outgrown Jeannie's condominium. Most of 
it is packed into a nearby storage locker. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of intense Doors fans around, but nobody with the thoroughness 
and largeness of Jeannie," Sugerman says. "Her devotion to the band is 
impressive." 
</P>
<P>
The story of Jeannie and other devoted fans has a flip side. 
</P>
<P>
It comes from the people who are the objects of their obsession -- Manzarek, 
Krieger and Densmore. Manzarek said Jeannie becomes overenthusiastic at times, 
but most often is polite. Not all fans are so restrained; there are endless 
letters, phone calls and intrusions by adoring followers. 
</P>
<P>
And some of these people weren't even born in the late 1960s and early '70s 
when the Doors were big. The band lasted just five years, Sugerman says, and 
its members have spent 18 years answering for all they accomplished in that 
short time. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of thing doesn't happen to most people in their lives," Manzarek 
says. "The point is, it did happen to me and I have to deal with it. If you're 
going to play a game in public, you'd better be ready to deal with the public, 
and be gentle with them. 
</P>
<P>
"You must understand, most of the fans are good people," he says. "This is 
love. Jeannie loves the Doors. These people love the Doors. 
</P>
<P>
"They're as in love with the Doors as I am and John is and Robby is. Talk about 
obsessed. . . . John and Robby and Danny and I are obsessed. We're obsessed 
with the Doors. We're the biggest fans." 
</P>
<P>
But there is a distinct difference between fans and people who exhibit what 
psychologists call obsessive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"In a general sense . . . if you are a fan of Shakespeare, you read his plays. 
If you are a fan of Jim Morrison, you listen to his music," psychologist Rex 
Beaber says. "The persons who are obsessive go beyond the artist's creations. 
They want to know the artist; they want to possess the artist. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone does that to a degree, like wanting to read about their favorite star 
in People magazine, wanting to know more about that person," Beaber says. "But 
for most people, the fantasy is just a temporary pleasure. For obsessive 
people, it's a permanent solution." 
</P>
<P>
Sugerman, as manager of the band's affairs, receives mail from these people, 
letters that range from harmless to threatening to strange -- a psychiatrist 
once wrote that his patient thought she was demonically possessed by Morrison. 
And eight years ago, Sugerman returned from vacation to find a 20-year-old fan 
in his apartment, wearing his John Lennon T-shirt and rummaging through his 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie isn't that way, he says. Besides, like Manzarek, Sugerman is tolerant. 
As a 13-year-old, he hung around the Doors' business office until he got hired 
to answer the band's fan mail. He has been with them ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"To an extent, I can sympathize with the fans," he says. "I can understand the 
excitement of being close to the Doors." 
</P>
<P>
The difference between then and now, he says, is that the Doors don't exist 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie is glad that Morrison isn't around. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safer that way," she says, but she can't explain what she means by that. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors persist that the rock singer faked his death and has been living in 
seclusion. Jeannie doesn't believe that. Neither does she believe the official 
report that he died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to say it was a broken heart." 
</P>
<P>
You see, Morrison's legend can't disappoint Jeannie. He won't grow old or fat 
or come out with a mediocre album. Best of all, Jeannie can take part in 
keeping his legend alive. A film production company is working on a movie about 
the singer's life, so it comes to her for information. A radio producer puts 
together a six-hour Doors special, so he comes to Jeannie for some of her 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows him better than I do," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning when she gets up, Jeannie sees photographs of Morrison hanging in 
her bathroom. Small notes are pasted beneath the pictures: "Scrub Back," "Wash 
Hair." Some nights, Jeannie watches videos of the Doors in concert. Sometimes 
she mimics Morrison. 
</P>
<P>
"I can walk and talk just like him."

LIVES OF MARTIN MAGNER: FAME IN EUROPE, TV PIONEER AND ACTIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Magner has lived several lives in his almost 89 years. In his current 
incarnation, the Los Angeles-based director is prepping for the Friday opening 
of "La Ronde" at the Harman Avenue Theatre in Hollywood. From 1939 to 1965, he 
lived in New York, directing television at CBS. Before that, he'd built a 
reputation in Europe as one of the leading directors of modern theater. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Germany, Magner discovered acting at 18. "I had no idea what a director 
is," he admitted in his gently fractured English. "I thought it is someone who 
makes sure the actors don't bump into each other. As an actor, I played a lot 
of ghosts, did many plays by Strindberg, Dr. Rank in 'A Doll's House,' 
Mephisto. I think I was quite a good devil -- a little devil." 
</P>
<P>
By 1930, he was working in an increasingly politicized theatrical community. "I 
hate to say leftist because it was just tremendously progressive, very aware -- 
aware of the times, and completely opposed to the Nazi ideology," Magner noted. 
The general director of the theater, who felt especially vulnerable because 
both of his parents were Jewish, feared the repercussions of his work and 
hurriedly left town. 
</P>
<P>
Officials lost no time filling the post with the half-Jewish Magner. "There 
must be some mistake," he told them. "You can't make me general director; I am 
on both sides Jewish." The visitors produced the 1904 death certificate of his 
father, Maximilian Magner -- a Lutheran. "There was nothing I could say," he 
recalled grimly. "They said, 'You don't know that?' I said, 'Well, my memory is 
sometimes foggy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Magner held the uneasy position until the night of March 21, 1933, (he 
remembers the exact date of all the important events in his life), when he 
received orders to fire the seven Jewish actors in the company. Without waiting 
for the banks to open in the morning, he packed a suit and a tuxedo, gathered 
his hat, coat and briefcase, and took the night train to Vienna. Three years 
later, Magner sailed to America. 
</P>
<P>
He holds tight to many cherished memories of his life in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Such as the time George Bernard Shaw paid an impromptu visit to a rehearsal of 
Magner's radical production of Shaw's "Too True to Be Good" and declared, 
"Sometimes youth is not wasted on the young" before he strode away. Or the time 
Sigmund Freud (amused by a show Magner was staging, in which a Freud look-alike 
psychiatrist fell asleep over his patient), invited the young director over for 
tea -- and, several meetings later, suggested that Magner become a lay analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Though he speaks proudly of his accomplishments -- he was presented a special 
award from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle in 1975 -- there is, even in 
the grandest of statements, an endearing absence of hauteur. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pioneered so much in my life," he said of the early years in TV. " 
'Studio One,' 'Montgomery Presents.' It was a medium that was not yet 
developed. We had to do that. And we could experiment to our heart's content. 
Nobody was looking over our shoulder saying, 'Don't do that' -- because nobody 
knows anything. It was the most exciting direction because it was in your 
hands. In theater, you're backstage biting your nails. But in live television, 
you are in control: You edit while you're on the air." 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory retirement forced Magner out of CBS in 1965, and he resettled in 
California with his third wife, Marion Palfi, whom he lost to breast cancer in 
1979. "We 
</P>
<P>
were two bachelors living together," he said of their 27-year marriage. "She 
supported what I did; I supported what she did. She was a remarkable woman, a 
great photographer. Four Guggenheims." He gestures to a volume of 
black-and-white photos, "Invisible in America," Palfi's bold and eloquent 
chronicle of poverty in the South in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"When she was marching in Selma with Martin Luther King, she turned to him and 
said, 'Aren't you afraid?' He said, 'Aren't you?' " 
</P>
<P>
Palfi, a former beauty queen and Ziegfeld star (Magner remembers her face 
adorning public kiosks when he was a young man) effected social change through 
her photos: Robert Kennedy used them in the Justice Department's case against 
the anti-segregationists; they were also instrumental in changing many of the 
country's child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Palfi taught photography at the Inner City Cultural Center, while 
Magner directed several plays there. "He had an eye for detail," said C. 
Bernard Jackson, ICCC executive director. "Most directors just go for the 
gusto. But I learned from Martin to look for the literary quality, to see 
things beyond their most superficial aspects. Also, at a time when other 
directors weren't utilizing multiracial casts, he did a lot of non-traditional 
casting." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, "La Ronde," Schnitzler's 19th-Century merry-go-round of love 
and sex, had been one of the plays Magner staged at ICCC; he felt that the time 
was right to visit the work again. "Not that the play is a challenge," he 
admitted. "But it is a charming show, and I like Schnitzler very much. There is 
insight into people of both genders. It's a knowing show, it's smiling -- and, 
I think, it's a very funny play. Risque, yes." (When he originally staged it in 
Europe, "the audience throws stink bombs on stage.") 
</P>
<P>
After a career steeped in heavy works -- "Genet, Sartre, untold Shaws, Athol 
Fugard at a time when nobody knows of him" -- Magner, whose theater work is 
supported by the local Goethe Institute, is relishing comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, light things is much more difficult than heavy," the director said. 
"Even back in Germany, when I started, I never liked Teutonic acting. Every 
line was filled with unbelievable importance, as unnatural as you could be. I 
never acted this way. And when I directed, I always said to the actors, 'Why 
don't you talk to each other -- talk and listen.' But in Germany, they like 
major against minor, crashing all the time." 
</P>
<P>
A former mountain climber ("The desire is not to get to the top -- anybody can 
do that -- but to get higher and higher, into the lighter and lighter air"), 
Magner appears to be a man at peace with his life. "I came in with the century; 
I don't expect to go out with it," he said calmly. 
</P>
<P>
"I had an operation a year ago, a blood clot next to my brain. Afterward, I 
crawled out of the bed, took one of the walkers and walked till the nurses 
caught me and brought me back. I wanted to live, and I wanted to be well. 
</P>
<P>
"And I am."

SCIENCE WRITERS' CONTEST;

<P>
WHY FROGS GO A-COURTIN' AND OTHER ODD MYSTERIES

<P>
Why do poison toads attend a frog orgy? Are you aware there is irrefutable 
evidence of intelligent life on Mars? And if the moon takes a month to revolve 
around Earth, why is it seen over Detroit every night? 
</P>
<P>
Those strange questions -- and a bizarre variety of theories -- were contained 
in several dozen letters received by the nation's science writers and entered 
in a contest called "Ideas Galileo Never Thought Of." 
</P>
<P>
The Northern California Science Writers Assn. sponsored the contest during the 
recent annual meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Science writer James Cornell, publications manager at the Harvard-Smithsonian 
Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., swept first, second and third 
places with letters that landed on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The winning entry came from a Cambridge woman befuddled by news of mass mating 
rituals among frogs in Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
"What I have been wondering is whether all those different kinds of frogs 
managed to find their own kind of frog to mate with, what with the crowds and 
confusion and all; or whether they got all mixed up, which would mean that by 
now we are faced with the specter of ever new varieties of weirdo frogs," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, what were the poisonous toads doing there? They're not frogs, after all, 
and why should they even bother showing up at a frog orgy, just because they 
happen to be amphibious and hop? Please have your frogologist respond as soon 
as possible because I'm starting to get really hung up on these issues." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit Free Press science writer Nancy Ross-Flanigan got an ungrammatical 
letter from a man who didn't know the Earth rotates as the moon orbits it. 
</P>
<P>
"The moon is supposed to travel around the Earth in a month time. Then what is 
this moon that revolve around the city of Detroit every day to every other day? 
And what is it doing?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
In another letter to Cornell, a Cincinnati man asserted that his 12-year study 
of Mars photographs "resulted in irrefutable evidence of a civilized society of 
intelligent beings on the Red Planet." 
</P>
<P>
Cornell said the writers of such letters "are harmless. They just have a skewed 
view of what the world is. I wouldn't want anyone to make fun of them. . . . 
They are simply attempting to establish their own version of scientific 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I must admit some of them do break me up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small Bang Theory 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Petit, a San Francisco Chronicle science writer and president of the 
National Assn. of Science Writers, got a letter from a man who theorized that 
continents formed and life on Earth started when a moon named "Yasoon" hit the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Such correspondents mean to be serious, and although their ideas "may be silly 
and funny, I would never regard the people who think of them as ridiculous," 
Petit said. "I tip my hat to them for daring to say things that elicit giggles. 
I would not want to be a member of a society where nobody came up with crazy 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Some offer more than ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to . . . have one of my hands amputated and scientifically 
demonstrate how Regenerative Medicine Works. As a result, a new hand will grow 
back," said a Brazilian man's letter to a scientist at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The researcher forwarded the letter to free-lancer Lynne Timpani Friedmann, 
then a university spokeswoman, with a note saying, "Please add this to the 
wacko file." 
</P>
<P>
The contest's second-place letter, written by a Texas man, began: "Dear Sir: It 
is generally believed by scientists that the Earth is a giant magnet, but this 
is not quite true. . . . The Earth is, in reality, a GIANT photoelectric cell." 
</P>
<P>
In third place, from South Carolina, was this complete letter: "Dear 
Presidents, Directors and Other Communications Coordinators, Global abstinence 
from March 15 through April 15, combined with curative measures, as needed, can 
virtually eradicate gonorrhea, and much more. How many months have 11 days?" 
</P>
<P>
Among other contest entries: 
</P>
<P>
* A letter to Petit, outlining a new theory on "The Nature and Treatment of 
Stupidity -- Diagnosis and Prognosis." It began: "Human beings (deceitful, 
neurotic, talking predators) are uniquely stupid organisms because they are 
talking organisms." 
</P>
<P>
* A Connecticut man's letter to Scientific American magazine contending that 
the universe didn't start with the "big bang" but with a "big knock." 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego Tribune science writer Ann Gibbons got a letter from a man who 
claimed he could eliminate local wildfires, floods, sewage problems and traffic 
jams at no cost to the taxpayers. "Before heading this letter to the nearest 
trash can, please read carefully all of it," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
* A Miami Beach man's letter to Cornell claiming credit for being the genius 
who "suggested that spare tires be narrow so they would occupy less trunk 
space," "suggested that all cloth used for clothing be preshrunk," "suggested a 
method for curing mental disease with electronics," and "presented some 
evidence that black holes do not exist." 
</P>
<P>
* One man's letter detailing a "formula for the nature and natural order of the 
universe." His simple theory: "What must be, must be, and what cannot be, 
cannot be. Such is Mother Nature's way of informing mankind of right and 
wrong."

The whole family helped out when Dican Hadjy Kabakjian began moonlighting in 
his basement in 1924, stretching his physics professor's salary and riding the 
crest of a promising new cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Kabakjian was a great man and a brilliant scientist, said one neighbor in the 
middle-class suburb of towering trees, stately old houses, quiet dead-end 
streets and back yards big enough for great games of hide-and-go-seek. 
</P>
<P>
The business in the basement of the three-story, stucco-and-frame Victorian 
duplex helped get the Kabakjians through the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
It also did something else: It made theirs the only single residence on the 
government's list of the most toxic waste sites in America. 
</P>
<P>
For two decades, until Kabakjian died in 1945, the family supplied doctors and 
hospitals with radium-tipped needles to insert near cancerous tumors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd take the raw stuff and cook it until you get these radium crystals," said 
Kabakjian's daughter, Alice Kabakjian Lewis, 74. Her sister Louise would weigh 
the crushed crystals and pack them into platinum needles. The physicist's sons 
Armen and Raymond worked during vacations. Dicranouhi Kabakjian helped her 
husband when she wasn't keeping his house. Daughter Lillian kept the books. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Fear of Radiation 
</P>
<P>
There was no fear of radiation then; far from it. Two decades after it was 
discovered, radium was hailed as a miracle treatment for everything from cancer 
to tonsillitis. It would be years before scientists learned that radium decays 
into radon gas that can cause cancer. The disease may not show up for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Someone living in the house 16 hours a day for their whole life stood a 1-in-3 
chance of cancer, said Victor Janosik, who is managing the cleanup for the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Kabakjian died at 65 of abdominal cancer, in 1977. His son, Raymond 
Jr., died of bladder cancer in 1983, at age 37. William Dooner, who delivered 
radium, died in 1984 at age 71 of cancer of the head and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Dican Kabakjian didn't develop cancer. He died in 1945, at 70, of emphysema 
probably caused by fumes from the acid he used to process the radium ore. 
</P>
<P>
The Tallant family bought the house in 1949 and lived there until moving into a 
bigger place in 1961. Anna Tallant died of breast cancer in 1969, at 54. 
</P>
<P>
The "hot house" came to light in 1962 during a search for forgotten radium 
sites. In 1964, authorities spent $200,000 to decontaminate it. They declared 
success after removing furniture, dishes, rugs and clothing, and after 
replacing windows, walls, sinks and a concrete basement floor. That September 
the couple who owned it, Harry and Mary Kizirian, moved back in. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1983, during a survey of sites that might be eligible for federal 
cleanup assistance, the EPA found radon levels in the basement 10 times higher 
than allowable and gamma radiation, similar to X-rays, 3 1/2 times higher. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On Superfund List 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the house was put on the EPA's Superfund list. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, white-suited workers equipped with oxygen masks, vacuums and 
Geiger counters arrived. They dismantled the house board by board and brick by 
brick. All but 1 1/2 bricks had been contaminated with radium. 
</P>
<P>
The trees where neighborhood children played were uprooted; squirrels had 
scampered up them carrying radioactivity from the ground where Kabakjian dumped 
workshop waste. The yard was dug up, too, leaving a 9-foot-deep pit. 
</P>
<P>
About 240 feet of sewer line running down the street is contaminated and will 
have to be replaced. None of the surrounding houses have been found to be 
contaminated, but six lots showed higher-than-normal radioactivity, pushing the 
cleanup cost from $7.5 million to $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel a great deal of anxiety about radiation," said Georgianna 
Gretzenberg. The back door of the house she and her husband bought in 1987 is 
20 to 30 yards from the chain-link fence that surrounds the empty lot and from 
the trailers where workers are checked for contamination. The free-standing 
garage they planned to turn into a studio may be lost to the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad to see the neighborhood ripped up. For me, it's more that," said 
Gretzenberg, who had a healthy baby boy six months ago. "My biggest concern is 
they won't finish. I hope it will be done so we can go back to doing what you 
do in suburbia." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Click, who has lived behind the house for 23 years, said, "We were told 
as long as it's not in our house, we shouldn't be concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kizirian, whose family bought the house from the Tallants, wonders if 
the radium can be blamed for illnesses that afflicted his family, including 
sores that developed on his father's legs before he died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$64 Question 
</P>
<P>
"That's the $64 question. Our understanding is the long-term effects of 
radiation have not been proven," Kizirian said. He has considered suing, but 
isn't sure whom to sue, and lawyers say he is lucky the EPA paid for the 
cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The costs included $140,000 paid to the Kizirians and the Basehore family, who 
lived in the other side of the duplex. The families retain ownership of the 
land, which will be filled and landscaped when the work is done this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Kizirian said that given its history, he doubts that anyone will buy, so he and 
the other heirs to his parents' estate might donate it to the town. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Basehore, who is in her 70s, declined to talk at length about her 
experiences, but considers Kabakjian to be a great man. She hasn't decided what 
to do when the property can be occupied again, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the EPA finishes they'll certify they don't have a radiation problem," 
said George Bochanski, a borough councilman and former Environmental Protection 
Agency spokesman. "That's more than some of us can say."

The Soviet Union conducted a low-yield underground nuclear test Friday of up to 
20 kilotons at its main military testing area at Semipalatinsk, in Soviet 
Cental Asia, the official Tass press agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The test, which took place at 7:01 a.m. Moscow time, was the third this year 
and the second in six days. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty kilotons is the equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT. The U.S. bomb dropped 
on Hiroshima in World War II had a yield of 13 kilotons.

9-YEAR PROJECT FOR TIMEPIECE WITH 1,728 PARTS, 33 FUNCTIONS;

SWISS FIRM TOOK LONG TIME TO BUILD WORLD'S MOST COMPLICATED WATCH

It takes five years for one of the 184 tiny wheels in a new Swiss watch to 
complete a single revolution. Another wheel takes a century. Then after 400 
years, a lever has to be moved so the watch's calendar won't skip a leap year 
date. 
</P>
<P>
It also is the first timepiece to calculate the date of Easter and features a 
celestial chart showing the Milky Way and 2,800 Northern Hemisphere stars. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-karat gold Calibre 89, which has a diameter of 3.4 inches and weighs 2.4 
pounds, has two dials and 24 hands. Packed among its parts are 68 springs, 126 
jewels and 332 screws. 
</P>
<P>
Patek Philippe, the Geneva company that recently unveiled the Calibre 89 to 
mark its 150th anniversary, says it hasn't any idea how much it can sell the 
watch for, so it plans to auction it off April 9 in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
"We estimate that it will get between 5 million and 10 million Swiss francs 
($3.2 million and $6.4 million)," said Osvaldo Patrizzi, the watch expert at 
Habsburg, Feldman auctioneers of Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.2 Million Sale 
</P>
<P>
To date, the highest price paid for a timepiece at an auction was $1.2 million 
in 1984 for a clock from the mid-17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Patek officials say the company did not keep any accounting of how much Calibre 
89 cost to make since it was not done for marketing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
But Patek is not likely to be contested in its claim that the Calibre 89 is the 
world's most complicated watch. 
</P>
<P>
A team of watchmakers took more than five years to design its 1,728 parts and 
four years more to assemble them. 
</P>
<P>
"At some points, we were greatly worried that we would not succeed," said 
Jean-Pierre Musy, the head of the firm's Complicated Pieces Department. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1927 Packard Watch 
</P>
<P>
Calibre 89 has 33 functions. That is 19 more than the firm's Packard watch of 
1927, which it bought back last year for $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Calibre 89's features include a daily display of the sunrise and sunset, chimes 
that ring on the hour and half-hour, and "power reserve" indicators that show 
when rewinding is needed. The mainspring can run for 30 hours. 
</P>
<P>
But the makers' pride is the watch's "perpetual secular calendar." 
</P>
<P>
It takes into account that a leap year is skipped at the turn of most centuries 
by the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582. Only the century years that are 
exactly divisible by 400, such as 2000 and 2400, have a Feb. 29. 
</P>
<P>
To keep it "up to date," the complicated mechanism makes one wheel turn once 
every five years, triggering a 20-tooth "century wheel" to move on by one 
notch. A peg gives that wheel an extra push every 100 years, thus disengaging 
the calendar mechanism on three out of four century years to skip the leap 
year. A lever re-engages the mechanism after 400 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Cog 
</P>
<P>
The date of Easter, which changes every year, is shown on the watch at midnight 
of the preceding Dec. 31. Calculating the date for more than 30 years would 
require additional mechanisms that would not fit into the watch. So a special 
cog allowing the watch to display it must be replaced every 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Computers helped produce 1,600 blueprints for the watch. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have managed without them," said designer Francois Devaut, who 
conceded that he first thought the plan for Calibre 89 was a "utopian idea." 
</P>
<P>
"But it would have taken us an additional four or five years." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Buclin of the assembly team said synchronizing the various mechanisms was 
the biggest challenge. It would take about two months to take the watch apart 
and reassemble it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can't Match Quartz Watch 
</P>
<P>
Its accuracy, within one minute a month, does not match a cheap quartz watch. 
</P>
<P>
"But precision is not the most important thing," said Philippe Stern, the 
company's managing director. "The tradition of watchmaking is." 
</P>
<P>
Based in Geneva, where the craft dates to the late 16th Century, Patek Philippe 
is the oldest family-owned watchmaker in the world. The Stern family bought the 
company in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said the company hopes to make three more Calibre 89s over the next four 
years, including one for the its private collection of historic watches. 
</P>
<P>
The first one will be auctioned April 9, along with 300 other precious Patek 
Philippe watches, after an exhibition tour of Paris, Milan, New York, Los 
Angeles, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.

</P>
<P>
HOSPITAL PROGRAM AIMS TO BRING PEACE TO WAR-TORMENTED VETERANS 
</P>

<P>
The setting is peaceful, on a lake surrounded by Douglas firs. But peace is far 
from the minds of the war veterans who meet here to unload decades of violent 
and fearful thoughts and feelings. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it's the first time since the war that they've felt free to cry. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people haven't felt in years," said Anne Gregory, manager of 
nurses for the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) program at the Veterans' 
Hospital at American Lake, herself a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that some of these people are still sane is remarkable. PTSD is 
treatable, but it takes time," Gregory said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 470,000 of the 3.14 million vets who served in Vietnam suffer from 
PTSD, and 80% of those never have sought mental help, said American Lake 
director Ray Scurfield. His is one of 14 relatively new programs in this 
country trying to help PTSD victims. Three percent of its participants served 
in Korea and World War II, the rest in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sleepless Nights, Flashbacks 
</P>
<P>
In the company of other vets and a professional staff of 23 that includes 13 
veterans, men who never quite left the war behind tell of sleepless nights, 
flashbacks, guilt over having killed, guilt over having survived, uncontrolled 
anxiety and rage and the isolation they feel. 
</P>
<P>
Holding hands, they ride in Huey helicopters in maneuvers similar to those 
commonly used in the war. The sound of the rotors and rush of wind was enough 
for one to tearfully recall his last flight in a Huey, a trip that ended in an 
ambush and the deaths of 18 of the 35 men in his squad. 
</P>
<P>
Some go on an Outward Bound trip and push their limits in rapids in search of 
new perspectives on their abilities and their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Many vets are hearing for the first time that it is human to feel what they 
feel, and that anyone who has experienced severe trauma -- the Holocaust, for 
example, or even major earthquakes -- can feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
And it is the first time many have let go -- the birth of a long period of 
healing, forgiveness, learning to live with memories, trusting themselves and 
others and hoping for the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Afraid of Them Dying' 
</P>
<P>
"They're digging things out of me here that I didn't even know were issues," 
said Dan Collins, 42, of Tacoma. "You look at somebody and see them blown to 
hell, and they're not there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a convenient way not to make friends, because I'm afraid of them dying . 
. . . I avoid people . . . for that and other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the nice thing about this place. They confront you on it and you have 
to face what's going on inside of you." 
</P>
<P>
Scurfield said any victim of severe trauma can develop chronic symptoms that 
can include intrusive imagery, numbing, helplessness, fear that leads to rage, 
fear that leads to grief, anger against authority and "the system," inability 
to control emotions and actions, broken relationships and work histories, 
depression, anxiety, hypervigilance and sleeping disorders. 
</P>
<P>
They sometimes express those symptoms and other times avoid expression 
altogether, as they probably did at the time the trauma took place. This leads 
to physical and emotional isolation and confusion over personal responsibility, 
self-worth, relationships, work -- even play. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight-Month Waiting List 
</P>
<P>
The 11-week program at American Lake, begun in 1985, has served 350 so far and 
has an eight-month waiting list. Applicants must have served in a war zone, 
have received some counseling already and be drug- and alcohol-free. It costs 
the Veterans Administration $107 per patient per day. 
</P>
<P>
Participants learn about controlling anger, anxiety and stress and about 
substance abuse and PTSD. They also examine prewar experiences that may have 
contributed to their war reaction, war-zone trauma, and their postwar years. 
</P>
<P>
They even look at the benefits of trauma: intense comradeship, emotional and 
spiritual insights and heightened sensitization to life's horrors and to 
political behavior, Scurfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"By going back to the wound, you finally realize that you have to feel the 
pain, the grief, the loss, before the wound is actually healed," said Leonard 
Horst, 42, of Sequim. "You'll always have the scar, but at least you have 
acceptance and forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outpatient Counseling Urged 
</P>
<P>
All are encouraged to attend outpatient counseling for six months to three 
years to consolidate gains made in the program, Scurfield says. Failure to do 
that can easily mean backsliding and renewed isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans listen carefully when Scurfield explains how their anger probably 
stems from fear. How they had to go to Vietnam at a time when they would have 
been undergoing a lot of change anyway and so were especially vulnerable. How 
they are the only ones who can change the crazy life patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"The rage is justified, but you still need to let go of it," Scurfield said. 
"If how you're going to feel or what you're going to do is determined by 
someone else, you're not in control . . . . I'm not saying don't fight, you 
must . . . not let the symptoms control you. Open a valve and release some of 
it without hurting yourself." 
</P>
<P>
The understanding and definition of the disorder continues to evolve. How 
successful American Lake and PTSD treatment are is anybody's guess without a 
better follow-up system and more coordination among the 14 programs, said 
Scurfield, a doctor of social work who did psychiatric work in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increased Aid Urged 
</P>
<P>
A lot more money and programs are needed, especially in the West, Scurfield 
testified before Congress last summer. Special emphasis should be placed on 
professional support for veteran self-help groups in geographically isolated 
areas, where many choose to live because of low, fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Scurfield lays the delayed response in identifying and treating PTSD -- a 
disorder professionals now believe has always existed among trauma victims -- 
to naive psychology trends, right-wing beliefs that common knowledge of PTSD 
would undermine the country's ability to defend itself and concerns over the 
immense potential financial strain of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey sent to 180 American Lake graduates and answered by 85, a 
majority had been helped in self-esteem, relationships and in understanding 
that they have the responsibility and ability to change. But a significant 
minority reported no real change in depression, anxiety, relationships and 
intrusive symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Program Should Be Longer' 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely needed another tuneup and more time," said Richard Fairfield, 39, 
of rural northeast Utah. "It took me 20 years to get as screwed up as I was . . 
. . If they had helped me 20 years ago, I wouldn't be here. The program should 
be longer." 
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of participants have returned once, Scurfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its admitted weaknesses, Steve Petty, a VA social worker in Loma Linda, 
Calif., and a member of a congressionally mandated PTSD committee, says 
American Lake is considered on the cutting edge of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"These people know what's going on," Fairfield said. "When I wake up at 3 a.m. 
drenched in sweat and have to talk, they're there." 
</P>
<P>
It is the only program with a special support group for children of Vietnam 
veterans, and it is the only one that incorporates the helicopter rides.

THE LAND IS LOST, BUT NOT THE TAX BILL

<P>
Shortly before Victor Nascimento bought 11-plus acres of land in 1970, he 
toured the wooded site, which a real estate agent said ran along the town's 
Blue Dot Trail, past Babbling Brook, and stopped at the old oak tree just over 
the Connecticut border. 
</P>
<P>
But the tree has rotted and the brook has dried, Nascimento says, and he's 
baffled because he has been paying taxes on land he can't find. 
</P>
<P>
"You walk in the woods," he says, "and all the trees look the same." 
</P>
<P>
Nascimento and his brother, who is now dead, bought the parcel for $2,100 and 
got a quit-claim deed, which gives them the right to claim the land but not to 
take any recourse against the seller should there be a problem with the title. 
</P>
<P>
Nascimento and his wife, Lynn, of East Providence, and his sister-in-law, Lois, 
were so confused that they refused to pay taxes on the land for two years. 
</P>
<P>
When the town threatened to sell the land to collect the back taxes in 
December, the Nascimentos paid the $455 tax bill. Nascimento said he would get 
a title search, although financial constraints won't allow that soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Dream 
</P>
<P>
"I am an old Boy Scout, and it was my dream to own a piece of land," Nascimento 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Violet, former state attorney general, says if they had gotten a title 
search and title insurance when they bought the land, they would be able to sue 
the title company if they could not find their property. 
</P>
<P>
Violet says there are two recourses: Since the old oak tree, Blue Dot Trail and 
Babbling Brook are identified in the Nascimentos' quit-claim deed, they could 
look for other references to those landmarks, perhaps in older deeds, to try to 
claim ownership. Also, they could obtain topography maps, which are close-ups 
of the land, to find their parcel. 
</P>
<P>
The tax collector agrees with the Nascimentos that the land exists. "There's a 
deed for it, so we're assuming that it exists," says Linda Czerkiewicz of 
Hopkinton. "They bought something." 
</P>
<P>
Nascimento says the original documents filed with his lawyer were destroyed 
when the lawyer's garage burned years ago, and his real estate agent says he 
doesn't remember the Nascimentos. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a chain of taxes people paid on this land, dating back to the 1800s," 
Nascimento says. 
</P>
<P>
He says he bought the land from a Dean Edwards, who inherited the parcel from 
his father, Oliver Edwards. He says Dean Edwards died about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Oliver Edwards was an old-time Yankee," Nascimento says. "These Yankees don't 
pay taxes on land that doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
Not only does he not know where his property is, he doesn't know how much it is 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's quite expensive," he says, "let's put it that way."

After doctors told Bill Smith there was a liver in Chicago small enough for his 
3-month-old son, an air ambulance agent told him the fare from Miami was about 
$7,000 -- in cash, up front. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a 28-year-old carpet cleaning store manager, didn't have the money, and 
his insurance company refused to pay for the trip. The desperate father 
promised to make payments every 15 days even though he had no idea how he would 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
Then the liver in Chicago turned out to be diseased. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flown Courtesy of Fund 
</P>
<P>
But a few weeks later, Zachary Thomas Smith underwent a successful liver 
transplant operation in Pittsburgh, where he and his mother had flown, courtesy 
of the Governor's Transplant Lifeline for Children fund. 
</P>
<P>
The TLC fund, set up almost a year ago, is a state-administered fund of private 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
The largest single donation has come from the San Francisco 49ers football team 
-- $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before its first anniversary, the fund's balance had passed $204,000, 
said Jayne Parker, transplant program coordinator with the state Department of 
Health and Rehabilitative Services. 
</P>
<P>
Last year by mid-November, six Florida children besides Zachary had undergone 
liver transplants, 15 had bone marrow transplants and one had received a heart 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only Family to Need Help 
</P>
<P>
But only one family other than the Smiths needed help from the TLC fund, 
although Parker is negotiating two other cases with families and insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the fund has spent some $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services has negotiated a $130,000 
rate for liver and heart transplants in Florida and is still working on a rate 
for bone marrow transplants, which generally are less expensive. But if a 
Florida transplant center says a child should go out of state, the fund would 
pay for that operation, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
No human has ever survived longer than 4 1/2 months after an intestine 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
The only transplant approved for the TLC fund besides liver, heart and bone 
marrow is kidney, which is completely covered by Medicare, Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising for TLC began last February with a $500-a-ticket reception at the 
governor's mansion that raised more than $70,000, according to B.J. West, a 
volunteer services coordinator with HRS in Orlando.

WHITE S. AFRICAN BECOMES WITCH DOCTOR

PRETORIA, South Africa

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dressed neatly in white smock and trousers, Jan Groenewald receives his 
patients in a scruffy waiting room adorned with skins and tribal trophies. 
</P>
<P>
The slight, blond man politely leads his clients to a tiny examination room 
where he pronounces on their health and future prospects in exchange for a $12 
consultancy fee. 
</P>
<P>
Any idea, however, that Groenewald is in the dental or medical profession 
rapidly disappears when he dons a Zulu headdress and produces a bag of animal 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
Groenewald, 23, better known in the trade as Sangoma Masaka, is one of a 
handful of whites who have qualified as a sangoma, or African witch doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother thinks I am crazy, that the devils have got me, and some of my 
friends think it is very odd for a white man. But I have the talent, the gift," 
he told a reporter during a visit to his office in a busy Pretoria suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Masaka plies his ancient trade with a 20th-Century professional veneer. 
Telephones ring constantly as a witch doctor-trainee takes appointments from 
worried businessmen, impotent lovers and curious housewives. 
</P>
<P>
"I set up practice a few months ago and since then business has been booming. 
About 35% of my clientele is white," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Masaka, the son of an Afrikaner farming family, grew up amid the strict 
Calvinist traditions of his people, descendents of early Dutch settlers. 
</P>
<P>
He became fascinated from an early age by the ancient customs of the black farm 
workers with whom he came in contact and soon came to believe he had the gift 
of a sixth sense. 
</P>
<P>
"I would see an aura around some people. In church I would see people with 
blood on their head. They were soon to die." 
</P>
<P>
Masaka trained as a sangoma after a black man he met offered to take him to 
Zululand for instruction in the ancient art. 
</P>
<P>
After learning the Zulu language, the young Afrikaner was taught the secrets of 
the witch doctor, which have been handed from generation to generation for 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"I look into people's eyes. There I see what sort of character they have, if 
they have a medical problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Telling the past and present, I use my eyes, but if I am asked to predict 
someone's future, I use the bones," he said, pointing to a skin bag holding the 
tools of his trade. 
</P>
<P>
Masaka's bag contains an exotic mixture of shells, playing dice, dominoes, a 
small bank-note, a fox's leg bone, a piece of tortoise shell, and much more. 
</P>
<P>
A throw of the bones gives Masaka information on his patient's future and 
provides the answer to the customary questions -- the number of children the 
patient will have or their likely success in a business venture. 
</P>
<P>
Masaka also uses muti -- a secret mixture of herbs and roots -- to cure 
anything from impotence to arthritis, from a nagging spouse to a financial 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
Strings of roots, piles of leaves and mysterious powders lie heaped on the 
shelves of his "pharmacy," which takes up a corner of his office. 
</P>
<P>
"Already I have had dozens of successes. I have driven out spirits, cured 
epilepsy and solved many sex problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Masaka's herbal cures include a business luck powder, guaranteed to rid the 
troubled executive of all financial problems, a love potion which brings 
bickering couples back into each other's arms, and powders to drive out evil 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"The recipes for my muti are secret," Masaka said. "The important thing is that 
they work." 
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria medicine man now hopes to try his hand abroad. He thinks that the 
United States is ready for his type of business. 
</P>
<P>
"I have already heard from Americans who would like to have a consultation. 
Maybe my future lies there," he added.

DUTCH TRY TO CLEAN UP 'TRASH CAN' OF EUROPE

<P>
Labor, industry and the government are joining in a crusade to save the 
fast-deteriorating environment of the Netherlands, described by a union chief 
as the "trash can of the continent." 
</P>
<P>
Not only does pollution come from the Netherlands' own post-World War II 
industrialization, it also flows down the Rhine River from chemical plants in 
Switzerland and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The pollution issue has been played down by officials in recent years, although 
others have issued repeated warnings about the air, water and soil, but now 
unprecedented steps for the Netherlands apparently are about to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
The 900,000-member Federation of Dutch Trade Unions has linked up in the 
save-the-environment effort with its traditional sparring partner, the Dutch 
Organization of Enterprises, industry's major umbrella group. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers joined in on the government's side. He told a group 
of foreign reporters: "One of our major future aims will be to establish an 
economic structure that safeguards the ecological balance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Queen Voices Concern 
</P>
<P>
Queen Beatrix devoted her entire traditional Christmas address to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Slowly, the Earth is dying, and we think about what was previously unthinkable 
-- the end of life itself," she told her subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The new crusade reflects an unease in the Netherlands over the declining 
quality of the environment, which only a few decades ago was virtually 
unpolluted. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Dutch media have reported on the pollution of drinking 
water by pesticides and herbicides spilled into the Rhine River by Swiss, West 
German and Dutch chemical plants. 
</P>
<P>
Acid rain, attributed mainly to nitrates rising into the atmosphere from manure 
used in Netherlands' huge agricultural sector and the country's 5 million cars, 
is rapidly becoming a prime environmental threat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Polluted Housing Sites 
</P>
<P>
One chemical dump after another is being discovered under housing developments 
built in the 1960s and under new golf courses. A recent government report 
estimated that about 9,000 heavily polluted sites are scattered all over the 
Netherlands, leaching noxious substances into the ground water. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is a prime manufacturer of chemicals, petroleum products and 
electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Care for the environment is such an essential task . . . that I do not 
hesitate to say that for us, (it) is the top priority," said Jan Kamminga, the 
chairman of the Dutch Assn. of Small and Medium-Sized Industries. 
</P>
<P>
"Dutch companies should accept their responsibility . . . and contribute 
substantially to the solution of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
With 100,000 affiliated companies employing 1 million of the Netherlands' 14.6 
million people, the association is one of the major players in the Dutch 
industrial field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joint Effort Announced 
</P>
<P>
After Kamminga made his remarks in a speech, Johan van Stekelenburg of a trade 
union group and Chris van Leede of the industry group held a news conference to 
announced their joint effort to save the environment. 
</P>
<P>
They said they would include environmental issues in the collective bargaining 
process. 
</P>
<P>
"Our declaration will not instantly change the world, but it commits us to take 
such (environmental) issues into serious consideration," Van Leede said in an 
interview later. "It is not an empty promise." 
</P>
<P>
"We must clean up the Netherlands, which is rapidly becoming the trash can of 
the continent," Van Stekelenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given these huge problems, the industry and union initiative can only be a 
beginning," said Marijke Brunt, a spokeswoman for the Nature and Environment 
Foundation, one of this nation's most influential conservationist 
organizations. "If they fail to implement a radical restructuring of Dutch 
industry within 10 years, it will be too late." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Investments 
</P>
<P>
Such a turnaround of the Dutch industrial complex would involve huge 
investments in purification plants, research into alternative manufacturing 
technologies, and the development of new products that are harmless to the 
environment, such as biodegradable plastics. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy is brewing, however, over the question of who will pay for a 
cleaner environment, the cost of which no authorities have even dared estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lubbers told the foreign reporters: "Pollution is not the result 
of activities of the government. . . . We will have to pay together, as 
companies and citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"There is economic growth. Let's not add it all to profits or personal income, 
but use part of it to improve the environment." 
</P>
<P>
Industry's Kamminga, differed. He said that for the export-dependent Dutch 
industry, "an unbridled rise in the production costs . . . would be attempted 
suicide." 
</P>
<P>
"There must be a substantial government contribution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Future Worries 
</P>
<P>
"One of our major future aims will be to establish an economic structure that 
safeguards the ecological balance", says Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of 
Netherlands.

INDONESIA PULP MILL FUELS ECOLOGY SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WORRY ABOUT EFFECTS ON FISH AND RAIN FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SOSORLADANG, Indonesia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executives at the pulp mill here say the dead fish found in nearby waters were 
put there by saboteurs trying to ruin their business. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's leading environmental group, Walhi, says that fishermen are just 
one of the groups likely to suffer from the ecological damage caused by the 
mill and its forestry concessions in this remote area of northern Sumatra. 
</P>
<P>
Walhi will bring its charges to court soon, suing the government for neglecting 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
It is a chance, says Walhi, to put teeth into environmental laws and help 
protect Indonesia's vast natural heritage, which includes one of the world's 
largest remaining rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
For others, the suit is misguided at best and at worst the vehicle, unwitting 
or not, for foreign interests to sabotage the project for commercial reasons. 
Some see political motives. 
</P>
<P>
"The attacks are organized, commercially motivated. Foreigners would like to 
see things differently," said Polar Tanoto, director of PT Inti Indorayon 
Utama, which owns the mill. 
</P>
<P>
"The dead fish were a deliberate attempt to ruin this company," said another 
company official. He said some of them were sea fish never seen in the waters 
around nearby Lake Toba, a resort, and that some were even found upstream from 
the mill. 
</P>
<P>
The $185-million mill, on the bank of the Asahan River, turns trees into pulp 
for the manufacture of paper and rayon. The mill also has a license to make use 
of 370,000 acres of forest land. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Walhi official Erna Witoelar said: "The government truly believes that 
this is all an effort from the Japanese rayon industry to kill the factory." 
</P>
<P>
The mill will eventually eat into Japanese rayon exports here, said one 
Indorayon official who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Witoelar angrily denies any sinister motives or hidden backing. 
</P>
<P>
"We are handling this case only with consumer and environmental motives," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanoto said two independent studies had been made on the mill project. "There 
is no hard evidence which they (Walhi) can substantiate," he said. "We are 
confident we are doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Walhi's lawsuit contends that the government issued licenses without proper 
environmental studies. It plans to sue Indorayon later over deforestation and 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Indorayon officials say they have spent more than $30 million on waste 
recycling and environmental protection measures and their forestry operations 
are carefully managed to ensure no damage to the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Charges that changes in the forest have damaged rice irrigation are false, says 
Tanoto. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has proof that a prominent local person intentionally disrupted 
water supplies while many signatures on a letter of complaint by villagers were 
forged. 
</P>
<P>
Emil Salim, Minister for Environment and Population, defended his role and the 
pulp mill itself. "I did not fall short of my tasks," he told said in an 
interview in Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
The effluent standards for Indorayon are designed to ensure that no pollution 
damage is caused to the electricity turbines further down the Asahan River. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no environmental problem if they (the discharges) are kept at 
levels decided by the government," Salim said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the eucalyptus trees used for reforestation would improve the 
environment by helping restore falling water levels in Lake Toba. The pine 
trees being felled interfere with the natural water catchment system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he thinks the government is in the right this time, Salim said: "For 
the environment to be protected it is important to have court cases. We are 
moving to accountability from advocacy. I like to see this to educate people 
that the environment is important."

DEAF MAN, DIAGNOSED AS RETARDED, WINS SUIT BUT DOESN'T SMILE

SYRACUSE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moving like a stranger in a foreign culture, the 26-year-old man with a 
compact, athletic body weaves tentatively through a group of teen-agers 
practicing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
As he moves, Joseph McNulty keeps an eye on the coach who is gesturing 
directions. He catches a pass, dribbles once and fires at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Whoosh. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate, McNulty slaps the hands of teammates. But he doesn't smile. He 
seldom smiles. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McNulty has had little to smile about throughout his life. The 
unwanted offspring of a woman who was raped, he was misdiagnosed as retarded 
when he was only deaf and spent years in institutions and group homes. He was 
given powerful mind-altering drugs, was sexually abused and set aside as if 
barely human, his guardians claim. 
</P>
<P>
In November, a state judge ruled that New York state was guilty of medical 
malpractice and owed McNulty $1.5 million in damages. Despite a long and often 
bitter fight, the state decided not to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No Happy Ending' 
</P>
<P>
"This is something you could call a success story with no happy ending," said 
Daniel Geller, one of McNulty's therapists and his court-appointed guardian, 
the man who initiated the lawsuit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
Experts disagree on whether McNulty can be restored to what would be considered 
a normal life for a deaf person. His backers say it's possible with exhaustive 
training, but doubters call McNulty "functionally retarded" because of his 
years of deprivation and believe it can't be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"He won the lawsuit, and his life will improve somewhat," Geller said. "We'll 
get him some services, but he still has a long way to go toward achieving any 
sense of independence." 
</P>
<P>
McNulty was a "wild child" when Geller, an audiologist, first encountered him 
in 1976 at the Sunmount Developmental Center in Tupper Lake. After hours of 
arduous work, Geller noticed something that set McNulty apart from the retarded 
students he worked with: The boy was eager to learn and felt a real sense of 
accomplishment when he succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken Under Wing 
</P>
<P>
Geller took McNulty under his wing and into his home, where he lived for eight 
years while details of his treatment were argued in court. 
</P>
<P>
Unwanted by his family, McNulty was admitted in 1966 at age 4 to the infamous 
Willowbrook State Hospital on Staten Island. That institution was later forced 
to close amid reports of overcrowding, understaffing and patients lying in 
their own filth. 
</P>
<P>
State psychologists judged McNulty "an imbecile" with an IQ of 32 after giving 
him a test designed for people with normal hearing, according to court papers. 
Although subsequent examinations showed that McNulty had some hearing problems, 
records indicate that these findings were "initially ignored or simply not 
seen." As late as 1971, McNulty was taking classes for hearing people. 
</P>
<P>
As he grew up, McNulty's only role models at Willowbrook were severely retarded 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked, walked and acted like a retarded person," Geller said. "By the age 
of 14 he learned the role of a retarded person quite well because that's all he 
had been associated with." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Three Drugs at Once 
</P>
<P>
Doctors heavily dosed McNulty with a series of drugs throughout his time at 
Willowbrook. On at least one occasion, he was given Thorazine, Haldol and 
Valium at the same time, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, McNulty was sent to a family care home run by a former Willowbrook 
employee in the Upstate New York town of Theresa. While there, he was sexually 
abused by the supervisor, according to Geller and McNulty's lawyer, Joseph 
Davoli. The supervisor denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Though already a teen-ager, McNulty had no way of communicating when Geller 
began working with him. In his anger, he often tried to hit himself and those 
who wanted to help him, Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a personal tragedy, but the fact that he's deaf is not what makes it a 
tragedy," said Steve Taylor, director of Syracuse University's Center on Human 
Policy, which studies human rights issues for the disabled. "No human being, 
whether he's deaf, mentally retarded or anything else, should have to go 
through what Joe McNulty went through." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IQ Scores Improve 
</P>
<P>
Geller and his wife, fellow therapist Deena Butcher, began intensive work with 
McNulty. Through a battery of tests in the late 1970s, his IQ scores slowly 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a June, 1980, evaluation by Dr. Robert Platt, the state psychologist, 
concluded that McNulty was of average intelligence and not mentally retarded. 
He scored poorly on tests not because he wasn't smart, but because he simply 
wasn't used to taking tests, Platt said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the court fight began. 
</P>
<P>
The case was marked by such mistrust that lawyers wouldn't let doctors for the 
competing side evaluate McNulty without other doctors watching through a 
one-way mirror. Court of Claims Judge Jerome Hanifin wryly noted in his 
159-page decision that "the fewer psychologists that he (McNulty) sees in the 
future, the better." 
</P>
<P>
State doctors argued that McNulty was in fact retarded, while McNulty's lawyers 
contended that he was actually slightly above average in intelligence but had 
become mildly retarded because of the state's mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Mild Brain Dysfunction' 
</P>
<P>
The truth, Hanifin wrote, was somewhere in between. McNulty, he said, has a 
"mild brain dysfunction" that interfered with his ability to learn. The state's 
chief fault, he said, was not its failure to recognize McNulty's intelligence, 
but in not harnessing the boy's willingness to learn. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, the state maintained that McNulty received proper care 
from the time he first entered Willowbrook. In light of Hanifin's decision, 
state officials no longer claim that they were right, but aren't quite saying 
they were wrong, either. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge made a decision and said certain things and by not appealing, we've 
accepted that," said Louis Ganim, spokesman for the state's Office of Mental 
Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
New York state fought McNulty's case tenaciously not so much because of the 
money, but for fear that it could unleash a torrent of similar cases, Taylor 
said. Scott Greathead, the state's first assistant attorney general, said New 
York is mandated by law to challenge such claims. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Must Pay for Therapy 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 million, which will be reduced by more than a third after legal fees 
are taken out, really isn't much considering that it has to pay for McNulty's 
living expenses and therapy for the rest of his life, Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
"The damages that were awarded to him really can't compensate for the terrible 
things that have happened to him in his life," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
McNulty joined in a champagne toast after winning the lawsuit, but he didn't 
really grasp the concept of the victory. In a child-like scrawl, he wrote to 
Davoli: "Thank you for helping me win money. Now I can learn many new things." 
</P>
<P>
His guardians are still wrangling with the state over McNulty's current living 
arrangements. With a growing family, Geller could no longer care for McNulty 
and the state placed him in a supervised apartment with three deaf and mentally 
retarded people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Placement 
</P>
<P>
Davoli said it doesn't make sense for McNulty to continue to live with mentally 
retarded people. But Ganim said the placement is appropriate because McNulty's 
"level of performance" is the same as his apartment-mates. 
</P>
<P>
McNulty works an assembly line job, cutting reinforced vinyl. Realistically, he 
can't hope for much more challenging work in the future, Hanifin said.

He communicates through sign language and relishes the chance to get away from 
his structured life, either to practice with the church basketball team Davoli 
coaches or shoot pool with the lawyer's kids. With a few breaks, the cat-quick 
McNulty could have been a professional athlete, Davoli said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what he can achieve," he said. "There's untapped potential in 
his mind, but it's been so muddled and confused and abused. It's difficult to 
determine what affect that abuse will have on unlocking the door."

SURVIVAL SKILLS LEARNED IN THE ASPHALT JUNGLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a wall in the small office of Rudy Rodrigues, a leader of Outward Bound, 
hangs a detailed map of the wilderness that his charges must conquer in pursuit 
of survival through self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
This challenge is particularly tough. The map is of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
America's large cities are asphalt jungles all right, at least in metaphor. But 
for more than a quarter-century in America, Outward Bound has evoked images of 
well-heeled executives and well-scrubbed youths in expensive hiking boots 
breathing clean air on faraway mountains. 
</P>
<P>
So what's a nice program like that doing in a place like this? 
</P>
<P>
"It's long overdue," says Rodrigues, "or would appear so from the results of 
our first year. This is no experiment. We're committed now, and going all out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return to Principles 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Rodrigues says, urban Outward Bound programs are a return to first 
principles. The organization was founded to teach resourcefulness, confidence, 
compassion, perseverance and self-esteem, but always has tried to include the 
ideal of service as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to stress the service ideal in the wilderness," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional Outward Bound schools cater to the more privileged, so this is 
a shift from the traditional. In the city, we serve. Our focus right now is on 
inner-city youth and the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Serving, Outward Bound crews have renovated shelters, picnicked with homeless 
children, distributed food. But, on the theory that most urban discord results 
from people of varied ethnic and economic stripes threatening and fearing one 
another, relieving social tensions, Rodrigues feels, might be the best service 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Outward Bound is so satisfied with its work in concrete canyons that a 
staff is already setting up a similar program in Chicago and others are planned 
in Boston, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Haves and Have-Nots 
</P>
<P>
A typical New York Outward Bound program matches a dozen or so corporate 
executives with an equal number of disadvantaged persons of various ages and 
cultures and turns them all loose on the town for a few days with an 
instructor. 
</P>
<P>
The haves live, work and discourse with the have-nots, an unlikely get-together 
in any town. The haves, moreover, must make do without cab fare, credit cards 
or carpet slippers. 
</P>
<P>
They will sleep outdoors in blankets, walk where they want to go or ride the 
subway if they have a token. They find meals as best they can and as cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
Without exception, participants report that the experience gave them a new, 
less judgmental perception of the lower crust, even a bond with them, and thus 
a clearer view of the city's social problems. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, the inner-city folk discarded long-held prejudices among 
themselves. "Black kids and Hispanic kids in New York grow up believing that 
white kids are weak," one 18-year-old black reported. White participants 
weren't aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporations Pay 
</P>
<P>
The corporation picks up the Outward Bound tuition for its own execs and also 
for their classmates, $60 a day each, same fee as the traditional courses out 
yonder. 
</P>
<P>
The course relies on proven wilderness techniques transferred to the cityscape 
with, of course, some compromises. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of testing endurance by dashing across mountain meadows, for example, 
the New Yorkers take laps around the Central Park reservoir. Instead of going 
hand over hand across a chasm, they climb in the rigging of a four-master at 
the South Street Seaport museum. Instead of a white-water raft adventure, they 
row an eight-oar lifeboat up the East River. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons apparently have the same results. One graduate says: "In the boat, 
all of us were strangers, but until we discovered that we had to pull together 
we went in circles." 
</P>
<P>
On one expedition, 18 men and youths recruited from a shelter for the homeless 
in Harlem were taken to Ft. Tryon Park -- not exactly Yosemite, but it did 
afford a 40-foot rock wall. All 18 scaled it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Were Selfish' 
</P>
<P>
"In the shelter," one recalled afterward, "we didn't trust one another. We 
fought. We were selfish. 
</P>
<P>
"Out there on that rock there was a guy on top with a rope, and my safety 
depended on him. When it was over, the relationship we had with one another was 
totally different." 
</P>
<P>
That lesson, and even more so the lifeboat lesson, harks back to the origin of 
Outward Bound. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, the head of a British shipping firm, Lawrence Holt, 
decided that too many of his sailors, despite lifeboats, were being lost at sea 
when their ships were sunk. 
</P>
<P>
He consulted Kurt Hahn, operator of a prominent boys' school. Hahn, in 1941, 
opened a school in Wales to teach young mariners self-confidence, small-boat 
handling, route-finding, rescue -- and community service. 
</P>
<P>
Holt named the program Outward Bound, a nautical term for the point at which a 
ship leaves safe harbor for the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
Now Outward Bound programs thrive in 36 countries. Only two others, Britain and 
the Netherlands, include urban programs, but according to Rodrigues, the New 
York director, neither has the scope of the New York operation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Programs Planned 
</P>
<P>
"We conducted 10 programs last year, and so far this year we have planned 16 
weekend courses and two 16-day courses which will be a blend of the wilderness 
and the city," he says. "These will run April through November." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, says Rodrigues, beaming, his curriculum includes continuing programs 
in four of New York's polyglot high schools that have had racial and ethnic 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
The high school programs, not surprisingly in New York, use techniques of the 
theater. Students act out roles, exposing bigotries and foolish fears. The 
results are especially satisfying to the executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Rodrigues was born in Kenya in 1941 when it was a British colony. His 
father was a British civil servant, born in Goa, a Portuguese colony in India. 
His mother was born in Karachi, then a part of India. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeans for the Office 
</P>
<P>
Rodrigues is a lean, swarthy man with vivid brown eyes behind aviator glasses. 
A mane of thick, black, curly hair lit with strands of silver brushes the neck 
of his sweater. Jeans and sweaters are the work clothes of his staff as well, 
in characteristic contrast with the three-piece suits and straight skirts 
predominant in the mid-town Manhattan skyscraper where they work. 
</P>
<P>
'When I was a boy," Rodrigues was saying the other day, "all the various races 
in Kenya lived and grew up and worked in isolation of one another. After 10th 
grade, I went to Outward Bound. It was my first opportunity to be together with 
people of different races and backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my instructors was a British army officer. He kept talking about this 
place called Sandhurst, the Royal Military Academy. He told us only the best, 
the creme de la creme, could get in. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was a kid from a colony, non-English. What chance had I? But because of 
my Outward Bound experience I decided, hell, I think I'll go. I knew it was up 
to me. So I went." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fascinated by Possibilities 
</P>
<P>
After an army tour and a stint with the United Nations fighting famine, 
Rodrigues moved to New York. The notion of an urban Outward Bound program 
fascinated him. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the urban backdrop has a much more exciting dynamic to it than the 
wilderness," he says.

A fire ripped through an aging residential hotel early Friday, killing four 
people and injuring nearly 60 others, including four police officers, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said it appears the four-alarm blaze started in an apartment on 
the first floor of the Billinghurst Hotel, forcing many trapped residents to 
jump from upper-story windows. The blaze was under investigation.

TEMBLOR MESSAGE MOVES FROM DOORWAY TO UNDER A DESK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conventional wisdom says that during an earthquake, you run to the nearest 
doorway and stay there until the shaking stops. 
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of earthquake preparedness experts are suggesting, 
however, that people take shelter under a desk or table in an approach called 
"Duck, Cover and Hold." 
</P>
<P>
This approach is crucial in high-rise buildings where many interior walls may 
buckle during an earthquake because they are not attached to structural beams, 
said Michael Durkin, a USC architecture professor who has completed several 
studies on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Something That Offers Protection' 
</P>
<P>
"If you are going to get under something," Durkin said, "you need to get under 
something that offers protection." 
</P>
<P>
Doorways can also be hazardous in homes because the shaking can slam doors into 
people or objects can fly across the room and injure them, several experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where you take cover depends on the design of the structure," said Paul 
Flores, director of the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project. 
"We were concerned that giving the straight recommendation to get under a 
doorway may not be the best thing. . . . Getting under a heavy piece of 
furniture in a couple of seconds is the best recommendation you can give 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, "Duck, Cover and Hold" was promoted at an earthquake preparedness 
conference in South Gate, attended by about 300 school officials from Southeast 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the approach works: When an earthquake begins, duck beneath a desk 
or table, crouch in a fetal position, cover your head by locking the elbows 
tight to your ears and hold onto a leg of the desk or table with both hands. 
</P>
<P>
Crouching underneath will enable you to shield most or all of the body with the 
desk. The arms protect the head and face from flying objects. Holding on is 
important because a temblor may move even heavy furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"Duck, Cover and Hold" is a modification of the "drop and cover" bomb drills 
that schoolchildren practiced in the 1960s. In 1984, the California Legislature 
mandated earthquake preparedness in all public schools. Drop drills made a 
comeback. In part because of Durkin's research, the new approach has moved 
beyond the school grounds in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
Since about 1982, Durkin has studied how people were injured during earthquakes 
in Mexico, Chile and California. Dramatic testimony about the reliability of 
furniture as shields emerged from the 1983 earthquake in Mexico City where 
desks were the only thing that kept floors of buildings from collapsing on each 
other like stacks of pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. construction standards are superior to those of Mexico, Durkin 
said there is no proof that people are better off standing in doorways during 
earthquakes. In some cases, he said, standing in doorways has resulted in 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"People who stand in the front door of a building that is unreinforced are 
subject to getting hit by things falling off the front walls," Durkin said. "I 
don't think there are a lot of strong doorway advocates around." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others Join Movement 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project, others 
joining the "Duck, Cover and Hold" movement include the Bay Area Regional 
Earthquake Preparedness Project in Northern California, the Downey-based 
Earthquake Preparedness Society and the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
But one group that still promotes doorways is the American Red Cross. Pat 
Snyder, the group's national chairwoman of disaster services, said "the jury is 
still out" on whether desks are better than doorways. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hesitant to change the message (about doorways) based on Durkin's 
studies," Snyder said. "If it were a larger study, I think I would have more 
confidence in it." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross and other agencies are trying to avoid complicated directions for 
what to do during a tremor, she said. "I hate giving people too many choices. 
It's too confusing," she said. "People won't remember anything. . . . I feel we 
should all be singing from the same sheet of music." 
</P>
<P>
However, Snyder said her personal first choice would be to take cover under a 
desk or counter. "It's the falling things that are going to get you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores recommended that if there is no piece of heavy furniture available, 
people should take refuge in a hallway free from the threat of flying glass or 
crouch next to a wall. 
</P>
<P>
When outdoors, people should assume a face-down fetal position on the ground 
and cover their heads with their arms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said Durkin's research is mostly responsible for more people boarding 
the "Duck, Cover and Hold" bandwagon, but Henry Johnson of the Los Angeles Fire 
Department said there is also engineering research to support the new approach. 
</P>
<P>
The doorway recommendation is based on "old knowledge about old buildings," 
said Johnson, a fire and safety specialist with the department. "This change is 
a natural response to our new information on earthquakes and what they do to 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to safety advantages, some quake preparedness experts believe that 
there are psychological benefits to "Duck, Cover and Hold." Being trained to 
duck and hold on rather than stumble to a doorway makes people feel less like 
victims of a temblor, said Jan Smith, emergency services coordinator for 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say that trying to brace myself in a moving door frame is going to 
allow me the psychological comfort that I would have holding on to a desk and 
having some control over my body," said Smith, who designed an earthquake 
preparedness program for Ventura County's 22 school districts. 
</P>
<P>
"I now look at a doorway and say, 'It's not a structural problem. It's a 
psychological problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
Durkin's studies also found that in cases other than a building collapse, most 
earthquake injuries occur when people trip or are hit by falling objects as 
they run outside or to a doorway. He suggested that people take a few seconds 
to assess the situation and decide where to go rather than taking panicky 
actions that can result in injury. 
</P>
<P>
Several specialists warned against telling people that they absolutely have to 
be either under a doorway or a desk. In fact, Durkin said a major finding of 
his studies is that "people have different kinds of risks, depending on the 
kinds of physical settings they live and work in."

EPILEPTIC SEA LION FINALLY GETS TENDER-LOVING HOME IN HOUSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Her admirers describe her as "intelligent," "beautiful," "gentle" and "very 
people-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
The lady in question is Carly, a 5 1/2-year-old, 250-pound epileptic sea lion 
who has spent the last 18 months at Friends of the Sea Lion's spacious Marine 
Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, awaiting a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
Because of her disease -- controlled now by daily doses of fresh herring laced 
with phenobarbital -- "Carly could never be returned to the ocean," said Judi 
Jones, Marine Mammal Center director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
And because of her epilepsy, zoos across the country weren't interested in 
taking the sleek, silver-brown animal, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, Friends of the Sea Lion announced that Carly finally has a 
home. Last Tuesday, Carly and Cat, a sea lion from the Los Angeles Zoo, flew to 
Texas, courtesy of Continental Airlines. There, along with two other sea lions 
and two harbor seals, they will be the main attractions in the Houston Zoo's 
just-completed $400,000 McGovern Mammal Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Carly's friendly personality was the main reason she was selected, said David 
Ruhter, the Houston Zoo's curator of mammals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the animals that were offered to us were biters and didn't like 
people at all," Ruhter said. Carly, on the other hand, is "personable" and 
should be easy to train, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhter said he doesn't plan to do circus tricks with Carly, such as having her 
jump through hoops. But he does want to be able to touch her easily and have 
her sit still for public presentations about sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Beach center last Monday, Carly showed reporters and a dozen 
children some of her stuff. At Jones' urging, she sloshed in and out of the 
rock-lined pool, returning again and again to Jones' side. However, she 
declined to "kiss" Jones, opting instead to stand on her rear flippers and 
touch her nose to Jones' nose, said to be a favorite trick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rations Cut Back 
</P>
<P>
Carly was "nervous," Jones explained. To make sure she would not be airsick on 
her flight, Carly was being given less than her usual 4-pound-a-day ration of 
herring, so she sensed that something was up. She was hungry and she was also a 
little angry, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Carly emphasized the point, slapping wet flippers past photographers and 
reporters, and barking, "Hrrmph." 
</P>
<P>
Jones and Bill Ford, center executive officer, emphasized that most of the 100 
or so sick and injured sea lions that they rehabilitate each year are returned 
to the ocean -- and not trained to be friendly to humans. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ford: "We don't interact socially with animals that are going to be 
released to the ocean because we don't want them to think that all humans will 
be friendly to them -- because they're not." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual pattern over the last month, the bodies of 49 sea lions drifted 
onto Orange County beaches. Federal biologists have said that evidence so far 
indicates that most of the sea lions died in the gill nets of halibut fishermen 
but that some were probably shot by other fishermen chasing squid off 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Carly's saga apparently did not involve fishermen. In 1984, when she was a year 
old, she somehow became stranded on a San Diego beach and was captured by Sea 
World, Jones said. She was then sent to a UC Santa Cruz animal behavior lab 
that has been studying the abilities of dolphins and sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
"They think she hit her head up there. That's when she started having 
seizures," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Carly came to a rock-lined pool at Laguna Beach's Marine 
Mammal Center. At the time, she was taking Dilantin, which partly controlled 
her seizures. But Jones said that when she switched Carly to phenobarbital (120 
milligrams twice a day, delivered in the gills of a herring), the seizures 
stopped altogether. (An average dose for an adult epileptic human weighing 160 
to 180 pounds is 180 milligrams a day, according to UCI Medical Center 
spokeswoman Elaine Beno. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was excited that Carly finally has a permanent home but sad to see her 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like losing a friend. I wish that I could go with her," she said. "I've 
seen a lot of sea lions. But she really has a pretty face."

HUNTINGTON BEACH STUDENTS TOIL ON CAMPUS TO LEARN TV CRAFT

<P>
Inside the TV control room, the 16-year-old program director, Paul Lear, spoke 
into his headset. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, quiet on the set. Coming up on Camera 1, then cut to 2." 
</P>
<P>
In the adjoining TV studio, the camera crew and on-camera talent tried not to 
show fatigue or irritation. The slate man held up a card that read: "Take No. 
17." A young woman quickly glanced at her cue card. The red light on Camera 1 
flashed on. The young woman smiled and recited her lines -- one more time. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the new CBS-TV network series, "TV 101," about fictional high school 
news broadcasters, this is the real thing. Huntington Beach High School has 
been doing it for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Like TV Series 
</P>
<P>
Louis Polley watched from the hall outside Huntington High's TV newsroom. "It's 
not at all like they show it on that new program, 'TV 101,' " he said. "In that 
show, it seems like they get a take done in three or four minutes. It often 
takes me three or four hours just to do a three-minute segment." 
</P>
<P>
Polley, 16, a junior at Huntington Beach High, is among the on-camera 
performers used in the school's weekly TV news-magazine show, "1905 Main." 
</P>

"1905 Main St. is the address of our high school," TV teacher Don Messerschmitt 
said. "We used to call the program 'Campus Update.' This year we changed the 
format. It's now more about things in the community, outside the high school, 
and it's a little more sophisticated. So we've changed the name, and we have a 
new set." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach High is among the few schools in Southern California with an 
on-campus TV studio. 
</P>
<P>
"We got our equipment about 10 years ago with a federal grant," Messerschmitt 
said. "Our school wanted to teach kids about the television business and give 
them hands-on experience even before they get to college. It's a very popular 
class, and our kids often go on to major in this in college." 
</P>
<P>
At Huntington Beach High, the weekly 15-minute news program is taped for 
broadcast on Fridays to all classrooms in the school. Each week's tape is also 
given to county cable outlets; it is broadcast on Channel 30 at 4 p.m. on 
Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how many people see the (cable) broadcast and tell me about it," 
said Jenny Casey, 16, a junior and one of the on-camera anchors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Product of the Students 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach High news program is written, directed and produced by 
students. Messerschmitt and another instructor, John Colby, stand by on the set 
to give advice and pointers. But the students operate cameras, write scripts, 
compose original theme music, build props and voice all speaking roles. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural show of the new format included a segment on the national debate 
about whether the right to legal abortion should be overturned in the United 
States. The segment gave background about the U.S. Supreme Court's historic 
abortion ruling, Roe vs. Wade. There were film clips of President Bush and Vice 
President Dan Quayle and their comments opposing abortion during the 1988 
presidential campaign. Interspersed were a balanced number of anti-abortion and 
pro-choice comments by Huntington Beach students. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the kids in the high school said they didn't like the first show," 
Messerschmitt said. "They said it was too heavy. But the faculty loved it." 
</P>
<P>
The second "1905 Main" program had a segment about forthcoming changes in a 
national fast-food franchise popular with students. There were also segments on 
the history of Valentine's Day and awards won by the rock band Guns and Roses. 
</P>
<P>
Messerschmitt noted that the show always has campus news too, such as sports 
updates. 
</P>
<P>
During a Thursday taping, anchor Kristin Moyer, 18, a senior, went through take 
after take on the rock-band segment until Lear, the young director, was 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it's a pressure job," said Lear, a sophomore, during a break. "But it's 
fun, and I like to be in command, as everybody in this classroom knows. You 
have to watch your temper, though." 
</P>
<P>
Anchorwoman Moyer said she accepts the long hours of taping as part of the 
learning and enjoys the class. "This is what I really like to do," she said. 
"I'm going to take this in college. Then I think it'd be fun to come back to a 
high school and teach a class like this." 
</P>
<P>
One of the student studio technicians, Allen MacDonald, 16, said: "It's great 
to be able to work with real equipment and get the experience." 
</P>
<P>
Studio floor manager Tina Haines, 18, a senior, added: "Having experience like 
this will help me in college. I'm going to major in this." 
</P>
<P>
Messerschmitt said few high schools can afford to buy the TV equipment that 
Huntington Beach High obtained a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Since many students at other high schools in Orange County want to take this 
class, we allow transfers to come to Huntington so they can get this 
experience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Up to 20 Hours a Week 
</P>
<P>
But he added that the course involves a lot of work. Students often devote up 
to 20 hours a week in their part of the news show. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very dedicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday taping was a case in point. News anchor Jenny Casey had been sick 
with flu but showed up for the TV class nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
"This, to me, is like a job," Casey said. "It's like a duty. So, yes, I'm still 
sick, but I wasn't about to miss this class." 
</P>

IN THE SHADOWS OF DARKNESS, THE HUNTERS BECOME THE HUNTED

When the man came up to him in the canyon area known as Big Bang, Fred Stevens 
became suspicious. No undocumented immigrant, Stevens reasoned, would have 
approached him as this man did in May, 1985, in the rugged terrain that 
separates San Diego from Tijuana, the Third World from the First. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been too long in those canyons," Stevens, a U. S. Border Patrol agent at 
the time, testified during a recent federal court hearing. People, he said, 
"only approach each other when they have some other interest." 
</P>
<P>
Stevens decided the man was "dirty," probably a thief; he braced himself for an 
assault. He used his walkie-talkie to alert other officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to get the helicopter on standby, our support," Stevens recalled 
in another court proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing shoot-out, Stevens was shot five times; a bulletproof vest 
probably saved his life. The suspect, a former Mexico City state policeman, was 
dead on the canyon floor, the fatal shot a single bullet in the forehead from a 
9-millimeter pistol. An attorney would later contend that the man was summarily 
executed by police, an allegation rejected by authorities and, last month, by a 
federal jury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloodiest Police Squad 
</P>
<P>
It was another night on the beat for one of the nation's most singular -- and 
bloodiest -- police squads: The Border Crime Prevention Unit, composed of 
volunteers drawn from the ranks of the San Diego Police Department and U. S. 
Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The border outfit has been controversial since its creation. Some have 
maintained that officers should not be risking their lives protecting people 
who are in the country illegally. Others say the unit precipitates more 
violence than it prevents. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities insist otherwise, saying that the officers' presence is an 
effective deterrent of crime against a most vulnerable population. 
</P>
<P>
"These are human beings, and they're being victimized," Police Chief Bob 
Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
The joint city-federal unit was created in early 1984, when reports of border 
robberies, rapes and murders were on the rise. Unlike the legendary undercover 
San Diego police task force that patrolled the area from 1976 to 1978, the new 
unit was to be a uniformed, high-profile squad. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say standard police techniques would not serve in the border area, 
where there are few paved roads, telephones, fixed residences or named streets. 
(Geographic points are given nicknames such as Maggie's Drawers, the Mousetrap, 
Washer Woman Flats, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, officials opted for a hybrid police-military model, a kind of 
mini-commando squad. "This is more like a tactical military operation," 
Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the initial supervisors, Border Patrol Agent Stevens and San Diego 
Police Sgt. Hank Olais, were ex-Army paratroopers. Stevens had served three 
tours in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The patrol's two "teams" are designated as Alpha and Bravo; each generally 
consists of five or six officers. During patrols, a "Charlie" team, consisting 
of one or two officers, stays behind with a vehicle, ready to provide more 
equipment or support as needed. 
</P>
<P>
One lawman on each team, designated the "shotgunner," covers the rear and is 
armed with a shotgun. Officials at first contemplated using assault rifles, but 
rejected the military weapons as too dangerous. A "point man," generally a 
Spanish-speaker, is first in line in each team. The team leader, a senior 
officer, is usually next. A "bagman" totes a sack with flares and binoculars. 
Each officer generally carries two weapons, typically semiautomatic 
9-millimeter pistols. 
</P>
<P>
(The weapons wielded by thieves vary greatly. Of the 14 fatal shooting 
incidents involving the unit, which left 18 suspects dead, real guns were found 
in five cases. In five other instances authorities reported discovering other 
weapons, ranging from BB guns to an air rifle to a screwdriver to a stick 
disguised to look like a shotgun. On four other occasions investigators 
discovered toy weapons near the victims.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beat Covers Wide Swath 
</P>
<P>
The "beat" of the border outfit is among the city's largest geographically: On 
a given evening, officers may be patrolling anywhere within about an 
8-mile-long, half-mile-wide swath of international frontier. On some occasions, 
it even patrols areas several miles to the north that are also traversed by the 
migrants. 
</P>
<P>
Before embarking each evening (the unit patrols five nights a week), the unit 
has an intelligence briefing at the cramped police headquarters in the border 
community of San Ysidro, less than half a mile from the border. There, they 
hear reports culled from police, Border Patrol agents and other sources 
regarding robberies and other crimes in the canyons. 
</P>
<P>
With a specific destination in mind, the teams "insert" -- that is, are dropped 
off by four-wheel-drive vehicles -- at specific border locations. They then 
begin walking in staggered single file toward a specific area where they have 
received reports of criminal activity. Alpha team begins the patrol, followed 
about 10 minutes later by Bravo squad. The officers are equipped with 
flashlights, walkie-talkies and night-vision devices to facilitate observation. 
The lawmen often set up surveillance at suspected trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
Their dress is inspected every evening, authorities say. Police officers don 
khaki outfits with cloth badges outside of their uniforms; border agents wear 
regular, heavy-weight green "rough duty" uniforms, with metal badges visible. 
All wear bulletproof vests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'High Visibility' 
</P>
<P>
"We were high visibility," recalled Olais, the police sergeant, who was 
involved in six shootings during his seven months with the unit in 1984. "We'd 
fly the flag. We didn't hide the fact that we were police officers. We'd walk 
up to people and befriend them; we'd talk to the guides." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmen readily acknowledge that the canyons are a dark, nerve-wrenching 
experience, even for armed officers, a place where every shadow can represent a 
threat. "It's a scary place," said Border Patrol agent Dana Cunningham, who 
served on the unit last year. "If you don't possess a controlled fear, then 
you're neglecting your job." 
</P>
<P>
Olais added: "I was scared every night. I think I said the name of each apostle 
every night. I did a lot of praying." 
</P>
<P>
While on patrol, the lawmen maintain a kind of safety zone around them. Anyone 
approaching them within 15 feet is viewed with suspicion. Officers snap their 
fingers to alert colleagues to potentially dangerous persons. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a bandit, he's probably casing us," said Sgt. Joseph T. Wood, a former 
unit supervisor who was interviewed recently in the unit's small room in a 
trailer-like facility behind the police station in San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
In the canyons, split-second decisions are the rule. In each of the 14 
fatal-shooting incidents, authorities said that the border lawmen didn't open 
fire until the suspects were wielding, and apparently preparing to use, 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a guy just turns up to you from nowhere and starts shooting," 
recalled Sgt. Olais, now attached to the homicide squad. 
</P>
<P>
But, in only two of the 14 fatal-shooting cases did suspects fire before they 
were shot by the lawmen, according to police and written accounts of the 
shootings by the San Diego County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fact of life, officers say, that, despite their uniforms and badges, 
robbers do attempt to assault them, apparently mistaking the lawmen for 
border-crossers in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm dumbfounded sometimes why they're not able to identify us as police," said 
Sgt. Wood, seated in the unit's office. A starter's pistol and a phony 
sawed-off shotgun taken from robbers hang on the walls next to the squad 
members' gray metal lockers. "I don't want us to get into a fire fight with 
someone who wants to rob us for 25 cents." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics have suggested that unit officers, contrary to their statements, 
do attempt to conceal their identities. In at least one fatal shooting, a 
Border Patrol officer assigned to the unit acknowledged during court testimony 
that he was attempting to appear like an illegal alien -- in apparent violation 
of unit guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, police say, drugs have impaired the thieves' judgment. But 
autopsies indicate that only three of the 18 dead suspects had taken controlled 
substances before being shot; two had ingested cocaine and one showed signs of 
barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
At least one suspected robber, Enrique Estrada Rodriguez, should have known 
better. He was shot and wounded in March, 1988, when he and three others 
attempted to assault the unit near a concrete flood-control levee along the 
Tijuana River, police said. One of his confederates was killed. Almost nine 
months later, in about the same location, Estrada himself was shot dead, along 
with another suspected robber, when he attempted to assault the patrol, 
authorities said. His body showed 13 bullet wounds. 
</P>
<P>
Officers volunteer for the four-month assignments on the border unit; there is 
never a shortage of sign-ups, officials say. Authorities say they limit each 
volunteer to two tours, or eight months of service. Supervisors say they screen 
applicants for their ability to handle the special assignment. A number of 
women have served. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see any signs of stress -- if someone just had a baby, if their dad died, 
if they're going through a divorce, whatever, I'll remove them from duty," said 
San Diego Police Capt. Dick Toneck, who heads the southern police division, 
where the squad is based. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want any Rambos," said Sgt. Wood. 
</P>
<P>
What attracts officers about the assignment? 
</P>
<P>
"You get a chance to get out there and defend defenseless people," said agent 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receive Specialized Training 
</P>
<P>
The border officers receive a specialized two-week training course that 
involves marksmanship, police tactics and more specialized skills -- such as 
rudimentary Spanish. Unlike the previous outfit, which was mostly composed of 
Latino officers, there is no requirement that officers speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
A key skill taught to recruits is the ability to distinguish the behavior of 
robbers -- universally described as cocky, self-confident and brash -- from the 
typical comportment of aliens, who are generally submissive, eager to head 
north and likely to avoid contact with other groups, according to authorities. 
In most fatal shootings, officers noted that the behavior or appearance of the 
suspected robbers was the initial indicator of criminal intent -- sometimes 
because of the way they dressed, sometimes because of their movements, or 
sometimes because of their defiant behavior. Attorneys representing shooting 
victims have questioned the officers' criteria as subjective, but authorities 
defend their ability to distinguish would-be robbers. 
</P>
<P>
In a shooting that occurred Dec. 20, 1987, for instance, officers noted 
something amiss about two suspects loitering near the border fence. "One had a 
bandanna up over his mouth and nose and the second . . . was wearing a knit ski 
cap atop his head," wrote Deputy San Diego County Dist. Atty. Brian E. Michaels 
in his summary of the case. "Their attire and conduct was atypical of illegal 
aliens crossing the border, and consistent with the officers' experience with 
robbery suspects in the area." 
</P>
<P>
The two men eventually tried to rob the officers, police said. One of the two 
was shot and killed as he gestured with what appeared to be a weapon, according 
to the police account. A toy gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
When trouble arises, retaliation can be harsh. At least five of the 18 suspects 
killed by the unit had nine or more bullet wounds, according to autopsy 
reports. At least half of the dead men were shot from behind, a fact that 
authorities say is not unusual in the dark, highly charged setting, in which 
many officers are firing from different angles. 
</P>
<P>
The body of one suspected robber, Francisco Antonio Bernal Moreno, 23, who was 
shot in April, 1986, had 21 gunshot wounds, according to the post-mortem. 
During the autopsy, buckshot and bullet fragments fell from his clothing. 
Bernal was armed with a "realistic-appearing" weapon that turned out to be a BB 
pistol, the district attorney found. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 dead robbery suspects, all were men and all were believed to be 
Mexican citizens in the United States illegally. (One remains unidentified.) 
Most were in their late teens or early 20s. Among the dead men, according to 
their listed occupations, were a baker, a fish vendor, a construction worker, a 
cook, an upholsterer -- and the former Mexico City state policeman who opened 
fire on Border Patrol agent Stevens.

WHY DO BLACKS EXPECT WHITES TO HONOR DR. KING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SUKUMU, Vernon Sukumu is executive director of the Black Federation 
of San Diego and was an aide to former City Councilman William Jones when the 
council voted to change the name of Market Street to Martin Luther King Way. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I will begin by saying that I believe the great majority of the black community 
would be pleased if the convention center is named in honor of Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. I believe also that naming the convention center for King would 
have a liberation effect on whites. It would break down another barrier just as 
Jackie Robinson did for baseball and as Tom Bradley has done as the mayor of 
predominantly white Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Whites need to understand that blacks have historically accepted white heroes 
and blacks' tax dollars have been used to support monuments to white heroes, 
from Washington and Lincoln to Jack Murphy, Cabrillo, Father Serra and others. 
We have accepted these monuments without questioning. For most of that history 
we were not allowed to develop as human beings, let alone develop heroes. 
</P>
<P>
If the premise that honorific figures are important, then everyone with common 
sense and decency would understand why King is important to us and why many 
blacks wish that others would accept our hero as we have theirs. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the majority of whites don't accept that premise, then what are we 
as a black community to do? 
</P>
<P>
It's important for us to make a distinction between substantive and symbolic 
issues. Like King, we should demand the right to work, live, vote and have 
equal access to the goods and services of the society. On the other hand, while 
the convention center is an important symbol, is it worth the pain of going 
through another Market Street fiasco? 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt to anyone living on the planet Earth that, once the 
convention center is named for King, an initiative will be placed on the ballot 
and King's name will be removed by the voters of San Diego. (I hope I am 
wrong!) 
</P>
<P>
I am not questioning the motive of those who think the convention center would 
be a suitable replacement after the Market Street defeat. I am only asking, 
what has happened in this city since the Market Street vote that would lead us 
to believe that the outcome this time will be any different? I am questioning 
why we continue to put our feelings, dignity and self-worth at the feet of 
people who would trample on them. 
</P>
<P>
As a people, blacks must embrace those symbolic issues that are as important to 
us as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish and Cinco de Mayo is to the Mexicans. 
But we cannot rely on others to honor those symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Luther King had a universal message of peace and nonviolence that helped 
free us from an oppressive society. But King's message was never universally 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
If, by their actions, San Diegans do not accept his message, then they are 
unlikely to accept him as a hero to be honored. Again, I hope I am wrong, but 
if King's name is stripped from the convention center, then the black community 
must begin to look inward for a way to honor King's memory that does not 
require approval by the community at large.

TOXIC TIME BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been seven years since the solvent-recycling business operated by Robert 
and Thomas Chatham in Escondido was declared a hazardous waste site. 
</P>
<P>
It has been four years since the voters of California approved $100 million in 
bonds to start cleanup on 50 of the 323 such sites around the state, of which 
Chatham Brothers is one of the 20 most serious. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 2 1/2 years since state toxic cleanup crews started the preliminary 
work to determine how much contamination there was, how far it had spread and 
how best to clean it up. At that time, state officials estimated that the 
preliminary work would take about three months. 
</P>
<P>
Yet today that preliminary work is still going on, and the state's most 
optimistic projections are that removal of the drums of waste and contaminated 
soil won't start until late this year. And that is contingent on federal 
approval to dump the waste at a landfill, which was restricted in November. 
</P>
<P>
If that approval is not granted, when Chatham will be cleaned up is anyone's 
guess, because there is not enough of the $100 million left for the more 
expensive incineration of the wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this lengthy delay is a necessary part of cleaning up highly toxic 
substances such as heavy metals and cancer-causing PCBs, which must be done 
with great care to avoid harming nearby residents or cleanup crews. 
</P>
<P>
But we think that Escondido residents, the Escondido City Council and the 
county have good reason to criticize the delays and to question the efficiency 
of state procedures. 
</P>
<P>
By its own admissions, the state Department of Health Services has stumbled 
several times and been tripped up by internal problems and changes in personnel 
and strategy. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, one of the reasons that the preliminary studies are still not 
completed is because the decision to test the extent of ground-water 
contamination was not made until late in the process. Meanwhile, every day that 
the gooey wastes sit in the soil, the chances of ground-water contamination 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
The time has come to cut through the bureaucratic delays and find a way to 
clean up the Chatham Brothers site. The Escondido City Council and the county 
have some good ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis' proposal that the city take on the cleanup task 
might be too ambitious, but the council's decision to prod federal and state 
officials to look at alternative ways to clean up the site might provide the 
kind of leadership that the state has failed to show.

Two men have been arrested in the slaying of a Ramona man, a Sheriff's 
Department spokesman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Devies Miller, 42, of Ramona and Thomas Gilbert Costa, 40, of Santa 
Ysabel were arrested at Miller's home Friday in connection with the shooting 
death of Benjamin Gomez-Munoz, 29, said Lt. Bill Baxter of the homicide 
division. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, Gomez-Munoz and three companions were riding in a 
vehicle near Miller's home Friday, when Gomez-Munoz's car caught fire. The 
three companions went to a nearby home to get buckets of water, while 
Gomez-Munoz stayed with the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
When the three companions returned to the car they found Gomez-Munoz suffering 
from a gunshot wound to the chest. 
</P>
<P>
The three companions took Gomez-Munoz to a nearby health clinic, where he died 
before emergency personnel could take him to a hospital, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by deputies and interviews with the victim's companions led 
authorities to Miller's home, 27067 Highway 78 East. GENE YASUDA

REFLECTIONS: 'I ASSUMED FLYING WAS ONLY FOR WEALTHY AND MALES. I THOUGHT THERE 
WAS NO HOPE FOR ME.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Linda Ann Goodrich walks briskly across the tarmac at Montgomery Field, 
black notebook in hand, airplane owners nervously look up and wonder if she's 
coming for them. The 38-year-old woman doesn't look like an inspector for the 
Federal Aviation Administration. Neither does she look like an opera singer. 
But she is both, and that's the message that Goodrich tries to impart to the 
little girls at the schools where she gives speeches: You can be anything you 
want to be. Times reporter Leslie Wolf interviewed Goodrich at Montgomery 
Field, and Dave Gatley photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
I once heard someone say there was a distinct relationship between music and 
aviation, and I think it's true. When I'm singing, I feel like I'm free, just 
releasing joy, expressing myself. When I'm flying, I feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
I've been singing since I was 8 or 9 years old. I developed a taste for opera 
and the old songs of the '40s. If you looked in my high-school yearbook it 
would say, "plans to be an opera singer" under my name. I practiced for hours 
each day and did some work at the Starlight opera. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, I would get the feeling I needed to go someplace to take a break, 
and I always ended up at the airport watching airplanes. It was before the 
fences were put in here at Montgomery Field, and I could sit on the ridge with 
my lunch and watch the planes taxi by. I even picked up a cheapie radio at 
Radio Shack so I could tune in to the frequencies and listen to the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Watching the pilots, I made the assumption flying was only for wealthy people, 
and males only. I thought there was no hope for me. 
</P>
<P>
But one day in July of 1975, just for the fun of it, I decided to look in the 
paper and, to my amazement, there was a little teeny plane for sale for $7,500. 
That was just what my car cost. So I sold my car and bought the plane. 
</P>
<P>
I'd never even been in an airplane before. Everybody thought I was nuts, but it 
was just something I had to do. I'd never seen any females in planes, so there 
was a certain challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was in Oceanside, and I found someone there to give me lessons. I 
figured having a plane was like having a car -- you have to know something 
about how it works or you could die. I started working as a mechanic's helper 
so I could learn about planes. On Dec. 24, I got my pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
Then I met and married my husband, who worked at University Mechanical with me. 
We did a lot of flying together. The following year, I quit University 
Mechanical and went to work at Palomar Radio selling two-way radios. I also 
worked selling water beds for a while. All the while I was still spending hours 
on voice lessons because I wanted to make a profession out of singing. But it 
was very difficult breaking into the opera business, it's very political. I was 
very unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, my husband was transfered to Saudi Arabia and we lived there for two 
years. I managed a hotel over there for a Saudi prince. Ironically, British 
mercenary pilots for the Saudis stayed at my hotel. It was very interesting 
working around those people, hearing their tales. But my singing was suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the States, my husband was given the opportunity to work in San 
Francisco, so we went there. I tried out for the Metropolitan Opera there and 
made it. It was like a dream come true! 
</P>
<P>
I went home and told my husband about it, and he said, "What about your 
flying?" I had recently enrolled to get my airplane maintenance license, and I 
decided that, because everything was falling into place, aviation was where I 
was supposed to go. The opera director was amazed when I told him. He thought I 
was nuts for turning him down. 
</P>
<P>
Around that time, my husband started getting ill. We came back to San Diego and 
found out he had lung cancer. I continued on with school at Miramar College, 
and at each break in school I'd run home to see how he was doing. The teachers 
worked with me wonderfully and let me do a lot of studying outside of class. 
</P>
<P>
My husband passed away that June. I continued with my classes and finally 
graduated the following June, with honors and with a scholarship to National 
University. While I was earning my bachelor's degree there, I started my own 
company, called Lindaero Services. I flew executives in and out of small 
airports, and that's how I supported myself through college. 
</P>
<P>
I've been working for the FAA now for three years. My job is making sure the 
planes are safe. 
</P>
<P>
Through this job, I've tried to give back all the things I've been given. I go 
around to schools and give talks on drug abuse. "You can't fly high" is our 
message. I talk about how you, too, can be in aviation or do anything you want 
to do. I tell the kids they can be anything they want, and that's really been 
my philosophy throughout life. You can realize any dream if you really want it.

2 KILLED IN SAN YSIDRO TRUCK CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two passengers riding in a panel truck were killed in San Ysidro on Saturday 
when they struck a vehicle leaving a highway off-ramp and then crashed into a 
parked semitrailer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims, who died at the scene, were identified as Marcos Antonio 
Garcia, 25, and Jose Louis Gonzales, 23, both of San Ysidro, said Deputy 
Coroner Robert Engel. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the panel truck was southbound at a high rate of 
speed on Smythe Avenue about 1:30 a.m. when it struck the vehicle coming off an 
Interstate 905 ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The panel-truck driver apparently lost control and crashed into the trailer 
parked in the 2100 block of Smythe Avenue.

SASQUATCH PUTS WILLOW CREEK ON MAP; 
</P>
<P>
THE BIGFOOT BURGER AND OTHER DELIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
WILLOW CREEK, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If not for the legend of a smelly 8-foot tall human-like beast, little would 
set this Northern California town apart from thousands of other American 
hamlets. 
</P>
<P>
Often called the "Bigfoot Capital of the World," Willow Creek straddles 
California 299 about 50 miles from the Pacific Ocean amid lush groves of cedar, 
fir, pine and oak. 
</P>
<P>
More than four dozen of Willow Creek's 800 residents claim to have seen the 
reclusive man-ape, and a thriving industry has been built around the mystique 
of "Bigfoot," or "Sasquatch," as the Indians called the creature that leaves 
16-inch footprints. 
</P>
<P>
Willow Creek businessmen name their shops after the elusive creature and sell 
maps of sightings to tourists eager to clamber around in search of the beast. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can shop at Willow Creek's Bigfoot Lumber &amp; Hardware, search for 
clothes at Sasquatch Second Hand, examine antiques at the Bigfoot Curio Shop, 
enjoy a round of golf at Bigfoot Country Club and cap off the afternoon with a 
Bigfoot Burger. 
</P>
<P>
As summer approaches, Willow Creek softball enthusiasts will organize 
tournaments and fire up barbecues for another round of Bigfoot Days. 
</P>
<P>
Local beauties will preen, primp and sell raffle tickets. 
</P>
<P>
She who sells the most tickets by the end of the season will be crowned Bigfoot 
Queen under the watchful eye of a huge Bigfoot statue in Bigfoot Square during 
a four-day celebration over Labor Day Weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely helped the area," said Terri Castner, president of the local 
Chamber of Commerce. "The legend has been fantastic for our town." 
</P>
<P>
The chamber's tourist information booth sits a convenient two or three "Bigfoot 
steps" behind a massive redwood Bigfoot statue. 
</P>
<P>
The legend has been part of Northern California Indian lore for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
When a road-building crew in 1958 discovered 17-inch tracks, heavy 55-gallon 
metal barrels tossed about like toys, a 700-pound tire thrown over a cliff and 
large human-like droppings, Bigfoot entered the 20th Century here. 
</P>
<P>
A story appeared in the local newspaper, wire services picked it up and Willow 
Creek found itself basking in Bigfoot glory. But an expedition by a New York 
zoologist and several magazine investigations failed to find concrete evidence 
of the creature. 
</P>
<P>
According to legend and unsubstantiated modern sightings, the man-apes have 
slanted foreheads, broad nostrils, coarse body hair, a shrill scream and a 
putrid smell. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, variety store owner Al Hodgson took plastic impressions of 
large tracks he found in a creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is that the tracks were actually there. I couldn't tell if they 
were fake or not," he said. "One would think that by this time, there'd be some 
solid proof. A bone, a body, something." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of hard evidence, sightings of the creature and his tracks 
keep pouring in, along with tourist dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people come up here just because of Bigfoot. We're known as the 
gateway to Bigfoot country. They're very interested in the statue and looking 
for Bigfoot in the woods," Castner said.

OUSTED LAWNDALE OFFICIALS VOW TO CONTINUE INQUIRY ON CITY USE OF $8-MILLION 
GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ousted from their appointed positions for questioning the handling of a federal 
grant, two Lawndale civic activists vowed to redouble their investigations into 
possible wrongdoing at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Larry Rudolph, Dan McKenzie and Harold E. Hofmann voted last week to 
remove Recreation Commissioner Nancy Marthens and Beautification Committee 
Chairman Virginia Rhodes from their advisory posts after the two wrote to the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleging that the city 
mishandled an $8-million federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry by Marthens and Rhodes "was not in the city's best interest," 
Rudolph said in an emotional call for the removal of Marthens, whom he 
appointed to the commission last year. 
</P>
<P>
McKenzie, who appointed Rhodes, said: "I don't think they (Rhodes and Marthens) 
are working for the city's interests anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Marthens and Rhodes said they believe their vigilance is needed. Rhodes accused 
city officials of "inefficiency, waste, neglect and incompetency." 
</P>
<P>
They added to the controversy Thursday night by publicly distributing copies of 
a billing statement from City Atty. David J. Aleshire's law firm, Rutan &amp; 
Tucker. One of the charges listed was for "laundering of funds" in conjunction 
with the federal grant. 
</P>
<P>
Visibly upset, Aleshire said laundering was an erroneous and "unfortunate" word 
used by an assistant attorney in the firm. He said the charge was for an 
analysis of how city officials can determine when grant funds restricted to a 
specific use become available for general purposes. He said Marthens' failure 
to ask him for an explanation first was "another example of political 
grandstanding as opposed to openness and honesty." 
</P>
<P>
Marthens said she does not believe Aleshire's explanation and she plans to 
submit to HUD the bill with the "laundering" entry. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens and Rhodes said they were outraged by their removal from the city 
posts and view it as an abrogation of their constitutional right to free 
speech. "You are making it a crime in Lawndale to seek the truth," Marthens 
told the council. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Marthens and Rhodes said they will keep pressing for answers to 
their questions on Lawndale's administration of the $8-million federal grant 
that the city obtained in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Under a complex agreement, the city lent the $8 million to South Bay 
Associates, a subsidiary of Forest City Enterprises, the developer of the 
$70-million Galleria at South Bay. In addition to repayment of the loan with 6% 
interest -- which provides the city with an income of nearly $48,000 a month -- 
the city eventually is to receive a share of mall proceeds once the developer 
reaches a certain level of profits. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens and Rhodes say that the city failed to meet hiring objectives for the 
employment of Lawndale residents at the mall; that the city failed to seek HUD 
approval for a mall refinancing approved by the council last year, and that the 
city has failed to comply with a provision of the original deal that for 10 
years prevents the developer from buying out the city's interest in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire and members of the City Council have defended the city's handling of 
the grant funds and said the loan is one of the best investments the city has 
ever made. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse said the voluminous document Marthens and Rhodes submitted 
to HUD is "full of lies and unfounded allegations." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Lawndale residents got jobs at the mall, Kruse and McKenzie said, 
adding that they personally helped run a special job recruitment program when 
the mall opened in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Aleshire said the city did not need HUD approval for the refinancing because it 
did not increase the outstanding debt. He said that because HUD has signed off 
on the project, the federal agency is no longer a party to the contract and the 
10-year restriction can be waived by the remaining parties -- the city and the 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
HUD has asked the city to respond to the inquiry, but has made no comment on 
the substance of the allegations. A HUD official in Washington said that the 
federal agency has reviewed the city's procedures and issued a certificate of 
completion on the project, which normally ends the agency's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens' and Rhodes' inquiry comes at a sensitive juncture as the city winds 
up months-long negotiations on a proposal by the developer to cash out the 
city's interest in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the cash could be a windfall for the city, but Rhodes and 
Marthens oppose the plan because they believe the city might squander a lump 
sum. In their letter to HUD, they pointed out numerous management problems that 
have plagued City Hall, including the loss of $1.68 million in a speculative 
securities investment in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move, Kruse and Norman abstained from voting on the removal of 
Marthens and Rhodes. In interviews last week they were highly critical of 
Marthens and Rhodes and said they would support their removal. 
</P>
<P>
But after Thursday's vote, they said they abstained to protest a method of 
commission appointments adopted last year by the council majority, a method 
they say is illegal. Formerly the mayor made all appointments with the approval 
of the council. Now each council member makes an appointment to each city 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
Marthens and Rhodes did not mention that issue in interviews last week. 
Political observers said that by abstaining, Kruse and Norman may have hoped to 
pin responsibility for the removal of the two outspoken activists on the 
council majority, with whom they are often at odds. "They're the ones 
accountable," Kruse said. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse and Norman said in an interview that their abstentions do not mean they 
are backing away from earlier comments that they, like the council majority, 
are displeased with Marthens and Rhodes over the HUD inquiry. They said they 
view the inquiry as conflicting with the responsibilities of city 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't play two roles at the same time," Kruse said.

MAYOR CANDIDATE PLEDGES TO PUT REIN ON HARBOR GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilman Nate Holden -- attempting to woo voters in a district 
where people blame the Port of Los Angeles for pollution, traffic and unsightly 
junkyards -- told a group of Wilmington residents Thursday night that if he is 
elected mayor, he will curb the growth of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I pledge to you that this program they have in place (to further expand the 
port) will end," Holden declared. "Your problems will be reduced -- if I have 
to close down the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
He also promised that if elected mayor this spring -- the primary is in April 
with a runoff, if necessary, in June -- to appoint new harbor commissioners 
who, he said, would be more responsive to residents' concerns. When one man 
said he felt the community had been making progress with the current harbor 
commissioners, Holden replied: "Don't be fooled or used. Your problems are not 
being dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
In his wide-ranging talk before the Wilmington Home Owners, Holden also pledged 
to beat the city's gang and drug problems. He offered few specifics, however, 
except to say that he wanted to steer youths into a program similar to that of 
the California Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"We're gonna break these gangs up," he declared. "Well you say, how are you 
gonna do that? I pledge to do that and it will be done. . . . I want you to 
know that we're going to clean up this crime. Trust 
</P>
<P>
me . . . . If need be, I'll put a black-and-white in front of every rock 
cocaine house. That's what I'll do." 
</P>
<P>
The one-time state senator and former aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Kenneth Hahn painted himself as a candidate of the people, an outsider in Los 
Angeles city government but an insider at the county, state and federal levels. 
He was elected to the City Council in June, 1987, defeating Homer Broome Jr., a 
candidate backed by Bradley for the 10th District seat. 
</P>
<P>
While saying he was "not a member of the club" -- meaning the insiders on the 
City Council -- Holden peppered his talk with anecdotes about his chats with 
other public officials, including Hahn, Gov. George Deukmejian and even former 
President Gerald Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"You want someone who is committed," Holden told the 100 or so residents at the 
meeting. "When I want something done at the local level, I get it done because 
I can talk to the governor. The mayor can't -- and won't." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners had invited Holden to their meeting, just as they invited 
Bradley last month. Next month, the group hopes to host the remaining candidate 
in the three-man race, Baxter Ward, a former Los Angeles County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
The group gave Holden a generally warm reception, although at least one 
community leader said she was disappointed that he did not offer more concrete 
solutions to the harbor area's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel tonight that they (those problems) weren't really addressed fully," 
said Simie Seaman, whose group, the Banning Park Neighborhood Assn., had sent 
Holden a four-page typewritten list of questions. "I wasn't comfortable with 
the way they were addressed." 
</P>
<P>
But others seemed hopeful about Holden, who is considered a long shot against 
Bradley. "He presented like he has a lot of power," said Joe Mendez, who asked 
the councilman if he would consider pushing the refineries to help clean up 
Wilmington. "Whether he had that power or not, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilmington Home Owners President Peter Mendoza: "I like him. I agree with 
him. It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Holden hammered away at the theme of change throughout his talk, often 
challenging the residents -- like a preacher -- to shout out the word. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we want change?" he yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"YES!" the residents replied. 
</P>
<P>
"Then that's what we'll have."

ELDER PAYS $1,000 FOR POSSIBLE STAFF MISUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Dave Elder (D-Long Beach) paid the state $1,000 from his campaign 
treasury last December to cover the possibility that legislative phones or 
staff were used for political purposes instead of legislative business. 
</P>
<P>
The deliberate use of state offices, equipment, and staff for campaign purposes 
is illegal in California. 
</P>
<P>
A notation in Elder's most recent campaign finance statement filed at the end 
of January said the $1,000 was "payment to the State of California for any 
expenditures that may have been made by omission or by error." 
</P>
<P>
The amount is five times greater than the $200 that Elder paid to the state for 
the same purpose in both 1986 and 1987, according to campaign records. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly Rules Committee, 
which receives the payments, said quite a few legislators make payments to the 
state for "the inadvertent use of legislative facilities" for campaign 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly would not discuss specifics about other lawmakers' payments to the 
state, but said most of the checks are between $500 and $1,000 -- "$1,000 would 
be high." 
</P>
<P>
Elder said in an interview last week that he tries to keep his campaign 
activities "absolutely separate from the business of being a legislator." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Unusual Year 
</P>
<P>
But the veteran lawmaker said he spent more time on legislative campaigns last 
year than at any point since he was elected to the Assembly in 1978. He was 
overwhelmingly reelected last November in the solidly Democratic 57th Assembly 
District, which includes San Pedro, Wilmington, Harbor City and much of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Elder said 1988 was "an unusual campaign year" because he managed his own 
reelection effort and assisted in four other Assembly campaigns at the request 
of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried to separate the campaign stuff. I do everything I can to make sure 
I don't have a problem," Elder said. "If we made a mistake, I'd like it 
covered." 
</P>
<P>
Elder said the $1,000 payment was made to take care of that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The six-term lawmaker said he is not aware of his staff doing campaign work. 
"I'm not there all the time," he said. "I don't think anything political 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
However, Elder said that he does make and receive phone calls at his state 
office where the conversation sometimes turns from legislation to a discussion 
of campaigns or fund-raising events. "You'll start out making a call about a 
bill and end up talking about an event," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another example of how state money can be spent for political purposes, Elder 
said, is when his state-paid secretary schedules a meeting for him with a 
campaign consultant and uses a state phone to call and reconfirm the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
He said only "a minimal amount of (state) money" is involved. 
</P>
<P>
Elder said Brown recommended that all Assembly Democrats pay $1,000 to the 
state from surplus campaign funds to cover any improper expenditures or use of 
state offices or staff. 
</P>
<P>
The money is deposited in a contingency fund used to pay for Assembly 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Elder recalled Brown telling members of the Democratic caucus: "The way you 
solve the problem is send in a check." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good way to handle it," said Elder. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that state Controller Gray Davis, a former Assemblyman, had made 
similar payments to the state while in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Davis agreed in a civil settlement last October to pay the state $28,000 for 
improper use of legislative employees, telephones, offices and computer time on 
his controller's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Payment 'Pretty Extraordinary' 
</P>
<P>
Connelly said Davis' payment was "pretty extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp found that at least seven of 
Davis' legislative employees improperly worked on his 1986 election campaign on 
state time, using state facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp concluded there was "insufficient evidence to justify the filing of 
criminal charges" against Davis because he could not prove that Davis knew his 
staff performed campaign work on state time. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office is investigating allegations that a South Bay 
legislator, Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) had a Capitol secretary type her 
doctoral dissertation on a state computer on state time. That inquiry is 
continuing, according to Assistant Atty. Gen. Eugene Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Elder's alleged use of state-paid staff members to perform personal chores 
during work hours became an issue in his 1982 reelection campaign. At the time, 
Elder denied reports by former aides who said the assemblyman had required them 
to assist in moving, baby-sitting, doing odd jobs and attempting to untangle 
his family's financial records. 
</P>
<P>
"Those allegations were not true then and they are not true now," Elder said.

<P>
GUIDE WARNS OLDER ADULTS OF HAZARDS IN EXCESS DRUGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Millions of older adults suffer adverse drug reactions each year as a result of 
misprescribed drugs, and many people mistakenly believe drug-related woes are 
just part of old age, a consumer health advocate says. 
</P>
<P>
The advocate, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, has written a new consumer guide aimed at 
changing doctor-patient relations and deflecting the marketing of drugs to 
doctors for the elderly, who make up a big share of the drug-consuming market. 
</P>
<P>
"The drug industry is aware of the fact that for millennia, the doctor-patient 
relationship is one in which the doctor has the upper hand," Wolfe said 
recently, adding that 9 million adults over 60 suffer unnecessarily every year 
because of prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
A physician, Wolfe is the outspoken director of the Washington-based Public 
Citizen Health Research Group, which he co-founded with consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader. 
</P>
<P>
"Only recently has the patient said, 'Hey, maybe I'd be getting better care if 
I work with my doctor,' " Wolfe said shortly before the September release of 
the book, "Worst Pills, Best Pills," distributed by Pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
The book's subtitle, "The Older Adult's Guide to Avoiding Drug-induced Death or 
Illness," emphasizes the severity of the problem, which Wolfe considers "an 
epidemic" for those over 60, who in this country number about 40 million. 
</P>
<P>
The book lists the 287 most prescribed drugs and their possible good and bad 
effects for Americans over 60. Included are 104 drugs the book said should not 
be used at all and 183 safer alternatives, some of which do not involve taking 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Although older adults do have more chronic diseases than those who are younger 
. . . there is mounting evidence that many of our older citizens are getting 
prescription drugs which are entirely unnecessary . . . " or could be used at a 
lower dose or in a safer form, the book says. 
</P>
<P>
Over-drugging of the elderly is commonplace, other geriatric health experts 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I make my living basically is by taking people off of drugs," said Dr. 
William Burke, director of geriatric psychiatry at the University of Nebraska 
in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed with the book's warnings about the widespread use of addictive drugs 
called benzodiazepines -- so-called minor tranquilizers like Valium, Librium, 
Xanax -- in addition to sleeping pills like Halcion. 
</P>
<P>
Heart and blood pressure medications and gastrointestinal drugs also are 
over-prescribed, the book concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Even before seeing the book, the American Assn. of Retired Persons in 
Washington welcomes Wolfe's contribution, said Judith Brown, a health analyst 
for the group. 
</P>
<P>
She said AARP has been disappointed by the failure of the Food and Drug 
Administration, which licenses all drugs and controls their labeling, to make 
more drug information available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfe's book offers the kind of understandable information that was to have 
been required in the packaging of all prescription drugs, but the FDA dropped 
the proposal at the conclusion of the Jimmy Carter Administration.

PARK DEL AMO NOT SO BAD COMPARED TO SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest opinions regarding the Park Del Amo development (Times, 
Feb. 12). It truly appears that the concern for the Madrona Marsh distracted 
city officials from the density issue. 
</P>
<P>
As a new resident of Torrance who moved from Orange County to be near my job, I 
can tell you that while the project is far too dense, it is hardly ugly when 
compared to the rest of Torrance. My short drive to work takes me past the 
picturesque Mobil refinery, countless post-war cracker-box tract houses, a 
seedy-looking trailer park, bland office parks, oil wells, mini-malls -- an 
architectural smorgasbord compared to other communities I have known. 
</P>
<P>
The industrial facility right outside Summerwind's front gates is an eyesore 
and the city-owned warehouses next to Wilson Park are a disgrace. What about 
the abandoned, burned-out building across from Fire Department headquarters? 
Torrance is convenient, well-run, prosperous and I'm happy to call it home. But 
beautiful it's not. 
</P>
<P>
I purchased in Park Del Amo because the alternative was an overpriced 
1,000-square-foot 45-year-old tract house with one bathroom and half a garage. 
Though dense and architecturally indistinct, Park Del Amo provides up-to-date 
housing with a manicured, unified appearance. Some of the adjacent property 
should look so good. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that longtime residents who purchased spacious Hollywood Riviera homes 
for five figures miss the sight of farmers tilling these fields. I would, too. 
But the remaining marsh can hardly be described as an "oasis" with its trash, 
rusty fence, drainage sump and ugly cinder-block building. I can hardly believe 
all the fuss. Too bad city officials didn't see this coming. They could have 
made something really nice out of all this.

HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP COULD BE REAL TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is preposterous to suppose that allowing students to form chapters of 
Amnesty International on the campuses of Dana Hills and Capistrano Valley high 
schools somehow would violate the constitutional requirements of separation of 
church and state. 
</P>
<P>
So is the contention that the work of Amnesty International does not fit the 
high school curriculum. And also that the organization is political. But those 
are some of the misguided concerns to which officials in the Capistrano Unified 
School District have alluded in their refusal to allow students to form Amnesty 
International chapters on those campuses. 
</P>
<P>
School officials of more than 1,000 other public schools, across the country -- 
including seven here in Orange County -- do not harbor such misconceptions. 
They have welcomed Amnesty International chapters on their campuses. Those 
school officials correctly recognize that the organization is not religious, 
political or partisan. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, is a 
humanitarian group dedicated to the preservation and protection of human 
rights. It has a worldwide membership of about 700,000 in 60 countries. Its 
only weapons in its war against torture, government executions and the 
imprisonment and mistreatment of prisoners of conscience are protest 
letter-writing campaigns and its ability to spotlight public opinion on human 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
We can think of nothing more suited to academics. As Chris Bergerud, a senior 
at Dana Hills High School and Natalie Pierce, a senior at Capistrano Valley 
High School, both of whom have been attempting to gain their principals' 
approval for campus chapters, point out, the California Board of Education 
requires human rights education. So it seems ludicrous that educators would not 
be eager to help students become active in an educational and informational 
program that is tied to the reality of human rights in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Bergerud and Pierce, having been rejected by their principals, are taking their 
case to the school board March 6. Board trustees should follow the example set 
by the Los Angeles school board last October when it granted an appeal filed by 
a senior from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, reversing a decision that 
rejected her request to form an Amnesty International club on campus. No less 
is needed now in the Capistrano district. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching human rights in class from a textbook is fine. But it is far better 
for students -- and for people suffering the loss of their basic rights -- to 
have that knowledge put to practical use through extracurricular humane 
efforts. An on-campus chapter of Amnesty International would be just such an 
effort.

KEEPING THE GREEN IN AN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Green! Green! Green! Boy, do I love Southern California when it's green! 
</P>
<P>
I looked up at our downtown hills and they're green! Driving out Laguna Canyon 
Road: Green! Village parks and lush neighborhood gardens: All green! The recent 
rains may cause havoc on our highways, but the riot of green they add to open 
space is a remarkable, beautiful sight. 
</P>
<P>
I more fully appreciate the word greenbelt, and I'm delighted to read that 
Laguna Greenbelt Inc. is the recipient of the 1989 David Gaines Award for 
"sustained and effective action in defense of the environment," awarded by 
California's oldest environmental lobbying group, the Planning and Conservation 
League. 
</P>
<P>
As the Laguna Greenbelt celebrates its 20th anniversary, the award is an honor 
well-deserved. Congratulations to them and good luck in the continued fight to 
keep Orange County green!

MONORAIL PROJECT AND TRANSIT DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the "unnamed (OCTD) official" cited in the McDonnell Douglas Realty monorail 
column (Orange County section, Feb. 5), I'd like to comment on several of Bob 
Young's remarks and clarify the OCTD staff position on a number of issues 
raised relative to his project. 
</P>
<P>
First, and perhaps foremost, the Orange County Transit District is 
wholeheartedly in support of McDonnell Douglas' efforts to develop the airport 
monorail project. Anything that will remove cars from the area's congested 
streets is a welcome part of the office-building projects and airport expansion 
being planned and constructed. 
</P>
<P>
What concerns us, however, is the expectation that a project such as the one 
McDonnell Douglas Realty is planning would have a significant impact on Orange 
County's commuter traffic problem. The hundreds of workers in the Douglas Plaza 
area will still need their cars to get to and from the office each day. To help 
deal with this problem of improving peak-hour access for commuters, OCTD is 
working closely with the employers in the Irvine Business Center to establish a 
Transportation Management Assn. that will allow us to better develop customized 
transportation services for workers in that area, as we are now doing in the 
South Coast Metro area. This will include car-pooling and van-pooling, 
telecommuting, flexible work hours, special commuter buses and employer 
incentive programs. To truly improve traffic in the airport area, daily 
commuters need attractive alternatives to driving alone. 
</P>
<P>
With respect to the issue of monorail technology, the airport monorail system, 
with its limited speed and capacity, is an ideal local circulation people 
mover. As a regional system, however, it would require substantially higher 
capacity and speeds. A much larger Mark IV monorail vehicle, currently being 
developed for Disney World, or one of the Japanese monorail systems are 
potential technologies for a regional system. 
</P>
<P>
I would also like to note that it is my understanding that the enlarged airport 
facilities will include access provisions for airport-related bus service. 
These services will be provided, as they are now, by private buses, vans and 
taxis operating between the terminal and nearby hotels, rental car agencies and 
parking areas. These buses are better equipped to handle the particular needs 
of the airline passenger than are public transit buses. OCTD, with its bus 
system designed to meet the basic needs of the daily user and commuter, has 
never felt the need to duplicate services better provided by the private sector 
at no cost to taxpayers.

ABORTION DILEMMA: WHICH WAY SHOULD AMERICA GO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In my early marriage I had two miscarriages. In the first, at the first sign of 
something wrong, my doctor rushed me to the hospital for a D &amp; C (dilation 
and curettage), and afterward I never questioned him further. 
</P>
<P>
The second time, at the first spotting, my doctor instructed me to go to bed, 
raise the foot of the bed and stay there until the danger passed. 
</P>
<P>
One night I had a bearing-down urge. I aborted my 3-month fetus. 
</P>
<P>
I have read in your columns so many erroneous concepts of fetuses that I felt 
this letter was overdue. 
</P>
<P>
My 3-month-old fetus was very definitely a baby, with a large head and not 
fully formed fingers and toes. It was unmistakably a male child. 
</P>
<P>
When I finally had a successful pregnancy, between 4 and 4 1/2 months I could 
feel the movement of my baby, and the doctor could hear his heartbeat. Within 2 
weeks he was definitely kicking, and we could watch my stomach and follow his 
head as he turned over within me. 
</P>
<P>
So, how does one decide when it becomes murder to kill this baby?

ABORTION DILEMMA: WHICH WAY SHOULD AMERICA GO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to "All Sides Brace for Abortion Confrontation" (Feb. 6). 
</P>
<P>
My difficulty is with the way the pro-life and pro-choice groups are defined. 
Some pro-choice people were "trained activists." The pro-life people were 
"fundamentalists." Since the people who are against legalized abortion prefer 
the title "pro-life," it is a professional courtesy to call them pro-life, 
especially since the writer used the preferred title of the other side. I don't 
think The Times is stupid, and I know you don't ad-lib the reporting. I am 
forced to conclude that the wording was decreed. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, there are some well-trained "Christian activists" in Operation 
Rescue and elsewhere. The pro-life movement simply urges people to be more 
responsible and less selfish. I'm sure The Times will agree that merely because 
a position isn't popular does not mean that pro-life folks should be treated as 
some sort of Bible-thumping, wild-eyed fanatics out of touch with the 
mainstream. Real "Christian activists" never have been. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, most pro-lifers are Christians, and it's a great compliment to the church. 
I'm proud to be a part of it. Christians and pro-lifers only ask, and deserve, 
the same respect that was given the hippies, Jews, blacks, feminists, 
homosexuals and everybody else. Indeed, if any paper were to print something 
undesirable toward almost any of those groups, somebody would be on the street 
as fast as Al Campanis and Jimmy the Greek.

ABORTION DILEMMA: WHICH WAY SHOULD AMERICA GO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ongoing debate between pro-choice and pro-life advocates has prompted me to 
go public. I am pro-choice. I staunchly support Roe vs. Wade because I do not 
want to see this country move backward, subjecting women again to the mental 
and physical dangers of the back-alley experience. It would be inhuman and 
inhumane -- women have died because of back-alley fishhook and wire hanger 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
I know firsthand what that's like. As a naive and frightened teen-ager who, in 
1966, became pregnant by one mistake (and not my mistake alone), I was going to 
be sent away from my family. I didn't get into this trouble by myself, but here 
I was, going through banishment and punishment alone -- and the nightmare had 
only just begun. 
</P>
<P>
Along came a prince who told me that he would take care of me and my baby. 
After we were married, however, the prince decided he couldn't live with the 
pregnancy, so he took me to Mexico where we lost $400 buying "abortion 
medicine" that turned out to be just estrogen. He then located, through 
underground contacts, a person who would find someone to help. We drove to a 
prearranged meeting place in Los Angeles and met this man who would not allow 
my husband to come along. 
</P>
<P>
In the dead of night, this stranger drove me to a house in the slums, told me 
to walk alone up to the door and knock, cash in hand. The lady of the house led 
me into a dirty back room, where she told me to lie on the floor, naked from 
the waist down, on a blood-stained bed sheet. She placed a hollow, red rubber 
tube onto a straightened-out wire hanger and inserted it, without the benefit 
of painkillers or sterilization techniques, into my uterus. 
</P>
<P>
The wire hanger was then pulled out, leaving the hollow tube inside. The tube 
remained in my body for several days, allowing air to enter from the end 
outside of my body and up into my uterus. 
</P>
<P>
Alone I endured the excruciating contraction pains, speaking only on the 
telephone with a nurse who told me to dig the fetus sack out of the toilet and 
bring it into the hospital. After everything I had already been through, I was 
then segregated and ignored by the hospital staff, who knew that I had broken 
the law and had an illegal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after my ordeal, I heard that the lady who helped me was arrested 
because another young woman wasn't as fortunate as I and had become seriously 
infected. Her family pressed charges. 
</P>
<P>
I no longer have to worry about becoming pregnant, and if Roe vs. Wade is 
reversed it will not affect me personally. However, reversing Roe vs. Wade will 
force other women to experience similar mental and physical abuse that can maim 
and kill them. We won't go back. We can't go back -- that would be unfair, 
dangerous and force women (especially those who cannot afford -- financially 
and/or emotionally -- to support a child and raise it to become a solid 
citizen) to become lawbreakers. Roe vs. Wade must be left standing, please!

FOLLOWERS SOUGHT FOR A NEW 'REVOLUTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our country has gone through a lot of different kinds of revolutions in its 
history. I truly believe it is time for us to have another one: an 
environmental revolution! We are losing our beautiful natural resources to the 
land developers, oil companies, industrialists and corrupt politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Our water is polluted by industrial waste, our oceans by oil spills. Our hills 
and canyons are disappearing in alarming numbers to the greedy developers, our 
air is unbreathable much of the time and our elected officials are selling us 
out to the highest bidder. Our wildlife is endangered and so are we human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
We can stop this if we join together. 
</P>
<P>
I have always had great sympathy for the American Indians. Now I can feel 
empathy with them. The sick, helpless, powerless feeling I get when I see giant 
bulldozers and land movers on the prowl must be what the Indians felt like when 
they saw the wagon trains and buffalo hunters approaching. Must such a shameful 
history repeat itself over and over again? 
</P>
<P>
Once our canyons, hills, water and animals are gone, it will be too late to 
save them. The time is now. I urge you to join our environmental revolution 
today. There are many groups already formed and more being formed daily. Please 
get involved. We need you!

ABORTION DILEMMA: WHICH WAY SHOULD AMERICA GO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-abortionists give single mothers and poor people two options: Put your 
unwanted child up for adoption or keep the baby. Many times these babies have 
medical problems or are of mixed parentage, making them impossible to place. 
Many keep the baby even when they do not have the economic means to provide a 
proper environment. Guilt is heaped on the mother to learn to cope. 
</P>
<P>
Single women live a hand-to-mouth existence they will probably never escape 
from due to the low wages most women with limited education receive. Unwanted 
births lead to unwanted children, who often are abused physically and mentally. 
This leads to social ills that fill our hospitals and prisons. This creates 
situations in our educational institutions with which we are ill-equipped to 
cope. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the anti-abortionists after the babies are born and the mothers take 
them home? There is no affordable child care, no affordable housing, no proper 
medical care and no job training that will provide more than a minimum-wage 
job. I wonder how many of the anti-abortionists live at this economic level. I 
ask the anti-abortionist, "When is the last time that you took in a single 
mother with minimum education and no job skills?" 
</P>
<P>
I do not deny anyone their right to believe and to make their view known to any 
who will listen. But no one has the right to perpetuate their views through 
intimidation and physical force. Abortion has always been with us; those with 
money obtain good care at a price and poor people die in dirty back rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Legalized abortion is one method of helping women in need. The time and money 
spent to take away the choice could be better spent in counseling mothers who 
select abortion or adoption and providing care and training for those desiring 
to keep their babies. 
</P>
<P>
The moral issue is a personal one for each to live and die with on their own 
terms with their own god(s). As people, we should support and help in any way 
we can. Judgment is for someone beyond our sphere.

'HIP' BUT SAFE; 
</P>
<P>
ALCOHOL-FREE NIGHTCLUB SHOWS TEENS HOW THEY CAN HAVE GOOD TIME WITHOUT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The line starts forming at 8:15 p.m. There are pale short-haired boys wearing 
baggy pants with white socks, and bright-eyed girls in black leather 
miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
As they reach the front of the line, each submits to a search. Holding their 
arms straight up, the boys are patted down by a security man wearing a two-way 
communications headset, while the girls open their purses for examination. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately inside the door, an electronic message board spits out red letters 
informing the entrants of house rules. "No drugs, no alcohol, no weapons, no 
bangers," the machine says, using a slang word referring to gang members. Then, 
evoking the name of a device traditionally associated with doctors but in 
recent years favored by youthful drug dealers, the machine says, "Oh yeah, I 
almost forgot. No beepers. What are you, a brain surgeon?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Place to Party Hard 
</P>
<P>
It is Saturday night at Jets, Long Beach's only teen-age nightclub and one of a 
handful in Southern California. The club's purpose, according to its owners, is 
twofold: to give youths a place to party hard on Friday and Saturday nights in 
a drug- and alcohol-free environment, and to provide a good living for its two 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
So far, they say, it is succeeding wildly on the first count and just barely on 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd lost three of my friends to drugs before I was 16," said co-owner Craig 
(Jet) Sutter, 25, for whom the club is named. "What we're doing here is showing 
kids that they can have fun without (drugs and alcohol)." 
</P>
<P>
Adds his partner, Karl Kamb, also 25: "There's nothing to do here but dance, 
drink Coke and eat candy. It's as innocent as a Little League snack bar." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the club is the product of a friendship between the two men that dates 
back to when they were not much older than Little Leaguers. Born and raised in 
Malibu, they were fast friends through most of their childhood and adolescent 
years. Later they pursued separate careers -- Kamb into the car business and 
Sutter into a career in nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked as Disc Jockey 
</P>
<P>
For six years Sutter said he worked at a club for young adults in Santa Monica, 
first as a disc jockey and finally as manager. Surrounded by drugs and alcohol, 
he developed a drinking problem himself. And although he was able to eventually 
get the help he needed to curb it, Sutter said, the experience motivated him to 
want to help others. 
</P>
<P>
So two years ago when the club in Santa Monica closed, throwing Sutter out of 
work, he sought out his old friend Kamb and asked him whether he would like to 
go into the teen-age nightclub business. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of kids who are literally destroying their lives," Sutter said. 
"They have absolutely no future." 
</P>
<P>
By providing an environment that is both "hip" and safe, he figured, he could 
not only solve his own unemployment problem, but do his bit to help curb 
teen-age drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Savings in Club 
</P>
<P>
Kamb liked the idea enough to sink $250,000 into it from his savings, a loan 
from his mother and the sale of his house, car and motorcycle. It was with that 
seed money that the pair leased and renovated the 17,200-square-foot building 
in downtown Long Beach that is now Jets. 
</P>
<P>
After opening a year ago, Kamb said, the new club, which operates only on 
Fridays and Saturdays, was attracting about 100 customers a night. Today, he 
said, it averages 500 teen-agers on each of the two nights, still less than 
half capacity. The owners attribute the significant increase to word-of-mouth 
and an ambitious publicity campaign in which Jets deejays preside over 
lunchtime dances at various area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Unified School District officials say they applaud the idea of a 
non-alcoholic nightclub for teen-agers. "I think it's great," said Edward M. 
Eveland, assistant superintendent for secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt last year to sponsor a series of Friday night drug- and alcohol-free 
dances at Wilson High School had to be temporarily curtailed, he said, after 
the appearance of "riffraff from all over the city . . . who were not looking 
for fun but trouble." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he said, the drinking and carousing outside the dance caused 
police to be summoned to avoid a violent confrontation. Since then, according 
to Wilson High officials, the dances have been resumed with tighter security 
that has eliminated the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm behind any kind of activity that is closely supervised and provides a 
place where kids can go for entertainment other than wandering the streets or 
attending (unsupervised) parties," Eveland said, referring to Jets, which is 
supervised by a staff of young adults. "I think we need more of them." 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate its 15- to 21-year-old patrons, the nightclub features two 
separate dance floors, each with its own sound system and deejay. 
</P>
<P>
One caters to lovers of what Kamb calls "top 40s" hits and "ethnic funk" such 
as rap music. The other, equipped with a smoke machine and floor-to-ceiling 
mirrors, is for more bizarre tastes. On Friday nights its deejays play 
something called "ska" -- a reggae beat favored by "mods" whose style, 
according to Kamb, is patterned after the British subculture of the early 
1960s. And on Saturday nights the space is taken over by "death rockers," 80% 
of whom, he says, wear black. "These are the kids that the neighbors look at 
and say, 'My God, it's Satan,' " Kamb explained. "Actually, they are just 
ordinary kids into a certain type of music." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinct Music Styles 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he said, the club will add a third dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Each type of music suits a particular type of kid," Kamb said. "They're very 
picky about what they listen to. (The different groups) are like oil and water; 
they don't mix." 
</P>
<P>
While admission is $7 at the door, he said, a $2 discount is given to members 
of Alcoholics Anonymous and other drug- or alcohol-treatment programs, of which 
the club gets many. And although Jets is finally making a small profit, Kamb 
said, the profit is still too marginal to have made a dent in his $250,000 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my life," said Kamb, who three weeks ago quit his car sales job to 
manage the club full time. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers seem to like the place, despite its many rules, including those 
forbidding clothing such as baseball caps and white T-shirts, articles which 
have become trademarks of certain gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty safe," said Jenna Mitchell, 17, of Long Beach. "We get tired of 
going to the movies all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Said David Cowan, also 17, a Buena Park resident who said he is enrolled in an 
Orange County drug abuse program: "I come here regularly. It keeps me sober." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was overjoyed at the scene on a recent Saturday night, however. 
Allison MacBeth, 18, of Yorba Linda, for instance, said she was disappointed at 
the deejay's choice of music. 
</P>
<P>
"It was advertised as Mean Gothic but really it's New Wave," she complained. 
"We (Mean Gothic lovers) don't have any place to go anymore. It's annoying."

WITH GRAF, IT'S CASE OF BEST GETTING BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY JENKINS, Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steffi Graf is preposterous. The rest of women's tennis can only gape at her 
massive, injurious strokes and accomplishments, one Grand Slam won and another 
already being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
There have been various suggestions as to how to cure her dominance at the 
Virginia Slims of Washington, Carling Bassett Seguso intimating Graf should 
join the men's tour, and a spectator putting forth the notion she should play 
left-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Prayer is always nice. 
</P>
<P>
Or they can wait for those rare occasions when she runs a temperature. She 
rules the game for a 72-3 record last season, seeming impossible to duplicate 
until she opened 1989 with a laughably easy defense of the Australian Open for 
her fifth consecutive Grand Slam title. 
</P>
<P>
"She's alone," CBS analyst Mary Carillo said. "Anybody who might be in her way 
is too nauseous. That's what she's done to them." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, at 19, is getting better. "She's just a kid, she still needs another two 
years," her coach, Pavel Slozil, said. "Then they're going to be in even bigger 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
They are already in a state of emergency. Chris Evert is merely fodder for 
Graf's lethal groundstrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Even Martina Navratilova now seems overwhelmed by the teen-age insurgent. 
Gabriela Sabatini and Pam Shriver have the most recent victories against her -- 
when she was sick. 
</P>
<P>
Evert has said the only thing that can stop her is "boredom." Players are 
laboring in the weight room and on the practice court, trying to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
"She's beating everyone quite badly," said Manuela Maleeva, the third seed who 
at No. 7 is the highest-ranked player other than Graf in the Slims of 
Washington field. "The motivation is, to not to be one of these that loses to 
her so easy. To stay with her a little." 
</P>
<P>
Bassett Seguso, flicked from the sleeve of Graf by 6-0, 6-0 last week, 
predicted: "No one will beat her this year." Natalia Zvereva of the Soviet 
Union, the No. 8 player in the world, is on course to meet Graf in the 
semifinals, but is frank in assessing her chances. "I am not ready to beat 
her," she said. "Every person is not 100 percent, so maybe she has a weakness. 
But I don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
One would think this dearth of threatening opponents would indeed bore Graf. 
But it has not slowed her at all, and that perhaps is the key to this 
phenomenon, that she is one of the most ambitious players to ever play the 
game. "If I didn't have goals, it wouldn't be interesting," she said. "I try to 
please myself." 
</P>
<P>
Both baseliners and serve-and-volleyers have been equally unavailing against a 
rounded game that displays no evident vulnerability. Only the three defeats in 
the last year show it can be done: Sabatini upset her at the Virginia Slims of 
Florida, 2-6, 6-3, 6-1, when Graf suffered from jetlag; and again more 
convincingly at Amelia Island on clay, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Graf protests, "You can always lose, it's always a possibility." But this is 
because she is human. Sabatini's deep, heavy topsin does seem to bother Graf, 
mainly because it forces her 10 feet further from the baseline, and there her 
shots lack some of their usual power. Or a sharp serve-and-volleyer on a good 
day, while Graf has a bad one, will make her vulnerable. Shriver's semifinal 
victory at the Virginia Slims Championships in November was gallant, 6-3, 7-6 
(7-5), but Graf had a head cold. 
</P>
<P>
In searching for a technical weakness in Graf, one can only nitpick. Her 
forehand is not a perfect illustration; she makes contact with the ball 
somewhat late, almost parallel to her body. While it might be preferable to 
meet the ball earlier, her physical strength is such that it doesn't matter, 
and in her case might be an asset because it makes her stroke harder to read. 
</P>
<P>
"Her technique is not textbook," said Barbara Potter, the 12th-ranked player 
who is regarded as a student of the game. "But neither was John McEnroe's serve 
or Bjorn Borg's forehand." 
</P>
<P>
It has often been said that Graf's backhand is a weaker shot, slightly less 
reliable than the forehand. But in the last year she has developed the ability 
to hit either a consistent hard slice or crushing topspin, and now that remark 
evokes gales of laughter from analysts. "Compared to what?" Carillo said. "Her 
forehand? Yeah, it's not her forehand. Because nothing is her forehand." 
</P>
<P>
Mainly opponents must contend with Graf's furious pace. At 5 feet 9 and 132 
pounds, she is among the hardest hitters the game has ever produced; harder 
than Navratilova, some suggest. Only Sabatini, Helena Sukova and Claudia 
Kohde-Kilsch can match her on some strokes, but not consistently. In response 
Sabatini has tried to build up, adding strength to her shoulders. But this 
could limit her flexibility and mobility. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a difference between strength and power," Carillo said. "Sabatini can 
lift a couch. Steffi can throw the couch across the room. That's the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
There is one phase in which the other women players cannot hope to approach 
equality with Graf, and that is her pure instinct for the game. Her movements 
are almost as biomechanically correct, with an anticipation that Potter 
estimates begins as soon as the ball is eight feet from the strings of her 
opponent's racket. 
</P>
<P>
It starts in her quick firing legs, which have not the slightest bit of fat. 
She has an inexhaustible energy level for practice and training, "She's almost 
antsy," Potter said. Partly this comes from a discipline that is found nowhere 
else on the women's tour. She doesn't indulge in nightlife and likes to be in 
her room by 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something special inside her, she's doing it for herself," Slozil 
said. "She needs tennis. Her body needs to run." 
</P>
<P>
It is widely acknowledged that Navratilova is the only player with the physical 
prowess and discipline to defeat Graf consistently. But the former No. 1 player 
in the world has made just one final in the last five Grand Slam events, and 
that was a defeat to Graf, 5-7, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quite apart from Graf's physical attributes, she is beginning to exert an 
intangible mental block on other players. Potter thinks a common mistake her 
opponents make to try to hit shots they can't make, "to search for a game they 
don't have." 
</P>
<P>
There have been extended periods of domination before, by Evert in 1974 when 
she won 55 consecutive matches, and Navratilova in 1984, when she went on a 
74-match streak without a loss, a record that still stands. But while those 
were lengthier reigns than Graf's 46 straight match victories last season, 
consider Graf lost just two sets in sweeping the Australian and French opens, 
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year and the Australian last month.

LAID-BACK JOHNNY MILLER PRESSES FORWARD; 
</P>
<P>
HE DOESN'T GET MAD, HE GETS 66 TO PULL WITHIN FOUR AT TORREY PINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Vince Lombardi created a football dynasty with the Green Bay Packers, he 
was said to espouse the philosophy, "Winning isn't everything. It's the only 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time golfer Johnny Miller practiced what Lombardi preached, but not 
anymore. Having done about all there is to do in 20 years on the PGA Tour, 
Miller figures the time has come to have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that Miller's new attitude at the age of 41 has reduced his 
golf game to rubble. He is only four strokes off the pace in the Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Open after shooting a six-under-par 66 Saturday in the third 
round at Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
But Miller has had enough of agonizing over his game, and why not? Since 
turning pro in 1969, he has won 23 tour tournaments plus the 1976 British Open 
and has earned $2,474,234. He once won eight events in a single year, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
"This has evolved in the last couple of years," said Miller, who was born in 
San Francisco and lives in Napa. "I don't ever get mad except for golf, so 
that's the ultimate test for me. But I'm really enjoying golf again, and 
because of that, I have more inner peace. Winning isn't part of anything for me 
right now. It just doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
Miller compared his situation to that of his younger contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys on the tour are trying to prove something, and I can understand 
that," he said. "But I have nothing more to prove, and I have nothing to lose. 
I'm not worried about being competitive anymore." 
</P>
<P>
He looked very competitive Saturday, finishing with the second-best round of 
the day, behind Greg Twiggs' 64, which moved him into position to make a run 
for his second San Diego victory. Miller won this tournament in 1982, when it 
was called the Wickes-Andy Williams Open. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll admit it's tough not to be competitive and look at the leader board," 
Miller said. "But honestly, it's not that big a deal for me at this point. 
There is too much 'do or die' in sports today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always remember what Nancy Lopez's father told her one time. He said, 
'Play happy,' and that was the most profound statement I've ever heard. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish Mac O'Grady and the other guys who self-destruct on the golf course 
would adopt that attitude. Some of them are so negative that when they make a 
bad shot, they get teed off, and when they hit a good one, they say, 'It's 
about time.' That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Miller noted that most golfers today put too much pressure on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people think you can make yourself win," he said. "You can't do that. You 
have to be comfortable, and making yourself do something is not being 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guys who reach back for a little extra get something good. But most guys 
who reach back also get something -- bogeys. As you get older, you should get 
wiser, but you may not have the wherewithal to get wiser with." 
</P>
<P>
Miller is off to a fairly good start in his 21st pro season, having earned 
$35,059 in the three events he has entered, and his round Saturday was his best 
to date. He had eight birdies, three on the last four holes. 
</P>
<P>
"That was something, because I'm definitely Shakey's Pizza when I'm putting," 
he said. "I'm definitely borderline, right on the edge of falling off hard. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the highlights of my round came on the 16th hole. It's a par three, and 
my tee shot came down on a lady's blanket and landed on her purse. I asked her 
for the money, but she said no. I got a free drop, and it wasn't a hard chip 
shot from there." 
</P>
<P>
Miller has four sons, ranging in age from 18 to 9, and all play golf. 
</P>
<P>
"My oldest boy (John) is doing well at San Jose State," Miller said. "I also 
have high hopes for a couple of the others. It would be a thrill to follow them 
on the tour when I get older." 
</P>
<P>
How much older? 
</P>

"Well, I'll be 42 in April," he said. "I'm looking forward to going on the 
Senior Tour eight years from now. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, it's going to be fun. We play a lot of sports for the wrong 
reasons. We should play for the joy of it, not how many hairs fall out of our 
heads."

FOR NOW, RED SOX ARE TALKING ONLY BASEBALL

WINTER HAVEN, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Boddicker strolled into the clubhouse carrying not a bag of baseballs, but 
a red-and-white polka-dot diaper bag. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Sellers, now a Cincinnati Red, paid a visit to the Boston Red Sox's 
clubhouse, just to say hello. First-base coach Al Bumbry stuck his head out the 
door and, seeing Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan doing the question and answer bit 
with the media, said, "Look at you. You were in the same position the last time 
I saw you. You're still talking." 
</P>
<P>
The difference is that this is spring training -- rather, pre-spring training 
-- not the hustle and bustle of the American League Championship Series. 
Morgan's sessions with the media no longer include questions about Jose Canseco 
and Mark McGwire; instead, Morgan was able to indulge in typical spring 
training happyspeak the other day ("I like our pitching," "We'll hit more home 
runs") and, in case there was someone in the crowd who hasn't heard them, he 
dredged out some of his old minor-league stories. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox's spring training base will got an adrenalin shot Friday when 
pitchers and catchers report, and the place will be hopping this week when the 
rest of the squad straggles in. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, Winter Haven is sleepy, and the controversy is on hold. Roger 
Clemens, the multimillionaire right-hander, has had his contract problem worked 
out. Wade Boggs isn't in camp yet and Penthouse isn't in the stands, so that 
controversy is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has Mike Greenwell, who wants $1.9 million for the next two years, arrived. 
Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd's long-shot quest to make money through arbitration -- he 
will seek $700,000 in his hearing Friday in New York -- is another issue on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
"For now," Morgan said, "we don't have any problems. There are certainly going 
to be some negative things going on down here, but I don't think that, overall, 
it's going to be that bad. We won a division title last year. We're the 
defending champions. And you know what? I think we can win it again. I really 
do." 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, the manager of the Red Sox pulled out a crumpled newspaper 
clipping from his shirt pocket. The clipping was a mangled portion of some 
writer's feature on Oakland Athletics relief ace Dennis Eckersley, and Morgan 
was particularly interested in a quote in which Eckersley sang the praises of 
hard work and determination. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan used this to help answer a question about the kind of camp he would run 
in this, his first spring training as a major-league manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Camp will be run so that the guys will learn something about baseball. We'll 
go over things and we'll keep going over things," Morgan said. "Everyone will 
be working hard, I can tell you that. But that doesn't mean we won't have fun. 
We'll have some fun down here too." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Boyd throws a temper tantrum if he loses his arbitration hearing? Even 
if Greenwell doesn't get his money? Even if Margo Adams' tell-all expose in 
Penthouse does, indeed, tell all? "Like I said, I don't think it will be that 
bad," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
So while the controversies wait, Morgan is able to talk, for now, about nothing 
but baseball. Among his comments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The notion that Rice must have an exceptional spring to remain with the Red 
Sox: "Not true," Morgan said. "He's not on trial. Sometimes spring numbers are 
overrated. Some guy has a great spring, you keep him on the team and you get 
nothing. You vow you'll never make that mistake again, but you always do. Jimmy 
just has to do his work, and he's doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the Red Sox's need for a left-handed starter: "I'd like to have one, but 
if one doesn't come down the pike we'll go with five right-handers. I'd rather 
do that than use a left-hander who can't do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the Red Sox's home run production: "We'll definitely hit more home runs 
this year. We had some guys who didn't hit as many last year as they can, and 
getting (Nick) Esasky is going to help."

NATIONAL TV HITS LOW WITH PREP BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, they give assurances that this modest proposal will honor the value of 
education. They say this plan to put high school games on nationwide cable 
television will not further pervert high school sports. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides promise. 
</P>
<P>
Well, file that with other famous disclaimers, like the check is in the mail 
and, of course, I'll respect you in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
It's an outrage. A perversion of what high school and high school sports are 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Don't think for a moment it will stop where they promise. It never has. 
</P>
<P>
The National Federation of State High School Associations, composed of 51 
member bodies, has been offering itself and has found a buyer in SportsChannel 
America. The deal is still in the formative stage, but it will happen because 
both sides want it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
For a lot of money, SportsChannel America would televise 20 to 25 
game-of-the-week high school events, largely basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The federation says its members are strongly opposed to a national championship 
basketball tournament, but SportsChannel America programmer Mike Lardner, in a 
revealing slip to The New York Times, said a "natural conclusion is a Final 
Four." Of course it is. 
</P>
<P>
To think it can be otherwise is, as NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz put 
it, like trying to put the genie back in the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
What they're talking about borders on child pornography. Making high school 
sports more big-time is directly contrary to putting the student back into the 
student-athlete. The mind reels. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has everything we don't like in college and professional sports," 
said Dr. Sandra Scott, associate director of the New York State association. 
"It knocks the perspective of sports in education out of whack." 
</P>
<P>
Being able to make a jump shot would be that much more important than being 
willing to approach a geometry problem. 
</P>
<P>
Big-time television will create that much more fawning and coddling of the 
athlete, who already has more than his immature ego can handle. School will be 
that much less important for the star who struts his stuff before the whole 
nation. He will know he can have or take what he wants because his basketball 
skill is important to the adults who are supposed to guide his life and help 
him grow. How many parents will be able to tell him he needs to finish his 
English paper Sunday when he scored 20 points on television Friday? How many of 
them will care? 
</P>
<P>
"We are wrong when the same parents who come out to see Johnny play basketball 
don't come to the Parent-Teacher Organization meetings," says Frank "Bishop" 
McDuffie, vice principal and basketball coach at Laurinburg Institute in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"In the small town (and big city) they're so proud of the athlete; he's 
carrying the banner for everyone so everyone is trying to help," said Tom 
Sanders, former associate director for the Center for the Study of Sports in 
Society and now director of player programs in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Of course there are high school games televised already, but they are in 
relative privacy; this is going to the next dimension. 
</P>
<P>
There are no national standards for making grades. Texas has a no-pass, no-play 
law; the New York State association, which does not include New York City 
schools, leaves it to the individual schools. You can already hear the noise if 
the star is going to be ineligible for the TV game because he's in danger of 
failing civics. 
</P>
<P>
The TV people in Woodbury, N.Y., and the federation people in Kansas City say 
TV won't make schedules, but will pick from the existing schedule. Ah, but we 
already have the abomination of USA Today's Top 25. Will it occur to DeMatha of 
Washington and Mater Dei of Los Angeles that they ought to meet next season? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they ought to play at midnight, which would be prime time on the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Think about the coach who thinks he can climb to a big job if his team looks 
good in a TV showcase. What pressures would he pass down? 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be awfully careful," said Richard McGuire, president of the New 
York State High School Athletic Association. "If basketball is incidental to 
the process of education, it's fine. If it becomes the other way around, we 
have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Think of what it would be for a 15-year-old to take two free throws with 10 
seconds remaining, his team behind the top-ranked team by a point, and the 
white light of the camera burning down. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, those USA Today top darlings would have to meet, and is there any 
doubt that Las Vegas would have a line? It would be worth something to some 
people if that 15-year-old taking the free throws missed. 
</P>
<P>
Think how much national playoffs would mean with the likes of Lew Alcindor 
going against the likes of Alonzo Mourning. But Warren Brown, assistant 
director of the federation, says there just won't be national playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He cites the reasons why the members oppose playoffs: overemphasis on high 
school sports; loss of class time; extension of the season, which would prevent 
many athletes from playing a second sport, and the difficulty of choosing a 
representative from a state with champions in several classes. 
</P>
<P>
But then the genie would already be out of the bottle. An Adolescent Final Four 
would be a matter of time.

USOC REPORT BY 'DIPLOMAT' STEINBRENNER'S COMMISSION DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Boss is now The Diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
In one role, George M. Steinbrenner creates controversy by firing managers, 
squabbling with players and leaking news stories to get his New York Yankees on 
the back pages of the city's tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
But in his new role as chief critic of the United States Olympic Committee, 
Steinbrenner has exhibited surprising traits that include a zest for compromise 
and a quest for secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't bully people, and he listens," said Christopher (Tiff) Wood, a 
three-time Olympian in rowing. "He is cooperative, reasonable and, yes, 
diplomatic. He is not the person I have read about all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner and the seven other members of the Overview Committee finally will 
go public with their top-secret report to retool and refocus the USOC. The 
report is scheduled for release today in Portland, Ore., at the close of the 
USOC's three-day, quadrennial meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"This report can be a file 13 or something to be implemented," Steinbrenner 
said in a recent interview. "We'll make recommendations positively. It will be 
a positive, powerful report." 
</P>
<P>
USOC President Robert Helmick said he expects the committee to release a report 
that is firm, fair and objective. 
</P>
<P>
"My purpose with the commission's report will be to implement it immediately," 
said Helmick, who adds he will read the report for the first time this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Many were surprised a year ago when Helmick turned to Steinbrenner for a 
top-to-bottom review of the U.S. Olympic effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The only side of Steinbrenner I've noticed is a very effective business 
person, a dedicated person," said Helmick. "I don't happen to be a baseball 
fan. I don't know this baseball persona. I've only known George through the 
USOC. I've come to rely upon him as an effective member." 
</P>
<P>
The timing of Steinbrenner's committee appointment -- in the midst of the 1988 
Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta -- probably couldn't have been worse. The 
United States won six medals at Calgary and finished a disappointing third 
behind the Soviet Union and East Germany in the medal count at the Summer 
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't worried about the timing," said Steinbrenner, who is expected to be 
elected one of the USOC's three at-large vice presidents this weekend. "I'm a 
champion of causes for athletes." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner, a member of the USOC Executive Board for five years, has handled 
tough assignments before. He helped mediate a dispute between the Amateur 
Athletic Union and The Athletics Congress over use of the term Junior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"George put some people together to hammer out the issues," said Mike Plant, an 
executive board member. "He basically took depositions, and, in two years, an 
agreement was reached. He wears two hats. With the Yankees, he pays the bills 
and does what he pleases. With the USOC, he has been low-key and effective." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner has stepped into a logistical mine field with this commission. 
Officially, Steinbrenner and the other members of the committee -- drawn from 
sports, academics and business -- were asked to evaluate the USOC's performance 
10 years after the federal Amateur Sports Act of 1978. The legislation ended 
years of bickering between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the 
AAU, and chartered the USOC in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, the committee's mandate was clear: Put U.S. athletes back on a 
competitive fast track. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very strongly about the need to keep our program in step with the other 
nations of the world," Steinbrenner said. "The other nations are donating a 
large portion of government finances to their programs. To them, this isn't 
just sports. This is prestige. They're all coming on strong. It's important to 
America, for the national recognition of our nation, to do well at the 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
In an update released last April 27, the committee wrote, "This is not a witch 
hunt, I can assure you." 
</P>
<P>
The committee has engaged in a year of fact-finding and interviewing, 
contacting hundreds of athletes and administrators. But Steinbrenner said the 
committee could not reach all voices of amateur sport. For example, the 
committee interviewed Ollan Cassell, TAC chairman, and Tom Tellez, the 
University of Houston coach who oversees Carl Lewis' training, but failed to 
contact Olympic track and field coaches Stan Huntsman and Terry Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't reach everyone," Steinbrenner said. "If we listened to everyone, 
every view, it would have taken us 10 years to finish this." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a veil of secrecy placed over the contents of the report, many within 
the Olympic movement expect the commission to address at least three major 
areas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Funding for athletes. The USOC had hoped to institute a pay scale for elite 
athletes, but after failing to reach a $50 million target for sale of Olympic 
coins, the program is in limbo. The USOC is expected to approve a $248 million 
budget for the period through the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France, and 
Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The USOC's bloated bureaucracy. This is a two-tiered problem. The USOC is 
an umbrella covering a diverse group of organizations, ranging from Olympic 
sports to the American Bowling Congress to the YMCA. Accounting irregularities 
also have been uncovered at the USOC's headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Creating a system of accountability that rewards the national governing 
bodies that spend money wisely. The USOC filters its money to the bodies -- 
some that achieve results, others that don't. The U.S. volleyball team is 
viewed as a model, maintaining a year-round training center and a job program 
for its players. Sports such as bobsledding and speed skating have been beset 
with internal strife throughout the decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The USOC is a congress of sport," said Helmick. "But we can cut down on the 
bureaucracy. I think there is a lot we can do to make ourselves more efficient. 
We need massive changes in funding to get the type of support the athletes 
need. The budget we're going to present, where we maintain the same level of 
administrative costs and have the increases fall to the athletes, is the 
correct direction." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC is essentially a volunteer organization that has undergone traumatic 
and dramatic growth in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"One major problem we have in this country is there are people at home, 
watching games, who are intimately involved in training and selection of 
athletes," said Mike Jacki, executive director of the U.S. Gymnastics 
Federation. "The rest of the world is doing this as a serious business, and 
we're doing this with volunteers. Some guy is a plumber Monday through Friday, 
and, on weekends, he is making decisions for the USOC." 
</P>
<P>
But for one weekend, at least, the USOC will take direction from a 
controversial baseball owner-turned-judicious administrator. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been one of the truly enlightening things I've ever been involved 
with," Steinbrenner said. "The USOC is the greatest voluntary organization in 
the history of the world. What they've accomplished has been tremendous. These 
people are fanatical. It is uplifting for me to see them work this hard."

CELTICS SHOULD BE PLAYING BETTER THAN .500 TEAM AND THEY KNOW IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER MAY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Celtics were23-23, right in the middle of the proverbial pack at the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
It is exactly where they belong. 
</P>
<P>
They are neither very good nor very bad, though they have shown a greater 
inclination to descend to the latter than ascend to the former. 
</P>
<P>
They are awful on the road (5-15), average at home (18-8), woeful when trying 
to rally (1-17 when not leading after three quarters) and reasonably successful 
protecting fourth-quarter leads (22-6 in games in which they lead after three). 
</P>
<P>
They have been competitive -- 14 of their 23 defeats have been by nine points 
or fewer -- and they are a big improvement over recent Celtics' teams in two 
areas: rebounding and turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
They have not fallen through a dead spot in the parquet floor after Larry Bird 
went down for the four-month count. Neither did they collectively elevate their 
game to prove they could prosper without No. 33. And with four so-called 
All-Stars on the roster, that has to be a disappointment. They should be better 
than 23-23 and they know it. 
</P>
<P>
The season has been one of almost unending adjustment. New Coach Jimmy Rodgers 
has tried to reacquaint the team to the running game. He has had little success 
there. Because of injuries, experiments and other factors, Rodgers has employed 
11 starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
The coach has blended youth into the picture and has shown patience as the 
players learn the ways of the NBA. However, his preseason vow to cut down on 
the minutes of the elder statesmen hasn't been carried out, particularly in the 
case of Robert Parish. 
</P>
<P>
In the preseason preview on the Celtics, we listed six potential trouble areas 
for the team. One of them, an over-reliance on Bird's scoring, is not 
applicable. The other five are as valid now as they were then. 
</P>
<P>
No rest for Robert: This is as compelling an issue now as it was before the 
season. And back then, that's what everyone seemed most concerned about. And 
all Parish has done is defy logic, having arguably his best season and 
averaging 36.8 minutes and playing in all 46 games. Can he keep it up? The 
Chief maintains he can. He came into camp expecting to play many minutes (if 
maintained, the 36.8 mpg would be his second highest). With only Mark Acres as 
a replacement, there seems little doubt Parish will continue to pile up the 
minutes. What has hurt Rodgers' chances to get more rest for Parish has been: 
a) the coach's belief that a victory here or there is worth the sacrifice, and 
b) the lack of blowouts, either way. Unless the Celtics do something about a 
backup, look for Parish's marathon minutes to continue. 
</P>
<P>
Are the kids really all right?: Without question, the biggest disappointment of 
the season is the regression of Brad Lohaus. It's almost to the point now where 
he'd have trouble finding the square hole for the square block. His confidence 
is shattered, the coaching staff wonders if he's an NBA-caliber player and he 
seems uncomfortable in whatever role he is asked to perform. After last season, 
this is indeed a crusher. The Celtics need more, much more from him, but it may 
be they won't get it because he can't give it to them. Reggie Lewis is the flip 
side of Lohaus. He has taken advantage of the opportunities presented to him 
and now represents a legitimate scoring force. His defense is still suspect, 
but he is a diligent worker with an ideal temperament. The one question is what 
happens to him when Bird returns? Brian Shaw tilts much more toward the Lewis 
end than the Lohaus end. Rodgers has done the wise thing and inserted him as a 
starter. And the coach did the wise thing Wednesday and let Shaw finish the 
game; the team isn't so predictable with him out there. One inescapable 
conclusion: Shaw needs time. Right now, most of his minutes are coming out of 
Danny Ainge's pocket rather than Dennis Johnson's. Since being elevated to the 
starting lineup, Shaw has averaged a Fat Lever-esque 10.8 points, 7.8 rebounds 
and six assists and shot 47 percent in games in which he has played at least 30 
minutes. In games in which he has gone less than 30 minutes, he averaged four 
points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.5 assists and shot 32 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Easy baskets: The Celtics haven't exactly embraced the up-tempo game -- "They 
don't like to run," said Indy's Reggie Miller -- which is one reason (along 
with the absence of the creative Bird) that they lead the league in fewest 
turnovers committed. And much of their futility in the fourth quarter is 
because of lack of movement, with or without the ball. But they are getting 
more easy hoops thanks to a vast improvement in offensive rebounding and more 
pressure on defense in selected spots. Boston was last in offensive rebounding 
last season. It is sixth this season. Boston was last in forcing turnovers last 
season. It is 21st this season. The Celtics lead the league in overall 
rebounding and, for the past three years, the top rebounding team has averaged 
49 victories. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Expectations Jinx: This jinx has changed from the pressure on Rodgers 
to the pressure on the team to pull a 180-degree turn when Bird returns. Bird's 
injury has eliminated much of the public pressure. If they were 23-23 with Bird 
healthy, that would be a different story. No one is talking about division 
flags or championships now. But the big mistake many might be making (including 
the front office) is thinking things will automatically turn around when Bird 
returns.

BARREL OF BEER ADS ADD UP TO BIG BUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dick Schultz, the executive director of the NCAA, politely calls it "mixed 
messages." Not so charitably, I would call it "hypocrisy" when drug-education 
spots during NCAA telecasts are followed by beer commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz has emerged as a central figure in raising consciousness about college 
sports' identification with beer huckstering and its effects on youth. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "High school federations and others say that there are three million 
to four million alcoholics under drinking age in this country, that the No. 1 
problem on campuses and in high schools is alcohol abuse. We have to be 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
When Schultz first broached this issue of "mixed messages," he seemed to 
suggest completely eliminating beer commercials from NCAA telecasts. This was 
met with opposition not only by the networks and beer companies, but also by 
school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The beer companies got upset that beer was called an illegal drug," Schultz 
said. "But beer is illegal for those under drinking age, which takes in most 
college students." 
</P>
<P>
The networks are concerned about any threat to sponsorship dollars. But they 
have been shrewd enough not to raise a big public stink about Schultz' threat. 
They merely pointed out a number of facts of life. If Schultz' desire to drop 
beer commercials from NCAA tournament programming meant less revenue for 
telecasters, it would also mean a smaller rights fee for the NCAA, which will 
negotiate its next TV contract in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The realistic fact is, though, that the NCAA basketball tournament is such a 
hot property on television that other well-heeled companies would no doubt rush 
in to fill commercial gaps created by the absence of the beer barons. 
</P>
<P>
The significant objection has been raised by NCAA member schools. Arizona 
Athletic Director Cedric Dempsey, chairman of the Division I men's basketball 
committee, has said a number of athletic directors are opposed to a beer-ad ban 
by the NCAA because it would pressure individual schools to follow suit, wiping 
out beer commercials on regular-season telecasts. It would also raise the 
question of schools taking beer-signage money, beer ads in publications and 
beer sponsorships from coach's TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Schultz sees the beer issue as a question of the hypocritical factor vs. the 
schools' fear that the ban would trickle down revenue they believe they can't 
afford to lose. He appears to recognize the trickle-down factor as a formidable 
obstacle to a beer ban, because he is talking about something less drastic than 
an outright beer ban. 
</P>
<P>
The current NCAA Tournament deal with CBS limits beer advertising to 90 seconds 
per hour. If beer ads are to continue, Schultz said, "I would hope that at a 
minimum, we could limit those announcements to moderation or education-type 
messages about responsible drinking. The industry tells me they spend millions 
on such moderate-drinking messages, and I think that would be more apt on our 
telecasts." 
</P>
<P>
The beer industry has suggested that the proposal may be an infringement of 
free speech. Isn't that a joke? With the Niagara of beer advertising all over 
the tube, just how much of a gag on beer huckstering would an NCAA ban 
represent? 
</P>
<P>
Schultz heads an executive negotiating committee that includes two people from 
Divison I basketball. They will set the guidelines about beer commercials in 
negotiating the next NCAA Tournament rights, not only with CBS, but with NBC 
and ABC, which are also lusting for the NCAA jamboree. 
</P>
<P>
The issue now comes down to the pressure put on the NCAA by citizens concerned 
about drugs -- which includes alcohol, which includes beer -- against the 
inside pressure by big schools that don't want to lose beer-ad revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Schools will lobby quietly and with force inside the NCAA. Citizen groups 
concerned with the alcohol problem on and off campuses and with impressionable 
pre-high schoolers assaulted by beer commercials will have to lay siege to the 
NCAA publicly.

CLAREMONT OVERCOMES KEISTER, OCCIDENTAL TO RECORD 75-70 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference coaches and 
players have become intimately familiar with -- and thoroughly frustrated by -- 
The Move. 
</P>
<P>
The invention of Occidental forward John Keister, The Move is no threat to the 
Ickey Shuffle, but it has found its place in the Tiger offense. Keister 
complements his deadly outside jump shot by using, well, his keester. And 
whether he is touched by a defender or not, he punctuates most of his shots by 
skittering across the floor on his derriere. 
</P>
<P>
But the tail of the Tiger wasn't quite wide enough to carry Occidental on 
Saturday night as host Claremont overcame Keister's 34-point performance to 
post a 75-70 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The win moves Claremont (13-10, 6-2) into second place in the SCIAC behind 
Pomona and drops Occidental (15-8, 5-3) into third. 
</P>
<P>
Keister, who didn't hit his stride until the second half, had a chance to tie 
with 30 seconds to play but missed a one-handed, 25-foot shot against a triple 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which trailed by as many as 13 points in the second half, closed 
the gap to 71-70 when Stephen Bertz made a three-point shot with 1:20 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Allbrecht answered with a running shot in the key and then came Keister's 
ill-fated try. 
</P>
<P>
The Stags put the game out of reach when Allbrecht missed a free throw after a 
desperation foul by Occidental. Allbrecht then collected the rebound and scored 
underneath. Occidental trailed, 51-38, with 13 minutes to play when Keister 
decided he wasn't going to take the loss sitting down. 
</P>
<P>
He made a 15-foot jump shot and, a few seconds later, nailed a three-point 
shot. With help from The Move, he drew a foul after that shot, a call that drew 
vehement protest from Stag Coach Dave Wells. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, however, Wells' critique of Keister was more complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Move) is so effective," Wells said. "John's an outstanding player and the 
only frustrating thing is that officials have to call it." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Anderson scored 13 points and grabbed eight rebounds for Occidental and 
Ethan Caldwell added nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont was led by Allbrecht (17 points), Chris Greene (16) and Dominic Nappi 
(15). 
</P>
<P>
With about five minutes remaining in the half, Claremont put together a 9-2 run 
behind Nappi, a freshman from North Hollywood High, to take a 32-26 lead.

SPOTLIGHT ON DAVE YANAI; 
</P>
<P>
BEFORE CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS' RECENT WIN STREAK, ONLY HIS PLAYERS AND PEERS 
SEEMED TO KNOW HOW GOOD THE NATION'S ONLY JAPANESE-AMERICAN COLLEGE BASKETBALL 
COACH IS. NOW THE SECRET IS OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The glare from television camera lights reflected off Dave Yanai's glasses as 
the Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball coach, neatly dressed in a tweed 
jacket, was questioned by reporters after a road victory at Cal State 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Success has come often for Yanai's teams, but the media rush -- such as this 
one in the hallway of the Civic Auditorium in this southern San Joaquin Valley 
town -- is as uncommon for him as snow in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For despite two decades of success as a high school and college coach in the 
shadow of media-rich downtown Los Angeles, the man Coach Bobby Knight of 
Indiana calls "a great coach" has toiled virtually anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai has been at Dominguez Hills for 12 years. Some locals refer to the 
Division II school as "Cal State Carson," and that makes it difficult to 
attract top-notch athletic talent. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai is the only Japanese-American college coach in the United States and has 
been rewarded several times as one of the best at his trade. Twice he was named 
Coach of the Year in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., and once in the 
Division II Western Region. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations over the years with coaches paint a picture of Yanai as a humble, 
hard-working and above-board teacher of basketball, "a coach's coach with no 
gimmicks," according to former UC Berkeley Coach Pete Newell. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Knight: "There isn't a greater guy around." 
</P>
<P>
Newell considers Yanai a well-kept secret: "Dave could compete in any 
conference in any part of the country with less talent than the rest (of the 
teams in the league), and he would win." 
</P>
<P>
Said Yanai's wife of 23 years, Sae, who washed team uniforms when Yanai was at 
Fremont High so her husband could use laundry funds to buy much-needed jerseys 
for his players: "Dave just loves to coach. Always has." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai's Dominguez Hills record of 181-133 is not of mythical proportions. At 
Fremont, he fared better (120-31). According to his peers, he gets every ounce 
of performance out of his players. Many of those players, Yanai concedes, are 
flawed. But his teams are so well prepared that they often win when on paper 
they shouldn't have bothered to show up. Many of his losses have gone down to 
the wire. 
</P>
<P>
He operates on a shoestring budget that includes less than three full-time 
scholarships a year. Walk-on players often start. 
</P>
<P>
"Dominguez Hills has a reputation," said Gardena Councilman Mas Fukai, an 
associate of Yanai. "It is hard to recruit athletes. Still, these young men are 
great individuals when he is done with them." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter can usually turn up a skeleton or two in a coach's closet. Yanai's 
closet is bare, except for the accolades. Friends describe him as intense and 
caring, sincere and knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have anything (worthwhile) inside of you, he will bring it out," said 
Sam Sullivan, who played for Yanai and now coaches basketball at Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
Associates say Yanai is a kojin butsu, a nice, honorable guy, with life's 
priorities in the right order. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not in the mainstream. You don't read much about him, but he is one of 
the real teachers of basketball," Newell said. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai has been active in the Japanese-American community. He plays host to free 
youth camps in Gardena and Orange County several times a year and conducts them 
with the same vigor as practice sessions at Dominguez Hills. At one of those 
camps, said Yanai's nephew, Harvey Kitani, basketball coach at Fairfax High, 
"Yanai worked me so hard I came out of it feeling dizzy." 
</P>
<P>
Explained Newell: "He has so many things going for him. He is a giver, not a 
taker." 
</P>
<P>
Success has usually come with little fanfare at Dominguez Hills. Two years ago, 
when the Toros won a second CCAA title under Yanai with a last-minute victory 
over UC Riverside, there wasn't a reporter in attendance. In a 1988 Sports 
Illustrated story, former Toro Sports Information Director Steve Barr 
complained that he left the school in part because he was frustrated at being 
associated with a winning basketball program that received very little 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Newell suggests that a measure of a coach's ability is in the homage paid by 
other coaches, as in Yanai's selection as CCAA Coach of the Year last season 
when his team finished fourth and failed to qualify for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a gem," said Cal Poly Pomona Coach Dave Bollwinkle. 
</P>
<P>
"If a player can't get along with Yanai, he can't get along with anyone," said 
Biola Coach Dave Holmquist. 
</P>
<P>
"He's some kind of a coach," said Coach John Masi at UC Riverside, which beat 
Dominguez Hills by a single point in January but lost to the Toros in overtime 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Newell says you will seldom find a group of coaches who think that way about an 
opponent, but he thinks he knows why Yanai is so highly regarded: "He has his 
priorities right. Players and academics first. There aren't a lot of coaches 
today interested in that part." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Yanai remembers the cold wind on his face as he rode in the back of a 
pickup down the southern Sierra slope near Bishop. It was the dead of winter, 
1945. Frank was 5 years old when his family was released from a Japanese 
internment camp in the Owens Valley. His younger brother, Dave, 2 1/2, rested 
near his mother's feet on the floor. He was born in the camp, as was one of the 
family's five daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Their father ran a retail liquor business in Los Angeles when Pearl Harbor was 
attacked. Soon he was rounded up and ordered to help build the barracks in the 
internment camp that would house thousands of Japanese from Southern California 
during World War II. The rest of the family was shipped there later. 
</P>
<P>
When the war ended, it was up to each family to find a way out. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was lucky he had a friend with a truck," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
The family returned to Los Angeles and bounced from hotel to hotel, spent a 
year in the basement of a church, then moved to Gardena in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Dave liked Gardena. He stills lives there. It is a city with which he has 
formed "a kinship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his early years, however, Dave was a mischief-maker. He "marched to his own 
agenda," Frank said. He spent the better part of his time at a local bowling 
alley setting pins or in the pool hall. Dave was a hustler. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything to get a little extra money for a hamburger, a malt and some french 
fries," Dave said. "At times I had no direction. I marched to my own drumbeat. 
You could say I lived a full 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
At home, his parents spoke only Japanese. On Saturdays, the children attended a 
Japanese school to remind them of their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Said Frank: "For the first few years of our lives we were really groping, 
trying to understand our parents. It wasn't easy, particularly when we started 
(American) school." 
</P>
<P>
Dave picked up English in kindergarten by watching and listening to other 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"The stereotypical Asian is one of a 'quiet American,' " he explained. "Young 
Japanese children weren't able to speak English as well when they entered 
school, so they learned by watching and doing. When the teacher said it was 
time to take a nap and to rest your head on your desk, you saw the other kids 
in the class putting their heads down on their desks and you did the same. You 
learned from that." 
</P>
<P>
The boys worked in their father's fish-drying business. 
</P>
<P>
"It was used in a soup base for Japanese people," Frank said. The land on which 
they worked in Dominguez Hills would eventually become the site of the 
university where Yanai coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Later the family started a gardening business. 
</P>
<P>
"Both our parents worked, so we were on our own," said Frank. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers found solace in Gardena, despite a tough existence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good town. We were lucky," Frank said. "We had white friends early in 
life and we didn't feel much prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
But what prejudice there was stung Dave. He was taunted in school with chants 
of "Jap! Jap!" Dave retaliated: "I had my share of fights." 
</P>
<P>
As Dave grew older, the prejudice "ebbed away," he said, thanks in part to 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had athletic prowess, kids would give you that measure of respect you 
were looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai coached the Yanai boys in youth baseball and watched Dave mature into a 
fleet-footed outfielder who played at Cal State Long Beach. Dave was active in 
basketball, too, although he was often the shortest player on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my midgets," Fukai said. 
</P>
<P>
Dave feels that he has been successful often at Dominguez Hills because he 
understands the situations that other minority athletes face. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very sensitive to blacks and their plight," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Yanai has made a career of finding unsung minority players, offering 
them an education and turning them into fine players. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask All-American candidate Anthony Blackmon. 
</P>
<P>
The Aliso Village housing projects in East Los Angeles rise three stories above 
the noisy streets and cluttered gutters near the L.A. River. Dave Yanai, 
wearing a suit and tie, pulled his new, full-sized, shiny automobile under the 
front window of a weather-beaten apartment building. He had come to sign a 
player he felt had endless potential, one who could challenge for the CCAA 
Player of the Year honor in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Carter, a Yanai assistant and now coach at Bishop Montgomery High, rode 
next to Yanai. This neighborhood looked so tough, he later confided to 
associates, that he considered not getting out of the car when it stopped at 
Blackmon's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon, his hair in braids, stepped to his front window. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn," he thought. "These guys look like some kind of federal agents." 
</P>
<P>
The pair stepped from the car. Recalled Yanai: "I told Tony, 'You watch. 
Anthony will be out on the street to meet us so the guys in his neighborhood 
know we are all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon materialized shortly and signaled to a few "brothers" in the street. 
He had first met Yanai at the City Section all-star game in 1985. Blackmon did 
not play much in the game and was surprised when an Asian man approached him. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know nothing about Dave Yanai," Blackmon said. "I was sort of 
shocked. I said to myself: 'Oh, an Oriental coach. What a shock.' Then I said: 
'Oh, wow. Well, a coach is a coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon was unsure of his future. He had not received scholarship offers and 
could not afford college. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai offered Blackmon a scholarship: books, tuition and a campus dormitory 
room. Blackmon is living up to Yanai's expectations. He leads the CCAA in 
scoring and rebounding. At least three professional teams have sent scouts to 
watch him play. Five years ago, he didn't figure he'd make it to college. 
</P>
<P>
"Growin' up in my neighborhood, it's hard to say what I would have done had I 
not met Dave Yanai," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Yanai say that he creates a bond with his players. A bond that 
never goes away. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives talk about the time that Ricky Bell, a Heisman Trophy winner in 
football at USC, walked into Yanai's Gardena home unannounced one Saturday 
afternoon. He had played basketball for Yanai at Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave would tutor kids at his home," Fukai said. 
</P>
<P>
And he occasionally gets heartbroken over some things his players do. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer he was asked to deliver a eulogy at the funeral of a former player, 
1975 City Section Player of the Year Ivory Ward. Ward had died from a drug 
overdose. 
</P>
<P>
"He is so close to his players," said Dominguez Hills assistant coach Bart 
Yamachika. "He wants them to succeed so much that when these things happen he 
takes them very hard, maybe a little more hard than most." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai, according to Fukai, cried for weeks after Ward's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his Bloomington office, Knight was long-distance jousting with a 
California reporter when this question was posed: "Have you ever wondered why, 
if Yanai is such a good coach, that he has not gone on to something bigger and 
better, like a Division I school?" 
</P>
<P>
"You ever wonder why you haven't bettered yourself?" Knight snapped. "Maybe 
you're happy as a sportswriter. Maybe he is content where he is." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai claims he has applied for only one Division I job since coming to 
Dominguez Hills. Newell has told him that many jobs are not worth moving up to 
a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel confident that I can handle a Division I job," Yanai said. "In fact, I 
would relish the opportunity, but I am not obsessed with it. . . . Southern 
California is a great place to live and raise children. You don't have to deal 
with all the elements here that you do in a cold-weather city where there is 
snow. I don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai, and others, feel that Yanai is being overlooked because he is a 
Japanese-American. 
</P>
<P>
"He belongs at USC or UCLA. . . . He is a diamond in the rough, and he can't 
get a break," Fukai said. "It's still very much that stereotype of having a 
head coach that is a Japanese-American." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Yanai agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been overlooked because he is a Japanese-American, not black, not 
white. This is basketball, and the guys who make the hiring decisions look at 
him and say, 'Gee, would we be taking a chance hiring him?' " 
</P>
<P>
Newell feels that Yanai has been overlooked: "Unfortunately, the people who 
make the hiring decisions don't have the first clue of what they are looking 
for. They go on newspaper clippings and take coaches who are already on the 
Division I level." 
</P>
<P>
Job openings at several Division I schools, most notably Cal State Fullerton, 
have brought Yanai's name up for speculation. However, Yanai said, the bottom 
line is: "I have a great job I really enjoy. It doesn't pay a lot of money, but 
the people here are great to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai said that if he left Dominguez Hills, he would seek a job with similar 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he stays in the area," said Newell. "If he does leave, he doesn't have 
to have a preponderence of material to win. . . . However, he should leave only 
if the situation is right for him." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai sat in an armchair in a motel room on a recent trip to a game at San Luis 
Obispo. Three coaches were sleeping in the cramped quarters. The TV was turned 
to a college basketball game. Yanai pulled out a half-finished cigar and lit 
up, then reflected on the first 45 years of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very fortunate to be an American," he said, puffing on the cigar. "I am a 
survivor, I guess. It was a great experience growing up like I did. It gave me 
a practical sense of life. It taught me to think ahead so I don't end up on the 
short end of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Yanai let out a sigh, and with it a puff of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it taught me not to be taken for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Then, with a wry smile, he recounted his obscure success with little regret. 
The real kick in his life over the years, he said, has been watching young 
people under his guidance grow as individuals, with basketball merely a vehicle 
teaching them how to get the most out of their abilities.

TOROS KEEP 1ST DESPITE 68-61 MATADOR KILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PAUL McLEOD, Times Staff Writer

<P>
As scripts go, this game couldn't have been written any better for both 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills saw its school-record nine-game winning streak 
collapse along with its inside game at both ends of the court Saturday night, 
but the Toros still remained in a first-place tie in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. because UC Riverside was upset at Cal State Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cal State Northridge, desperately trying to stay in the running for 
a post-season playoff berth, clawed back into contention with a 68-61 victory 
over the visiting Toros. 
</P>
<P>
The CSUN win before 1,021 spectators may have been a blessing in disguise for 
Dominguez Hills, said Toro Coach Dave Yanai, whose team is already assured of 
one of the CCAA's four playoff spots. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've had a good stretch of nine in a row, you'd rather have a loss in 
this situation, where you don't play well, rather than a loss later in the 
postseason tournament," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield's 88-75 overtime win against Riverside may make this one even 
easier to take, although Yanai was rather reticent about his team's loss. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us a chance to refocus and get better on (overcoming) certain 
weaknesses that we saw tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most notably, Dominguez Hills (10-2, 18-7) showed a marked weakness in both 
post areas, particularly in its otherwise steller defense, which is ranked 
third in the nation. The Matadors (6-6, 15-10), led by Alan Fraser, who powered 
inside for 17 points, repeatedly got easy lay-ups. 
</P>
<P>
And when Dominguez Hills was on offense, it made just a half-dozen shots from 
10 feet in. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a twisting, driving lay-in by Bryan Dell'Amico with one second left in 
the half gave Dominguez Hills a 37-35 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy for the Toros in the first half, despite shooting 60.7% from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills made seven of its first 10 field goals and outscored the 
Matadors 16-9 in the first 6 1/2 minutes of the game. Northridge cut the lead 
to four points several times, then got within two points on a basket by Kendell 
McDaniels with 8:30 to go in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Kris Brodowski stole the ball at midcourt from Robert 
Barksdale and passed to Derrick Gathers, who scored. That tied the score at 30. 
Barksdale retaliated a minute later with a three-point shot, but baskets by 
Fraser and Karl Becker and a free throw helped Northridge to a 35-33 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Baskets by Anthony Blackmon and Dell'Amico ended the scoring for the half. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge opened a 51-43 lead with 11:05 left in the game. Matsubara's 
three-point basket helped Northridge regain the lead, 43-41, with 14:05 left, 
and his free throw 15 seconds later pushed the Matador lead to three. Sandy 
Brown capped a 10-6 scoring spurt with two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon scored five of the next seven points for Dominguez Hills. Then Derrick 
Clark stole the ball from Becker at mid-court and made a lay-up to cut the 
Northridge lead to 53-51 with 6:38 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Clark missed a chance to tie the game with a one-and-one after Fraser was 
called for an offensive foul away from the ball, and Brown's tip-in at the 
other end upped the Matadors' lead. 
</P>
<P>
Dell'Amico made a three-point shot, but then McDaniels answered with a dunk, 
57-54. That spurred a 9-4 run by the Matadors, who led 63-56 with 2:11 to go. 
</P>
<P>
Barksdale scored, Gathers hit one of two free throws, then Blackmon cut the 
lead to 64-61 on a three-point basket with 1:15 to go. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge missed two chances in close the next time it had the ball. Kevin 
Shaw rebounded for Dominguez Hills, but Jemarl Baker stuffed Barksdale's 
driving lay-in with 26 seconds remaining, and with 16 seconds left Barksdale's 
three-point try lipped the rim. Barksdale fouled Baker on the loose ball three 
seconds later and, Baker hit both free throws to make it 66-61. 
</P>
<P>
Blackmon missed a three-point attempt with eight seconds left, and Dell'Amico 
fouled Baker, who iced the game with two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge 76, Dominguez Hills 53. The Lady Toros suffered their ninth 
consecutive loss in CCAA play, while the Lady Matadors greatly improved their 
playoff chances. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills (1-10, 6-17) shot 43.2% from the floor, one of its best totals 
in recent games, but the team committed 31 turnovers. Connie McKenney led 
Dominguez Hills with 13 points, and Kathy Goggin had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Five players scored in double figures for Northridge (6-4, 18-7).

BLAZING TRAILS; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER PIONEERING CAREER AT OBSCURE CES, LITTLEJOHN HOPES COLLEGES COME CALLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marcus Littlejohn knows that his legacy at the Sherman Oaks Center for Enriched 
Studies is secure. He's a pioneering athlete at the small magnet school in 
Reseda, the best player on the first team in school history to play in a "real" 
basketball league. 
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn, a 6-foot-1 senior guard, averaged 25.3 points a game in the 
Knights' first season since stepping out of the obscurity of the City Section's 
Magnet League. After the team compiled a four-year record of 78-6, the Knights 
earned a promotion to the City 3-A Division and membership in the Northeast 
League. CES has averaged nearly 20 wins a season the past four years but 
struggled to a 9-11 record this season, including a 4-8 mark and a fourth-place 
finish in the five-team Northeast League. In its first crack at the so-called 
big time, CES missed the playoff cut. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Knights have arrived, punctuating their emergence as a legitimate 
3-A team with a 62-61 upset of league champion Wilson last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really been happy here and I hope I'll be remembered as a pioneer," 
Littlejohn said. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean he didn't try to leave CES, a school of 1,500 students 
from the fourth through the 12th grades that is part of the L. A. Unified 
School District's voluntary integration program. Littlejohn, who lives in the 
Fairfax area of Los Angeles, entered CES as a seventh-grader and nearly left 
the school before his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
After the Knights failed to gain admittance to a 3-A league two years ago, 
Littlejohn became disheartened and considered a time-honored option at CES. The 
Knights always have drawn talented basketball players but they left for 
mainstream schools once they reached ninth grade. Former CES students include 
Anthony Cook, who went to Van Nuys and then the University of Arizona, Jason 
Mathews (St. Monica, Pittsburgh) and Andre Durity (Fairfax, St. Mary's). 
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn hoped to travel similar territory and considered transferring to 
Taft or El Camino Real. Working out the logistics through the school district's 
Permits With Transportation program proved easier than persuading Littlejohn's 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Mable Garrett has raised Littlejohn since he arrived in Los Angeles from 
Oklahoma as a 2-year-old suffering from asthma. Both the climate and his 
grandmother suited him, so he never rejoined his mother, who now lives in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett insisted that Littlejohn attend a magnet school but when he requested 
the transfer she agreed to consider it. But not for long. It was back to CES. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really disappointed at first," Littlejohn said. "I wanted to go to Taft 
or ECR because they were big schools in established leagues. They play in front 
of scouts and college coaches and I thought I would get some exposure." 
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn returned to CES for his junior and senior years and now that his 
high school career is over, he harbors no regrets academically or socially 
about staying at CES. But he faces major doubts about his basketball future. 
</P>
<P>
Despite impressive numbers, no colleges have shown interest in him. After 
averaging 33 points as a junior, his scoring suffered only slightly at the 3-A 
level this season. He scored 505 points in 20 games and finished with a 
flourish, scoring 32, 30 and 42 points in his final three games. He also had a 
40-point game in a December tournament against St. Monica, a traditional 
Southern Section power that has advanced to the second round of the Division 
5-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Littlejohn also averaged five assists and 9.5 rebounds a game despite playing 
guard. He converted 59% of his field-goal attempts and was even better from 
three-point territory, making 35 of 47, a stunning 74.5%. 
</P>
<P>
CES Coach Mac Becker, who has an obvious bias, calls Littlejohn "the biggest 
sleeper in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Davis, El Camino Real's assistant coach, offers only a slightly more 
tempered appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a Division I player," he said. "We need a Marcus Littlejohn. 
If some college wants to know about him, I'll recommend him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the example of Mitchell Butler, who signed with UCLA despite playing at 
tiny Oakwood School in North Hollywood, Littlejohn fears that his experience at 
a small school holds him back. And he has company. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing in a league where he stands out and if he played at the 4-A level 
he might not score as many points," Taft Coach Jim Woodard said. "But he might 
have developed more if he played at this level." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Cassidy, coach of Cal State Northridge's Division II program, hasn't 
recruited Littlejohn, either. 
</P>
<P>
"If he played against Cleveland all the time, his skills would be better. If 
you're always doing the same things and getting away with it and then someone 
takes that away, what do you do? It's a big jump from CES to a four-year 
school." 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy has seen that jump firsthand. Northridge offered Dannton Jackson a 
scholarship last year, making the 6-foot-5 forward the first CES graduate to 
sign a national letter of intent. Jackson, who is redshirting this season, 
understands what Littlejohn is going through. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I was in the same spot as Marcus," he said. "I was really scared and 
thought I wasn't going to get a scholarship. I thought I would never make it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go to a junior college because Sherman Oaks was home. I 
wanted to find another home right away." 
</P>
<P>
Like Littlejohn, Jackson considered leaving CES. He grew up in Reseda and 
always dreamed of playing for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept seeing my friends leave and have success somewhere else," he said. "I 
thought of transferring but my parents and I thought that CES was the place to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting doubts aside, Littlejohn has reached the same conclusion. Even if he 
winds up at a junior college next season, he'll always have his CES memories. 
Sherman Oaks is the kind of school that seems to breed loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a . . . family here," he said. "The teachers are close to you and 
they care about you. And I know practically everybody. There are only two new 
students in the senior class. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied with what I accomplished here. I can say I started something. We 
can get people to want to come here and play basketball."

BRANHAM GIVES PRO BOWLING ANOTHER SHOT AS TOUR SWINGS PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only one thing was truly simple during Patty Branham's childhood. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling. 
</P>
<P>
There were some tough times. Her parents, Ethel and Frank Cummings, were 
divorced when she was 11. A few years later, Frank, a mailman, was hit by a 
motorcycle while walking his route and had to retire because of the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
There weren't any frills. Ethel ran a snack bar at the post office in Point 
Loma. She scrimped and cut corners to allow Patty to have the opportunity to 
pursue her hobby and biggest source of enjoyment, bowling. 
</P>
<P>
It is only recently that Patty Branham, an El Cajon resident who will be 
continuing a comeback of sorts in the Ladies Professional Bowlers Tour 
tournament starting today at Kearny Mesa Bowl, has realized the sacrifices her 
mother made so she could bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom's not a complainer," Branham said. "I was just a greedy little kid. She 
was just the proudest mom there ever was. She would sacrifice everything she 
had to for me to be able to bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Bowling was the biggest and probably one of the best things about Branham's 
childhood. She was always two years ahead of her class in school, so she says 
she never really fit in. Despite her high IQ, she says she didn't apply herself 
in classes. And for financial reasons, she had to get a full-time job as a 
secretary after she was graduated from La Jolla High School at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
But bowling came easy. It was fun and rewarding, and she was a natural. She 
started when she was 7, going to the bowling alley with her parents. She never 
needed to practice. Her basic, four-step approach and smooth delivery earned 
her recognition. She was chosen Southern California junior bowler of the year 
three times in a row, something that had never been done before and hasn't 
since. 
</P>
<P>
Branham, now 25, is deciding which turn to take at the crossroads of her life. 
She quit bowling professionally 2 1/2 years ago because it had become a chore, 
and she wasn't doing as well as she had as a junior. Yet she hasn't found 
anything else that gives her as much of a lift. 
</P>
<P>
Branham is an office manager, well-liked and greatly respected by her 
co-workers. As good as she is at her profession, there's something missing. 
</P>
<P>
"I spend a lot of hours (at work), and I'm very good at what I do, but it 
doesn't get me any recognition. I like attention, I'll admit it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, after she quit bowling professionally, she was fulfilled by the 
accomplishments of her husband, George, a bowler on the men's tour. In November 
of 1986, George Branham became the first black bowler to win a major tournament 
at the Brunswick Memorial World Open in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
It was a big deal. Many tears were shed, Patty said. It was George's proudest 
moment as a professional, and she was there to share it and enjoy it with him. 
</P>

George Branham has won another major tournament and earned $98,000 in the past 
two years. Initially, his success was a source of happiness for Patty. But that 
began to fade. She was no longer in the limelight, and he was. It became tough. 
</P>
<P>
"I got upset about it," she said. "All of a sudden, I was nothing. I've 
actually had it said to me that it might have played a part in my quitting 
(bowling). When I quit it was very sudden. I just said 'I'm not ever going to 
do this again.' " 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a big surprise to Patty's parents. Both knew she had talent but 
lacked the killer instinct that separates a top junior bowler from a top 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures of the professional tour combined stiff competition with the need 
to pay bills. Branham says she has never seriously considered giving up her day 
job to join the tour full time because the money is too uncertain. As an office 
manager, the check is always there. As a bowler, the size of the check is 
directly proportional to the number of pins knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
In junior bowling, Branham had always been the best. She didn't worry about 
being beaten because it happened rarely. She was on top. 
</P>
<P>
When she joined the professional tour, she was just another face, looking at 
her opponents, knowing they were as good if not better. She never bowled as 
well under that pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she was more intimidated by the older women," Ethel Cummings said. 
"She's not a real strong competitor. I wish she had more of an 'I'll get you' 
attitude. She's never had that real push. I don't think anybody would have 
touched her if she had." 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter of self-confidence. Branham always has been good at what she 
does, but she also has been somewhat afraid to try new things. Take basketball, 
a sport she loves to watch. She is nearly 6-feet but has always been leery of 
playing it. She doesn't like to feel as if she's out of her element. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe that's another of the reasons she quit bowling professionally. 
</P>
<P>
"When it was just for fun, she enjoyed it," Frank Cummings said. "She didn't 
like the pressure too much." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, while she sorts through what to do with her future, she has decided 
to compete again in nearby tournaments. It's a confidence booster of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
Her first tournament was in Canoga Park last month. She finished a respectable 
13th. Last week at Fullerton, she just missed making the championship cut. Her 
average (207) is at an all-time high. So she's brimming with confidence for her 
hometown tournament this week. Confidence, with a dash of caution. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good because I bowl there all the time," she said. "But I also know 
when you feel comfortable about things, that's when you tend to fail." 
</P>
<P>
A funny thing happened, though, at Canoga Park. Branham bowled in a small 
warmup tournament. En route to winning and earning free entry into the 
professional event, she did something she has wanted to do for years. She 
bowled her first perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe bowling has become fun again. And maybe it's the lift she's looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody," she said, "needs something they can have self respect about."

<TEXT>
<P>
A note from Scott McTiernan of the little San Juan Guest Ranch in the Colorado 
Rockies tells of summer plans. The season opens June 1 with a thrifty package 
($700) that includes a room in the ranch house, meals, a horse, sightseeing by 
Jeep, fishing (McTiernan supplies poles, bait). 
</P>
<P>
New in '89 will be two spring flower photo workshops (June 11-17 and June 
18-24). Film is developed nightly with critiques by professional photographer 
Chuck Dresner. Two "autumn colors" photo workshops are planned for Sept. 24-30, 
Oct. 1-7. The price remains the same throughout the season, whether guests 
attend the workshops or just ride, fish and sightsee (or else just laze in the 
shade of the towering ponderosa pine outside the ranch). 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan is next door to the village of Ouray (the "Switzerland of 
America"). Meals served family-style. Morning and afternoon or all-day rides. 
Jeep trips to ghost towns hidden in the San Juan Mountains. This is a small, 
friendly ranch. Only 25 guests. Meadows reach out to the mountains. A white 
rail fence, red barn. Dudes come all the way from Europe to saddle up at this 
friendly little ranch.

THE INSIDE SKINNY ON HOW TO EAT AND RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I could not believe my ears the other day when a family friend dropped by the 
house, sat on the couch in my office and suggested that she might never travel 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't mean that," I said. "You love to travel. You're as close to being a 
complete travel nut as anyone we know." 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm some kinda travel nut, you can bet your life it's round. Look at me. 
One month in Europe and I've turned into a blivit." (A blivit is 10 pounds of 
anything crammed into a five-pound bag.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Always on a Diet 
</P>
<P>
"It's so unfair," she said, "that at the time in your life when you can finally 
afford to travel, when you can go to the places where they have all those 
fabulous foods, you're always on a diet." 
</P>
<P>
"Who told you to diet?" I asked. "Some overweight doctor? An aerobics teacher 
who looks like she's made out of pipe cleaners? Or have you been watching TV 
soap operas or the commercials with those actresses and models with the 
cavernous cheeks who all look alike. You don't want to look like them." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, don't I?" She took a tissue from her purse. 
</P>
<P>
"Who are the world's great painters of beauty? Botticelli, Rubens, Rembrandt, 
Vermeer, that's who. Any one of them would have picked you in a minute as a 
model over the Jane Fondas and the Chers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I thought I was making progress but for some reason she was looking even 
sadder. 
</P>
<P>
"You're the picture of health. Not a wrinkle in your face," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's because I've filled them all up with fat," she answered. "And my 
clothes don't fit anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"Disuse makes fabric stiffen." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about the clothes I wore on the trip." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well, hand-laundering in hotel rooms shrinks clothes." 
</P>
<P>
"You're a good friend," she said, "but I really don't think you know what 
you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh?" I answered. "Oh? Well, you know how much I travel and it just so happens 
I've worn the same belt size for 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
"But you're wearing it about a foot lower now than you used to." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, take my word for it, you look great." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ready to Cry 
</P>
<P>
She started to cloud up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean that kind of great, I mean good. Don't worry about dieting. You 
don't have any problem but maybe a little jet sag." 
</P>
<P>
"That's jet lag. Jet lag. There is no such thing as jet sag." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," I said. "I meant water retention." 
</P>
<P>
"Get off it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"What about air retention?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Joyce?" she asked, and walked out into the back yard where my wife was 
doing a little gardening. 
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed I looked into the matter. I learned that our family 
friend was not unusual in her misery. Weight gain has been worrying a lot of 
travelers throughout the world. Some almost to the point of hysteria. Is it 
time to be hysterical? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. And I believe I have something to support that opinion. 
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to point out that what follows is not purely my creation. Some 
has been gleaned from experts as august as Julia Child and Mike Royko. 
</P>
<P>
The words that follow are not those of some collection of doctors and 
nutritionists (probably skinny) hanging around the lunchroom at the Mayo 
Clinic, Johns Hopkins or Boston General. 
</P>
<P>
This is the wisdom of real people from the eating and traveling public whom 
I've met at Weight Watchers, where I am a life member, or with whom I've shared 
membership in any of a dozen other diet groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Organized List 
</P>
<P>
This is not merely a rehash of known diet studies. I have taken the liberty of 
organizing information seldom considered and forming 10 conclusions that should 
be of special interest to anyone who has ever worried about gaining weight 
while traveling. 
</P>
<P>
1. Any food that is the national dish of the country visited is not fattening 
and should be eaten out of consideration for your host or hostess. Asking for 
seconds in such circumstances should be thought of as a positive international 
political gesture. 
</P>
<P>
2. Food served at birthday, anniversary and bon voyage parties, including 
wedding cakes with a written message in frosting on top, aren't fattening 
because they are eaten not for nourishment but to honor another person. 
Thirty-six percent of those familiar with this "fact," however, are of the 
opinion that such eating causes the person being honored to put on weight. 
</P>
<P>
3. Hors d'oeuvres contain no calories. Though the term is French for "outside 
of work," it is defined as an appetizer. As something can't build appetite and 
satisfy it at the same time, hors d'oeuvres must be calorie-free. Reason alone 
tells us this. 
</P>
<P>
4. Food eaten while standing and talking contains no calories. The reason for 
this is unclear, but it has been known, if not well-publicized, for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
5. When traveling with one's children the eating of foods to illustrate the 
potability of certain dishes, known as "demonstration food," is non-caloric. 
That's as in: "Try it, dear. See, mother is eating some. It's good. See? Isn't 
that delicious? Watch mother take another bite. Umm . . . and another." 
</P>
<P>
6. When eaten in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany or the United Kingdom, 
foods containing chocolate are not fattening. They may even be considered to 
have negative calories when incorporated into a national food and eaten 
standing up. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Black Forest cake, when eaten in front of an open refrigerator, 
is covered under three or four other nonfattening rules and is therefore 
counted negatively, meaning (theoretically) that the eater should lose weight 
while eating it. 
</P>
<P>
7. The "old food" or "hard food" rule. When one discovers old food in a jacket 
pocket or among carry-on luggage, the food may be consumed with no thought of 
weight gain if it has hardened. The calories are assumed to have either leaked 
out or to have bled off into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
One of the experts opined, from personal experience, that it is wise to 
restrict consumption to one's own old food, and to be able to identify it 
before consuming it. 
</P>
<P>
8. The definition of a calorie is the amount of heat required to raise 1 gram 
of water through 1 degree centigrade, so the "refrigerator rule" may be 
considered. Standing before an open refrigerator, which tends to lower body 
heat, would use up more calories than the individual might consume. 
</P>
<P>
The caloric intake might be virtually eliminated if the eater also holds an 
unthawed ice tray under each arm while snacking. 
</P>
<P>
9. To "even up" leftover cake, pie, pudding or casserole dishes for aesthetic 
reasons is not fattening. Trifle is excluded because it never gets completely 
evened. 
</P>
<P>
10. On a recent trip to Poland our group had lunch at a hotel where we were 
served two varieties of Polish dumplings. Several members of the party who had 
eaten inordinate amounts voiced concern. 
</P>
<P>
Our official Polish state guide, when asked if the dumplings were fattening, 
answered, "Certainly not. You are not going to digest them so they cannot 
possibly make you fat. In fact, your bodies will expend so much energy just 
trying to process those dumplings that you will probably lose weight." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he felt the same theory applied to certain other ethnic, 
dumpling-type foods made from unsalted crackers, adding: "There may be a 
temporary weight gain, such as if one had eaten a small cannonball, but it soon 
passes." 
</P>
<P>
Please bear in mind that although expressed by worthy and sincere people, the 
above are opinions. You may accept them or take them with a grain of salt, but 
do not, under any conditions, stop traveling. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. A grain of salt contains no calories.

HOSPITALITY WARM IN LAKE REGION OF CHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIA GINDICK, Gindick is a free-lance writer living in Monterey, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PUERTO MONTT, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're fine in these parts as long as you stay on the Pan-American Highway, a 
humble but paved two-lane thoroughfare that runs through this nation like the 
seam on a string bean, then continues north through Central America, stretches 
up the Western states and Canada, finally dead-ending at Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
But turn off the highway and it's like wandering through Alice's looking glass. 
The asphalt road suddenly becomes gravel, even rock. The low vegetation, 
punctuated by occasional foothills, melds into dense forests that open to post 
card-like vistas of meadows leading down to azure blue lakes, backdropped by 
snow-tipped volcanoes. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of life are only occasional: a donkey and cart, a barn, a sprawling ranch 
house. After about 40 minutes of bouncing along the road, wondering if it's 
possible for a rock to shoot right through the bottom of the car, you might 
pass through a village . . . the kind with a restaurant, market, school, 
church, and maybe a hardware store. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heading South 
</P>
<P>
Even Chileans from Santiago -- a sophisticated city unexpectedly European in 
flavor, though its smog, sprawl and traffic congestion have been likened to the 
worst of Los Angeles -- contend that the southern part of their country, 
particularly the Lake Region, is like nothing they know. 
</P>
<P>
The pace is slower here. There's a train daily, but planes fly between Santiago 
and Puerto Montt only a few times a week. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional Chilean hospitality, which in Santiago is akin to visiting the 
Deep South of the United States, goes even deeper in southern Chile. The hotel 
bars of soap are bath-size, bed turndown service is routine, and at holidays 
such as Easter a little gift -- maybe a delicate straw basket with a marzipan 
bunny -- is likely to be left in your room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rivers and Lakes 
</P>
<P>
The Lake District is where Chileans send you to get great scenery. It's a large 
expanse of country. The Region de Los Lagos has nine lakes, six rivers, four 
volcanoes and covers 26,649 square miles. It backs into Region de la Arucania, 
which has six lakes, four volcanoes and two rivers with four tributaries, 
covering 12,534 square miles. The weather, even in the summer months of 
December to March, is about like California's Monterey Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
If it is geographically far from civilization, the Lake District is even more 
remote psychologically. It's the tranquillity that does it. At times -- and it 
probably doesn't matter which lake you're visiting -- the stillness is almost 
unearthly. But the area does offer a variety of activities: boating, fishing, 
tennis, horseback riding, hiking and swimming and, at night, discos for 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Yet our first morning, awakening at Hotel Ralun -- an elegant fishing lodge 90 
minutes west of Puerto Montt on the Reloncavi Estuary -- the prospect of a fun 
activity seemed less enticing than just sitting on the porch with a pisco sour 
and watching the shadows of the sun play on the low mountains across the bay. 
</P>
<P>
There was more of the same several evenings later, as the sun set between two 
mountains seemingly as close as the southern edge of Lake Ronca. I was in a 
lawn chair, pisco sour in hand, on the beach on the northern shore. About 30 
yards behind me was Calcurrupe, a converted farmhouse that operates as a 
pension. The setting there is more tropical than the mountainous Ralun, though 
both places have wonderful gardens and curious trees with flowers that are used 
to make jam. 
</P>
<P>
Getting there, we'd had another jarring hour of rocky roads until we reached a 
tiny river that could only be crossed by a 10-minute ferry ride. Somehow, 
having that brief delay gets you in the mood for what's to come -- a place with 
no phone and nothing to do except read, swim, hike, fish, stroll in the gardens 
and eat huge healthy meals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The National Drink 
</P>
<P>
A few words about pisco sours, Chile's national drink: It's a wine-based 
cocktail similar to a margarita, but without the salt or ice. Piscos are 
one-third lemon juice which, health-conscious Chileans point out, makes them a 
good source of Vitamin C. They are also so easy to consume that one member of 
our group started hers at 10:30 a.m. daily, claiming they relaxed her bad back. 
</P>
<P>
Rita de Hadida is owner-proprietor of Calcurrupe and her story is almost 
typical of this country. Swiss-born, she immigrated to southern Chile more than 
50 years ago with her mother, met and married a Chilean with whom she farmed 
and had six children. Chile is a nation of immigrants, many of them pursued by 
a government hoping to stock its underpopulated farmlands with hard-working 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Of course the Spanish were first, conquering the country during the 16th 
Century and so displacing the Indian population that today the Araucanian 
Indians account for only 250,000 of this country's 12.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The early 1800s, however, brought Italians and Swiss, and in the 1850s, lured 
by a developer named Vincente Perez Rosales promising plenty of fertile land 
for farming, the first big migration of Germans arrived in southern Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Germans have melded into the population, with Spanish now their 
first language and their skin tanned from hours of working the soil, it's not 
unusual for an otherwise small, nondescript restaurant to include a brochen or 
weinerschnitzel on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
Prices in southern Chile are refreshing: a large double in the newly 
refurbished wing of the Grand Hotel Pucan, in the resort town of Pucon on Lake 
Villarica, is $55 U.S., and includes breakfast. A white alpaca shawl is $17. 
And dinner for five, including pre-dinner drinks, two bottles of wine, 
appetizers, desert and the fresh fish that Chileans cook so well averaged $100 
everywhere we went. 
</P>
<P>

Board, 510 W. 6th St., Suite 1210, Los Angeles 90014; (213) 627-4293.

TOURISTS FINDING SURPRISES IN CARD TRICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine trying to use your credit card and finding that you can't because a 
hotel, car-rental company or restaurant has reserved the money. 
</P>
<P>
Establishments that accept your credit card are allowed to reserve the amount 
you plan to spend. And sometimes they add more than that amount. 
</P>
<P>
With a car rental, the extra money is to cover possible damages to the car. At 
a hotel, the extra might cover meals, phone calls and other services. 
</P>
<P>
Many travelers have discovered, often at inopportune moments, that such a hold 
has been placed against their credit-card limit. But there is a trend toward 
discouraging this procedure. 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1 in New York City, credit on a card can't be reserved for amounts 
over the cost of the services unless the credit-card owner is notified in 
writing of the amount to be blocked and he or she agrees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Complaints Yet 
</P>
<P>
In California, Herschel Elkins, deputy state attorney general, said: "We 
haven't received any complaints about this practice in hotels, though we have 
gotten some about car-rental companies." 
</P>
<P>
As of Jan. 1 car-rental companies were precluded from the practice in 
California. Regulations governing such pre-authorizations against credit-card 
limits may spread to other states. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that other states are looking at comparable regulation, and we expect 
some will pass similar laws," said Larry Chervenak, president of a hotel 
consulting company. "Most hotels just reserve the amount of room nights plus a 
reasonable amount for other hotel services. But they don't necessarily tell the 
guest what this pre-authorization is, which they should do. And a minority of 
hotels have overdone their pre-authorizations." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Visa is issuing new regulations to member banks that call for them 
to prohibit car-rental firms from adding estimates to Visa charge cards beyond 
the basic rental cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right to Make Estimates 
</P>
<P>
Even though merchants have the legal right to make estimates, card users often 
don't realize that these pre-authorizations reduce the amount they can charge 
against their credit-card limit. Cases have been reported where the car-rental 
cost was $100 but the pre-authorization was for more than $1,000 to cover 
possible damage to the car. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels establish credit before handing over a key to a guest who uses a credit 
card. Some hotels simply total the room nights, plus tax, and get 
pre-authorization for that amount. Others add a contingency sum for incidental 
tabs. 
</P>
<P>
Policies vary on how hotels handle the pre-authorization procedure. Some hotels 
may negotiate agreements with credit-card companies on what limit the 
credit-card firm will be responsible for if the cardholder doesn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an agreement with every credit-card company whose card we accept, 
whereby if the card is valid, our hotel is protected up to a certain floor 
limit," said Dennis Koci, vice president of front desk and guest services of 
Hilton Hotels. "If the card is valid, the floor limit is the amount for which 
the credit-card company will guarantee payment, whether or not they get paid." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Options Listed 
</P>
<P>
In general, Koci said, if a hotel doesn't have such an agreement with a 
credit-card company, the hotel has other options. 
</P>
<P>
"A hotel can validate the card and then create an internal floor limit and 
monitor this limit. This is at the hotel's risk and not the credit-card 
company's. If the guest's charges start to reach this limit, the hotel would 
then seek a pre-authorization. Another option is to pre-authorize when the 
guest checks in." 
</P>
<P>
Most hotels just validate credit cards, establish internal floor limits and 
then watch a guest's bill closely, Koci said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, pre-authorization is sought for the amount of 
the room, plus tax, said John Eleftheriou, the Roosevelt's director of finance. 
</P>
<P>
"We advise the guest verbally of this amount and ask if he expects to use other 
services, and what extra amount can be held for this purpose." 
</P>
<P>
The guest's credit limit is then monitored, and if a charge takes the guest 
over the limit, the guest is contacted about means of payment, which can mean 
another pre-authorization against the credit-card limit, according to 
Eleftheriou. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at restaurants, a waiter may put down a greater amount than the bill in 
expectation of a tip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protecting Yourself 
</P>
<P>
"Your tip may be much less, but the amount processed to the credit-card company 
still goes through and can be held against your credit-card limit for a number 
of days, until it's matched up with the expenditure. Meanwhile, you're stuck 
with reduced use of your credit card." 
</P>
<P>
To protect yourself against excessive pre-authorizations and simply to keep in 
touch with your credit-card limit, always ask what amount is being held or 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good policy to follow any time the final price of what you will pay 
for is not known at the time you present your card," Koci said. 
</P>
<P>
However, disclosure of pre-authorization amounts doesn't necessarily prevent 
problems with your credit card limit. 
</P>
<P>
"Vendors don't always release the unused amount of the pre-authorization, which 
should be done when the expenditure is known," Koci said. "If every vendor 
processed the specific charge properly, there wouldn't be any difficulties with 
the credit lines of card-holders." 
</P>
<P>
When you settle your bill, ask any vendor who has made a pre-authorization 
against your credit-card limit if he or she has released any amount over the 
specific charge.

BASSINETS OLD HAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed Peter Greenberg's article in The Savvy Traveler on "Nursery at 25,000 
Feet" (Jan. 29), but he did not do his homework. Pan Am, an American carrier, 
has offered bassinets since its first 747 took off. They must be ordered ahead 
of time but are available on 747 equipment.

LIKED ST. JOHN, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We read with interest the Jan. 29 article by Frank Riley about St. John in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. We enjoyed a wonderful vacation on that island recently. 
An excellent system of open-air taxis operates there as a sort of informal bus 
service. Car rental is very expensive ($340 to rent a small Jeep for one week, 
including insurance and tax) and there is virtually nowhere to park in the tiny 
town of Cruz Bay (at which one arrives from St. Thomas). 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to stay in Cruz Bay or at Cinnamon Campground and enjoy St. John 
without renting a car, or just renting a car for one or two days. You can even 
visit the petroglyphs on Reef Bay Trail by taking advantage of the National 
Park Service weekly guided hike that provides transportation for hikers from 
Cruz Bay to the trail and back. Reservations are required. Visitors should take 
a strong sunscreen and insect repellent, as these items are essential and cost 
a fortune there.

FAMILIAR PARIS

Always saving the Travel Section for last, what an extra treat to see the 
wonderful picture of Paris (Jerry Hulse, Feb. 5). I noticed that he took the 
beautiful photograph of the Seine and Notre Dame from Pont de la Tournelle. At 
that exact location I was married aboard a 60-foot cruise boat with Notre Dame 
as a background. We lived in Paris two years.

A FIND UP THE NILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reading Slater and Basch's account of viewing Upper Egypt from A&amp;K's Sun 
Boat (Jan. 29) recalled my wonderful experience aboard the Atlas last December. 
I have received so many excellent tips, both for myself and for 
Partners-In-Travel through Jerry Hulse's Travel Tips, that I would like to 
share with your readers. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlas has perhaps 40 comfortably sized cabins with bath, a pleasant bar 
lounge, two sun decks and mini-pool and shop. The food is good, service 
attentive and courteous. There is no resident Egyptologist but knowledgeable 
tour guides are provided. The all-inclusive price for the five-day, four-night 
excursion was $299 per person, double occupancy, a real bargain. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlas is one of four properties run by Eastmar, which unfortunately has no 
representative in the United States. It evidently is well-known to European 
operators; my sailing included a group from England, and we were succeeded by a 
group from Kuoni Tours.

FOOTLOOSE IN MAINE: BAR HARBOR OFFERS THE BEST OF TWO CENTURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY, Beyer and Rabey are Los Angeles travel writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BAR HARBOR, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This lovely old island town used to be a social enclave the equal of tony 
summer resorts in which mansions were stately, cars and yachts lengthy and 
bloodlines even longer. 
</P>
<P>
The majestic Victorian homes and summer cottages are still here, but many are 
now B&amp;Bs. And most of the 100-footers that tack into the harbor come from 
abroad or from other domestic ports. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you'll find the only three-masted schooner in Maine anchored here, and 
working boats keep bay traffic brisk. 
</P>
<P>
Bar Harbor really gives you the best of two centuries: the mannered life style 
and gracious homes of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and an energetic, 
outdoor-oriented lineup of activities centered on the water and nearby Acadia 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Acadia was the first national park created east of the Mississippi river, a 
wonderland of mountains, lakes, valleys carved by glaciers and rock-shored 
inlets. 
</P>
<P>
To there: Fly United, American or TWA nonstop to Boston. Take USAir, 
Continental or Northwest with one stop. The Eastern Bar Harbor Express flies 
from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give the town and island two or three days, another if 
you're a serious fisherman. Lodging prices are moderate, even in summer. Dining 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: Average summer temperatures are in the 80s, with cooler 
nights calling for a sweater or wrap. Mid-June to mid-July is beautiful. It's 
crowded until September, with foliage reaching its peak in early October. 
You'll need a rental car, moped, bike or kayak to get the most from the town, 
island and national park. Summer swimming is enjoyable, but other seasons call 
for a fur-lined wet suit. 
</P>
<P>
Settling in: The Mira Monte Inn (69 Mt. Desert St.; $65 to $105 B&amp;B double) 
is one of Bar Harbor's first summer "cottages," dating from 1864. It's a 
bay-windowed Victorian with wrap-around porch owned by charming and chatty 
Marian Burns, who makes blueberry muffins and other breads for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Monte guests have their choice of twin, double, queen or king-size beds in 
rooms awash with antiques and period furniture, plus cable TV. In addition to 
using the facilities of Bar Harbor's swimming and tennis club nearby, visitors 
can join other guests in the Mira Monte living room each afternoon for 
refreshments and to quiz native Burns on the Bar Harbor-Acadia scene. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at Canoe Point (Hulls Cove; $50-$150 B&amp;B double, depending on room 
size and season) is by the water with its own rocky beach, two miles from Bar 
Harbor and a quarter of a mile from the entrance to Acadia park. Views of the 
ocean, Frenchman's Bay and pine forests are spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
Owner-innkeeper Don Johnson has transformed this secluded inn into an exquisite 
country house: old chests, a field-stone fireplace, four-posters, dining deck 
and book nooks. Johnson whips up full breakfasts of French toast, quiches and 
the like. 
</P>
<P>
Wonder View Motor Lodge (Eden St.; $56-$90 double) rises on a wooded hill just 
above town, on the site of the former estate of mystery writer Mary Roberts 
Rinehart. Her home was destroyed in a 1947 fire that leveled 200 houses. 
Hilltop views are the best in town. Rooms have large windows, some with 
balconies, handsome grounds and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Lobster, shellfish, seafood and lake fish are 
specialties. Menus also boast of fresh daily clams, scallops, shrimp, trout, 
haddock, swordfish and salmon. 
</P>
<P>
Lobster and crab rolls are stuffed to brimming, each a lunch in itself. Some 
places serve early bird dinners of lobster for $7.95. 
</P>
<P>
And Bob, at the lunch counter of the Bar Harbor airport, is happy to serve his 
specialty anytime, the Mac a la Maine: macaroni and cheese with diced clams and 
a can of tuna, all stirred together and baked. Bob claims that people come from 
miles around for a plate, but our plane departure denied us this culinary 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: The West Street Cafe (across from the wharf) is a family place 
that draws many locals. It serves early bird lobster for $7.95, a pair for 
$12.95. It also has a two-for-one special of shrimp, haddock or mussels for 
$11.95 anytime: Pay for one and get two. The menu is loaded with seafood, plus 
steaks, chops and chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Fisherman's Landing (on the wharf) takes orders at a stand-up counter. When you 
get it, you can go to picnic tables on the wharf. This is a good spot for 
lobster or crab rolls at $5.25 and $3.75. It also ladles out steamed clams and 
heaping plates of shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The Rinehart Dining Pavilion, a pretty room at Wonder View Motor Lodge, is a 
separate building at the crest of the hill with beautiful views of the harbor 
and town. It's open for all meals, and the emphasis is fresh seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: The Bar Harbor Inn (Newport Drive; $130 double, an average 
for high season) sits on eight acres of wooded land on a promontory overlooking 
Frenchman Bay. You have three options: the beautiful main inn, very traditional 
in style; an oceanfront lodge, also traditional, and standard motel units in 
yet another building. Prices melt down from main inn to motel. 
</P>
<P>
The inn offers a feeling of quiet elegance, with pastel colors, classic 
furniture, fireplace, grandfather clock and plants. Inn bedrooms have a mix of 
antiques and handsome reproduction; some have four-posters. Dine in the Reading 
Room restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Boats leave regularly from the wharf for deep-sea fishing. Boats 
also sail along the coast after haddock, cod and flounder. Three- and 
two-masted schooners and smaller sloops will take you on a cruise around the 
bay, which is the best vantage point for seeing some of the old shoreline 
estates. 
</P>
<P>
For a different experience take an early morning drive to the peak of Acadia's 
Cadillac Mountain, highest on the eastern seaboard (1,530 feet). Take a 
horse-carriage ride along paths donated by John D. Rockefeller Jr. between 1915 
and 1933. The 50 miles of pathways follow ground contours. Also, you can hike, 
bike or ride horses. 
</P>

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city, which was incorporated as the 28th city in Orange County on Jan. 1, 
encompasses some of the state's most valuable and beautiful beach front. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sweeping north to take in the Pacific shore section of Laguna 
Niguel, boundaries of the 7-week-old city extend south to include the 
ocean-front enclave of Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
New lodgings, parks and other attractions have changed the look of Dana Point. 
More enticements for visitors are on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Soon to break ground is a $300- to $400-million hotel and recreation complex, 
the Monarch Beach Resort, by Hawaii's mega-resort developer Chris Hemmeter. 
</P>
<P>
sh Festival of Whales 
</P>
<P>
The next three weekends include the 17th annual Festival of the Whales at Dana 
Point Harbor. Entertainment and such marine activities as whale-watch cruises 
are scheduled on Saturdays and Sundays from Saturday through March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Get there from Los Angeles by driving south on Interstate 5 to the Pacific 
Coast Highway/California 1 off-ramp that curves back north. At the second 
stoplight, turn left on Dana Point Harbor Drive to the boat basin. 
</P>
<P>
For a hilltop view of nearly 2,500 yachts and sailboats tied up in the harbor, 
drive right at the first street, Park Lantern, which climbs quickly to the new 
Lantern Bay Park. Its inviting lawn also attracts kite flyers, Frisbee tossers 
and picnickers. 
</P>
<P>
The short street also leads to the 17-month-old Dana Point Resort, noted for 
its Cape Cod-style architecture. In addition to ocean views from most of its 
350 rooms, the hotel features three tennis courts and a health club.

Champagne brunch is on Sunday (11 a.m. to 3 p.m) in the resort's restaurant, 
Watercolors. Open daily for meals. For reservations, call toll-free (800) 
533-9748 or (714) 661-5000. 
</P>
<P>
Room rates begin at $160, but through April 9 Dana Point Resort has a "Whale of 
a Time" package that costs $134 per couple for a one-night stay, two breakfasts 
and whale-watching tickets. 
</P>
<P>
A left turn at Park Lantern leads into a popular coastal campground and picnic 
spot, Doheny Beach State Park. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two of the 120 campsites are on the ocean front; reserve through Mistix 
($12 a night, no hookups). Day-use entry for picnicking, fishing or surfing 
costs $4 per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the harbor drive, turn left at Golden Lantern to reach 
restaurants and shops at the edge of the marina and the departure piers for 
whale-watch cruises aboard vessels of Dana Wharf Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Observation boats leave the harbor for 90-minute outings at 10 a.m., noon and 2 
p.m. every day. On weekends there are extra trips at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., except 
during the whale festival when tours depart every hour. Tickets cost $10; 
children under 12 and senior citizens are $6. Call (714) 496-5794. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Parachute Launch 
</P>
<P>
Parasailing is the new sport at Dana Point Harbor. An innovative launch system 
lets riders take off (and land) from the tow boat so fliers don't get wet. 
</P>
<P>
Children under 100 pounds can take a tandem ride. For eight minutes the cost is 
$38 per person. Call (714) 831-1850. 
</P>
<P>
Another left turn from the harbor drive onto Island Way bridges the boat basin 
to the breakwater, where Dana Drive parallels the main channel. Look for the 
statue of Richard Henry Dana, the seagoing author of "Two Years Before the 
Mast" who is the new city's namesake. 
</P>
<P>
Anchoring either end of Dana Drive are two restaurants with harbor views: 
Delaney's, which specializes in seafood, and Reuben's that is also Michael's 
Supper Club. On a bluff beyond the boat-turning basin are Cannons and the Chart 
House, two other restaurants that view the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
At the far end of Dana Point Harbor Drive, visitors are welcome at Orange 
County Marine Institute, soon to be enlarged and renamed the Marine Institute 
at Dana Point Harbor. Sea creatures are on exhibit, along with a replica of 
Dana's sailing ship, the Pilgrim. 
</P>
<P>
Tours of the 1830s-era square-rigger that's anchored in the harbor will be 
offered Feb. 26 and March 5 during the Festival of the Whales. Special lectures 
and whale-watch tours are planned by the institute early on festival Saturdays; 
call (714) 496-2744 for information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Maritime Museum 
</P>
<P>
An occasional visitor to the harbor is the state's official tall ship, the 
Californian, owned and operated by the Nautical Heritage Society. Its 
headquarters is a small but fascinating maritime museum at 24532 Del Prado. 
</P>
<P>
Drive up the steep road at the end of the harbor, turn right on Green Lantern, 
then right on Pacific Coast Highway (which becomes one way) and look for a 
lighthouse-like building. Inside are high-seas memorabilia from the 1800s and 
models of historic sailing ships. Open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. except Sundays and 
Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
A left turn on Coast Highway takes you north to Ritz-Carlton Drive and the 
Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel. From the resort's 150-foot-high site on the cliffs 
above the Pacific, people can keep an eye out for migrating gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms at the Ritz, the only hotel in Southern California awarded Mobil's five 
stars and the Automobile Assn.'s five diamonds, begin at $185 a night and rise 
to $2,000 for the Presidential Suite. For reservations, call toll-free (800) 
241-3333 or (714) 240-2000. 
</P>
<P>
Other lodgings include the Marina Inn at the harbor and the Capistrano Bay Inn 
and Edgewater Inn across Coast Highway at Capistrano Beach. Call the Dana Point 
Chamber of Commerce for a list of accommodations and restaurants -- (714) 
496-1555. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Dana Point is 104 miles.

TO EXPLORE EDINBURGH, PLAN TO HIKE UP, DOWN

EDINBURGH, Scotland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We were huffing and puffing our way up one of Edinburgh's streets when somebody 
summed up the Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
"This place isn't on the level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. The place is all hills, so ingeniously designed that only the 
Royal Mile seems to go downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Every time we reached the top we would pause for breath, look around and find 
yet another winding street, its stone steps leading up to another undiscovered 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Old Town is really only one hill, a slope of volcanic rock that broods like a 
Sphinx over the Scottish plain, with Edinburgh Castle at its head and the 
Palace of Holyrood House at its tail. 
</P>
<P>
Countless alleys and wyndes spill down its flanks. Stone stairways descend to 
hidden pubs and tearooms. Sun-splashed courtyards gleam at the bottom of dank 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
From the castle ramparts other hills loom into view. To the west, behind 
Holyrood House, are Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat, with Firth of Forth in 
the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing Arthur's Seat to the northwest is Calton Hill, topped by strange 
monoliths and colonnades. To the north is the hill of Inverlieth, home of the 
Royal Botanic Garden. And to the south is Blackford Hill, site of the Royal 
Observatory and gateway to the Borders beyond. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Touring Old Town 
</P>
<P>
A tour of Old Town begins at the castle, which is easily reached by climbing 
one of the winding trails from Princes Street Gardens or by marching directly 
up High Street. 
</P>
<P>
Try to arrive for the firing of the 1 o'clock gun. Why a 1 o'clock gun? "We 
Scots are very frugal," the guide says. "A noonday gun would cost us 12 shots a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Once in the castle you'll find that the climb isn't over. The path winds 
farther up, through seven gates, until it reaches the oldest part of the 
castle. 
</P>
<P>
Crown Square, the heart of the castle complex, is flanked by the National War 
Memorial, the Crown Room, Queen Mary's Apartments, the Banqueting Hall and the 
United Services Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Here are memorials to Scottish regiments and soldiers who have died in various 
wars. Here too is the tiny alcove where in 1566 Mary gave birth to James VI, 
later to become James I of England. 
</P>
<P>
The Banqueting Hall, with beamed and vaulted ceiling, was long the setting for 
state banquets, not all of which were cakes and ale and merriment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Black Dinner of 1440 
</P>
<P>
Consider the Black Dinner of 1440. The evening's entree was a black bull's head 
-- the sign of death -- a signal for the young Earl of Douglas to be slain with 
axes in the presence of the king. 
</P>
<P>
(Dining in Edinburgh has always been an iffy proposition. At Holyrood House you 
can visit the room where Mary Queen of Scots' secretary, David Rizzio, was 
slaughtered while supping with the queen.) 
</P>
<P>
Just after leaving the castle esplanade, look at the house on the right. This 
is Cannonball House. The cannonball, which lodged near an upper window, was 
lobbed from the castle in 1745 and was intended for Bonnie Prince Charlie at 
Holyrood House. It fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Now you are on the Royal Mile, named for the procession of royals who trod its 
stones in their passages between the castle and Holyrood House. 
</P>
<P>
On the right is Boswell's Court, named for the Edinburgh lawyer and biographer 
of Dr. Samuel Johnson. It houses the Witchery, a good restaurant for lunch or 
tea, though your digestion may be hindered by remembering that this is the site 
of the infamous Hell-Fire Club, whose cabalistic emblems adorn the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Order the haggis we' neeps 'n' tatties. Neeps are turnips, tatties are 
potatoes, and haggis is a sheep's stomach stuffed with innards and oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brodie the Burglar 
</P>
<P>
Below, the alleys branching off are Mylne's Court, Riddle's Close, Macmorran's 
Close and James's Court, all named for upstanding Scots citizens. When you 
reach Brodie's Close, however, you encounter a different sort of character. 
</P>
<P>
Brodie's Close is named for Deacon William Brodie, a town councilor and cabinet 
maker by day and a cat burglar by night. 
</P>
<P>
On March 5, 1788, he was arrested while robbing the excise office, and later 
hanged on a gallows he had designed. Ironically, his design failed him, and it 
took three "drops" for Brodie to die. 
</P>
<P>
Brodie survives in three ways. First, there is Brodie's Close. Second, across 
the way, is Deacon Brodie's Tavern, a popular spot. And third, he became the 
model for Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." 
</P>
<P>
Across from Deacon Brodie's Tavern is a brass H set in the pavement, where the 
gallows once stood and where the last public execution was held in 1829. 
</P>
<P>
The guest of honor was William Burke, the body-snatcher who gave us the verb 
burke: "to murder a person in such a way as to produce no incriminating marks, 
usually by suffocation, and with the intention of selling the body for 
dissection." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cobblestone Heart 
</P>
<P>
Down the street in front of St. Giles Cathedral is a cobblestone heart marking 
the entrance to the Old Tolbooth, the town prison that was demolished in 1817 
and immortalized by Sir Walter Scott in his novel "The Heart of Midlothian." 
Scott salvaged its great wooden door for display at his house at Abbotsford. 
</P>
<P>
An early custom persists here. Prisoners released from the jail would spit on 
the door to ensure that they'd never return. Today even brisk women executives, 
clicking along with Gucci bags on their shoulders, spit on the cobbled heart as 
they pass. 
</P>
<P>
Don't stick to High Street, though. The closes (closed alleys) and wyndes 
(through alleys) seem forbidding at first, but pluck up your courage and enter. 
</P>
<P>
A plaque in the entryway to James's Court says it was once the residence of 
philosopher David Hume, who entertained Boswell and Johnson in his lodgings. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the alley is a bagpipe shop where you can buy pipes and songbooks 
and take lessons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Europe's First High-Rises 
</P>
<P>
Here the alley opens into a courtyard with apartment buildings on four sides. 
These tenements give a fair picture of what Edinburgh has always been like. 
</P>
<P>
Built on slopes and confined by city walls, Edinburgh grew up rather than out, 
creating Europe's first high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
So quickly does the slope drop off that a building five stories high on the 
hillside may be 10 stories high at the back. 
</P>
<P>
Within James's Court are a pub and restaurant, with outdoor tables protected 
from High Street's traffic. Here too is Lady Stair's House (1622), restored as 
a museum to Scotland's three literary greats, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott 
and Robert Louis Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
Along with more conventional memorabilia the museum houses some homely touches, 
such as a lock of Burns' hair and the rocking horse Scott rode as a child. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Lady Stair's House steep steps descend to The Mound at the outer edge 
of the Old Town. Suddenly you are no longer confined by walls and alleys. In 
front of you is the panorama of Princes Street Gardens, with the geometric 
pattern of the New Town beyond. 
</P>
<P>
To regain Royal Mile, simply turn right and follow The Mound up to its 
intersection with High Street. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the bottom of Royal Mile, as High Street becomes Canongate, the slope 
levels off, ending at the broad plain of Holyrood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Royal Residence 
</P>
<P>
Holyrood is a royal residence, but when the queen and her family are not there 
(most of the time) it is open to visitors who can view the rooms and also some 
older apartments that resonate with the history of the House of Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
There are tiny Historic Apartments, scene of Mary Queen of Scots' stormy 
interview with John Knox in 1561. Beyond (and up the winding stairs) is the 
tiny dining room where Rizzio was murdered in 1566. The ever-precise Scots aver 
that his stab wounds numbered 56 -- no more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
Here too is the long picture gallery containing portraits of 89 Scottish kings, 
commissioned by Charles II and executed by Jacob de Wet in a burst of 
creativity and efficiency. Look closely: Though the kings' costumes differ, 
their faces are all the same. 
</P>
<P>
Trekking from the castle to Holyrood House and exploring all the hidden alleys 
in between is plenty for one day. On another day, walk up Arthur's Seat, behind 
Holyrood Park, and see from its summit how insignificant Castle Hill really is. 
From Arthur's Seat it seems a mere bump in the earth. 
</P>
<P>
Ascend the narrow path that hugs the face of Salisbury Crag, viewing the Old 
Town in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
Descend again to Holyrood Park and walk away from town, passing the swans in 
St. Margaret's Loch, until you reach a cairn at the entrance to the park. 
</P>
<P>
The cairn marks the spot where Nicol Muschet murdered his wife on the night of 
Oct. 17, 1720. No plaque explains the story; the Scots don't trumpet their 
bloody history. 
</P>
<P>
As with the brass H where the gallows stood and the cobbled "Heart of 
Midlothian," you must discover the gory details for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilderness in Close 
</P>
<P>
From the Muschet cairn you can see the monuments of Calton Hill in the 
distance. Calton Hill rises in the center of town, but is charmingly wild. 
</P>
<P>
At the top is the National Monument, begun in 1822 as a complete reproduction 
of the Parthenon but falling far short. Only the front portico was completed 
before funds (and perhaps memories) ran dry. 
</P>
<P>
But the Nelson Memorial is complete and can be climbed (by now you've realized 
that climbing is the order of the day), rewarding you with grand views of 
towers and steeples, the Firth of Forth and the Kingdom of Fife across the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Blackford Hill (to the south) and Inverlieth Hill (to the north) complete the 
circuit of Edinburgh's hills. From Blackford Hill you see the grand sweep of 
Edinburgh: a view of Old Town sloping down from Castle Hill, with the 
unforested heights of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags looming above. 
</P>
<P>
On Inverlieth Hill you'll spend more time enjoying the Royal Botanic Garden 
than gazing at the distant views. But look up now and then: There is Old Town, 
brooding in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
The Scots say that Edinburgh is built on seven hills, like Rome. I counted only 
six, but that was plenty for one week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Four big Victorian establishments dominate the Edinburgh hotel scene. All 
prices are per person per night, for room and breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
The Caledonian Hotel (Princes Street, Edinburgh EH1 2AB, $60 to $90 U.S.) 
anchors the west end of Princes Street, while the North British Hotel (Princes 
Street, Edinburgh EH2 2EQ, $60-$90) holds down the east end. The Old Waverley 
Hotel (43 Princes St., Edinburgh EH2 2BY, $45-$60) is in between. Across North 
Bridge from the North British Hotel and handier to the Old Town is the Carlton 
Highland Hotel (North Bridge, Edinburgh EH1 1SD, $60-$90). 
</P>
<P>
Edinburgh swarms with small guest houses and inns, with prices starting as low 
as $15 a night. A list can be obtained from the British Tourist Authority, 350 
S. Figueroa St., Suite 450, Los Angeles, 90071, phone (213) 628-3525. 
</P>
<P>
If you arrive in Edinburgh without a reservation, the Tourist Information 
Center at Waverley Market, next to the train station, will book a room for you. 
When the Edinburgh Festival is on (the last three weeks of August), it's best 
to book in advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Pompadour in the Caledonian Hotel is arguably the best restaurant in town, 
with formal French service available nightly at about $30 per person. Smaller 
is the Witchery (Castle Hill, Royal Mile), which serves excellent Scotch beef 
and salmon (about $15 per person) in a spooky subterranean setting. 
</P>
<P>
At the Gilded Balloon (Cowgate) you can dine on lamb chops and cockaleekie soup 
under a cavernous vaulted ceiling ($15). 
</P>
<P>
The Doric Tavern (upstairs at 15 Market St.) features daily specials, a huge 
selection of wine by the glass and an arty crowd ($10-$15).

MONKEYS OF GIBRALTAR

GIBRALTAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rock is a legend. 
</P>
<P>
Tarry a few hours or a few days and you will get a royal greeting from what may 
be the world's most unusual reception. A committee of golden-brown macaque 
monkeys, which are known as the "apes of Gibraltar." 
</P>
<P>
As the only simians still roaming wild in Europe, Gibraltar's beloved mascots 
live among the gun emplacements in two separate packs on top of the windy 
limestone heights of the Rock (altitude: 1,400 feet). 
</P>
<P>
Friendly and playful by nature, the no-tail monkeys love tourists. Visitors 
feed them chocolates, candies, nuts, fruits and ice cream cones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pose for Camera 
</P>
<P>
For half of a banana, you will always find one furry animal who'll give you a 
handshake or pose for camera shots. 
</P>
<P>
The monkeys are such big hits that one New York City tourist has been sending 
them packages of peanuts for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Several universities have dispatched research teams to Gibraltar to find out 
more about the monkeys, a type of social animal that lives in family and 
community units. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing about 60 pounds at maturity, most of them live to 15 years. Also, no 
scientist has yet been able to find out what happens to a dead monkey, since no 
one has ever found a body or a skeleton in the 1,000 years of monkey life on 
the Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Numbering about 40, the monkeys can be reached by cable car up the west slope, 
a rather scary ride that nevertheless offers a stunning panorama of the bay and 
the Spanish town of Algeciras. 
</P>
<P>
If you wait until 4 p.m., the animals will come down from their heights to a 
lower perch (reachable by taxi) for their daily feeding (provided by the 
British Army with an allowance of 15 pence per head per day). 
</P>
<P>
They are fed the usual ration of bananas (which contain hidden vitamin pills), 
oatmeal, sweet potatoes and green vegetables. This supplements the wild 
berries, roots, seeds and insects that the monkeys eat on their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Manners Are Bad 
</P>
<P>
However, the monkeys -- supposedly pals of humans -- are easily upset by quick 
movements or sudden noises. 
</P>
<P>
They also have bad manners. If they see something they want, they'll grab it. 
Just ask somebody who has tried to feed them peanuts one at a time only to have 
the bag rudely snatched away. 
</P>
<P>
There was one monkey, a female, who stole mirrors and took them to her lair, 
where she spent time admiring herself before smashing them to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of the tourist season, when about 300,000 people visit, the 
monkeys also have been known to filch a purse or two and to run off with a 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
But don't strike back. Anyone who molests a Gibraltar monkey faces a prison 
term or a fine, for the Macaca sylvana species enjoys the protection of the 
British government through a special keeper, a sergeant-at-arms whose 
responsibility it is to see that they are nurtured and kept in good health. 
</P>
<P>
This latter responsibility includes giving the monkeys whiskey when they catch 
colds -- a most delicate maneuver since the frolicsome animals can't be 
corraled so easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Churchill Paid Visit 
</P>
<P>
Even Winston Churchill, though beset in 1944 with crises on all fronts, engaged 
in some important monkey business at the Rock. 
</P>
<P>
While on his way to the Tehran Conference, Winnie stopped at the bastion (2 1/4 
square miles in area) to see how the frisky quadrupeds were getting along. 
</P>
<P>
Shocked to hear that their numbers had dwindled to under 10, he let it be known 
that the survival of the apes of Gibraltar was a matter of concern to the Prime 
Minister and that their number thereafter was to be kept above 24. 
</P>
<P>
There's a saying among Gibraltar's 30,000 inhabitants (most of whom are British 
subjects), that if the monkeys ever disappear, then the British will also go 
away. Thus, whenever a baby simian is born, the army records the birth with a 
flourish befitting the glory of the British Empire. 
</P>
<P>
The Barbary monkey is so held in esteem by British officialdom that when the 
first decimal coin -- in the denomination of 25 new pence -- was put out in 
1971, it contained a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and Gibraltar's monkey on 
the reverse side. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Many cruise lines stop at Gibraltar as a port of call. British Airways has 
flights from London (it takes about two hours). From Madrid there is a weekly 
flight on British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
The expensive Rock Hotel has 160 rooms, with balconies that overlook the sea, 
most with private bath. The Caleta Palace Hotel, with 200 rooms, stands on a 
cliff overhanging the village of Catalan Bay. Also expensive. The Montarik 
Hotel (87 rooms) has a sun terrace with a fine view of sea and sunsets and is 
less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
As for restaurants, La Bayuca, Spanish specialties; Winston's, English fare, 
and the Mermaid, seafood, are excellent, though pricey.

Cockroaches in her teacups, cobwebs on her couch: 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old blind woman, who resides alone in Ontario except for her pet 
birds, didn't know she was living in such squalor. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't know that the government could help, until neighbors alerted a 
social service agency, which notified the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out immediately to inspect," said Piera Amourgi, Ontario community 
development coordinator, "but our inspector couldn't go past the first room 
because there were insects everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The city put the woman up in a motel for a few days while the house was 
fumigated and cleaned. Then it was repaired, recarpeted and painted, inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
The cost was about $15,000, which the woman may never need to repay, thanks to 
a $2,000-emergency grant for cleaning, and a deferred loan to be paid whenever 
the title to her house changes hands. For many seniors, where this type of 
deferred loan is available, this comes when they die.

'Try to Reach Out' 
</P>
<P>
The Ontario woman was a beneficiary of a federal program, administered by 
cities, for low-income people. It is an old program, but some of the ways it is 
being used are fairly new and not widely known. 
</P>
<P>
"People who really need the help might not even know about it, though we really 
try to reach out to the community," Amourgi said. 
</P>
<P>
Funding comes through Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 
1974, which for years primarily provided low-income housing and public works 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the act has been more broadly interpreted to encompass other 
activities, such as home improvement, fair housing, graffiti removal and even 
finding roommates for seniors. "It's kind of like a computer dating game, 
trying to match people," Amourgi said. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy C. Steinhaus, deputy community economic development director for 
Ontario, said, "It has been more flexible recently about how we can use the 
(community development block grant or CDBG) funds, but basically, it's people 
who are low income who get the benefits." "Low income" is determined by a 
formula issued by HUD, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
and it varies slightly from county to county. 
</P>
<P>
How each city distributes CDBG funds and how much each jurisdiction gets also 
varies, though all people who get home-improvement funds must be property 
owners, not renters. (There is another federal rehab loan program, also handled 
by some city governments, for landlords who have low-income renters.) 
</P>
<P>
Ontario gets about $1.1 million in CDBG funds each year, with an estimated 60% 
going into housing, but Fountain Valley only gets about $300,000 a year, though 
it spends about the same percentage for deferred loans and other housing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Word of Mouth 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley has one CDBG program for homeowners who want to fix up and 
paint their homes in which the city rebates 40% of the cost, up to $1,000, if 
the applicant qualifies under low- and moderate-income guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest number of requests for this (program) has come from seniors 
living in two mobile-home parks in the city," said Joan Dean of the Fountain 
Valley Community Development Department. "That's because of word of mouth. 
Other people aren't as much aware of our programs." The city also offers 
CDBG-subsidized emergency grants and low-interest loans for up to $20,000 for 
15 to 20 years, for major plumbing, roof or structural repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Like Fountain Valley and Ontario, Pomona also offers a deferred loan for 
housing rehabs, using CDBG funds, "but essentially, our loan is only deferred 
for a couple of years," said Duane Solomon, city housing coordinator, "because 
what happens if Grandma quitclaims her house to her grandson, but the deed 
isn't recorded until Grandma dies? How do we track that?" 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the city loaned owners of six commercial buildings a total of 
about $600,000 for facade improvements, and these loans will be forgiven after 
20 years, Solomon said, because they are used as part of a slum-prevention 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona also uses its CDBG funds for its "move-on" program, in which old houses 
are moved from commercial to residential neighborhoods and are then 
refurbished. So far, two houses under this program have been purchased by the 
same private party, one house for $1, the other for what it would have cost to 
demolish it: $2,250. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Old Houses Emphasized 
</P>
<P>
Solomon says he notifies as many as 40 to 50 potential bidders every time an 
old house is offered at such low prices, but there has been little response. "I 
don't know why, whether it's want of interest, too burdensome because they are 
such small projects, or if there are just too many other demands," he said. 
"Some people want these houses for free." 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis in Pomona is on old houses, because its housing stock is older 
than that of many cities. In Newport Beach, the focus has been on new 
construction, and that city hasn't offered any deferred loans, "because we just 
haven't had much demand," said Craig Bluell of the city's Community Development 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a need for low-income housing in Newport Beach, however, and the 
city has responded by providing private developers with grants or seed money 
through CDBG funds to construct about 145 units in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've also granted density bonuses so developers could build higher densities 
than would normally be allowed," Bluell added. 
</P>

OLD HOTEL TO BEGIN A NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN De WOLFE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Los Angeles' "newest downtown hotel" opened in December of 1927, it was 
hailed as "another Mayflower landing." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-story, steel-reinforced Class-A Mayflower Hotel was described as 
overlooking the "verdantly green Library Park with its new $3-million library 
building" at Grand Avenue and 5th Street and as having a choice location across 
from the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the landmark structure at 535 S. Grand Avenue, built by William H. 
Anderson and originally operated by Charles De Long on property leased for 99 
years, has been extensively renovated and will reopen in mid-March as the new 
Checkers Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Checkers is a joint development of Ayala Hotels Inc., a division of Ayala 
International of Hong Kong, headed by William F. Wilkinson, and Treptow 
Development Co., a Houston-based diversified real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Charles F. Whittlesey, who designed the original building, had a challenge in 
terms of light and air courts in working out something worthwhile on a lot that 
was only 60 feet wide and 160 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
On the exterior, the structure retains its "Spanish Moorish design" with 
cornices, stylized gargoyles done in sandstone and two carved ships, embedded 
on the sides of the main entrance, depicting the Mayflower which brought the 
Pilgrims in 1620, and Columbus' Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
The structure originally had 348 rooms (now reduced to 190 suites), each with a 
private bath; room rates ranged from $2.50 to a whopping $7.50 a night. In the 
1950s, it was part of the Hilton hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Mayflower later was owned and operated by William and Monte Mallet until it 
closed in 1985. The building was sold and its gradual transformation into the 
European-style luxury Checkers Hotel was started. 
</P>
<P>
More than $49 million and four years of work have been spent on the hotel 
building. The interior has been completely changed. Two floors were added on 
top of the building to house the physical plant, as well as a health spa for 
hotel guests, in addition to a Checkers Restaurant and adjacent Checkers Bar 
off the main lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The guest rooms have been enlarged and turned into luxury accommodations that 
range from one- or two-bedroom suites with marble bathrooms, to two luxury 
penthouses, each with fireplace, living room, bedroom and dining area. 
</P>
<P>
A library/lounge and four board rooms on the mezzanine are available for 
business meetings or private dining. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel has a concierge as well as 24-hour room, maid and valet service, and 
its room rates are $190 for suites to $850 and $975 for the penthouse units. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility will be operated by Ayala Hotels Inc., of which William F. 
Wilkinson is president. Ayala also operates Campton Place Hotel off Union 
Square in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Charlene Nagel, former general manager of the Santa Barbara Biltmore, was 
appointed general manager for the Checkers Hotel, and Patrick C. Willis, 
previously with Hyatt Hotels and more recently corporate food and beverage 
director for Rosewood Hotels, is the hotel manager. 
</P>
<P>
Holtsmark Architects of San Francisco is the project architect and 
Kaplan/McLaughlin/Diaz of Los Angeles is associated architect. The latter has 
been involved in the restoration of 13 buildings on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
Prime contractor is Nishimatsu Construction and the general contractor is 
Linbeck Construction Corp.

CORONA, WITH INDUSTRY INFLUX, FAVORS GROWTH RIVERSIDE COUNTY CITY BUCKS RECENT 
TREND OF COMMUNITIES SEEKING SLOWER GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. KINCHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There must be a time warp hanging over the city of Corona in Riverside County: 
In an era of slow-growth sentiments, the city of 52,000 is actively seeking 
residential, industrial and commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
Development investment in the city near where Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties meet totaled $433 million last year, up 46% from the $296 
million permit valuation of 1987, according to George Guayante, head of the 
city's economic development program. 
</P>
<P>
"While many other cities are wrapped up in slow-growth movements, Corona is 
actively seeking new companies to invest in the community," he said. "We want 
industrial and commercial development, of course, but -- with Corona's 
population expected to grow to 80,000 by the end of the century, plans are 
under way to build about 12,000 new houses and several new apartment 
complexes." 
</P>
<P>
Guayante said that much of the $137-million increase in building valuations can 
be attributed to Corona's aggressive efforts to bring new retail and industrial 
business to the Inland Empire community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buildable Land 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on the retail and industrial sectors is understandable: About 
2,800 acres, almost 75% of Corona's inventory of buildable land, is zoned for 
industrial use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers invested an estimated $37 million to build nearly 2.3 million square 
feet of space for manufacturing and distribution centers and warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
Among the firms that decided to capitalize on Corona's affordable land prices 
and strategic industrial location on the Riverside (91) Freeway and Corona (71) 
Expressway, midway between downtown Riverside and northern Orange County was 
King Bearing Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The power transmission products distribution concern chose Corona as the site 
of its more than 200,000-square-foot warehouse and office complex to 
consolidate its six California facilities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industrial Companies 
</P>
<P>
Bergen Brunswig Corp., an Orange-based pharmaceutical concern, has just 
announced plans to close warehouses in Anaheim and Buena Park and move next 
year to a 231,000-square-foot facility in Corona. About 125 employees will be 
transferred, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Another company that will move to Corona is Marshall Aluminum Products Inc., a 
well-known Southland manufacturer of aluminum windows, patio doors and mirrors. 
The firm's 85,000-square-foot factory is expected to be ready next month in the 
Corona Spectrum, a 92-acre complex. 
</P>
<P>
Other major industrial projects under way include the 78-acre Pacesetter 
Business Center, the 70-acre International Business Park and the 56-acre 
Parkview Business Center. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial activity in 1988 added up to a $22-million investment that produced 
2.4 million square feet of commercial space. This investment paid off, Guayante 
said, with overall per capita sales at least 36% higher in Corona compared to 
other Riverside County cities and the state as a whole, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new entries in Corona's retail lineup are a 105,000-square-foot Price 
Club store in Corona Hills Plaza; a new Crevier Motors Hyundai dealership in 
the 27-acre Corona Auto Mall and the relocation of the Roger Diller Chevrolet 
Corona dealership to the same auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
Additional sales tax revenue will be returned to the city from tenants in seven 
new planned retail centers, including the 500,000-square-foot Corona Hills 
Plaza; the 145,000-square-foot Corona West Center and five neighborhood centers 
ranging in size from 100,000 to 200,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Among the builders developing residential projects -- largely in southern or 
eastern parts of the city are: Presley of Southern California, Promenade, in 
the eastern part of the city next to Riverside; Buie Corp., Corona Ranch, with 
single-family, attached, townhouses, condominiums and estate lots; W.S.L.A., 
Sierra Del Oro, single-family, attached, condominiums and estates and Foothill 
Ranch, South Corona, single-family and attached units.

REAGANS' PRIMARY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ruth Ryon's column (Jan. 29) raised the question whether the White House or the 
Santa Barbara estate would be considered the Reagans' primary residence 
eligible for certain tax advantages (i.e. rollover of the gain). Richard Nixon 
fought the same battle and lost to the IRS. Nixon tried to argue that his San 
Clemente estate was his primary residence, but the IRS correctly held that 
during his years in office the White House was his primary residence, and 
therefore any gain on other properties was subject to tax currently.

FACTORY HOME PRODUCTION IN STATE 12,003 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's manufactured-home industry sold 12,003 homes last year of which 
10,457 were sited in the state, with the remainder exported to other states, 
according to the California Manufactured Housing Institute. 
</P>
<P>
The institute said more than 1 million Californians live in more than 540,000 
manufactured houses. The cost of the average manufactured house sold during 
1988 was $37,230, excluding the cost of the land, according to Tony Hadley, 
spokesman for the institute. 
</P>
<P>
Hadley said construction cost for a manufactured house averaged $30.99 per 
square foot compared to $43.40 a square foot for a comparable site-constructed 
house.

TAKING TURNS IN CLASS;

<P>
HALF A JOB IS PERFECT ASSIGNMENT FOR TEACHERS WILLING TO SHARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Gregg, who is 5, runs up to his kindergarten teacher with a question. "Mrs. 
Carley," he says, then quickly corrects himself, "I mean, Mrs. Snyder." 
</P>
<P>
Gregg's momentary confusion is understandable. On Mondays, Tuesdays and 
alternate Wednesdays, Gregg's teacher at Madison Elementary School in Lakewood 
is Shiela Carley. On Thursdays, Fridays and the remaining Wednesdays, Donna 
Snyder readies Gregg and his classmates for reading and cheers them on as they 
count and finger-paint. 
</P>
<P>
Carley and Snyder share a desk, a classroom and a single job. While job sharing 
has not swept American schools, it appeals to a minority of teachers who can 
afford to trade part of a salary for more time to raise children, take college 
courses or ease into retirement. 
</P>
<P>
No figures are available on how many teachers job-share nationwide. Statewide 
statistics have not been updated since 1981 when a survey of California's 1,042 
school districts found that 37% had tried job sharing and that more than 1,500 
California teachers were sharing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to Suzanne Smith, who conducted the 1981 survey, a recent informal 
canvass indicates that the number of districts that allow the practice has 
grown, although she does not know whether the number of job sharers has 
increased. (Smith is co-founder and co-director of the nonprofit organization 
New Ways to Work in San Francisco.) Most of the job-sharing teachers are women 
with young children, although pairs have included men, married couples and even 
a mother-daughter team. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Long Beach Unified School District's 3,300 teachers, 34, including 
Carley and Snyder, share jobs. Los Angeles Unified School District has about 
200 job-sharers among its 33,000 teachers. The National Education Assn. gave 
the practice a boost by endorsing it in 1981. Many unions, including United 
Teachers-Los Angeles, which represents Los Angeles Unified teachers, support 
the concept of job sharing. 
</P>
<P>
Even without union pressure, most local school districts allow the practice, at 
the discretion of individual principals. Culver City Unified School District, 
for example, permits job sharing, although it has had no requests for several 
years. Beverly Hills Unified School District recently approved job sharing for 
an initial pair of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Job sharing increases a school district's paper work, but most administrators 
feel it is worth the price. Richard Marr, an official with the Montebello 
Unified School District, said job sharing, or tandem teaching, as the district 
calls it, "seems to have worked quite well." It is one way the district can 
retain good teachers who might otherwise leave the profession, he said. The 
district has five teams, most of them teaching mothers, among its 1,300 
teachers. "What we usually find," Marr said, "is that after their families 
mature they come back to full-time teaching." 
</P>
<P>
Carley and Snyder have shared their Lakewood classroom for three years. Both 
have toddlers at home and see the arrangement as a way to eliminate the guilty 
sense many working mothers have that they are not doing their best on either 
front. As Snyder said, "When I'm at work, I want to give 100% to my job, and 
when I'm with my family, I want to give 100% to them, and this allows me to do 
that." As a result of job sharing, Carley said, "I'm completing housework 
before 11 o'clock at night." 
</P>
<P>
Carley and Snyder, who were friends before they were partners, say their 
students have little or no trouble adjusting to two teachers instead of one. As 
they point out, many of the youngsters attended preschools where they had more 
than one teacher. And both teachers are in the classroom each day during the 
first week of school so the children get to know both of them at the beginning 
of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed in a schoolyard sandbox, several of the youngsters stopped playing 
long enough to say yes when asked if they liked having two teachers. Parent 
Joan Wagner, whose 6-year-old son, Scott, is in the class, said "it's nice for 
the children to have a change." Carley and Snyder's principal, James Churchill, 
is also pleased with the arrangement. Each of the pair gives more than 50% of 
her time and energy to the school, Churchill said. 
</P>
<P>
Compatibility and good communication are the keys to making the arrangement 
work, according to job-sharing teachers Jill Cooper and Mary Schachner. 
Schachner and Cooper have been teaching a combined first and second grade at 
Larch Avenue Elementary School in Lennox for six years. Both were pregnant when 
they proposed to their principal that they share the job. They were one of 
Lennox School District's three pioneering pairs. The district now has eight job 
sharers among its 200 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who is bilingual, teaches Spanish reading and other courses in the 
mornings, while Schachner, who teaches in English, takes over in the 
afternoons. To keep abreast of what is happening in class, the women often 
lunch together. "And we leave notes for each other on our desk," Schachner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carley and Snyder also leave messages on their mutual desk. They keep a single 
classroom log as well, noting which child can't seem to concentrate, who wet 
his or her pants, who is having trouble with the s sound and anything else that 
might affect student performance. They also call each other regularly, usually 
waiting until their own children are in bed. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the survey taker, said the most innovative mode of communication she 
found among job-sharing teachers involved a pair who lived close to each other 
but had a substantial commute to their school. After her shift, one teacher 
would tape-record her observations about the class. She then dropped the tape 
in her partner's mailbox so the partner could listen to it the next morning as 
she drove to school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband-Wife Team 
</P>
<P>
Communication was not a problem for former job-sharers Dian and Harold 
Stonbraker. The Stonbrakers were on the Artesia High School faculty when Dian 
became pregnant with their son, Sean, now 6. Both wanted to stay home with 
their first child. They arranged to share Dian's job, teaching home economics 
for a semester on alternate days (a substitute was hired to teach Harold's 
social studies classes). "When it was her day to work, I got up at night to 
feed Sean and change his diaper," he recalled. Some of Harold's fondest 
memories are of the hours he was able to spend caring for his newborn son, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
On rare occasions, Harold recalled, their shared students would try to divide 
and conquer the teaching pair -- with little success. "The kids would try to 
pull things. They would say, 'Mrs. Stonbraker said. . . .' They forgot I went 
home every day and saw Mrs. Stonbraker." 
</P>
<P>
The Stonbrakers are now back in separate classrooms at Artesia. The ABC Unified 
School District has three pairs among its 900 teachers, including teams who 
share library and physical education slots. 
</P>
<P>
Most job-sharers sign contracts that specify how they will divide the work and 
commit the survivor to taking over the class if one of them decides to drop 
out. Most districts split salary and benefits between the teachers on the basis 
of their division of classroom responsibility, although Palos Verdes Peninsula 
Unified School District pays full benefits to each of its 16 job-sharing 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Although most job-sharers say the arrangement has improved the quality of their 
lives, they cite other benefits as well. Snyder said she arrives at school on 
Wednesday or Thursday refreshed and eager to teach -- it is the beginning of 
the work week for her -- just when a teacher who is going it alone may be 
starting to flag. She and her partner are rarely sick, and when one is, the 
other substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Carley said the setup lessens the likelihood of burnout and helps her cope with 
the occasional "children who would wear you down if you had them for a week. I 
have a lot more tolerance and energy to give them." The pair also says the 
children benefit from having two people plan their academic program. "Because 
there are two of us, there's more going on," Carley said. "It's more exciting. 
There are more ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Schachner said dividing responsibilities has allowed her and partner Cooper to 
become specialists in the subjects they teach. "I think I've become a better 
teacher because I don't have to spread myself so thin." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carley sometimes misses a full paycheck, she notes that she saves on 
everything from commuting costs to a professional wardrobe. "I don't have to 
worry about wearing the same black skirt five days in a row," she said. More 
important, job sharing means she can do both the things she wants to do most: 
teach and be with her family. As fellow job-sharer Cooper said, she works at 
her teaching job more than half time "but I don't mind. It's the best of both 
worlds."

BAILOUT PLAN SEEN ERASING THIRD OF S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
CAPITAL REQUIREMENT EXPECTED TO CAUSE MASSIVE SHAKEOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's plan to bail out foundering savings and loan institutions will 
trigger a massive industry shakeout that will wipe out a third to a half of 
today's S&amp;Ls, a growing number of financial experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal has the immediate goal of liquidating about 350 insolvent 
thrift institutions and making good on federal insurance of deposits up to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, however, analysts expect more than 1,000 weak but currently afloat 
S&amp;Ls to disappear -- either swallowed by other thrifts, bank-holding 
companies and non-financial corporations or forced to shut down altogether. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only 2,000 May Remain 
</P>
<P>
The savings industry, destined to become not much more than a carbon copy of 
the banking business, may be left with 2,000 S&amp;Ls or even fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Allan Meltzer of Carnegie-Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh, Pa., 
compares the S&amp;L situation today to a typical freshman class at college. 
"Look to the right of you, look to the left of you," Meltzer tells his 
students. "One of the three of you will not survive." 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for this massive consolidation of the highly fragmented U.S. 
lending business will go to a key provision of the Bush proposal -- a 
requirement that S&amp;Ls maintain capital reserves roughly equal to at least 
6% of their assets by mid-1991, compared to only 3% now. 
</P>
<P>
Banks also will be required to meet the new test, which, ultimately, will force 
all financial institutions to hold a minimum of 8% of their assets in readily 
available sources of cash, such as equity, preferred stock and retained 
earnings, to cover potential losses from bad loans. The uniform standards are 
supposed to be fully in place by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
For most Americans, the change might mean a shift to a different institution 
for saving and borrowing. But there still should be plenty of available sources 
for home mortgages and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits for Home Loans 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, home loans will enjoy a special benefit under the new risk-based 
capital requirements, because banks and thrifts will need to hold only half as 
much capital to back mortgages on homes and apartments of up to four units as 
they will for most other loans. 
</P>
<P>
But for many home builders and real estate developers, the new rules could 
spell the end of the cozy relationship that they have built over the years with 
local thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration insists that requiring the thrifts to roughly double 
their own capital is the minimum necessary to prevent another collapse of the 
industry in the future. Unless they are forced to put more of their own capital 
at risk, Administration officials point out, federally insured S&amp;Ls will 
have no reason to curb dangerous lending practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Imposing the higher capital standard is the only way we can avoid sowing the 
seeds for another disaster," agrees Robert Litan, a banking industry analyst at 
the Brookings Institution. "This is the key to making the plan work." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal for raising the capital requirement for S&amp;Ls may not emerge 
from Congress intact. But whatever compromise he reaches with Congress almost 
surely will include provisions designed to force the thrift industry to shore 
itself up and prevent a repeat of the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great scandals is the weak capitalization of the thrift industry," 
says Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, a senior Republican on the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Up in Arms 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists for the once-politically sacrosanct thrift industry are up in arms 
over the Bush Administration's unspoken plans to put hundreds of weak savings 
institutions out of business. "They will fight this to the death," says Kenneth 
Guenther, head of the Independent Bankers Assn. of America, which represents 
small banks. 
</P>
<P>
Death it may be. Lawmakers, once beholden to the thrift industry because of its 
widespread local political clout and its mountains of campaign contributions, 
are starting to demonstrate much greater independence. The electoral defeat 
last November of former House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain 
(D-R.I.) removed a major obstacle to reform. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the thrift industry, the White House has indicated that it 
might be willing to make the capital requirements temporarily easier to meet. 
Nonetheless, whatever new rules emerge are expected to touch off nothing less 
than a Darwinian struggle for survival of the fittest S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"If that means the difference between life and death for an industry, then 
you're describing a marginal industry," says former Treasury Undersecretary 
George Gould. "Maybe the free market is saying you should let it die." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lending May Be Curtailed 
</P>
<P>
U.S. banks are going to be under pressure from the similar capital requirements 
already approved by the Federal Reserve. Although the banking industry as a 
whole is already close to meeting the standards for 1991, a number of big banks 
are going to have to pull in their horns and reduce the pace of their lending 
to ensure that they do not fall back below the line. 
</P>
<P>
That will open the door even wider to well-capitalized foreign banks, 
particularly from Japan. Strong foreign banks, already well established in such 
U.S. beachheads as California, are expected to be at the forefront of the 
merger and acquisition frenzy that is already beginning to sweep over the 
long-sheltered American financial system. 
</P>
<P>
"As we move toward tougher capital requirements, the response of most managers 
will be to shrink their assets to conform with their existing capital base 
rather than try to raise new funds," says Jerry Jordan, chief economist at 
First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "A lot of foreign banks have such deep 
pockets, though, that they don't have that problem. As a result, we're going to 
be giving more of the domestic banking market to foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts agree that foreign banks, which must meet the same standards as U.S. 
banks if they are to operate here, will make further inroads in the business of 
making loans to American business and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cites U.S. Debtor Position 
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable that those who have the most money will get ahead in this 
business," says Litan of Brookings. "Of course, given the net debtor position 
of the United States, we should be happy to get the money from wherever we 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whatever compromise emerges from Congress, analysts are convinced 
that the thrift industry has no choice but to shrink. "We're clearly headed 
toward consolidation of a large portion of the thrift industry," says Paul 
Horvitz, a banking expert at the University of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
And Catherine England, a financial expert at the free-market-oriented Cato 
Institute here, predicts: "We'll see a lot smaller thrift industry and one that 
looks increasingly like the banking industry. It will be harder and harder to 
tell them apart." 
</P>
<P>
But just because the number of thrifts decline sharply, housing finance will 
not necessarily dry up as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The rationale for the system has largely evaporated, but much of what they do 
is also done by mortgage bankers," says Meltzer, who served as a White House 
economic consultant during the last year of Ronald Reagan's presidency. "The 
only exception is ARMs (adjustable rate mortgages) -- there still is a market 
for S&amp;Ls to put some of those together." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Void Being Filled 
</P>
<P>
Albert Wojnilower, a senior adviser to First Boston Corp. in New York, says 
that any void left in housing finance will quickly be filled. "Given the 
evolution of the technology of finance," he says, "you no longer need a local 
institution to make a local mortgage." 
</P>
<P>
Wojnilower sees the decline of the savings and loan industry as part of a trend 
stretching back to the early 1970s, when the first money-market funds sprang up 
as deposit-collecting rivals to the traditional thrift institutions. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, he contends, the nation's financial system will emerge from the 
debacle in better shape than before. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this as a case of lambs thrown to the wolves," he says. "On the 
contrary, the others will be better off because the weak ones have been 
eliminated."

POPULAR DRUG FOR AIDS SEEN AS INEFFECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT STEINBROOK, Times Medical Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New scientific data indicates that oral dextran, one of the most popular 
underground AIDS remedies, is unlikely to be effective, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Government AIDS scientists and some researchers have been aware of the data for 
more than a month but have made no public announcement, Dr. Frank E. Young, the 
commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The experimental drug, which had been considered promising, is not 
significantly absorbed into the bloodstream, according to new human and animal 
studies. As a result, oral dextran is unlikely to protect infection-fighting 
white blood cells against the ravages of the human immunodeficiency virus, 
which is the cause of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the decision to remain silent reflected the "preliminary" nature of 
the results and his fears that an announcement might dash the hopes of 
thousands of HIV-infected individuals who are believed to be taking oral 
dextran. 
</P>
<P>
But some AIDS physicians said it is important to get the new information out so 
that individuals who are taking the drug and their physicians can reassess the 
use of the medication. 
</P>
<P>
Young confirmed Friday that the initial results of government-sponsored tests 
show that oral dextran "does not appear to be significantly absorbed" and "does 
not have the promise of effectiveness that a lot of people thought and that we 
hoped prior to having this information." 
</P>
<P>
Young said in a telephone interview that he "felt compelled to answer (The 
Times) honestly." He said that patients "should really stay tuned for further 
information." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Hoth, the director of the AIDS Program at the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned that the data is preliminary and 
that it is "theoretically possible" that those who take the compound for many 
months can have "increased absorption of dextran over time." But he 
acknowledged that "clinical pharmacologists have told me that there is not much 
precedent for this." 
</P>
<P>
Hoth added that officials at the institute and university researchers working 
with the drug are reviewing data from a six-month 60-patient study of oral 
dextran. That government-sponsored study, which began last August, is expected 
to help answer the lingering question about the absorption of oral dextran and 
provide new data about its effectiveness against HIV. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is any great mystery about why there has been no 
announcement," Hoth said. "We are dealing with scientific complexity, and we 
want to make sure that everything is pulled together before making a strong 
public statement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Harmful' to Inject 
</P>
<P>
Young also issued a strong warning to individuals who might now consider 
injecting the medication directly into the bloodstream. That "could be very, 
very harmful," he said. When injected, dextran, a potent blood thinner, can 
cause bleeding, infections or severe allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Previous data has suggested that the oral dextran is unlikely to be harmful 
when taken by mouth, although it may cause gastrointestinal side-effects, such 
as bloating and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael S. Gottlieb, the Los Angeles AIDS physician who first described 
cases of the mysterious disease in 1981, said he tells his patients that they 
should "make up their own minds" about oral dextran but emphasizes that there 
is "no evidence" that the drug is absorbed. 
</P>
<P>
"Most patients are enlightened enough to know that something that is not 
absorbed from their gastrointestinal tract is unlikely to benefit the 
widespread viral infection in their body," said Gottlieb, who practices at 
Sherman Oaks Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Gottlieb added that the health establishment has a "duty" to make public early 
information about AIDS therapies that appear unlikely to be effective, like 
dextran, as well as therapies that appear beneficial, like AZT and aerosol 
pentamidine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once Considered Promising 
</P>
<P>
Oral dextran had been considered a promising experimental therapy because of 
laboratory studies showing that the compound can both prevent the AIDS virus 
from infecting immune system cells in test tubes and interfere with the ability 
of the virus to kill these cells. The drug is manufactured by Ueno Fine 
Chemical Industry Ltd. of Osaka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, HIV-infected individuals from across the country have 
organized "buyers' clubs" that import the inexpensive drug from Japan, where it 
has been sold for many years without prescription as a treatment for 
atherosclerosis, or fatty collections in the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
The buyers' clubs make oral dextran available to people who want to purchase it 
for their own use. Some take the drug under the supervision of physicians and 
some use it surreptitiously, even while taking part in trials of other 
experimental agents. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from buyers' clubs and other AIDS support organizations about 
difficulties in obtaining oral dextran prompted the FDA last summer to allow 
patients to legally import small quantities of unapproved medicines for 
personal use against AIDS and other diseases. These groups, however, have 
continued to criticize the FDA and the national institute for delays in 
initiating federal tests of oral dextran and other anti-AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The new studies shedding doubt on the absorption of oral dextran involve six 
healthy human volunteers at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore and FDA 
studies in laboratory rats. According to Young, they indicated that the 
"bioavailability (of dextran) by the oral route was essentially non-existent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conference Call Report 
</P>
<P>
The dose tested in humans -- 1,800 milligrams -- is within the range of doses 
that AIDS patients have been administering to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
These findings were shared among officials of the FDA, the national institute 
and AIDS investigators involved in other dextran studies in a conference 
telephone call on Jan. 11, Young said. Some people active in AIDS support 
organizations have been informally made aware of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
The studies involved two techniques. First, FDA scientists attempted to 
directly measure the drug in the bloodstream of the rats by "high pressure 
liquid chromatography" but were unable to detect it, according to Young. 
</P>
<P>
Second, a team of Johns Hopkins scientists used an indirect detection method 
that was considered even more sensitive by the FDA. This method took advantage 
of dextran's ability, when injected directly into a vein, to interfere with the 
ability of the blood to clot. 
</P>
<P>
When oral dextran was administered to the healthy volunteers as a single oral 
dose, no effect on blood clotting was found, Young said. By comparison, when 
dextran was administered intravenously to the volunteers in a lower dose, 
easily measurable blood thinning effects were observed. For this reason, AIDS 
researchers hope to begin studies of intravenous dextran. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Study 
</P>
<P>
Young said the FDA and Johns Hopkins findings also appear to be supported by a 
recent study of oral dextran at San Francisco General Hospital, conducted by a 
research team led by Dr. Donald I. Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
The results of this eight-week, 34-patient study were published Feb. 1 in the 
Annals of Internal Medicine. The study found that the patients' blood clotted 
just as quickly when they received the highest doses of oral dextran (5,400 
milligrams a day) as it did when no dextran was administered. 
</P>
<P>
Abrams, who is also the principal investigator for the ongoing 60-patient 
dextran study, could not be reached for comment on the new data. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are uncertain why dextran appears not to be absorbed. One 
possibility is that a coating, which protects the drug from destructive stomach 
acids, interferes with absorption through the intestine. Another is that the 
drug is degraded by enzymes in the intestine. Still another possible 
explanation may be related to the large size of the molecule. 
</P>
<P>
Dextran is the generic name for a family of large "polysaccharide" molecules 
that contain both glucose and sulfur. The dextran being tested against AIDS has 
a "molecular weight" of 7,000 to 8,000 daltons. By comparison, AZT, or 
azidothymidine, the oral antiviral drug that has been shown to prolong the life 
of some AIDS patients, has a molecular weight of only 267 daltons.

LOUISIANANS DEFY REAGAN, BUSH, ELECT EX-KLAN CHIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
Former national Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, running against a local 
businessman who received endorsements from President Bush and former President 
Ronald Reagan, captured a hotly contested seat in the Louisiana Legislature by 
224 votes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 38, publisher of a newspaper for the National Assn. for the Advancement 
of White People and a proponent of relocating minorities to segregated sections 
of the country, ran as a newly registered Republican. He received 8,456 votes, 
or 51%, in this almost all-white New Orleans suburb to defeat John Treen, 63, 
who got 8,232 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 78% of the registered voters in the 81st House District turned out on a 
chilly, wet day for the runoff election, which was a larger vote here than in 
the presidential election last November, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This election is the greatest political upset in Louisiana history, maybe in 
American history," Duke said. "The people of Metairie have spoken. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been a candidate in recent history who has been more 
attacked, slandered, lied about and hurt in the way I was hurt, and our good 
people were hurt, in this campaign," he said in a victory speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Brother of Ex-Governor 
</P>
<P>
Treen, a Metairie home builder and brother of the state's former governor, 
David Treen, called Duke "a disaster for our area." 
</P>
<P>
"I know what this man really is," he said. "The public . . . doesn't or they 
wouldn't have voted the way they did. He's a master of deception. He conned 
them into believing he is something he is not." 
</P>
<P>
The usually run-of-the-mill election drew worldwide coverage after the 
controversial Duke surprised political observers by changing his party 
affiliation last December and entering a seven-man primary, capturing 33% of 
the vote to Treen's 19%. Since neither candidate received more than half the 
vote, both Republicans were forced into the runoff election. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, who said he left the klan in 1980 but still lists his home phone number 
as the New Orleans klan office, delivered a blow to local, state and national 
Republican leaders with the victory Saturday. They quickly disavowed his 
election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not a Republican' 
</P>
<P>
"David Duke is not a Republican," Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater said 
in a statement released by the party Saturday night. "He's a pretender, a 
charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he 
can find to try to legitimize his views of racial and religious bigotry and 
intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
"We repudiate him in his views, and we will take steps to see that he is 
disenfranchised from our party if he is declared the official winner," Atwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Party officials in Washington said that if Duke is certified the winner, 
Atwater will hold an executive meeting of the Republican National Committee to 
consider a motion of censure that was called "the political equivalent of 
excommunication." The motion would condemn Duke and deny him any form of party 
aid or assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Many other political and civic leaders also opposed Duke. 
</P>
<P>
"He espouses the same philosophies of many Republicans, being against 
affirmative action and set-asides," state Rep. Quentin Dastugue said. "The 
problem is that he backs it up with racism and bigotry." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Efforts by Bush, Reagan 
</P>
<P>
In the last week of the campaign, Bush, Reagan, Atwater and nearly every 
Republican politician in the state threw their support behind Treen. Letters 
from Bush promoting Treen's candidacy arrived at most homes in the district by 
Election Day and a radio advertisement by Reagan urged voters to support Treen. 
</P>
<P>
Treen's campaign sought to remind the voters of Duke's past as a neo-Nazi 
follower of George Lincoln Rockwell and as the imperial wizard of a branch of 
the klan. 
</P>
<P>
In New Orleans, the Roman Catholic archbishop urged voters not to vote for 
Duke, while the president of Loyola University dispatched 785 letters to alumni 
in the district suggesting that they not vote for Duke. 
</P>
<P>
But Duke supporters said that Reagan and Bush, who received more than 80% of 
the vote here in their presidential campaigns, were out of their element in 
this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Reagan's never eaten at the Popeye's chicken where I grew up," said Joseph 
Breau, 31, an electronics engineer. "He never went to the Time Saver (store) 
where I go." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Slime and Sham' 
</P>
<P>
"The people saw through the slime and the sham being spewed forth by our 
competition," said Howie Farrell, Duke's campaign manager. "What does (Reagan) 
know about this place and the people of Metairie. The only thing he knows is 
that when he goes from the airport to New Orleans, this is where they hold up 
the traffic for two hours so he can get through." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election was Duke's latest foray into politics. In 1975 he ran for a 
state Senate seat, making no attempt to hide his klan affiliation, and won a 
third of the vote in an affluent Baton Rouge district. In 1979, he ran for the 
10th District Senate seat in Metairie and won about a fourth of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he ran for the presidency as a member of the Populist Party. In the 
general election, he ran in 15 states and drew less than .05% of the national 
total vote. He began his presidential bid as a Democrat but was repudiated by 
party officials. He got no delegates at the Democratic National Convention.

SOUTHLAND NOT PREPARED FOR SOVIET EMIGRES; 
</P>
<P>
INFLUX TO TAX ALREADY OVERBURDENED SERVICES

<P>
Refugee resettlement efforts in Southern California are about to be overwhelmed 
by thousands of Jews and Armenians who are backed up in Italy and the Soviet 
Union waiting for permission to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"There is just not enough money and services to serve these people in an 
expeditious way," said Bruce Whipple, director of the Los Angeles office of the 
nonprofit International Rescue Committee, which helps find jobs, housing and 
language training for refugees. 
</P>
<P>
With classes already jammed by formerly illegal immigrants who are seeking to 
become citizens, newcomers may have to wait for six months before they can 
study English, he said. Until then, effectively barred from working because 
they cannot speak the language, many refugees depend on welfare, aid from 
community groups or the kindness of relatives, most of whom are themselves 
scraping to get by. 
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming exodus has caught the U.S. government and American relief 
agencies unprepared, according to social workers, relief officials and 
congressmen who want the Bush Administration to let in more refugees. The 
government has offered to allow some of the newcomers into the country under a 
special status that severely limits benefits available to them, adding to their 
anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of refugees coming to Los Angeles from around the world has 
tripled since 1985 -- reaching a high of 19,011 in 1988 -- federal money 
targeted to help the neediest newcomers to Los Angeles county dropped from $7.1 
million in 1985 to $2.8 million last year, said Joan Pinchuk, director of 
community and senior citizen services for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been pleading (for more federal funds) since September," Pinchuk said. 
"These people need to learn how things work here. Coming from the Soviet Union, 
(many) believe they are entitled to government pensions and feel completely 
satisfied being on welfare. There is no way to convince them otherwise if we 
can't put them in acculturation classes." 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders have put the need to fund resettlement efforts for Soviet Jews 
at the top of their fund-raising appeals for 1989. They said they need the 
money to house, retrain and find jobs for newcomers while keeping them off 
welfare during their first months in the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Wonderful Problem to Have' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a wonderful problem to have, but . . . financially very difficult," 
said Wayne Feinstein, executive vice president of the Jewish Federation Council 
of Greater Los Angeles. He said the Jewish Federation Council has increased its 
fund-raising goal to $53 million this year, contrasted with $48 million in 
1986, in order to help cover the costs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the newcomers do well. "Take my example. Not everybody goes on welfare. 
I found work right away," said Alex Fidler, a civil engineer from Odessa who 
first applied to leave the Soviet Union in 1979 and waited 10 years until he 
was allowed to go. 
</P>
<P>
He said he spent two months in the Italian town of Ladispoli but sailed through 
his immigration interview in Rome while others with similar backgrounds were 
rejected as American officials began to run out of coveted refugee visas. 
</P>
<P>
"Fate was kind to me. We tried to understand the reasons why other people were 
refused, but it was impossible," said Fidler, who lives in the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by two cousins, Fidler is working as a cabinetmaker, his wife is 
learning to be a medical assistant, and his son, who was barred from religious 
education in the Soviet Union, is studying for his bar mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful here," Fidler said. "I'm ready to kiss the ground." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parolee Status 
</P>
<P>
But others are less fortunate, separated from their loved ones by the quirks of 
the refugee selection process or frustrated by the lack of services available 
to those who accept the murky status of parolee in order to come into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Alla Vayntrub and her husband, Boris, were happy when they left the Soviet 
Union. But they left their joy behind in Ladispoli where their son and his 
family were refused refugee visas to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"What should I say?" said Alla Vayntrub shortly after moving to Studio City 
last month. She daubed at her eyes with a handkerchief. "I think about the 
little one (her 2-year-old granddaughter, Milana.) I cannot see anything around 
me because my heart is over there." 
</P>
<P>
Vayntrub's son, Alexander, his wife, Aline, and Milana were rejected when 
immigration officials found that they would not have faced "a well-founded fear 
of persecution" had they stayed in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Vayntrubs are appealing their case. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Soviet policy has changed a little bit under Gorbachev, 
anti-Semitism continues on a wide scale and there is a well-founded fear of 
persecution for all of them," said Gregory Makaron, president of the newly 
formed Assn. of Soviet Jewish Immigrants in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the years when fewer Soviets were emigrating, almost all of them who wanted 
to come to the United States were granted refugee status without question. But 
the mass emigration of recent months has nearly exhausted the number of 
American refugee visas, and relief officials say funding more will be a tough 
political challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the federal government has offered parole status for those rejected 
as refugees. Ambartoum Bakhdanyan, newly arrived in Glendale, is a parolee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Refugee Benefits 
</P>
<P>
Admitted to the United States under the government's offer to let in up to 
2,000 emigres a month in without refugee benefits, he and his family are barred 
from immediately seeking citizenship or from taking advantage of federally 
funded programs that help refugees learn English, get medical care, rent an 
apartment or find a job. 
</P>
<P>
Bakhdanyan's sister-in-law rented an apartment for them, and relatives are 
helping them get by. But his wife, who asked that her name not be used, said 
they are already in debt to a physician they have no way to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is sick, and they took him to the doctor and now I have this bill," 
she said. "I need a job. I don't know how to pay it." 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of people have come into the United States as parolees so far, 
but thousands more are expected in the next several months. Los Angeles County 
officials said they expect most of them to settle locally, joining thousands of 
Jews and Armenians who have been leaving the Soviet Union since 1987 as a 
result of an unexpected turnabout in Soviet policy. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch will be even worse this year when the total number leaving the 
Soviet Union may be 40,000 or more. Many of those hope to join friends or 
relatives in Southern California, site of the largest Armenian community 
outside Yerevan, the republic's capital, and home to more Soviet Jewish emigres 
than any American city except New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish emigres generally wait for their American papers at transit points 
in Italy while the Armenians come directly from Moscow, where the waiting time 
for an interview with American immigrations officers can be as long as one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
One Jewish leader compared the situation to the days before and during World 
War II when the American government failed to admit large numbers of refugees 
fleeing the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"The window of opportunity is open, but none of us knows how long (Soviet 
leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev will stay in power. The hard-liners could 
overthrow him and close that window," Ben Zion Leuchter, national president of 
the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, told members of the Los Angeles Jewish 
community during a recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
While it is hard enough for officially sanctioned refugees to find their place 
in America, those who accept the previously little-used parole status find the 
going even rougher, relief workers said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eligible for Welfare 
</P>
<P>
Although they may be eligible for welfare, many parolees do not understand that 
they are not entitled to other benefits enjoyed by officially sanctioned 
refugees, said Zabelle Alahydoian, executive director of the Armenian 
Evangelical Social Service Center. 
</P>
<P>
"They come here, and we look and their passport and we see parolee and we say, 
'Sorry, we can't help you,' " Alahydoian said. "They look at us 
uncomprehendingly. . . . They say, 'How can I be different from my neighbor who 
just came last week and is eligible for all these services and I'm not?' It's 
just really very difficult for them to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced the parole policy Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Full refugee status included the prospect of citizenship, refugee benefits 
include funding for transportation to the United States, a limited period of 
medical care, job training and housing aid, at an estimated cost to the federal 
government of about $7,000 per person. 
</P>
<P>
"The new wrinkle, the terrible wrinkle, is this denial of refugee status," said 
Karl Zukerman, executive vice president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is fiscally motivated since only refugees have any cost attached 
to them. . . . We think that the change of the practice by the American 
government in the middle of the flow is almost a breach of faith," Zukerman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about demographic trends in Israel and Armenia, some members of both 
ethnic groups in the United States share an ambivalence about making it easier 
for their compatriots to come to America. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, leaders of Jewish and Armenian groups have both appealed for the 
granting of more refugee visas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping . . . to see some coming together of the minds," said Mark 
Talisman, Washington director of the Council of Jewish Federations. "We don't 
want to give the Soviets any impression other than that we are absolutely 
delighted with the results of their human rights policy because that's what 
we've been yelling at them about for 50 years."

British Airways began inspecting passengers' electronic and electrical 
equipment following the announcement that explosives hidden in a radio-cassette 
player blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people. 
Britain's biggest airline was acting on a Department of Transport 
recommendation that all airlines using British airports examine radios, 
computers and other electronic or electrical equipment for possible explosives. 
British Airways is asking passengers to remove such equipment from their 
suitcases for a separate security check and, after clearance, to carry the 
pieces aboard as hand baggage. No major delays were reported as a result of the 
increased security.

California 120 leading into Yosemite Valley has been reopened after being 
closed 2 1/2 days by a rock slide. A 60-yard section of the road was clogged by 
huge rocks in a slide park officials blamed on the alternate freezing and 
thawing of recent weeks. Even though five boulders as large as automobiles 
crashed down the mountain onto the pavement, no injuries were reported. Two 
other major routes to Yosemite, California 41 and 140, remained open. 
California 120, which enters the park from the Modesto area via Tuolumne 
County, reopened Friday just in time for throngs heading to Yosemite for the 
three-day President's Day weekend.

A predominantly Polish Roman Catholic church in Bridgeport, Conn., was closed 
indefinitely hours after the city's bishop summoned police to evict dissident 
parishioners. On Friday afternoon, about 100 dissidents shouted down diocesan 
officials who came to St. Michael the Archangel Church to convey Bishop Edward 
M. Egan's offer to meet with them if they would leave peacefully. About 200 
parishioners, occupying the church in shifts, staged a weeklong sit-in to 
protest the transfer announced in December of a popular priest, Father Roman 
Palaszewski, brought from Poland three years ago. Regular church functions have 
continued during the protest. The standoff ended when police arrived and 
ordered about 80 dissidents present to leave. Two people were arrested on 
trespassing charges.

Yosemite National Park officials have decided that photographs hung in a park 
gallery by artist Ken Marcus, a disciple of photographer Ansel Adams, had a 
little too much nature in them. Eight of 10 photographs of nudes that Marcus, a 
Playboy photographer, entered in a show at the park were removed from the 
exhibit and replaced with his photographs of decaying park buildings. 
"Remember, our visitors are mostly families," museum curator Dave Forgang said. 
"We're a museum, yes, but we're right down the path from the Yosemite Visitors 
Center." Marcus, 42, spent a month in the park's artists-in-residence program 
and during his visit posed Hollywood models standing in the buff alongside 
trees and in chilly mountain streams. Marcus said his photographs showed the 
human form as part of nature. He called the censorship "ridiculous."

A Riverside mother who baked 106 Valentine's Day cupcakes for her son's 
kindergarten classmates said they were rejected by school officials who feared 
that the treats could spread AIDS, but administrators denied that was the 
reason. Edwina Hatzenbuehler claimed Principal Corrine Law of Monroe Elementary 
School told her the school had a policy against distributing homemade food, 
possibly because it could have been made in a "dirty house" and threatened 
spread of diseases such as AIDS. Hatzenbuehler said, "It really just hurt my 
feelings. I told her you can't spread AIDS by cupcakes." She added no one in 
her family is suffering from the disease and all are in good health.

Three Americans were wounded, one seriously, when unidentified assailants 
hurled a bomb at a bus carrying 28 U.S. soldiers north of the Honduran capital 
of Tegucigalpa, the U.S. Embassy said. Two Honduran passers-by were also 
injured, police said. An embassy spokeswoman said the Americans were returning 
to the military base at Palmerola after a brief training exercise in Comayagua, 
about 40 miles northwest of the capital, at the time of the attack. It was the 
second attack on American troops in the country this month. On Feb. 1, seven 
vehicles carrying more than 30 U.S. soldiers were attacked by gunmen in 
northern Honduras, but no one was injured.

Military officers from Iran and Iraq will meet Wednesday at their common border 
to help stabilize a cease-fire, U.N. peacekeepers announced. U.N. officials 
said each country will be represented by 10 officers who will work with their 
governments and the U.N. observers to resolve problems in carrying out the Aug. 
20 cease-fire agreement that halted the eight-year Iran-Iraq War. But in 
Baghdad, Tarik Aziz, Iraq's foreign minister, said he sees no hope of positive 
results from fresh peace talks "if the Iranian side continues evading basic 
issues and insists only on propaganda."

RECORD OF VIOLENCE IMPERILS FUTURE OF BORDER CRIME UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, the San Diego Police Department and the U.S. Border Patrol 
launched a joint initiative unique in the United States, the Border Crime 
Prevention Unit, a nighttime foot patrol designed to deter robberies and 
assaults against the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who enter 
the United States from Tijuana each year. 
</P>
<P>
The new anti-crime squad, authorities vowed, would be safer than its swaggering 
predecessor, an undercover outfit of San Diego policemen whose exploits in and 
out of the hazardous border canyons from 1976 through 1978 were chronicled in 
Joseph Wambaugh's book, "Lines and Shadows." 
</P>
<P>
The new unit was to be a high-profile uniformed force that would eschew the 
provocative tactics of the former plainclothes squad that tried to lure robbers 
by dressing and behaving as undocumented border crossers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a shoot-out every night," said San Diego Police Chief Bob 
Burgreen, a deputy chief when the decision was made to disband the old squad. 
</P>
<P>
But the current squad, despite uniforms and intent, has amassed a much more 
violent record than its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
And in the wake of a particularly bloody period -- during a recent two-week 
stretch, unit members shot and killed four robbery suspects -- some critics 
have called for the patrol to be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
In every fatal shooting incident involving the unit, authorities say, the 
suspects attempted to assault the officers, apparently mistaking them in the 
darkness for undocumented border crossers whom they intended to rob. In most 
cases, according to authorities, officers opened fire before they had an 
opportunity to identify themselves as lawmen. 
</P>
<P>
In five years, the dozen or so lawmen assigned to the unit at a given time have 
shot 44 suspects, 18 of whom have died -- a fatal shooting total greater than 
that of the 1,700-member San Diego Police Department during the same period. 
The previous squad killed two suspects during its 18 months of operation. 
</P>
<P>
Most suspects arrested by the squad are caught after attempting to assault the 
officers, not for attacking other aliens. Of the 48 people arrested last year, 
"almost all of them were arrested for trying to rob the border unit," Burgreen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an open question as to who's commiting the most crime -- law 
enforcement or the bandits," said Roberto Martinez, a longtime activist who 
works for the American Friends Service Committee, the social action arm of the 
Quaker church. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen and other top law enforcement officials remain solidly in favor of the 
unit's work in the border area, which is within San Diego city limits, and say 
it will continue its dangerous mission. "Morally," Burgreen said, "there's no 
question that we're doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Gilson, assistant chief Border Patrol agent, added, "From the 
humanitarian point of view, we have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Police and Border Patrol officials insist that the uniformed outfit's operation 
is significantly different from the earlier squad's. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, were we (previously) asking to get into shoot-outs rather 
than prevent them?" Burgreen said during a recent interview. "What we're trying 
to do now is to prevent them and send those casual bandits packing back to 
Mexico. . . . And the only ones that remain are those extremely brazen bandits 
who don't even check to see that they're robbing a cop. . . . I can honestly 
say we're not putting decoys out there." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the current squad shoots more suspects than its predecessor for 
a logical reason: With Mexico's economy in a shambles, more people are crossing 
the border now than were doing so a decade ago. Consequently, there are more 
robbers lurking in the canyons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uniforms Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Manny Lopez, the former San Diego police sergeant who supervised the 
plainclothes unit, contends that the current squad's uniformed status may have 
unwittingly triggered more violence. Robbers and officers may open fire more 
quickly, he maintains, as the stakes are clearly much higher. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're undercover, you have that extra second of hesitation; the bandit 
doesn't know who you are or that you're armed. It gives you an advantage," said 
Lopez, now a private investigator in San Diego. "I know this: I wouldn't go out 
there in uniform. No way." 
</P>
<P>
The dozens of regular uniformed Border Patrol agents who also man the canyons 
each evening are not attacked nearly as often as the special unit's members. 
The reason, said Border Patrol assistant chief Gilson, is that regular Border 
Patrol agents stay close to their vehicles, even when on foot, and are 
therefore more easily identifiable as law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
No special unit member has been shot since May, 1985, when Border Patrol Agent 
Fred Stevens took five bullets. He survived, probably because he was wearing a 
bullet-proof vest. Three Border Patrol agents have been shot during the current 
unit's five-year history; all three recovered. During the 18-month operation of 
the previous outfit, three officers were also shot, but never by robbers: Two 
were shot by other unit members, the third by a Tijuana policeman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Investigation 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent shooting, on Jan. 4, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has 
begun a preliminary inquiry into allegations that two suspects were shot and 
killed while handcuffed and fleeing back to Mexico. Police say the men were 
shot when they attempted to assault the lawmen. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations prompted the Mexican Embassy in Washington to send a note to 
the State Department questioning the "disproportionate" use of force -- the 
dead men were armed with screwdrivers and knives, the officers with 
semi-automatic pistols and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
A survivor of the Jan. 4 shooting, like a number of others who have recovered 
from such confrontations, has maintained that he was a smuggler shot without 
provocation by patrol officers, who he initially assumed were Central American 
migrants. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office, which reviews law enforcement 
shootings, has ruled that the officers were justified in using deadly force in 
each of the fatal shootings involving the unit. The most recent two cases, 
involving four deaths, are pending. 
</P>
<P>
The squad has been largely inactive since Jan. 4 -- officials say they have 
been reviewing procedures since the latest shooting -- but the officers are 
expected to be redeployed within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Critics object to the unit's return, maintaining that the many uniformed Border 
Patrol officers deployed at the border should be sufficient deterrent to crime. 
"If these were white Americans getting shot, there wouldn't be any question of 
pulling the unit out," said Martinez, the rights advocate. "There would have 
been an outcry a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
The eight or so miles of border separating San Diego and Tijuana is a unique 
strip along the 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Nowhere else do so many people 
attempt to enter the United States through such rugged terrain. 
</P>
<P>
It is the single largest gateway for the job markets of California and 
elsewhere in the United States. Each evening, hundreds, sometimes thousands, of 
border crossers mass just inside U.S. territory, awaiting the cover of darkness 
to attempt entry beyond the narrow border strip. 
</P>
<P>
With so much traffic, a very specialized economy has evolved in the rugged belt 
of U.S. territory. At principal staging areas, vendors hawk food and clothing. 
Marijuana and liquor are widely available. Smugglers flaunt their services. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprising thieves seek easy pickings from the border crossers, many of whom 
carry their life savings. The migrants are universally referred to as pollos 
(chickens). 
</P>
<P>
Statistics regarding border violence are inconclusive. Everyone agrees that the 
majority of crimes -- robberies, rapes, assaults -- go unreported, as 
undocumented people are hesitant to run to authorities. Only 40 robberies were 
reported in the border strip during 1988, police said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer Robberies 
</P>
<P>
The number of reported robberies has, in fact, declined since 1986, when 170 
were recorded. Authorities cite the decline as an indication of the unit's 
effectiveness. The decrease also corresponds with what U.S. officials say is a 
sharp drop in the number of illegal border crossers since the passage of 
revised immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
The only reliable crime figure from the canyons, Burgreen suggests, is for 
murder. Homicide figures from the canyons have fluctuated without any 
discernable pattern since 1984, however, when the current unit was first 
deployed. There was one murder in 1984 and nine in 1985. There were six murders 
in 1986, two in 1987 and five in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Unit officers killed six suspects in 1988, the highest number in the unit's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the unit's presence has reduced the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced, no question, that we are deterring violence in the canyons, and 
we're keeping innocent people from being victimized and murdered," Burgreen 
said. "If we weren't in the canyons patroling, I shudder to think how many 
(victims) we would have found."

SURFEIT OF USED NEWSPRINT ERASES PROFIT IN RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ty Woodward recalls when members of the North Hollywood Optimist Club last year 
loaded bundles of old newspapers into his Dodge van, hauled them to the Woodsy 
Owl recycling center in Van Nuys and walked away with as much as $80 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling used newsprint was so lucrative that one Optimist Club drive raised 
enough money to send 20 boys from Troop 3 of the West Los Angeles Council of 
Boy Scouts to camp for a week. 
</P>
<P>
But these days, if the Optimists want to raise money, they would be wise to try 
something else. The same advice applies to nonprofit organizations, schools and 
churches throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the going rate for a ton of papers at most recycling centers in the 
region was $20; in some places it was low as $15 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs me more to take (the newspapers) out there than it pays," said 
Woodward, a semi-retired businessman who has been organizing newspaper drives 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward said he continues to make deliveries because of his commitment to the 
Boy Scouts. But others are finding that the payoff is not worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're going to have to get our funds from somewhere else," said 
Mona Burkholder, a paper drive organizer at Gordon H. Beatty Elementary School 
in Buena Park. Last year, income from paper deliveries to a local recycling 
center averaged about $200, Burkholder said. The one delivery the school made 
this year earned $90, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, groups that once were paid as much as $100 a ton for 
newspapers cannot give away the papers they have collected in curb-side bins. 
All over the region, more and more recycling centers are halting the practice 
of collecting the papers because it is not worth the trouble. Some centers have 
stopped accepting newspapers altogether. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Glut 
</P>
<P>
Recycling center officials said the price drop is the result of what may be a 
long-lasting, nationwide glut of used newsprint. The reason: a proliferation of 
mandatory municipal recycling programs designed to save dwindling landfill 
space. Although cities are also affected by the price drop, their main goals 
are not to make money but to dispose of waste. 
</P>
<P>
Most mandatory programs are concentrated on the East Coast, where the need for 
landfills is critical. 
</P>
<P>
"The program in New York alone will stimulate 36,000 tons of paper every 
month," said Gary Petersen, vice president of Ecolo-Haul, a recycling firm with 
centers in the Los Angeles area. "That's enough to flood the world market." 
</P>
<P>
In some Eastern states, Petersen said, people who have collected tons of 
newspaper are having to pay someone to take it off their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Under the mandatory programs, municipal sanitation agencies will not pick up 
trash unless it is separated into recyclable and non-recyclable items. 
Newspapers are the major recyclable product Americans toss away, environmental 
experts say. The value of old newspapers, even in the best of times, is much 
lower than either bottles or cans, which command as much as $160 a ton. With 
the current glut, the pay-out for old papers is the lowest it has been in 
years, and it is dropping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mandatory Recycling 
</P>
<P>
Some California cities already have voluntary programs, but state legislators 
last year began discussing mandatory, statewide recycling of newspapers as well 
as bottles and cans, said Chris Velez of San Jose's Office of Environmental 
Management. She said San Jose's voluntary program generates 1,400 tons of 
newspaper each month out of a total of 1,950 tons of recyclable materials. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has experimented on a small scale since the 1950s with voluntary 
recycling programs in some neighborhoods, but the city is now financing a study 
that could lead to a mandatory, citywide plan by this summer, said John 
Stodder, Mayor Tom Bradley's aide on environmental issues. Such a program, 
Stodder said, would involve 720,000 residences. 
</P>
<P>
Stodder said the study will consider the impact of a mandatory program on 
newspaper collection drives by charitable groups and schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Our nightmare is New York, where they just began dumping newspapers on the 
market and driving the price for them down to zero," Stodder said. "We are 
lucky in that we are in a position to learn from their mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Petersen of Ecolo-Haul said city officials and recycling industry 
representatives need to "sit down together and think about" what might be done 
to protect individuals and groups that rely on newspaper collection drives, as 
well as recycling firms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Uses 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems, he said, is that recycled newsprint is of a low quality 
and has limited uses. It mainly is reused by newspapers and in making 
insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Melkerson, manager of newsprint operations for the Los Angeles Times, said 
that of the 455,000 tons of newsprint The Times used last year, about 380,000 
tons contained at least 50% recycled fiber. Many newspapers do not use any 
recycled newsprint, Melkerson said, adding that the price of newsprint made 
from recycled papers and regular newsprint is virtually the same. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hathaway, an inventory control supervisor for newsprint operations at The 
Times, said that is because of the relatively high costs of removing "garbage," 
such as staples, strings and wires, from old newspapers that have been returned 
to a pulpy state and of bleaching the ink out of them.

TIMES NAMED CALIFORNIA'S BEST PAPER FOR SECOND YEAR IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second year in a row, The Times has won top honors from the California 
Newspaper Publishers Assn. for general excellence among papers with a daily 
circulation above 75,000, it was announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time The Times has won the general excellence award in the 
last four years. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also won the CNPA's first prize for an editorial series, regardless 
of circulation. In addition, the paper finished first among large papers in 
awards given for editorial cartooning, sports coverage, business and financial 
coverage and arts and entertainment coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Among other large papers in California, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat and the 
San Jose Mercury News each took five top awards, the Orange County Register 
took three, the Sacramento Union won two and the Bakersfield Californian, the 
Sacramento Bee, the San Francisco Examiner, the San Diego Union, the San

More than a foot of snow fell Saturday over parts of the Northwest and the 
mid-Atlantic Coast, canceling airline flights, closing one highway with an 
avalanche and shutting down weekend sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Rivers flooded by five days of rain, meanwhile, slowly receded in Kentucky and 
Tennessee, where hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 17 inches of snow had fallen on northern North Carolina in Warren and 
Stokes counties, and 14 inches was reported at historic Williamsburg, Va., the 
National Weather Service said. Norfolk, Va., had 12 inches, second-highest on 
record there for February. In the Northwest, Spokane, Wash., had 13 inches of 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Power Losses in Carolinas 
</P>
<P>
Sleet and freezing rain coated other parts of Virginia and the Carolinas with 
ice, and scattered power outages were reported in upstate South Carolina, the 
weather service said. About 23,000 people lost power in North Carolina, Duke 
Power Co. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About a foot of snow caused all airlines operating at Patrick Henry Airport at 
Newport News, Va., to cancel their flights, stranding about 200 people, airport 
executive director Peter Daikos said. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Virginia, Saturday classes at Norfolk State University were 
canceled, said school spokesman Gerald Tyler, and a number of college 
basketball games were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
The snow and icy roads in North Carolina arrived just two days after the state 
basked in 80-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Wrecks are coming in from every which direction . . . " said Bobby Norville, 
an emergency communications dispatcher in Pitt County. 
</P>
<P>
Steady snow fell Saturday on the eastern two-thirds of Washington state as the 
most severe snowstorm to hit the state this winter slowed traffic to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. 2 near Stevens Pass, Wash., was closed for about two hours during the 
night after an avalanche dumped about four feet of snow. Hours earlier, at 
least 35 cars were involved in a pileup in blinding snow on Interstate 90, 
about five miles east of North Bend. 
</P>
<P>
In western Tennessee, Tennessee Emergency Management Agency workers were in 
Obion County assessing the damage caused by flooding there earlier in the week. 
It did not rain Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
400 Forced From Homes 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 people were forced from their homes when the Obion River spilled 
over its banks in the heart of the Tennessee wheat belt. 
</P>
<P>
The Kentucky River at Frankfort had dropped four feet since cresting Friday at 
44.2 feet, 13.2 feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
Streams in southern Ohio also receded after flash flooding. 
</P>
<P>
The first estimates by federal officials pegged Kentucky's flood damage at $22 
million, but the Army's top engineer, Robert W. Page, assistant secretary of 
the Army for civil works, said Saturday that was "only the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
Five shelters remained open around Kentucky, housing 142 people, said spokesman 
Don Armstrong of the state Division of Disaster and Emergency Services, and 184 
state-maintained roads in 54 counties remained blocked by high water.

REPORT CITES PILOT, TOWER ERRORS IN AZORES CRASH

Investigators reportedly are focusing on pilot and controller errors and 
confusing radio exchanges as likely causes of an airliner crash in the Azores 
earlier this month that killed 144 people. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times, in its Saturday editions, reported that tape recordings of 
conversations between the pilots and air controllers indicate the pilots 
believed they had been cleared to descend to 2,000 feet, when in fact the 
controllers had said 3,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the controllers apparently gave the crew an incorrect barometric 
setting for the jet's altimeter. The newspaper cited sources who said such a 
mistake might have accounted for the jet being an additional 300-foot lower 
than its pilots thought. 
</P>
<P>
If the plane had remained at 2,000 feet or above, it would have cleared the 
1,936-foot peak, highest on the island, where the crash occurred, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The chartered Boeing 707 carrying 137 Italian tourists and a crew of seven to 
the Caribbean was preparing to land for a refueling stop at the Santa Maria 
airport Feb. 8 when it crashed into the mountain. There were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The airport at Santa Maria does not have sophisticated radar that tells 
controllers a plane's altitude. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is focusing on why the pilots would have accepted the order 
to descend to 2,000 feet when they had not reached the point where they would 
begin a series of turns in preparation for landing. Official navigation charts 
set 3,000 feet as the minimum altitude for planes approaching the Azores, the 
newspaper said.

Authorities admitted Saturday that some prisoners have been tortured to death, 
but they said the number is lower than that alleged by Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
In a report published last month, the London-based human rights group accused 
Turkish authorities of routinely torturing political detainees since martial 
law was imposed in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International said it gave the government a list of 239 men and women 
alleged to have died from torture and ill-treatment while in custody. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said an investigation into 146 of these cases 
showed that torture was suspected in the deaths of 32 detainees or prisoners in 
the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry said 10 of the people cited as dead by Amnesty International are 
still alive and that others had died of natural causes, suicide, effects of 
hunger strikes or in shoot-outs with security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Trials in 14 cases have resulted in convictions of 57 people on charges of 
torture and ill-treatment of prisoners, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry added that all allegations concerning human rights violations in 
Turkey were examined "meticulously."

SCANDAL SPOTLIGHTS COSTA RICA'S BATTLE ON DRUGS 
</P>

SAN JOSE, Costa Rica 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Roberto Fionna, a discreet and wealthy Argentine, owned the best Italian 
restaurant in town and, according to investigators, had the most influential 
friends money could buy. 
</P>
<P>
His arrest and extradition to France on heroin trafficking charges last year 
set off a national inquiry that has shaken Costa Rica's political 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
After public hearings into Fionna's web of protection, three high court 
magistrates, an ambassador and the chief criminal investigator of the judicial 
police agency have resigned, and a prominent lawmaker is under pressure to quit 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal, which has riveted national attention, reflects the vulnerability 
of Central America's most open and peaceful society to drug dealers seeking 
either refuge for themselves or new routes for Colombian cocaine to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in a country with no army and not enough radar to track every aircraft, the 
continuing investigation by a Legislative Assembly panel seems to show the 
strength of Costa Rican democratic institutions in fighting corruption by the 
drug barons. 
</P>
<P>
President Oscar Arias Sanchez, who was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for 
trying to stop guerrilla conflicts in Central America, has put a high priority 
on stopping drugs. At his initiative, the Legislative Assembly last May enacted 
what U.S. officials call the toughest anti-narcotics law in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised address, Arias warned that "precarious political situations" in 
Panama and in Central America have "induced international rogues to try and 
test our stability and our respect for the law with their contemptible 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
With its lax immigration laws, unpatrolled coastlines and a multitude of 
private airstrips, Costa Rica became a major way-station for U.S.-bound 
Colombian cocaine in the mid-1980s, police officials say. This followed 
successful efforts to reduce cocaine shipments through the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1984, Costa Rican police captured an average of one kilogram (2.2 
pounds) of cocaine a year, according to Carlos Saurez of the Public Security 
Ministry. Without a major increase in police power, he said, total cocaine 
seizures since 1985 have soared to 3,000 kilograms. 
</P>
<P>
Hernan Vargas, a narcotics specialist on the judicial police force, estimates 
that 1,500 kilograms of cocaine pass through the country every month, typically 
entering in small aircraft and leaving by sea in legally registered containers 
of shrimp, pineapple and other perishables. 
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction is not yet a serious problem in Costa Rica, and the only known 
venture into cocaine production here was stopped in 1986 when police destroyed 
a major Colombian-run laboratory in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But with fewer than 120 police agents assigned to drug interdiction and a 
$700,000 annual drug budget, law enforcement officials say they are overwhelmed 
by the narcotrafico. 
</P>
<P>
"We're like ants fighting an elephant," said Eduardo Araya, Costa Rica's chief 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials and lawmakers believe the lack of an army, though it is an asset 
to Arias' peace campaign, makes Costa Rica an easier target for drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike their counterparts in neighboring countries -- where the army is the 
power behind weak civilian institutions -- Costa Rican police, lawmakers, 
judges and news media investigate corruption aggressively and work as a check 
on each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The Costa Ricans' record (against drugs) is fairly impeccable," said Robert 
Nieves, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency official. "They are making all the right 
moves. Their front line of defense is that they prosecute to the limit. The 
traffickers cannot bribe their way out. There's a significant taint factor that 
goes along with association with a fugitive like Fionna." 
</P>
<P>
The three-month investigation of Fionna's influence showed that he paid for a 
Honda sedan and an apartment used by Ricardo Umana, the third-ranking official 
in the judicial police. He also donated rice and beans to be served at rallies 
for Arias' party during the 1986 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Fionna, who testified that Umana was his "best friend in Costa Rica," wrote 
letters on police stationery and gave the official $3,600 to assure Costa Rican 
resident status for two Thai immigrants wanted on drug charges in France, the 
investigators were told. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also reported that three Supreme Court magistrates and a lawmaker 
tried to protect Umana. The magistrates resigned under censure in November, as 
did Umana and the Costa Rican ambassador, who had invited Fionna to move here 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Assembly is now looking into other politically sensitive cases. 
One involves Ricardo Alem, a former campaign fund-raiser for Arias who 
allegedly parlayed his presidential appointment to head a development bank into 
ventures involving the laundering of drug money. Alem was arrested last year 
after being linked to an attempt to smuggle $750,000 in cash into Costa Rica 
wrapped in campaign stickers of a presidential candidate from Arias' party. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent case is that of John Hull, an Indiana-born farmer with U.S. and 
Costa Rican citizenship. Hull, a powerful figure in Costa Rica who worked for 
the CIA as liaison with U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based near his ranch, was 
arrested last month on charges of cocaine smuggling and violating Costa Rican 
neutrality. 
</P>
<P>
Alem and Hull face trial under the new anti-narcotics law, which automatically 
denies bail, rules out executive pardon and threatens the same eight- to 
20-year prison term for small-scale marijuana users and big-time cocaine 
smugglers. It also outlaws money laundering and allows the state to keep boats, 
planes or other vehicles seized with drugs on board. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an atmosphere of national exorcism against anything that smells of 
drugs," Information Minister Guido Fernandez Saborio said. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the new law, several officials agreed, they cannot expect to 
reduce the drug traffic. They can only hope to keep it from expanding, leaking 
into an internal market or corrupting the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
What alarms political leaders and law enforcement officials most about the 
Fionna case, and several recent ones like it, is the use of drug money in 
recent election campaigns. By some estimates, tens of millions of drug-tainted 
dollars flow through Costa Rica's currency black market each month. 
</P>
<P>
"Fionna committed no crime in Costa Rica, but he threw his money around," said 
Alberto Fait, head of the legislative panel investigating drugs. "That is how 
those people work. They can use you without your knowing it. They can buy 
political influence and break the moral defenses of society. All this easy 
money in such large quantities is a danger we are not accustomed to." 
</P>
<P>
Some officials are uneasy with the panel's standard of guilt by association. 
Arias and two former presidents have denied knowing that certain contributors 
to their campaigns were drug traffickers. Leonel Villalobos, the assemblyman 
censored for protecting Umana, has ignored the panel's demand that he resign 
and is leading a campaign to reject its findings. 
</P>
<P>
"It is illogical to say that if I knew someone who was a friend of Fionna, then 
I should resign," Villalobos told the assembly. "If that's the way it works, 
then Fait should resign too." 
</P>
<P>
Fait countered in an interview: "The climate in the country has changed. The 
people do not want scapegoats. We are not going after bit players, messengers 
and chauffeurs. We are going after the masterminds of the plots and the 
crimes."

No one ever confused Allen McCanless with T. S. Eliot, but listen to the gait 
of his words and you can smell the prairie winds. Listen and you hear a 
cowboy's soul, alone and free in the vast kingdom of Western mythology: 
</P>
<P>
 ... My ceiling the sky, my carpet the grass, 
</P>
<P>
 My music the lowing of herds as they pass; 
</P>
<P>
 My books are the brooks, my sermons the stones, 
</P>
<P>
 My parson's a wolf on a pulpit of bones ... 
</P>
<P>
 McCanless' poem, published in 1885 and once sung as a night-herding tune, is 
an example of cowboy poetry, part of a little-studied oral tradition of the 
West that still flourishes on ranches from Montana to Texas. Unlikely as it may 
sound, no working men in America are more closely identified with writing and 
reciting poetry than cowboys. And none get more quizzical looks than a cowboy 
who comes out of the closet and admits he is a practicing poet. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been writing poetry for years," said Gene Jordan, a cowboy from Bayfield, 
Colo. "I kept a pen hidden under the bed all that time 'cause my wife'd say: 
'Don't embarrass people with that garbage.' She's my ex-wife now." 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, poetry was the cowboy's secret, a private language for the 
expression of shared experiences. It was full of creaking leather and the tramp 
of horses' feet and the smoke of campfires many miles from all concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Let people that set and talk explain 
</P>
<P>
 just whether I'm wrong or right. 
</P>
<P>
 My hoss is pullin' the bridle reins 
</P>
<P>
 and I'm hittin' the trail tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruce Kiskadoon 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the closet door started opening on cowboy poetry. On a tour of 
Western ranches, Utah folklorist Hal Cannon was amazed to find that poetry was 
still as much a part of the modern cowboy's life as it had been in the days of 
the unfenced range. This storytelling in verse represented, he thought, an 
important form of American folklore that deserved to be heard and preserved. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the Western Folklore Center in Salt Lake City, Cannon organized 
the first Cowboy Poetry Gathering here in Elko in 1985. More than 50 working 
cowboys showed up to recite their poems. They came not to mourn a vanishing era 
but to celebrate a life that is still as free and independent as any we know 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Since that first session, cowboy poets have appeared on the "Tonight Show" and 
"Good Morning, America," and toured college campuses as far east as Dartmouth 
in Hanover, N.H. They are suddenly in demand at cattlemen's conventions and 
county fairs throughout the West, and cowboy poetry festivals are scheduled 
this summer from Big Timber, Mont., to Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thin Volumes 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 books of cowboy poetry -- many of them thin volumes published 
privately and available only in tack shops and local drugstores -- are on the 
market. Baxter Black alone has sold more than 50,000 copies of his books. 
Cannon's anthology of cowboy poetry has sold 30,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at cowboy poetry as a technician, you can riddle it," Cannon said. 
"It's simple meter, simple form. But people reserve poetry for the most 
important things they have to say. Throughout time, our best histories of 
different civilizations have come through poetry, because poetry is what you 
feel about your history and how you make the language sing. So if you look for 
the emotions, the pure language, the vernacular, cowboy poetry becomes very 
heady, wonderful stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The cowboys -- more than 200 of them this time, plus 1,500 or so friends and 
fans -- came to Elko again recently, for the fifth annual poetry gathering. 
They wore tight Levi's, bandannas, shirts with snap buttons and ten-gallon hats 
that are not removed, even during dinner. Many, like Waddie Mitchell, the ranch 
boss on a spread outside Elko, had spent the previous day tending cattle, 
carrying hay through the snow-covered meadows and preparing for the March 
calving season. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Town 
</P>
<P>
Elko (population 16,000) made them feel at home. It is still a cowboy town, 
just as it was in the 1800s when longhorns were driven to the railhead here. It 
is a place where people do not wear granny glasses or order cherries in their 
cocktails. Bartenders at the Stockmen's and the century-old Commercial Hotel 
hand customers bottles of beer, on the assumption that no one would drink beer 
from a glass, and at J. M. Capriola's, one of the West's finest saddle makers, 
cowboys speak in hushed tones as though they had entered a church. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone in improper dress stands out like a choirboy. When Kim Stafford, a 
(non-cowboy) poet and essayist from Oregon, attended the gathering two years 
ago wearing a straw Stetson, a man from Montana took him gently aside and said: 
"Son, we don't wear straw in the winter. Besides, that hat's got a Texas crease 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
For three days, these men and women from places such as Stagecoach, Nev.; 
Eagle, Ida.; Red Owl, S.D., and Lomita, Tex., shared their poems with each 
other in the Elko Convention Center. Clarence Wager, speaking of the man who 
patented barbed wire, said that "Joe Glidden's dream is a pretty poor scheme 
for keeping this business alive," and Don Kennington read a poem to his 
82-year-old cowboy-father who had taught him to mount a horse from the left, 
milk a cow from the right, stay behind a mule and in front of a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Their poems were about people and real happenings, about ornery broncs and long 
trails, about a love that is between not man and woman but man and land. Nearly 
all, like the late Badger Clark's "A Cowboy's Prayer," echoed with an 
appreciation of a life not miscast: 
</P>
<P>
 I thank you, Lord, that I am placed so well, 
</P>
<P>
 That you have made my freedom so complete 
</P>
<P>
 That I'm no slave of whistle, clock or bell, 
</P>
<P>
 Nor weak-eyed prisoner of wall and street. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever popularity cowboy poetry has gained in the West, its appeal does not 
stretch far over the Rockies. The New York Times Book Review devoted a full 
page to the medium in January under the headline: "Whoop-ee-ti-yo, Git Along 
Little Doggerel." The article's author, Edward Hoagland, concluded: "Cowboys 
don't really write poetry any better than lawyers play golf, but you can learn 
a good deal about lawyers by how they play golf." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps. But Western literature -- the success of Larry McMurtry and the late 
Louis L'Amour not withstanding -- has generally not been favorably received in 
the East either. It is considered the stuff of dime novels and were it not for 
university presses from Oklahoma westward, many notable works of the West never 
would have been published. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
"It's true, there's a real struggle to get this stuff published, even deserving 
manuscripts," said Robert Cowley, a New York editor who has worked for several 
major publishing houses. "Why the reluctance? The reason is New York. People in 
publishing here have a vacation and they go to Europe. Oh, they might go to 
California, but they certainly don't go to Montana or Nevada. This is a very 
insular business, focused on New York and London. There is little awareness of 
other parts of the country." 
</P>
<P>
As cowboy poetry -- and the Elko gathering -- grow more popular, Cannon, the 
folklorist, sees potential danger. If the medium becomes overtly commercial, it 
will lose its authenticity. The poets will play to their audiences, instead of 
to each other. Or worse, the poets will be dudes from State Street instead of 
hired hands from the Double Bar X. 
</P>
<P>
"When things get popular and you're in front of an audience, strange things 
start to happen," said Wally McRae, a Montana rancher. "You tend to read or 
recite funny. Our experiences come from deep emotion, and in front of an 
audience, you're apt to forget that and just look instead for acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stories to Tell 
</P>
<P>
But as the language of the working range, cowboy poetry will probably survive 
as long as cowboys have cattle to move and stories to tell about it. In Elko, a 
visitor whose ears are tuned to city murmurings can hear the song of magic 
words in every conversation, as one did recently when two cowboys with drooping 
mustaches met at the Stockmen's bar. The jukebox was playing Keith Whitley's 
"Hard Livin' " and the two men talked quietly while both stared straight ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you heal up pretty good after gettin' throwed, John?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yup, I don't hurt nowhere anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you about bein' crippled up. You been crippled up more'n me." 
</P>
<P>
"Only problem I got now is I can't bend over for any period a time. Can't shoe 
a horse even. But I can still ride pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you know I got a new baby daughter, 15 months ago?" 
</P>
<P>
"You don't say." 
</P>
<P>
"Yup. Course, don't know what to do with her 'cept put her on the table as a 
centerpiece, but I sure am delighted to have the little buckaroo."

EX-KLANSMAN, ACTIVIST IN GOP FACE OFF AT POLLS;

RACISM BECOMES ISSUE IN LOUISIANA CONTEST

<P>
David Duke, a former grand wizard in the Ku Klux Klan, and home builder John 
Treen faced off Saturday for a seat in the Louisiana Legislature in an election 
peppered with charges of racism and extremism. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 38, and Treen, 63, have battled for a month to represent the almost 
all-white district in Metairie, a New Orleans suburb with about 21,000 voters. 
Both are running as Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Polls made public more than a week ago showed the candidates neck-and-neck in a 
race for the state House of Representatives that attracted reporters from 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing a Duke victory and an embarrassment for the GOP, President Bush and 
former President Ronald Reagan threw their considerable weight behind Treen, a 
longtime party functionary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects Heavy Turnout 
</P>
<P>
"The prediction is there's going to be a very heavy turnout, and the polls 
indicate with a heavy turnout I'm going to win," Treen said. 
</P>
<P>
Turnout was high, with poll commissioners reached in a spot check reporting 25% 
to 43% of the people in their precincts voting in the first six hours of the 14 
hours that polls were open. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to have a very fine victory," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
Duke won 33% of the vote to lead a field of seven in the Jan. 21 primary. Treen 
got 19%. 
</P>
<P>
Under Louisiana's open primary system, the top two vote-getters in a primary, 
regardless of party, face each other in a runoff if no candidate receives more 
than half the vote. The seat opened up when Metairie's representative was 
elected to a judgeship with about three years left in a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for Klan 
</P>
<P>
The election returned the spotlight to Duke, who in the 1970s was photographed 
in a Nazi uniform and boldly removed the hood of his white robe to become an 
international spokesman for the klan. 
</P>
<P>
It is an era that Duke claimed to be sorry for, but Treen said he did not 
believe that. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret it because . . . people might think I'm racially or religiously 
intolerant," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
Duke left the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in 1980, accused by another leader of 
selling secret membership rolls. He formed the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of White People, which he says is a civil rights organization for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The final days of the race brought renewed charges that Duke still was 
associated with right-wing extremists, including ex-American Nazi leader Ralph 
Forbes of Arkansas. Duke acknowledged that Forbes had been campaign manager in 
his 1988 bid for the presidency as a member of the Populist Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attracts Few Votes 
</P>
<P>
In the general election, he ran in 15 states and drew less than .05% of the 
national total vote. 
</P>
<P>
He began his presidential bid as a Democrat but was repudiated by party 
officials. He got no delegates at the Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before qualifying for the state House race, he registered with the 
GOP, but the Republican National Committee rejected him.

HOUSE PANEL CHAIRMAN TO STEP UP PROBE OF TOWER'S GENEVA ACTIVITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of a House panel investigating the activities of Defense 
Secretary-designate John Tower as head of a U.S. disarmament-negotiating team 
in Geneva said Saturday that he will step up the inquiry after a dispute with 
the State Department over access to an investigator's reports on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), who heads an Energy and Commerce subcommittee 
investigation, said that an investigator who had flown here to discuss his 
findings on Tower was muzzled by the State Department earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell said that, although top State Department officials later assured him 
the department would cooperate with his panel's inquiry, security officers of 
the department earlier had met the investigator at a Washington airport and 
ordered him not to talk about Tower, even to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affairs Investigated 
</P>
<P>
According to subcommittee documents, U.S. investigators say that Tower had 
extramarital affairs with two secretaries while he was in Geneva. One of the 
investigators, Brian Hess of the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations, 
met with the subcommittee staff Friday after being interviewed by the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The other, Berne Indahl, a State Department security officer, arrived this 
weekend from Senegal and was supposed to see the panel early this week. It was 
Indahl who Dingell said had been instructed not to talk to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell said department officials later assured him that there had been a 
misunderstanding, but he said he intends to pursue his investigation.

LATINO: VAGUE DEFINITION CAN RAISE QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM SCHACHTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because the definition of the term Latino is vague, experts say minority 
contracting programs are rife with vendors whose status as Latinos is 
debatable. 
</P>
<P>
GTE California, for example, is reviewing the status of Doty Brothers Equipment 
Co. in Norwalk, which did $2.2 million in heavy construction work for the 
utility last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company has qualified as Latino-owned at several utilities and government 
agencies, President John T. Doty said, because his grandfather was born in 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he considered himself Hispanic, Doty acknowledged that he is "kind of 
ambivalent" about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"In thinking about the question, I can't give an answer," he said. "The only 
racial slurs ever thrown at me have been in Mexico, where I've been called a 
gringo." 
</P>
<P>
But Doty said he does not believe that he has taken advantage of the utilities' 
minority contracting programs, because he gets work only when he offers the 
best price. 
</P>
<P>
"In my experience in construction, it's the bottom line," he said. "It's 
whatever we bid." JIM SCHACHTER

A spokesman for Northeast Utilities said the release occurred while two

JOHN W. LORD; PRIEST WHO WORKED IN AIDS PROGRAM DIES OF DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County priest who had spearheaded local clergy response to AIDS 
patients has himself died of complications of AIDS after being quietly tended 
by his colleagues, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Father John W. Lord, 46, died Wednesday at the rectory of St. Columban Church 
in Garden Grove, the parish where he had lived the last six years and where he 
was known as a friendly and articulate priest, according to a spokesman for the 
Catholic Diocese of Orange. Services for Lord were held Friday night at the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"Every loss of a priest is sad," Diocese of Orange Bishop Norman F. McFarland 
said Friday. "There's also a special sadness when a young man with a great 
potential dies." 
</P>
<P>
Lord was the first priest acknowledged to have died of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in the Diocese of Orange. Catholic officials said they did 
not know, nor were they concerned with, how Lord contracted AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
McFarland said the diocese has no special policy for priests with AIDS -- a 
sensitive topic for the church because most cases are related to homosexual 
contact or intravenous drug use. About 2% of AIDS cases are attributed to blood 
transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drug Counselor 
</P>
<P>
Lord had had blood transfusions more than seven years ago, said St. Columban 
pastor Eamon O'Gorman, Lord's superior. He did not know the reason. 
</P>
<P>
Diocesan officials said the nature of Lord's disease was revealed to anyone who 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Brookline, Mass., Lord was a substance abuse counselor and church 
worker in Alaska before beginning studies to become a Paulist father at age 34. 
From 1978 to 1980, he was chaplain at St. Mark's Newman Center, serving 
students at UC Santa Barbara, then was a deacon at Good Shepherd Church in New 
York City for a year before moving west in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, before his condition was diagnosed, Lord helped spearhead the AIDS 
Ministry Ecumenical Network (AMEN), a loose-knit list of about a dozen clergy 
who volunteer to offer compassion and officiate at funerals of AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very little resources in the county at the time," said Nancy 
Radclyffe, director of the AIDS Response Program of Orange County. "There were 
probably two or three clergy heavily overworked in that area." 
</P>
<P>
He volunteered for a year until he became ill in 1987, she said.

MIKE DOWNEY: ELLIOTT SETS PAC-10 RECORD BUT IT WAS A CLOSE SHAVE 
</P>

<P>
More, more, more. Sean Elliott -- or as he apparently is known around the 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar household, Sean Who? -- kept stuffing points down UCLA's 
throats. From here. From there. From everywhere. From the cactus, man. Jams. 
Jumpers. Two-pointers. Three-pointers. And the fans in the stands yelled for 
more. And the guys on his own bench rose to their feet, salaaming him with 
their arms. Elliott could not get enough, nor could they. 
</P>
<P>
Pooh Richardson could. 
</P>
<P>
"Quit shooting," the UCLA guard told the Arizona forward. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had clued Richardson in. He had absolutely no idea that Elliott needed 
34 points Saturday to break the all-time scoring record for Pacific 10 
Conference basketball players, established practically Elliott's entire 
lifetime ago by the Big Bald Man himself, Kareem, back when everyone still knew 
him as just plain Lew. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson was every bit as oblivious of this record as Abdul-Jabbar, who, when 
interviewed by a Tucson reporter by phone, professed to know nothing about it, 
nor to have ever heard of anybody named Sean Elliott. Well, at least, he didn't 
ask if that was the guy who played James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Richardson figured out what was up. Maybe he realized what was 
happening when there were 7 minutes and 10 seconds remaining and Elliott was 
fouled, whereupon the McKale Center message scoreboard encouraged the crowd to 
"Get Rowdy." You usually don't like to request that when one of your players is 
shooting a free throw. You get quiet, not rowdy. Get rowdy during an Indiana 
free throw and Bob Knight would throw furniture at you. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, Elliott made both free throws, and the scoring record was his, and the 
first man to reach for him with a handshake was, as it turned out, Richardson, 
who certainly hadn't felt like slapping hands with any of his teammates during 
a 102-64 wipeout that became the most lopsided loss a UCLA team has ever been 
handed. This wasn't a Pac-10 game. This was a Pac-Man game. Arizona had UCLA 
for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Pooh for a while, and he's not a bad guy," Elliott said later. "I 
guess he didn't know what was going on. He said: 'Quit shooting!' And I said: 
'But I have to!' " 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who will be entering professional basketball just as Abdul-Jabbar 
leaves it, wanted the big guy's record, and his teammates wanted him to have 
it, even if it did take the Arizona player 35 more career games to get it. So, 
once it became clear Saturday that the visitors were dead meat, the Wildcats 
started clearing out for Elliott, getting out of his way, even letting him 
bring the ball up the court. He could do whatever he wanted to do, short of 
hiding the ball beneath his shirt, Meadowlark Lemon style. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the total green light," Elliott said. "I began to wonder if I could have 
come over half-court and just let it fly." 
</P>
<P>
Probably. Probably would have swished it, too. Elliott scored 35 points, 
including a half-dozen three-pointers, to give him 2,327 for his college 
career. Coach Lute Olson immediately and mercifully took Elliott out of the 
game after the record-breaking free throws, rubbed the senior's bald head (he 
has much in common with Kareem) at a mid-court ceremony following the game and 
announced to the crowd: "There's more where that came from!" Points, he means. 
</P>
<P>
The season isn't over yet, see. Arizona might still win the national 
championship. With Elliott on its side, it's definitely possible. Just be glad 
for opponents' sake that the Wildcats will not be permitted to play in their 
own regional here in Tucson, where the crowd stays on its feet at all times, 
screaming, and the world's loudest public-address announcer seems to be under 
the mistaken impression that he is Sam Kinison. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott was nervous beforehand, partly because the game was at home, and partly 
because he had been in a slump. Against USC two nights earlier, he had blown 
11-of-15 shots. He was off his game a little, and still dragging with him a 
left knee wrapped in a brace the size of a Volvo. Elliott was looking to change 
his luck. 
</P>
<P>
So, a couple of hours before game time, he went to his barber and ordered a 
complete semi-skinhead job. Like Kareem, he made himself basket-bald, giving 
himself a skull so smooth and clean, somebody could have stamped "Rawlings" on 
it and caused considerable confusion underneath the boards. 
</P>
<P>
When Arizona started killing UCLA, Elliott relaxed. The Wildcats did everything 
right. As losing Coach Jim Harrick said: "They were throwing 'em in from 
everywhere!" It got to the point that Elliott was going after a triple-double, 
since he also found time to dispense 11 assists. Everybody on the Arizona 
sidelines got into the act, with the exception of the mascot, Wilbur Wildcat, 
as UCLA fell behind by as many as 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 minutes from the end, Elliott stopped passing and started 
shooting. He missed. He missed. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
"Teasers," he called them. "Darn thing wouldn't go down." 
</P>
<P>
When Elliott passed off to Matt Othick, the teeny-weeny wittle Wildcat who 
looks as though he ought to be playing badminton instead of basketball, Othick 
passed it right back. Elliott shot from afar, but again it went in and out. He 
began to drop back. Then the ball was recovered by a teammate, who fed Elliott 
once more. He went between his legs, got fouled by Trevor Wilson, and went to 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
The free throws weren't fancy, but a record's a record. Elliott finished off 
what his coach called the greatest all-around game of his career, and impressed 
everybody, including UCLA's Wilson, who called him the best opponent he's ever 
faced. Said Wilson: "I can't think of anyone who comes close. Man to man 
defensively, I don't think anyone out there can stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott celebrated with a trophy and with a hug from his mother, Odie Elliott, 
who said: "I came about as close as I've ever come to tears at a basketball 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Glad to be out of his mini-slump as well, Elliott was asked what the biggest 
change in his game had been. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the haircut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Worked for Kareem. So who knows? A Muslim name might be next.

CLIPPERS STARTING TO WORK ON A NEW STREAK; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYING WITHOUT NORMAN, L.A. LOSES FOURTH IN ROW -- BULLETS, 98-93

The Clippers' Son of Streak aged another game Saturday night, although the 
team's growth process now comes by inches instead of miles. These games are 
considered victories of late. 
</P>
<P>
The new losing streak, after the Clippers had broken the franchise record of 19 
straight, reached four with a 98-93 loss to the Washington Bullets before a 
crowd of 11,573 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without the injured Ken Norman, their No. 1 rebounder and No. 2 scorer, 
it was the sixth time in Coach Don Casey's 13 games that the Clippers had lost 
by seven or fewer points. It was a three-point game, 96-93, with 13 seconds to 
play, before the Bullets put the game away at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about it," said Gary Grant, the rookie guard who hit six of nine 
shots in the second half, mostly on jumpers. His shots got the Clippers close 
after they trailed by 11 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel good about losing, but it's good not to get blown out. We easily 
could have won the last two games." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who shot just 35.4% in the first half, trailed by 10 going into 
the fourth quarter, 76-66. 
</P>
<P>
Despite allowing Washington several second and third opportunities on offense, 
they narrowed the gap. The Clippers never led in the fourth quarter but were 
within a point twice, the last time at 88-87 on Quintin Dailey's baseline 
jumper with 4:21 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we gave them some help," said Washington Coach Wes Unseld, whose 
Bullets won for only the fifth time in 26 road games. "Our problem is that we 
didn't get much out of our second unit. We got good shots but didn't seem to 
convert. Too many missed layups and opportunities. I think we made it tougher 
on ourselves than it had to be." 
</P>
<P>
Said Casey: "I thought for the first half it was like pulling teeth after we 
extended ourselves against Golden State (on Thursday). But we came back, mainly 
because of the energy of the young kids. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice being in every game. But it's also like a tease." 
</P>
<P>
The night began with more distractions for the Clippers -- news that a trade 
might be in the works to send Benoit Benjamin to the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same dialogue we've had for the last three months," Alan Rothenberg, 
the Clippers president, said. "But the trade deadline is coming up in a couple 
of days, and I think people are just working faster to see if a trade can be 
made." 
</P>
<P>
If it is -- and the Clippers finally part with their enigmatic center -- it may 
be because of pressure applied by Larry Fleisher, Benjamin's agent. Fleisher 
has said for weeks he does not want Benjamin to re-sign when his contract 
expires at the end of this season, and is doing everything possible to prove it 
to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Asked recently how much he would request in a new contract, Fleisher said: "Too 
much to make it worthwhile for the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
So, the Clippers, realizing that the Feb. 23 trading deadline is drawing near, 
apparently have stepped up their attempts to move Benjamin. General Manager 
Elgin Baylor said he has talked to more than 10 teams in recent days and that 
all have expressed an interest in the league's seventh-best shot blocker. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Benjamin blamed the media for any trade talk that has 
surfaced. But in contrast to the past, when he has expressed a desire to stay 
in Los Angeles, he now says that Fleisher will do all the talking. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say anything either way," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin finished as one of five Clippers to score in double figures, Charles 
Smith lead with 17 and Eric White contributing 16 off the bench in his finest 
effort this season. Grant had 14 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Malone scored 20 for Washington, and Bernard King added 18. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Clipper President Alan Rothenberg said before the game that the Clippers still 
have not been notified of the outcome of the arbitration hearing with Bill 
Walton. Gary Vandeweghe, Walton's attorney, said the decision went in favor of 
his client, although nothing has been made public. . . . Ken Norman did not 
dress because of a strained right knee, suffered Thursday against Golden State. 
Benoit Benjamin is the only Clipper to play in all 51 games. . . . The Clippers 
set a franchise record with 32 offensive rebounds in the overtime loss to 
Golden State. . . . Reggie Williams received one stitch on his lower lip after 
a third-quarter collision with Washington's John Williams and referee Joe 
Crawford. The Clipper guard, who left the game, also jammed his neck and 
developed a headache after his head hit the referee's knee.

USOC OFFICERS ELECTION DRAWS CRITICISM; 
</P>
<P>
LACK OF WOMEN SELECTED BECOMES AN ISSUE AS 6 MEN WIN SEATS 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee's House of Delegates Saturday elected six men to 
fill officer positions for the next four years, drawing criticism from women 
that the USOC is reverting to the days when it was considered an exclusive 
men's club. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most vocal was Willye White, a five-time Olympian in track and field 
from Chicago, who finished a close fourth in a four-candidate election for 
three vice presidential positions. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not about winning and losing," she said. "This was about making a 
statement. Women are part of the Olympic movement, and you cannot continue to 
ignore us." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC did not release vote totals, but sources close to the situation said 
that almost as many of the 374 delegates voted for White as for New York 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. Other vice presidents elected were Los 
Angeles attorney Michael Lenard and Colorado Springs businessman William Tutt. 
</P>
<P>
President Robert Helmick of Des Moines, Iowa, treasurer LeRoy Walker of Durham, 
N.C., and secretary Charles Foster of Duxbury, Mass., ran unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
The elected candidates were slated in November by a nominating committee, which 
included one woman among its 10 members. White was the only challenger to the 
slate. 
</P>
<P>
The nominating committee, chaired by Cincinnati attorney Ross Wales, asked 
Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation in Los Angeles and 
an International Olympic Committee member, if she would consider becoming an 
officer. She declined. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, Dr. Evie Dennis of Denver, served as a vice-president for the 
last four years, but the nominating committee did not slate her this time. 
Helmick offered her a position as special assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have any voting power, so I'll have to think about it," she said. 
"It depends on what it means, on whether I'll have any influence on what goes 
on in this organization." 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that there are only 16 women among 89 executive board members, 
Helmick appointed an ad hoc committee, chaired by two women, to identify 
potential leaders among women in Olympic sports. He also said that there will 
be four women among the 12-member administrative committee announced today.

Sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles, who won three gold medals and

USOC's SportsWoman and SportsMan of the Year.

 MORNING BRIEFING: HIS BARK LACKED USUAL BITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listening to a phone-in talk show in Philadelphia recently, Charles Barkley 
heard himself being called "mean and a ball-hog" by 76-year-old Mary Walsh, so 
he decided to set the woman straight. The 76er star hired a limousine to pick 
up Walsh, her two sons and a daughter-in-law in Trenton, N.J., and deliver them 
to the Spectrum, where they had free seats to see the 76ers against the Indiana 
Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
The two exchanged peace offerings on the court before the game, after which 
Walsh, embarrassed by the commotion, said: "Look at all the trouble (the phone 
call) got me into." 
</P>
<P>
Barkley's response: "My wife and my mama told me that I'd better shape up. They 
don't want nice ladies like you to be mad at me." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Mike Tyson, Frank Bruno -- who will seek to dethrone the heavyweight 
champion next weekend in Las Vegas -- grew up with a reputation as a big kid 
with a soft heart. 
</P>
<P>
Described by former neighbors as a "quiet and well-mannered fellow" who cared 
for wheelchair-bound senior citizens and sick children, Bruno got into his only 
real trouble when, at 11, he hit an elementary school teacher and was expelled. 
</P>
<P>
But even at Oak Hall, a reform school 50 miles southeast of London, Bruno is 
remembered for his size and his gentleness. 
</P>
<P>
"At 14, Frank was 6 feet tall and 14 stones (196 pounds) of muscle," said Sandy 
Nichols, head of child care at Oak Hall. "Other than his size, he was just like 
any other kid." 
</P>
<P>
As nursing home owner and former amateur boxer David Chapman put it: "He didn't 
fight at school because everybody was scared of him, including the staff." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, on the growing frequency with which top 
college basketball teams are beaten: "Now, not only do good teams regularly get 
beaten, but if you are fortunate enough to be ranked No. 1, you'd better Xerox 
the poll, because you're history within 24 hours. No. 1 is no longer the 
catbird seat, it's the ejection seat." 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Braves are scrapping slogans and glitz and turning to discount 
tickets to try to bring back baseball fans who apparently have drifted to other 
forms of entertainment during the last five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves drew only 848,089 fans to their home games last season, failing to 
break a million for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves began using slogans in 1983, starting with, "How Much Excitement Can 
You Stand?" That year, their last winning season, they finished 88-74. Things 
worsened in the 1984 season, billed, "You Gotta Be There." The Braves finished 
80-82. Before last season, the team decided on, "Goodness Gracious, It's One 
Crazy Summer," and finished 54-106. 
</P>
<P>
How much craziness can you stand? 
</P>
<P>
Say what?: Asked about his refusal to use his bench in Connecticut's 86-49 
blowout of Boston College's basketball team a week ago, Coach Jim Calhoun of 
the Huskies replied: "I have never run up a score and I never will." 
</P>
<P>
Add Calhoun: The Connecticut coach insisted that he did make use of the bench, 
pointing out that top scorer Cliff Robinson played only 19 minutes. Robinson, 
however, was hobbled by a sprained ankle at the time and had four fouls when he 
came out. Boston College never came closer than 25 points in the final 18 
minutes. Calhoun didn't substitute for his regulars until under four minutes 
remained in the game.

AFTER 13 STRAIGHT DEFEATS, USC'S LUCK CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
POLLARD MAKES THE BIG BASKETS IN AN 84-81 OVERTIME WIN OVER ARIZONA STATE

<P>
Even after 13 consecutive defeats, USC Coach George Raveling had faith in his 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling's belief was rewarded when Alan Pollard made a layup with 59 seconds 
remaining in overtime, lifting the Trojans to an 84-81 victory over Arizona 
State in a Pacific 10 Conference game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we were down by 14 in the first half, I wasn't worried because I've 
seen us do that and get back into the ballgame so many times this year," 
Raveling said. "If there's one thing this team has, it's heart and guts. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw two teams who are at the bottom half of the league playing their 
hearts out. It's a tribute to the conference and the coaches that two teams who 
don't have a hell of a lot to play for, play this hard to win a game." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans (8-17 overall, 1-12 in the Pac-10) overcame a 37-23 deficit late in 
the first half and forced the overtime on Pollard's jumper that tied the score, 
76-76, with 1:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State (12-12, 5-10) took an 81-78 lead 2:06 into overtime as Trent 
Edwards made a layup and turned it into a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
After Chris Moore made two free throws with 2:28 left to cut USC's deficit to 
81-80, Pollard put the Trojans ahead to stay. Chris Munk added a dunk at the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Pendleton scored 23 points for USC. Ronnie Coleman added 20, Pollard 
had 12 and Moore 11. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards scored 28 points for the Sun Devils; Alex Austin added 22, including 
six three-point shots, and freshman Ron Waller had 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought fatigue played a big part at the end because ASU's shots were 
falling short," Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the way we took Austin out of the game in the last 10 minutes. We were 
able to play the last 5 minutes of regulation and all of the overtime without 
Ronnie Coleman (who fouled out) and still win the game." 
</P>
<P>
USC was in its worst losing streak since dropping 16 consecutive games during 
the 1975-76 and 1976-77 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"The last win was March 3, 1492," Raveling quipped. "I thought we were doing 
penance -- that somewhere along the line, I must have committed a grievous sin. 
</P>
<P>
"The players have been unbelievable. I've never had a team that stuck together 
like this. There's been so many bad things said about them. People were jumping 
ship on them. I'll say this -- if we're the worst team in the league, then this 
must be a hell of a league." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State blew a lead of 55-46 5 minutes into the second half, a lead of 
73-68 with 4:21 remaining and a lead of 76-71 with 2:05 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State's interim coach, Bob Schermerhorn, 2-3 since taking over when 
Steve Patterson resigned Feb. 4, said his team made too many mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-three turnovers. It's a telling thing," Schermerhorn said. "But take 
nothing away from USC. There were 0-12 coming in here and they held together. 
It's a tribute to Coach Raveling and his staff after what they've been through. 
They kept the kids close and they finally won a ballgame. That was my worst 
fear."

Gary Payton scored 19 of his 31 points in the second half as Oregon State dealt 
Washington a 106-66 loss -- the Huskies' third-worst defeat ever -- in a 
Pacific 10 Conference game Saturday at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's 40-point losing margin was topped only by a 55-point defeat, 
116-61, at Arizona earlier this season, and a 52-point rout by UCLA in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Knox scored 22 points for the Beavers (18-5 overall, 10-4 in the Pac-10), 
while Teo Alibegovic had 17. Eldridge Recasner and Mark West scored 12 points 
each for Washington (10-14, 6-9). 
</P>
<P>
Washington State 60, Oregon 54 -- Harold Wright scored all five of his points 
and added a clutch steal in the final 36 seconds to help the Cougars down the 
Ducks at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Quinnett scored 17 points for Washington State (8-15, 3-11), and his 
basket with 8:14 left gave the Cougars a 46-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Helms had eight of his 18 points in a 22-9 run by Oregon (8-16, 3-11) that 
included 10 straight points. Helms' jumper with 1:09 left cut Washington 
State's lead to 55-54. 
</P>
<P>
Wright entered the game for the first time with 52 seconds left and made a 
three-point play with 36 seconds left, then added two free throws with 25 
seconds remaining.

<P>
HOWELL SCORES 46 POINTS, BUT TROJANS LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior guard Karon Howell scored 46 points to break a USC and Pacific 10 
Conference single-game scoring record, but it was not enough as the USC women's 
basketball team lost to Arizona, 94-84, Saturday night at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Cherie Nelson, considered the star player on the team, played only 4 minutes. 
No explanation was offered as to why Nelson didn't play more. 
</P>
<P>
Howell made 17-of-29 field-goal attempts, including six-of-12 three-point 
shots. The performance broke Cheryl Miller's four-year school record of 45 
points. Howell also broke the conference record of 45 points, set in 1987 by 
Jennifer Bennett of California. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 5-7 in the Pac-10 and 9-13 overall. Arizona is 3-9 and 8-14. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State 86, UCLA 73 -- UCLA dropped below the .500 mark in Pacific 10 
play with its loss to the Sun Devils at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The Sun Devils, who lost to the Bruins at UCLA, 85-81, in January, were led by 
guard Karen O'Conner, who scored 20 points, and forward Fran Ciak, who had 16 
points and 12 rebounds. Rochelle Roulier had 16 points for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins dropped to 5-6 in conference play and 9-12 overall, as they were 
outrebounded 54-37 by the Sun Devils. Arizona State is 3-10 and 9-14. 
</P>
<P>
CS Long Beach 91, San Diego State 80 -- Penny Toler scored 24 points to lead 
the 49ers (22-4 overall, 15-0 in the Big West Conference) over the Aztecs 
(21-5, 12-5) at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Traci Waites and Dana Wilkerson each scored 16 for the 49ers. Angelica Jackson

FULLERTON IS FORCED TO GO TO OT TO BEAT SAN JOSE STATE, 70-69

SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Desiano's shot was nothing more than a 12-foot jumper, but it made the 
Civic Auditorium crowd come alive. 
</P>
<P>
It came with 55 seconds left in San Jose State's game against Cal State 
Fullerton Saturday night, and it gave the Spartans a one-point lead, their 
first of the game. 
</P>
<P>
It also put victory into the minds of most of the crowd of 1,874, who 
ultimately were let down. San Jose State, a team made up mostly of football 
players, a team manager and assorted other walk-ons since 10 players started a 
boycott in protest of Coach Bill Berry last month, has lost its last 13 games, 
including eight since the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
This one, a 70-69 Fullerton victory in overtime, was the closest yet. Johnny 
Johnson, who as a Spartan tailback led the Big West Conference in rushing, hit 
the first of two free throws with 8 seconds left to tie the score. But he 
missed the second, and the game went to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose (5-19, 1-14) had a 69-67 lead as overtime ran down, but Fullerton's 
John Sykes rebounded Cedric Ceballos' miss in the final seconds and went up for 
a backwards dunk. An official called a foul on the play, and Sykes hit a free 
throw with 1 second remaining, saving the Titans the humiliation of becoming 
the first team to lose to San Jose State's makeshift bunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Games like this, you wish nobody lost," said Berry, whom the boycotting 
players accused of extreme verbal abuse. "Under the situation, under the 
circumstances, I may be doubly disappointed that we couldn't get over the hump 
just for the kids. I certainly could have used the boost, too." 
</P>
<P>
Craig McPherson led San Jose with 20 points. Derek Jones, who with Cedric 
Ceballos led Fullerton with 19 points, said the team had improved "maybe 100%." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans (12-11, 7-7) had to hang on to win despite shooting 56% in the game, 
their highest percentage of the season. Fullerton took a 27-13 lead at the 
outset, making 12 of its first 13 shots, with the only miss because of 
offensive basket interference. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose trailed by only three at halftime, but was down by 10 with 12 minutes 
to play.

"There are a million things you can say, 'What if, what if,' Berry said. "I'll 
be doing that tonight. I just hope (the players) don't."

EVANSVILLE'S HAFFNER SURPRISES HIMSELF BY SCORING 65 POINTS

<P>
The points kept piling up, too fast and too many for Scott Haffner to count. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't know how many I had until fairly late in the game," he said. 
"A Dayton player was at the free throw line . . .I just happened to glance into 
the crowd. One of the fans held up five fingers on one hand and one on the 
other." 
</P>
<P>
Haffner finished with 65 points -- tied for the sixth-most in a Division I game 
-- as he led Evansville over Dayton, 109-83, Saturday. His total was the 
highest in a Division I game in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Haffner made 23 of 29 shots from the field, including 11 of 13 three-pointers. 
He was 8 for 8 from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
"You just get into a groove where everything feels like it's going to go in, 
and that's what happened," Haffner said. 
</P>
<P>
Haffner, a 6-foot 4-inch senior guard, left with 1:30 remaining in the game. He 
came close to the late Pete Maravich's record of 69 points against a Division I 
opponent, set by the LSU star against Alabama in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Selvy of Furman scored an all-time record 100 points against Newberry on 
Feb. 13, 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Haffner was averaging 22 points a game and 54% shooting from the field. He 
started quickly against Dayton (11-12 overall, 6-4 in the Midwestern Collegiate 
Conference), scoring 14 in the first six minutes. He had 30 in the first half, 
including a jump shot at the buzzer that put Evansville ahead, 54-35. 
</P>
<P>
Haffner scored 35 more in the second half, leading Evansville to its 33rd 
straight home win. The Purple Aces (20-3) clinched at least a tie for the MCC 
title at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the greatest offensive performance I've ever seen," Evansville Coach 
Jim Crews said. "I saw Bill Walton hit 21 of 22 shots, but those were chip 
shots compared to what Scott was shooting. He cut well all day. He used the 
screens that his teammates set. He was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Haffner broke the school record of 48 points set by Larry Humes against Ball 
State in 1965 and the MCC mark of 54 by Butler's Darrin Fitzgerald against 
Detroit in 1987.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
REVITALIZED WISCONSIN SHUTS DOWN NO. 5 ILLINOIS, 72-52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Trent Jackson and the Wisconsin Badgers can finally take a winning season off 
their wish list. 
</P>
<P>
They took care of that Saturday by routing fifth-ranked Illinois, 72-52, in a 
Big Ten game at Madison, Wis., to clinch the school's first winning season in 
nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the list is a tournament bid. That has been even more rare than a 
winning season. The Badgers haven't received a postseason invitation since 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big victory for the team," said Jackson, who made five three-pointers 
and 10 of 15 shots to score 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes us one giant step closer to making it to the NCAA tournament, which 
has been our season-long goal." 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers held a 32-18 halftime lead, and cold-shooting Illinois never got 
closer than 12 points in the second half. Jackson's jumper with 13:10 to go 
gave the Badgers a 47-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Badgers are 15-7 overall and 7-6 in the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois (21-4, 8-4) couldn't solve the Badgers' collapsing defense. Averaging 
88 points entering the game, the Illini were held 10 points below their 
previous season low. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Coach Lou Henson said the Badgers, who earlier in the season were 
hoping for a National Invitation Tournament bid, have a chance to earn a 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. bid. In addition to Illinois, their other 
homecourt victims include Michigan and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Jones had 17 points for Wisconsin, and Tim Locum, who had four 
three-point baskets, scored 12. The Badgers lost to Illinois by 23 points 
earlier this season, and Saturday's victory was their first in the last 17 
games against the Illini. 
</P>
<P>
"Trent had one of his finest days in a Badger uniform," Coach Steve Yoder said. 
"It's a big game for us, but everybody is talking about the tournament and 
there is no tournament for us if we don't keep winning. If you keep winning, 
you earn that right to go. That's what we have to do. We got our 15th win and 
that's not going to get you there." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma 106, Colorado 88 -- Stacey King scored 23 of his 28 points in the 
second half to help the top-ranked Sooners win the Big Eight game at Boulder, 
Colo. 
</P>
<P>
King scored four points and Mookie Blaylock had seven, helping Oklahoma take a 
24-8 lead, and the Sooners (23-3, 9-1) never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado (7-16, 2-6) cut the lead to 26-16 with 8:37 to go in the half, but 
Oklahoma surged to a 37-21 lead on a 3-point basket by Terrance Mullins with 
5:50 left. The Sooners led, 46-35, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
King helped Oklahoma build its lead in the second half, scoring the basket that 
gave the Sooners their biggest advantage, 101-78, with 2:41 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 102, Kansas 77 -- Danny Ferry had his jersey retired in pregame ceremonies 
at Durham, N.C., then scored 20 of his 26 points in the first half as the No. 
11 Blue Devils extended their winning streak to five games with an easy victory 
over the Jayhawks, who lost for the seventh consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas shot 55% in the first half, but the Blue Devils forced 15 turnovers, 
shot 62.9% and used an 11-3 run to start the runaway that helped raised their 
record to 19-4. 
</P>
<P>
Duke led, 53-34, at halftime and extended the lead to as much as 27 points 
before Kansas (16-10) scored the game's final basket. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown 80, Boston College 69 -- The No. 4 Hoyas limited the Eagles to one 
basket in the final 5 1/2 minutes to easily win the Big East game at Newton, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown (20-3, 10-2) also used excellent free throw shooting down the 
stretch, making the front ends of their last eight one-and-one situations. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College (9-13, 1-10) was led by Dana Barros with 23, including five 
three-pointers. Barros' three-point basket with 5:38 left cut the lead to 
63-61. Barros extended his streak of games with at least one three-pointer to 
63. That was the last field goal for the Eagles until Steve Benton's layup with 
51 seconds left, making the score 76-69. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse 87, Providence 80 -- Derrick Coleman scored 22 points and led a late 
surge that carried the No. 6 Orangemen to their 20th consecutive victory over 
the Friars in a Big East game at Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (22-5 overall, 8-5 in the Big East), has never lost a conference game 
against Providence (17-6, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
Marty Conlon, who scored a career-high 29 points for Providence, made two free 
throws to tie it, 72-72. But Coleman, playing the last seven minutes with four 
fouls, scored five points as Syracuse took a 79-74 lead with 4:42 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 89, Florida State 78 -- Elliot Perry scored 24 points and Ernest 
Smith added 22 to lead the Tigers to their second victory over the No. 7 
Seminoles in a Metro Conference game at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second disappointing defeat for the Seminoles (19-4, 7-3) in three 
days. They lost to Louisville, 78-77, in overtime Thursday night. The Tigers 
beat them, 99-82, in Tallahassee Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State (19-8, 6-3) maintained a fast pace and held the lead through most 
of the game. The Tigers twice took leads of 22 points in the second period, the 
last at 71-49 with 8:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsurgh 82, Seton Hall 76 -- The Panthers continued their mastery over ranked 
teams at home as Brian Shorter scored 26 points and Jason Matthews had 22 to 
lead Pitt to the Big East victory over the No. 14 Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers, who upset the then-No. 9 Pirates, 82-79, Jan. 28, overcame Ramon 
Ramos' 25 points for their fifth victory over a Top 20 team this season. Pitt 
earlier beat Oklahoma, Syracuse, Seton Hall and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews made six consecutive free throws down the stretch as the Panthers 
(14-10, 7-6) made 12 in a row in the final 2:14 of play until Rod Brookin 
missed a free throw with 16 seconds left. Pitt made 18 of 20 second-half free 
throws and 26 of 29 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt, which squandered an early nine-point lead when Seton Hall (21-5, 8-5) 
scored 15 consecutive points, took the lead for good when Shorter's layup with 
12:54 to play started the Panthers on a 7-0 run that made it 56-50. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa 99, Minnesota 61 -- Matt Bullard scored 20 points and Roy Marble added 19 
at Iowa City, Iowa, to help the No. 15 Hawkeyes hand the Gophers their 12th 
consecutive Big Ten road defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa (19-6, 7-5) also avenged an 80-78 loss to Minnesota (14-8, 6-6) earlier 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Bullard, a 6-foot-10 transfer from Colorado, had his finest game since a knee 
injury put him out of the lineup seven games into the season. Playing with a 
brace on his left knee, he scored 14 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
Iowa led, 45-33, at halftime and outscored Minnesota, 16-6, at the start of the 
second half to take a 61-39 lead with 13:19 to play, and Minnesota never came 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern 70, Ohio State 69 -- Brian Schwabe made a free throw with 4 
seconds left to give the Wildcats the Big Ten upset over the No. 16 Buckeyes at 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State was playing its first game without leading scorer Jay Burson, whose 
college career ended with a neck injury suffered Monday night against Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Lambiotte scored 23 points for Northwestern (9-14, 2-11), which overcame 
a 16-point deficit in the final eight minutes. Perry Carter scored 25 points 
for Ohio State (17-8, 6-6). 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 71, Georgia Tech 69 -- Rodney Monroe's two free throws 
with 14 seconds left gave the No. 19 Wolfpack the Atlantic Coast Conference 
victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The game's start was delayed about 15 minutes because snow and ice delayed 
North Carolina State's departure from Raleigh. The Wolfpack had only a 
10-minute warmup before the delayed tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the Wolfpack (17-5 overall), in first place in the ACC at 8-2. 
The Yellow Jackets (17-8, 6-4) played without starting forward Tom Hammonds, 
who has a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech tied the score, 69-69, with seven consecutive points, capped by 
Brian Oliver's two free throws with a minute left. Oliver had a chance to tie 
the score again with one second left, but missed both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt 108, Louisiana State 74 -- Barry Goheen scored 23 points and Barry 
Booker added 21 as the Commodores handed the No. 20 Tigers their worst loss of 
the season in the Southeastern Conference game at Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (16-10, 10-4) led by five points at halftime and then pulled away 
behind Goheen's 17 points in the second half. LSU (18-7, 10-4) was led by 
freshman Chris Jackson, who scored 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Commodores opened the second half with a 23-11 run, 10 by Goheen, for a 
64-47 lead. Jackson tried to rally LSU with 13 points in the next 4 1/2 minutes 
to cut the margin to 72-65. But he was shut out in the final 9:16, and 
Vanderbilt broke the game open with a 17-0 run that made it 98-70 with 2:39 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama 71, Kentucky 67 -- Michael Ansley scored 24 points and had 14 rebounds 
at Lexington, Ky., to help the Crimson Tide hand the Wildcats their fifth 
straight defeat in the SEC game at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
It's the first time Kentucky (11-15, 6-8) has lost five in a row since 1924-25, 
when the Wildcats opened the season with five defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Horry gave Alabama (17-6, 9-5) the lead for good, 64-62, on a 12-footer 
with 2:53 left. Kentucky's Reggie Hanson made a free throw, but Ansley made a 
jumper and David Benoit a dunk to give the Tide a 68-63 lead with 1:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
Florida 99, Tennessee 81 -- Dwayne Schintzius made 12 of 13 shots and finished 
with 27 points at Gainesville, Fla., to lead the Gators to their eighth 
straight SEC win. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston Chatman added 19 points, Renaldo Garcia had 17 and Clifford Lett 
scored 16 as the Gators (16-10, 10-4) won for the eighth time in nine games 
since losing to Tennessee Jan. 18 at Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
Schintzius, who made seven of eight shots in the first half and all five 
attempts after halftime, also had 11 rebounds. Florida's defense keyed a rally 
from a 10-point first-half deficit and held Dyron Nix, the SEC's third-leading 
scorer with a 23-point average, to eight points on four of 15 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Clarence Swearengen scored 20 points for Tennessee (15-8, 8-6).

ASBURY UNHAPPY AS PEPPERDINE ROLLS PAST PORTLAND, 86-68 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although Pepperdine defeated Portland, 86-68, Saturday night, Coach Tom Asbury 
wasn't particularly pleased with the way his team played. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves, looking sluggish at times, had a difficult time shaking off Portland 
before 3,029 fans at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Simply, Asbury didn't think his players were trying very much. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said some of his players thought "they would show up, put the uniforms 
on and win" against the Pilots, the seventh-place team in the West Coast 
Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
But Portland, which fell to 2-23 overall and 2-10 in the conference, didn't 
play like an also-ran. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Waves didn't look like a first-place team, they improved to 18-9 
and 10-2. They remain in a first-place tie with St. Mary's. The Gaels (22-3, 
10-2) defeated the University of San Diego Saturday night in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Pepperdine nor Portland played much defense in the first half. The 
teams kept trading baskets and leads through the first 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Johnson, who finished with a game-high 27 points, made one of his seven 
three-point baskets, giving the Pilots a 38-37 lead with 4:53 remaining in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
But Rick Welch answered with a three-pointer, starting an 11-0 run that gave 
Pepperdine a 48-38 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves may have thought that they had shaken Portland at that point, but 
they hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
The teams went back to trading baskets in the second half, but the balance of 
trade began shifting to Pepperdine little by little. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves may have thought they had put away the Pilots when Shann Ferch made a 
three-pointer, giving Pepperdine a 68-51 lead at 9:48. But they hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
Portland fashioned an 11-0 run of its own, one that included a three-pointer 
and a layup by Johnson, who was 10 of 15 from the field and seven of nine from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Lewis, who finished with 16 points despite a badly bruised shooting 
arm, hit a 15-foot jumper that ignited a 12-0 spurt by the Waves. When that run 
ended, the Waves led, 80-62, with 1:54 left, and there was no more fight left 
in the Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Lewis and Dexter Howard, who scored a team-high 20 points, had 
obviously been hampered by injuries. Lewis had hurt his right arm in one of 
last week's games, and Howard had sprained his right index finger in practice 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time of year when you have a lot of aches and dings," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that it is also a good time of year for Pepperdine to bear down 
and "play a little bit better from here on out." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury did praise Casey Crawford and Craig Davis. Crawford had nine points and 
a game-high 15 rebounds. Davis scored 19 points and was seven of 11 from the 
field and four of six from three-point range.

SERVICE WINS ALL-AROUND TITLE AS BRUIN GYMNASTS TAKE OWN MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOFFER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tanya Service recovered from a motorcycle spill on Monday to win the all-around 
on Saturday and help the Bruins gain their third straight UCLA-Times Women's 
Gymnastics Invitational title, thus moving from uneasy rider to easy glider in 
less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
She scored an invitational record 38.85 in the all-around, including another 
meet record of 9.85 on floor exercises, to keep Bruin dominance alive in this 
event. "Our first peak of the year," said UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who have won 23 straight dual meets but never an NCAA championship 
(third last year), had a team score of 190.95 points(another record) to easily 
beat Cal State Fullerton (188.2) and Arizona State (188.15). Georgia was fourth 
(187.50) and Stanford was fifth (183.65). 
</P>
<P>
For Service, who missed competing in the NCAA championships last year when she 
dislocated her elbow in the regionals, this week's developments were very 
encouraging. Usually when she gets injured, it is in competition. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was riding on the back of boyfriend (and UCLA men's gymnast) Mike 
Chaplin's motor scooter when they were rear-ended. "Lower back whiplash," she 
explained after the Pauley Pavilion meet. "It still hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Not that anybody noticed. College gymnastics best athlete never to win an NCAA 
title sailed through the meet, capping it off with a crisp floor exercise 
routine. Her record-breaking score was helped by teammate Shawn McGinnis, 
another oft-injured gymnast, who threw what was announced as college gymnastics 
first "full-in." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it was the second. McGinnis had done the double-twisting double-back 
somersault in a dual meet with Cal State Fullerton. "But they weren't sure it 
was the first at the time," she said. "So I guess I'm still the first." 
</P>
<P>
Her routine earned her a 9.80, which tied the record. But it only stood for 
minutes until Service followed with hers, nothing as spectacular but possibly 
more polished. 
</P>
<P>
Service, who had won the all-around in this same meet two years ago with a 
record score of 38.60, beat Arizona State's Karli Urban (38.40) and teammate 
McGinnis (38.30). UCLA's Jill Andrews and Cal State Fullerton's Liso Dolan tied 
for fourth with 37.90. 
</P>
<P>
Tomlinson said his team, which normally performs in the John Wooden Center, was 
a "little bit hyper" in its once-a-year Pauley Pavilion performance. "Our bars 
performance was hyperness," he said of some uneven scoring.

Lars-Boerje Eriksson became the first Swede to win a speed race on the World 
Cup skiing tour by winning a men's World Cup super giant slalom by a 
three-hundredths of a second over West Germany's Markus Wasmeier. 
</P>
<P>
Swedish skiers have never excelled in downhill or super-G because of the lack 
of long, steep slopes in Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
Eriksson earned his first World Cup victory in 1 minute 17.98 seconds. Wasmeier 
finished in 1:18.01, and Helmut Mayer of Austria was third in 1:18.29. A giant 
slalom is scheduled today.

CCAA TOURNAMENT MAY NOT BE ON TV

An advertising division of the Los Angeles Lakers does not have an agreement 
with Prime Ticket to broadcast the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
postseason tournament March 4 and may have misrepresented that fact to 
conference officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sportsworks, an arm of California Sports Inc., parent company of the Lakers, 
approached the conference in October for the right to package a broadcast of 
the men's and women's championship games. From the beginning, said CCAA 
Commissioner Tom Morgan, Sportsworks made it clear that it had already secured 
air time on the Prime Ticket cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Don Corsene, Prime Ticket vice president of programming and 
production, said he has never heard of Sportsworks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are booked through April, so there is no way that it will be on, even on 
tape delay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Crossland of Sportsworks said a person in her firm secured air time for 
the games on Prime Ticket on a tape-delayed basis. But she was not sure whether 
a Los Angeles-area station would carry the games. Six of the eight schools in 
the CCAA are serviced by L.A. television stations. 
</P>
<P>
CCAA President Ken Walker of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, in charge of the TV 
negotiations, did not return several phone calls. PAUL McLEOD

PROBLEMS NAG AT PARK PARTHENIA'S SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Guadalupe Aguilar, life in the Bryant-Vanalden area of Northridge has 
vastly improved since the city of Los Angeles began an unprecedented project 
three years ago to rid the mostly poor Latino neighborhood of crime and 
unsightly conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, this apartment is magnificent. It's clean and beautiful," she said 
from her comfortable, newly carpeted and freshly painted unit. "We are happy." 
</P>
<P>
But for her neighbor, Oscar Torres, and perhaps as many as 150 others, city 
promises of safe, decent housing are unfulfilled, interviews with city 
officials and more than 30 tenants has found. 
</P>
<P>
Torres lives in an unheated, roach-infested unit. His carpet is tattered and 
severe bathroom plumbing problems have so rotted his floors that they squish 
like a wet sponge when he walks on them. His oven does not work. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot was promised to us, but in reality there has been little for me," said 
Torres, 45, a landscape worker. "Look at my apartment. For me it has been 
lies." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the $25-million redevelopment project -- the largest of it 
kind undertaken by the city -- is nearly complete. They describe it, in 
general, as a success and see it as a model for crime-ridden, run-down areas in 
other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is down. Streets are cleaner. A new coat of paint covers the exterior of 
the once graffiti-marred cluster of 60 apartment buildings, which has been 
renamed Park Parthenia. And hundreds of poor immigrant families live in decent 
housing -- paying less rent to boot. 
</P>
<P>
But when pressed, city officials concede that poor conditions remain in some 
units. Walter Clarke, rehabilitation manager for the Community Development 
Department, said all violations of health and safety codes will be corrected 
after the city does its final inspection of the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disparities Remain 
</P>
<P>
Clarke acknowledged that even if those violations are resolved, disparities 
will remain in living conditions because the city and developer underestimated 
the amount of work necessary and have nearly run out of rehabilitation money. 
</P>
<P>
The project was approved by the City Council and Mayor Tom Bradley in November, 
1986. Its purpose was to transform the blighted three-block stretch of 
apartment buildings into a well-groomed development that would be more in 
keeping with the fashionable Northridge community that surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Councilman Hal Bernson, in whose district the project is located, 
had proposed cleaning up the area by making it easier to evict the 
predominantly low-income Latino tenants so that a "new class of tenants" could 
be brought in. He abandoned the proposal because of a threatened veto by 
Bradley and intense protests from civil rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
A second plan, eventually approved, provided developer Devinder Vadehra with 
$20.6 million from tax-exempt bonds and a $4.8-million loan to buy and fix up 
453 apartments in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
To date all but 19 of the 453 apartments have been renovated, according to a 
spokeswoman for the developer, and work is beginning on the remaining units. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have ever done anything positive in the housing area in this city, this 
is it," Bernson said. "We took an terrible situation, and we turned it around." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the area accounted for nearly one third of drug-related arrests in the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. In 1988, the area had only 
57 of the 1,505 drug-related arrests in the division. 
</P>
<P>
John McClure, principal of Napa Street Elementary School next to the project, 
said the redevelopment has "gotten rid of the drugs and the violence that used 
to take place out in front of our school. There is not the fear element that 
many residents dealt with previously." 
</P>
<P>
Jeri Jackola, who has lived in the area for 30 years agreed that 
Bryant-Vanalden "has been cleaned up considerably. But I still think there is 
more work that needs to be done. I'd like to see the greenbelt," referring to a 
landscape plan that officials said was scrapped for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
A city official who worked closely on the project said he likes some of the 
results but believes "the price was disproportionately high, economically. I 
think the social price was, too. I don't like the feeling that we took 
somebody's neighborhood and destroyed it," said the official, who requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Strict rules have been established for residents. For instance, children are 
prohibited from playing in public areas such as courtyards and hallways. 
Pushcart vendors are banned. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the turnover among tenants ended many longtime friendships. "Most of my 
neighbors, my friends are gone," said Angela Arragon, 54, a 10-year resident 
who is happy with the improvements to her apartment. "There is no more 
community here." 
</P>
<P>
There are now about 1,600 tenants in the 453 apartments, down from an estimated 
4,000 in 1985, when city officials found families doubling and tripling up. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the apartments are occupied by residents receiving federal 
Section 8 rent subsidies, under which they pay 30% of their income toward rent 
and the government picks up the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we needed two other families to pay" the $650 monthly rent for a 
three-bedroom apartment, said Carmen Chavez, 33. The mother of four who works 
as a housekeeper said she now pays $193 of her own money for a two-bedroom 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opinions Differ 
</P>
<P>
"It is a good feeling for me to be able to pay all my bills every month," 
Chavez said. "And it is better for the children to sleep in their own room." 
</P>
<P>
But many tenants have a different view of the project. They complain that 
repeated requests for repairs and improvements have gone unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
Those tenants are living in apartments without such basic necessities as 
working heaters and stoves. Besides walls and floors rotted by plumbing 
problems, some apartments have tattered carpets and kitchen floors that are 
worn to cement foundations. 
</P>
<P>
The number of apartments with poor conditions could not be determined. A random 
check of 30 units by The Times found 17 with apparent code violations. In every 
case the tenant had not sought a rent subsidy, which meant the apartment did 
not have to pass strict inspections by federal housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of work is poorer in many of the 150 units rented to unsubsidized 
tenants because those apartments were given lower priority in the 
redevelopment, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Top priority went to units the developer hoped would attract middle-class 
tenants or to units that would house tenants with rent subsidies, he said. 
Rent-subsidized tenants received apartments upgraded with such items as new 
appliances, carpet and kitchen floors because they had to pass "a higher 
standard of inspection by housing authorities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A major contributing factor, city officials said, was that the city and 
developer had underestimated the amount of work required and did not have 
enough money to improve all units equally. 
</P>
<P>
"We never intended to turn it into a Leisure World," said Ralph Esparza, 
director of the Community Development Department's housing division. "It's 
basically safe, decent and affordable housing. That was our objective."

U.S. SAYS IT TAPPED CALLS OF PALESTINIAN DEFENDANTS, LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A clandestine arm of the federal judiciary eavesdropped on telephone 
conversations between Los Angeles-area Palestinians charged with subversion and 
visa violations and their attorneys who are fighting to keep them from being 
deported, the government has disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
In revealing the surveillance, the Justice Department said, in effect, that no 
constitutional rights were violated because "none of those conversations 
involve privileged attorney-client communications." 
</P>
<P>
The lead attorney for the Palestinians, Dan Stormer of Los Angeles, branded the 
surveillance "unlawful." He said defense lawyers will make an effort in federal 
court to force the government to produce information that laid the foundation 
for the wire taps. 
</P>
<P>
But the government said such exhibits must remain sealed because they "contain 
extremely significant documents concerning sensitive intelligence sources and 
methods used by U.S. intelligence agencies (and) would damage the national 
security of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
Stormer charged that the government misused its eavesdropping powers, 
authorized under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, when it tapped 
the Palestinians' phones and picked up conversations with their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
"Under common law, the Constitution's Sixth Amendment (which spells out the 
rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions) and state and federal evidence 
codes, the conversations between an attorney and a client are protected," 
Stormer said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the Surveillance Act is aimed at individuals involved in 
criminal activity and "acting on behalf of a foreign power. Our clients have 
not engaged in any unlawful acts. They've only engaged in their First Amendment 
right of freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department memorandums, which also described the use of informants 
and video taping of one of the defendants, were filed last week in U.S. 
Immigration Court in Los Angeles in response to requests by defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokeswoman said Saturday that the department will have no 
further comment on the surveillance disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
The volatile case, which pits the Justice Department against civil rights and 
Arab-American groups, involves eight aliens who were accused under the 
McCarran-Walter Act of belonging to a Marxist faction of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization with a history of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
All eight -- seven Palestinians and a Kenyan -- have denied membership in the 
faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). None were 
charged with any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers raised the surveillance issue in June, 1987, in an Immigration 
Court filing alleging that they and their clients "have experienced unusual and 
inexplicable noises and clicking sounds during their telephone conversations." 
</P>
<P>
The government filings do not say whether the aliens are still under 
surveillance or how many conversations were monitored. 
</P>
<P>
The wiretaps were authorized under the Carter Administration law designed to 
allow covert gathering of information for national security purposes. Wiretap 
orders were issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which 
operates in a closely guarded courtroom in the main Justice Department building 
in Washington, which is closed to defendants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began in 1985 
</P>
<P>
In the government papers, a U.S. immigration attorney, Michael P. Lindemann, 
said the FBI carried out the surveillance as far back as July 31, 1985, when it 
began recording the telephone numbers called by one of the defendants, Julie 
Mungai, 30. She is the Kenyan-born wife of Khader Hamide, 34, of Los Angeles, 
one of the case's two leading defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Lindemann said in a declaration, government lawyers "viewed a 
brief portion of one video tape, without sound, taken in the course of one 
surveillance." 
</P>
<P>
Government memorandums said that monitoring also took place by "consensual 
electronic surveillance," which involves the use of informants. 
</P>
<P>
Lindemann said "that while attorneys of record in this case have been 
overheard" talking to the Palestinians, whose phones were tapped, "only a 
single conversation was in connection with this case, and that single 
conversation did not involve attorney-client communication and was not 
otherwise privileged." In any case, he said, the material would not be used in 
the deportation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deportations Delayed 
</P>
<P>
Although the eight aliens were arrested and briefly jailed in January, 1987, 
legal maneuvering has delayed their deportation proceedings, now scheduled to 
resume in May. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against six of the eight have been reduced to miscellaneous visa 
violations; and proceedings against two of these six were then halted when it 
appeared that they would be granted amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
But deportation hearings are scheduled to proceed against two of the 
Palestinians whom the government alleged are local PFLP leaders -- Hamide and 
Michel Shehadeh, 32, of Long Beach. Both have been charged under 
McCarran-Walter with "unlawful damage, injury or destruction of property." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the government's case, however, is a major free-speech decision 
last December in Los Angeles by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who 
ruled that the McCarran-Walter Act's political provisions were 
unconstitutional. The government is expected to appeal.

L.A. CHILDREN'S MUSEUM BURGLARIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Children's Museum was burglarized sometime Friday night, the 
third time since November that the facility has been broken into. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest break-in, a burglar threw rocks through a 15-foot-high office 
window on the building's west side. About $3,000 in office equipment was 
stolen, including five typewriters and a computer terminal, said museum 
spokeswoman Tisa Armendarez. 
</P>
<P>
Armendarez said the nonprofit organization has been unable to afford a burglar 
alarm system for the large building at 310 N. Main St. 
</P>
<P>
This latest burglar apparently left no fingerprints and no one in the area 
reported seeing anything suspicious, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Barry Staggs said.

CRITICS CONTEND THE FIRM NEEDS TO REGAIN VISION THAT CREATED THE MACINTOSH

CUPERTINO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year is 2000, and Prof. Bradford in Berkeley is desperately trying to pull 
together a last-minute lecture on deforestation of the Amazon for his 4:15 
class. He flips on his notebook-sized computer and starts talking, ordering 
libraries of research papers, a few animated charts and even some help directly 
from a colleague across the country. 
</P>
<P>
The computer, a revolutionary device by any standard, doesn't exist today 
except in a slick, six-minute video produced by Apple Computer Inc. to 
illustrate what Chairman John Sculley calls a vision of "my technology" for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at Apple's corporate campus, which resembles nothing less than a 
yuppie theme park for bright young MBAs and computer engineers, the technology 
powering the company's awesome spurt to a $5-billion-a-year operation isn't 
significantly different from the original Macintosh personal computer Apple 
introduced five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies Apple's central dilemma: It wants to get to the 21st Century 
with real revolutionary products, not merely "vision rollouts" of devices such 
as Prof. Bradford's "Knowledge Navigator" computer in a notebook. But at the 
same time, analysts say, it seems reluctant -- or perhaps unable -- to break 
away from the Macintosh and go beyond simply refining a hit product line. 
</P>
<P>
Similar challenges face other high-tech companies, but it is keenly felt 
especially at Apple because the stakes go far beyond the traditional methods of 
score-keeping, such as sales, earnings and market share. Perhaps more important 
to many inside the company is the desire to protect the company's 
well-burnished reputation for risk taking, visionary spirit and technological 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
But so far Apple has failed to satisfy even some of its staunchest supporters 
that its technology goals will have a life much beyond videotape. And some 
observers are not sure that the company even wants to break out of the comfort 
of the Mac pack. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there were more science and less science fiction," complains Richard A. 
Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter. "I don't have any sense from 
Apple that there is the great vision from the top." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Esther Dyson, a software newsletter publisher: "I get the sense that the 
top management doesn't even agree on what has to be done. . . . I want them to 
do well, but I can't produce any credible evidence that they will." 
</P>
<P>
Pretty harsh criticism for a company whose sales have doubled since 1986 and 
whose very name is synonymous in high-tech circles for what Apple co-founder 
Steven Jobs called "insanely great" products and a bold view of the future. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, responds Sculley, it's unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple is a company that gets measured on a different yardstick," says the 
intense 49-year-old chairman who joined Apple five years ago after being wooed 
away from the presidency of Pepsi Cola. 
</P>
<P>
"Apple is talked about as though it lives on the edge of reality. People expect 
it to have superhuman powers. But the fact is that we are mere mortals." 
</P>
<P>
And the mortals at Apple these days, explains Sculley, are interested in 
pursuing an evolutionary rather than revolutionary strategy. Translated into 
action, this means that Apple will continue to make incremental improvements to 
its existing Macintosh system, a line whose sales total nearly 3 million 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
In the marketing world, where Sculley blazed trails while at Pepsi in the 1960s 
and '70s, this approach is called "line extension": the creation of a family of 
vaguely similar products (i.e., cola, cherry cola, diet cola, caffeine-free 
cola) to appeal to the broadest audience. 
</P>
<P>
Transferred to the world of high tech, the approach has produced a series of 
improvements to the Macintosh, not one of which radically stands out, but which 
together have produced a broadly accepted personal computer, widely considered 
to be the easiest and most enjoyable to use of the machines available. 
</P>
<P>
Does it matter to Sculley that the basic Macintosh technology was developed in 
the early half of the 1980s by a team of engineers led by Jobs, who left Apple 
in 1985, and that his own leadership has produced nothing of the magnitude of 
Jobs' contribution? 
</P>
<P>
No, not really. Sculley says there's more to running a high-tech company than 
far-out technology and state-of-the-art wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
"People would like it if we could come up with something so revolutionary that 
they would gasp," he explains. "But then the Macintosh would be immediately 
obsolete. And we have had too much success with the Mac to do that. We have to 
do it with incremental innovations." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wall Street Wary 
</P>
<P>
But incremental innovations might not be enough. Market researchers and Wall 
Street analysts say they are growing increasingly concerned that the key 
competitive edge the Macintosh has long enjoyed over its PC competitors -- 
namely its easy-to-use features -- is fast disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Presentation Manager, a software program developed by IBM and Microsoft for IBM 
personal computers offers users some of the same easily understood graphics 
features originally introduced on the Macintosh. As the product gains 
acceptance, many fear that the Macintosh technology will lose much of its 
luster. 
</P>
<P>
"People won't dump their Macs because of it," says Dyson, the newsletter 
publisher. "But if they want the latest system, they might go with IBM." 
</P>
<P>
Although Apple has introduced two pieces of technology that enhance the 
capabilities of the Macintosh -- including an indexing system called HyperCard 
and the Hyper TV video system -- neither has a proven appeal for the general 
office user, the person for whom the vast majority of computer purchases are 
made. And neither is considered sufficiently exciting to prop up the value of 
the Mac's graphic features. 
</P>
<P>
But even more disturbing, Dyson says, is her sense that Apple executives don't 
seem concerned by the looming competition. "It's hard to tell whether they have 
even recognized this threat," she says. "I get conflicting senses of direction 
from the top managers." 
</P>
<P>
Apple's top executives, installed during two thorough corporate reorganizations 
in the past few years, are also a concern to other outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly have some doubts," says Bruce Lupatkin, a high-technology analyst 
for Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco brokerage. "I'd like to see the 
results of all the reorganizations and product development work . . . . I want 
to know if all the right people are in the right management slots now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chip Shortage Blamed 
</P>
<P>
Lupatkin says his growing concerns about the company prompted him to stop 
recommending the stock to clients about a month ago. Apple stock has been 
hovering in recent weeks in the mid- to high-$30s, down from a 52-week high of 
$47.75 late last year. 
</P>
<P>
He is particularly concerned about the company's announcement last month that 
earnings for its quarter ending March 30 could be as much as 42% lower than 
they were a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company blames the projected decline on its peak-price purchase last summer 
of shortage-plagued memory chips and a subsequent decision -- since reversed -- 
to increase Macintosh prices to cover the higher chip prices. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, at least three other investment houses issued negative comments 
about Apple. Montgomery Securities, lowered its rating of the stock to 
"neutral"; Prudential-Bache cut its earnings estimate for the company, and a 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst was quoting as saying he is concerned that 
the company is losing some of its competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
The investment analysts' comments came in response to Apple's decision last 
week to offer rebates to spur sales of its products. The annoucement was viewed 
as yet more evidence that the company's profits will be squeezed this year. 
</P>
<P>
Lupatkin and others question whether top management -- particularly Sculley, 
who was on a much publicized sabbatical last summer -- was paying sufficient 
attention to operating details. "I think there was a breakdown, no matter what 
the company insists," Lupatkin says. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Sculley says there was little he or anyone at the company could 
have done, given the tight market for dynamic random access memory chips last 
year. Now, he says, the company is back on course. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not necessarily any reason to cheer, says Stewart Alsop II, 
publisher of a personal computer newsletter. Alsop has repeatedly criticized 
Apple's product development efforts and singles out the company's long-delayed 
introduction of a Macintosh laptop model, now scheduled for unveiling later 
this year, as an example of the company's product problems. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no basic leadership in product design," he says. "Is it legitimate to 
have a product like the laptop under development for two years, when the 
world's basic understanding of computer technology changes every nine to 18 
months? They should cancel the product right now and start over. It won't be 
the right product when it comes out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diamond Earring 
</P>
<P>
Others question whether Apple has even fully exploited the potential of the 
Macintosh. For example, one analyst notes that HyperCard, a unique and 
sophisticated indexing system, is ideal for database management requirements of 
businesses. But the company, he claims, may be losing that market to inferior 
systems because it has failed to move quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Often singled out for criticism is Jean-Louis Gassee, president of Apple 
Products and the man ultimately responsible for new product development. 
Critics sneer that Gassee, the former head of Apple's marketing effort in 
France, has gotten as far as he has because he rhapsodizes philosophical with a 
French accent and wears a single diamond earring. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs around talking philosophical, but basically his job is to provide 
products that people want to buy," says one critic who asks to remain 
anonymous. "But in 3 1/2 years on the job, he's introduced four products." 
</P>
<P>
Sculley, who has blamed the laptop delay on inadequate technology for the 
screen resolution, fiercely defends Gassee and his product introductions. He 
says more than 50% of Apple's revenue has come from new products during 
Gassee's tenure at the helm of the product research operation, an achievement 
he calls "an extraordinary record of success." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sculley admits that Gassee has his critics. "He loves to be very 
French; he loves to bathe his language in a thick French accent. He's 
controversial, but he's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
If that excitement can be translated into a steady stream of innovative 
products that ultimately creates the "Knowledge Navigator" -- or something 
close to it -- is still another question. 
</P>
<P>
And there'll be no quick answer. According to Chris Espinosa, who joined Apple 
at age 15 when it was housed in Jobs' garage, new product development in some 
ways have become a victim of Apple's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we're in mainstream businesses and offices, people are having to use 
our technology because that is what the company has purchased. They're not 
necessarily choosing to use us like they did before. It means we can't get away 
with as much as we did before when just our devotees bought Macs," says the 
27-year-old Espinosa. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Espinosa says a fire has been lit under the advanced technology 
engineers. Sculley's "Knowledge Navigator" video, he claims, was designed more 
to inspire engineers within Apple than outside audiences. One result, he notes, 
is that the advanced technology group is organizing around integrated computer 
concepts, rather than around specialized technologies, such as video and audio 
that must be married at a later point. 
</P>
<P>
And he says the focus goes far beyond the Mac. "We're looking at how this 
technology can be used in totally new ways," he says. "This is the first time 
that we've done this across the large organization." 
</P>
<P>
The task may not be an easy, or quick, one. Explains Randy Battat, vice 
president of product marketing, "We're taking the Holy War to the next 
frontier." 
</P>
<P>

FUTURES MARKETS LAVISHLY COURT WASHINGTON TO PROTECT INTERESTS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two years ago at a Florida resort, one of the commodity futures markets now 
rocked by scandal in Chicago may have made a wise investment in its future. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Board of Trade treated Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Leahy's son, 
Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.) and English's wife to three days of sun and fun at 
a futures industry conference where the legislators' only work was 
participating in a panel discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The board paid all plane, food and lodging expenses as well as hefty 
honorariums -- $1,969 to Leahy and $1,000 to English -- for their stay at the 
"world class" Boca Raton Resort and Club, which features golf, tennis and 
oceanfront rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and English, chairman of a 
House Agriculture subcommittee, will now head investigations of the massive 
scandal in the Chicago futures markets and oversee any legislation to tighten 
regulation of commodity traders, who are suspected of defrauding investors of 
tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers are only two among legions who have been courted with campaign 
contributions and other largess by the Board of Trade and the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange, which also is at the center of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
And like their colleagues, Leahy and English deny that the gifts create a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think I could be bought with a trip to Florida?" Leahy asked 
indignantly in an interview. English dug out congressional hearing records to 
demonstrate that he has pushed for stronger policing of trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, the futures industry has built a warm relationship not only 
with Congress but with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a 14-year-old 
regulatory agency that is up for renewal by Congress this year. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's clout has apparently had its effect. The FBI undercover probe in 
Chicago centers on two gaps in federal regulations that have been known for 
more than a decade. One makes it easy for brokers to cheat customers; the other 
makes it almost impossible to catch those who cheat. 
</P>
<P>
But attempts within Congress and the trading commission to ban "dual trading" 
-- which allows brokers to trade for themselves and their customers at the same 
time -- and to require recording the exact time of each commodity transaction 
have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lobbying Defended 
</P>
<P>
"With no public lobby to question trading practices, a weak press and a 
Congress that sees this industry only as its fund-raisers, it's no surprise 
that blind deregulation has been the order of the day," said James M. Stone, a 
former commission chairman who now heads Plymouth Rock Assurance Co. of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Commodity exchanges in Chicago and elsewhere defend their heavy lobbying of 
Congress as necessary to explain an arcane system in which traders, frantically 
shouting orders to each other in open pits, set present and future prices on 
everything from pork bellies to Swiss francs. 
</P>
<P>
While the criminal investigation proceeds in Chicago, industry lobbyists are 
scrambling to head off a congressional crackdown on trading practices. They 
argue that improved self-regulation is the only way for American exchanges to 
ward off fierce competition from overseas marts. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges' lobbying is highly regarded. As Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. 
Yeutter once boasted when he was president of the Chicago Merc: "We probably do 
our job as well as anybody in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
To bolster their advocacy, the futures industry has showered members of 
Congress with campaign contributions, honorariums and expense-paid trips to 
vacation meccas. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last six years, political action committees, or PACs, representing 
traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange donated more 
than $1.7 million to Senate and House campaigns. Most of the congressional 
winners sit on panels that regulate trading practices or adjust tax laws of 
vital interest to traders' wallets. 
</P>
<P>
Top recipients from the two PACs were Rep. English, $27,000, and Senate 
Agriculture Committee member Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), $25,250. 
</P>
<P>
Other notable recipients, according to Federal Election Commission records, 
were House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. (Kika) de la Garza (D-Tex.), 
$24,500; Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), $23,500; 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), $11,000, and 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
A study by Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, found that individual 
commodity traders not only donated large sums to their PACs -- which then 
distributed the money to candidates -- but also gave extraordinary amounts on 
their own to congressional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tours, Speeches, Appearances 
</P>
<P>
Records show that while Yeutter headed the Merc, from 1978 to 1985, he 
contributed at least $13,400 to congressional candidates, $4,000 to 
presidential hopefuls, $1,750 to Republican party committees and $1,000 to 
PACs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, from 1982 through 1987, the two Chicago exchanges paid at least 
$90,800 in honorariums to members of the Senate and House Agriculture 
committees for speeches, seminar appearances and, in many cases, merely touring 
the exchanges' trading pits and back room operations. Figures for 1988 will not 
be available until May. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), the House Democratic whip as well as an 
influential member of the Agriculture Committee, hit the honorarium jackpot on 
a trip to Chicago in 1987. He picked up $1,000 apiece from the Board of Trade, 
the Mercantile Exchange and the Board of Options Exchange for conferring with 
officials and viewing the trading pits. 
</P>
<P>
On the same two-day jaunt he also received $2,000 apiece from Waste Management 
Inc. and Thompson &amp; Co., a lobbying firm -- and then flew to Los Angeles 
for a $1,000 speech to a group of Latino county officials. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Coelho said he had been alternately "supportive and hostile" 
toward the futures industry, depending on the concerns of farmers he 
represents. He added that he does not "desperately need honorariums to pay my 
mortgage because I give much of the money to charity." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying honorariums, the exchanges -- like many other interest 
groups -- entertain legislators and their families at prime vacation spots. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy, English and their family members were not the only ones put up at the 
Boca Raton resort for the futures industry conference in March, 1987. Also 
present with spouses were seven other members of the Senate and House 
Agriculture panels that regulate commodity markets. Picking up the tabs were 
the two Chicago exchanges, the New York Commodity Exchange and the Futures 
Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the Chicago Board of Trade staked Leahy and his wife to 
five days in London, where the senator made a speech to another futures 
industry conference. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy said recently that he took his daughter along, too, and paid her expenses 
as well as others that "cost me $5,200 out of pocket." He is not required to 
say in his Senate financial disclosure statement how much he was reimbursed by 
the Board of Trade for the London and Boca Raton trips. 
</P>
<P>
Before considering legislative action on the scandal, Leahy said, he wants to 
see if the FBI investigation turns up only "a few bad apples" or wider 
problems. He is being guided, he said, by his experience as a former 
prosecutor: "If they're breaking the law, throw their butts in jail, then 
tighten the law." 
</P>
<P>
The honorariums and expense-paid trips to fun places are particularly alluring 
to many members of Congress who claim they have difficulty living on 
$89,500-a-year salaries. Critics assert that the fees and trips cause greater 
ethical problems than campaign contributions because the money goes directly 
into lawmakers' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
But John M. Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Assn., denies that the 
torrent of favors influences legislation. "Congressmen are not for sale," he 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
He particularly defends honorariums as a means of getting badly distracted 
legislators to focus on the complexities of commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Arcane Concept' 
</P>
<P>
"Take a Southern California congressman," Damgard said. "His vote against the 
futures markets is a cheap one because we have no grass-roots support, though I 
could make a strong case that every housewife is a hell of a lot better off 
from the standpoint of paying taxes and buying coffee because of derivative 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's a fairly arcane concept, and most congressmen have 5,000 other 
things to worry about when I walk into their office. We think it is entirely 
appropriate to get them out to Chicago to view how those exchanges work." 
</P>
<P>
Damgard also defends what he calls lawmakers' "extended stays" at resorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Do we try to make it pleasant for them? Of course," he said. "Do we invite 
Sen. Leahy because he is the chairman of the committee that regulates us? You 
betcha; we would be stupid if we didn't. But it insults Sen. Leahy and us if 
that indicates a relationship where we buy influence." 
</P>
<P>
John C. White, a Merc lobbyist and former Democratic Party chairman, said that 
"the PAC and honorarium program gives you the opportunity to make your case. 
But I don't know that it would get a guy to vote with you or do something he 
felt was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. English, who has pledged a "thorough inquiry" into government and industry 
efforts to prevent illegal trading practices, said he will attend the futures 
industry conference in Boca Raton again next month but will not accept a fee. 
</P>
<P>
"I might give 'em a give-'em-hell speech," he said, "but no honorariums until 
the investigation is over and the reauthorization (of the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission) is done."

JAMES FLANIGAN: XEROX NOT JUST A PALE COPY OF ITS FORMER SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A New Yorker cartoon in the 1960s showed a dying man in a hospital bed saying 
in parting advice to his wife: "Don't sell Xerox." 
</P>
<P>
It was a good joke at the time. Xerox Corp. had introduced its copier in the 
1960s and earned a reputation as the very model of a fast-growing technology 
company -- and a stock that only went up. 
</P>
<P>
But the widow should have sold her Xerox, because the stock has gone down 
almost continually since hitting $172 a share in 1972. It fell as low as $42 in 
1982 and hasn't sold above $100 since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Xerox went from model to bad example. In the last two decades, 
the company blew a tremendous advantage, then struggled to regain 
competitiveness and now is fighting it out in world markets amid persistent 
doubts about its competence. 
</P>
<P>
And the time has come to resolve those doubts -- which is why Xerox is trading 
actively these days, at about $65 a share. There is talk that Xerox is getting 
its act together; it recently announced plans to get out of money-losing 
businesses and to trim its legendary bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
There is also skepticism -- "Xerox Rethinks -- Again" said a Business Week 
headline on its latest reorganization. And that has led to talk of takeover and 
breakup. The market is saying Xerox's new series of copiers and laser printers 
had better succeed in boosting earnings and the stock price, or a buyout will 
be launched. Wall Streeters, such as analyst Alex Henderson of 
Prudential-Bache, are estimating breakup values as high as $120 a share. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound incredible that proud Xerox should be subject to speculation about 
breakup. But like many U.S. companies, Xerox earned its tarnished reputation. 
</P>
<P>
It got comfortable. In the 1960s, the Xerox copying process was so ringed by 
patents that the company thought it need never fear competition. But within a 
decade, competitors had developed their own processes, and in the early '70s 
Japan's Ricoh, Canon and Minolta caught Xerox napping. 
</P>
<P>
The company at first chose not to compete with their smaller, cheaper copiers 
and retreated to its base in higher-priced, large copying machines. It took 
years before Xerox woke up and fought back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High-Minded Company 
</P>
<P>
Then there were years of wasted potential as Xerox became incredibly inventive 
-- but ignored its own inventions. Xerox' Palo Alto Research Center pioneered 
the principles behind Apple's Macintosh computer, Sun's engineering workstation 
and Microsoft's software. Yet Xerox used few of those inventions and used none 
of them well. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox flubbed businesses that should have been naturals -- such as the fax 
machine -- and went into businesses where competition was way ahead, like 
medical X-ray, which it is now dropping at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, while it was declining, Xerox's reputation was better than today. 
It was respected as a high-minded company, staffed with intelligent, thoughtful 
people. That thoughtful people could play office politics -- one part of Xerox 
stymieing product development in another -- wasn't recognized until recently. 
"Don't sell Xerox"? It's a wonder anyone would buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Except that Xerox -- again, like many U.S. companies -- is better than its 
current press notices, more competitive than it's been in years. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox has been taking market share from its international competitors for years 
-- thanks to tough-minded policies. Xerox has been forgoing price increases to 
regain customers, sacrificing short-term profit and letting the stock price 
slumber. It has spent heavily on product development, while Ricoh, Canon and 
Minolta have cut back programs. 
</P>
<P>
And now Xerox may be ready to deliver a clincher. Its new Series 50 copiers and 
laser printers are 20% cheaper to manufacture than past models. "They can 
deliver lower cost and lower maintenance to customers," says Brian Fernandez, 
research director of Brean Murray Foster Securities, who thinks that the new 
line will benefit profits dramatically in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Which might restore not only Xerox's stock price, but its standing as a model 
for U.S. industry: an object lesson that though you can't be comfortable in 
today's world markets, by playing for the long term, you can be both profitable 
and competitive.

<P>
When rock 'n' roll slammed into America in the '50s, the kids loved it, parents 
hated it and some wanted it banned. But now, closing in on 40, rock music 
permeates American society and has been exported and embraced throughout the 
world. Ironically, the record industry's Grammy Awards were slow to fall under 
the spell. That too has changed. The passages of rock are charted in three 
stories: 
</P>
<P>
* The notorious beginnings, seen through a movie about one of its wildest 
forefathers, Jerry Lee Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
* An analysis of the Grammys and rock's present respectability. 
</P>
<P>
* A look at the cutting-edge artists who are pushing into the future. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
To millions of rock fans, the words are the punch line to a joke -- with good 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Grammy choices were out of touch with the most vital currents of pop 
music -- often hilariously so. 
</P>
<P>
What respect can you have for an academy that gives best album or best record 
awards to Christopher Cross, the Captain &amp; Tennille, Toto, Olivia 
Newton-John and Glen Campbell, but none to Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, the 
Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, David Bowie, the Who, Bruce 
Springsteen, Marvin Gaye and Prince? 
</P>
<P>
Grammy critics have attacked the awards process with such acidity over the 
years that former rock musician Mike Greene sounds tame when he declares, 
"There were times when I winced when I heard the names of the winners being 
read." 
</P>
<P>
What makes Greene's remarks noteworthy is that he is the president of the 
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the sponsor of the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to Greene's efforts, however, the Grammys have undergone a 
remarkable transformation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Mention of the awards will still draw snickers from cutting-edge artists and 
fans (see article on The Extreme, Page 70), but the nominees and, crucially, 
the winners in the key Grammy categories are becoming increasingly creditable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of measuring achievement by sales and allegiance to traditional pop 
forms, academy members -- who determine the Grammy winners -- now recognize the 
extra dimension of rock-era pop: artful music that mirrors and shapes social 
and cultural attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Simon's "Graceland" and U2's "The Joshua Tree" were distinguished Grammy 
choices for album of the year in 1987 and 1988, respectively, and Tracy 
Chapman's widely praised debut album is the favorite to continue the winning 
streak on Wednesday when the 31st annual awards ceremony is held at the Shrine 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Progress is also reflected in the list of distinguished best-album nominees 
since 1984: Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A.," Prince's "Purple Rain" 
and "Sign 'O' the Times," Peter Gabriel's "So" and Sting's " . . . Nothing Like 
the Sun." Most would once have been rejected as too radical for mainstream 
Grammy sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Why the turnaround? 
</P>
<P>
Greene and his two immediate predecessors at the academy -- Bill Ivey and Mike 
Melvoin -- saw the weaknesses in the Grammy system and worked to correct them. 
The result: A modernization of the awards structure with the addition of blues, 
contemporary folk, rap, reggae and hard-rock/heavy-metal categories, among 
others, and the recruitment of more than 2,000 new members. 
</P>
<P>
Yet all three men acknowledge that the progress would have been impossible 
without one simple fact: attrition. Rock 'n' roll was dismissed during the 
early years of the Grammys as kid's music. Well, those kids have grown up. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Bill Ivey, who was chairman in 1981 and 1982, "The members now are 
comfortable with the vocabulary of rock 'n' roll . . . the use of political and 
socially sensitive lyrics, the use of a rock instrumental vocabulary and vocal 
performance style -- things that once seemed foreign to them." 
</P>
<P>
Off to a Bad Start 
</P>
<P>
Nel blu, dipinto di blu. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Title lyric from Domenico Modugno's 1958 hit 
</P>
<P>
Better known as "Volare (To Fly)," Modugno's 1958 recording was a hit in Italy 
before it was released in the the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Modugno and Franco Migliacci (who got the idea for the lyrics from a 
drawing on the back of a cigarette package), the song was a likable, curious 
tale about a man who paints his hands blue and dreams of flying through the 
air. Or something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Record executives saw so much potential in "Volare" that at least six other 
versions (including one by Dean Martin) were rushed out to compete with 
Modugno, but the Italian emerged victorious. His record spent six weeks at No. 
1 on the national pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
Like most pop hits, the song then faded into nostalgia -- revived at 
anniversaries or oldie radio shows. Its impact on pop music was nil. There 
wasn't a run of Italian hits, and Modugno faded from the scene after his 
follow-up -- "Piove" (Ciao, Ciao Bambina)" -- stalled at No. 97 on the charts. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason "Volare" is important at all is that it was named the best song 
and best record of the year at the first Grammy Awards ceremony in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
To many critics, it was the start of a losing steak that continued -- with rare 
exceptions -- for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Academy Goals 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences was formed almost by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce embarked in 1956 on a beautification project. 
The objective: Lining the streets with stars saluting the greats of radio, 
television, movies and recordings. To determine who should be honored, 
committees were set up in each of the fields. 
</P>
<P>
In its deliberations, the five-member recording industry committee decided to 
use sales as the basis for who would get the stars. But it became apparent that 
sales alone didn't measure an artistic achievement. What about saluting 
artistic excellence a la the motion picture Oscar? The answer was the start of 
the recording academy and the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
The academy had approximately 700 members -- all of whom were involved in the 
creative, rather than business end, of making records -- when the first awards 
were handed out on May 5, 1959 in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, sales -- from the beginning -- played a central role in the Grammy 
process. Almost without exception, the winners in the best record category have 
been Top 10 hits -- often No. 1 hits. The other characteristic of most best 
record winners: A smooth, easy-listening style. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of rock, there weren't many compelling choices in 1958. In fact, Grammy 
old-timers are probably grateful that they didn't make an even more 
embarrassing choice that first year. Among the five finalists: Ross 
Bagdasarian's novelty, "The Chipmunk Song." 
</P>
<P>
The Rock Gap 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see why rock was considered unworthy when the Grammy founders got 
together. The academy was the brainchild of the musical Establishment -- people 
raised on big bands and Tin Pan Alley who had shaped the post-World War II 
sounds now being evicted from the Top 10 by rock. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the voters seemed impervious to what was happening in the 
world at large. They tended to look at music in the narrowest and most 
technical terms. 
</P>
<P>
While rock chronicled the social revolution of the '60s in a way that has 
redesigned the nature and boundaries of pop, the Grammy voters in that 
turbulent decade were content to declare as record of the year such mellow 
offerings as Henry Mancini's "Moon River" and Frank Sinatra's "Strangers in the 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
Academy directors -- sensing a need to better recognize the rock community -- 
established a best contemporary/rock category in 1964. But the winners added 
little to Grammy credibility. The choices, from 1963 to 1966: Nino Tempo and 
April Stevens' "Deep Purple," Petula Clark's "Downtown," Roger Miller's "King 
of the Road" and -- in the year of the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" and the 
Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby" -- the New Vaudeville Band's novelty "Winchester 
Cathedral." 
</P>
<P>
By 1968, the embarrassment might have proved too much. The Grammys quietly 
dropped the contemporary/rock category. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of Change 
</P>
<P>
There were signs in the '70s that the Grammy membership -- nearly 4,000 by the 
end of the decade -- was becoming more responsive to rock-era sensibilities. 
Hard-core rock acts were still outsiders, but there was room for artists -- 
notably Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Billy Joel and Carole King -- who combined 
contemporary viewpoint and traditional pop craft. Wonder won three best album 
awards during the decade, while Simon won two. Joel and King received one each. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the membership's longstanding emphasis on sales and easy-listening 
traits continued to dominate the choices. 
</P>
<P>
By the early '80s, Greene was beginning to get involved in the academy. A 
musician-turned-businessman, Greene, now 39, served as president of the 
academy's Atlanta chapter and volunteer chairman of the national board of 
trustees before becoming its first paid president last year. 
</P>
<P>
The first academy chairman with a rock background, Greene felt badly that many 
of the artists who had inspired him had been overlooked by the academy. 
</P>
<P>
"You can go through the whole list of '60s rock artists -- Dylan, John Lennon, 
the Rolling Stones," Greene said recently, sitting in his office at the academy 
headquarters in Burbank. "They all affected me as a person and as a musician. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very much an activist in the South during the the civil rights movement. 
. . . Had my head banged around quite a few times in marches with Dr. King. I 
was also very much an involved in the whole Vietnamese (protests) . . . and 
rock music was there every step of the way, expressing how we all felt." 
</P>
<P>
In his early academy involvement, Greene didn't find any "us-vs.-them" attitude 
toward rock. He simply found lethargy, a condition, he felt, due largely to the 
fact that the organization relied solely on volunteer leadership. At the time 
he was volunteer chairman, for instance, Greene was also executive vice 
president of Crawford Post Production Inc., an Atlanta-based television post 
production firm. One of his early goals: The installation of a paid, full-time 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Greene found allies in his two predecessors as volunteer chairman: Bill Ivey, 
director of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville, and Mike Melvoin, a 
jazz-oriented keyboardist who played on the Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" and 
whose daughter, Wendy, was in Prince's Revolution band. 
</P>
<P>
Ivey urged the creation of new award categories to reflect ethnic and regional 
styles, while Melvoin concentrated on an "Operation Outreach" program to 
recruit new -- and younger -- members. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I'm sitting here now is that I saw we could make progress. I 
saw the academy as a big oil tanker and I saw it slowly starting to turn," 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw that the academy wanted to be a more open, inclusive type of 
organization, but that it just needed a kick in the ass to get them in the 
right direction. We are moving at the speed of light in relationship to what 
happened in the first couple of decades." 
</P>
<P>
About the increased credibility of the Grammys, he added, "I have a terribly 
warped belief in the theory that art -- be it literature or painting or film or 
music -- is really the only lasting watermark of a society and it's gratifying 
to me that the Grammy awards (better) reflect that extra (social) dimension 
that rock has brought to pop music." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he knows there will be upset victories that may again cause him to 
wince. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have an organization this big, you'll always have to take a deep 
breath. But, for me, last year was a litmus test of our progress. When I saw 
nominations for Peter Gabriel and U2 and a number of other artists who are 
doing such creative things and saying such important things in their music, (I 
was confident) we were headed in the right direction. The main goal was to make 
the Grammys respond to all areas of the creative community and I think we are 
within shouting distance of that goal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT IF . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
What would have been the best-record award winners if the Grammys had been more 
serious about rock 'n' roll? A list of Rolling Stone magazine's nominations for 
the year's best singles from 1964 to 1975 differs sharply from the best record 
Grammy Awards of those years -- the decade in which Grammy voters exhibited the 
least rock 'n' roll sensibilities. The Rolling Stone chart was taken from the 
magazine's ranking of the 100 best singles of the last 25 years.

QUILTS AND SCRIMSHAW IN WAY -OUT WEST?; 
</P>
<P>
'AMERICAN SAMPLER'- A FASCINATING SHOW AT COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What the heck is folk art anyway, and why do we keep aggravating ourselves 
with the question? We don't go around wringing our hands and moaning, "What is 
folk music?" It's that stuff with the fiddles and banjos. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever folk art is, there is a wunnerful new exhibition of it that just 
opened at the County Museum of Art. Titled "An American Sampler," it lays out 
120 signs, decoys, carousal critters and cigar-store Indians without 
surgeon-general warnings. Then there are quilts and scrimshaw. In case you've 
been napping in a hatbox on the top shelf in the closet, scrimshaw is carvings 
that look like ivory, but they aren't. Not usually. They are made out of whale 
bones and whale teeth -- you might say whale tusks. Still, they look a lot like 
ivory. 
</P>
<P>
One of these depicts a lady who is as naked as a baby bird. She looks a lot 
like one of those ancient Oriental ivories known as "doctors ladies." They say 
that in the old days, sick Oriental females used them to point out to the 
doctor where they hurt because they were so modest the doctor was not allowed 
to touch them or look at them in the buff. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, nobody says that exquisite Oriental ivory carvings are folk art, so why 
do we say these scrimshaw are folk art? As a matter of fact, the handsome 
carrousel animals -- the padding tiger and the vain giraffe -- bear suspicious 
resemblance to courtly ceramic animals in the Chinese gallery next door. So why 
is one grand art and the other folk art? Maybe because the carrousel animals 
have saddles for the kids to sit in. Since nobody ever saw a saddle on a tiger 
or a giraffe, these have an air of fable about them. Maybe that quality of 
magic brought to ordinary things is what makes folk art. Maybe it's a quality 
of domesticated mythology. This show makes us sigh for an America that may 
never have existed except in myth. 
</P>
<P>
What the ding-dang heck is folk art anyway? 
</P>
<P>
This exhibition makes it clear that whatever it is, it is more than one thing. 
Out here in California we tend to think of folk art as being made by loners, 
eccentric outsiders with no art training, such as Simon Rodia or Grandma 
Prisbrey, who just up and make private worlds for themselves. We think of them 
as neighborhood oddballs and hermits or social outcasts like the black folk 
artists in a memorable exhibition seen at the Craft and Folk Museum or in "Cat 
and a Ball on a Waterfall" at the Oakland Museum. That's the kind of folk art 
we tend to have here in the far-out West. 
</P>
<P>
But "An American Sampler" -- on view through April 30 -- insists there is more 
than one kind of American folk art. It comes from the Shelburne Museum, which 
is situated on the shore of Lake Champlain in southern Vermont. Considered the 
leading repository of the genre, it was founded in 1947 by Electra Havemeyer 
Webb, youngest daughter of the Henry O. Havemeyers, the great collectors who 
bequeathed a famous gift of Impressionist and Old Master paintings to 
Manhattan's Metropolitan Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Given that provenance, it is not surprising that Mrs. Webb's exasperated mother 
once asked, "How can you, Electra, you who have been brought up with Rembrandts 
and Manets, live with such American trash?" It is also not surprising that the 
East Coast Shelburne collection presents us a more civilized version of folk 
art. 
</P>
<P>
Where the California version tends to emphasize the idiosyncratic, the Eastern 
version plays to something almost classical. A Brunnhilde figurehead, circa 
1850, was clearly made by an artist who knew about Baroque sculpture. It would 
not look out of place in a mainstream gallery. On the other hand, a stark 
little carving of a revolutionary soldier looks real direct and frank, like one 
of those African tribal sculpture. Maybe folk art is everything in between 
academic art and primitive art that doesn't quite fit either category. 
</P>
<P>
What the willy-dad-blasted heck is folk art anyway? 
</P>
<P>
One thing is sure, it isn't a handle that was invented by anybody that makes 
the stuff. Nobody says, "Here in our little town we play folk music and make 
folk carvings." If they do, you smell a rat, since folk art's charm is supposed 
to include unself-consciousness. The category certainly came into being as part 
of the avant-garde modernist movement that was so generous about recognizing 
non-academic art and so enthusiastic about copying its virtues. A sculptor such 
as Elie Nadelman based his whole oeuvre on folk figures. To this day,many a 
modern artist shares qualities often ascribed to folk artists. Warhol was a 
naif, O'Keeffe a no-bull earth mother and the whole lot stood outside the 
social mainstream doing it their way until they became the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Here folk art comes across as a popular art ancestor of Pop art. The show is 
punctuated with oversize common objects, such as a huge rocking chair that 
makes us feel 3 years old again. There are trade signs like a huge tooth, giant 
rifle and oversize spectacles that have the same hyperbolic Yankee humor that 
turns ironical and multilayered in Claes Oldenburg. Big rock candy mountain. 
It's very patriotic stuff full of bald eagles and George Washingtons that set 
you thinking about the deadpan flags of Jasper Johns and the inability of 
sophisticated city people to honestly express a corny emotion. 
</P>
<P>
A breath of fresh air blows through the mind when you look at quilts made with 
more concern for love than for time, quilts dedicated to friendship proved 
through endless hours of affectionate labor. 
</P>
<P>
The downside of folk art is that it remains imprisoned in convention like some 
decent modest soul who always sticks to the neighborhood rules. Its concern 
with good behavior rarely allows any emotional outburst, but here there is a 
quilt that defies the rules, looking like a haunted Rorschach blot. The upside 
of folk art is an innocent approach to the business of making art that lends it 
an authentic aura of wonder and surprise. Look at that wooden Indian weather 
vane. It is conceived like a flat, drawn profile silhouette, but it has real 
thickness that gives it a funny frontal view where the gesturing arm seems to 
come out of the middle of the chest. Alberto Giacometti would have loved it. He 
would have loved the cigar-store Indian on the wheeled wagon. 
</P>
<P>
All art is, in fact, concerned with verisimilitude, getting it to look like the 
thing depicted. What every artist learns is that you can't do that because 
sheet tin has no third dimension and wood is not flesh. You have to settle for 
some aspect of reality and that way you wind up exaggerating part of it. Great 
folk art uses guess work and respect for the material to come to the same 
decisions as great art in general. When it doesn't, it remains a craft object. 
</P>
<P>
A life-size Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines captures the same drama of solid 
volumes as an Egyptian old kingdom figure. Our jaunty soldier takes on a wry 
sense of self-importance. An adamantly accurate weather vane depicting a 
horse-drawn fire engine retains life-size detail at about one-tenth scale. It 
has a vivid hallucinatory presence of surreality like a Rene Magritte. 
</P>
<P>
So folk art is just art made by folks who get the better of themselves. At 
best, it has all the clout of mainstream art with the added endearments of 
modesty, independence and willingness to face the unknown. Just doing the best 
with what it's got, it sometimes creates aesthetic effects accidentally. The 
French call it bricolage.

SHAKING UP THE TOURISTS WITH A JOLT OF 'REALITY';

<P>
UNIVERSAL'S $13-MILLION RIDE WILL FEATURE AN 'EARTHQUAKE' THAT SOME SAY IS TOO 
CONVINCING

<P>
Imagine you're pulling into one of Metro Rail's new Downtown destinations deep 
under the busy city streets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel opens into the brightly lit chamber of the subway station just 
ahead. You anticipate leaving the train and rejoining the life above ground, 
where the sun shines and high-rises glitter in the summer haze. 
</P>
<P>
But as you draw level with the station platform, the train shudders slightly. 
You feel the car's metal skin shiver as if with a warning chill. The woman in 
the next seat looks suddenly unhappy. Other passengers voice a rising murmur of 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing to be worried about, folks," says the smooth voice of the train driver 
over the loudspeaker. "Just one of the hundred or so little shakes we have in 
the city each year." 
</P>
<P>
A deep and distant rumble strikes your ear. Before you can react, a hot wind 
blasts through the subway. 
</P>
<P>
The train begins a violent rocking -- up and down, side to side, tilting and 
yawing. The track bed sinks, dropping the trapped passengers' faces level with 
the edge of the platform. Everywhere there is the screech of buckling metal, 
the crunch of collapsing concrete. Sparks fly from severed electric coils, 
arcing small lightning flashes across the station. The smell of escaping gas is 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The roaring is terrible. The Earth itself seems to be shrieking in agony. 
Suddenly a great chunk of the concrete station roof crashes down on the 
platform, along with a sparking power line. A huge tanker truck carrying 
propane gas slides down the tilt and comes close to crushing your subway car. 
</P>
<P>
Another train rushes into the station from the opposite direction and slams 
into the propane truck at high speed. The truck jackknifes and explodes, 
sending a whoosh of flames and heat into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Another deep roaring sound bursts through the cacophony. A flood of water 
rushes down the station's steps and rolls at you with the force of a small 
tidal wave. 
</P>
<P>
At the last instant the train jerks forward. The passengers barely escape. 
</P>
<P>
You and the other scared riders rush from the scene of chaos into the safety of 
the Universal Studios back lot. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake -- The Big One is the name the Universal Studios Tour has given to 
its newest fright experience. Earthquake will deliver, up to 200 times a day, a 
145-second simulation of an 8.3 Richter-scale shake. 
</P>
<P>
The ride will open March 18. The opening had been set for Nov. 21, 1988, but 
was delayed for technical and business reasons, said Joan Bullard, public 
relations vice president of MCA, parent company of Universal Studios. Hitches 
occurred in the ride's erupting floor and the Tessler coils that create showers 
of sparks. After the delay caused by these problems, it was decided to wait 
until the Easter school break to open Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, someone thinks there is money to be made in imaginary disaster: 
Universal's planning and development team has poured extraordinary ingenuity -- 
plus $13 million -- into fabricating the simulation. 
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone is amused by the big-budget amusement. Some people who 
have suffered in a real earthquake are put off by the idea of simulating one 
for fun, and a UCLA professor of psychiatry, Dr. Lewis Jolyon West, warns that 
such a ride might be psychologically damaging to children. 
</P>
<P>
West says children under 10 can be traumatized by such an experience, real or 
simulated, and that he is still treating youngsters for nightmares and phobias 
that started after the October, 1987, tremor that caused major damage in 
Whittier and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Thrill-seeking behavior in the service of amusement is one thing when a 
fantasy like King Kong is the tame terror object," West said in referring to a 
Universal show that features a huge mechanical ape. "But earthquake simulation 
comes very close to people's real fears. I wonder if it's wise to use an event 
as likely and threatening as the Big One to make a kid's hair stand on end." 
</P>
<P>
However, West says, for some children such a ride might actually lessen fear of 
an earthquake. "Inoculating yourself with a controlled amount of fright is 
called 'counterphobic behavior.' It can condition you in advance for the 
traumas of the real experience. But you never know how each individual would 
react, and I don't advise any parent to risk a child in the Earthquake ride." 
</P>
<P>
The equipment needed to put people into the proper state of fear is under the 
command of technical affairs director Larry Lester. The Earthquake concrete 
shell houses an array of air compressors, hydraulic lifts, electric coils and 
high-pressure water-pumping stations to create a vivid array of shaking, 
sinking, sagging, sparking and flooding scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
"We outlined seven basic terrors we wanted to scare up in the tourists," Lester 
said. "These are: fears of an unstable earth, of electrocution, being buried 
alive, fire, darkness, abandonment and drowning. We want people to run the 
gamut from uncertainty about what's happening to them to disbelief, to absolute 
fright. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, they know it's just a show and that they'll come out OK. But all 
the same, we want to make their hair stand on end." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for Earthquake came from Jay Stein, president of MCA Recreation 
Services, which owns and operates the Universal tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay had the idea in the late 1970s," explained Barry Upson, MCA's executive 
vice president for planning and development. "But the technological expertise 
to make it happen in all its dramatic detail has only recently been perfected." 
</P>
<P>
Planning for Earthquake began with a story board -- a kind of comic strip that 
sketches out the sequence in a series of frames. After months of discussion, 
the story line was agreed on and several scale models of a collapsing subway 
station were built in a Universal back-lot studio. After testing and 
modification, the models were turned into reality by Lester's team, aided by a 
roster of specialized consultants ranging from structural engineers and 
architects to hydraulic and electrical effects specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Lester, a one-time pipe welder, helicopter pilot and set designer, has helped 
devise several of Universal Studios' popular shows, including "King Kong," 
"Miami Vice" and "Star Wars." He has become a specialist in designing the kind 
of reality-simulating experiences that have become a staple of theme and 
entertainment parks around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire sequence is computerized to function without human intervention," 
Lester explained. "As soon as the train is in the station, the effects are 
triggered automatically. Fifteen seconds after one train leaves the station at 
the end of a sequence, the set is ready for the next. 
</P>
<P>
"The water's pumped out instantly, the cracked beams are righted, the propane 
truck and the collapsed ceiling slab are lifted back into place. The only 
evidence left of the previous scene is the wet floor of the station platform, 
and that just seems a natural part of a routine cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
Lester explained that a subway station was chosen for Earthquake because it 
offered an enclosed and controlled environment. "A quake that took place on a 
freeway or a city street would be more difficult to make real," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the extravaganzas offered to Universal's 4-million-plus annual 
visitors, Earthquake is a "reality show." It is not science-fiction fantasia or 
cowboy stunts or cop capers, not the "Parting of the Red Sea" or "Conan's 
Sword" and "Sorcery Spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake's physical safety precautions are rigorous. Its effects have been 
tested for potential impacts on every possible condition large and small, from 
the stresses in the concrete construction to the current in a tourist's 
heart-pacemaker coils. 
</P>
<P>
If a terrified tour rider tries to jump out of the car, infrared light curtains 
and sensitive pressure sensors built into the platform edge will immediately 
override the computers and freeze the action. In addition, the tour guide 
carries a panic button that can also stop the show in mid-scene. 
</P>
<P>
And what if a real earthquake should occur during a ride? Chances are that no 
one would be hurt. The Earthquake attraction is designed to survive a real 8.3 
temblor without major damage. 
</P>
<P>
"The show would probably be one of the safest places to be in a real event," 
Lester said, smiling. "After all, everything is on platforms designed to rock 
with the shock. And, since our show lasts 145 seconds and an actual quake 
seldom goes more than half that time, tour visitors would be unaware that 
anything had happened outside the set."

RIDE'S FUN BUT NOT FACT, METRO RAIL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Metro Rail experts strongly deny that Universal Studios' Earthquake ride 
accurately represents what would really in the Los Angeles subway during a 
major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
"This Earthquake thing sounds like a lot of fun, but it's actually total 
fiction," said James Crawley, director of rail facilities engineering at the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District, which is in charge of Metro Rail, 
now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
"In a quake a subway station would be one of the safest places to be. Our 
tunnels and stations are designed to take a tremendous amount of lateral and 
vertical shaking without collapse." 
</P>
<P>
Crawley cites the 1985 Mexico City quake, which registered 8.1 on the Richter 
scale; the subways sustained only a brief power outage. 
</P>
<P>
"In choosing a subway station for their quake show, Universal made a serious 
reality error," said Buzz Spellman, Metro Rail project geologist. 
</P>
<P>
A vice president of Converse Consultants, which prepares geotechnical and 
seismological reports on the L.A. subway for the RTD, Spellman also emphasized 
subways' quake resistance. "In fact," he said, "there is no record anywhere in 
the world of major subway damage in a quake -- and that includes the 
experiences of Tokyo as well as Mexico City." 
</P>
<P>
None of the tunnels of San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system has been 
damaged during a tremor, engineers say. 
</P>
<P>
Another example, closer to home, is the Metropolitan Water District's 
underground San Fernando Valley water tunnel during the 6.4 Sylmar temblor in 
1971. The 20-foot-diameter circular concrete tube that ran through the quake 
zone was undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Metro Rail designers said that like the Universal Studios Earthquake ride, 
Metro Rail has fail-safe systems. "Our track beds and station platforms will be 
equipped with a sophisticated earthquake detection system," said Harold Storey, 
RTD safety director. 
</P>
<P>
"Immediately as a tremor begins, seismic sensors buried along the line will 
automatically shut down trains." Leon Whiteson

<P>
When rock 'n' roll slammed into America in the '50s, the kids loved it, parents 
hated it and some wanted it banned. But now, closing in on 40, rock music 
permeates American society and has been exported and embraced throughout the 
world. Ironically, the record industry's Grammy Awards were slow to fall under 
the spell. That too has changed. The passages of rock are charted in three 
stories: 
</P>
<P>
The notorious beginnings, seen through a movie about one of its wildest 
forefathers, Jerry Lee Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the Grammys and rock's present respectability. 
</P>
<P>
A look at the cutting-edge artists who are pushing into the future. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago the Grammys shunned Little Richard and Jerry Lee. Ten years 
later they ignored the Stones, Hendrix and the Who. A decade ago, the Sex 
Pistols and the Clash went unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
And in the '80s there's been no place in the Grammys for Public Enemy, the 
Sugarcubes, the Pogues and Elvis Costello. 
</P>
<P>
This might not seem like the crime of the century, especially at a time when 
the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences is changing its image from 
booster of the bland to champion of serious artists making serious social 
observations -- as long as they sell a million records or so. 
</P>
<P>
Well, better U2 than Christopher Cross. But does anyone think that if U2 had 
remained just a little cult band, "The Joshua Tree" would have been album of 
the year? The simple, hard fact is that if it's not a hit, most of the voters 
don't hear it. 
</P>
<P>
But even if they were force-fed a diet of Suicidal Tendencies and Guns N' 
Roses, academy members would be unlikely to change their tune; it's not the 
nature of academies to welcome those dedicated to subverting institutions like 
academies. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of reinstituting the rock 'n' roll and punk embargoes, the Grammys now 
acknowledge big-selling anti-heroes like Guns N' Roses, Metallica and Public 
Enemy by creating ghettos -- separate categories for hard rock, rap et al. 
Welcome to the back of the bus, from all the black and country artists who've 
been kept off center stage. 
</P>
<P>
In assembling this voters' guide to the most worthy extremists of the day, the 
idea wasn't to scour the underground and enshrine the most obscure sludge. 
These 12 acts all claim significant fan and critical support, and are currently 
in fine creative form. These are the artists who are shaping things, taking 
chances, testing limits, expressing a vision, defining attitudes, opening 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be at the top of the charts, but this music -- on its own or 
filtered through its disciples -- will figure strongly in the process of 
renewal that keeps rock 'n' roll forever young. 
</P>
<P>
Just imagine a Grammy show that acknowledged this. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Now, to present the award for Best Inspirational Drone Band, please welcome 
one of the major influences on glam and punk, that minimalist man about 
Manhattan, Mr. Lou Reed. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, Sheena. You know, I didn't think we'd ever see a band that uses 
fewer chords and more feedback than we did in the Velvet Underground (thank 
you, thank you). Or a singer who makes me sound like Terence Trent D'Arby. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, maybe on paper it doesn't look so great. But if you've heard 'Psychocandy' 
or 'April Skies' or that killer take on Bo Diddley's 'Who Do You Love,' you 
know you've experienced the majestic melancholy that only pure rock 'n' roll 
can attain. I know what it is to be mistaken for a joke, guys, so carry this 
award proudly -- and stick it in their teeth if you have to. Ladies and 
gentlemen, from Scotland, THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And so it would go. Here are the other 11. 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC ENEMY (Presenter: Gil Scott-Heron). Delivering their rhymes like Molotov 
cocktails, the New York rappers bring the '60s' black militant stance into the 
'80s: It's them against a repressive system full of corruption and conspiracy. 
Punching out their tough, assured rhythms, Chuck D and crew pump themselves up 
to archetypal proportions -- the Public Enemy, a rude intrusion on a kinder, 
gentler nation. The group spends much of its second album, last year's "It 
Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back," refusing to apologize for its 
first album -- where it touted controversial black-power advocate Louis 
Farrakhan, and "sampled" other people's music. Chuck D extends his challenge to 
black radio. His declaration of war: You singers are spineless /As you sing 
your senseless songs to the mindless / Your general subject of love is minimal 
/ It's sex for profit. 
</P>
<P>
GUNS N' ROSES (Presenters: Keith Richards and Steve Tyler). Forget the bad-boy 
antics. Forget the swagger and the leather. Forget the fact that it all sounds 
a little familiar. The Hollywood heroes have emerged from the glitter pack and 
become the rebel rockers of choice for the hard-rock fans who demand a true "us 
against them" mentality rather then empty posturing. GN'R casts a bloodshot, 
documentary eye on the wonderful life in their wonderful town. "Welcome to the 
jungle," W. Axl Rose sings to open their hit album "Appetite for Destruction." 
Strains of lost innocence sweeten the pot, and the stormy, Stones/Aerosmith/New 
York Dolls guitar attack is tough enough to blow the cobwebs off the central 
cliche -- Hollywood as a seductress and corrupter. It's also erratic and 
threatening enough to put Guns N' Roses at the very edge of acceptability. (For 
many former fans, Rose's rants against immigrants and gays on the current hit 
mini-album, "G N'R Lies" have pushed the band over the edge.) Like the punk 
innovators of the '70s, Guns N' Roses marks the last stop for those who want to 
get off before things get too scary. 
</P>
<P>
THE REPLACEMENTS (Presenter: Ian Hunter). The all-American misunderstood boys 
(non-metal division) play guitar rock that unfailingly gathers itself into a 
sweet melody line straight from the heart, no matter how chaotic and ramshackle 
the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Chaotic and ramshackle are the operative words on the concert stage, where the 
Minneapolis' foursome's unpredictability has made them the stuff of legend. 
Torn between the perverse impulse to throw it all away and the rock 'n' roll 
imperative to make it (one foot in the door / The other one in the gutter, they 
sang on 1987's "Pleased to Meet Me"), Paul Westerberg and company come off as 
rambunctious, melancholy, irreverent, wistful, romantic, bleary 
existentialists. Westerberg is a true natural, a Huck Finn/Jimmy Stewart 
innocent taking on the world with a Mott the Hoople defiance. He has some of 
the primal rock instincts and intensity of a John Fogerty -- but with a 
different set of musical roots ('70s hit pop, glam-rock), and a finely 
developed sense of irony. 
</P>
<P>
THE POGUES (Presenter: Van Morrison). The Clancy Brothers on speed, the 
Chieftains in heat. The brawling Irish/English brigade was the first to exploit 
the similarities between traditional Irish folk music and punk-rock: the cries 
of alienation, the frantic slam-dance tempos. Singer Shane MacGowan is an 
unpredictable, eccentric singer, wobbly but concentrating, coarse but vivid -- 
a bit like his buddy Joe Strummer. While they're cleaning up the act musically 
-- and dabbling amusingly in Middle Eastern and Mexican forms -- they're coming 
up with better songs. The last Pogues album, 1987's "If I Should Fall from 
</P>
<P>
Grace With God," moves from Irish death obsessions to ghost stories to 
race-track limericks to love laments to political protest. And now the advance 
single from the next album comes along sounding like a giddy lost Motown 
rocker. 
</P>
<P>
JANE'S ADDICTION (Presenter: Iggy Pop). Sweet, elusive psychedelic reveries 
alternate with hard-rock revelry on "Nothing's Shocking," last year's major- 
label debut by the latest great hope from the battlefields of the L.A. rock 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Confessional then distant, insistent then oddly distracted, the band can get 
pretty slippery, but Perry Farrell keeps you from giving up. The raspy-voiced 
urchin is a compelling presence at the center of the storm, confronting his 
demons in rock 'n' roll psychodramas like "Had a Dad," then sketching an 
aching, sympathetic slice of Hollywood life in "Jane Says." The band's 
rambunctious reputation rests more on its arrogant image and anything-goes live 
shows than on this friendly and accessible record. 
</P>
<P>
THE SUGARCUBES (Presenters: Nina Hagen and Grace Slick). It's not as though 
Iceland is another planet -- they do have radio and television there. Still, 
there's a faintly alien tone in this Icelandic band's dense but airy tone 
poems. It sounds like something that developed in isolation, cut off from 
rock's major currents, and singer Bjork's possessed vocals contribute to the 
Nordic mystery of the enigmatic songs. All of which might explain why last 
year's debut album, "Life's Too Good," became the rage of the alternative 
market. 
</P>
<P>
ICE-T (Presenter: Curtis Mayfield). The L.A. rapper's second album, "Power," 
opens with the sounds of an argument and a shooting over an advance tape of the 
album. That sums up a good part of Mr. T's turf: self-promotion and urban 
violence. Even if you don't buy the whole pose and package, it's hard to resist 
the momentum and intense action of his L.A. gang scenarios. One narrative on 
"Power" scraps the common 4/4 rap rhythms and floats over a cool, jazzy 
background -- a Tom Waits/ Raymond Chandler exercise that suggests new options 
for creative rappers. (The other part of his turf is sex, depicted in terms 
that might make Prince blush and infected with a deep misogyny. Needs work 
here.) 
</P>
<P>
METALLICA (Presenter: Ozzy Osbourne). How do the kingpins of the "new metal" 
differ from the heroes of mainstream heavy metal? Their spare, scowling guitar 
rock has none of the craven melodies and grandiose cymbal-crashing of ambitious 
chart-climbers. They race along like a punk band, they shift rhythms like a 
fusion group. They don't sing about girls, preferring to consider systems of 
oppression and symptoms of depression. They don't dress in spangles and romp 
around like circus acrobats. They don't grin and pretend to be your buddies, 
they don't wear makeup and pretend to be the devil. Their guitar solos -- which 
occupy much of their records and shows -- are direct, with no electronic 
gimmickry. What Metallica does have in common with the old guys is a standing 
reservation in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
BH SURFERS (Presenter: Roky Erikson, legendary Texas visionary and leader of 
'60s psychedelic band the Thirteenth Floor Elevators). If Guns N' Roses are one 
of those "lock up your daughters" bands, the Surfers' cry might be "lock up 
your dogs." No quirks of human behavior are beyond the grasp of these Austin 
eccentrics, whose edge-of-chaos sound drills down to subconscious pools of 
depravity and scatology. They generate a hallucinatory state in which ordeals 
can be hilarious and cleansing as well as disturbing. The band's live show, 
with its grim films, obsessed dual drummers, burning bass, brain-tapping strobe 
lights, bullhorn vocals and topless dancers, is unequalled for creating an air 
of imminent collapse. 
</P>
<P>
SUICIDAL TENDENCIES (Presenter: Pete Townshend). Few bands have articulated 
youthful alienation better than this Venice group, which has bridged the punk 
and metal worlds over the course of its three albums. The cult hit 
"Institutionalized" was just the beginning. The group's recent LP, "How Will I 
Laugh Tomorrow . . . When I Can't Even Smile Today," is an interior journey 
from pain, madness, hopelessness, impotence and isolation to determination and 
action. It rides on a brisk, crushing barrage that's not really out of the 
metal mainstream -- but ST's overall tone is a little rougher than the norm, 
and the gang trappings contribute to their threatening air. 
</P>
<P>
ELVIS COSTELLO (Presenter: Bob Dylan). A lifetime achievement award for the 
elder statesman of this maverick delegation. From the new-wave upstart of "My 
Aim Is True" to the revitalized upstart of the new "Spike," Costello has cut a 
monumental path through '80s pop music. Dissecting both love and politics with 
intricate imagery, moving restlessly from hard-rock to country to soul to torch 
song to folk, the bespectacled one has delivered the goods with true rage.

GAZING INTO A CRYSTAL BALL;

<P>
BETS ARE ON NEWCOMER TRACY CHAPMAN FOR A SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tracy Chapman is about to become a household name. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year old singer from Boston is expected to sweep the 31st annual Grammy 
Awards on Wednesday night, winning in all six categories in which she was 
nominated. That would represent the best showing ever by a new artist, 
surpassing Christopher Cross' five-award blitz in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's critically hailed debut album "Tracy Chapman" is the betting favorite 
to win the Grammy for album of the year and her "Fast Car" -- a stark portrait 
of a woman trapped in a cycle of poverty -- has the inside track to be named 
both best record and song. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman is also expected to win in three other categories: new artist, female 
pop vocal and contemporary folk performance. Only two other performers have 
ever won as many as six Grammys in one year: Roger Miller with six in 1966 for 
"King of the Road," and Michael Jackson with eight in 1984 for the "Thriller" 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is back in the record of the year finals with "Man in the Mirror," and 
could upset the Chapman bandwagon. There will be some sentiment to give the 
award to Jackson to take the sting out of his Grammy shutout last year. 
</P>
<P>
Perennial Grammy favorite Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" will also 
receive support in the best record balloting. The hit was so pervasive, it 
found its way into the presidential race when George Bush briefly adopted it as 
his campaign theme song. Also up for best record: Anita Baker's "Giving You the 
Best That I Got" and Steve Winwood's "Roll With It." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's strongest challengers in the best album race are George Michael's 
"Faith" and Sting's " . . . Nothing Like the Sun." Michael, the former leader 
of the bubble gum duo Wham!, has come a long way in the past two years. But he 
is still regarded by some as contrived and blatantly commercial. Sting is a 
Grammy perennial, with nine awards since 1980. But ". . . Nothing Like the Sun" 
didn't have the impact that "Tracy Chapman" did. 
</P>
<P>
Also vying for best album: Winwood's "Roll With It" and McFerrin's "Simple 
Pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't Worry, Be Happy" is Chapman's main rival in the best song finals, but it 
lacks the social consciousness of "Fast Car" and other recent champs like "We 
Are the World" and "That's What Friends Are For." Also nominated: Baker's 
"Giving You the Best That I Got," Sting's "Be Still My Beating Heart" and 
Brenda Russell's "Piano in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
There's no contest in the best new artist race. The also-rans are Vanessa 
Williams, Toni Childs, Rick Astley and Take 6. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney Houston could give Chapman a run for the pop female vocal award. 
Houston, nominated for "One Moment in Time," won in this category in 1986 and 
1987, but she'll probably finish second this time. Also nominated: Joni 
Mitchell, Taylor Dayne and Brenda Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman is a shoo-in in the contemporary folk category. The competition: Sweet 
Honey in the Rock, John Prine, Michelle Shocked and the South African artists 
on the "Homeland" compilation. 
</P>
<P>
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's lighthearted, universal lament, 
"Parents Just Don't Understand," is expected to win in the new rap category, 
while Metallica's critically admired " . . . And Justice for All" is the one to 
beat in the new hard rock/metal division. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the likely winners in other key categories: 
</P>
<P>
Pop Vocal Performance, Male: McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy," by the 
narrowest of margins over Michael's "Father Figure." Also nominated in this 
ultra-competitive race: Sting, Steve Winwood and three-time champ Phil Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Pop Duo/Group: Look for the Beach Boys to win their first Grammy with the No. 1 
hit "Kokomo." Also possible: Brenda Russell &amp; Joe Esposito's "Piano in the 
Dark." 
</P>
<P>
Rock Female: Tina Turner's "Tina Live in Europe" over Pat Benatar's "All Fired 
Up" and releases by three critically acclaimed newcomers: Sinead O'Connor, Toni 
Childs and Melissa Etheridge, who will likely split the "progressive" vote. 
</P>
<P>
Rock Male: Look for Rod Stewart to win his first Grammy for "Forever Young" in 
a close race with Eric Clapton's "After Midnight" from his "Crossroads" 
compilation (which is a cinch to win for best historical album). Also possible: 
Robert Palmer's "Simply Irresistible." 
</P>
<P>
Rock Duo/Group: U2 triumphed last year with "The Joshua Tree" and is likely to 
win again with the hit single "Desire." Also possible: INXS' "Kick." 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B Female and R&amp;B Song: Baker won in these categories two years ago 
with "Rapture" and "Sweet Love," respectively, and should repeat this year with 
"Giving You the Best That I Got." 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B Male: Look for Luther Vandross to win his first Grammy with his album 
"Any Love." Also possible: Teddy Pendergrass and Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
R&amp;B Duo/Group: Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips seem to be headed for their 
first Grammy in 15 years with their hit "Love Overboard." Also possible: New 
Edition and the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Country Female: Last year's winner, K.T. Oslin, and the 1987 champ, Reba 
McEntire, are vying again. Look for Oslin to repeat with "Hold Me." 
</P>
<P>
Country Male: Last year's winner, Randy Travis, is apt to retain his title with 
"Old 8 X 10." 
</P>
<P>
Country Duo/Group: The Judds -- for the fourth time in the past five years -- 
with "Give a Little Love." 
</P>
<P>
Country Vocal Collaboration: Roy Orbison &amp; k.d. Lang's "Crying," one of 
Orbison's last recordings before his death in December, should squeak past 
Dwight Yoakam &amp; Buck Owens' "Streets of Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
Grein correctly predicted all five of the album of the year nominees and four 
of the five record of the year finalists earlier this year.

WHY LOS ANGELES IS COURTING THE GRAMMYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials -- stung last year by the Grammy Awards ceremony 
being held in New York City after six years at L.A.'s Shrine Auditorium -- are 
going all out to keep the awards here permanently. 
</P>
<P>
James Stewart, executive director of the Los Angeles Host Committee for the 
1989 Grammy Awards, said the city has raised approximately $200,000 through 
private donations to sponsor a series of activities saluting the return of the 
Grammys to the Shrine on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts have included placing of "Los Angeles Welcomes the Grammy Awards" 
banners around town, a half-day "Grammys in the Schools" program held last 
Friday, a three-concert jazz "Night on the Town," also last Friday, and a 
reception to be hosted by Mayor Tom Bradley on Monday night for Grammy 
officials at the new Gene Autry Heritage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Six hundred officers and members of the Grammy-sponsoring National Academy of 
Recording Arts and Sciences are expected to attend the mayor's reception. 
</P>
<P>
"(Keeping the Grammys in L.A.) is the No. 1 result we're after," said Stewart 
(no relation to the actor). The awards show has been held in Los Angeles all 
but five years since the Grammys were initiated in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences, sponsors of the Grammys, said no decision has been made about the 
site of next year's event, but did acknowledge that New York members of the 
academy are "hopeful of getting it back." 
</P>
<P>
Though the city benefits from the business generated by the estimated 3,000 
people who will come to town for the Grammy ceremonies, Host Committee chairman 
Sheldon I. Ausman said his committee is motivated by more than the money the 
awards generate. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view of this is on a much higher plane," said Ausman, who is chairman of 
the board of KCET. Noting that the committee is part of a broader Mayor's Blue 
Ribbon Committee for the Entertainment Industry, he added, "The Grammys and the 
Academy Awards and the Emmys represent Los Angeles as the home of the 
entertainment industry, and we would like to keep all three shows here."

FULLERTON HAS TO WORK OVERTIME TO DEFEAT SAN JOSE THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JOSE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the sort of roar usually reserved in the Big West Conference for days 
when Nevada Las Vegas is on the ropes, but this time it came at the expense of 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
When Tom Desiano hit a 12-foot jumper with 55 seconds left in San Jose State's 
game against the Titans Saturday, it set the fans thumping in Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Desiano's shot gave the Spartans a one-point lead, their first of the game, and 
it put victory into the minds of most of the crowd of 1,874. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State, the team made up mostly of football players, a team manager and 
assorted other walk-ons since 10 players began boycotting in protest of Coach 
Bill Berry last month, had lost its past 12 games, seven since the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
This was the closest yet, but Fullerton pulled out a 70-69 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Johnson, who as a Spartan tailback led the Big West Conference in 
rushing, hit the first of two free throws with 8 seconds left in regulation to 
tie the score. But he missed the second, and the game went to overtime after 
Fullerton was unable to score in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose (5-19 overall, 1-14 in the conference) had a 69-67 lead as the 
overtime period ran down, but Fullerton's John Sykes rebounded Cedric Ceballos' 
miss in the final seconds and went up for a two-handed reverse dunk. An 
official called a foul on the play. Sykes, who had made four of 11 free throws 
in the past two games, sank one with a second remaining, saving the Titans the 
humiliation of becoming the first team to lose to San Jose State's makeshift 
bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had a complaint at the end of regulation when there was no call after 
Johnson made contact with Ceballos after blocking his shot in the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State may have had a complaint at the end of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I got fouled," Sykes said. "I didn't really feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that this San Jose State II team has improved so much that some 
suggest it is a rival to San Jose State I. Never mind that Fullerton was only a 
3 1/2-point favorite according to one published line. 
</P>
<P>
A loss would have meant jubilation for San Jose, humiliation for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Games like this, you wish nobody lost," said Berry, whom the boycotting 
players accused of extreme verbal abuse. "Under the situation, under the 
circumstances, I may be doubly disappointed that we couldn't get over the hump 
just for the kids. I certainly could have used the boost too." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which has had its own troubles with the resignation of Coach George 
McQuarn shortly before the season started and the departure of several players, 
could sympathize -- to a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sympathy toward them because of their situation," said Derek Jones, who 
along with Ceballos had 19 points to lead the Titans. Mark Hill added 16. "But 
I want to go out and win just like they do. Those other teams were trying to 
beat us as badly as possible. . . . It was a strange feeling. San Jose is in a 
kind of situation like we were in at the beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"No one wants to be the first to lose to them. No one wants to make the mistake 
that costs us the game." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which beat San Jose State, 82-60, in the hastily assembled team's 
debut last month, could only praise the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
"Berry has done an excellent job coaching these kids," Fullerton Coach John 
Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones said the team had improved "maybe 100%." 
</P>
<P>
Craig McPherson led San Jose with 20 points, and Dwain Daniels added 17. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a day to practice before," Jones said. "There's not much you can 
teach in a day. They've had a month now. They're a team I think should be 
watched out for in the conference tournament. They could get somebody." 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Titans (12-11, 7-7) equaled their win total of last 
season, when they went 12-17. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had to hang on to win despite shooting 56% in the game, its highest 
percentage so far this season. The Titans took a 27-13 lead at the outset, 
making 12 of their first 13 shots, with the only miss because of offensive 
basket interference. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose trailed by only three at halftime, but was down by 10 with 12 minutes 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
"You just need a break, somebody to make a big play," Berry said. "I'll be 
darned if we didn't defend the heck out of Ceballos at the end, and he shot a 
short airball. Then, gosh darn, Sykes came up with it, put it in and of course 
the official called the foul so we didn't get into another overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we gotten that last airball rebound, the ball would have been ours. We'd 
get fouled, maybe, and make our free throws, maybe. . . . There are a million 
things you can say, 'What if, what if,' Berry said. "I'll be doing that 
tonight. I just hope (the players) don't."

HERDMAN, MULLIGAN GET WELL AT FRESNO STATE WITH 82-79 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FRESNO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days ago, Jeff Herdman was violently ill with intestinal flu. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he felt much better. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years ago, Bill Mulligan referred to Fresno State's deliberate style of 
play as "vomit basketball" and the UC Irvine coach has left this town feeling a 
little sick ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he felt much, much better. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, a sophomore sharpshooter from Mission Viejo, scored a career-high 29 
points and UC Irvine beat Fresno State for the first time ever at Selland 
Arena, rallying for an 82-79 Big West Conference victory in front of 10,159. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, who leads the nation in three-point field goal percentage, made 10 of 
13 shots from the floor -- including five of eight from three-point range -- 
but it was his five-foot bank shot with 6 seconds left in the game that 
propelled the Anteaters to the victory . . . not to mention making Mulligan's 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a big deal for me, you know that," Mulligan deadpanned. "It was 
just another game." 
</P>
<P>
Even freshman Brian McCloskey, who didn't play in the game, knew better. He 
smuggled the game ball into the locker room and presented it to Mulligan, who 
is now overjoyed to be 1-8 in Selland Arena, home of the fanatically faithful 
Red Wave. Irvine is 1-11 in the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"All we ever heard is how Coach is 0 for life in this place," senior point 
guard Kevin Floyd said. "When we came here to practice he told us that if he 
got tense and started yelling, not to take it personal because this place makes 
him a little crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (11-12 overall, 8-6 in the Big West) trailed by seven (43-36) at 
halftime, but the Anteaters rallied and went ahead, 80-77, when Floyd 
reverse-pivoted and buried a fallaway 15-foot jumper with 1:33 left. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman had a chance to put the game away, but missed the front end of a 
one-and-one situation with 33 seconds remaining and Mulligan admitted that, at 
that point, he "felt it slipping away." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of slips . . . 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I stepped to the line, I thought, 'I've got to get this one for 
Coach Mulligan,' " Herdman said. "Then the ball slipped off the side of my hand 
and I knew I'd missed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt much better tonight, a little weak but fine really, and I wanted to 
shoot every time I got the ball. I felt like I couldn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters shot 56% from the floor, no small feat considering that Fresno 
State (12-11, 7-7) is ranked 13th in the nation in field-goal percentage 
defense, holding opponents to just 42% going into Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs held a whopping 15-5 rebounding advantage at the intermission, but 
the Anteaters held their own on the boards in the second half (19-18). When 
Fresno center Derrick Barden fouled out with 12:32 left in the game, the 
Bulldogs no longer were dominant underneath. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of people strung out in the second half and didn't rebound very 
well," Fresno Coach Ron Adams said. "I think that was a really critical factor. 
</P>
<P>
"And to beat Irvine, you have to control their offense and score at a 
consistent rate yourself. You have to get up on their shooters and disrupt 
their rhythm. That certainly wasn't the case with Herdman. They were relaxed on 
offense and we were rushing things." 
</P>
<P>
Guards Floyd and Rod Palmer were a combined nine of 18 from the field and each 
scored 11 points. Ricky Butler made six of 10 shots and scored 12. And center 
Mike Doktorczyk, who had a game-high eight rebounds, made 10 of 11 free throws 
and had 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
The hot shooting of Herdman and Co. was a key to this victory, no doubt, but 
the Anteaters' defense (surprise, surprise) was also an important factor. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs opened the game in a three-guard offense, but it was more like a 
one-forward offense in the early going. Fresno forward Jervis Cole scored 10 of 
the Bulldogs' first 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
But a quartet of Anteaters -- Floyd, brothers Mike and Rob Doktorczyk and Mike 
Labat -- combined to shut him down after that. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, who finished with a team-high 20 points but made just nine of 24 field 
goal attempts, missed eight consecutive shots in a 13-minute stretch of the 
second half as Irvine rallied. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno put together a 12-3 run after Irvine had grabbed a 54-52 lead and the 
Bulldogs led, 64-57, with 10:24 to play. But the Anteaters battled back to 
within one (75-74) when Herdman nailed a 21-footer with 4:11 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"After Herdman made the little jumper at the end to put us up by three, I was 
scared to death somebody was going to hit one," Mulligan said. "It's hard as 
hell to get a win here." 
</P>
<P>
Cole did get off one last shot, a three-point attempt at the buzzer, but he had 
to throw it up over the outstretched arms of 6-foot-9 Mike Doktorczyk and it 
wasn't close. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, I had tears in my eyes," Mulligan finally admitted. "But, hell, I cry 
every time we win one."

TITANS JUGGLE THEIR BATTING ORDER, RALLY FOR 7-5 VICTORY OVER ARIZONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cal State Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell made a couple of changes in his lineup 
Saturday and it paid off in a 7-5 nonconference victory over Arizona in front 
of about 700 at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
Cochell moved Mate Borgogno from the No. 8 spot to leadoff in place of Bobby 
Jones, who moved into Borgogno's former spot. 
</P>
<P>
Borgogno responded with three hits, scored two runs and had a key RBI. He 
raised his team-leading batting average to .448. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also fared well in his new spot, getting two hits and scoring a run. 
Jones also made an outstanding catch in center field to save two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona got three runs in the fifth to take a 5-3 lead, but Fullerton rallied 
with one in the sixth, two in the seventh and one in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh, Fullerton's Trevor Neighbors and Rex Peters singled with one 
out. Arizona starter Jason Hisey was replaced by left-hander Jim Richardson, 
who was brought in to face left-handed hitting catcher Brent Mayne. 
</P>
<P>
Mayne spoiled the move with a single to right field to score Neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Peters scored the go-ahead run when right fielder Don Parker had trouble 
picking up the ball. Parker, who was charged with an error, didn't see Peters 
rounding third and threw the ball to second base. Peters had singled in the 
first to extend his hitting streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton added a run in the eighth when Jones doubled to the fence in right, 
went to third on a throwing error by Parker and scored on a double by Borgogno. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Colarusso, a junior right-hander from Orange Coast College, worked the 
final 3 2/3 innings to get the victory. Colarusso (1-0) allowed one hit and no 
runs. He has worked seven innings this season and has not allowed a run for 
Fullerton (5-3). 
</P>
<P>
Hisey (5-1) took the loss for Arizona (13-3). 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton got two runs in the first on an RBI single by Mayne and an RBI 
groundout by Dave Staton. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona countered with two runs in the second and it looked as if the Wildcats 
would score again in the third. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats had runners on first and second with two outs when J.T. Snow, a 
sophomore from Los Alamitos High School, lined the ball deep to center. But 
Jones made an over-the-shoulder catch as he slammed into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 3-2 lead with a run in the third. Borgogno tripled to left and 
Neighbors followed with a sacrifice fly to center field. 
</P>
<P>
In other nonconference games: 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State 4, Irvine 3 -- San Diego State scored two runs in the ninth 
inning at San Diego. With two outs, Brian Cunn singled to right-center, driving 
in both runs for San Diego State (8-2), ranked 25th in the nation. John Skaggs 
and Stacy Parker each had two hits to lead Irvine (2-7-1). 
</P>
<P>
Southern California College 24, Grand Canyon 15 -- Denny Berni's grand slam 
sparked an 11-run third inning for the Vanguards (4-3) in Phoenix. Alex Andrade 
added a two-run home run in the third.

SLAYER ACQUITTED IN ESCAPE EXPECTS JAIL IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MITCHELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after his stunning acquittal on escape charges, convicted murderer Ivan 
Von Staich said Saturday that he expects the impact of his case to be widely 
felt and result in improved conditions for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich, 32, convicted in 1983 of killing a Santa Ana man and bludgeoning 
his wife, said that what he called random beatings and other mistreatment of 
prisoners in local detention facilities should diminish as a result of the 
jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich, who acted as his own lawyer during the trial that ended Friday in 
Orange County Superior Court, could have had 6 years added to his 
37-year-to-life sentence if he had been convicted. He used an obscure legal 
defense that allows for acquittal if a prison escapee can prove that his life 
was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict, a jail spokesman called the acquittal "absolutely 
astounding." Jail officials could not be reached for comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I believe that the results of this case will help other inmates from 
being attacked and beaten by guards," Von Staich said. "At least now they'll 
think twice about their actions." 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich, who broke out of the main men's jail in Santa Ana on Jan. 26, 1986, 
with inmate Robert J. Clark, 23, of Palm Springs, said he escaped from the 
facility because he was regularly beaten by jail guards from the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich employed a rare legal strategy called the "defense of necessity," 
claiming that he had no choice but to flee the brutality of jail conditions. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in jail, Von Staich said he is pleased with the outcome of the 
trial but cannot wait for his transfer back to a state prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I am transferred to a state prison, I don't expect to run into this kind 
of behavior. The guards respect you and they do their jobs by the rules. They 
know the policies and the regulations. Essentially, everyone knows where they 
stand," Von Staich said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 24 hours since the acquittal, Von Staich said, guards in the Orange 
County facility have shown mixed reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can tell that they have a lot of resentment. They were saying things to me 
like the jury was a panel full of idiots and that the district attorney did a 
(poor) job. They were making a lot stupid comments like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich said many of the younger guards at the jail want to prove themselves 
to their peers and establish their authority over inmates. He said beatings are 
one tactic of new guards. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had inmates killed in this jail. Usually it's the younger guards, but 
not always. The worst shift is the night shift. They don't seem to be as busy 
as the day or swing shift guards. Most of the beatings happen between the hours 
of midnight and 6 a.m. They'll come drag you out of your tank, take you to a 
back room and beat the (expletive) out of you," Von Staich said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I think that the guards realize that they are not dealing with just 
another member of the inmate population. They know that I won't put up with 
their abuse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich said he spent months preparing his defense, hiring and firing three 
attorneys and making use of the jail's limited law library. Von Staich said he 
had little formal education but asked to represent himself to show the jury 
that he "was not a monster but a human being." 
</P>
<P>
"When people take a look at my size, my beard and my long hair they associate 
me with Charles Manson. I'm not like that at all. I am not a violent person. I 
wanted to make sure that the jury saw this," Von Staich said. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial before Superior Court Judge Linda Hodge McLaughlin, jurors were 
told that Von Staich is a convicted felon but not that he is a convicted 
murderer. 
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't have considered this case or this defense for a minute had they 
known about my conviction," Von Staich said. 
</P>
<P>
Von Staich was convicted in 1985 of the attempted murder of his girlfriend, 
Cynthia Topper, and the murder of her husband, Richard. According to court 
records, Von Staich kicked in the door of the Toppers' Santa Ana home and beat 
Robert Topper with a claw hammer and then shot him three times. He then beat 
Cynthia Topper with the hammer, causing brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Although the jury agreed with Von Staich that he had suffered beatings, they 
did not believe all of his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the jurors disregarded Von Staich's assertion that a deputy 
sheriff had been bribed to help with the escape. Von Staich said the deputy, 
for a fee of $10,000, agreed to help him and Clark escape. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Overtoom argued that Von Staich's defense was 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the 200-pound-plus man had been severely beaten in jail, 
Overtoom said Von Staich weakened his own special defense by failing to report 
the beatings. Von Staich also showed no intention to give himself up after he 
had escaped. In fact, Von Staich was a fugitive for about 4 weeks before being 
arrested on loitering charges in Massachusetts, the prosecutor argued. 
</P>
<P>
Overtoom also argued that Von Staich did not prove the defense applied to him 
because he did not try to get help for any life-threatening situation while 
suffering the beatings. Von Staich also failed to immediately report to 
officials once he was safely out of the jail.

SANTA ANA PROGRAM NOT ONLY FINDS LOW-COST HOUSING FOR THE DISPLACED, IT MAKES 
THEM A PART OF THE SOLUTION

<P>
Ricardo Olivo and his family were in dire straits a few months ago when their 
landlord raised the rent on their dilapidated, three-bedroom Santa Ana house 
from $900 to an unmanageable $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
The Olivos, a family of six, were on the verge of joining the ranks of 
impoverished Santa Ana families forced to share living quarters -- or, if 
things got desperate, to live in their cars or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
But neither happened. Instead, the Olivos, who have three children in school, 
obtained a two-bedroom apartment on West Myrtle Street for $650 a month -- 
thanks to the nonprofit Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., a group formed by 
displaced residents a decade ago to provide families with low-cost housing in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Had No Place to Go' 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for them," said Olivo, a custodian at a swimwear factory in Tustin. 
"We had to leave, and we had no place to go." 
</P>
<P>
The apartment is one of 58 units in the city that Civic Center Barrio owns or 
helped develop. Although that number may not make a huge dent in the low-cost 
housing crunch in central Orange County, the group has had a powerful impact on 
the lives of dozens of Santa Ana residents. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Herman, who lived on the streets for 3 years before he got a 
room in a five-bedroom house that the corporation owns in east Santa Ana. He 
says he would still be on the streets without Civic Center Barrio's help. 
</P>
<P>
"They picked me up," says Herman, 60, who declined to give his last name. He 
now works part time for the corporation, helping take care of the properties, 
and pays $225 a month for his room. "I think that if a corporation like this 
existed in every city in the U.S., there wouldn't be so many people out there 
on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
There are corporations like Civic Center Barrio in other California cities -- 
mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area -- and their number in Los Angeles County 
is growing. 
</P>
<P>
But in Orange County, Civic Center Barrio remains unique. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community-based group that became a housing developer," said Helen 
Brown, executive director of Civic Center Barrio. The only other nonprofit 
housing developer in the county, the Orange County Community Housing Corp., has 
built about 80 inexpensive apartment units countywide, but without the kind of 
input from low-income residents that characterizes Civic Center Barrio. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Such Groups Are Badly Needed 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Whitaker, who manages the city of Santa Ana's housing programs, said 
groups like Civic Center Barrio are badly needed. 
</P>
<P>
"They are successful," Whitaker said. "They have really persevered to create a 
large number of affordable units." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Santa Ana suffers from a severe shortage of low-income rental housing. 
</P>
<P>
The city provides assistance, through federal housing subsidy programs, to 
about 1,500 families -- but it also has a growing waiting list of 3,000 more 
families. Funding for the programs has remained flat the last few years, yet 
the population has grown, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal spending on Housing and Urban Development programs increased only 
marginally during the last 8 years. HUD officials say outlays have increased 
from $14 billion in 1981 to $18.6 billion in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Separate studies have shown that California has the worst rental-affordability 
problem in America, with a bigger shortage of low-priced apartments than any 
other state, according to the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Some people may have to wait 5 or 6 years under one of the programs, Whitaker 
said. "There's no turnover." 
</P>
<P>
Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. was born out of the destruction of a 
neighborhood of low-income housing in Santa Ana in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downtown Redevelopment 
</P>
<P>
The city was just embarking on its ambitious campaign to redevelop the downtown 
area, and one of its first targets was the dilapidated neighborhood along Third 
Street between Ross and Flower streets -- home to about 300 families, most of 
them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager David N. Ream, who was then head of the city's redevelopment 
agency, called it "probably the worst residential blight in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The city's plans called for the houses in Civic Center Barrio, as the 
neighborhood came to be known, to be razed and replaced by a 316-unit apartment 
complex. But barrio residents, aided by community organizers and the Western 
Center on Law and Poverty, protested. So the city agreed to improve its 
relocation benefits, and promised to set aside and subsidize 58 of the new 
apartments for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1979, project developers decided it would be more profitable if the new 
apartment units were sold as condominiums, leaving the low-income tenants out 
of the picture. The city agreed. A lawsuit followed, and the following year the 
developers agreed to pay Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp. -- which the 
residents had voted to form that year to represent their interests -- $1.4 
million in lieu of the 58 low-income units they had promised to build. 
</P>
<P>
"Those (families) could have taken the money . . . and split it up," Brown 
said. Instead, the money gave Civic Center Barrio the means to do something 
concrete with its political muscle, she said. "All of a sudden, we were no 
longer just a community organization." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartments Acquired 
</P>
<P>
With the money, the corporation set out to replace the stock of low-income 
housing that had been lost in the redevelopment project. A 12-unit project was 
bought and renovated on Raitt Street. Eight more existing apartments, including 
some four- and five-bedroom units that could comfortably house some of the 
corporation's large families, were bought on West Washington Street. 
</P>
<P>
And the corporation kept building up its housing stock incrementally. In 1984, 
it completed an attention-getting project in west Santa Ana in which 20 
prospective condominium owners gained "sweat equity" by working nights and 
weekends to build their own units. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very hard; don't get me wrong," Oscar Tovar, one of the condo owners, 
said recently. "But it gives me such a sense of responsibility. . . . I just 
can't sell it." Brown, who came into contact with the corporation as a county 
social services worker in the late 1970s, has led Civic Center Barrio to firmer 
financial ground since taking over as director in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonprofit doesn't mean you're stupid and don't make a profit," Brown said. 
"Nonprofit means you don't pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Brown seems to be more comfortable on the streets of Santa Ana's westside, 
talking in broken Spanish with longtime residents or jiving with the area 
homeless, than she is at a board meeting or City Council session. 
</P>
<P>
And it is her firsthand familiarity with Santa Ana's problems that has enabled 
her to emerge with legitimacy as one of the city's most outspoken advocates for 
the homeless. Her argument is that self-managed, low-cost housing is the only 
long-term solution to homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
"Homelessness is a situation where there's a lack of affordable housing," Brown 
said. "We do affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the corporation's tenants were homeless before being given a chance 
to rent a room or apartment in a Civic Center Barrio project. In some cases, 
Brown lets new tenants work for the corporation to pay part of the rent until 
they can find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always something that needs doing," she said. And giving people a 
stake in how their projects are run gives them something to be proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"Given quality housing and an opportunity to learn, I believe people will come 
up with solutions far better than what people outside the neighborhood can do," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Participation Is Key 
</P>
<P>
Condominium owner Tovar agrees that the participation of residents is the key 
to the corporation's success. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a charity organization," said Tovar, one of six low-income residents 
on the corporation's board of directors. "It's helping people help themselves. 
Once people get their break, it's up to them if they can keep going." 
</P>
<P>
Tovar, an immigrant from Mexicali who works at a Lucky supermarkets 
distribution center, said he was unsure of himself when first asked to serve on 
the corporation's board. "I thought, 'What could they want me for? What could I 
do for them?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Tovar agreed to join, and today he stands alongside Brown in her ongoing 
battle with the city for more housing funds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tovar: "I love the program. . . . I am proud to the max." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the corporation has a six-unit project under construction and has plans 
to start another owner-built condominium project. It is also trying to build a 
housing complex for the elderly, but so far has been unable to secure the 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has asked the city to allocate $300,000 of next year's Community 
Development Block Grant funds to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The city subsidizes big developers with public-works projects all the time," 
Brown said. "If they could do the same thing proportionately for us, that might 
make or break . . . the project." 
</P>
<P>
Annie Holloway is typical of the tenants the project would help. Holloway, 85, 
lives with her sister, Louise Killebrew, in one room of a house on 2nd Street 
next to the planned housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
The sisters pay $200 monthly rent for the room. Holloway said they cannot 
afford an apartment at market rates, but they can manage the $300 that Brown 
estimates a unit in the new project might cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying to get one," said Holloway, who is on Civic Center Barrio's list 
for the project. She has rented rooms in Santa Ana houses for years, she said, 
but is not fond of it. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway would like nothing better than to live out her life with her sister in 
one of the new apartments for the elderly. "I think I need a place of my own."

REALTY RIVAL SOUGHT FOR QUESTIONING IN KILLING OF SEAL BEACH BROKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BEENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The search for the killer of a successful Long Beach real estate broker who was 
shot in the head and stuffed in the trunk of her car centered Saturday on a 
rival broker who disappeared the day of the slaying, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vicente Lapid OCampo, 45, was being sought by police for questioning in the 
shooting death of Arlene Lee Chee of Seal Beach, who was found Thursday night 
in the trunk of her Mercedes-Benz just a few blocks from OCampo's Long Beach 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Police and family members said Chee, 46, disappeared Wednesday after leaving 
her realty office for a noon appointment with OCampo. 
</P>
<P>
Chee, owner of Century 21 Fortune Realty in Long Beach, was found by members of 
her family Thursday shortly after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Family Members Searched 
</P>
<P>
About 30 members of the family had fanned out across Long Beach looking for the 
small, quiet women until her white Mercedes-Benz coupe was found on Fashion 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
A family member flagged down a police car, and an officer opened the trunk, 
where Chee was found. She had been shot once in the head, police said. 
</P>
<P>
OCampo worked with Chee before starting his own brokerage firm, Realty One, 
about 6 years ago. Long Beach Detective Ron Pavek would reveal few details 
about the case, except to say he was seeking an arrest warrant for OCampo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Have Argued 
</P>
<P>
Police said earlier that OCampo and Chee may have been arguing over a real 
estate agent who had left OCampo's office to go to work for Chee 2 weeks ago. 
That employee, identified by family members as Corine Bolden, could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
At OCampo's Realty One office in Long Beach, the telephone went unanswered 
Saturday, and OCampo's wife could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo OCampo, the suspect's brother and a real estate agent on the west side 
of Long Beach, said only that he was "shocked. I cannot make any presumptions. 
What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
Manolita OCampo, the suspect's wife, met with Pavek and other investigators 
Saturday morning but said she had no idea where her husband had gone. 
</P>
<P>
"The last Mrs. OCampo saw of her husband was at work on Wednesday," said 
Leonard Matsuk, the OCampo family lawyer. "She is quite upset and disturbed 
that he is missing. She has satisfied the police officers that she knows 
nothing about what has occurred. She is more than happy to cooperate, but 
unfortunately she doesn't know much. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless and until Mr. OCampo is arrested or surfaces, we are not sure what his 
plans are." 
</P>
<P>
Matsuk said the suspect's wife knew nothing about a dispute between Chee and 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"We understood that he was on friendly terms with the victim," Matsuk said. "It 
appears to me that Mrs. OCampo didn't keep current with the day-to-day affairs 
of the business. Apparently Mr. OCampo didn't feel it was necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Minks, a broker in Chee's Long Beach office for the past 6 years, said he 
had talked to Bolden Thursday night and that she did not know anything about 
Chee's death. He said Bolden joined Century 21 Fortune Realty because there was 
not enough business at OCampo's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$30 Million in Sales 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Minks said, Chee's Long Beach office had received a special 
citation from Century 21 for doing $30 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
Minks called Chee "very businesslike but very kind and giving. You couldn't ask 
for a better person to work for. I can't even sleep at night thinking about it. 
We were close friends. Everyone is very upset about this." 
</P>
<P>
As police searched for OCampo, members of the extended Chee family gathered at 
the victim's house and at the realty office to mourn their loss and make 
funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just kind of regrouping now," said Alan Chee, the victim's 
brother-in-law. Alan Chee met with some of the real estate agents who worked 
for the victim Saturday morning and told them that "it is business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a normal workday," he said. "Life goes back to normal. We are just trying 
to put the place back together now. Her husband (Eugene Chee) has talked to all 
the (real estate) agents." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Chee described his sister-in-law, who had four children, was "a very 
dynamic person and very well liked. She built this business from the grass 
roots. The office is one of the best in Long Beach -- residential, apartments 
and income property." 
</P>
<P>
Chee said the family had been told by police that OCampo was a suspect and that 
there was speculation that OCampo may have been angry because the victim had 
lured Bolden over to her office. 
</P>
<P>
"But we just don't know for sure, and I don't want to second-guess anything," 
he said. "I can only speculate, but we heard it was something about an agent. 
I'm very anxious to find out what this Vic OCampo has to say." 
</P>
<P>
He said the victim's four children were "not doing real well because they are 
in grief. But they are strong and they will come out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Matsuk, the OCampo family lawyer, said he had heard reports that OCampo had a 
quick temper but "I don't know anything of that. He was a successful real 
estate broker in Long Beach and he had several agents working for him. He had a 
couple of minor scrapes that have been cleared up, but nothing extraordinary. I 
didn't know that he had a temper."

JUPITER SPACE MISSION TAKES SMALL STEP; 
</P>
<P>
ATMOSPHERIC PROBE MOVING CLOSER TO GALILEO SPACECRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, Times Science Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One key scientist has died and several others have retired while waiting for 
the often-delayed Galileo spacecraft to blast off for Jupiter, but success 
moved a little closer last week when a probe that will dash through the Jovian 
atmosphere was packaged for a trip across town. 
</P>
<P>
It was a small step perhaps. But for the men and women who have grown gray and 
weary while waiting for their mission to get off the ground, any progress is to 
be cherished. 
</P>
<P>
Built by the Space and Communications Group of Hughes Aircraft Co., the small 
probe was to be trucked from El Segundo to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory near 
Pasadena. The probe will be carried to Jupiter aboard JPL's Galileo spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime between Oct. 12 and Nov. 21, Galileo is scheduled to be carried to low 
Earth orbit by the space shuttle. Originally, the craft was to use powerful 
liquid-fueled rockets to blast itself from Earth orbit to Jupiter, but 
heightened safety concerns over cargo carried aboard the shuttle compelled the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to switch to less powerful -- but 
safer -- solid rockets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Tortured Route 
</P>
<P>
That means Galileo will have to follow a tortured route, flying first to Venus 
and using the gravity of Venus to pick up speed and fling it back toward Earth. 
Then it will fly past Earth twice, using the Earth's gravity to boost its speed 
more, finally sending it on toward the distant planet. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will be more than 2.4 billion miles, and the craft will not reach 
Jupiter until December of 1995. But for a lot of scientists who have feared 
many times over the last few years that the entire project was going to be 
scrapped, 1995 is better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Technical and scheduling problems had already delayed the project a couple of 
years even before the space shuttle Challenger exploded, delaying it even 
further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wisdom Questioned 
</P>
<P>
The wisdom of proceeding with the mission has been questioned by NASA 
executives "at least once every year," said Joel Sperans, chief of the space 
exploration project for NASA's Ames Research Center. "We've had a lot of 
challenges, but they are behind us. I'm confident we will make it now." 
</P>
<P>
But for many who have devoted considerable portions of their careers to the 
project, which began in 1976, it has not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of wear and tear on the bodies as well as the hardware," 
said Benny Chin, program manager for Ames. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Boese, principal investigator for one of the probe's six instruments, 
died in December of 1986. Other scientists have retired, and many others just 
drifted away to other agencies after growing weary over the seemingly endless 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a very long program," said John Radecki, program manager at Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
During the lengthy delays, the mission has been "reprogrammed" six times. But 
if successful, the $1.36-billion mission will give scientists their first look 
at an asteroid, and it will tell much about the giant, gaseous planet known as 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Main Parts 
</P>
<P>
Galileo consists primarily of two parts: Ames Research Center's atmospheric 
probe, which will plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at 107,000 miles an hour, 
and JPL's mother ship, which will orbit the planet for about 20 months, sending 
back data for that entire period. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a scientifically rich mission," said Richard Spehalski of JPL, who is the 
overall project manager. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 days before Galileo reaches the planet, the 4-foot-diameter 
atmospheric probe will separate from the main spacecraft. As the probe rips 
through the planet's atmosphere, it will slow down so quickly that 
"deceleration" forces will be equal to 350 times that of the gravitational pull 
of Earth. That will have the effect of making the 745-pound probe weigh as much 
as a DC-10 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
For 75 minutes, the probe will plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere. Sometime after 
passing through the first layers of clouds, the probe will be crushed by the 
dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
But before that happens, it will have sent back enormous amounts of data, 
scientists hope. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "mother ship" will continue to study the planet and its four 
moons, making 10 orbits of the giant planet and sending back about 50,000 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, at least one other significant hurdle to overcome. Like all 
deep space probes, Galileo will use radioisotopes to generate the electricity 
it will need to run its instruments. And since it requires White House approval 
to launch any spacecraft with radioactive materials aboard, the mission must 
now undergo intensive review by several federal agencies before the President's 
approval for launch can even be requested. 
</P>
<P>
Spehalski, the project director, said he expects that approval to be granted in 
September -- the month before the scheduled launch.

Orange County proved itself something of a wrestling powerhouse at the Southern 
Section 2-A championships at Nogales High School Saturday by placing three 
schools in the top 10 and producing four individual champions. 
</P>
<P>
Atascadero won the team championship before the final round started and 
finished with 118 1/2 points. Laguna Hills was second with 91, Buena Park was 
third with 88 1/2 and Mater Dei finished fifth with 78 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
Heath Sims of Woodbridge, a state champion last year in the 132-pound division, 
won the 138-pound division with a pin of Mater Dei's Troy Monge with 1 minute 
45 seconds left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"I had seen him wrestle before, but I never wrestled him," Sims said. "I 
thought he would be a little stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Sims seemed to wear down Monge, who had an attacking style but had difficulty 
maintaining advantages against Sims. 
</P>
<P>
Sims was stronger and has wrestled in the 145- and 154-pound divisions this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Three other county wrestlers won their weight titles: Greg Andres of Sunny 
Hills (105), Brian Bertrand of Buena Park (126) and Gabino Aguilar of Orange 
(132). ARA NAJARIAN

EL DORADO HOLDS OFF CANYON TO WIN 4-A CHAMPIONSHIP

Canyon High School's Zach Cooper and El Dorado's Brian Tomazic met in the 
191-pound final of the Southern Section 4-A championships at Edison High. Six 
minutes later, each of them walked off the mat part winner, part loser. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Cooper and Tomazic stepped on the mat, El Dorado held a 128-122 
lead in the team standings. Only a pin by Cooper, ranked No. 1 in the state at 
his weight, would give Canyon the necessary six points to tie El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper won the match, but he didn't pin Tomazic. Cooper was the individual 
champion, but Tomazic clinched the title for his team. The final was El Dorado 
128, Canyon 126. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon, two-time defending 4-A champion, came into Saturday's finals ranked No. 
1 in the division; El Dorado was No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy and disappointed at the same time," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper knew coming in that pinning Tomazic was "a longshot at best." 
</P>
<P>
Tomazic comes from one of the most distinguished high school wrestling families 
in Southern Section history. Brother Todd was a two-time state champion, who 
made his name on being able to wriggle out of any hold. He was so good that he 
was dubbed Gumby. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian has the same style as Todd," Cooper said. "They're looking for you to 
make mistakes. Every move I tried, he stopped me." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third Southern Section team championship for El Dorado, who also had 
Pat Kinney reach the finals at 126 pounds. Kinney lost to M.T. Merickel of 
Channel Islands, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is especially sweet since we beat Canyon," said Frank Gonzales, El 
Dorado coach. 
</P>
<P>
In all, six of the top 10 teams were from Orange County, including the top 
four. After El Dorado and Canyon came Esperanza (99 1/2) and Edison (94). 
Katella (83) was sixth and San Clemente (80) was seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's David Niedringhaus defeated San Clemente's Jason Booth, 6-3, to win 
the 105-pound title. Niedringhaus had a 4-1 lead going into the third period, 
but Booth got a reverse to pull within 4-3. But Niedringhaus pulled off a 
reverse of his own late in the period to pad his score. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's Rob Langenwalter provided the final's best finish when he performed 
an escape with a second left to beat San Clemente's Chris Wilyard, 5-4, in the 
117-pound final. It was the second Southern Section championship for 
Langenwalter. 
</P>
<P>
Another two-time winner was Katella's Joe Pastorello, who beat Westlake's Bill 
Hunter, 8-1, to win the 175-pound championship. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's Nathan Kerley had the only pin in the finals when he put down 
Esperanza's Dan Shaffer 5:46 into their 138-pound match. 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Kenny Richards squeaked out a 3-2 victory over Westlake's Neil Mason 
in the 145-pound final.

KEEPING A SECRET;

<P>
ROCKWELL'S NEW 'STAR WARS' FACILITY IN SEAL BEACH IS DESIGNED TO FOIL SPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Inside Building No. 90, a portable radio blares rock music as construction 
workers put the finishing touches on the most secretive defense plant ever 
built by Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of Bob Seger seems somehow incongruous with the serious purpose of 
this $30-million structure: the development of top-secret plans for the "Star 
Wars" missile-defense program. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly completed four-story structure at Rockwell's Seal Beach facility is 
the centerpiece of the company's effort to land lucrative "Star Wars" 
contracts. Called the Strategic Defense Center, it is also part of an ambitious 
corporate experiment aimed at finding a better way to manage large, complex 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the future of the controversial "Star Wars" program is far from 
certain, Rockwell is convinced that its investment in the Strategic Defense 
Center will be money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell executives believe that in one form or another, "Star Wars" technology 
will be around for a long time. Like earlier space programs, they said, the 
research effort is expected to serve as the engine for many new technological 
breakthroughs with applications for other projects at the $12-billion aerospace 
and defense firm. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has assembled at the center a group consisting of hundreds of top 
engineers, scientists and computer experts -- many of whom were teamed together 
on the Apollo space program 2 decades ago. About 1,000 people will work at the 
center when it is fully staffed. 
</P>
<P>
The personnel assigned to the center will come mostly from Rockwell's other 
divisions throughout Southern California, where the company employs 35,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
They will work inside a mostly windowless facility with an array of security 
precautions reminiscent of scenes from a spy thriller. 
</P>
<P>
The building is a bewildering maze of stark hallways, soundproof rooms and 
offices protected by high-security locks, infrared sensors and double layers of 
doors. In the most sensitive areas, offices are protected by huge steel doors 
like those used in bank vaults. 
</P>
<P>
The floor, ceiling and walls are extra-thick and loaded with special materials 
to prevent radio or computer transmissions from escaping outside, where they 
might be intercepted by spies using sophisticated electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Air-conditioning ducts have been sealed off to prevent intruders from crawling 
their way into trouble. And telephone lines have been secured. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, it seems, has been taken for granted. Even a simple thing like 
reminding employees to close a door behind them warrants a sign reading: 
"Please verify door is closed. For door problems, please call immediately." 
Construction workers had to undergo security checks to ensure they didn't plant 
eavesdropping devices in the building. That precaution was taken to prevent a 
replay of what happened at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Last year, former 
President Reagan ordered the partially completed embassy torn down and 
reconstructed because the building's Soviet-made concrete casings were found to 
be riddled with listening devices. 
</P>
<P>
Access to some areas of the Rockwell facility is so difficult that center 
director George W. Jeffs, even with the use of a map, had difficulty locating 
the "battle management" program offices during a recent tour with a Times 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
The battle management program involves the development of computer systems to 
manage a "Star Wars" system. The battle management area includes large computer 
displays in which a "Star Wars" scenario could be simulated. 
</P>
<P>
The center's main purpose will be to oversee Rockwell's work on the "Star Wars" 
program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo-based Rockwell was the nation's fourth-largest SDI contractor in 
1988 and has current contracts totaling $778 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Star Wars" is a proposed space-based, anti-missile system designed to act as 
both a shield and deterrent to a Soviet nuclear attack. Viewed by supporters as 
a strategic necessity and by critics as the ultimate boondoggle, billions of 
research dollars have been poured into the program during the past 6 years. 
Some of the program's prototype systems are beginning to undergo tests, but a 
decision about deployment is years away. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Orange County defense contractors are getting a piece of the "Star 
Wars" action, including McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Huntington Beach, Hughes 
Aircraft Co. in Fullerton and Interstate Electronics Corp. in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is a prime contractor on one of the centerpiece projects for "Star 
Wars," the Space-Based Interceptor program. That project involves a satellite 
designed to fire high-energy projectiles known as "smart rocks" at ballistic 
missiles, destroying them by the speed and force of impact. The company's other 
programs include electronic sensors, high-energy lasers and computer systems to 
manage a "Star Wars" battle. 
</P>
<P>
The Space-Based Interceptor program was threatened last year after the Defense 
Acquisition Board issued an unfavorable review of the program, saying it would 
cost too much. However, recent changes in the design of the program have 
lowered its proposed costs from $52 billion to $17.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's investment in the new facility, which is expected to grow to $50 
million over the next few years, is "a practical effort to help us marshal our 
resources from throughout the corporation," said Jeffs, the center's director 
and Rockwell's executive vice president for strategic defense and technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The center represents "a new adventure in management," said Jeffs, a 42-year 
veteran of Rockwell who headed the company's work on the Apollo, Skylab and 
Space Shuttle programs. The center is unique, he said, because it is Rockwell's 
first attempt to the centralize management of programs involving many different 
divisions. Eight Rockwell units are presently involved in "Star Wars"-related 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we would try to do projects out of a particular division," Jeffs 
said. "But the expertise of any one division might not be the best of fits for 
a given job. We can tailor this organization to better match the requirements 
of some of the new jobs that don't fall naturally within the business structure 
of our existing divisions." 
</P>
<P>
By locating key personnel from various Rockwell units under a single roof, the 
corporation also hopes to foster a team spirit and eliminate problems of 
inter-division rivalries. "Co-locating people tends to totally eliminate the 
parochial self-interest" of any one division, a Rockwell official explained. 
</P>
<P>
The center will perform program management, research, design and engineering 
work for various "Star Wars" systems. But the production of test hardware will 
be done at different Rockwell units, including Seal Beach and Anaheim in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other Rockwell operations, the center won't be evaluated on the basis of 
how much it contributes to the corporation's bottom line. It will function as a 
"nonprofit" facility, with all profits gained from programs managed at the 
center being credited to the Rockwell division that performs the bulk of the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is promoting the center as the first of its kind devoted solely to 
"Star Wars" programs. Company executives believe the center's high-security 
features will prove attractive to its security-conscious customers at the 
Pentagon, providing Rockwell with a potential leg up on its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
When the company began construction of the center in May, 1987, plans called 
for a two-story, 100,000-square-foot structure -- half the size of what has 
been built. The building was designed so that two additional floors could be 
added later. 
</P>
<P>
"We very quickly realized the building size wouldn't match our requirements," 
Jeffs said. "We concluded that from an overall point of view, it would be more 
economical to finish the other two stories now rather than add on to it later." 
</P>
<P>
The Seal Beach site was chosen because it is close to several other "Star Wars" 
projects under way at the company's Satellite Systems Division and computer 
center, also in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the center was designed specifically for SDI work, Jeffs said the 
facility could be used for future classified projects if the controversial 
"Star Wars" program encounters political problems in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffs said he believes that the "Star Wars" program "for one reason or another, 
will continue for a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that SDI is a good technology driver, just like the Apollo program 
was," Jeffs said. "It offers the possibility of a number of spinoffs" to other 
military and commercial businesses in which Rockwell is involved.

WINGING IT TO ANNECY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

ANNECY, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To know Annecy is to know France's prettiest village -- but getting here, well 
... this was the adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Although barely 60 miles from Grenoble, the trip involved two hours, start to 
finish, which doubtless appears odd because the journey was by air. 
</P>
<P>
To explain, the entire episode had to do with a single-engine airplane piloted 
by Henri Giraud, who distinguished himself in 1960 as the first flier ever to 
land on Mont Blanc. That, one must agree, took an inordinate amount of bravery, 
courage, grit, skill and plain ordinary guts, particularly since there was no 
airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
This particular day Giraud had decided that we should skim over his beloved 
Alps en route to Annecy. To say that he succeeded in tempting fate on this 
occasion is a gross understatement. As a matter of fact, Giraud landed once 
again on one of the Alpine peaks. Not Mont Blanc this time, and not on a runway 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Giraud just flat-out set the little plane down on a stretch of soggy sod 
several hundred feet above the timberline, all of which brings to mind that 
expression familiar to fliers the world over: There are old pilots and there 
are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots. 
</P>
<P>
In his case, Giraud puts this notion to rest. Sixty-eight years old, he has 
been tempting fate in a flying machine for more than half a century. Not 
ordinary flying, I should point out, but daring encounters among mountain 
ranges with death dancing at his wing tips. Innocently, I got involved when I 
sought a ride to Annecy from Grenoble. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that I happen to be a devout member of the Cowards' Club, it is 
doubtful I would have joined Giraud had I known that he intended to demonstrate 
his derring-do en route from Grenoble to Annecy. Particularly as well over 100 
light planes and more than 50 helicopters have crashed in the French Alps since 
Giraud landed on Mont Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
As Giraud puts it: "It is very dangerous to play with the ground." 
</P>
<P>
This occurred to me as he flew hellbent toward an Alpine peak. I assumed 
wrongly that Giraud intended to pull back on the yoke and nose over the 
fast-approaching mountain. Instead, with Gallic savoir-faire, Giraud set the 
plane down on the mountainside in what could only be described as a soggy, 
vertical cow pasture. 
</P>
<P>
"That," said the smiling pilot with the shaved head, "takes not only skill but 
a love of the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
With a white scarf knotted around his neck, the bald, bold and personable 
Giraud brings to mind a French Kojak with the courage of a World War II 
Spitfire ace. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Giraud flew within 10 feet of a mountain ledge. One violent 
updraft or downdraft and we could very well have become familiar figures on the 
other side of eternity. Peaks slipped by under the wings. The plane pitched. 
</P>
<P>
While scanning a slope, Giraud banked sharply. He'd spotted a herd of chamoix 
kicking up sheets of snow as they raced for cover on a mountainside that is 
eternally covered with powder. Giraud overflew the ski resorts of Val d'Isere, 
Tignes, Courchevel and Meribel. 
</P>
<P>
During winter Giraud delivers skiers to peaks otherwise inaccessible. In summer 
he flies tourists alongside waterfalls and Alpine meadows carpeted with 
wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
This particular day Giraud flew low over the villages of Le Sappey and St. 
Pierre de Chartreuse, and afterward buzzed Albertville, which is to be 
headquarters for the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The sky was flawless. The little plane pitched, rose and fell. Other villages 
appeared in the folds of the French Alps. At one point Giraud circled the 
monastery where monks concoct Chartreuse, the popular liqueur that's sold the 
world over. A monk waved. Giraud dipped his wings in a salute. Villages far 
below appeared as peaceful as the snow-covered peaks surrounding them. 
</P>
<P>
Gracefully, the plane circled La Meije, a mountain Giraud described as the most 
beautiful in all of France. Spotting another herd of chamoix, he cried out: 
"Regardez!" 
</P>
<P>
The animals stampeded, setting off a minor avalanche as they fled toward a 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
The old pilot smiled. "We fly now to Annecy." 
</P>
<P>
The adventure was over, another was beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring the Old Town of Annecy is one of the joys of a visit to the Rhone 
Alps. France's prettiest village, with its narrow canals and cobbled streets 
and ancient houses, appears like a Renoir canvas come to life. Swans glide 
through the water alongside sidewalk cafes, and small bridges span the 
waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Should there be a chill, diners retire inside to cafes and the welcome warmth 
of fires and steaming cups of espresso. Otherwise, they remain at tables 
alongside the canals, photographing the swans or tossing scraps of bread onto 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Town of Annecy is particularly appealing to artists who set up their 
easels along the Quai du Semnoz, Quai Perriere, Quai des Vielles Prisons, Quai 
de l'Eveche and Quai du l'Isle. 
</P>
<P>
With brush in hand they capture passers-by crossing bridges that arch over the 
canals, and they paint the castle that looks down on the village, appearing as 
if it had been created by the Brothers Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
Window boxes profuse with geraniums face other blooms lining the canals. Hand 
in hand, couples stroll Annecy's twisting, cobbled streets. (Why, one asks, do 
lovers always hold hands?) 
</P>
<P>
It is indeed a town that attracts lovers. For generations, poets have sung its 
praises. Rising from the waters of the Thiou Canal, the Palais de l'Isle faces 
paths lined with ancient homes. Red-tile roofs and old walls are reflected by 
the canals. 
</P>
<P>
Were I young and in love, I would take a room at the little Hotel de Savoie 
next door to the 17th-Century Church of St. Francois de Sales. Its entrance is 
bright with roses and geraniums, and inside the parlor this particular day a 
cat snoozed beside the proprietor who sipped wine and read. 
</P>
<P>
The Savoie is not elegant. The fact of the matter is, it's a trifle shopworn. 
But throw open the shutter of one's room on one of the upper levels and, alors, 
the scene seems lifted from a Mastroianni movie. One particular corner room 
looks down on the Thiou Canal and above to Annecy's splendid old castle on the 
hillside. 
</P>
<P>
So it is not pretentious. But it is romantic, what with the view and the 
setting next door to the Church of Saint Francois de Sales. This is what plays 
on the heartstrings. Besides, at 200 francs per couple, the Savoie is possibly 
the best buy in Annecy. (Ask for a corner room facing the canal with its lineup 
of amber lamps.) 
</P>
<P>
Pure amour. 
</P>
<P>
The same pair of lovers would do well to take a meal at Restaurant Le Vieux 
Necy (3 Rue Filaterie) where timbered ceilings, red tablecloths and candles set 
the mood. The candles glow in the shadows of the 10th-Century structure, while 
an ancient clock plays melodies at a window facing the Canal St. Dominique. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, Hotel du Coin Fleuri provides more Old World atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Others dine at L'Auberge du Lyonnais on River Le Thiou, a setting that inspires 
thoughts of romance. Although the meals are moderately good, the proprietor is 
a pill. Yes, ill-tempered, if not downright rude. Still, well ... the setting 
makes up for his insolence. In addition to the restaurant, this grouchy fellow 
presides over an eight-room hotel above the dining room. Try for a room on the 
canal. The others face an uninspiring street. 
</P>
<P>
In Annecy, October marks the return of the livestock from the mountains, a time 
for celebration when cows, goats and sheep parade directly through the center 
of town, all of which calls for a command performance by tourists covering the 
spectacle with their Instamatics. 
</P>
<P>
Other action takes place on Fridays and Sundays with open markets at La Place 
Santa Claire, with its fountains and brick-lined plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the fortified gates of the Old Town, with its pastel-colored buildings, 
handsome villas and resorts surround the nine-mile-long Lake Annecy. Alpine 
peaks look down on lake steamers that carry passengers on dinner sailings. 
</P>
<P>
Other visitors book reservations at L'Hotel de l'Abbaye, which, although it is 
outside the Old Town, gets top rating for its service. Four stars at the very 
least: ****. Guest rooms are spacious. The menu does justice to the most 
persnickety diner. 
</P>
<P>
On this lovers' journey, couples visiting France's prettiest town promenade 
along Quai Napoleon III and the splendid gardens of the Champ de Mars. And 
should stars get in one's eyes, well, the moment is magic -- so spend it 
wisely.

"Women have often been silenced in history, our voices discredited or blotted 
out. We have been silenced to preserve elements in the hierarchy, political or 
social, public or private, institutional or personal. I chose to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Sallie Bingham's feminist voice in the prelude to her memoir, "Passion and 
Prejudice," has the crackle of distant Confederate gunfire. The shots get 
louder as the author settles down to the business at hand, unveiling the 
secrets and wrongdoing that she believes led to Kentucky's notorious family 
feud, the war between the Binghams. By the end of her recollections, even her 
closest relatives will have been fired upon at close range. 
</P>
<P>
Two books have already been published about the downfall of the Binghams, but 
this is the first by an insider. For all its promise, "Passion and Prejudice" 
is less a revealing memoir than a scorched earth policy toward the author's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, Sallie Bingham, the daughter of the owner of the Louisville 
Courier-Journal, one of the nation's most respected newspapers, returned to her 
family after 15 years in Manhattan, two unsuccessful marriages and an erratic 
writing career. The weary prodigal daughter craved emotional security. "I was 
tired, and I was afraid," she recalls. She spells out what happened upon her 
return. Hoping to nurture herself, two young sons, and her flagging career, she 
repressed painful memories of fierce sibling rivalries, of the family's 
patrician manners that concealed their inability to communicate, and of the 
absence of intimacy with her parents that used to fill her with frustration 
when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
During the preceding decade, while Sallie had lived in Manhattan, she'd been on 
the board that governed the family's communications empire. Frightened at the 
thought of serious involvement in the family business, she'd persuaded her 
husband to serve in her stead, confining her interest to the regular dividend 
checks that subsidized their life style. When she returned to Louisville, a 
single woman, she started taking her directorship seriously, becoming 
increasingly vocal about company policies. Her challenges stirred the other 
Bingham women directors to start raising questions, timidly at first. 
</P>
<P>
Sallie describes how participation by shareholders, particularly female 
shareholders, was resisted by her brother, Barry Bingham Jr., who had been 
editor and publisher of the Pulitzer prize-winning paper since 1971. Giving her 
account of a luncheon she and her sister Eleanor had with three of Barry's 
managers, Sallie says, "We were told . . . we were talking too much at board 
meetings. The warning was crisp and clear. Shut up, or face terrible, although 
undescribed, consequences." Finally, Barry Jr., implacable in his opposition to 
interference by Bingham women, issued an ultimatum: His mother, his wife and 
his sister would leave the board, or he would resign as publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Sallie, alone, balked. She recounts that when her father passed the word that 
Barry might kill himself if she persisted, she dug in her heels. In March, 
1984, she was voted off the board by the family. Sallie retaliated swiftly. She 
shocked Louisville and the journalistic community by putting her 15% share of 
the business on the auction block, a move that within two years resulted in the 
$434-million sale of all the Bingham holdings. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bitter end to the 70-year family ownership of a newspaper that had 
been the pride of the South. And it was the virtual destruction of a 
distinguished but fatally flawed family. 
</P>
<P>
"Later, many people would ask me why the family never 'talked,' why the 
disaster -- as some saw it -- of the sale of the companies was allowed to 
happen without an attempt to untangle personal motives . . . . The lack of any 
real basis for communication in the family made such an informal 'get-together' 
unimaginable," Sallie remembers. 
</P>
<P>
Sallie's memoir, anxiously awaited by her relatives, is hardly likely to 
encourage family communication. More Freudian than Faulknerian in her approach, 
she drags us relentlessly through the family closet, where she picks up each 
skeleton, turns it this way and that, and leaves the reader with the 
suggestion, at least, that almost everyone except the author has been guilty of 
foul play. 
</P>
<P>
Her main quarry is her grandfather, Judge Robert Worth Bingham, whose first 
wife was supposed to have died in a car accident. Sallie suggests that her 
grandmother actually leaped to her death and that her father, Barry Sr., 
developed amnesia to avoid the reality. But, she cautions, "It is only 
speculation." The Judge subsequently married Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, the widow 
of an oil tycoon with a $100-million estate. The author hypothesizes, "Possibly 
all three were linked by syphilis, acquired by Flagler during the wild young 
days at Standard Oil . . . . Repeating a much ballyhooed story, Sallie reminds 
us that the Judge's second wife died in mysterious circumstances eight months 
after their wedding and after she bequeathed the judge the $5 million that 
became the seed money of the Bingham fortune. Dirty money, the heiress assures 
us. 
</P>
<P>
The author links her relatives to lesbianism, alcoholism, murder, insanity, and 
complicity with the CIA, basing her interpretations on material that is curious 
enough to warrant suspicions, but too meager for reasonable conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations are more florid than fair. Careful research and corroboration 
are rejected in favor of gossip and innuendo. Sallie Bingham, a Radcliffe magna 
cum laude and published author, knows better. The kindest interpretation is 
that in her exuberance to do in the family, she's willing to scuttle the basic 
principles of scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the points that the jittery author tries to make about modern society 
become obscured by her age. What a shame. This talented writer has a depth of 
experience she might have brought to the serious issue of prejudice and 
provincialism in the South. Real insight into her tragic family struggles could 
have helped the rest of us understand the potential destructiveness of 
inherited money, and the difficulties faced by third- and fourth-generation 
family-business owners. The one theme that does emerge intact is the struggle 
that women face in asserting themselves in male-dominated enterprises. Any 
woman who has ever prefaced her remark with, "I know this is a stupid question, 
but . . . " will find a kindred spirit in Sallie Bingham. 
</P>
<P>
This loveless book reads partly as an expiation, partly as an eruption of 
jealously linked to early frustrations with mother, and partly as a defiant 
self-vindication. Sallie's immediate relatives have banded together in an 
attempt to refute her account by sending major publications throughout the 
country, a detailed analysis of the memoir's factual inaccuracies. Apart from 
setting the record straight in the Kentucky archives, the Bingham counterattack 
wasn't really necessary. "Passion and Prejudice" stands alone as clear and 
convincing proof that facts are sometimes the enemy of truth. The nugget, here, 
lies not in the history of the author's family, but in the portrayal of her own 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
In her quest for self, Sallie poses two soul searching questions that are 
unlikely to endear her to a large audience: "How does a woman who inherits 
wealth and position justify herself?" And, "What is the role of glamour, magic, 
and excitement in privileged white upper-class life?" My guess is that the one 
most likely to rejoice in the publication of "Passion and Prejudice" -- which 
ought to be retitled "Sallie's Revenge" -- is the author herself, the 
powerless, female middle-child who is on top of her family at last. This time 
she's gotten their attention.
