BULLRING COLLAPSES; 7 DIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Seven people were killed and 307 were injured when a temporary bullring packed 
with more than 3,000 spectators collapsed in the Colombian town of Honda, 70 
miles west of Bogota, the capital, witnesses said. Ramiro Lozano, Red Cross 
director for Tolima province, said 30 of the injured were hospitalized in 
serious condition. A journalist from the RCN radio station who was reporting 
live on the bullfight Saturday said the structure, made of metal scaffolding 
and heavy wooden planks, collapsed in a matter of seconds. Witnesses claimed 
there were up to 3,500 spectators in the arena, which can normally accommodate 
2,500 people, and that the structure had been hastily set up. Authorities 
launched an investigation.

A new Sri Lankan group calling itself the "Black Cats" executed 20 Sinhalese in 
the first major violence since election results were announced last week, 
military officials said. The victims were members of the People's Liberation 
Front, an ultranationalist Sinhalese militant group that opposes the 
Sinhalese-dominated government's attempts to grant limited autonomy to minority 
Tamils. At least 1,000 people, including 14 candidates for the legislature, 
were killed during the five-week election campaign that ended Wednesday. Most 
of the deaths were blamed on the People's Liberation Front.

Colombia's leftist Patriotic Union party, in what was seen as a significant 
policy change, called on rebel groups to end guerrilla activities and make 
concrete peace proposals. The government insists that it will only open talks 
with the rebels once they prove they are serious about seeking peace, but the 
Patriotic Union and other opposition parties want talks without prior 
conditions. Party President Bernardo Jaramillo said: "The guerrillas must 
realize that it is not possible to achieve a military triumph in this country. 
The only solution to Colombia's violence is to negotiate away from arrogant 
positions and offer concessions."

Condoms at a pep rally scavenger hunt resulted in the suspension of eight 
members of the Sutter High School cheerleading squad in Marysville. The 
cheerleaders organized a scavenger hunt at a rally last week and used a list 
that included the item "protection." Two male students provided the condoms and 
turned them in with the other items. "We just don't think it's appropriate that 
they should be displayed in public in our campus," said Vice Principal Douglas 
Andreasen. "We feel it's a personal item that should be kept personal." The 
mothers of three of the cheerleaders tried to talk to school officials 
Thursday, but were told to make an appointment for a later date. Andreasen said 
the male students who provided the condoms were not punished.

Winter continued to pound much of the nation as an estimated 30,000 homes in 
the Carolinas and Virginia were without power for a second day after 14 inches 
of snow and ice fell in the region. Freezing drizzle fell during the night 
across much of central and western Kansas, southwest Nebraska and southeast 
Colorado. Roads were hazardous. About 75 families of the southeastern Missouri 
community of East Prairie remained displaced after flooding from 11 inches of 
rain last week. Up to five inches of snow fell across Yellowstone National Park 
and light snow extended from the central Rockies westward. In Cleburne, Tex., 
workers drained 20,000 gallons of a toxic chemical from a tank car that tumbled 
into a creek in a rain-caused train derailment.

Saying it is time for the newcomers to fend for themselves, city officials in 
Miami are dismantling a controversial special relief program for Nicaraguan 
immigrants. "You have to kick them out of the nest," said Martha Torres, a 
volunteer official. The assistance had drawn criticism from black leaders in 
the wake of last month's disturbances in Miami's black neighborhoods. They 
claimed Latino immigrants were granted special privileges while blacks were 
relatively ignored. The city had assembled two shelters to handle the more than 
300 aliens who were living in a baseball stadium. They were later placed in 
apartments. Critics of the city's recent decisions say the Nicaraguans are 
unlikely to be able to become self-sufficient because most will not have work 
permits while immigration officials decide whether they will be permitted to 
stay.

About 100 people gathered outside St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic 
Church in Bridgeport, Conn., kneeling, singing and praying before the locked 
doors of the building that protesters had occupied for nearly a week. Diocese 
leaders closed the predominantly Polish church until further notice Saturday 
after police removed dissident parishioners who had occupied the church to 
protest the transfers of a popular pastor and an assistant priest and to demand 
that the current pastor leave. "The doors are locked, but we want to show the 
world we won't quit," said Halina Chmiel of Milford, one of the leaders of the 
protest.

Sheriff's detectives sought gunmen who fired several shotgun blasts into the 
Sacramento-area home of a black family after painting the house with the 
letters "KKK." Sgt. Paul Hauptman said no one was hurt in the incident in the 
south Sacramento suburb of Florin. "We just went through a living nightmare and 
we just don't understand why," homeowner Othella Jenkins said, adding that she 
had never experienced any problems in the neighborhood where she has lived

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE RIFT;

<P>
HIGH-TECH HERESY AT THE MONITOR?

<P>
Newspapers by nature are the kind of thing people take personally. Just ask any 
editor about the irate phone calls that pour in after each decision to drop a 
comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
Now imagine if someone makes sweeping changes in a newspaper that is literally 
a religious mission, changes that provoke a debate about the very foundation of 
the religion. 
</P>
<P>
That, in short, explains how events at the Christian Science Monitor have 
become the vortex of a crisis of faith at the First Church of Christ, 
Scientist, the small, 110-year-old religious sect based in Boston and known 
largely for embracing spiritual healing and for publishing its venerable 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Full-Color Version 
</P>
<P>
In November, the three top editors of the Monitor resigned, charging that the 
church's expansion into television and radio broadcasting was threatening the 
future of the 80-year-old journal. Last month, the church introduced a much 
smaller, full-color Monitor in a year when it was spending at least $65 million 
on radio, television and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But confidential church documents, videotapes, financial data and interviews 
reveal that the story goes far deeper. Some members of the church are 
convinced, based on these documents, that the church management secretly 
planned to eliminate the deficit-ridden newspaper in favor of building an 
electronic media empire that would attract new members. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials say such charges misstate their intentions. And they have 
lashed out against the critics, accusing one of undermining "the efforts of 
present management to achieve a profit through greater efficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Yet some church members worry that, even if it is moving in the right 
direction, the leadership is endangering the church's future financially by its 
attempts to rapidly build a full-spectrum media empire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Troubling Question 
</P>
<P>
And at its heart, the debate involves a more troubling question that transcends 
Christian Science: Is the quality of ideas and discourse being fundamentally 
debased in a world dominated by television? 
</P>
<P>
As renowned church scholar Robert Peel put it last year in a book: "Will 
Christian Scientists put their whole heart and soul into strengthening the 
church's healing mission through deeper individual spirituality and commitment? 
Or will the organization pour its faith, funds and energy into extending 
electronically a watered-down version of the original message?" 
</P>
<P>
Launched by church founder Mary Baker Eddy in 1908, the Monitor has always been 
a curious mix of journalism, religion and business. Through quality news 
gathering, it was supposed to fulfill the church mission of helping society and 
of keeping the flock from becoming too insular, its profits to accrue to the 
church. Today, the debate over the Monitor is largely one about which of these 
three values should predominate. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the Monitor's reputation swelled; it regularly made lists of 
the country's 10 best newspapers, admired for its determinedly objective 
reporting and broad coverage of national and international developments. In so 
doing, it also helped become a source of pride that kept the tiny sect from 
being dismissed as a cult. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1961, it even turned a profit. Then, as national advertising drifted to 
television, the Monitor's losses built up, totaling $166 million between 1970 
and 1987, according to confidential church documents provided to The Times by 
numerous sources. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials did not quarrel with published reports that church 
membership was dwindling, the number of churches dropping by nearly 20% in two 
decades. Though the church no longer releases figures, membership was 269,000 
in 1936 and is thought to be lower now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worldwide Video 
</P>
<P>
To rejuvenate the church, its governing board of directors in 1984 conducted a 
worldwide video conference called "To Live for All Mankind," in which it called 
on members to focus less on individual and church problems and more on those of 
the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
To rejuvenate the paper, the church in the early 1980s hired as manager John H. 
Hoagland Jr., a business consultant and church member, and as editor Katherine 
Fanning, one of the most prominent Christian Science journalists in the 
country. And the paper improved, in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
But by 1985, the Monitor was still losing $16 million a year, its circulation 
mired near 150,000, down from a high of 170,000 in the 1950s, and Hoagland 
decided that the paper could not be made profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agreed that changes were needed. The question was how to make them. 
</P>
<P>
Hoagland, with the backing of Harvey Wood, the senior member of the board of 
directors, increasingly began talking about the Monitor as a "concept" or "a 
complete system" of communication rather than simply as the newspaper Eddy had 
founded. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be foolish to argue that TV is not the medium on which most people 
depend," Hoagland said in an interview. To stay "abreast of the times," he 
said, echoing the church's governing manual, the church needed to understand 
how modern communication worked. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, people now get news from radio, a visual and emotional sense of the 
world from TV and a sense of how to interpret events from print, Hoagland said. 
</P>
<P>
In private sessions with church leaders, Hoagland argued that the church's 
publishing society, which also produces its religious literature, could turn a 
profit and reach a wider audience through radio and television. The church 
elders were persuaded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekend Show 
</P>
<P>
They began a weekend radio news show in 1984 on public radio, which went 
nightly in 1985. They started a monthly TV news program in 1985, and in 1986 
bought television Channel 68 in Boston, on which eventually they would spend an 
estimated $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
And the move toward electronic news gathering was mirrored by changes on the 
religious side. The same year they bought Channel 68, church directors 
conducted another worldwide video conference, this one called "Global Lecture 
Preparatory Meeting." In it, elder Wood argued that members had "been speaking 
largely to themselves . . . in formats that were outdated." 
</P>
<P>
The acquisitions and the rhetoric were spawning a debate inside the church: 
Could television carry on the church mission of quality journalism? 
</P>
<P>
"The obverse weakness of a medium (television) that inherently treats the 
evidence of the eyes as decisive reality . . . is that it tends to be facile 
and superficial and to sacrifice . . . the very qualities that have given 
Monitor journalism its reputation," Bonn correspondent Elizabeth Pond would 
write three years later, when she resigned from the paper. 
</P>
<P>
While the argument continued, the strategy accelerated. The church launched a 
shortwave radio service in 1987, airing news and religious broadcasts overseas. 
It will cost $11 million to run this year, excluding $20 million in 
construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the church added a slick monthly magazine and what Hoagland in 
confidential church documents has described as a crucial element, a nightly TV 
news program, "World Monitor," hosted by former network correspondent John 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Affluent Readers 
</P>
<P>
The program, which airs nightly on cable's Discovery Channel, resembles ABC's 
"Nightline" -- mixing taped reports and conversations with experts -- but 
touches on more than one subject, usually international affairs, each night. It 
will cost at least $20 million to produce each year, church officials said, not 
including acquiring equipment and building facilities, and so far has a limited 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly World Monitor magazine, meanwhile, is aimed at younger and more 
affluent readers than the five-day-a-week Monitor newspaper, according to 
editor Earl Foell, and will make heavy use of expert authors rather than simply 
journalists. It will cost $7 million to operate next year. 
</P>
<P>
The figures have alarmed some church members. A "dizzying rush into electronic 
media," Monitor Washington Bureau Chief Charlotte Saikowski called it upon 
resigning. And frankly, some wonder if the expansion is so rapid and expensive 
that the church is risking financial ruin. 
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year alone, the magazine, shortwave and TV ventures will 
cost the church between $65 million and $75 million. To pay for it, the church 
over the last three years will have liquidated nearly two-thirds of its 
unrestricted pool of funds, from $167 million to about $60 million by next May. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo, federal judge and prominent church member Thomas Griesa wrote that 
"the church's financial condition (now) is extremely difficult" and "this 
situation is caused by expanding much too fast into a number of very 
speculative endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
Church Treasurer Donald C. Bowersock adamantly disagrees. He said that Griesa 
and others forget that $20 million to $25 million of this year's broadcasting 
expenses are capital investments, which won't be needed again. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the seeming speed of the expansion has left some wondering whether the 
church officials were hoping that the media strategy would divert attention 
from the church's internal problems and perhaps woo new members -- as if "they 
see TV as a magical tool that can renew the church," as one young former 
Monitor reporter and church member put it, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, said John Selover, chairman of the church directors. "The survival of 
the church is far more attuned to how much good it can do than to how many 
members there are." 
</P>
<P>
Nor by Selover's reckoning, are the moves high risk. "I don't want to be blue 
sky, but . . . to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves, those words have 
motivated this whole thing and they have never been bankrupt and never would," 
he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspicion, Intrigue 
</P>
<P>
But as time progressed, suspicion and intrigue at church headquarters clouded 
the philosophical and financial arguments, and eventually two camps emerged. 
And at the center of it was the belief by one that management wanted to kill 
off the money-losing Monitor -- an act church management in interviews called 
"unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
Critics turn to internal documents to support their argument that management 
wanted to shut down the paper. In a confidential five-year plan in 1985, for 
instance, Hoagland outlined five "probable scenarios" for the future of the 
church's media, three of which involved eliminating the Monitor. One option -- 
a weekly paper and various broadcasting efforts -- "may well be the best 
overall plan," the document reads. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, church management prepared a letter for members announcing that 
the publishing society would introduce a weekly paper into the United States 
and dramatically raise the price of the daily, from $140 a year to about $200. 
</P>
<P>
To editor Fanning and others, the letter was a further step in a plan to kill 
the Monitor. Not only did they believe that the weekly and daily would weaken 
each other by competing in the same market, but they had never been informed 
that management had indeed considered this course. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning and Managing Editor David Anable threatened to resign unless management 
made some commitment to the daily paper in the letter and described plans for 
the weekly as tentative, according to Anable. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was changed, but the flame of distrust was not extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, Hoagland conducted an all-day meeting on the future of church 
media with the publishing society board of trustees, which runs the church 
media under the auspices of the church's overall board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning and her deputies were not included, in fact not even formally notified 
that the meeting had taken place until two months later, after the board of 
trustees and board of directors had formally approved its findings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Financial Promise 
</P>
<P>
According to a videotape of that session and more than 100 pages of documents 
obtained by The Times, Hoagland saw great financial promise in broadcasting, 
none in the daily newspaper. He also presented two budgets -- a traditional one 
with all media continuing, and an "alternate" in which only shortwave and a 
proposed daily TV news program remained. Gone were all other news efforts, 
including the Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
"We would recommend the alternate that we've shown here," Hoagland says on the 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Many who have seen the tape view it as further proof that management wanted to 
kill the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Bowersock, then chairman of the trustees, said that the presentation 
was designed "to get the board's attention," rather than as a literal 
recommendation. "He was running it up the flag pole to see what would happen," 
and people said no. 
</P>
<P>
Hoagland and other board members also insist that they never planned to kill 
the Monitor, which Hoagland contended "will be here forever." But "to deny the 
ability of management to say those issues and to say them out loud would be to 
deny management its integrity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed, while the trustees and later the directors endorsed Hoagland's 
"direction and emphasis," according to church documents, the alternate plan has 
not been followed. 
</P>
<P>
But sometime in the fall of 1987, Fanning told managing editor Anable and 
others that Hoagland had informed her the Monitor would shut down for good in 
the spring of 1989. Hoagland flatly denies that. Fanning, traveling in Asia, 
could not be reached for this article. 
</P>
<P>
Fanning spent most of 1988 heading a task force to redesign the Monitor and cut 
the paper's annual deficit to about $10 million. She presented her findings in 
October, but the board rejected them, choosing instead a plan by Richard A. 
Nenneman, a member of Hoagland's management team. That plan proposed changing 
the Monitor even more radically, eliminating advertising, cutting staff 
substantially and reducing the number of pages from an average of 32 per issue 
to 16. 
</P>
<P>
But according to church documents, long before either prototype could be begun, 
the board had set on a course that it knew would force Fanning out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Staff Reorganization 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Hoagland had recommended a staff reorganization, in which the Monitor 
would share its news bureaus with the church's TV and radio divisions. A new 
editor in chief, ranking above Fanning, would coordinate the effort. According 
to Wood, the senior director of the church, the board knew that Fanning 
disliked the plan. She argued that the Monitor should take precedence over the 
more speculative TV and radio ventures. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the moment we made that decision for that organizational change, Kay 
would not stay," Wood told the paper's Washington bureau after Fanning 
resigned, according to a transcript of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
What the board did not expect was that managing editor Anable, his deputy, 
David Winder, and many of the Monitor's best known and most talented staff 
members also would resign. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the crisis, the church made rapid changes in the new Monitor from 
Nenneman's prototype. It went back up to 20 pages and included two pages of 
advertising. And, most significantly, the paper added full color. 
</P>
<P>
But the move to color forced another change that drove even more people to 
resign and has drastically altered the character of the newspaper. To print and 
distribute the paper on time, most stories in the Monitor now must be completed 
and edited two days before most readers will read the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"The Monitor has lost its purpose, identity and direction," one editor said in 
his resignation letter. One joke now calls the paper "USA Yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
Nenneman and Hoagland, however, argue that their reader surveys show that 
people no longer read the Monitor for breaking news but for interpretation of 
longer term international and national events. In effect, they argue, the paper 
is streamlining to focus on its strengths. 
</P>
<P>
But even some at the Monitor who believe Nenneman and Hoagland said privately 
that they fear that, once reporters are removed from gathering news, their 
ability to analyze and interpret it is greatly diminished. 
</P>
<P>
And the critics also wonder whether the Monitor can maintain its quality with a 
staff drastically cut back, from 170 to about 110, with some of those remaining 
now sharing their responsibilities with radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it may come down to what extent the Monitor is viewed as a business 
and not simply as a mission. 
</P>
<P>
"The logic of Christian Science demands that an ailing church be treated as an 
ailing patient would be -- with total commitment to spiritual ways and means, 
not human skills and repairs," wrote scholar Peel. 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor is a mission and a business both, argues management. As Hoagland 
once put it to church officials in a report, "A sense of order and of integrity 
(is derived) . . . through its requirement to be a business enterprise."

NEW ACTIVISM STIRRING IN GOP, DEMOCRATIC PARTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
A week and a world apart, California's Democratic and Republican parties 
convened here this month and peered around the corner at a turning point in 
their history. 
</P>
<P>
What greeted them in their back-to-back conventions were the stirrings of new 
political activism for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans saw it in a demonstration of abruptly changing visions. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who is leaving the office in 1990, gave his party the 
same kind of speech that has been the trademark of much of his Administration: 
a detailed blast at crime that overpowered his bare mention of education, 
transportation and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tough-on-crime policies have been highly successful in putting lawbreakers 
behind bars," he told conventioneers Sunday morning. "Because of tougher laws 
and tougher judges, the number of inmates in our state prisons has more than 
doubled since we took office." 
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans here were clearly restless with this theme, however, as 
evidenced by their restrained applause for the governor's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Just the night before, by contrast, their enthusiasm flowed freely when U.S. 
Sen. Pete Wilson announced that he would run for governor next year and 
outlined an agenda that emphasized quality-of-life concerns. 
</P>
<P>
He declared there was no saying "no" to tackling transportation, health care, 
AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, child care, school dropouts, clean air and water and 
more. He used words like "innovative" and "aggressive" and said the GOP must 
now stand as the party that believes "environmental health and economic health 
are mutually dependent, not mutually exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who missed the sharp transition in tone from the outgoing governor 
to the incoming GOP gubernatorial front-runner, Wilson's handlers were on hand 
to help. 
</P>
<P>
"It was amazing, wasn't it?" said one inner-circle Wilson booster at the 
convention's end. "Pete's challenge is going to be to avoid the memory of this 
one-note crime stuff and present himself as a tough but compassionate 
quality-of-life champion." 
</P>
<P>
For Democrats, whose convention occurred the previous weekend in the same civic 
hall, the new promise of activism was visible everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Republicans turned to Wilson for strength in the 1990 campaign, the 
Democrats went back to former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. for his 
excitement and his pledge to capture the imagination of Californians who have 
dropped out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the job of a political party to mobilize the millions and millions of 
non-voters, and that's what I intend to do," said Brown on the occasion of his 
election as chairman of the California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
As the stars of the two conventions, Wilson and Brown found themselves 
competing as in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1982, Brown was trying to save his national political career and Wilson 
was trying to launch his in their race for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson won. Now, Brown is trying to emerge again, and Wilson hopes to become 
the most dominant politician in the state since Ronald Reagan by winning the 
governorship and appointing his successor to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he will run for no public office during 1990 or 1992, but even so, 
he managed -- at least at the convention -- to dwarf the Democratic Party's 
field of gubernatorial hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
Those hopefuls were in step with Brown, however, in their vision of an activist 
era. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we reaffirm our belief that California is ready to move again," said 
candidate for governor and Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp. His speech to the 
Democrats was sprinkled with words like "restore" and "revive" and "recapture" 
and "reclaim." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Starting to Revolt' 
</P>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis, an exploratory candidate for governor, put it this 
way to the Democrats: "Without leadership in Sacramento, it's no wonder we had 
50 measures on the ballot. People are starting to revolt against that kind of 
stand-still politics." 
</P>
<P>
At this stage, 21 months from the election, both parties are still obviously 
struggling with their lineups for the 1990 statewide races. 
</P>
<P>
For the Republicans, Wilson's decision to run for governor after just being 
reelected to the Senate last November has dramatically narrowed the field in 
that race. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates wants to stay in as a law-and-order 
candidate, but GOP glamour contender Peter V. Ueberroth sent a strong signal 
over the weekend that he was losing interest. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what he would do when he retires as commissioner of baseball March 
31, Ueberroth told a New York Times sports columnist: "Straight answer? I don't 
know. I won't start looking until I finish this job. I hope to stay in New York 
and make a living." 
</P>
<P>
Before Wilson jumped into the race, Ueberroth said he would return to Southern 
California and might be interested in running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
The lesser offices of lieutenant governor, attorney general and others have 
been a problem for the Republicans in past elections. Often they have fielded 
incomplete or weak slates. But party leaders vow to do better in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) was among the first to obtain an audience 
with Wilson at the convention to discuss the remainder of the ticket. Seymour 
emerged and said he was "very seriously looking at the lieutenant 
governorship." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Campbell (R- Hacienda Heights) said he was weighing his prospects 
for the same office. 
</P>
<P>
More than a half a dozen other officeholders were openly campaigning for 
consideration for a spot somewhere in the GOP statewide slate. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, because of intense early competition at the top of the ticket and 
Brown's dominant profile, spent much of their convention talking about how to 
win the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Van de Kamp and Davis, the party has potential candidates in former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, the man Wilson 
beat last year in the Senate election. 
</P>
<P>
For lesser offices, Secretary of State March Fong Eu has indicated her desire 
to stay in place, and Brown's sister, Kathleen, is well along in a campaign to 
challenge Republican state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
The extra interest in this year's conventions reflects significant changes in 
law and in political trends. These potentially increase the importance of party 
organizations, which have been sideline players for most of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Voter-approved political reforms now limit candidate fund-raising, so parties 
will be called on for help by office seekers. At the same time, organizers of 
both parties say that the ground game of California politics -- voter 
registration and get-out-the vote drives -- is becoming increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
Some things, however, are unchanging about California's two parties. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats stayed at the union-organized Holiday Inn. Many delegates arrived 
from around the state by bus. Their schedule kept them at the convention hall 
from early morning until late at night. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans crossed union pickets to stay at the non-union Hyatt Capitol 
Park. Most long-distance delegates came by airplane, and the convention program 
lasted barely longer than the raucous hospitality suite receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Republican political consultants and staffers proudly wore their gold Rolex 
wristwatches. Jerry Brown, though, left his at home and wore an inexpensive 
black digital.

DESPITE RULES, LEAD POISON STILL A THREAT TO WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Labor Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Oct. 4, Jesus Mendez, was so ill that he had to stop working at a San 
Diego radiator repair shop. He had been sick off and on for four years but he 
did not know why, despite being treated by several doctors. 
</P>
<P>
After a social worker suggested that his poor health might be work-related, a 
lawyer sent him for a blood test. It turned out that Mendez had become a victim 
of an ailment known since before the birth of Christ -- lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Four months after he stopped working, Mendez still has unsafe levels of lead in 
his blood. There is no telling when he will be able to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez, 36, said he is depressed and constantly aware of his lead poisoning. 
"Every morning when I get up I have the taste of lead in my mouth," he said in 
an interview. "By the time morning is through it feels as if my head is going 
to explode." 
</P>
<P>
Mendez's situation is all too common. More than a decade after the federal 
government enacted regulations restricting workers' exposure to lead, 
significant numbers of employees continue to be afflicted with lead poisoning, 
creating serious short-term and long-term health problems, according to recent 
studies obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 9,000 reports of high blood lead levels have been received by the 
California Department of Health Services in the past two years," said Dr. Linda 
Rudolph, director of the department's occupational health surveillance and 
evaluation program, who just completed one study. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said that more than 90% of the reports involved workers "employed in 
hazardous industries with well-known lead exposures." These work sites included 
battery manufacturing plants, lead smelters, brass foundries, gun firing 
ranges, radiator repair shops and construction, according to reports provided 
to the health department by medical laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
"Many reports identified workers who were seriously ill or had been 
hospitalized for treatment of lead poisoning," Rudolph said. She said 800 
workers had enough lead in their blood that serious health problems could 
result. There were multiple reports on many workers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lead poisoning can cause kidney damage, injury to the central and peripheral 
nervous system and even brain damage in particularly aggravated cases. Lead 
exposure before or during pregnancy may increase the chance of miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said that 46% of the affected workers in the California study were 
Latino and that 78% of those afflicted were in Los Angeles County. The study, 
she said, represents "just the tip of the iceberg" because many workers are not 
tested as is required in some situations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Factors 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of another study done by Rudolph and other doctors showed 
that only 2.6% of California facilities using lead had done environmental 
monitoring (air testing) and only 1.4% had routine blood testing of workers. 
This means that nearly 205,000 California workers with potential lead exposure 
toiled in facilities where no air testing of lead levels has been done, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
John Froines, who recently headed a study at UCLA that reviewed 14,000 air 
samples taken by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 
inspectors from 1979 to 1985, said the problems described by Rudolph are not 
limited to California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an epidemic of lead poisoning going on in the United States," 
said Froines, associate professor of industrial hygiene and toxicology at UCLA. 
He said he reached this conclusion based on the UCLA research, the California 
study and one recently done in New York state. There is no central repository 
of data on the number of workers nationally afflicted with lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been some improvements in the level of exposure in certain 
important industries, but the scope and severity of lead exposure is greater 
than OSHA envisaged when the lead standard was promulgated in 1978," said 
Froines, who wrote the federal lead standard at OSHA during Jimmy Carter's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Froines said the problem is particularly disturbing because the dangers of lead 
exposures have been known for so long. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we're seeing with lead is a microcosm of what's happening with 
occupational health," Rudolph said. "Despite some progress, we're seeing large 
segments of the worker community not benefiting from the work that has been 
done in the last couple of decades. Lead poisoning is preventable," she said. 
In fact, she added, the U.S. Public Health Service "has set a goal of 
completely ending occupational lead poisoning by 1990. We are a long way from 
reaching that goal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cleanup Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Senate 
Toxics and Public Safety Management Committee, introduced legislation designed 
to eliminate occupational lead poisoning in California by 1991. The bill would 
require the Department of Health Services, by July 1, 1990, to establish and 
maintain an occupational lead poisoning prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government took a major initiative in 1978 when OSHA announced 
broad new rules to protect workers from lead poisoning. At the time, the agency 
said nearly a million American workers were exposed to excessive lead levels on 
the job and that about 100,000 of them were suffering from some illness 
directly attributable to those exposures. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules required companies, over a one- to 10-year period, to reduce 
permissible exposure levels from 200 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air 
to 50 micrograms. The OSHA lead standard also requires blood testing of 
employees working in an area where air samples show 30 or more micrograms of 
lead per cubic meter of air. 
</P>
<P>
If any test reveals the presence of 60 micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood or three consecutive tests show an average of 50 micrograms, a worker 
must be removed from the job. The worker can return to the job only if two 
consecutive tests show that the level is under 40. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual provision of the standard protects a worker removed from his job 
because of a high lead level against loss of pay, seniority or other job 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Putnam, a consultant to the Lead Industries Assn., said most companies 
had come into compliance with federal standards. He said that if there were 
problems they generally would be found at small companies. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Philip Landrigan, an occupational medicine specialist at Mt. Sinai School 
of Medicine in New York, said there has been significant reduction in lead 
exposures in some industries -- particularly battery manufacturing. However, 
Landrigan and others said that workers in some industries -- particularly brass 
foundries, radiator repair and construction, the latter of which is 
specifically exempted from the OSHA standard -- are exposed to dangerous levels 
of lead. 
</P>
<P>
Landrigan also said recent research showed workers could be endangered by 
amounts of lead in the blood smaller than had been believed in 1978 when the 
OSHA standard was enacted. He said three scientific studies showed that a 
significant number of children born to women who had 20 micrograms or more of 
lead in their blood while pregnant had a negative effect on the children's 
intelligence. "Twenty micrograms is well below" the current standard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, OSHA has issued a number of citations against companies 
violating the lead standard, agency officials said. For example, last October, 
OSHA fined Federated Metals of Paramount $202,900 for repeatedly exposing 
workers to dangerously high levels of lead. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Frank Strasheim, OSHA's regional administrator in San Francisco, 
said the Federated case was part of a disturbing, wider pattern of lead 
problems in California. "I'm surprised at the severity of the lead-exposure 
cases we are finding in California, especially in the long-established firms," 
Strasheim said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue of Inspectors 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph, Froines and other occupational safety experts asserted that OSHA had 
too few inspectors to be effective on lead problems. Dr. James G. Dahlgren, a 
Los Angeles physician who has treated many victims of lead poisoning, said the 
only hope for many workers was having an aggressive union health and safety 
representative monitoring conditions in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Dahlgren and Rudolph also noted that the federal lead standard does not apply 
to companies with fewer than 10 workers. Rudolph said many small companies are 
endangering workers, in some instances perhaps unknowingly. Many Los Angeles 
County companies told health department researchers that they were not aware of 
their obligations under the lead standard and fewer than 20% of 300 firms 
contacted had done any air monitoring, said Dr. Paul Papanek, chief of the Los 
Angeles County Health Department's toxics epidemiology program. 
</P>
<P>
Papanek recounted one "horror story" of a worker he had treated while in 
private practice with Dahlgren. The man had been heavily exposed to lead while 
working in a Los Angeles battery factory. On five occasions in 1982, the lead 
in his blood was double the allowable limit and he had to be hospitalized, 
Papanek said. The man should have been removed from his job by a company 
physician long before he was, Papanek said, because his overexposures had 
permanent consequences. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't remember his kids' birth dates," Papanek said of the man's condition 
today. "He has great trouble with memory. His wife won't let him drive. He's 
brain-damaged. He's not going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ira Monosson of Santa Monica, an occupational medicine specialist, said his 
patient Mendez is regrettably typical of the way workers develop serious lead 
problems. Mendez worked as a welder in his native Mexico from 1967 to 1978. In 
1979, he went to work at a small radiator repair shop in San Diego. According 
to his medical records and in an interview, Mendez said that he worked six days 
a week repairing radiators. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, he began to experience fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite and nausea 
and abdominal pains. He went to a doctor who diagnosed his problem as an ulcer. 
Over the next four years, his symptoms grew worse: the fatigue intensified, he 
was often irritable, experienced numbness and tingling in one arm, had severe 
headaches and trouble remembering things. Mendez saw several doctors but he was 
never tested for lead in his blood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really ridiculous," Monosson said. "Too many doctors don't know to ask 
people what they do for a living. Medical schools are terribly remiss," he 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used Lead in Work 
</P>
<P>
Mendez and his two co-workers typically repaired eight to 10 radiators a day, 
according to his medical records. He used lead and lead byproducts most of his 
day in soldering and welding. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez said that during his nine years at the radiator shop, he used a 
respirator mask for only 15 days in 1985. "It got dirty and the owner never 
replaced it," Mendez said. "So we didn't use them." 
</P>
<P>
Monosson said it may take a long time for Mendez's blood lead level to get down 
to normal because of the amount of the metal that accumulated in his body over 
many years of exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Mendez's lawyer, Mariaelena Davila, called his case "a terrible tragedy." She 
currently is involved in a battle over supplemental income benefits that his 
client is supposed to be receiving.

KHOMEINI RENEWS CALL FOR DEATH OF RUSHDIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, overruling his 
president and other Iranian moderates, declared Sunday that British author 
Salman Rushdie must be killed and sent "to hell" for writing "The Satanic 
Verses," a novel that many Muslims believe blasphemes Islam. 
</P>
<P>
In a harshly worded statement that seemed certain to set the stage for a major 
conflict with Britain and other Western nations, the 88-year-old Iranian 
patriarch rejected Rushdie's apology to Muslims on Saturday and said the 
Indian-born author could "never be forgiven" even if he repents. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time, it 
is incumbent upon every Muslim to employ everything he has, his life and 
wealth, to send him to hell," Khomeini said in a statement released by the 
official Iranian news agency IRNA. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian ruler also said that, while it is every Muslim's religious duty to 
try to kill Rushdie, Iran would also handsomely reward any non-Muslim assassin 
who got to the author first. 
</P>
<P>
Several Iranian clerics, responding to Khomeini's initial call last week for 
Rushdie's assassination, have already posted bounties of nearly $6 million on 
the 41-year-old author's head. 
</P>
<P>
"If a non-Muslim becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the ability to 
execute him faster than a Muslim, it is incumbent upon Muslims to pay a reward 
or a fee for this action," Khomeini said. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's uncompromising remarks seemed bound to further incite a passionate 
controversy raging throughout the Muslim world -- and, most significantly, even 
in Iran itself -- over Rushdie's critically acclaimed but heretofore obscure 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy also seemed certain to increase Iran's isolation, not only from 
the West but from the Arab world, where Islamic scholars -- while sharing 
Iran's indignation over the book -- have condemned its calls for the author's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Khomeini has the right to condemn the book, but not the man," a prominent 
Egyptian Islamic intellectual said, echoing a sentiment expressed throughout 
the Arab world, where the controversy over "The Satanic Verses" has generally 
been muted. 
</P>
<P>
Like a number of diplomats and other specialists who follow events in Iran, 
this scholar said that the controversy over the Rushdie book in Iran appears to 
be rooted more in politics than religion, reflecting an ongoing power struggle 
within the leadership over the course that the Iranian revolution -- emerging 
as the loser from a long and costly war with Iraq -- will take. 
</P>
<P>
This view was reinforced by a number of conflicting signals over the Rushdie 
affair emanating from Tehran over the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, only three days after Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death, Iranian 
President Ali Khamenei sought to defuse the crisis by suggesting that the 
author could be "pardoned" if he repented and publicly apologized for the book. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, Rushdie, who is under 24-hour police protection at a secret 
location in Britain, issued a statement through his London literary agent 
expressing "profound regret" for "the distress that publication (of his novel) 
has occasioned to sincere followers of Islam." 
</P>
<P>
IRNA, in a series of contradictory reactions that appeared to reflect political 
conflict in Iran, subsequently rejected Rushdie's apology, then accepted it and 
finally rejected it again. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, in another indication of the conflict being waged in Iran, two 
Tehran newspapers strongly criticized the clerics who have put a 
multimillion-dollar bounty on Rushdie's life. "To pay one man to kill another 
man is murder at a premium and not a religiously inspired act," the newspaper 
Ettelaat said. Alluding to the power struggle, the English-language Tehran 
Times added that those offering a reward for Rushdie's slaying "were demeaning 
their religion for the sake of domestic political opportunism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Radical Strategy Seen 
</P>
<P>
Within the context of this divisive debate, the fact that Rushdie's fate seems 
to have become suddenly entwined with that of the Iranian revolution has less 
to do with the religious controversy surrounding "The Satanic Verses" than with 
what Iran specialists view as an attempt by Iranian radicals to abort their 
country's gradual reopening to the West following last year's cease-fire with 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"What is taking place in Iran right now is a struggle between those who want to 
rebuild the state and those who want to remain revolutionaries," said Fahmy 
Hueidy, a prominent Egyptian writer on Islamic affairs and an Iran specialist 
who has just returned from a visit to Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard-liners, who have been forced to keep a low profile since the 
cease-fire with Iraq, have found in this (Rushdie controversy) a pretext for 
inciting the situation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
While the uproar over the Rushdie affair clearly poses a threat to efforts by 
Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and other leading moderates to normalize 
Iran's ties with Britain, France and other Western nations, President 
Khamenei's conciliatory remarks on Friday were seen by most observers as an 
indication that the pragmatists had more or less regained control of the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Khomeini's fiercely uncompromising statement appeared to deal a heavy 
blow to these expectations and cast new doubts on Iran's postwar course. 
</P>
<P>
While he avoided naming him by shifting the blame to the foreign press, 
Khomeini nevertheless appeared to sharply rebuke Khamenei's efforts to end the 
crisis by contradicting the president's offer of a pardon to Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'This Is Denied, 100%' 
</P>
<P>
"The imperialist foreign mass media are falsely alleging that officials of the 
Islamic Republic have said that, if the author of 'The Satanic Verses' repents, 
the execution order against him would be abolished. This is denied, 100%," 
Khomeini said. 
</P>
<P>
Britain has responded to the Iranian threats against Rushdie's life by freezing 
plans to increase the size of its embassy staff in Tehran. France indicated it 
would postpone plans to send an ambassador back to Iran and said it would 
consult with its European allies on a joint response to the threats against 
Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Sunday called the death 
threat against Rushdie "basically intolerable" behavior that will hamper Iran's 
"rejoining the community of civilized nations." Baker made his remarks during 
an interview on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" program. 
</P>
<P>
Less noted but no less significant has been the concern felt in the Arab world, 
where the controversy over Rushdie's book has been eclipsed by shock and anger, 
in both religious and secular circles, over the Iranian reaction to it. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, the Iranian threats have reopened Islam's centuries-old schism 
between the majority Sunni sect, which predominates throughout the Arab world, 
and the Shiite sect, which rules in Iran. Sunnis have always considered 
themselves to be more tolerant than the fundamentalist-oriented Shiites. 
</P>
<P>
However, this distinction, while real, is also simplistic. For, while many 
Sunnis seem to view the controversy as another example of Iranian Shiite 
extremism, the offense felt over Rushdie's book is by no means confined to 
Muslims of the Shiite sect. 
</P>
<P>
"I have read the book, and I can say that it is very offensive to every 
Muslim," said Ahmed Baha Eddin, one of Egypt's most respected newspaper 
columnists. 
</P>
<P>
Eddin, however, said he shares the indignation expressed Saturday by Egypt's 
Nobel laureate, Naguib Mahfouz, who called Khomeini's decision to urge that 
Rushdie be killed an act of "terrorism" against both "humanity and Islam 
because it harms the reputation of Islam and Muslims in the civilized world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giving Islam a Bad Name 
</P>
<P>
Concern that Iranian extremism is once again giving Islam a bad name was 
underscored by a number of Islamic scholars and other intellectuals who pointed 
out that, while violent demonstrations against Rushdie's book have taken place 
in Pakistan, India and Western Europe, there have been no similar disturbances 
in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Satanic Verses" is banned in many Arab countries, the notion that 
"one has a right to kill someone for what he has written strikes most Muslims 
as shocking and medieval," Eddin said. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government, meanwhile, ruling Sunday on a complaint from an 
unnamed Ottawa Muslim group, found that the book is not hate propaganda and 
lifted a temporary ban on its import, Reuters news service said.

SPANISH CAPE: CLASSIC CLOAK MAKING A COMEBACK -- LIKE COUNTRY ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

MADRID 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Spanish cape, that classic swirl of mystery and elegance, is making a 
modest comeback on the frosty streets of Madrid this winter as a cloak of many 
guises. 
</P>
<P>
The king of Spain has a cape, and so do a growing number of Eurocrats in 
Brussels. Picasso and Hemingway wore Spanish capes; Marcello Mastroianni and 
Catherine Deneuve still do. Capes are still rare in the swank precincts of 
Paris or Rome, but the sight of a caped Madrileno on an evening prowl is more 
arresting than unusual. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the cape is returning to fashion as an implicit assertion of 
nationality at the same time as it is flaring across national borders on a 
continent where Spain treads with a new step. 
</P>
<P>
These twin currents say as much about changing times in Europe today as they do 
about clothing styles. Spain, like Europe, is going two ways -- inward and 
outward -- at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
At Last, Some Movement 
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards are lately come to the councils -- and the spirit -- of Europe 
after four decades of isolation under Gen. Francisco Franco. Only in recent 
years have they joined the European Community and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, the landmark economic and security alliances that link West 
European democracies in unprecedented prosperity and unity. 
</P>
<P>
Historically more preoccupied with Latin America and North Africa than with 
Continental affairs, Spain now accepts its membership in Europe with a blend of 
exhilaration and trepidation. "Europe is one nation. Learn languages," urges a 
language school's advertisements on downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Spaniards measure their own achievements against the rest of Europe. 
Reporting that Europe is revising its traditional view of Spain's cultural 
level, the newsmagazine Cambio 16 recently noted with satisfaction, "After 
overcoming its isolation, present-day Spanish culture is awakening respect and 
great curiosity." 
</P>
<P>
Curiosity extends in all directions today in a prosperous West Europe where 
consumer goods routinely vault falling frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
The French, Spaniards and Italians have little interest in each others' wines, 
thank you, but they all understand that state-of-the-art whiskey and rain gear 
come from Britain. Italians are also lately come to British teas, while the 
British usually prefer anybody else's wine to their own. French roads are full 
of Italian Fiats; Italian TV airs slick ads for West German Volkswagens and 
French Renaults. 
</P>
<P>
Amid a trend toward European homogenization, home-grown national customs thrive 
nonetheless. West Germany is currently up in arms over a European Community 
decision to allow the import of foreign beers and sausages. Italy is appalled 
by Common Market regulations that permit the sale in Italy of the soft, gooey 
kind of pasta that Americans are weaned on but Italians won't eat. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Europe's national cults don't travel well -- village bocce, big-time 
bullfighting and high-tone fox hunting, to name a few. Others do. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the cape. Its origins are lost in time: a hybrid descendant of the Roman 
toga and the humble shepherd's blanket, perhaps. Its signature, though, is 
emphatically Spanish. The 3,000-member Friends of the Cape here says religious 
pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela in the 6th Century wore capes not very 
different in style from those made today. 
</P>
<P>
In the 17th Century, Spain's national chief of police tried to ban capes 
because they made it too easy to hide a weapon. The 19th Century, in contrast, 
is remembered by aficionados as the golden age of the cape. Yet even in the 
early days of this century, Spaniards -- urban and rural, of all social 
classes, men and women alike -- wore capes as shelter against rain and cold. 
Then began a long decline, until the cape survived principally as a set piece 
among soldiers, clerics, bullfighters and a hard core of purists for whom there 
is no substitute. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the cape is yesterday, today and tomorrow," said Alfonso Sanchez, the 
86-year-old president of Amigos de la Capa. "I have never known an overcoat. My 
memories are wrapped in my cape. I love its embrace -- almost feminine." 
</P>
<P>
Classically, a Spanish cape is cut in a full circle of tightly woven virgin 
wool from the mountain town of Bejar; the only variation in size is the length. 
A cape should end about three inches below the knees, according to Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
The man's cape, adorned at the collar with the hammered silver emblem of 
Salamanca, is usually black or navy blue with a short, stiff collar and inside 
front panels of red or burgundy velvet. The splash of color may be hidden or 
displayed, but the cape is never fastened. Women's capes, cut from a 
half-circle of the same wool, vary in style from year to year and may include a 
hood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Upswing 
</P>
<P>
Cape sales rise and fall according to fashion, but lately they have shown a 
strong upswing, according to Marison Nieto at Sesena, the shop in old Madrid -- 
the only one left -- that has been the arbiter of Spanish capes for nearly a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our new clients are Europeans who were exposed to capes for the first 
time by seeing Spaniards wear them at Brussels and other centers of the 
European movement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As the cape swirls out across the Pyrenees to a European audience, so, too, is 
it finding new favor among Spanish nationalists. Most of Madrid's habitual 
capistas are aging dons of law or the arts who, by custom, don their capes from 
November -- when the courts open -- until the almond trees blossom in early 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's cape heritage runs deep, though, and it is felt even among the overcoat 
crowd: a Spanish man is as likely to throw his overcoat, in cape fashion, over 
his shoulder as he is to put it on. 
</P>
<P>
Tellingly, there are also some unabashed new friends of the cape, and many of 
them are young Spaniards intrigued by a garment that is at once a piece of 
history and a distinctive national symbol in a Europe increasingly full of blue 
jeans. Both Sesena and the Amigos de la Capa are pleased by what they say is a 
marked increase in young Spanish capistas. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the other day, I had a call from some young people in La Coruna who want 
to become (members of) Friends of the Cape," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
The cape is also developing some improbable new friends among the 58 million 
international tourists who come to Spain each year. For a few, it has become 
only a memory of Iberia. 
</P>
<P>
"We must have gotten into a guide book somewhere, because suddenly the Japanese 
are turning up in large numbers. They are very quick to buy capes," Nieto said.

AFGHAN PRESIDENT TO FORM MILITARY COUNCIL TO COORDINATE BATTLE AGAINST 
GUERRILLAS

<P>
President Najibullah, seeking to tighten his grip on the government and 
military, will form and lead a supreme military council to coordinate the armed 
forces' fight against Muslim guerrillas, the Afghanistan's foreign minister 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came a day after Najibullah declared a nationwide state of 
emergency and replaced seven members of his Cabinet who were not members of his 
ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pakistan, guerrillas trying to form their own interim government 
failed to agree on a Cabinet list, and several delegates walked out of the 
governmental conference. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas also claimed to have captured a provincial capital in central 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said in an interview with British Broadcasting 
Corp. radio that the military council will coordinate economic and military 
activities and will be formed "in the next few days." He said the new council 
will not replace the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Wakil also said the emergency declared Saturday night is a precautionary 
measure and a "sign of strength, not weakness." New security measures will 
include house searches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said seven members of the ruling party's 
policy-making Central Committee are replacing the ousted non-party ministers. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give a sign to the counterrevolutionaries and show them the party 
is not finished," one senior party member said. "We are stronger than ever." 
</P>
<P>
There are still 10 non-party members in the Cabinet, including Premier Mohammed 
Hassan Sharq, his deputy and two vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
A diplomat said the reshuffling and emergency declaration were signs of a 
tightening of control by Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
"He has surrounded himself with his people. He's showing that he's now in 
charge; he's calling the shots now that the Soviets are gone," said the 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet army withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan last week 
under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord. They had been in Afghanistan since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-based guerrillas, who again nominated leaders of a government in 
exile in Pakistan on Saturday, have vowed to bring down Najibullah. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate guerrilla factions opposed to the nomination of hard-liner Ahmad Shah 
as prime minister walked out of the council session Sunday that was to approve 
the nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The council, or shura, was to reconvene today in Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, rebels said their forces captured Tarin Kot, provincial capital of 
the remote central province of Uruzgan, along with an unspecified number of 
government troops and a large quantity of arms and ammunition in a battle 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation of the report, which was carried by the 
rebels' Afghan News Agency based in Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
Tarin Kot is 60 miles from the nearest key highway and has little strategic 
importance. But its capture would bring to about half a dozen the number of 
provincial capitals to fall to the insurgents since Soviet forces began leaving 
Afghanistan in May. 
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas are said to control 90% of the countryside, but Najibullah's 
troops still hold most urban centers.

The government said it would free 30 detainees Sunday, most of whom had been 
held for security reasons or for belonging to banned political parties. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Rajai Dajani said they include leftists, radical Palestinians 
and Muslim militants. They are being freed under an amnesty granted by King 
Hussein to mark the formation of the Arab Cooperation Council linking Egypt, 
Iraq, Jordan and Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an undisclosed number of other prisoners, mainly suspects in 
robbery, fraud and other criminal cases, will also be freed shortly, the 
government said. Most of them had been held only briefly, a security official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein also ordered that convicts who had served half their sentences 
should be freed and the jail terms of others halved. The amnesty excluded those 
convicted of spying, rape, premeditated murder or treason.

PROSECUTION OF KIM KEUN TAE'S CASE MAY SIGNAL SEOUL'S HUMAN RIGHTS COURSE

Conversations with Kim Keun Tae lead invariably to the subject of torture. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, one of South Korea's most prominent dissidents, endured three weeks of 
beating, electric shock and water torture at the hands of the anti-Communist 
bureau of the national police in 1985, according to international human rights 
advocates and Kim's own account. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is a chance that his tormentors will be brought to justice -- if the 
government abides by a court order requiring a thorough investigation of the 
allegations. Authorities say they have interrogated four police suspects and 
begun a nationwide hunt for a fugitive police captain accused of directing 
Kim's chamber of horrors. 
</P>
<P>
The case has taken on symbolic importance ever since the country began its 
tumultuous journey toward democracy two years ago. In some ways, one man's 
defiance tells the story of an entire generation of political dissidents in 
South Korea. And how the case is resolved in the courts may provide a signpost 
for the course of human rights here. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in South Korea is improving, the U.S. State Department said in a 
report on human rights around the world, issued earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Major Cases 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of political prisoners remained high, "no major cases of 
torture or politically related killing came to light" in 1988, the report said. 
(Human rights advocates estimate that 270 "prisoners of conscience" remain in 
detention.) 
</P>
<P>
But in the recent past, allegations of police brutality and torture-induced 
confessions were frequent. The torture death of a student activist in January, 
1987, sparked massive anti-government protests. Kim warns of the lingering 
potential for renewed abuse, especially if the feared National Security Law, 
under which he was arrested for anti-state activities, remains on the books. 
</P>
<P>
President Roh Tae Woo's ruling Democratic Justice Party has said it is 
considering modifying the law and changing its name. In its current form, the 
law prohibits such acts as making statements that might be interpreted in such 
a way as to advance the cause of Communist North Korea -- one of the charges of 
which Kim was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"They can resume torture whenever they want," Kim said. "They want to keep the 
law for emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
Kim, 42, who, with his wife, activist In Jae Keun, shared the Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial human rights award for 1987, was released from prison under a 
political amnesty last June. He has since returned to the work that made him a 
government target. 
</P>
<P>
Kim began quietly organizing, helping to unite bickering dissident groups into 
a broad coalition dedicated to "mass struggle" -- dissident parlance for the 
kind of spontaneous street protests that hastened democratic reform and 
eventually drove former President Chun Doo Hwan into humiliating rural exile. 
</P>
<P>
Kim is a wild card on the South Korean political scene, which settled down only 
recently after two years of dramatic upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
"He played a pivotal role in bringing dissidents together," said Lee Hae Chan, 
an opposition lawmaker. "He has always set an example . . . a rational figure 
whose affection for his fellows has been deepened by his hardships." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recognize His Face 
</P>
<P>
Almost all South Koreans have heard of Kim Keun Tae and have learned to 
recognize his distinctively melancholy, oval-shaped face. But no one claims to 
know exactly who he is, what he stands for or how much power he may one day 
wield. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of him as a fighter for social justice," said Lim Kyung Moon, 26, a 
former riot police officer who recently returned to his studies in electrical 
engineering at Korea University. "He's one of our martyrs, but I don't know 
much about him." 
</P>
<P>
A similar opaqueness of purpose shrouds the dissident movement as a whole, 
which increasingly is adopting a tone of righteous anti-American scorn. Radical 
students and many older activists accuse the United States of propping up Chun 
and Roh in defiance of popular will. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, one of three leaders who last month formed the dissident coalition 
Chonminyon, or National People's Democratic Movement League, is evasive about 
his vision for political and social change in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Yet he insists that mainstream politicians -- even the opposition parties -- 
cannot be trusted with the task of steering the nation toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to set the course right," Kim said in a series of recent interviews. 
"The government only responds with democratic concessions when they face mass 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The situation is not expected to explode any time soon, though it could heat up 
later in the year, when students return to campuses and the National Assembly 
goes back into session. Kim's coalition is likely to face its first test of 
effectiveness during the spring labor offensive, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, calls are mounting for dissidents like Kim to drop their 
anti-establishment line and try working within the system. The polarization of 
society is destabilizing, some observers say. 
</P>
<P>
"They should seek ways to cooperate with democratic forces within the political 
establishment," said Lee Shin Bum, himself a former dissident who has joined 
the opposition Reunification Democratic Party. "It's wrong to dismiss 
established forces as strictly conservative." 
</P>
<P>
The government paints Kim as a seditious troublemaker, although it toned down 
its denunciations after an international campaign, spurred by the Kennedy 
award, sought his release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defection Report 
</P>
<P>
One ranking government official, who declined to be identified by name, 
described Kim as a hard-core Communist who advocates "proletarian revolution." 
He cited a police report that was circulated at the time of Kim's arrest in 
1985 that alleged that his three older brothers defected to the Communist north 
during the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kim would have been about 5 years old at the time, this family 
background somehow influenced his political outlook, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim tells a different story. Two of his brothers were killed and a third was 
reported missing and presumed dead in the Korean War. He remembers his brothers 
as "patriots," sympathetic with the resistance movement against Japanese 
colonizers during World War II and opposed to the division of the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
But he denies being a Communist or a supporter of North Korea. He dismisses the 
concept of a socialist class struggle as "befitting the teen-age, utopian 
dreams" of university students. 
</P>
<P>
"We activists in our middle age must be more responsible and work out a more 
practical answer," Kim said. "But to the government, anyone who advocates true 
democracy is a Communist. That's one of their tools of repression." 
</P>
<P>
Kim comes from a middle-class background. His father was vice principal of an 
elementary school in Suwon, a provincial capital south of Seoul. Kim turned to 
radical politics while majoring in economics at Seoul National University, 
South Korea's most prestigious educational institution, in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, Kim chose to forgo the rewards of his elite education; he 
went underground as a labor organizer. 
</P>
<P>
His quiet, methodical approach to building alliances in the youth and labor 
movements apparently threatened the government, which at the time adopted a 
policy of crushing labor activism. But it also earned him the grudging respect 
of some conservative analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not for the good, in my opinion, but his performance was brilliant when 
he was a student leader," said Rhee Sang Woo, a security specialist and dean of 
Sogang University's graduate school of public policy. "He is quite a man of 
integrity, and he demonstrated great skills in organizing people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, an aura of Confucian dignity emanates from the radical leader, who was 
chairman of the National Youth Alliance for Democracy at the time of his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Kim ceremoniously offered a bowl of persimmon punch to a visitor on a recent 
winter afternoon, saying political talk should come only after sharing this 
traditional drink of the lunar New Year. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting cross-legged on the floor of his modest flat in northeastern Seoul, Kim 
said he observed his first New Year's holiday out of prison in four years in 
the old Korean way. He had his two children, ages 7 and 10, kowtow respectfully 
before him, as is the custom; he in turn bowed toward the graves of his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kim's articulate account of his torture experience has given him a cachet of 
moral authority among activists. He has related his incredulity over how his 
torturers discussed, with compassion, their family affairs at the same time 
they attached electrical wires between his toes. Yet he is not happy with his 
martyr image. 
</P>
<P>
"Torture is something you can never build a resistance to," he said. "But I 
don't want to be made into a sentimental figure, or to be remembered only as a 
torture victim. I haven't overcome the experience, but I wasn't destroyed by 
it."

A hazardous materials spill forced the closure Sunday of the westbound lanes of 
Interstate 80 west of here, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
A California Highway Patrol dispatcher said solvent, battery acid and diesel 
fuel spilled on the highway after a truck rig overturned about 9:30 a.m. near 
Cisco Grove, 78 miles east of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
He said the van was "completely ripped open" and numerous boxes containing the 
solvent were on the side of the highway. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
A hazardous materials team was sent to the scene to remove the materials, but a 
dispatcher said the westbound lanes between Big Bend and Rainbow were expected 
to remain closed until after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
The closure created major traffic delays for westbound motorists and the CHP 
recommended U.S. 50 or California 70 as alternate routes across the Sierra 
Nevada.

OHIO RIVER BARGES SPILL GAS AFTER MISHAP; ENVIRONMENT PERIL STUDIED

Seven barges carrying gasoline broke free from a towboat Sunday on the Ohio 
River and spilled an estimated 40,000 gallons of fuel into the river after 
striking a railroad bridge piling, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had been diluted, said Rich 
Carter, assistant chief of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's Office of 
Emergency Response. 
</P>
<P>
"No impact has been observed thus far," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other downstream communities close enough to be affected draw their water from 
wells or underground aquifers, Carter said. The river's speedy flow makes the 
spill unlikely to affect water supplies or aquatic life much, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The rain-swollen Ohio River crested Saturday at 52.2 feet, inches above flood 
stage, and was falling Sunday. The spill posed the most immediate threat to the 
Louisville, Ky., water system about 100 miles downstream. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline tends to float on the water's surface, and authorities said water 
systems served by the river could close their intakes until the gasoline floats 
past. The spill occurred downstream from Cincinnati's intakes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The barges were being pushed down the river by the towboat MV Super America 
from an Ashland Oil Inc. refinery at Ashland, Ky., to an Ashland products 
terminal on the river in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the scene said several other towboats helped recapture the loose 
barges. Carter said two oil company facilities were draining the remaining 
gasoline from the leaking barges.

SENIOR FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER GEORGE VEST; 
</P>
<P>
DISCREET EXIT AFTER 41 YEARS AS DIPLOMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For America's senior diplomat, it was strictly deja vu. A new secretary of 
state -- this time, James A. Baker III -- was coming into office with his own 
set of top aides. And the advice of partisan supporters was ringing in their 
ears: "Don't let the Foreign Service take you over." 
</P>
<P>
As George Vest -- a 41-year veteran of the service -- lamented in a recent 
interview, the State Department's new management always takes the advice. 
Convinced that the career Foreign Service wants to pursue its own agenda 
regardless of the new President's foreign policy, the new bosses try to 
distance themselves from the diplomats who had served the previous 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Vest said, their resolve lasts only "until they run into problems. 
As challenges come up and they need the knowledge, it tends to break down the 
barriers. It is a natural evolution they have to go through." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Vest will not be around to see the drama play itself all the way 
out. At 70, he will step down soon from his post as director general of the 
Foreign Service. The exact date of his retirement has not been set because 
Baker has not yet named a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Vest's career has spanned virtually the entire era of post-World War II 
diplomacy. He joined the Foreign Service in 1947 as a consular employee in 
Bermuda, a holiday island but diplomatic backwater. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 41 years, Vest became a top expert on Europe, holding jobs that 
included chief U.S. representative at the conference that produced the historic 
Helsinki Accords on human rights in 1975 and assistant secretary of state for 
European policy. He also served a brief -- and, he admits, often unhappy -- 
stint as chief spokesman for Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around longer than all of the others," Vest said. "I don't know that 
antiquity is necessarily a virtue. But it is a distinction." 
</P>
<P>
In today's State Department, a 41-year career is nothing short of amazing. An 
increasingly stringent "up-or-out" policy is forcing most professional 
diplomats to the sidelines long before their 65th birthdays, often after 20 
years or less in the service. 
</P>
<P>
It seems certain that some of Vest's career Foreign Service colleagues, now in 
the top ranks of the State Department, will join him in retirement in the 
coming weeks because Baker will have no jobs for them in the new 
Administration. But, for the most part, they do not yet know who they are 
because the incoming secretary has been moving very slowly in filling the 
department's key jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Orderly Disorder' 
</P>
<P>
Vest described the transition to the Baker State Department as "orderly 
disorder." It is orderly, he said, because the new Administration is waiting 
until the Senate confirms an official before naming his subordinates. It is 
disorderly because it is slow and many important jobs have not yet been filled. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the ones of us that are going to be replaced are dedicated 
professionals," Vest said. "We are really foreign policy junkies. We want to 
see the job done well." 
</P>
<P>
For the last four years, Vest has held the State Department's top personnel 
post, handling the assignments for the nation's professional diplomats except 
for the handful who receive presidential appointments. It is a job that 
sometimes has tested the even temper and unflappable courtliness that have 
become his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
"I get every month something called the 'sin report' for the Foreign Service," 
he said. "I dole out the punishment. I had no idea of the endless variety of 
sin until I took this job." 
</P>
<P>
Very few of the violations of discipline, he said, involve hard drugs, even 
though there are many opportunities for diplomats to dabble in narcotics 
smuggling. Diplomats have access to the diplomatic pouch, which is not subject 
to customs inspection as it carries letters and goods across national borders, 
and they often serve in areas where drugs are readily available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lonely Life 
</P>
<P>
"Drugs have never been a problem in the Foreign Service, although liquor has 
been," Vest said. "We have had trouble with alcoholism. It can be a lonely 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course there are a lot of opportunities to drink at diplomatic functions," 
he said. "But the problem comes when they get home and are alone. The largest 
problem with alcoholism is with single people overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"We say to them that it is a disease and we don't hold it against them," he 
added. "We send them home without prejudice and send them to a place to work on 
the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at his own career, Vest said that his only truly bad assignment 
was his first one at the consulate in Bermuda, a self-governing British 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated the consul (his boss), and he deserved all my hatred," he said. "I was 
not a success." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the friction with his superior, Vest was given a second chance, at the 
U.S. Embassy in Ecuador. He fared better there, even though the ambassador -- 
after reviewing the personnel reports he had received in Bermuda -- told him: 
"You have the worst file of any junior officer I've ever known." 
</P>
<P>
After Ecuador, Vest was ticketed for the Dominican Republic. After he spent 
most of his savings on warm-weather clothing, he was transferred to Ottawa, the 
Canadian city that claims to be the second coldest capital in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with his wardrobe aside, the switch proved to be a fortunate one. The 
State Department, responding far more to history and culture than geography, 
includes Canada in its European bureau, and Vest's assignment there focused 
most of the rest of his career on Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his most satisfying assignment was chief of the U.S. delegation to 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki conference, 
which ratified the postwar boundaries of the continent and -- probably far more 
significantly -- established new standards for human rights in the Soviet Union 
and the rest of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we began something that is quite important, a way of legitimizing the 
aspirations of the people of Eastern Europe," he said. "It has become a beacon 
light to (Eastern European dissidents). They could believe they were not 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Helsinki conference may have loosened the Soviet grip on 
Eastern Europe in a way that John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower's hard-line secretary of state, had been unable to do with a 
diplomacy that he once described as "bringing the world to the brink of war." 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to put it in the terms that John Foster Dulles used," Vest said, 
"you could say we may be seeing a peaceful rollback of Soviet power."

BUSH CAPITAL GAINS TAX PLAN PERILED BY POLITICAL REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To President Bush, his proposal to cut the maximum tax on capital gains from 
33% to 15% would provide nothing more than a much-needed shot in the arm for 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"History is clear," Bush contended in his speech before Congress earlier this 
month. Reducing the tax on profits from longer-term investments, he said, "will 
increase revenues, help savings and create new jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the proposal's economic merits might be, however, the political 
reality is quite different. For lawmakers, the essential calculation about 
Bush's plan is that at least half of all the benefits would go to fewer than 1% 
of all taxpayers -- those with incomes above $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
As far as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is 
concerned, that alone should be enough to consign the proposal to the ash heap. 
"I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a 
higher tax than stockbrokers," says Rostenkowski, the top tax writer on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Equation Complex 
</P>
<P>
But for all Rostenkowski's clout in Congress, his opposition does not entirely 
close the door to a lower capital gains tax rate. As always in Washington, the 
hidden political equation is rarely as simple as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
Most Republicans support a change. Moreover, such Democrats as Rep. Beryl 
Anthony Jr. of Arkansas, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee and a member of the Ways and Means Committee, point out that many 
heavy Democratic campaign contributors also stand to gain from a lower capital 
gains tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should we do anything to (anger) the rich?" Anthony has asked colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many of the special-interest groups that favor a lower 
capital gains tax rate, having failed to protect it from the major tax overhaul 
of 1986, are working overtime to recover. Foremost among the lobbyists is 
former Treasury Department official Charls E. Walker, who represents some of 
the nation's largest industrial corporations and heads the American Council for 
Capital Formation. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you've got a President talking about this and Charlie Walker pushing 
it," says Joseph Minarik, staff director of the Joint Economic Committee, "I 
don't think you can count on its disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Bloomfield, executive director of Walker's council, considers Bush's 
decision to introduce the plan in Congress now, over the advice of political 
aides to wait at least a year, "an indication of how strongly Bush feels about 
this. I'm very encouraged that some sort of compromise will ultimately emerge." 
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that the current taxation of capital gains is deeply 
flawed. The large majority would adjust investment profits for inflation so 
that taxpayers are not forced to pay taxes on artificial profits that simply 
reflect general price increases. They also oppose the feature of the existing 
system that allows taxpayers to escape capital gains taxes at death and permits 
heirs to avoid any taxes on profits earned before their ownership. 
</P>
<P>
But politicians have never shown much interest in the economists' favorite 
reforms. They are worried about the complexity of inflation adjustments and a 
backlash from individual entrepreneurs and farmers if accumulated profits from 
their family businesses are taxed at death. 
</P>
<P>
The battle on Capitol Hill over capital gains promises to be a particularly 
long and nasty one. 
</P>
<P>
Any move to restore a lower tax rate for capital gains would drive a stake 
through the heart of the delicate 1986 compromise, in which lawmakers agreed to 
cut income tax rates across the board in return for eliminating many of the 
business and individual loopholes that previously undermined the fairness of 
the tax code and distorted investment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compare Savings 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all taxpayers with incomes over $200,000 would receive a tax cut from a 
lower capital gains rate. The average savings would be roughly $25,000 each 
from Bush's proposal, according to an estimate by Citizens for Tax Justice, a 
public lobbying group. That compares with minor or nonexistent savings for the 
vast majority of taxpayers with incomes under $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), who has 
supported a capital gains preference in the past, says that any effort to 
restore it would require balancing the cut with higher top-bracket rates on 
other income. 
</P>
<P>
But given Bush's objections to any changes that would raise taxes, many 
lawmakers are reluctant to start down that path at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, tampering with capital gains is playing with dynamite," says Rep. 
Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), a senior member of the Ways and Means 
Committee. "Anything we might do would open up the whole Pandora's Box just 
when we thought it was closed for a while. I'm hoping we don't have any tax 
bill this year so we don't have to worry about all the lobbyists descending on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal was cleverly designed to overcome several of the frequent 
objections to capital gains tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1986 overhaul of the tax code, capital gains have been taxed at the 
same rate as ordinary income. Bush proposed to change that as of July 1. 
</P>
<P>
For persons in the top 28% and 33% tax brackets, their capital gains would be 
subject to an effective tax rate of 15%. Most of those whose ordinary income is 
taxed at 15% would face an effective capital gains tax rate of 8.25%. And for 
those with adjusted gross incomes less than $20,000 -- including their taxable 
capital gains -- capital gains would be tax free. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had earlier floated the possibility of a flat 15% capital 
gains tax, but critics said that would provide no relief to low-income 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, the Bush proposal would define capital gains as profits from 
investments held for at least a year. But the required holding period would 
gradually rise to three years, to blunt criticism that the lower capital gains 
tax rate encourages the frequent churning of investments. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration also narrowed the scope of capital gains that would be 
eligible for favorable treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Previous law allowed taxpayers to invest in tax shelters that both provided 
lower-taxed capital gains and allowed large tax write-offs through depreciation 
of assets. The Bush plan would exclude corporations from the tax break for 
capital gains and profits from collectibles and depreciable assets such as 
investment real estate would not qualify as capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
That would serve to restrict the lower capital gains rate generally to stocks 
and bonds, although the sale of personal homes, when taxable, would also 
receive favorable tax treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration went on the offensive against critics who charge that a 
capital gains tax break would drain money from the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department assumes that Bush's proposal would encourage investors 
to sell more of their stocks and bonds than they otherwise would. That would 
more than compensate for the effect of the lower capital gains tax rate, 
Treasury says, and the Bush plan would actually generate an additional $4.8 
billion in revenues next year and $4.9 billion the following year. 
</P>
<P>
That estimate is highly controversial and is likely to be challenged by 
Congress' own tax experts. Nonetheless, economists generally concede that a 
capital gains tax cut would initially boost government revenues from 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
Over the longer run, however, there is little evidence that a cut in taxes on 
capital gains in itself generates higher revenues. Even the Treasury estimates 
show a substantial revenue loss several years down the road, forecasting 
revenue losses of $6.8 billion in 1994, when the capital gains holding period 
would go up to two years, and $11.3 billion in 1996, when the holding period 
would jump to three years. 
</P>
<P>
Over a 10-year period, according to the Treasury estimate, there would be no 
significant gain or loss in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, for all its efforts to overcome such well-known objections to 
providing a capital gains tax break, the Bush Administration has split apart 
the political alliance that rallied behind earlier efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a hard time generating much interest in the plan on Wall Street," 
concedes Bloomfield, the capital gains lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Cut Profits 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that investment firms reap most of their income from rapid 
turnover of stocks and bonds. Although they receive most of their business from 
pension funds and other institutional investors that generally are not subject 
to taxes, any Administration proposal that encourages individuals to hold their 
investments for at least three years might cut into Wall Street's profits. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, by excluding investments in depreciable property, the White 
House plan has also excluded, at least for now, politically powerful real 
estate developers from the coalition of supporters of a capital gains tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of Democrats who have sold their soul to nouveau-riche real 
estate developers," contends Michael Barker, the former chief economist of the 
Democratic Leadership Council, a group of moderate and conservative Democrats. 
"This plan doesn't provide their paymasters with much incentive to wheel and 
deal in tax shelters again." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all its problems, though, a capital gains tax cut remains high on 
Bush's agenda. And the lobbying support from such important groups as venture 
capitalists will provide additional momentum on the grounds that reducing 
capital gains taxes will spur more investment in riskier businesses that need 
help in competing against foreign firms. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we've got a lot of people in Congress who are worried about the 
competitiveness of the U.S., I'm still expecting some sort of restructuring of 
capital gains tax rates in time," says New York economic consultant A. Gary 
Shilling, a frequent Bush adviser in the past. "But I wouldn't hold my breath 
waiting for it to happen."

U.S. REPARATIONS TOO LATE FOR MANY INTERNEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-seven years ago, Edna Uraguchi was a housewife in Los Angeles. Then 
suddenly, Army officers took her to a camp called Gila River in Arizona, and 
she became a statistic -- one of 120,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry 
interned during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Uraguchi, now 76 and a retired barber, was one of 400 attending the 
annual Day of Remembrance for those who were incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
This might have been a celebration of sorts, since former President Ronald 
Reagan had signed a law last August for redress in the form of $20,000 payments 
to those interned and a formal apology. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Uraguchi and others attending the event at Los Angeles Trade Technical 
College in downtown Los Angeles said they felt frustration. The federal 
government is not moving fast enough to implement reparations, they said, and 
given the age of many of the internees, time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Have Died 
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 of the estimated 60,000 surviving internees have died since the law 
was signed, according to Robert Bratt, director of the Office of Redress 
Administration in the U.S. Department of Justice, and one of the speakers 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody says, 'Oh, you're going to get all that money,' " Uraguchi said. 
"But I don't know if I'll be here that long." 
</P>
<P>
So far President Bush has not made specific recommendations on the payments in 
his budget proposal, Bratt said. 
</P>
<P>
In his final budget, Reagan had requested an initial payment of $20 million -- 
enough to pay only 1,000 people -- to begin Oct. 1, 1989. Reagan did not ask 
for funds to start making payments during this fiscal year, which runs up to 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe there is going to be no difference" between the Bush and Reagan 
requests, Bratt said. 
</P>
<P>
Former internees said the money -- a total of $1.2 billion to be paid out over 
a 10-year period -- should come faster. 
</P>
<P>
"A wrong has been recognized, but it has not been redressed," said Alan Nishio, 
co-chair of the California-based National Coalition for Redress/Reparations, 
the organizers of Sunday's program. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not be redressed until those who have been wronged are compensated," 
added Nishio, a 43-year-old college administrator who was born at the Manzanar 
internment camp in California's Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The first generation are all in their 80s, 90s or even 100s," said Frank Emi, 
a 70-year-old retired postal worker who was interned as a young man at a camp 
called Heart Mountain in Wyoming. "Half of them will be gone by next year." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Saito, a 66-year-old Westside resident, who was incarcerated at a camp in 
Colorado, said he was "bitter" and felt that without prompt payment, the 
redress bill "is a bunch of rhetoric. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Remember the old saying, justice delayed is justice denied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During a candlelight commemoration part of the program, organizers hung 
placards containing the names of 300 former internees from Southern California 
who had died recently. Sunday was also the 47th anniversary of President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt's order to authorize internment of Americans of Japanese 
ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
Bratt, a speaker along with Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. James Turner and Rep. 
Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento), said his office has so far confirmed the 
identities of 45,000 internees through Social Security, motor vehicle or tax 
records. A search is under way for several thousand others, who are believed to 
be living in Japan or Canada, he added.

DANIEL W. FOX; INVENTED LEXAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel W. Fox, 65, a chemist who invented Lexan, the tough plastic used in 
everything from compact discs to the face mask of the first astronaut on the 
moon. Fox said luck played a large part in inventing General Electric Co.'s 
largest-selling product, a tough polycarbonate used in computer housings, 
automobile bumpers, baby bottles and construction materials. At the end of a 
series of experiments, Fox said, he found a stirring rod stuck in a gooey brown 
mass that had hardened in a beaker. He dropped the rod and glob down a 
three-story stairwell, and it would not break. When GE was searching for a 
tough plastic, Fox remembered the glob and recreated the experiment, producing 
an early version of Lexan. Fox joined GE in 1953 after obtaining a doctorate 
from the University of Oklahoma. He won many awards, including the GE Charles 
P. Steinmetz award in 1973 and the International Award of the Society of 
Plastics Engineers in 1985. In Pittsfield, Mass. on Wednesday of cancer.

TWIGGS GOES TO SCHOOL, WINS AT SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strapping Greg Twiggs went from local yokel to local hero thanks to local 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
The former San Diego State golfer shot a 69 Sunday for a 17-under par total of 
271 at the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open. The victory was worth $126,000 and an 
exemption from the tortures of PGA qualifying until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
It was his first tour victory, and it came on the municipal golf course, Torrey 
Pines South, where his power game matured. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs won because he knew where to hit the ball off the tee and where to aim 
his putts on the greens. As a college student he played here three times a 
week. That's when he learned the light rough at Torrey Pines is not a problem 
as long as your ball isn't behind a tree. He found only 12 fairways the last 
three days. But he hit 17 greens in regulation Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs won because third-round leader Steve Elkington of Australia bogeyed the 
fourth, fifth and sixth holes en route to a 73. Elkington finished in a 
four-way tie for second with second-round co-leader Mark Wiebe, last year's 
third-round leader Brad Faxon and Mark O'Meara of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs won because playing partner Wiebe missed an 18-inch birdie putt at the 
15th hole that gave Twiggs a comfortable three-shot lead with three holes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Mark that was a gimme," Twiggs said. "I hope he's still my friend." 
</P>
<P>
And Twiggs won despite himself. And despite his caddy. 
</P>
<P>
Before this week, Bret Finley, 222, never carried a golf bag. Not even his own. 
But he is the son of the sister of Twiggs' wife. And he works cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Twiggs said: "I had to show him how to carry the bag." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Twiggs got to the last fairway, Finley was holding up just fine and 
Twiggs had chased the butterflies from his stomach, the distress caused by the 
snuff he had tucked under his lip. 
</P>
<P>
"I had severe heartburn," he said. "Because I wouldn't take it out. . . . I 
chew and I smoke. . . . I'm slowly but surely trying to do everything wrong 
that will eventually kill me." 
</P>
<P>
His friends call him "Twiggy." It's a nickname that's almost as bad as his 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
Three putts at the par-three 16th hole shrunk his lead over Wiebe to two 
strokes. And the 240 pounds he drags around on his 6-foot-2 frame were 
beginning to make him weary. 
</P>
<P>
But a 330-yard drive that split the heart of the fairway at the 499-yard 18th 
killed everybody else's chances instead. From there, Twiggs feathered a 
178-yard six-iron to the safe part of the green. And from there he three-putted 
for par and the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Wiebe's long, downhill putt for eagle on 18 never got close. The four-way split 
he shared for second place money turned out to be $46,200. 
</P>
<P>
In four previous years on the PGA tour, Twiggs won a total of $98,520, more 
than $27,000 less than he won Sunday. His previous best finish in a tour event 
was a tie for third at the 1985 Greater Milwaukee Open. The most he had ever 
made in one year was $41,418 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs arrived in San Diego fresh from a discouraging Hawaiian Open, where he 
trailed the leaders by nine strokes before he hit his first drive. He 
eventually missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
But after 54 holes here he cut Elkington's lead to two shots on the strength of 
a third-round 64. When he sank an eight-footer for birdie on No. 2 he had cut 
Elkington's lead in half. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs answered a three-putt bogey on the third hole with a drive, a nine-iron 
and a 12-foot birdie putt on the 447-yard fourth. Suddenly he owned a share of 
the lead he would never lose. 
</P>
<P>
Birdies at 10, 13 and 14 were important. But his round turned on the 10-foot 
par-saving putt from the fringe he dropped on the 12th. His lead over Wiebe at 
the time was one. 
</P>
<P>
This one is the standard rags-to-riches stuff. Two and a half months ago Twiggs 
was the 52nd and last man to survive the 108-hole PGA qualifying school in Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
That meant he would be 52nd on the priority list of players allowed into tour 
events once the 126 exempt players took their spots in the field. The only 
reason there was a spot open for Twiggs at San Diego was because so many pros 
skipped this tournament to prepare for next week's $1.3 million Doral Ryder 
Open at Florida. The total purse in this tournament was $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Twiggs insisted the money won't change his life. "But it's a little easier to 
write checks for bills when you don't have to call up your accountant and say, 
'What's in there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mark O'Meara and Robert Wrenn tied for the low round of the day at 66. They 
will each receive a zero coupon Treasury certificate, worth $25,000 at maturity 
in 2099 from the tournament sponsor. O'Meara's round came despite jamming a 
hand Saturday night. The injury occurred when O'Meara slipped on the grass 
while walking to the lawn mower in his back yard where he was about to cut the 
grass on his 3,000 square foot putting green. . . . The Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Open team of Ray Barr Jr., Steve Pate, Sam Randolph and Brad Faxon finished a 
combined 48-under par in the Nabisco team standings. Each PGA tournament has a 
four-man team. The leaders in the team standings at the end of the season win 
money for local charities. The SLHO team moved from 17th to 10th in the 
standings thanks to its finish this week. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Frank Conner, Mark Lye and David Peoples, co-leaders after the 
first round? Conner followed his opening 65 with 74, 74, 76 for a one-over par 
289 good for 72nd place and $1,372. Only four golfers finished behind Conner. 
One was local amateur Steve Haase and one was Tom Purtzer, who withdrew after 
three rounds. Lye shot 70-74-73 the last three days for a six-under total of 
282, $2,252.25 and a share of 42nd. Peoples went 72-71-70 for 278, $7,147.00 
and a share of 19th. . . . The last San Diego area golfer to win this 
tournament was Billy Casper. . . . Greg Twiggs went to San Diego State but now 
lives in Palm Springs and plays out of Rancho Mirage.

I am a Little Leaguer who hopes to become a big leaguer, just like you. Please

Poly Pomona, died early Sunday from injuries she suffered in a Saturday 
automobile accident at Diamond Bar. She was 22. 
</P>
<P>
Anastasiadou, one of Greece's best female players, was the No. 1-ranked singles 
player in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division II this season. 
</P>
<P>
Her automobile was struck in an intersection by a car that apparently had brake 
failure, Cal Poly Pomona officials said in a statement Sunday. She was taken to 
San Dimas Community Hospital where she died Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Anastasiadou, a senior, was trying to become the first woman to win three 
consecutive single titles in Division II, said Ron Fremont, Cal Poly Pomona 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"She was not looking past this season," said Ann Lebedeff, Pomona's first-year 
coach. "We had recently talked about whether she wanted to get on to the (pro) 
circuit or graduate. She wanted to finish school." 
</P>
<P>
Lebedeff said Anastasiadou was earning a degree in physical education, and was 
considering a career in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"She probably would have been an assistant coach here next season," Lebedeff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona, which has three matches this week, plays host to Brigham Young 
Hawaii today. 
</P>
<P>
Lebedeff said Anastasiadou would expect the team, ranked No. 6 nationally, to 
continue playing as hard as she always did. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to have an effect on the kids," she said. "They are despondent, 
but they know that she would want them to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Anastasiadou, who has a sister living near Cal Poly Pomona, decided to attend 
the school three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Holycross, a former Cal Poly player who met Anastasiadou in Italy the 
summer before the Athens player entered Pomona, was surprised to learn they 
would be teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Though an aggressive player, she was a warm personality off the court, 
Holycross said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her family was the most important thing in her life," she said. "Her family 
came first. If she was your friend she would do anything for you." 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services are pending as her family is en route from Athens.

PINCAY WINS AGAIN WHEN THE STAKES ARE HIGH; 
</P>
<P>
HE SWEEPS WEEKEND FEATURES BY RIDING BAYAKOA HOME IN SANTA MARGARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early this season, Laffit Pincay would usually win the stakes races at Santa 
Anita on Wednesdays. Now he's winning the rich races every day. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, about 24 hours after he rode Kool Arrival to victory in the Las 
Virgenes, Pincay booted another filly home. Pincay and Bayakoa safely distanced 
themselves from heavily favored Goodbye Halo early and held on through the 
stretch for a two-length victory in the $300,000 Santa Margarita Handicap 
before a crowd of 35,526. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Pincay, 42, rode through most of the Santa Anita season with a sore 
back. The Panama native fractured a vertebra on the second day of the meeting 
and didn't resume riding for three weeks. He finished with only three stakes 
victories, not much of a showing for a jockey who has won more stakes at Santa 
Anita than anyone except Bill Shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Pincay's heady victory aboard Bayakoa Sunday was his 12th in a stake this 
meeting and another win on the card gave him 56 victories, only six short of 
what he registered all last season. With 30 stakes still to be run, Pincay is 
expected to break the record of 19 stakes victories that he set at Santa Anita 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Pincay's major winner was Chinook Pass, who won four stakes. This 
time, Kool Arrival has furnished Pincay with three stakes wins, but the rest 
have come with different horses, and seven of the 12 haven't been favored, 
which was Bayakoa's situation in the 1 1/8-mile Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Because Miss Brio, suffering from a bruised foot, was scratched, Bayakoa became 
the second choice in a seven-horse field, with Goodbye Halo, seeking her third 
straight victory this year, going off at 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
Even an accomplished filly such as Goodbye Halo wasn't able to spot Bayakoa 
seven pounds -- 125 to 118 -- and an 8 1/2-length lead after the first 
half-mile. Not only was Bayakoa on the lead, with Goodbye Halo in fifth place, 
but Pincay's 5-year-old mare also was not pressured by any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo and her jockey, Pat Day, narrowed the gap to four lengths with an 
eighth of a mile to go, but Bayakoa had plenty left. 
</P>
<P>
"When my horse opened up a four-length lead on the far turn, I got pretty 
confident," said Ron McAnally, who trains Bayakoa for Frank Whitham, a banker 
and cattleman from Leoti, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo finished 5 1/2 lengths ahead of No Review, who was a half-length 
ahead of Carita Tostada, the fourth-place finisher. The stewards disallowed a 
foul claim by Pat Valenzuela, Carita Tostada's jockey, against Day and Goodbye 
Halo for alleged interference on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa paid $9, $3.20 and $2.60, with Goodbye Halo returning $2.60 and $2.40 
and $3.40 for No Review. Bayakoa was timed in 1:48 2/5, a good time for a damp 
track listed as fast but playing dull all day. Bayakoa earned $180,000, which 
was $20,000 more than her career earnings for 17 previous starts. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally bought Bayakoa for an undisclosed sum on behalf of Whitman at the end 
of 1987. The mare won three of eight starts in Argentina, but McAnally had 
never seen her run and was concerned about one of her legs being slightly 
crooked. But a Kentucky veterinarian told McAnally that the problem didn't seem 
to affect her running. 
</P>
<P>
In America, Bayakoa won three of nine before Sunday, but her best races were 
two seconds against the consistent Miss Brio. Despite breaking through the gate 
before the Santa Maria Handicap three weeks ago, Bayakoa gave Miss Brio a 
battle before losing by less than a length. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Pincay was determined to get Bayakoa to relax in the gate, and she 
may have been too calm, because the break wasn't smooth. 
</P>
<P>
"She broke to the outside at the start," Pincay said. "I thought the only 
chance I had was for her to relax. I thought I would be on the lead, but I 
would have let somebody else go if they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"My horse was going real nice and easy around the first turn. She's got a lot 
of ability. I hit her left-handed in the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth time Pincay has won the Santa Margarita, which ties 
Shoemaker's record. 
</P>
<P>
Day conceded that Bayakoa got too far away from Goodbye Halo, but he still 
liked his filly's race. 
</P>
<P>
"She was not quite as aggressive in the body of the race as the last race," Day 
said of Goodbye Halo. "But she kicked hard at the end. When I called on her in 
the middle of the turn, she gave me as much as she could." 
</P>
<P>
Today, in the San Luis Obispo Handicap, Pincay rides Trokhos, who isn't 
expected to beat Great Communicator, the horse who won the stake and beat 
Trokhos last year. But a month ago Trokhos and Pincay won the San Marcos 
Handicap when they weren't supposed to, so there's no discounting a weekend hat 
trick for the sizzling jockey. It would have to be a Panama hat, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Albert Barrera, one of the six trainers whose horses have tested positive for 
cocaine, is scheduled to have a hearing with the Santa Anita stewards Thursday, 
but because of lengthy testimony, a ruling -- if there is one -- is expected to 
come later. At least one of Barrera's five horses has been turned over to his 
brother, Larry. Another Albert Barrera horse, Perceive Arrogance, is a 
candidate for the Santa Anita Handicap on March 5. . . . Because four of the 
horsemen named in the cocaine scandal -- including Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera 
-- had horses test positive in meetings before the current one at Santa Anita, 
their hearings will be before an administrative law judge rather than stewards. 
. . . A group of Santa Anita trainers met Sunday morning at the track to 
discuss changes in the trainer-responsibility rule. "It's difficult to have 
someone with your horses all the time, but I don't know how the rule could be 
changed," trainer Ron McAnally said. "How long has it been on the books? A 
hundred years?" 
</P>
<P>
McAnally's Hawkster, who has been working sharply at Hollywood Park, will be 
flown to Florida next weekend, to run in the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park 
on March 4. . . . Trainer Mel Stute said Double Quick, who has been working at 
Oaklawn Park since winning the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows, will run in 
the Remington Derby in Oklahoma City on March 8. . . . Chris McCarron will ride 
Cherokee Colony for the first time in the Santa Anita Handicap, replacing 
Rafael Meza. McCarron won the Big 'Cap with Alysheba last year. . . . Jose 
Santos, the Eclipse Award winner for 1988, will ride Stalwars in the Big 'Cap. 
</P>
<P>
The trial regarding the harness horsemen's lawsuit against the California Horse 
Racing Board, which alleges conflict of interest by some board members, begins 
Tuesday in Superior Court at Sacramento. . . . Emperor's Turn, who was the 
first of the six horses to test positive for cocaine, when he ran last October 
at Santa Anita, won Sunday's first race. Emperor's Turn has been claimed three 
times since he ran in the controversial race for trainer Roger Stein. 
</P>
<P>
Agotaras, winner of the Pasadena Stakes, is sidelined with a bone chip in the 
knee that will not require surgery. . . . Pen Bal Lady, winner of three major 
races last year, and is five or six weeks away from a race. . . . Starting 
Wednesday, Santa Anita's first post will be 1 p.m. . . . Alex Campbell Jr., 
co-owner of Goodbye Halo, didn't win the Santa Margarita, but his Dreamy Mimi 
captured Sunday's Busher Handicap at Aqueduct. . . . Jockey Julie Krone won the 
$200,000 Orchid Handicap with Gaily Gaily Sunday at Gulfstream Park, with Anka 
Germania finishing second in the final race of her career. . . . Vicky Aragon, 
whose arm is in a cast after cracking an elbow in a training accident at Golden 
Gate Fields, is recuperating in Los Angeles and won't resume riding for two 
months.

University of Kentucky basketball Coach Eddie Sutton "may have wanted a high 
school basketball coach 'to give false and misleading information to the NCAA,' 
" the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted from the university's response to 18 National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. allegations of wrongdoing in the men's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
The newpaper said Kentucky's response, which has not been made public, 
acknowledges as "substantially correct" an allegation involving the potentially 
false and misleading information that was given the NCAA in regard to the 
transportation of two recruits to a college-entrance exam. 
</P>
<P>
The coach could not be reached at his home for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the NCAA said recruits Eric Manuel and Sean Sutton, 
the coach's son, first told investigators the younger Sutton took Manuel to the 
test. Casey said he told Manuel "to catch a ride" with Sean Sutton, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey and the recruits later admitted both stories were false when Lafayette 
High School Coach Donnie Harville told the NCAA that he had driven the two 
students to the test. The Kentucky response said Casey later stated that he 
forgot the arrangement with Harville to take Manuel to the test site. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that its investigators got conflicting information from Casey and Eddie 
Sutton, Kentucky's response to the NCAA said, in part: 
</P>
<P>
"If true, Coach Casey's statement suggests that Coach Sutton wanted Coach 
Harville to give false and misleading information to the NCAA in order to cover 
up erroneous statements."

NEWSWIRE: BUDD DENOUNCES APARTHEID ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South African runner Zola Budd strongly condemned apartheid in a television 
interview in Johannesburg, telling viewers that she "always hated" any form of 
racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always felt in my heart that I hate apartheid and always resented it," 
Budd said. "I do not believe in the superiority of one race above another based 
on the color of a person's skin." 
</P>
<P>
Budd said she did not speak out strongly against apartheid in her prime running 
days in Britain because she did not want to "get involved in the hypocrisy of 
the anti-apartheid wagon." 
</P>
<P>
Budd returned to South Africa last May after a heated controversy in Britain 
regarding her links with South Africa.

SCOTT OSTLER: AS HE RE-COOPS GAME, HIS TIMING COULDN'T BE BETTER FOR LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The TV man pointed his microphone at Michael Cooper, asked a question, got an 
answer and started to move away to another Laker. 
</P>
<P>
"That's it?" Cooper asked incredulously. "Gimme that." 
</P>
<P>
He snatched the microphone from the startled TV man's hand, moved closer to the 
camera lens and went on a verbal rampage, praising teammates, coaches, fans, 
assorted clubhouse visitors and even reporters. 
</P>
<P>
It was an impressive demonstration of fast hands, quick tongue and aggressive 
nature, the three things that have made Cooper a scourge of the National 
Basketball Assn. for 10 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Coop's scourge rating took a significant dip last season, however, when he 
injured his left ankle, lost his defensive player of the year title to Michael 
Jordan and limped through an embarrassing playoffs, shooting .205 (nine for 44) 
in the NBA finals against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The once-feared three-point shooter had, seemingly overnight, become Dr. Brick, 
King of Clang, Captain Airball. It was grim. Never mind that Cooper was trying 
to shoot off one ankle. Two-oh-five! 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, you hit .205 and the arbitrator gives you a $1.3-million raise. In 
basketball, you hit .205 and you start wondering if the Italian League can use 
an over-the-hill, 6-foot-6, former defensive demon, Coop-a-loopist and 
all-around team spark plug. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you wonder how long the team will carry you out of sentiment, how long 
before the guys start hoping you'll get lost with the luggage, how long before 
you can shake off all the accumulated aches and pains and start playing with 
the old fire and flair. 
</P>
<P>
At Seattle on Jan. 3, Cooper played 3 minutes in the first half and never got 
off the bench in the second half. Quietly, Cooper seethed, angry at Pat Riley 
for the benching and embarrassed at his own play. 
</P>
<P>
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's slump was drawing national attention, but Cooper's slump 
was an item high on everyone's "What's wrong with the Lakers?" list. 
</P>
<P>
Then things happened. Byron Scott got sick, then Magic Johnson got hurt, and 
Cooper was thrust into the starting lineup. Conveniently, his injuries began to 
heal and over the last six weeks he has begun to resemble the old Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, playing point guard for still-recuperating Magic, Cooper had 13 
assists, the most he has had in a game in the last three seasons, and zero 
turnovers in 34 minutes. Lakers 119, Celtics 110. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that's a line I can live with," Cooper said, scanning his numbers on the 
game's stat sheet. He had 11 points, a three-point shot, four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's shot is returning, and so is the patented Cooper leer, something he 
picked up from all those "Friday the 13th" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" type 
movies he loves to watch. 
</P>
<P>
He is starting to get on people's nerves. People on the other team. Last 
Tuesday, during a brief altercation, Cooper grabbed Detroit center Bill 
Laimbeer by the throat and squeezed. Not exactly league-sanctioned 
hand-checking, but something Cooper felt was needed at the time to convince the 
Piston enforcer to play with a little more finesse. 
</P>
<P>
That was always Cooper's forte, lending presence and atmosphere to a game. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go out and look in (Celtic forward) Reggie Lewis' eyes," Cooper said, 
"he had a sense, well, I hope I was passing the message that it would be a long 
day for him." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis got 25, but not all off Cooper. On one play in the first half, Cooper 
caught Celtic rookie Brian Shaw from behind on a breakaway layup, ignored 
Shaw's head fake, and swatted away Shaw's shot, just as he used to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finally healed," Cooper said. "All the nagging injuries have cleared up, 
I'm finally feeling like myself. I'm getting through picks now." 
</P>
<P>
He is also getting more playing time, having started the last 10 games, for 
Scott and more recently for Johnson. Cooper indicated that the increased court 
time has contributed greatly to his improved performance. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, whose locker is next to Cooper's in the Forum dressing room, 
overheard Cooper and joined the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, then maybe I'll stay out a little longer, get him some playing time," 
Johnson said, ominously. "Maybe I'll stay out another month. Two months." 
</P>
<P>
Easy, Magic, easy. Cooper doesn't want all your time. He just doesn't want any 
more of those three-minute games. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is 32, and he has bulked up to 176 pounds, way over his rookie weight of 
175. But he has made the league's all-defensive team eight consecutive years 
(five times on the first team), and he can still bug the hell out of the other 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly Cooper gives you what is known as the intangibles. For instance, with 
his left ankle, which never mended completely, "I can tell you when it's going 
to be a cold day, when it's going to rain." 
</P>
<P>
Not for long. For Cooper the meteorologist, the reign of pain is mainly on the 
wane.

ATLANTA FALLS FLAT AND GETS FLATTENED BY HEAT, 124-115 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when it appeared the Atlanta Hawks were about to turn it on, they 
flattened out against a team they should handle easily. 
</P>
<P>
They had won three in a row, including a win over powerful Cleveland Friday 
night, when they went into Miami Sunday night to play the pitiful Heat. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat were hot, the Hawks cold and a virtually unknown rookie, Grant Long, 
destroyed them. The 6-foot-8 former Eastern Michigan forward had 30 points and 
10 rebounds as the Heat scored a 124-115 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat built a 20-point lead several times before Dominique Wilkins and Glenn 
Rivers led an Atlanta rally that cut the lead to 113-109 with four minutes 
left. In the next two minutes, another rookie, Ron Seikaly scored five points 
to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Heat's record is only 7-42, this is a night the fans may remember 
for awhile. They didn't just beat a quality team, they set club records for 
points, topping the old record by six, a quarter high (38) and a record for a 
half (72). They have won two in a row to tie another record. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks, in a letdown following the win over the Cavaliers -- the team with 
the best record in the NBA -- shot only 43% from the field against Miami -- the 
team with the worst record. 
</P>
<P>
Long made 10-of-14 shots, while two other rookies had big games. Kevin Edwards 
had 21 points and seven rebounds, while Seikaly scored 14 points in 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat tries for a record three in a row tonight at New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 108, Milwaukee 106 -- It doesn't make any difference whether Michael 
Jordan scores 50 points or 23, the Bulls seem able to handle the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 50, including a 20-foot jumper in the final second Thursday at 
Chicago to give the Bulls a 117-116 victory.

In this one at Milwaukee, Jordan scored eight of his 23 points in the fourth 
quarter to help the Bulls beat the Bucks for the fourth time this season. The 
Bulls have won six in a row at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's passing, not his shooting did in the Bucks in this one. He had nine 
assists, two of them on scores by Brad Sellers, who had six points in the final 
2:40 to thwart Bucks' hopes of a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we can beat the Bucks," Bulls' Coach Doug Collins said. "We 
can't beat Detroit, and the Bucks beat the stuffings out of them. Matchups are 
so important in this game." DAN HAFNER

MAVERICKS OWNER TRYING TO END DANTLEY'S HOLDOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Though recently acquired Adrian Dantley still hasn't joined the Dallas 
Mavericks, owner Donald Carter is trying to remain patient. 
</P>
<P>
Carter flew to Washington Sunday night and met Dantley and his agent to discuss 
when the team's newest player could join the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Carter and Dantley, along with Dantley's agent, David Falk, were still meeting 
late Sunday night at a Washington hotel, where Carter went after flying in his 
private plane to the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
Carter refused to talk to the media after he arrived in Washington, but said 
earlier he hoped that after their meeting Dantley would return with him to 
Dallas on Carter's plane. 
</P>
<P>
"We're his sixth team in the NBA and I can understand why he would want to meet 
with the owner of the new team he is going to play for," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
Dantley, angered when the Detroit Pistons traded him to the Mavericks for Mark 
Aguirre and a 1991 draft pick, has missed two games since the trade Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dantley is losing $15,000 for each game he misses. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks also have been hurt by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Derek Harper has a knee injury and will not play in tonight's game at San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Center Bill Wennington has a sprained ankle and did not play in Saturday 
night's 105-94 loss to the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Sam Perkins is bothered by a sore kneecap, and Brad Davis played 
against the Rockets with a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman is playing with a splint on a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Roy Tarpley is undergoing treatment for drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hurting right now," Dallas Coach John MacLeod said. "We need Dantley 
bad. I hope he gets here soon." 
</P>
<P>
Without Dantley, Dallas has no proven scorer in its front line. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Tyler, who started in Aguirre's small forward spot, scored only two 
points against the Rockets. Detlef Schrempf, coming off the bench, had 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, contending for one of the eight playoff spots in the Western 
Conference, are seventh, one game ahead of Portland and 1 1/2 games ahead of 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas plays at San Antonio tonight.

CS LONG BEACH TO FACE NEVADA LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach's men's basketball team, which has a four-game winning 
streak, plays the University of Nevada Las Vegas in a Big West Conference game 
at 7:30 tonight in the Thomas and Mack Center at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach is coming off a 66-52 victory over New Mexico State Saturday night, 
which moved the 49ers above .500 (12-11) for the first time this season. They 
also moved into a second-place tie with New Mexico State with a 9-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
In their victory over the Aggies, the 49ers were led by Tyrone Mitchell, who 
had 16 points, four assists and eight rebounds and center John Hatten, who also 
had 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach has allowed an average of 51.5 points during its winning streak, the 
49ers' longest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, ranked 18th, is 18-6 overall and 11-2 in conference play and is 
coming off of a 62-60 victory over Temple Sunday. Greg Anthony and Anderson 
Hunt scored 17 points each and Stacey Augmon had 16 to lead the Rebels, who 
have a 2 1/2-game lead over the 49ers in the Big West.

<P>
KINGS' JAY MILLER IS FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT TO CHANGE REPUTATION IN THE NHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS , Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A chuckle was heard 'round the National Hockey League when, in the same week, 
Wayne Gretzky of the Kings took a firm and formal stance against fighting while 
the Kings were making a trade for Jay Miller of Boston, a player whose 
credentials begin with his records for penalty minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Miller chuckled a little, too, when he read that Gretzky was suggesting slowly 
initiating some rules against fighting over the next three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
"One way for me to read that would be to say, 'Great, phase out my job after my 
career is over,' " Miller said. "But another way to read it would be to say, 
'Yeah, right, Gretzky wants us out of the league, but not until his career is 
over.' 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to understand something. Guys like Gretzky -- the goal scorers, the 
finesse players -- do not like to be hit. They do not like to be intimidated. 
They do not like to be pushed around. 
</P>
<P>
"Take away the physical players from his side, and there are going to be 
physical players on the other side out there trying to take advantage of him. 
It would take a couple of years off his career if he had to go out there every 
night and get knocked around by the Lemieuxs of Montreal, the Tocchets of 
Philadelphia, the Mark Hunters, the Peplinskis, the Ottos. 
</P>
<P>
"My job is to keep those guys off of him. I've made a career of it. Maybe we 
don't have to drop our gloves every time, but supply and demand says that if 
one side doesn't have any so-called 'role players' the other side is going to 
get physical with the goal scorers." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Miller understands his role and he makes no apologies for it. He knows 
other roles, but he took on this one quite deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, I was a player in college," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
While he was earning a degree in business administration at the University of 
New Hampshire, Miller also played defense and all three forward positions for 
the college team. When he was drafted by Quebec as a freshman in 1980, he chose 
to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
After floating around in the minor leagues for a couple of years, Miller took 
himself aside and told himself that enough was enough. It was time to 
concentrate his efforts on a real career in business. He had been selling and 
maintaining swimming pools in the summer when he was at home in Boston with his 
parents, and he thought he might develop that business. 
</P>
<P>
That was when it was suggested he could develop a career as a role player in 
the NHL. After all, he is a strong, 6-foot-2, 210-pound player. 
</P>
<P>
He auditioned for the role by getting into a fight with John Blum 10 minutes 
into his tryout at the Boston Bruins' training camp in 1985. When he signed 
with the Bruins as a free agent that October, there was no question of his 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In Boston, Miller established himself as one of the league's premier tough 
guys. In his third season, he broke Coach Terry O'Reilly's club record for 
penalty minutes, getting 302 minutes in one season. He also broke Derek 
Sanderson's club record for penalty minutes in a playoff season with 124. 
</P>
<P>
In his first three seasons as a Bruin he had 11 goals and 16 assists. When he 
was traded to Los Angeles Jan. 22 he had a career total of 856 penalty minutes 
and 33 points -- a ratio of about 26-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
Since he has been with the Kings, the ratio is not nearly so lopsided. In his 
10 games with the Kings he has four goals and one assists for five points. He 
also has 40 penalty minutes. That's a ratio of eight-to-one. And he's even in 
plus/minus statistics. 
</P>
<P>
He likes that. 
</P>
<P>
"Being traded to the Kings gave me a new lease on life," Miller said. "It's not 
only a change of scene and a lot of great guys, but it's a winning team, a 
chance to win a Stanley Cup, it's all the way out of the division so I don't 
have to be up tight about playing against the guys I grew up with, and it's a 
team that will give me a chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
"(General Manager) Rogie (Vachon) and (Coach) Robbie (Ftorek) told me that my 
role here would be a little bit different. I'll be able to play and protect. In 
Boston, it was just protect." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said that his playing time was down to about two shifts a game, partly 
because the Adams Division isn't as physical as it once was. He shrugs off the 
talk that he wasn't getting along with O'Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time your playing is down like that, you know to expect a trade," Miller 
said. "I was kind of glad when it was L.A." 
</P>
<P>
That is, if he had to be traded at all from the only NHL team he ever played 
for in the city where his family lives. 
</P>
<P>
There's no denying he still has a strong allegiance to the Bruins. He says the 
two games he played for the Kings against Boston were two of the worst games he 
has ever played. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who think that Miller was needed in Los Angeles before the 
playoffs began because Marty McSorley might feel the same way about mixing it 
up with some of his former Edmonton Oiler teammates. 
</P>
<P>
But what if the Kings were to meet the Boston Bruins in the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
"That would have to be for the Stanley Cup, and that would be different," 
Miller said, brightening at the thought. "Believe me, I'd have no problem with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
At 28, Miller is getting near the end of his career. Next year will be his 
option year, so he'll have to decide, after this season, where he thinks his 
future lies. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife (Paula) is staying in Boston for now because she has her own career 
there, and that leaves me free to put total concentration into playing hockey," 
Miller said. "It's been so long since I've really played much, I need to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody seems to think that there are two norms in hockey -- goons and 
hockey players. Who says somebody can't do both roles? I've shown that I can 
put the puck in the net. I have 11 points. If I had zero, then you could call 
me a goon or a cement head. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get back to playing the way I know I can play. I want to play for 
the Los Angeles Kings in the future and be a part of what I know is going to be 
a winning tradition. I know what my role is; Robbie doesn't have to explain 
that to me. But the thing I like about the Kings is that they can use me the 
way I'm supposed to be used and not treat me like a piece of meat -- not that 
I'm saying Boston treated me like a piece of meat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to be with a team that is giving me a chance to be a hockey 
player. A tough, mean, aggressive, hard-checking, maybe even bullyish, hockey 
player."

NEWSMAKERS: THEY'LL SOON MAKE MARRIAGE THE STATE OF THEIR UNION

In sickness and in health, until Election Day do they part, should read the 
wedding vows of Maine Rep. Olympia J. Snowe and Gov. John R. McKernan Jr., who 
credit politics with cementing their decade-long courtship. The two Republicans 
will marry Friday at the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity in Lewiston 
and will then divide their time between Washington and the executive mansion in 
Augusta. "What holds our relationship together is the fact that we love 
politics," said Snowe, now in her sixth term in Congress. "For some, that 
becomes a dividing factor, but in our case that obviously hasn't been the 
situation." Says McKernan, a former two-term congressman who was elected 
governor in 1986: "We understand the pressures that are on each other." The 
romance blossomed while the two were in Washington, serving as Maine's 
delegation in the House. Their private joke on their trips home: "Your district 
or mine?" Their honeymoon will be a weekend in New York, as McKernan must be in 
Washington next week for a meeting of the nation's governors.

 -- His culinary tastes are suspicious (he prefers green eggs) and his villain 
(the Grinch) is as nasty a character as you'd ever hope to meet in a Brothers 
Grimm tale. But one can't dispute the influence of the ubiquitous Dr. Seuss on 
children worldwide, says Ruth K. MacDonald, who has become an expert on the 
literature of Theodor Seuss Geisel. While her colleagues painstakingly pick 
apart Shakespeare and Chaucer, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, 
MacDonald, head of the English and philosophy department at Purdue 
University-Calumet in Indiana, pores over "The Cat in the Hat" and "Horton 
Hears a Who." MacDonald lauds the playfulness of Geisel's language, and notes 
that his books' themes let children be children. "He has loud and rowdy 
stories. You don't get rewarded for being good but for being outrageous," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of storybook endings, Popeye, the pugilist who first weighed 
anchor as a minor character in a now-forgotten comic strip, is still going 
strong at 60. Popeye, who appears in 250 newspapers worldwide and speaks 25 
languages, first appeared in 1929 in the "Thimble Theater" comic strip -- 
featuring Olive Oyl and her family -- when two of the characters were going on 
a boat trip and needed a sailor, said Carl Langrock of King Features, which 
syndicates the comic strip. "He was written in and out several times during 
1929," Langrock said. "But people responded so strongly to his character, 
because Popeye is really Everyman fighting back against bullies and tyranny."

A NEW $8-BILLION ORBITING NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE MILITARY AND 
MARINERS ALIKE WITH ACCURATE POSITIONING ALL OVER THE GLOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There was a quarter moon that night, but a thick fog blotted it from view. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 a.m. a computer science technician named Valerie Wong stood in a 
parking lot in Monrovia and pointed a gray battery-powered plastic box at the 
heavens and homed in on some military satellites. 
</P>
<P>
She was trying to find out, literally, where she stood. 
</P>
<P>
The screen flashed 34 degrees, 8.38 minutes north; 117 degrees, 59.77 minutes 
west. "This is going to be accurate within 30 meters," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
Punching some buttons on a computerized receiver to find your position doesn't 
quite have the romance of Capt. James Cook squinting through a sextant in the 
18th Century to guide his ship to the Pacific, or of Charles Lindbergh nosing 
the Spirit of St. Louis down to within 10 feet of the Atlantic so he could look 
at the waves to gauge the wind and help keep him on course to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But the Air Force's new collection of navigation satellites, called Global 
Positioning System, will help people find their way around the globe with more 
precision than ever before. The $8-billion project will provide the military 
with navigation sitings accurate to about 50 feet anywhere in the world, day or 
night, in the worst of weather. 
</P>
<P>
This degree of accuracy is available only at the high-level military frequency 
used by GPS, which eventually will require encryption devices to decode. 
Another channel, with an accuracy of roughly 300 feet, is planned for broadcast 
in the open for anyone -- foreign, domestic, military or civilian -- to use. 
</P>
<P>
Surveyors, oil firms, aerospace companies and the military have tested and 
generally liked GPS, and in the next few years GPS receivers will be installed 
in planes, boats and even cars. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment only eight test GPS satellites are in orbit, so there are gaps in 
coverage around the globe, including certain areas of the South Pacific and 
some of the polar regions. 
</P>
<P>
At this time of year the satellite coverage is available in Los Angeles about 
five hours a day, which is why Wong was out so early. She works for Magellan 
Systems, a small company that plans to begin selling in March $3,000 portable 
2-pound GPS receiver that, on the power of six penlight batteries, will help 
sailors find their way around the world. Until the Air Force starts beaming out 
two signals, civilian users will have access to the military-quality signal. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force took the first step to boost GPS to full-time coverage last week 
with the launch of the first of the next batch of satellites from Cape 
Canaveral. Several satellites will be fired up each year until the full 
constellation of 21 to 24 satellites is completed in 1992, which in six orbital 
planes will blanket the Earth from about 11,000 miles up. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, there are plenty of other navigation tools, including various modern 
radio beacons. But these have their weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"People have found a way to cope with other navigation systems," said Thomas 
Stansell, director of advanced programs for Magnavox, which, along with 
Rockwell International and several other companies, makes GPS receivers for the 
military. "What they are going to find out about GPS is it does it better than 
anything else they've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets seem to agree. They are launching their own copycat design called 
Global Navigation Satellite System, a 24-satellite system for their military, 
with plans to offer Glonass for civilian use worldwide as well. 
</P>
<P>
Two researchers from the University of Leeds in England have been tracking 
Glonass and their early reviews aren't glowing. Depending on who is counting, 
the Russians have launched from 27 to 39 Glonass satellites, yet only a handful 
are working properly. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force's GPS satellites work by a combination of atomic clocks and radio 
beacons, but the basic navigation principle is as old as the sextant. It uses 
time and several points of reference in the sky to plot a fixed position. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the satellites has four atomic clocks that are accurate to within 
50-billionths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
A GPS receiver must locate signals from four satellites to calculate its three 
dimensional position: longitude, latitude and altitude. Because each satellite 
constantly emits a signal that identifies its position as well as a time check, 
a GPS receiver can measure how long it took to receive a signal and, by 
multiplying it by the speed of light with the help of some computer-aided 
trigonometry, can continuously come up with a precise fix. 
</P>
<P>
The first GPS test satellites were launched in 1978, and the American military 
is sold on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon as you let the troops get their hands on it, they come back with nothing 
but praise for the system. The equipment is its own best advertisement," said 
Air Force Col. Marty T. Runkle, GPS program director. 
</P>
<P>
The military has 23,000 GPS receivers on order. Some infantry soldiers haul 
around GPS receivers that are a compact 10 by 12 by 4 inches, and the Army 
wants half of its tanks equipped with GPS receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Other sets will go into fighter planes (the most expensive receivers are for 
this purpose and cost $45,000), ships, submarines and missiles. Magnavox's GPS 
sets, Stansell said, have been used "on every mine-sweeping task force in the 
Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
GPS is expected to be particularly helpful to pilots because several 
established navigation systems have troubling imperfections. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration operates 970 high-frequency transmitting 
stations that provide navigational fixes accurate to within 1 nautical mile. 
The trouble is that the signals travel line of sight and, because of the 
curvature of the Earth, a pilot must switch from one station to another every 
100 miles or so. Even worse, the signals are blocked by mountains and are 
worthless in rugged areas. 
</P>
<P>
Another common land-based radio signal is Loran, which helps ships and planes 
find their way within 75 miles of the American and Canadian coastline. But bad 
weather, notably thunderstorms, scrambles the Loran signal. 
</P>
<P>
On long flights over water, commercial and military jets rely on inertial 
navigation, which is essentially a combination of a fancy gyroscope that 
creates a reference point by spinning in the direction of the North Pole and a 
sophisticated speedometer that charts the distance traveled. 
</P>
<P>
The gyroscope's bearings create friction that causes it to drift slightly, 
however, so the longer a flight, the greater the error. Pilots expect an 
inertial system to be wrong by 1 nautical mile per hour of flight. 
</P>
<P>
It's also essential that the pilot punch in his correct position before taking 
off; it he makes a mistake, the inertial system keeps compounding the blunder, 
which may explain why in 1983 a Korean Air Line jet was 300 miles off course 
over Soviet airspace when Russian fighters shot it down. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing navigation engineer John Neilsen expects GPS to be commonplace in 
airliners within 10 years, and he favors GPS as a tool for civilian planes. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA is excited about GPS for both safety and cost reasons. Most airline 
pilots want to fly with the jet stream to arrive faster and save fuel, but on 
flights above 29,000 feet, planes must be separated laterally by at least 2,000 
feet, so some must fly a less direct route. 
</P>
<P>
"All aircraft want to fly in the same place, and you can't do that now," said 
Clyde Miller, manager of the FAA's advanced concepts division. 
</P>
<P>
With GPS's accuracy, he said, more planes "lanes" could be squeezed together, 
as extra, but narrower, lanes might be added on a freeway. More efficient 
flying on the busy North Atlantic route, Miller said, could save $450 million a 
year in fuel. 
</P>
<P>
For all the dazzle of GPS, there remain some bugs to work out. Private industry 
hates the idea of the military cutting back the civilian accuracy to 100 yards. 
Why a separate, less-accurate signal for civilians? "You wouldn't want to 
provide the enemy the same advantage you are getting yourself," Runkle said. 
</P>
<P>
The civilian aviation community is also leery about depending solely on GPS 
because it fears that in a crisis, the military might cut off the civilian 
signal. Another weakness in both GPS and Glonass is that if a satellite is 
faulty and sends out bad signals, there is no immediate warning to civilians. 
The FAA is pressing for a 10-second GPS warning system, and it may set up 
ground stations to monitor the satellites for faulty signals. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems aside, Chrysler thinks there is a dollar to be made on GPS and 
has hooked up a GPS test system in a mini-van that plots positions on a 
television screen with street maps shown in quarter square mile detail. Robert 
Jensen, production engineering manager for Chrysler's Acustar division, says 
that if GPS is on schedule, Chrysler can sell a GPS navigation system as an 
option its 1993 luxury cars for about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
As prices drop, Jensen says, GPS could become standard equipment in rental 
cars. "If you do a lot of traveling and arrive in a city for the first time and 
don't know where to begin, GPS is ideal," he said. "It's like having somebody 
next to you who knows where to go."

MEDICAL MAYHEM THAT'S FUNNIER THAN A CRUTCH RECOUNTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A farmer in Belfast, Ireland, practiced do-it-yourself cardioversion -- slowing 
a too-rapidly beating heart -- for 30 years before finally consenting to have a 
pacemaker implanted, according to a recent report in the British Medical 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
When the palpitations began in 1954, the farmer initially jumped off a barrel 
in his farmyard, slamming his feet hard when he landed. Later he used a ladder, 
which was higher. Alternatively, he would fire a 12-gauge shotgun. As his 
condition began to get more serious, he would take off his clothes and jump 
into a cold water tank. Finally, he would grasp a six-volt electrical cattle 
fence, a procedure that worked best when he was wearing hobnailed boots. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, said Dr. J. A. McKnight, a physiologist at the Royal Victoria 
Hospital in Belfast, the farmer brought his electrical fence into the hospital 
and demonstrated its use to slow his heart. But they concluded that his methods 
were "a little extreme for standard medical teaching." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight's tale was one of several in the normally staid British Medical 
Journal's year-end issue, which is traditionally reserved for stories of the 
bizarre. The journal saves all its odder submissions over the course of the 
year, said Editor Steven Lock, and puts them into one issue "that makes a 
particularly good read for people with their feet up" during the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of the retired rat catcher who thought he had suffered a stroke. 
To lessen the chances of a recurrence, he treated himself with warfarin, an 
anti-coagulant that is used to kill rats by making them bleed to death. 
</P>
<P>
"On alternate days he dipped his wet finger into the (warfarin) powder and then 
sucked it," according to Dr. R. M. Kirby, a surgeon at the North Stafforshire 
Royal Infirmary in Stoke-on-Trent. The pest controller finally had to stop his 
therapy and go to the infirmary when he developed rectal bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
Orthopedic surgeons took a particular beating in the issue. Dr. J. J. Dias, 
himself an orthopedic surgeon at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, recounted how 
a fellow surgeon made a "sweeping incision" just as a colleague took his place 
by his side. The colleague was stabbed in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, his colleague was well-endowed in this area," so the damage was 
not severe. 
</P>
<P>
Dias cited another instance in which a colleague trying to insert a metal pin 
in a broken leg "managed to transfix his assistant's hand and impale the 
patient's other leg, giving a whole new meaning to dynamic external fixation of 
fractures."

Physicians believe they may have found a drug that can dramatically reduce the 
craving for cocaine and that could lead to successful treatments for cocaine 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary, unpublished study by psychiatrists at the University of 
Minnesota School of Medicine in Minneapolis showed that carbamazepine, a drug 
long used to prevent seizures and treat certain forms of depression, can 
control cocaine cravings well enough for addicts to benefit from more 
traditional forms of treatment. With traditional therapy alone -- withdrawal 
from the cocaine along with psychotherapy -- more than 80% of addicts go back 
to using cocaine within a year after leaving treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Cocaine treatment fails because patients are trapped by craving, by a 
compulsion to use cocaine," said Dr. James Halikas, co-director of the chemical 
dependency treatment program at the University of Minnesota and study director. 
"We feel that we may have found (a drug) . . . that cures or that eliminates 
craving." 
</P>
<P>
Many drug-abuse researchers think that cocaine, which activates the brain's 
pleasure centers, is the most addictive of regularly abused drugs.

IN BRIEF: ALCOHOL, MUSCLE HARM LINKED

A lifetime of heavy alcohol abuse can damage the heart by weakening the body's 
muscles, according to a new study. Researchers concluded that people risk 
muscle damage if their lifetime consumption of pure alcohol is more than 13 
kilograms for each kilogram of body weight. This is the equivalent of a 
150-pound man drinking more than 12 ounces of whiskey a day for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors long assumed that weakness among heavy drinkers, a condition called 
chronic alcoholic myopathy, resulted from malnutrition, because alcoholics 
often eat poorly. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new study found that such muscle wasting, including weakness of 
the heart muscle, was also common among alcoholics who lived in stable homes 
and ate well. 
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted on 50 alcoholic men by Dr. Alvaro Urbano-Marquez and 
colleagues from the University of Barcelona in Spain. The results were 
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
They found that one-third of the alcoholics had weakness of the heart muscle, 
and nearly half had abnormalities in other muscles.

<P>
 -- "We can't loan your country any more money. You see, we're in debt 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We're going to reduce the debt, not just the deficit. Reducing the deficit 
only means we're overspending a little less than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We can't just give you a welfare check -- would you be willing to work if 
excellent, free child-care is provided?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Just because I've been selling drugs, you're telling me that you're going 
to lock me up and throw away the key?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- "What do you mean that owning an assault rifle is a felony?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- "As your congressman, I'm going to start listening to what the people want 
instead of the NRA." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "I'm guilty. I feel that I owe something to society and do not wish to 
cause the huge expense of a trial." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We are not going to build that $8-million military plane, but instead we 
are going to use the funds for low-income housing for working families."

Hazelwood's piece is nothing less than a blueprint for United States escalation 
of the civil war in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
It has most of the ingredients of another Vietnam-style American commitment to 
that ongoing struggle, from the use of "more (U.S.) Special Forces-qualified 
personnel in contested rural areas" (i.e., in combat zones) to the employment 
of the Agency for International Development (read CIA) in Salvadoran "community 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
The only good thing that can be said for this former marine's plan is its open 
espousal. Confronted with four more years of a Republican Administration, I 
guess we have to console ourselves with an attitude of "better Hazelwood than 
North!"

ENVIRONMENTAL LOOPHOLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A critical gap in state environmental law turned up last year during a 
controversy over building a hazardous-waste incinerator in Vernon. The loophole 
involves gathering full information on past health and safety violations, if 
any, by firms proposing to build such plants. A bad record should weigh heavily 
in an agency's judgment about permiting a new facility. It also would be 
something that the public is entitled to know. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires a government agency to check a firm's past environmental 
record while itis deciding whether a proposal to build a waste-treatment plant 
requires an environmental-impact report. But the law doesn't require that the 
state agency include that information in its public notice about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In the Vernon case a Times survey of public records found that the company 
involved had been cited for dozens of health and safety violations at 
infectious-waste incinerators in Garden Grove and Long Beach. Two incinerators 
operated by Security Environmental Systems in Garden Grove were shut down in 
1986 under pressure from the South Coast Air Quality Management District. In 
one case a company official even brandished an open container of medical waste 
and told an inspector to dump it on the district's enforcement chief. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal Allard (D-Los Angeles) has introduced legislation 
to make the law more specific. AB 411 would require a state agency that is 
ruling on an environmental-impact statement to include information about any 
major environmental-law violations within the last three years when it 
announces its decision. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation also would prohibit the state Department of Health 
Services from issuing operating permits for hazardous-waste facilities if a 
firm had violated any of the major environmental laws. That's probably too 
harsh; a company may have been cited but may have cleaned up its act. This part 
of the bill needs refining, but the proposal gives legislators and the 
Deukmejian Administration a place to start. 
</P>
<P>
The Vernon case would have been clearer if the public and all the government 
agencies involved had been better informed. The more information on the public 
record and the tighter the laws regarding the application of that information 
to future cases, the better the public will be protected.

CELEBRATE GEORGE WASHINGTON, NOT FOR THE CHERRY TREE TALE BUT AS A MAN OF 
CHARACTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL K. LONGMORE, Paul K. Longmore is the author of The Invention of George 
Washington (University of California Press, 1988). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week marks the 257th anniversary of George Washington's birth, this year 
the bicentennial of his inauguration as President. 
</P>
<P>
If the thousands of volumes written about Washington were laid end to end, even 
that legendary hurler probably could not throw a silver dollar across them. Yet 
we do not know the man. We have relegated him to tales of hatchets and cherry 
trees, to antiquarian shrines and February sale ads. He is little more than a 
purse-lipped visage on our money. By trivializing him, we miss the lessons he 
could teach us. 
</P>
<P>
We imagine Washington to have been aloof and stiff. In fact, he was a man of 
personal charm and physical grace. These attributes contributed to the majestic 
presence that his contemporaries found so impressive. "His person," said Thomas 
Jefferson, "was fine, his stature exactly what one would wish, his deportment 
easy, erect and noble. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary War generation feared charismatic figures who could play upon 
the passions of the people in order to make themselves dictators. Washington's 
dignified and reserved demeanor helped to assure them that they could trust him 
with power. 
</P>
<P>
The impression Washington made was no accident. He consciously cultivated a 
style that fit the ideals and fears of his contemporaries. He deliberately set 
out to persuade them of his trustworthiness. In doing so, he displayed his 
genius as a political actor. He was not a hypocritical manipulator or a mere 
image created by media handlers. He and his contemporaries believed that a 
leader's exterior manner should reflect his interior character. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days after his appointment as commander of the Continental Army, Washington 
demonstrated the linkage between his skill at political symbolism and his 
trustworthiness. Many Americans feared abuses of military power. History was 
filled with examples of popular military leaders who had become tyrants. New 
York's revolutionary legislature praised the general's ability and virtue, but 
then registered its concern "that whenever this important Contest shall be 
decided . . . You will chearfully resign the important Deposit committed into 
Your Hands, and reassume the Character of our worthiest Citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Washington tailored his reply to allay the fear of military despotism. On 
behalf of his fellow generals, he wrote: "When we assumed the Soldier, we did 
not lay aside the Citizen, &amp; we shall most sincerely rejoice with you in 
that happy Hour, when the establishment of American Liberty . . . shall enable 
us to return to our private Stations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This statement was not just shrewd public relations. It set the tone for all of 
Washington's future public service. "His was the singular destiny and merit," 
said Jefferson, "of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his 
career, civil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes no 
other example." Washington's consistent submission to civilian authority and 
the laws helped establish an American tradition of civilian control of the 
military and constitutional restraints on the use of power. Thus have we been 
spared the tragic betrayal of our revolution, so often suffered by other 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
George Washington deserves our gratitude for his sense of civic duty, but the 
achievement was not his alone. His fellow citizens made it unmistakably clear 
what they required of him. Obedience to legal limits and subordination to 
elected leaders would win him lasting fame. Abuse of the powers granted him 
would bring down everlasting execrations. 
</P>
<P>
Some of us today naively excuse lawless abuses by soldiers and presidential 
advisers and Presidents because they were promoting policies that we favor. 
Others cynically dismiss such misconduct because "they all do it." 
</P>
<P>
Washington and the revolutionary generation would have found our attitudes 
antithetical to the kind of government and public morality they demanded of one 
another and labored to hand down to us. They would never have considered 
Richard M. Nixon an elder statesman or Oliver L. North a national hero. When we 
laud such men or allow them to profit by their violation of the public trust, 
when we fail to hold our leaders to the standard of George Washington and his 
generation, we betray our civic inheritance. Worse, we betray ourselves.

<P>
A PUNITIVE INS, NOT THE REFUGEES, ABUSES POLITICAL ASYLUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR C. HELTON, Arthur C. Helton, a lawyer, is director of the political 
asylum project of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, based in New York 
City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asylum is being abused. So say U.S. immigration officials commenting on a 
recent upsurge of Central Americans crossing the South Texas border. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, asylum is being abused -- not by the individual applicants, but by the 
federal immigration authorities who have neglected and misapplied the asylum 
provisions of the Refugee Act of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The whole process of asylum, from defining its purpose to administering its 
paperwork, has become so twisted and defective that basic reforms are needed. 
Chief among them is removing the administration of asylum from the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
By law, political asylum is granted to people who face threats to life or 
freedom in their home countries. These days, the INS presumes most asylum 
applicants to be economic migrants who are trying to gain a foothold in the 
United States. The INS says that a sharp rise in filings -- more than 86,000 
cases were pending as of last December -- is attributable to aliens using 
asylum to avoid deportation and to obtain permission to work under new 
immigration controls. The largest groups represented in the filings are 
Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Cubans, Guatemalans and Poles. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the increase in asylum filings, the INS is adding new deterrent 
measures to an existing arsenal of policies, including detention and stepped-up 
interceptions at sea. The agency has restricted the travel of asylum applicants 
in South Texas and assigned temporary staff to accelerate decisions in Los 
Angeles and Miami, and itis planning to require that refugees show at the 
outset that they will be granted asylum in order to be permitted to work. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the INS now opposes the issuance of rules that would establish a 
corps of specially trained asylum officers to decide cases. It also proposes to 
abolish a unit in the Justice Department that was created to monitor asylum 
policy and procedures after an incident in 1985 in which a Soviet seaman was 
forcibly returned to his ship by the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The INS misconstrues the problem, and the solutions that it proposes are 
retrogressive and inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
Central Americans flee to the United States for a mix of reasons, including 
political persecution or economic devastation (which itself can be a 
consequence of political repression). Certainly, those who have a "well-founded 
fear of persecution" in their homeland deserve refugee protection. 
</P>
<P>
As Justice Harry A. Blackmun explained in a 1987 Supreme Court decision, the 
implementation of the Refugee Act requires the INS to end its "years of 
seemingly purposeful blindness" to appropriate legal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 30 INS examiners are currently involved in deciding asylum cases 
around the country. These are low-level functionaries who receive little or no 
instruction on asylum; training materials have not been updated since 1983. 
Many worthy refugees are denied protection because of agency ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than deprive refugees of the opportunity to subsist, rather than seek to 
deter them by imposing restrictive or punitive measures, our government should 
invest sufficient resources in the asylum procedure to ensure that claims are 
fairly and expeditiously determined. The proposed asylum officer corps should 
be established immediately. Asylum adjudicators should be qualified 
professionals who are capable of evaluating the merits of cases on humanitarian 
grounds, without regard to the foreign-policy preferences of the State 
Department, which frequently dictate the outcome of cases under current 
procedure. These adjudicators should be trained in refugee law and 
international relations, and they should be deployed in sufficient numbers to 
decide cases within a reasonable period of time. Also, the standards that they 
follow should be published to promote consistent decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
Even more fundamentally, asylum adjudication should be handled by an agency 
other than INS, perhaps a separate office in the Justice Department. The 
law-enforcement mentality of the INS is simply incompatible with the 
humanitarian act of providing asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The current asylum "crisis" is not caused by an increase in the numbers of 
Central Americans coming to the United States. Rather, it results from the 
continuing failure of INS to achieve the humanitarian standards necessary to 
deciding asylum cases. To protect the people who have fled to this country 
seeking a haven from injustice, a new asylum system is crucial.

FOOTNOTES: FALLEN GOLDEN ARCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the scale of rare events, the closing of a McDonald's restaurant ranks up 
there with a solar eclipse or the discovery of a profitable savings and loan in 
Texas. But it does happen. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's on Hill Street near 5th Street in downtown Los Angeles was 
recently shuttered and its Golden Arches removed after subway construction made 
it difficult for customers to reach. The restaurant will reopen once 
construction hassles ease, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a handful that have closed in the last 15 years," said Charles 
Rubner, a company assistant vice president, who notes that a new outlet is 
added about every 17 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The closure of a McDonald's is news in fast-food circles. "That is unusual," 
said Janet Lowder, a Los Angeles restaurant consultant. "People, no matter what 
the obstacle, usually get to a McDonald's."

<P>
Call It Copyopoly 
</P>
<P>
Is there no honor among copycats? 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Chapin thinks Newportopoly -- a Monopoly-inspired board game with Orange 
County business names -- is an unfair rip-off of two games she introduced last 
year, SanDiegOpoly and La JollaOpoly. So she has sent the game's maker, G&amp;L 
Enterprises, a cease and desist letter. 
</P>
<P>
That amuses the attorney for Parker Bros., who thinks all three games may be a 
rip-off of the firm's Monopoly game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the bad guy calling the bad guy a bad guy," said lawyer Steven M. 
Weinberg of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bros. has pursued many similar cases over the years, and it appears its 
work is far from over. G&amp;L and Chapin's company, Citiopoly, are currently 
racing to beat each other to the stores with San Franciscopoly.

<P>
As American as Aussie Pie 
</P>
<P>
The next hot fad from the land of kangaroos and boomerangs may come from the 
microwave. 
</P>
<P>
Four 'n Twenty, the Tustin-based subsidiary of a Australian company, has tried 
to distribute a beef-filled pastry through vending machines and a dozen stores 
in California for more than three years. But sales in some markets have been 
cool as a koala's nose. Why? Among other reasons, people didn't know what it 
was -- and furthermore, there was too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
The firm originally dubbed the product "Aussie Pie" but changed the name 
because studies showed Americans didn't know the difference between a meat pie 
and pot pie. (And probably still don't.) 
</P>
<P>
So for a new, wider launch in California and Nevada next month, the company has 
dubbed its product "Aussie Snacks" and slimmed it down from 6 to 2 ounces. Does 
Crocodile Dundee eat finger food? 
</P>
<P>
DAT Store Isn't Discount 
</P>
<P>
A store in Santa Monica is breaking the sound of silence on DAT. 
</P>
<P>
The latest audio gadget from Japan, digital audio tape recorders give special 
cassette tapes the same superb sound quality as that found on compact discs. 
But DAT's future is clouded. The U.S. recording industry is fighting DAT makers 
on grounds that the players could lead to piracy of compact discs. That, and 
related political problems, have held up distribution in America. 
</P>
<P>
The DAT Store in Santa Monica, however, is betting the technology takes off. 
The only DAT-only store in California -- "and probably the universe," according 
to a salesman -- it sells players for $999 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The store -- which must buy its merchandise in Japan and have it air-freighted 
back -- sells most of its players to such recording artists as Stevie Wonder 
and Stevie Nicks and their studios, according to a salesman. Who else could 
afford it? A single prerecorded tape costs $30 -- more than double the cost of 
an average compact disc -- though the store discounts them to $26 for multiple 
orders.

With the national spotlight fixed on the mounting crisis in the nation's 
savings and loan industry, the calls are growing louder in Washington to 
accelerate the prosecution of those who played significant parts in causing 
hundreds of thrift collapses in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out of the 
(savings and loan) business and they should go to jail," President Bush told 
Congress earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for these failures? Where are they now? Are they going to 
jail? What kinds of sentences are being handed out? 
</P>
<P>
Based on court documents, public records, news reports and interviews, here are 
the stories of five ex-thrift executives whose questionable banking practices 
sparked criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David L. Butler 
</P>
<P>
David L. Butler, erstwhile wonder boy who once owned and operated Bell Savings 
in San Mateo, Calif., is a pale shade of his old self. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000 Jaguar is gone, replaced by a gray Mercury four-door. So is the 
cockiness that accompanied having a net worth of between $70 million and $80 
million at age 31. "I'm broke," he said in an interview last week in a 
Sacramento coffee shop. "I'm zeroed out." 
</P>
<P>
Now 36, Butler is headed to jail next month to serve a two-year term for 
insider bank fraud after pleading guilty to loan fraud and misusing millions of 
dollars of Bell Savings' money. He was also placed on five years' probation and 
must perform 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the severity of the crime, the sentence has angered some law 
enforcement officials. "That's a dumb message: 'Crime pays,' " one regulatory 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, which handled the prosecution, had 
asked for a relatively light three-year sentence on the grounds that Butler had 
cooperated with the government and had made a convincing case that he had 
turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years was less than we would have liked," prosecutor John Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's cooperation with the government led to fraud charges against two 
former business associates, but those charges were eventually dropped when 
prosecutors were unable to corroborate the accusations, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler epitomizes a new breed of bank crook -- sophisticated and well-educated 
-- who lived a prince's life on customers' savings and kept pushing the 
investment rules until he finally broke them. Raised in a middle-class milieu 
in upstate New York and Florida, Butler is a college graduate and former 
navigator in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's interview, he attributed his downfall to good intentions 
gradually gone awry. Sounding matter-of-fact and not overly contrite, Butler 
said the lines between right and wrong blurred as time went on and business 
difficulties mounted. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not see the savings and loan as a way to come in and commit grand 
larceny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he freely admits now that he broke federal banking laws by having Bell 
Savings lend money on development projects in which he had a concealed 
interest. The loans were made on projects that had gotten into trouble, 
including a 14-story high-rise in downtown Sacramento known as One City Centre. 
</P>
<P>
"The long and short of it is, I tried to solve problems on projects in which I 
had an interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler and a business partner bought control of financially ailing Bell 
National, the parent company, in 1982 by putting up nearly $4 million in cash 
and giving Bell ownership of Butler's troubled development company. Butler 
planned to restore the thrift to health by making construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Bell National made money on large loan fees, as much as $13 
million a year. "On paper, it was great," Butler recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He received cash compensation of $668,800 in 1983, and a bonus of $629,434 in 
1984 on top of his monthly salary. His company car was a Jaguar, while the 
other thrift executives and directors drove Mercedeses. One lending official, 
Butler's girlfriend at the time, was given a red Ferrari, according to a 
shareholder lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
But Bell Savings ultimately failed because its construction loans, made mostly 
in Texas and the Silicon Valley, lost more than half their value after the two 
regions were hit hard by economic downturns in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
For all his past problems, Butler is down but not out. He still has a home, 
family and, until recently, a job as general manager of a dental products firm 
near Sacramento. He is mulling the possibility of a book about bank fraud and 
does not appear frightened about spending time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Where does he want to spend his period of incarceration? "I asked for the Hyatt 
Regency," he quipped. "I told them I wouldn't go out of my room." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don Ray Dixon 
</P>
<P>
When historians record the turbulent times of the thrift industry in the 1980s, 
the name of Don Ray Dixon is sure to get prominent mention. 
</P>
<P>
He was arguably the highest of the high-living real estate developers who, 
attracted by vastly expanded investment powers for thrifts, flocked en masse 
into the savings and loan industry early in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon bought control of Vernon Savings, a thrift in north Texas, and used the 
financial institution to finance European junkets and a fabulous life style in 
San Diego. When the thrift was seized by regulators nearly two years ago, 
nearly all its loans were in default. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Vernon's possessions included a corporate jet, a 
Falcon 50; a $2.6-million yacht known as High Spirits; a Ferrari and 
Rolls-Royce dealership in La Jolla; a $1-million home in Solano Beach, and a 
$2-million home in Del Mar, where Dixon lived rent-free. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is now paying for the good times. He has filed for personal bankruptcy, 
been targeted in a $540-million civil fraud suit filed by the government and is 
among dozens of executives under criminal investigation by an FBI and Justice 
Department task force in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Dixon works out of a small office building in Laguna Beach, but 
precisely what he does is something of an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's criminal lawyer in Dallas, William M. Ravkind, says Dixon "was trying 
to make a living being a broker, but I don't even know what he was brokering. 
The bankruptcy pretty much wiped him out." 
</P>
<P>
According to one recent newspaper report, Dixon frequently plays golf at La 
Costa Hotel &amp; Spa resort in San Diego and "dabbles" in off-shore insurance 
companies. Also, according to the report in the Wall Street Journal, he is said 
to have received a target letter from criminal prosecutors in Dallas, 
indicating that he may be indicted soon. 
</P>
<P>
But that report was denied by Dixon's attorneys, who say he has not yet 
received a target letter, is not involved in off-shore insurance and has not 
played golf at La Costa in years. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is traveling in Israel and could not be reached for comment. In the past 
when he has discussed Vernon Savings, he justified the perquisites and life 
style as necessary for a backwater thrift to attract important business. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't access Florida development loans or Southern California construction 
loans by taking a Greyhound bus out of Vernon, Tex." he said in an interview 
with The Times last year. 
</P>
<P>
One notorious company-paid trip to Europe was a whirlwind eating binge at some 
of France's best restaurants that lasted 10 days. The journey was supposedly 
part of a marketing study for a plan to open a fancy restaurant in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
In a 17-page diary of the trip, Dixon's wife, Dana, described the time as a 
"flying house party" and a "gastronomique fantastique." Dixon, however, offered 
a more mundane view of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"You think it's easy eating in three-star restaurants twice a day six days a 
week?" he asked a Chicago Tribune reporter last summer. "By the end of the 
week, you want to spit it (the food) out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Knapp 
</P>
<P>
It has been 54 months since Charles W. (Charlie) Knapp was ousted from his post 
as chairman and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Financial Corp. of 
America, then the nation's largest savings and loan company. 
</P>
<P>
Cushioned by a $2-million severance payment at the time regulators forced him 
to resign, Knapp quickly bounced back from the debacle, forming his own 
merchant banking company in Westwood known as Trafalgar Holdings that now 
dabbles in everything from corporate takeovers to mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
FCA never bounced back, though, nor did its operating subsidiary, American 
Savings &amp; Loan. After years of horrendous losses on Knapp-era real estate 
development loans, American Savings failed last fall and was placed in 
government receivership. Stripped of its only substantive asset, FCA filed for 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
American Savings was later turned over to Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass as 
part of a federally assisted rescue expected to cost at least $1.7 billion -- 
funds that will be paid by the U.S. taxpayer and the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest criticisms of Knapp came in an internal FCA study done in 
1986 that accused his management team of causing loan losses of more than $400 
million. FCA had also deliberately pumped up its earnings and assets "to 
inflate the market price of its stock, all for (Knapp's) own personal financial 
gain and self aggrandizement," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, 54, has argued in court papers and past interviews that he has been made 
a scapegoat for the failings of regulators and the management that succeeded 
him. He could not be reached to comment for this article. 
</P>
<P>
FCA's past lending activities have been the subject of a criminal investigation 
by the FBI for several years, public documents show. But Knapp has not been 
accused of wrongdoing by any government agency, nor is he likely to be, 
according to his attorney, Arthur N. Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The information that I have is that there is no basis for criminal or civil 
actions by the government," Greenberg said. "Nothing was done that was wrong or 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
A regulatory official in California, who asked not to be identified, agreed, 
saying: "I think he'll slide." 
</P>
<P>
But another government official, who also asked to remain anonymous, confirmed 
that a criminal investigation of FCA is continuing, adding that it is 
ultimately going to be up to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles to 
determine what to do with the FBI's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"If something is going to happen," he said, "it will be within the next few 
months." Robert C. Bonner, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
J. William Oldenburg 
</P>
<P>
J. William Oldenburg, one-time owner of the now-defunct Los Angeles Express 
football team, is brokering mortgage loans as usual from his office in the 
Transamerica tower in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But these are hardly usual times for the 50-year-old financier, who faces a 
42-year prison term and $44,000 in fines if convicted on all charges in a bank 
fraud indictment filed last month against him and three former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-count indictment charges them with conspiring to defraud State Savings 
&amp; Loan in Salt Lake City by using $21.5 million in thrift funds toward the 
purchase of an overpriced piece of property he owned in the San Francisco Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg bought the 363-acre property in 1973 for less than $1 million and 
later sold it for many times that amount to State Savings, which he also owned. 
Appraisals on the property exceeded $50 million, but they were "deficient, 
exaggerated and unreliable," the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg could not be reached for comment, but his lawyer, Joseph L. Alioto, 
scoffed at the charges, saying they were handed down simply because the 
five-year statute of limitations was about to run out. "He'll be acquitted for 
sure," said Alioto, who was San Francisco's mayor from 1967 to 1976. "It's a 
phony case." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the indictment is the latest in a series of setbacks for the flamboyant 
Oldenburg, a short, stocky one-time vacuum-cleaner salesman who later billed 
himself as a "self-made billionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg once stunned the sports world by agreeing to give quarterback Steve 
Young a $36-million lifetime contract to play for the Express, which was a part 
of the United States Football League. The team folded in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg built an empire as a mortgage broker who specialized in helping 
thrifts to buy loan participations in residential and commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a recent congressional committee report on bank fraud, 
Oldenburg ended up arranging for thrifts around the nation to participate in 
bad loans. Several of the institutions later failed. Oldenburg was "involved in 
various capacities with a number of insolvent S&amp;Ls," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
State Savings was closed in 1985 after regulators declared the institution 
insolvent in what was at the time one of the most expensive failures in savings 
and loan history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daniel W. Dierdorff 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Sun Savings founder Dan Dierdorff pleaded guilty to illegally 
transferring more than $200,000 in thrift funds to a secret account and forging 
a signature on a $2,000 check. Last Monday, the former varsity wrestler at San 
Diego State College got his punishment from U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades 
-- an eight-year prison term and an order to pay fines and restitution of more 
than $212,000. 
</P>
<P>
The tough sentence completed the downfall of the 52-year-old Dierdorff, a man 
whose plight had sparked widespread support for him among well-known San 
Diegans. Among those who wrote letters on his behalf were San Diego City 
Manager John Lockwood and former San Diego Charger football player Kellen 
Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
One friend, banker Dan McSweeney, characterized Dierdorff as a naive 
businessman who had risen too fast in the thrift world and was "in over his 
head." McSweeney argued that Dierdorff be allowed to perform community service 
chores rather than be forced to spend time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Yesmin Saide, in pre-sentencing arguments, painted a 
far different portrait, calling Dierdorff a "greedy, ruthless, power-hungry man 
driven to fatten his own wallet" through a scheme of loan fraud and kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Dierdorff and opened Oct. 6, 1980, Sun Savings had a short shelf 
life. It was seized by thrift regulators and declared insolvent in July, 1986. 
Dierdorff served as Sun Savings' chief executive and chairman until he resigned 
in late 1984. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Dierdorff received exorbitant salaries for running a 
financial institution that made high-risk and imprudent loans. He was 
"motivated by personal benefit and greed and involved Sun Savings in business 
transactions that were never in the institution's best interest," the 
government said in a pre-sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Dierdorff set up a phony bank account, known as the "Danzer 
account," into which he deposited more than $200,000 in funds that he later 
admitted came from loan kickbacks, court papers show. 
</P>
<P>
To hide the account and conceal the funding source, Dierdorff misled the 
thrift's outside auditors and lied to regulators, saying the money came from 
gambling winnings in Las Vegas. Dierdorff admitted to regulators last summer 
that the money came from bribes or kickbacks on Sun Savings' deals, the 
prosecution said. 
</P>
<P>
"Flat broke," according to his attorney, and in tears before his sentencing, 
Dierdorff told the court that he never intended to "hurt anybody, including Sun 
Savings." Free on $75,000 bond, Dierdorff is expected to enter prison March 27.

The Hartford Insurance Group of Connecticut announced plans to shut down 
clerical operations in Brea in Orange County and Walnut Creek in Northern 
California, effective May 26. It said 205 workers at the two facilities must 
either transfer to operations in other states or lose their jobs. Sixty-five 
employees at a Brea underwriting and service center and 140 employees at a 
Walnut Creek processing center will be affected. The offices will be closed 
because of cost-cutting measures and the increased use of automation.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it had agreed to buy Hachette Group's 50% 
stake in Premier magazine, giving News Corp. complete control of the U.S. 
publication. The price was not disclosed. Premier, a movie magazine, was formed 
18 months ago as a joint venture between News Corp.'s News America Publishing 
Inc. and Hachette Publications Inc., the French group's U.S. arm. Premier's 
circulation is now over 400,000, News Corp. said.

Former Dunes Hotel owner Morris Shenker was indicted for allegedly funneling 
hundreds of thousands of dollars to his children to avoid paying back taxes and 
bankruptcy creditors. A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment 
against the 82-year-old Shenker, who now resides in St. Louis. FBI spokesman 
Tom Nicodemus said Shenker will be issued a summons and will be arraigned on 
the charges in St. Louis. Shenker, who operated the Dunes during the 1970s, has 
been in bankruptcy protection since January, 1984. According to the indictment, 
Shenker allegedly diverted money from a California partnership owned by his 
children to individuals in Canada and back to Shenker's secretary in Las Vegas 
in an elaborate scheme to avoid his creditors.

The American Iron and Steel Institute said steel imports declined 16% in 
December from a year earlier to 1.42 million tons, but imports for all of 1988 
rose 4.9% to 20.89 million tons. Despite climbing from 19.92 million tons in 
1987, imports last year represented a smaller share of the U.S. market, down to 
20.3% from 20.9%. December's imports represented 18.4% of the market, down from 
19.7% in December, 1987, when 1.69 million tons of steel entered the country. 
The market penetration in November, 1988, was 19.7%, or 1.85 million tons.

A Boeing subsidiary may have curtailed testing of high-tech nuts and bolts 
destined for use in the new Air Force B-2 stealth bomber in order to save 
money, according to a published report Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation, suspected of 
supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a fictitious "Inspector 11." 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Times reported that an internal memo declared that Boeing Advanced 
Systems had the testing of incoming fasteners curtailed just as a federal task 
force began an investigation into fraud in the aerospace fastener industry. 
Only "suspect" parts would be tested, the memo stated. 
</P>
<P>
Among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by Boeing were high-tech 
titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a Chatsworth company called Voi-Shan, a 
division of Fairchild Industries, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Titanium Fasteners 
</P>
<P>
Boeing Advanced Systems in Seattle uses Voi-Shan nuts and bolts. Boeing is 
manufacturing classified parts for the Stealth bomber, made by Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 20 federal agents armed with search warrants seized 52 crates of 
documents, test equipment and fasteners in a raid on Voi-Shan, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The agents were searching for evidence to support allegations made by three 
past and present Voi-Shan workers that no testing was done on the fasteners, 
but the fasteners were given approved by a fictitious "Inspector 11." 
</P>
<P>
The Times said tests done on high-performance titanium fasteners, used to hold 
together everything from engines to airframes, were of particular concern. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also obtained Boeing and Voi-Shan shipping documents that stated 
in the week before the raid Boeing Advanced Systems received two shipments of 
more than 200 Voi-Shan titanium fasteners, with test reports certified by 
"Inspector 11." 
</P>
<P>
The Times, quoting an unidentified source, said those parts were only two of 
many similar shipments designated for the B-2 project last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Feb. 18, 1988, memo obtained by the newspaper, a quality-control 
manager at Boeing Advanced Systems ordered the routine testing of incoming 
shipments of some fasteners stopped, apparently to save money. 
</P>
<P>
The memo said the company expected to save $53,000 by reducing testing from 
March to October last year. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder confirmed that the memo was legitimate, but 
declined further comment on it or the B-2 program.

INVESTMENT BANKERS SURGE FROM DOWN UNDER TO DO TAKEOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With little fanfare, Australian companies came, saw and acquired U.S. firms at 
an accelerating pace between 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, this quiet invasion may have been officially signalled when an 
Australian investment bank called Capel Court Pacific established U.S. 
operations by planting its corporate flag in Los Angeles. Indeed, the presence 
of Capel Court is a sign of the times: Increasingly, firms from "Down Under" 
are aiming to take over. 
</P>
<P>
Capel Court, which provides Australian firms with acquisition strategies, 
became the first Australian investment banker to establish a U.S. presence when 
it opened the Los Angeles office in November, 1986. The firm -- it's part of an 
Australian conglomerate called Capel Court Group -- recently sent a corporate 
director to manage the office, a move designed to bolster the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The presence and the upgrading of an Aussie investment bank in the United 
States was an important development in business relations between Australia and 
the United States, according to Denis Hardiman, president of the Australian 
American Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very significant thing," said Hardiman, a senior vice president 
at the Los Angeles offices of the Melbourne-based National Australia Bank. "To 
me, it suggests there will be heavier investment." 
</P>
<P>
Capel Court's presence is a sign of the expanding role of Australian companies 
in the world economy, according to Julie Bayliss, a commissioner at the Los 
Angeles-based Australian Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Development 
</P>
<P>
During the first and second year of its operation in the United States -- 1987 
and 1988 -- Capel Court helped arrange six deals, transactions totaling about 
$500 million. For example, it helped the Sydney-based QBE Insurance acquire 
Sequoia Insurance Co., a Menlo Park, Calif.-based property and casualty insurer 
in 1987. One of its larger deals -- Sydney-based Paul Ramsey Group's 1987 
acquisition of Health Care Services of America, a Birmingham, Ala.-based 
hospital chain -- involved about $130 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the Australian investment community is casting farther afield," 
Bayliss said. "It's a sign of the growth and development of Australian 
companies and evidence of the importance of overseas markets." 
</P>
<P>
This expansion was prompted partly by the Australian government, which 
concluded that Australian companies could only continue to grow by boosting 
exports and by acquiring other firms, according to Gerald H. Watkins, senior 
commissioner at the Australian Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The government early this decade encouraged acquisitions because some 
Australian export products can obtain only small shares of certain foreign 
markets, Watkins said. Some markets have high tariffs or other trade barriers, 
and other markets -- like those in the United States -- are already saturated 
with a large supply of competitively priced products, Watkins said. "Australian 
firms . . . quickly outgrow the domestic (Australian) market of 16 million 
people, and the U.S. -- with a free and open market -- is very attractive," 
Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Australian firms responded by investing $10.5 billion in the United States 
between 1981 and 1986 -- much to the glee of U.S. investment bankers who 
collected large fees for preparing takeover strategies and arranging financing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comfortable With Area 
</P>
<P>
Capel Court executives monitored the spree and decided it was their turn to 
respond, according to David McDougall, the Capel Court Group director now 
overseeing operations at the Los Angeles office. Top executives at Capel Court 
Group decided to establish a U.S. presence to develop a special relationship 
with acquisition-minded Aussies, McDougall said. 
</P>
<P>
Capel Court opted for a Los Angeles office because Southern California is a 
major financial center and for geographic reasons, McDougall said. California 
is the first scheduled stop for many executives departing Australia en route to 
various destinations in the United States. Culturally, Australians are more 
comfortable in sunny, ocean-rimmed environments where people are relatively 
informal -- characteristics of California, according to McDougall. 
</P>
<P>
"Management saw it as an opportunity to create for Capel Court a niche that no 
other investment bank had," McDougall said. It was an opportunity to get in on 
the ground floor because we could see significant investment and we wanted to 
be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
As Capel Court expected, the pace of activity has accelerated. Australian firms 
spent at least $2.4 billion -- about 35% of their total foreign investment -- 
on just corporate mergers and acquisitions in the United States in 1987. The 
tally excludes real estate deals and investments in stocks and bonds. That 
investment level surpassed the $1.5 billion -- again, excluding investments in 
land and the money market -- in reported merger and acquisition spending by the 
Japanese in the United States in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese firms surged ahead of the Australians in 1988, investing a whopping 
$11.9 billion for mergers and acquisitions in the United States. Still, 
Australian spending more than doubled -- reaching $5.4 billion in 1988. In 
contrast, Australian firms invested only about $305 million for the 12 months 
ending in July, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the stakes are higher, Capel Court actually stimulates the process by 
proposing matches or takeover targets for Australian companies. The firm helps 
with negotiations and is willing to find financial backers. Recently, 
Australians have tended to invest more heavily in the states of Georgia, New 
York, Texas and California, according to McDougall. Statistics show they often 
invest in manufacturing, mining and in companies involved in construction and 
the production of building materials. 
</P>
<P>
There have been blockbuster transactions. Two of the more publicized big deals 
involved News Corp. Ltd., which acquired Metromedia Inc. for $1.5 billion and 
20th Century Fox for $575 million -- both in 1985. There was also Bond Group's 
acquisition of G. Heileman Brewing Co. for $1.2 billion and BHP Co.'s purchase 
of Monsanto Oil Co. for $745 million -- both in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, Australian companies tend to acquire small-to-medium-sized firms. For 
example, 86% of the Australian acquisitions in the United States in 1987 were 
for less than $100 million, according to Capel Court. About 71% of the 1988 
Australian deals in the United States were for under $100 million. In contrast, 
only 44% of the Japanese acquisitions in the United States were for less than 
$100 million in 1988, according to Capel Court. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many Australian acquisitions involve smaller operations, they often 
go unheralded, according to James Reno, vice president at Capel Court Pacific. 
Reno, an American who joined Capel Court in 1987, said Capel Court is 
positioned primarily to help Australian firms interested in acquiring 
medium-sized U.S. firms. "There are a lot of middle market firms -- companies 
worth between $20 million to $200 million -- in the U.S.," Reno said. "I think 
that's where you see the best opportunities. That's where you find the best 
undervalued operations."

GUTFREUND DENIES PLANS FOR BUYOUT; 
</P>
<P>
SALOMON CHAIRMAN SAYS TROUBLES ARE OVER

<P>
Salomon Inc. Chairman John Gutfreund says the big Wall Street investment bank 
is well on the road to recovery from its recent troubles, and denies Wall 
Street rumors that it is contemplating a leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
In a turbulent recent history, the firm's earnings have declined steeply since 
their peak in 1986 and it has seen the departure of a number of key executives, 
the layoff of about 1,000 employees and an unwanted investment by corporate 
raider Ronald O. Perelman. 
</P>
<P>
Some on Wall Street have speculated that the company will shield itself from 
further troubles by going private in a leveraged buyout. But Gutfreund, in an 
interview with Reuters at his desk overlooking the firm's huge bond trading 
room, said no such buyout is contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
"Not at this time," Gutfreund said, adding that Salomon has not considered it 
in the past. Instead, he extolled the merits of the firm's recovery plan and 
gave a bullish outlook for the embattled firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We're well positioned if market activity remains reasonably good," said 
Gutfreund, a balding man with horn-rimmed glasses who made his reputation as a 
no-nonsense bond trader. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon last week reported a fourth-quarter loss of $38 million, including a 
one-time charge of $180 million. But for the year as a whole, it reported a 
profit of $280 million, double 1987's $142 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Analysts Skeptical 
</P>
<P>
But the one-time premier Wall Street investment banking house, with a legendary 
reputation for its stock and bond trading, remains well below its peak 1986 
earnings of $516 million. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts remain skeptical whether the firm, which has suffered from 
high-level personnel defections, will be able to pull off a spectacular 
turnaround in earnings. Even the recent improvement was derived largely from 
the strength of its energy division, not its investment banking. 
</P>
<P>
But they give Salomon good marks for cutting costs to correct an overexpansion 
of the firm in the midst of the bull market. Salomon withdrew from some 
businesses and trimmed staff levels just before the October, 1987, stock market 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had to cut back on some of our businesses, reallocate personnel 
because we didn't want to grow. We were 7,000 people. We're back down to about 
6,000. Strangely enough, with all the problems I'm as optimistic as I've been 
in a couple of years," Gutfreund said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutfreund also said the firm is undergoing its first major budgeting study, 
being conducted by chief financial officer Donald Howard. He said he expects no 
more staff cuts as a result of the study, but it may result in some 
reallocations. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring also considered asset sales, although Gutfreund said the firm 
has no specific sales targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Even though its past cutbacks have hit foreign operations, Gutfreund sees 
continuing growth in Europe and Asia is a major goal for Salomon as an 
international stock and bond dealer. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology is driving the business so hard, you really can't as a major 
institution say 'I'm going to be in America, I'm going to be in Europe, or I'm 
going to be in Asia.' The linkages now are inextricable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks to Grab Share 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes the firm can expand its "junk bond" business, possibly gaining 
ground from its towering rival in that business, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., 
whose insider trading scandal troubles of the past two years make Salomon's 
woes seem slight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to pick up some of that share. . . . Through all their travails, they 
have done very well maintaining market share. The only way we can improve as 
well as the rest of the competition is if we provide better service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the firm's efforts to expand in merchant banking, in which 
stockbrokers take part as investors in takeovers. Most recently Salomon joined 
in a failed effort with a group of investors in vying to take over RJR Nabisco 
Inc., which was won by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts remain mixed about this and other parts of the Salomon recovery. Larry 
Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said: "It's going to have be a 
wait and see situation. The firm has gone through a lot of strategic refocusing 
which has yet to pay dividends. Their earnings continue to be going so-so. 
There's been changes and talk but no real results you can hang your hat on." 
</P>
<P>
Gutfreund said he sees no takeover threat from Warren Buffet, who bought a 
$700-million, 14.5% stake as a friendly investor and Perelman, chairman of 
Revlon Inc., who said he would buy up to 25% of the firm when he was refused 
the chance to strike a deal like Buffett received. 
</P>
<P>
Gutfreund said he believes that Perelman is no longer interested in building a 
position in Salomon stock. Revlon Inc. had no comment and it could not be 
determined how many, if any, Salomon shares he bought. Perelman was perceived 
as a hostile threat after Salomon declined to sell him a 14% stake that was 
available in 1987.

BETTER KNOWN FO HOLLYWOOD AND BEACHES, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ALSO CONSIDERED 
THE WHITE COLLAR CROME CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Drugs, gangs and drive-by shooting may grab the headlines, but the most serious 
crime problem in the Los Angeles area, according to law enforcement officials, 
is white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal investigators say white-collar crime in Los Angeles has been 
on a rapid rise throughout the 1980s, giving the Southland the dubious 
distinction of being dubbed the fraud capital of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we are," says U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner, one of the most visible 
and vocal officials in a veritable army of white-collar crime fighters in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bonner, Los Angeles has "a greater number of fraud cases and in 
larger dollar amounts than any other district in the country, by far. In just 
about every area except the Wall Street insider trading cases we have a more 
significant problem -- in terms of losses to investors, financial institutions 
and government -- than New York." 
</P>
<P>
Just three weeks ago, U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced the formation 
of a national task force of six U.S. Attorney's offices, including Los Angeles, 
to intensify the fight against securities and commodity fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every state and federal law enforcement and regulatory agency in 
Southern California is engaged in the battle. The FBI is involved, along with 
local police and sheriff's departments. But there are also agencies involved 
here such as the Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, 
Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodities 
Futures Trading Commission and Environmental Protection Agency. There's even a 
federal agency that looks for nothing but defense industry fraud and a county 
agency watching only for consumer rip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Definition of Category 
</P>
<P>
The offices of the state attorney general, the district attorney and the U.S. 
attorney each have their own units specializing in major fraud. All say their 
investigators and prosecutors are swamped with work. 
</P>
<P>
Also called business or economic crime, white-collar crime is defined by one 
government prosecutor as "when a business person -- usually through their 
affiliations with companies -- makes money illegally through fraud, 
embezzlement, stock manipulation, tax or antitrust violations." Thornburgh 
recently labeled it "crime in the executive suites." 
</P>
<P>
Why is Southern California such a hotbed of white-collar crime? 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that it's due in part to the fact that law enforcement staffs have 
not been growing in proportion to the population, so it's easier to do things 
here and get away with it," said Irving M. Einhorn, regional administrator for 
the SEC. "In Chicago, you see police cars on the street in numbers that would 
shock someone who's lived here all their lives. Law enforcement presence is not 
as evident here." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason, Einhorn believes, has to do with the nature of Los Angeles 
itself. "You have a huge transient population and a thriving entrepreneurial 
spirit here, so no one thinks anything of a new business opening up. You simply 
rent an office, give a few dollars to charity, get some publicity and all of a 
sudden you're an accepted part of the business community. That's not as easily 
done in Cincinnati. It's a curiousity to me." 
</P>
<P>
The current white-collar crime wave in Los Angeles runs the gamut from 
multimillion-dollar bank and securities frauds, such as the ZZZZ Best Carpet 
Cleaning case, to usually unreported incidents of consumers being overcharged 
on auto repairs or being deliberately short-changed at a retail checkout 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many More Complaints 
</P>
<P>
In between are a myriad of defense procurement, investor and bankruptcy frauds, 
environmental crimes and crimes by computer. All are on the upswing, according 
to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago we received about 1,000 complaints of bank fraud in Los 
Angeles," said Bill Stollhans, the assistant special agent in charge of the 
FBI's white-collar criminal investigations unit here. "Now we're getting 
between 6,000 and 7,000 complaints a year." And the dollar amounts of the 
frauds have increased dramatically as well, Stollhans said. "In the early 
1980s, a $100,000 bank fraud was considered a very good case. Now a big case is 
eight digits. We have many between $20 million and $60 million." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly then, the Los Angeles office of the FBI ranks white-collar 
crime as its highest priority, with bank fraud and defense procurement fraud 
accounting for 60% of its agents' efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is aided in its battle against defense fraud by the Defense Criminal 
Investigative Service, an agency created by the Defense Department in 1982 
specifically to investigate corruption in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
The DCIS office in Laguna Niguel is the largest and busiest in the country, 
said Rodney Hansen, the special agent in charge. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hansen, in just the last few years in the Southern California 
region, DCIS investigations have led to 97 indictments and recovered more than 
$50 million for the government. "We could double our staff and still have an 
overwhelming amount of work to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Regard for Safety 
</P>
<P>
The DCIS' top priority is a trend among unscrupulous defense contractors toward 
"product substitution," the use of inferior components in the construction of 
military aircraft or weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of cases, the contract calls for the testing of parts, and some 
contractors are doing things like using an inferior grade of steel to increase 
their profit margins and then falsifying the testing," Hansen said. "This is 
greed to the point where they are abandoning any regard for user safety." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 2 priority of Hansen's agency is kickbacks and bribery. "In the last 
couple of years in Los Angeles we've had 30 indictments of buyers for 
corporations who received kickbacks from vendors in return for awarding a 
contract," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
Bank fraud and defense procurement fraud have the the broadest impact on 
society at large, at least in terms of cost, law enforcement officials say, but 
investor fraud can have the most devastating effect on individual victims. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no single location comes up more often in discussions of the 
white-collar crime problem than Newport Beach in Orange County. In recent 
years, according to state and federal officials, the Newport Beach area has 
become the center of investor scam operations, so-called boiler rooms where 
high-pressure con artists use banks of telephones to push bogus investment 
plans to targeted retired or elderly victims. 
</P>
<P>
And why Newport Beach? "Simply because its sounds classier over the phone than, 
say, Pomona," one investigator said. 
</P>
<P>
Fraud investigators relate countless horror stories of gullible retirees who 
were persuaded over the telephone to put their life savings in such flaky 
investments as discounted precious metals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Hefty Losses 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 21 years and I've never seen a problem as bad as the boiler 
room situation is today," said Wes Fisk, and investigator for the California 
Department of Corporations. "Written complaints coming into our office have 
tripled in the last three years, up to 9,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fisk, the average victim of a boiler room scheme loses between 
$40,000 and $50,000. "And I know of one victim who invested $400,000 on a 
single telephone call." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon to find boiler rooms where the gross take is between $2 
million and $3 million a month," he said. "I don't know of anything that has 
that kind of return except narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
Although white-collar crime traditionally has been nonviolent, that may be 
changing, according to Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
"We're we're finding more and more organized crime moving into boiler rooms, 
and we've had two incidents of violent acts," he said. "One group tried to run 
off a competitor with a crossbow, and when that didn't work, they shot him with 
a .45 twice in chest and once in the head." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gary Fees, head of the major frauds division of the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, his unit has successfully prosecuted more 
than 300 individuals in boiler room cases in the last three years -- and there 
are still several hundred operations currently doing business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Kinds of Crime 
</P>
<P>
Fees ticked off a long list of other white-collar crimes that are currently 
thriving in the Los Angeles area: 
</P>
<P>
"Real estate fraud. Insurance fraud is a big business here. We have a serious 
staged-accident problem. Arson-related insurance fraud is one of the most 
difficult crimes to deal with -- something like 90% of the cases result in no 
charges being filed because it's such a tough crime to prove. We have a lot of 
Medicare and Medicaid fraud." 
</P>
<P>
With a staff of 14 prosecutors, the major fraud division of the Los Angeles 
District Attorney's Office handles about 120 white-collar crime cases a year, 
according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Allen D. Field, who heads the unit. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases can be a nightmare to prosecute because they require a great deal 
of investigative time, involve boxes and boxes of complex documents and the 
normal defense tactic is to keep asking for trial continuances, thinking the 
victims, witnesses and prosecutors will eventually get tired and give up," 
Field said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem law enforcement faces in battling white-collar crime is the 
relative lack of a deterrent factor, according to Field. "Under state law, the 
maximum time anyone spends in custody on these cases is 5 1/2 years, no matter 
how much money they steal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The federal response to white-collar crime has also, at least until recently, 
needed fortification, according to U.S. Atty. Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
But Bonner said he recently obtained approval from the Justice Department to 
hire 24 new prosecutors, a 15% increase. 
</P>
<P>
"The common denominator in all this white-collar crime is that there has been a 
deterioration in business ethics and our ethical values in general," he said. 
"Because of the growth of Los Angeles, we are reaping the results of that 
erosion."

ON YOUR OWN: STRIKING A BLOW FOR BETTER ROMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD HALPERN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Person A: "Do you love me?" 
</P>
<P>
Person B: "I'm here, aren't I?" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes I try to imagine what would happen if people who received this 
evasive non-reply began to pour cold water over the person who gave them such a 
stingy response, in a simultaneous, worldwide demonstration of unity. What a 
revolution for romance! What a blow for better communication! I can enjoy the 
fantasy, but I cannot advocate such mayhem and certainly could not guarantee a 
happy outcome from this rebellion. However, it is important for people who 
subsist on this meager diet of verbal affection to let the other person know 
that "I'm here, aren't I?" is simply not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Men usually have a tougher time communicating emotions and their more tender 
feelings. But the problem is certainly not restricted to men. In one scene 
during the Broadway musical "Fiddler on the Roof," Tevye begins to think about 
his relationship with his wife, Goldie. They sing a wonderful duet. Tevye 
starts by asking Goldie "Do you love me?" She looks at him as if he is crazy 
and proceeds to list everything she has done for him over the years -- she has 
cooked for him, cleaned for him and borne his children. He continues to ask her 
"But, do you love me?" 
</P>
<P>
A person who finds it hard to say "I love you" may ask "Why is it important? 
I'm there, I do things for her and with her -- can't she tell?" Not 
necessarily. He should be asking himself, "Why do I find it so difficult to say 
'I love you' straight out?" 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious possibility is that he does not love the other person. If that 
is true, then his answer is an evasion, which is what the person asking the 
question fears. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that the person who gives a stingy reply may view 
relationships between the sexes as power struggles. He or she may think that 
saying "I love you" weakens his or her position and gives more power to the 
other person. 
</P>
<P>
You may be involved with someone who is verbally withholding. There may still 
be hope for your relationship. If he or she shows caring feelings by being 
loyal, supportive, protective and remembering what pleases you, then you may 
start to feel OK when you hear "I'm here, aren't I?" and understand that it is 
the best your partner can do. 
</P>
<P>
But before you remain in a relationship with a person who cannot give you more 
open expressions of affection, you must ask yourself, "If this never changes, 
is it all right with me?" If it is not all right you may put yourself in a 
state of chronic frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Does this mean you should abandon your attempts to let the other person know 
how important it is for him or her to express his or her love in words? No. If 
you assume the other person loves you, he or she may be trainable. Look at 
"Fiddler on the Roof." After Tevye persists and explains to Goldie why he wants 
to know if she loves him, she reviews all they have been through together and 
concedes that after 25 years she guesses she loves him. "After 25 years," he 
sings contentedly, "it's good to know." 
</P>
<P>
But it would be nice not to have to wait that long, wouldn't it?

A MEAN-SPIRITED LOOK AT LOSERS, MORONS AND LUST

A Woman's Guide to Adultery by Carol Clewlow (Poseidon Press: $17.95. 224 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
The other day at a business lunch for writers, a middle-aged man, forgetting 
there were two women present, remarked with a cheery smile, "Well, at least we 
don't have women's liberation to worry about anymore. That's ancient history!" 
</P>
<P>
"A Woman's Guide to Adultery" proceeds off that assumption, which gives rise to 
a passel of other assumptions: That men are in the driver's seat, that sex for 
men is fun, that sex for women means suffering, that it's a hard world for 
women, etc., etc., etc. And -- if you're 23 and prefer to go out with married 
men; if you prefer to complain about mean men while you're getting your 
manicure, this is definitely your kind of book. If you're anybody else, this 
book is as strange as if a lady who ate spaghetti three times a day and gained 
weight then wrote a furious book denouncing spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
"A Woman's Guide to Adultery" is a book about four women friends who only fool 
around with (excuse me, fall in love with) married men. "Let's face it," one of 
them says, "given my age and the unavailability of single men, not to mention 
their inferior quality, I really have no choice. If I want sex, and I do, I 
have to accept that the men will be married." 
</P>
<P>
Each to her own taste, of course, but in this book, the fact that "good" women 
are forced to love married men is presented with the same unquestioning belief 
as, for instance, that communism is bad and flossing your teeth is good. As far 
as the author is concerned, the only men worth loving are married. She's 
serious about this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
But He Loves Another 
</P>
<P>
What you get, then, is an elaborate score card of characters: Jennifer loves 
David, a disagreeable poet. Jo loves Martin, a Socialist Party hack. Helen 
loves Ray, a businessman. And Rose (our heroine) loves Paul, a generic academic 
charmer who grazes happily among his female students (seven girlfriends in nine 
years of marriage; but who's counting?). The trouble is: David is living with 
Francie, his high school sweetheart. Martin is married to Margaret, who has let 
her perm grow out and has three kids. Ray is married to Sandra, a beautiful 
woman who has big breasts and dresses in bright clothes. And Paul is married to 
Monica, whom he says he loves. OK? 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, Rose has ethics. (The subtitle of this book, which we only see 
on the back, because it won't sell copies), is "Thinking About Monica," and 
Rose thinks a lot about Monica. Rose only lives by one commandment, she tells 
the reader at one point. Thou shalt not hurt another woman. But Rose starts 
breaking that commandment in a big way because the sex is so Hemingway-esque 
(see Page 122 for flossy sex from before the days of women's liberation). Rose 
doesn't want to hurt Monica, but she does because she just can't help herself. 
And, toward the end of the novel, as Paul is brushing Rose off, she tells a 
girlfriend: "And now I'm shocked to the core that he doesn't love me. . . . He 
thought we were both just in it for a good time. Love was never on the agenda." 
(Well, isn't that just the way it is, girls?! Pass the Danish pastry and the 
steam curlers, make abortion a crime again, and let's have a gab fest! Men are 
beasts and women were made to suffer!) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Separate Parts 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, such a mindset makes for very peculiar writing. The book has 
those two titles, and two very separate parts. The first half is viciously 
against women: Helen, Jo and particularly Jennifer are painted here as a 
species far lower than toads. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the second half here, the men -- Martin, Ray, David and Paul -- are 
also painted as a species far lower than toads. The men made those girls do it. 
Don't you see? They victimized their wives and mistresses with their low 
desires and their devious ways. Everything gets blamed on them, including a bad 
case of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
I have two things to say about this. One is to "other women," whatever their 
walk of life. Fooling around with married men is asking for trouble, whether 
"women's liberation" is in effect or not. Second, this book may serve as a 
harsh reminder of what the war between the sexes was like before what we call 
"women's liberation" came into effect. Is that really what we want again? Men 
seen as snuffling wart hogs and women as drooling morons? 
</P>
<P>
Clewlow can write very good sentences, but her thought processes are 
mean-spirited at best, and, at worst, schizophrenic.

<P>
LOVING RE-CREATION OF 'BLUE DAHLIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pacific Theatre Ensemble has carved out a genre for itself: a kind of 
meticulous reproduction of period pieces, from the only partially successful 
"Romanoff's" to the more distinguished Victorian gothic "Slaughterhouse on 
Tanner's Close." Its latest effort, at the attractive Court Theatre on La 
Cienega Boulevard (which seems the ideal '40s setting for this piece), is a 
stage version of the 1946 movie, "The Blue Dahlia," produced by John Houseman 
and written by Raymond Chandler from his own unfinished novel. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, it's director Daniel O'Connor, responsible for "Tanner's Close," 
who gives this adaptation fidelity, breadth and bustle -- a fluidity that ebbs 
and flows like film, but punctuated by the Blue Dahlia nightclub's latest 
sensation: a torch singer (the sensational Christine Ebersole) with a 
repertoire of top '40s songs used here to securely anchor the action to the 
stage in a manner that would never happen in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
The story is virtually untampered Chandler, with a script that sticks closely 
to the film that featured Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake and good old William Bendix. 
It's the tale of a Navy flyer who, at war's end, comes home to an unfaithful 
wife and is caught in a web of murder and deceit from which, "neither tarnished 
nor afraid," he eventually emerges vindicated after many "mean streets" 
machinations and a panoramic sense of a still pubescent Los Angeles full of 
innocence and stock footage. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the story lacks plot distinction (a fascinating account of the 
improbable making of the film may be found in Houseman's book, "Entertainers 
and the Entertained"). But nostalgia for the Chandleresque, for the halcyon Los 
Angeles that was, add up to iconography -- a preoccupation with the piece as an 
image of its time, much enhanced by the devotion and fidelity of the bright 
younger generation that comprises this talented cast. 
</P>
<P>
There are 41 characters in O'Connor's adaptation, performed by half as many 
quick-change artists who never let the tempo flag. Repetitive moments written 
into the original screenplay hit the stage version in its second half, but 
these are barely felt in the uninterrupted flow of action, with smoking guns, 
sultry women, skulking hoods and characters swirling about the stage as 
continual window dressing: "extras" fleshing out this play with the trappings 
and tradition of film. 
</P>
<P>
It is skillfully done, with respect and even with adoration. The ensemble is 
remarkable in its abilities to do several things at once, while the leads are 
valiantly undertaken by Ramy Zada as Navy flyer Johnny Morrison; Steven J. 
Markus and Ross Hindley as his squadron buddies Buzz and George, respectively; 
Jeffrey Josephson as the sinister Eddie Harwood, owner of the Blue Dahlia 
nightclub; Marcia Firesten as Eddie's estranged wife; and, to a lesser extent, 
Jill Jacobson who seems to be forcing her role as the faithless Helen Morrison. 
(Jacobson and Markus also produced the show.) 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Buderwitz's two-level set is crammed with accurate detail, from the 
prominent jukebox (that looks swiped from the movie), to the old-style pay 
phone on the wall, the antique Coke machine, period posters and old-time radio. 
Lori Martin's costumes are equally impeccable, from the guys' broad-brimmed 
Borsalinos, wide lapels and affection for Hawaiian shirts, to the women's hair 
styles, shoes and gowns. Ebersole's gifted crooning, Toni Destefanis' staging 
of jitterbugging couples and William Maloney's musical arrangements will bring 
a lump to the throat of anyone over 50. 
</P>
<P>
This said, there remains a philosophical question. As with "Tanner's Close" or, 
for that matter, "Romanoff's," does such loving reproduction amount to anything 
more than a piece of affectionate recreation? A valentine to the memory of 
Raymond Chandler and, beyond him, to an entire and specific Hollywood era? The 
answer is no. "The Blue Dahlia" must be admired and enjoyed within these 
limitations. But taken at face value, strictly for what it is, it can be great 
fun and splendid entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 At 722 N. La Cienega Blvd. Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 2:30 
and 7:30 p.m., until April 23. Tickets: $20; (213) 466-1767.

Rock star Jon Bon Jovi told students at a Raleigh, N.C., high school on Friday 
not to let peer pressure or parental harassment push them into drug abuse. Bon 
Jovi, who lapsed into four-letter words a few times while addressing the 2,500 
teen-agers at Broughton High, told them not to ruin their dreams by using 
drugs. He also took a potshot at parents who "come home after three or four 
martinis" and give their kids grief. The rally was staged by Make a Difference 
Foundation, an organization formed by Bon Jovi's manager, Doc McGhee, who 
earlier this year pleaded guilty to helping smuggle 18.5 tons of marijuana from 
Colombia to North Carolina. SHAUNA SNOW

Members of the Baltimore Symphony orchestra return to the concert hall this 
week after ending the longest strike in American symphony history. After 84 
canceled concerts during the 22-week walkout, the orchestra will return to its 
home at Meyerhoff Hall for a performance Thursday. Orchestra members ratified a 
contract that assures them a minimum $1,040 a week in the 1991-1992 season. By 
the end of the four-year, $4.6-million contract, players will earn 35% more 
than the $770 weekly minimum they received at the end of the three-year pact 
that expired in September. Unlike many orchestras, the musicians in the 
Baltimore Symphony are paid for a 52-week year. The contract was approved late 
Saturday by a vote of 78-7; members of the orchestra board had approved it on 
Friday. "We think it's an excellent settlement and it meets the players' needs 
for parity with the orchestras of St. Louis and Cincinnati," said Charles 
Underwood, the players' representative in negotiations. He referred to the 
musicians' demand that their wages be on a par with those of orchestras they 
consider equals. "Hopefully, we'll be able to face the future and become a 
better and deeper institution," said John Gidwitz, the orchestra's executive 
director, who added that ticket prices may go up "modestly." SHAUNA SNOW

Christie's auction house in London has held its first-ever sale of Spanish 
paintings, with a lighthearted "picture within a picture" (Raimundo de Madrazo 
y Garreta's "En El Estudio") fetching the highest individual price of $233,000. 
The 170 paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries reaped a total of $2.1 
million on Friday, with prices "well beyond expectations," said a Christie's 
statement. SHAUNA SNOW

With a pin in his left shoulder and his arm in a sling, actor James Caan, 48, 
strolled out of Santa Monica's St. Johns Hospital and Medical Center on Friday, 
nearly a week after crashing his motorcycle. Doctors had operated to insert a 
pin in his left shoulder Wednesday. . . . Also released from the hospital on 
Friday was jazz musician Dave Brubeck, 68, who had undergone triple-bypass 
heart surgery 10 days earlier in Connecticut's Yale-New Haven Hospital. SHAUNA

The 59 Soviet ballet dancers stranded in Baltimore for two weeks after their 
U.S. producers ran out of money and their nationwide tour was canceled, 
performed in North Branch, N.J. on Sunday and were also scheduled to perform in 
Washington at the end of the month, following a last-minute booking in New York 
this week. The dancers, from the Donetsk State Opera and Ballet Theatre of the 
Ukraine, have been staying in Baltimore while New York producers and the Howard 
Gilman Foundation have tried to arrange a new tour. Meanwhile, Mikhail 
Baryshnikov, artistic director of the American Ballet Theater and a director of 
the Gilman foundation, has offered the dancers scenery, costumes and rehearsal 
space, the Associated Press has reported. The company is now scheduled to 
appear from Wednesday through Saturday at New York's City Center Theater, and 
to dance seven performances in Washington's National Theater, from Feb. 28 to 
March 5. SHAUNA SNOW

POP CAPSULES: DARK ANGEL OFFERS LESSON IN ENDURANCE

Thrash and speed metal, like any other musical form, has its lesser gods -- 
bands that don't have the brutal artistry of Metallica or the fire and sarcasm 
of Slayer, but who have enough power to give their fans a hefty dose of 
sweating and slamming. Dark Angel is one such group. The L.A. quintet goes for 
pure heaviness, and its show Saturday at Fender's gave the packed audience a 
lesson in endurance. The hour-plus speedfest went on relentlessly until the 
club's glass doors were fogged over by the oppressive heat. 
</P>
<P>
With its machine-gun drumming, cacophony of guitars and vocals that sounded 
like a 78 r.p.m. rap, Dark Angel will probably never find mass appeal. But that 
seems to matter little to the group, whose latest album, "Leave Scars," 
willingly sacrifices melody to crushing rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Second-slotted Dr. Know, on the other hand, emphasized its melodic 
sensibilities, which at times diminished its power. The band's time changes 
lacked the dynamics that make thrash's left-hook punch so effective. Some tunes 
had a good, bluesy feel, but this group isn't yet strong enough to blend its 
multiple elements. JANISS GARZA

POP CAPSULES: PLEASURE BARONS GIVE FANS 3 HOURS OF PLEASURABLE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANISS GARZA and CHRIS WILLMAN

<P>
The Pleasure Barons are no robber barons. Fans on hand Friday at the Palomino 
got their money's worth and then some from the 13-piece aggregate formed and 
fronted by local lights Dave Alvin, Mojo Nixon and Country Dick Montana. With 
more than three hours of well-rehearsed music, "leave 'em wanting more" was not 
the operating maxim. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin is one of Los Angeles' best songwriters, and this big band pushed him 
through barnstorm renditions of favorites like "Marie Marie" (from his Blasters 
years) and "4th of July" (from his X stint). The evening's tone, however, was 
set by Montana (on leave from the Beat Farmers) and Nixon (on permanent leave 
from his senses), who serve up slapstick leaning toward the risque and 
irreverently sociopolitical. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant music modes: R&amp;B, country, Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The last motif was reinforced by a mural of the Strip, tuxes for all (save for 
the outdoorsy Montana, who looked ready to go hunting), and such choices as a 
rockin' "Take a Letter Maria" and a Tom Jones medley. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all the campiness, it might've been nice to hear more of Alvin's sober 
songs and less of Nixon's overbearing mock-Pentecostal preaching. But then, 
restraint was hardly the buzzword for this pleasurably generous, if 
overwhelming, hedonistic revue. CHRIS WILLMAN

'ORIGINAL SIN' IS A 'GODFATHER' CLONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NBC hauls out the big guns tonight with Charlton Heston as an old world crime 
lord in a "Godfather" clone called "Original Sin," airing at 9 p.m. on Channels 
4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is safe in this one, not even the viewer. Ann Jillian plays Sharon 
Richards, whose idyllic suburban life is disrupted when her small son is 
kidnaped. Husband John (Robert Desiderio) is acting a little oddly; could he 
have an idea who's responsible? 
</P>
<P>
It turns out John isn't the orphan Sharon thought -- his dad is an aging king 
of crime called Louis Mancini (Heston) and he just might be involved, directly 
or indirectly, in the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
It's been 10 years since he's been there, but John decides he can, after all, 
go home again -- to get his son back. Naturally he won't get involved in the 
family business. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Philip F. Messina and director Ron Satlof don't believe in letting a 
psychological motivation pass us by, nor do they miss a cliche, from loving 
shots of guns being loaded for action, squealing car chases and slo-mo bloody 
violence to climactic music before each commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
Jillian, in her role as spunky, concerned Mom, is strong, and her emotions ring 
true, but no one else comes close. Instead, intent is telegraphed with 
significant looks and stock dialogue. In the end, it may be sheer inertia and a 
faulty remote control that keeps viewers from seeing what the other networks 
have going in this week's "sweeps-stakes" race. LYNNE HEFFLEY

'GIDEON OLIVER' GETS OFF TO A PONDEROUS START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gideon Oliver is a character for all seasons: a man of action and intellect, a 
teacher, a scholar, an athlete and -- unofficially -- a detective. He even 
dresses great. 
</P>
<P>
An interesting presence. And he has to be to rise above the plot in the 
premiere of "Gideon Oliver" at 9 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third rotating component of "The ABC Mystery Movie" series that 
recently opened with a resurrected "Columbo" starring Peter Falk, followed by 
"B. L. Stryker" starring Burt Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Gossett Jr. is Gideon, a brilliant anthropologist and charismatic college 
professor who tonight injects himself into an investigation of the murder of 
his former girlfriend. Elements of Satanism and kiddie porn surface in a 
laborious story that frequently tangles while seeming at least vaguely 
reminiscent of rumors that have shrouded the infamous McMartin case since its 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
Gideon ends up teaming with a maverick police detective (Michael Rooker) whose 
unorthodox ideas about a Satanic link to some prominent murders places him in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"Gideon Oliver" has nice visual texture and a worthy star in Gossett, whose 
performance as Gideon intriguingly hints at layers yet to be explored and 
growth yet to occur. That's promising. 
</P>
<P>
Without Gossett's intensity, the premiere would be a total loss. Even with it, 
the two hours pass slowly and are strangely unsuspenseful and uninvolving.

SINGING THE BLUES ON 'CENTRAL AVENUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lois Shelton's engrossing documentary, "Ernie Andrews: Blues for Central 
Avenue" (airing on KCET Channel 28 and 10 tonight) skillfully weaves together 
two compelling tales. 
</P>
<P>
Major emphasis goes to the sometimes pain-filled story of the obviously gifted 
singer Andrews, who had hit records while still attending Jefferson High School 
but whose career, through this circumstance and that, never really took off. 
Andrews' life serves as the stepping-off point for an examination of the era of 
L.A.'s Central Avenue, which, from the early-to-late '40s, was a mecca for 
black music and entertainment, as well as being a haven for white patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Using a blend of interview footage, performance shots and still photos, Shelton 
segues smoothly between her subjects. We follow Andrews' career from his 
winning talent contests at age 15 to cutting his first record at 17 and then 
appearing on Central Avenue. Later, with the singer as our guide, we are taken 
to the sites of many of the former night spots. Most of these are vacant lots 
and, with a look of irony on his face, Andrews points out one that once housed 
the Jungle Room, where he and his wife, Delores, were married 36 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with such musicians as Buddy Collette, Harry (Sweets) Edison and 
Eddie Beal, former club owner Esvan Mosby and Delores Andrews add insightful 
information. The film, which briefly but clearly documents the racist attitudes 
and laws prevalent in Los Angeles at the time, makes the case that the open 
fraternization of whites (particularly white females) with blacks led to the 
political and police pressure that ultimately closed down Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The film includes many scenes of Andrews in his milieu, singing portions of 
"Take the 'A' Train," "Teach Me Tonight," "Roll 'Em Pete" and "Lush Life" with 
passion and persuasion and power. ZAN STEWART

Panama cut electricity to 77 homes rented by the U.S. military in the Panama 
Canal area, charging the tenants had not paid their rent, a spokesman for the 
U.S. Southern Command said. More than 100 people were moved out of the homes 
and onto U.S. bases. Last March, the Reagan Administration ordered that all 
U.S. government payments to Panama, including fees for basic services, be made 
to an escrow account in the United States in an effort to keep funds from 
flowing to the government of Panama's strongman, Manuel A. Noriega. The order 
was part of a series of sanctions geared to force Noriega out of power. All of 
the efforts have failed. The majority of the people living in the homes 
affected by the power cut are U.S. Air Force personnel and their families, the 
spokesman said.

WEAPON BAN UNSUPPORTED BY S.D. DELEGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only one of the 11 state lawmakers who represent San Diego County supports 
banning all semiautomatic rifles to stem the growing number of crimes committed 
with so-called "military assault weapons," The Times found in interviews last 
week with members of the county delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) said he supports such a ban even if it is 
seen as infringing on the rights of legitimate sportsmen and hunters. 
</P>
<P>
Such infringement "doesn't bother me at all," said Craven, who has supported 
gun owners in the past but said he sees no hunting or sporting use for 
semiautomatic rifles. "You're not going to go out and put seven shots in a 
deer." 
</P>
<P>
But Craven stands alone. The other 10 county lawmakers have staked out 
positions ranging from opposing all forms of gun control to supporting banning 
assault weapons if a precise, technical definition of such guns can be agreed 
upon. Many say they have yet to make up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
The issue, simmering in the Legislature for several years, has boiled over 
since the January killing of five elementary school students in Stockton by a 
man armed with an AK-47 rifle he bought in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings have prompted a spate of legislation and, last week, a special 
"committee of the whole" in the Assembly, where a number of experts testified 
and answered questions before the entire lower-house membership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Lines 
</P>
<P>
Although sentiment on the issue crosses party lines, Democrats have generally 
leaned toward banning the weapons while Republicans have proposed tougher 
sanctions on criminals who use guns and stricter safeguards to prevent violent 
people from owning weapons of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
Craven, a conservative ex-Marine, said the National Rifle Assn. is mounting a 
"tremendous lobbying effort" aimed at stopping the Legislature from imposing 
any further controls on weapons. He said his mail has run about 60% to 40% 
against gun control. But he believes the broader public supports his position. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are in favor of banning these guns are not as motivated as the 
other side," Craven said. "They don't contact you. But if I went out and 
contacted them, I think I could reverse the percentages." 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme is Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), who said he opposes 
almost every form of gun control. Banning semiautomatic rifles would do little 
or nothing to stop the shootings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The gun is a fortuitous scapegoat for the liberals to draw attention away from 
their terrible policies," Stirling said. "They profess to be concerned about 
poor people and minorities, but poor people and minorities are the greatest 
victims of crime. They (liberals) turn around and say let's take away the guns 
they use to protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The way to prevent violent crime, he said, is to punish criminals severely from 
the time of their first conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to have adequate law enforcement, enforce the laws, a decent prison 
system, longer prison sentences, and take the dysfunctional guys off the 
streets," he said. "It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Stirling said he supports prohibiting gun ownership for anyone who has ever 
been convicted of a crime or been committed to a psychiatric institution -- a 
position that goes beyond any legislation introduced so far this year. He also 
supports creation of a toll-free number for gun shop owners to call for 
information on a potential customer's criminal record before completing a sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part of a Package 
</P>
<P>
The 800 number is one of several proposals endorsed by the Assembly Republican 
Caucus as an alternative to a broad ban on semiautomatics. The package also 
includes a bill prohibiting anyone who has been convicted of a violent offense 
from owning a gun, as well as a measure that would add 10 to 20 years to the 
sentence of anyone who uses a gun in the commission of a felony robbery or 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting that package are Assemblywomen Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) and Sunny 
Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) and Assemblymen Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad) and Bill 
Bradley (R-San Marcos). The four Republicans cited various reasons for their 
opposition to an all-out ban. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he would support a federal ban on assault rifles but fears that a 
state prohibition would be easily circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government should supersede this field so that the states don't 
have to deal with it," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley and Frazee said they doubt that the widely discussed assault rifle can 
be adequately defined. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that you cannot come up with a definition for assault rifle that 
won't also include legitimate semiautomatic hunting rifles," said Bentley, the 
lead Republican member on the Assembly Public Safety Committee. "They are so 
similar that you can't define them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Because They're Ugly? 
</P>
<P>
Frazee added: "We just had a bunch of experts in here, and none of them could 
give us a good definition, other than they're ugly. Well, I don't think we can 
ban all ugly weapons." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa) said he supports a Democrat-backed 
package of bills that would define and ban assault weapons without prohibiting 
such guns as the popular semiautomatic .30-06 hunting rifle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Classify Rifles 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, authored by Assemblyman Johan Klehs (D-San Leandro) would 
classify most semiautomatic rifles as machine guns, which are already 
prohibited by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Klehs' bill would ban semiautomatic, "center-fire" rifles with 
ammunition clips holding nine or more rounds. Hunting guns generally have clips 
that hold only three or four rounds of ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems the responsible thing to do is to craft legislation that defines the 
assault rifle as the average person thinks of it," Peace said. "We need to 
define what it is and get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Not Enough 
</P>
<P>
Peace also supports a registration of parolees convicted of possession of 
illegal weapons, similar to the system now required for sex offenders. He 
endorses the toll-free number for gun sellers proposed by Republicans and also 
supports a 15-day waiting period like the one that is required for handgun 
sales but not for rifles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what kind of computer system you have, you're going to miss some 
people," Peace said. "So you need that waiting period. The only argument I've 
heard against a waiting period is people buying last-minute Christmas presents. 
I don't find that very convincing." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) and Sens. Wadie Deddeh (D-Bonita) and 
Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) said they would support some kind of action 
against assault weapons. But none was able to specify what that action might 
be. Assemblyman Peter Chacon (D-San Diego) was ill last week and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"The current situation is absolutely unacceptable," Deddeh said. "We need to do 
something. What we need to do I don't know yet."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: HE'S ALWAYS ALERT FOR HIGH NOTES AT THE OPERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Harry G. Cooper, the La Jolla computer multimillionaire who last week unveiled 
a proposal to build a new $120-million sports "palace" to replace the aging 
Sports Arena, said that his plans include a high-tech sound system as well 
suited to the arias of Pavarotti as to the bust-your-eardrum decibels of 
heavy-metal rock groups. 
</P>
<P>
Although his friends describe him as an opera buff, Cooper offers a more modest 
explanation of his musical tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm a season ticket holder," he says. "I wouldn't say I'm an expert on 
the operas, but at least I don't sleep through them, either." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pitch, Putt and Swipe 
</P>
<P>
North County culture clash: elderly residents of Encinitas have complained 
bitterly about the disappearance of flagsticks from the greens at their 
pitch-and-putt golf course since migrants began living in a nearby canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The migrants use the poles to hold up their hooches. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-American Tuxedo 
</P>
<P>
It's become a cultural cliche that Soviets visiting the U.S. all want to return 
home wearing All-American blue jeans. Not so conductor Vassili Sinaisky, making 
his first U.S. visit as guest conductor last week for the San Diego Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by his hosts to pick his pleasure, he opted for a made-in-the-U.S.A. 
tuxedo. A fitting was arranged at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Dangerous Lesson 
</P>
<P>
One sunny morning in mid-December, a 31-year-old man in Oceanside had occasion 
to take off all his clothes, run through a plate glass window at an apartment 
building, and begin breaking up furniture and stabbing himself with shards of 
glass. He hurled chunks of glass from a broken mirror at police and other 
bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
A shot from a electric stun gun did not subdue him. A struggle ensued and he 
was shot in the thigh. When he awoke in the hospital, he remembered none of it. 
Police and other witnesses helped fill in the gaps in his memory. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm going to have to stop using crystal," he replied, employing street 
jargon for methamphetamine. Prosecutors agree: last week they ruled the 
shooting by police justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real College Lowdown 
</P>
<P>
Clark Kerr, the one-time president of the University of California, once said 
that the job of a university president is to provide winning football for the 
alumni, parking for the faculty and sex for the students. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere may that be truer than at San Diego State University where President 
Thomas Day is catching hell on all three fronts. 
</P>
<P>
The alumni, stung by last year's 3-8 record, are nervously eyeing the new 
football coach, the unheralded Al Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
The California Faculty Assn., representing the 2,300 faculty, has filed a 
grievance to block the imposition of a $4.50 per month parking fee. The issue 
has gone to a neutral "fact-finder" when the administration refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
And the student newspaper the Daily Aztec has called on Day to reverse his 
decision against condom vending machines (he approves of distribution at the 
student health center and over-the-counter sale at the student store but draws 
the line at coin-op). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fowl Play in Carlsbad 
</P>
<P>
It's been a week now and there are no suspects in the disappearance of the 
7-foot-tall, Fiberglass hen from atop the Country Store on the backside of 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The huge fowl, worth an estimated $2,000, was stolen once before and recovered 
in a field in Leucadia. The eye-catching hen has beckoned drivers along El 
Camino Real since the store opened in 1972, and before that for a decade 
previously when the site was a chicken ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad Police Lt. Greg Fried says detectives have yet to find any clues. 
Pity, because Carlsbad is getting a bit of a reputation as a tough town for 
ceramic creatures. 
</P>
<P>
First the two oversized chickens at the Twin Inns restaurant had to be hidden 
away because they didn't fit in the with the upscale decor of the new owners. 
Then a ceramic pig was stolen from outside a liquor store on Old Highway 101, 
and now this.

SCHOOL FINDS IT'S NOT LONELY AT THE TOP

<P>
The publicists at Palomar Community College have learned some of the perils of 
self-promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what they thought were glowing results of a national licensing 
examination of would-be registered nurses, the San Marcos college issued a 
press release headlined, "Palomar College Nurses Ranked 1 in State, Nation." 
</P>
<P>
The press release read: 
</P>
<P>
"Not all national intercollegiate championships are won on athletic fields. 
Sometimes they can be won in an examination room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highest in the Nation' 
</P>
<P>
"This point has just been proven by a team of 30 proud graduates of Palomar 
College's registered nursing program who achieved the highest ranking in the 
nation on the July 1988 National Council Licensure Examination for Registered 
Nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"A total of 52,284 students from 1,418 nursing education programs took the July 
examination, including students from four-year institutions. The 30 students 
from Palomar, a two-year community college, outranked them all." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar officials based their glowing report on a summary provided by 
CTB/McGraw-Hill, which compiles the test results on behalf of the National 
Council of State Boards of Nursing and distributes them to colleges who pay 
$300 for the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Palomar's summary profile showed that the college ranked "1st of 93" 
among nursing programs in California, and "1st of 1,418" among all nursing 
programs in the United States, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariani Islands. 
</P>
<P>
Wow, Palomar thought. This is tremendous; we're the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But the fine print on the summary page noted: "The rankings were based on the 
percentage of your graduates passing the exam." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Palomar was not the only college in the nation to be ranked 
"1st." Indeed, 115 nursing programs around the nation also were ranked at the 
top because they, too, had 100% pass rates on the July test; in California, 
five nursing programs had 100% pass rates. Palomar was among them. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Miller, assistant director of testing services for the National Council 
of State Boards of Nursing, said there is no attempt to rank colleges in the 
nation for the success of their nursing programs based on test results. In 
fact, she said, the July test was scored solely on a pass/no-pass basis, as 
opposed to the basis of actual test scores, and so the only ranking done by 
CTB/McGraw-Hill was on the basis of the number of students who simply passed 
the test. 
</P>
<P>
Numerical test scores are no longer used, she said, because students and 
colleges tried to manipulate those figures for their own individual, or 
collegiate, promotion. "That was a misuse of the test scores," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goal of Nursing Test 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing the test measures is minimal competence to practice nursing," 
Miller said. "It is not an achievement test. It's not designed to determine who 
is better than others, but simply who is competent (for nursing) and who is 
not." 
</P>
<P>
But confusing the issue was the fact that CTB/McGraw-Hill had not totally 
reprogrammed its computers to reflect the new philosophy. While the rankings 
were made on the basis of what percentage of students passed the test, colleges 
were nonetheless still given individual student scores and a mean average of 
their students' scores. Palomar believed its ranking meant its students' mean 
score was the highest in the nation, and sent out the proud press release. 
</P>
<P>
And a handful of other colleges around the country did the same, because they 
too had 100% pass rates and found themselves ranked No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
A CTB/McGraw-Hill official acknowledged the confusion, and said that when the 
analysis of the next test is distributed, it will more clearly define what 
exactly is meant by a No. 1 ranking. TOM GORMAN

HARD BATTLE MAY FACE GOLDING FOR STATE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If serving good food could get you elected to statewide office, San Diego 
County Supervisor Susan Golding would be well on her way. 
</P>
<P>
Golding, flanked by quesadillas and tortilla chips with first-rate guacamole 
and salsa on the side, entertained dozens of rank-and-file Republican activists 
and a few party leaders at the state GOP convention here over the weekend. 
While officially attending only as a county supervisor and chairwoman of the 
party's group for locally elected officials, Golding made no secret of her 
ambition to move beyond San Diego and play in the state's political big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Golding said she is "99% sure" she will run for lieutenant governor in 1990, 
when U. S. Sen. Pete Wilson seems assured to top the Republican ticket as the 
candidate for governor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eager Field of Legislators 
</P>
<P>
But it will take more than tasty Mexican food to propel Golding into the second 
spot. With Wilson ready to reenter state politics after six years in 
Washington, an eager field of legislators and others who had been hoping to run 
for governor are now looking at the other constitutional offices. 
</P>
<P>
Republican state Sens. William Campbell of Hacienda Heights, Marian Bergeson of 
Newport Beach and John Seymour of Anaheim all have said they are interested in 
the lieutenant governor's job, which until now has been a largely symbolic 
post, ineffective even as a stepping stone to higher office. Orange County 
Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez and former Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach) have 
also been mentioned as possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
All of them have as much as or more statewide stature than Golding because of 
their legislative activity, connections to Gov. George Deukmejian or previous 
attempts at statewide office themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Golding, 43, said she believes she would have as good a chance as any of 
those yet named as possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"No one who is talking about running already has a statewide constituency," she 
said in an interview in her hotel hospitality suite, which she rented with 
personal funds and staffed with three employees from her county office, whose 
expenses she also paid out of her own pocket. "Everyone who is running is going 
to have to start with a local base." 
</P>
<P>
Golding does have some state government experience. After being appointed to 
the San Diego City Council in 1981 with the help of then-Mayor Pete Wilson, she 
left in 1983 to take the job of deputy secretary of business, transportation 
and housing in Deukmejian's administration. Golding quit that post a year later 
to run for county supervisor, and she was reelected to a second four-year term 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'What You Make of It' 
</P>
<P>
Golding first toyed with the idea of running for state office when she went to 
work for Deukmejian. Since her return to San Diego, she has been considered a 
potential candidate for mayor, but Maureen O'Connor was recently reelected and 
will hold that post at least through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The lieutenant governor's job, Golding said, is "what you make of it." 
</P>
<P>
"You can take any constitutional office and become a spokesperson on important 
issues," she said, mentioning as examples the lieutenant governor's role as a 
member of the State Lands Commission and the University of California Board of 
Regents. 
</P>
<P>
A Golding candidacy could be well served by her relationship with Wilson and 
his longtime political advisers, Otto Bos and George Gorton of San Diego. As 
chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors this year, Golding has a chance to be in 
the limelight on important issues such as growth management, the homeless and 
AIDS. And she has proven to be an effective fund-raiser, even though she has 
raised money under local laws that limit contributions to $250. State law 
allows donations of $1,000 from businesses and individuals and up to $5,000 
from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
But some party insiders were saying privately over the weekend that Golding 
might be seen as too liberal, once she is known, to win the GOP nomination. And 
she has been questioned repeatedly about the wisdom of putting two San Diegans 
at the top of the Republican ticket, a question that assumes Wilson will follow 
through with his intention to run for governor and win the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Geography Factor Downplayed 
</P>
<P>
Golding discounts the geographical disadvantage, contending that Wilson, a 
statewide officeholder since 1982, is no longer seen as a San Diegan. And even 
if he is, she said, voters pay little attention to a candidate's hometown when 
they go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever remember voting for someone because of where they lived," she 
said. "I'm more concerned about what they stand for." 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, Golding said, there is still a year before candidates for state 
office must declare their intentions. Although she will be forming an 
"exploratory committee" soon and probably doing some fund raising, Golding said 
she will not make up her mind for many months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm testing the waters," she said. "I'm trying to decide in my own mind what 
I'm going to do."

PIERCE STUDENTS BRING PETS TO KEEP VET PROGRAM ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after county officials removed animals from Pierce College last month, 
Angela Daniel volunteered her pet cocker spaniel to fellow students practicing 
veterinary skills. 
</P>
<P>
When Ebony's turn came up last week, six students and an instructor from the 
college's veterinary assistants training program practiced cleaning the small, 
black dog's teeth as she lay anesthetized, her legs splayed and her pink tongue 
lolling. 
</P>
<P>
Ebony and the pets of 14 other students have become the program's sole source 
of animals since officials from Los Angeles County's Department of Animal Care 
and Control removed 14 dogs and cats from the school's kennels. 
</P>
<P>
County officials decided to return the animals to the county's Agoura Hills 
shelter about four weeks ago after animal rights activists objected to their 
use in teaching Pierce students clinical procedures such as insertion of 
catheters and intravenous tubes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying the animals we removed were in pain or traumatized," said 
Bruce P. Richards, assistant director of the county department, when he 
announced the decision last month. "But we never agreed to let the students use 
them to learn how to insert catheters or intravenous tubes, or take X-rays or 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Experience 
</P>
<P>
The county's removal of the animals -- lost dogs and cats that were claimed by 
no one and that were scheduled for euthanasia by the county -- has left Pierce 
in a quandary. Phil Des Marteau, director of the college's animal health 
technology program, said that unless the college finds a larger supply of dogs 
and cats soon, students will not get enough hands-on experience to become 
competent veterinary assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Des Marteau said he hopes shelter officials will change their minds and 
eventually resume supplying the program with animals. He said the animals are 
sedated to make the procedures, such as drawing blood, as painless as possible. 
</P>
<P>
But animal rights activists say stricter regulation of the college's use of 
animals, including banning procedures that are not necessary for the animals' 
health, should be established first. They said students get enough practical 
experience working with animals during internships at animal hospitals and 
other facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have the right to cause the slightest unnecessary pain, discomfort 
or fear to sentient beings, especially when knowledge can be gained in other 
ways by using a little ingenuity," said Aaron Leider, a spokesman for the North 
Hollywood-based animal rights group, Last Chance for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clear Understanding 
</P>
<P>
Brian Berger, director of Animal Care and Control, said the earliest the county 
would resume supplying the college with animals would be next fall. He said 
that before that happened, he "would want an understanding so clear that there 
was nothing that could be perceived by anyone as misuse of animals." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout California, officials at public and private animal shelters have 
become more hesitant in recent years to lend animals to teaching institutions, 
say veterinary instructors at schools statewide. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the six community colleges and several private vocational schools 
that train veterinary assistants have been increasingly forced to rely on the 
willingness of students to volunteer their pets for laboratory sessions. 
Sometimes they call on other sources, such as program supporters willing to 
donate animals. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate today is very tense," said Joe S. Gloyd, assistant director of the 
American Veterinary Medical Assn., which accredits 62 animal health technology 
programs in the United States. "The number of animals used for instructional 
purposes has really diminished as a result. The bottom line is students come 
out less qualified to care for clients' animals because they've had less 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Guidelines 
</P>
<P>
In rare cases when agencies do lend animals, strict guidelines govern their 
use. For instance, the Pomona Humane Society lends Mt. San Antonio Community 
College in Walnut about 25 dogs per year, said Chuck Hewitt, coordinator of the 
college's agricultural sciences department. The agreement allows the school to 
perform only necessary procedures, such as spaying and neutering, and animals 
cannot be kept longer than overnight, Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do take some heat from students and the industry that our graduates aren't 
as proficient at inserting intravenous catheters as they would be if they had 
more chances to practice," Hewitt said. "But I'd rather take the heat than have 
people tell me we're cruel to animals." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Pierce and Los Angeles County was not as specific about 
allowable procedures and time limits as the pact at Mt. San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The county's agreement, spelled out in a 1982 letter from Des Marteau, 
explained the treatment of animals the college had formerly received from the 
Veterans Administration hospital in West Los Angeles. County officials inferred 
that cats and dogs from the shelter would be treated in a similar manner, said 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Treated for Ailments 
</P>
<P>
Animals from the VA were treated for any ailments they had, the letter said. 
Students "give them their vaccinations, and blanket them with loving 
attention." In return, the letter said, students "learn how to give injections, 
how to restrain properly, and how to make critical evaluations of the animal's 
health." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of an animal's stay, which ranged from three weeks to three months, 
students in the program would try to find them homes, the letter said. It also 
said that "at no time are the animals experimented on or are they used for any 
research project." 
</P>
<P>
County officials said they did not realize until last month that animals were 
being put under general anesthesia about once a month so students could 
practice such procedures as inserting catheters, drawing blood and giving 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
Des Marteau said that a dog might be injected five to 10 times in the course of 
a lab session, but said that "there is no trauma" because the animal is 
sedated. However, county officials withdrew the animals after learning of the 
procedures through citizens' complaints. Techniques practiced at the college 
are "not medical experimentation, but we have the public's confidence to 
consider, in addition to the fact that they're not doing what's stated in the 
1982 correspondence," Richards said last month at a press conference announcing 
the removal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Upset 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the animals upset Daniel, 22, of Ventura, who said she is 
studying to become one of about 18,000 veterinary assistants in the nation 
because "I love animals, not because I want to hurt them. If there was anything 
wrong with what we were doing -- if the animals felt anything -- I wouldn't let 
them use Ebony." 
</P>
<P>
In the search for alternatives to animals that come from shelters, some 
programs have purchased animals, said Paul F. Cook, a veterinarian and 
president-elect of the Assn. of Veterinary Technician Educators. 
</P>
<P>
But Pierce lacks the funds to spend $200 to $500 per animal, Des Marteau said. 
Enrollment in the college's program, and consequently funding, has declined in 
recent years, although the demand for veterinary assistants has increased, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer people are studying to become veterinary assistants because it is not a 
lucrative field, said Gloyd of the American Veterinary Medical Assn. Annual 
salaries for veterinary assistants, most of whom are female, range from about 
$11,000 to $25,000, depending on experience, Gloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School-Owned Animals 
</P>
<P>
Some programs, such as the one at Cosumnes River College in Sacramento, house 
groups of school-owned animals on campus and find homes for them at the end of 
each school year. The animals are donated by program supporters because using 
strays can present legal problems, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Cosumnes River College, for example, strays were used after they had gone 
unclaimed for two weeks until a local animal rights group objected on grounds 
that the animals' owners might still be trying to find them, said Cheryl Buch, 
an animal health technology instructor at the college. The animals were sent to 
shelters after the group objected, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a total waste to send those animals to the shelters where most of 
them will be destroyed," Buch said. "When they join our colony, they are only 
used four times a year and are adopted out in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Des Marteau also pointed out that one effect of the Pierce program is to extend 
the lives of animals that otherwise might be destroyed at county shelters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality of Life 
</P>
<P>
But Barbara Fabricant, president of the Humane Task Force, a private, nonprofit 
organization based in Canoga Park, said: "An animal is not an inanimate object 
to be practiced on. I strongly believe it's not life, it's the quality of life 
that counts." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles also would rather see animals put to death than have 
them used in Pierce's program or for any other medical purpose, said Walter E. 
Ziegler, chief veterinarian for the city Department of Animal Regulation. In 
fiscal year 1986-87, shelter officials put to death 60,671 or about 68% of the 
89,357 live dogs and cats they received, Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gloyd disagreed, saying "waking up from anesthesia is better than not 
waking up at all."

NURSE, BED SHORTAGES CLOSE 13 EMERGENCY ROOMS IN AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortages of nurses and beds forced administrators at 13 San Fernando Valley 
area hospitals to close their emergency room doors to patients requiring acute 
care during the weekend, leaving other facilities struggling to cope with the 
overflow. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were warned that critically ill or seriously injured patients would 
not be admitted to the overcrowded emergency rooms, even if they were the 
closest facilities to the patients. Emergency patients who came to hospitals on 
their own were not denied treatment, however, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
"Medical gridlock" -- rashes of emergency rooms closing at the same time, 
leaving paramedics spinning their ambulance wheels waiting for empty beds to 
deliver patients -- has hit Los Angeles County hard. The problem is 
particularly severe in the inner city, where many hospitals, unwilling to 
absorb the cost of treating patients too poor to pay, have closed emergency 
rooms or cut back emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency care in the Valley has not reached the critical condition of downtown 
and South-Central Los Angeles, but the problem is spreading. Unlike inner-city 
hospitals, which usually close because they lack space for patients, Valley 
hospitals often close with intensive care unit beds empty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Few Nurses 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the nurses to take care of the patients. It's not due to 
saturation -- a lack of beds -- it's a lack of nurses," said Chester Wheeler, 
nursing supervisor at Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, which closed 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Presbyterian closed with nine of its 23 intensive care unit beds empty 
because only seven nurses in that unit were available to work, Wheeler said. 
Normal staffing for the unit is 11 or 12 nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Humana Hospital West Hills closed all day Saturday and most of 
Sunday with beds open in its 16-bed intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We exhausted our nursing supply and none were available from the nursing 
registry," a temporary nursing service, said Greg Potenza, the hospital's 
public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama Community Hospital in Panorama City closed its doors Saturday "because 
we had no nurses to care for any more patients even though there was maybe a 
bed or two empty" in the hospital's 10-bed intensive care unit, said nursing 
supervisor Milo Huempfner. "It's increasingly a problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Options 
</P>
<P>
Nursing, once one of the few careers open to women, has declined in popularity 
among females as other professional opportunities have opened to them, nursing 
supervisors said Sunday. The percentage of men entering the field has not 
increased correspondingly, however, creating a tremendous shortage of nurses 
throughout the medical world. 
</P>
<P>
"Enrollment in nursing programs has declined markedly because women have chosen 
other career fields and men haven't been actively recruited," Huempfner said. 
</P>
<P>
When nurses do complete training programs, they often choose not to work for 
hospitals, lured to home health agencies, medical equipment companies, 
attorneys or private companies by higher salaries and better benefits and 
hours. The impression that hospitals "traditionally have catered to physicians 
and not nurses" further deters nurses from working there, Huempfner said. 
</P>
<P>
But Valley hospitals, particularly smaller ones, do sometimes close their 
emergency rooms because they have filled each bed for critically ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
As hospitals close units for lack of nurses or beds, others strain to take up 
the slack, creating jams in their emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"When other hospitals are closed, that puts a strain on the entire system. It 
impacts us a lot," said Holly Lyons, nursing supervisor at Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills, which was open most of the weekend. "And it's a heck 
of a big deal if you are the patient. Instead of being five minutes from 
emergency care, you might be 10 or 15 minutes from emergency care." 
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, a walk-in patient with less serious problems must 
often wait for hours to be seen by a doctor, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lyons said that emergency room closures in the Valley seem to have 
increased dramatically in the last six months, she said that she does not 
believe the Valley's problem is a consequence of the emergency care shortage 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't get a lot of crossover. Not that many patients are coming up in this 
direction," she said. "Most of my patients are coming from the immediate 
vicinity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Definition 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lyons said, increased closures are a result of the nursing shortage, 
an over-reliance on emergency care and a changing definition of what 
constitutes an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Larger hospitals are not immune to the problem, either. Judy Kuble, nursing 
supervisor at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, which has one of the Valley's 
biggest emergency rooms, said it was closed to emergency patients last Monday 
through Wednesday and part of the day Friday. "If you don't have R.N.s to take 
care of patients, you can't stay open," Kuble said. 
</P>
<P>
Other hospital emergency rooms that were closed over all or part of the weekend 
were Encino Hospital, Granada Hills Community Hospital, Henry Mayo Newhall 
Hospital in Valencia, Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, Valley 
Medical Center in Van Nuys, North Hollywood Medical Center, Pacifica Hospital 
in Sun Valley, Medical Center of Tarzana, Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar 
and Westlake Hospital in Westlake Village.

WESTLAKE VILLAGE MAN PILOTED CRASHED PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The pilot of a Boeing 747 cargo plane that crashed into a Malaysian hillside 
and killed its four-person crew was identified Sunday as Frank Halpin, 59, of 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
The cargo plane was operated by the Los Angeles-based Flying Tigers Line and 
was preparing to land at Subang International Airport when it crashed into the 
jungle about seven miles from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. 
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred at about 2:30 p.m. Saturday, California time. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Chuck Thomson said Halpin had been a pilot for Flying Tigers 
since April, 1955. He said Halpin had flown Boeing 747s for 14 years, including 
eight years as captain. 
</P>
<P>
"He has an excellent reputation as a pilot," Thomson said. He added that Halpin 
was considered to be in excellent health. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was en route from Singapore and was about half full of mail, clothing 
and computer hardware, Thomson said. Low clouds and mist prevailed in the area 
at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The plane's engine, cockpit and wings were found smoldering and strewn through 
the jungle at the crash site. Thomson said investigators had recovered the 
plane's flight recorders "but we still have no clue as to what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The jet's maintenance record offered no clues as to the cause of the crash. 
"The maintenance folks have gone over the log sheets and it's a very clean 
airplane," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said Halpin was married, but he declined to release the name of 
Halpin's spouse. He said she was secluded with members of her family. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson said he did not know whether the couple had any children. 
</P>
<P>
The other crew members were identified as: First Officer Jack Robinson of 
Tucson, Ariz., a veteran of 21 years with the company; Second Officer Ronald 
Penton of Burlingame, who had flown for 32 years, and maintenance engineer 
Leonard Sulewski of White House Station, N.J., who had been with the company 
for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
Flying Tigers operates three flights a week from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur.

POLICE IDENTIFY BODY FOUND NEAR FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Homicide detectives identified Sunday the partially decomposed body of a man 
found under some brush near the Glendale Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Officers were unable to say how long Noel P. Quinn, 36, of Mount Washington had 
been dead, but "he had been there quite a while," said Los Angeles police Sgt. 
Joe Ramm. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans workers found Quinn's blanket-wrapped body Saturday near the Verdugo 
Road exit of the freeway. The body had rolled down an embankment and under some 
brush, police said. The cause of death has not yet been determined, Ramm said. 
Investigators are treating it as a homicide, he said.

SOCKERS AVOID ROUGH STUFF WHILE DEFEATING STARS, 9-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LAWRENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TACOMA, Wash. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Tacoma players had singled out Branko Segota and promised retribution 
after the Sockers' rowdy victory Friday in San Diego, the Stars spent most of 
Sunday's game at the Tacoma Dome on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers took advantage by rolling to a 9-4 Major Indoor Soccer League 
victory, one of their finest efforts of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Defender Kevin Crow and forward Steve Zungul did most of the dirty work, but 
not with elbows or kicks. Crow blocked seven shots (Tacoma rattled off 43 
shots) and had a goal and an assist. Zungul tormented his former mates with the 
game-winning goal and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we touched seemed to turn to gold," said Socker Coach Ron Newman. 
"I felt a little sorry for Tacoma." 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us a lesson, didn't they?" said Stars' Coach Alan Hinton. "When I 
was in school and I did something wrong, my mother would give me an 
old-fashioned thrashing. That's what they did to us." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, after a flat month or so, San Diego has won three of its past four games 
impressively and opened a 2 1/2-game lead over third-place Dallas. The Sockers 
are 3 1/2 games behind first-place Baltimore, which lost Sunday to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the time of year when teams really start to assert themselves," Crow 
said. "If we are to pull away from the rest of the guys and try to catch 
Baltimore, we need to separate ourselves from them and get a little cushion." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego bolted to leads of 6-1 and 7-2 before two fourth-quarter Tacoma goals 
brought the 6,464 fans to life, temporarily. Then Crow's goals put the game out 
of reach. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the vengeance hype, Sunday's game was normal for the most part. There 
were, however, two elbows to the ribs of Socker defender Ralph Black, the first 
by Gregg Blasingame, the second by Gerry Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually find that in these little games that the animosity doesn't linger," 
said Newman. "I told our boys not to do anything, because the referees read the 
paper and they were going to be very particular." 
</P>
<P>
Crow, the Sockers' perennial all-star, said, "Sometimes that stuff (dirty play) 
gets blown out of proportion. You can never plan a battle. That stuff happened 
because of the circumstances on the field at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is a very emotional game. You are playing each other so often, 
sometimes individuals can get on each others' nerves. Even though you are 
buddies off the field, sometimes, through personalities, a circuit goes and 
things like ()that happen." 
</P>
<P>
One of the cool heads on the Sockers was Zungul. 
</P>
<P>
"We controlled the ball, we controlled the space, and we controlled our 
temper," said Zungul. "With all these little things and the discipline we have, 
we didn't have a chance to lose the game." 
</P>
<P>
Segota, the announced target, came through almost unscathed and scored a goal 
and an assist, though he said he played cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's more the fans and the press," said Segota. "They build it up. The 
players are a little smarter. Nobody likes to come out kicking. We wanted to 
come out and have a good game." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, they did. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sockers forward Zoran Karic, the team's leading goal scorer, bruised his foot 
on a San Diego power play. His status will be determined today. . . . San Diego 
Coach Ron Newman admitted that he was talking to Los Angeles Sunday about a 
trade involving Lazers' Waad Hirmez, a midfielder, and Jim Gorsek, a 
goalkeeper, both of whom are former Sockers. The speculation is that injuries 
to Zoltan Toth and Brian Quinn might be more serious than first feared. . . . 
Coach Alan Hinton said he is discussing trades with several clubs, but Newman 
said he had not talked with Hinton. The Sockers reportedly are interested in 
midfielder Gerry Gray.

NORTHRIDGE TEAMS UP TO OVERCOME ST. MARY'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BAXTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Cal State Northridge Coach Bill Kernen's way of thinking, Sunday's 2-1 
nonconference baseball win over St. Mary's was a real team effort. Trouble was, 
a big part of his team wasn't there to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Greg Shockey was scratched from the lineup and sent to the hospital 
complaining of stomach cramps early Sunday, and shortstop Mike Solar joined him 
a short time later after gashing the middle finger of his throwing hand during 
batting practice. That suddenly left Kernen with two gapping holes to fill. 
</P>
<P>
Which is where Vale Lopez and Ted Weisfuss come in. Lopez, making his first 
start of the season, fired a masterful three-hitter and Weisfuss, subbing for 
Solar, drove in the winning run with a double in the bottom of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"That's exactly what a team does," Kernen said. "When someone goes down, you 
pick up for them. When something happens, you overcome it. A good team will 
overcome adversity." 
</P>
<P>
To do that, CSUN (6-1) had to overcome another formidable foe: St. Mary's 
left-hander David Norris. Though eight innings, Norris (1-2) had CSUN stymied, 
scattering seven hits and allowing just two runners to reach second base. 
</P>
<P>
But that was a ragged effort compared with Lopez's gem. Lopez (1-0) struck out 
seven, did not walk a batter and set the Gaels (6-4) down in order six times. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an outstanding pitching performance," Kernen said. "It was pretty 
much of a domination. He only made one mistake all day." 
</P>
<P>
But that mistake cost him a run. With the game scoreless in the third inning, 
Lopez let a 2-1 fastball get away from him and James Mouton promptly lined it 
over the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez recovered quickly, however, setting down the next 10 batters in a row, 
and his teammates got the run back in the fifth. After just missing a home run 
with a foul drive down the left-field line, Kevin Ogle settled for a line-drive 
double into the left-center-field gap. One out later, J.D. Haendiges blooped an 
opposite-field single to left to score Ogle. 
</P>
<P>
That was the extent of the offense until the ninth. Dennis Vigo led off with a 
line single to left and after Rusty McLain dropped down a perfect sacrifice 
bunt, Norris walked Ogle to get to Weisfuss. But the strategy backfired when 
Weisfuss ripped a 1-0 fastball over the left-center-field wall on a bounce.

In another move against avant-garde art exhibits in Beijing, Chinese police 
have raided a controversial exhibition of nude paintings influenced by Tibetan 
Buddhism, artists told Reuters on Sunday. The raid came just days after a 
controversial exhibition of nude paintings in Beijing's national art gallery 
was closed down for the second time by police. Uniformed policemen confiscated 
six paintings from the Beijing Artists Gallery on Saturday evening and 
questioned artist Cao Yong about their content, a witness said. The exhibition 
had been on display to the public for five days and was being packed up when 
the police arrived. Earlier Saturday, officials from the legal department of 
Beijing's cultural office visited Cao's exhibition to tell him that members of 
the public had complained about his work. (One painting shows a heap of naked 
women below Buddhist monk-like figures, and another depicts a woman dragging 
two men out of a fire by their genitalia.)

Production has begun on the first prime-time animated series in more than a 
decade. NBC's "Hound Town," a half-hour comedy set in a typical American 
suburb, "concerns the lives that dogs have of which humans are unaware," 
according to director Ralph Bakshi, who added: "The dogs have their own views 
of humans and ultimately turn out to be more civilized than we are." The series 
is tentatively scheduled for a Friday night time slot.

Look for lots of coverage of Asia this week, with the networks focusing on 
President Bush's attendance at the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito 
followed by Bush's visit to Beijing and Seoul. The three networks, as well as 
Cable News Network, will each have more than a half-dozen correspondents 
reporting from the area. To be included in the Asian trek are CBS' Dan Rather, 
NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Peter Jennings. Live coverage of the Thursday 
funeral will be provided by CNN and CBS (during the 8 p.m. telecast of "48 
Hours").

With the national spotlight fixed on the mounting crisis in the nation's 
savings and loan industry, the calls are growing louder in Washington to 
accelerate the prosecution of those who played significant parts in causing 
hundreds of thrift collapses in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are corrupt, those who break the law, must be kicked out of the 
(savings and loan) business and they should go to jail," President Bush told 
Congress earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for these failures? Where are they now? Are they going to 
jail? What kinds of sentences are being handed out? 
</P>
<P>
Based on court documents, public records, news reports and interviews, here are 
the stories of five ex-thrift executives whose questionable banking practices 
sparked criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
David L. Butler 
</P>
<P>
David L. Butler, erstwhile wonder boy who once owned and operated Bell Savings 
in San Mateo, Calif., is a pale shade of his old self. 
</P>
<P>
The $50,000 Jaguar is gone, replaced by a gray Mercury four-door. So is the 
cockiness that accompanied having a net worth of between $70 million and $80 
million at age 31. "I'm broke," he said in an interview last week in a 
Sacramento coffee shop. "I'm zeroed out." 
</P>
<P>
Now 36, Butler is headed to jail next month to serve a two-year term for 
insider bank fraud after pleading guilty to loan fraud and misusing millions of 
dollars of Bell Savings' money. He was also placed on five years' probation and 
must perform 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the severity of the crime, the sentence has angered some law 
enforcement officials. "That's a dumb message: 'Crime pays,' " one regulatory 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, which handled the prosecution, had 
asked for a relatively light three-year sentence on the grounds that Butler had 
cooperated with the government and had made a convincing case that he had 
turned his life around. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years was less than we would have liked," prosecutor John Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's cooperation with the government led to fraud charges against two 
former business associates, but those charges were eventually dropped when 
prosecutors were unable to corroborate the accusations, Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler epitomizes a new breed of bank crook -- sophisticated and well-educated 
-- who lived a prince's life on customers' savings and kept pushing the 
investment rules until he finally broke them. Raised in a middle-class milieu 
in upstate New York and Florida, Butler is a college graduate and former 
navigator in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's interview, he attributed his downfall to good intentions 
gradually gone awry. Sounding matter-of-fact and not overly contrite, Butler 
said the lines between right and wrong blurred as time went on and business 
difficulties mounted. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not see the savings and loan as a way to come in and commit grand 
larceny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he freely admits now that he broke federal banking laws by having Bell 
Savings lend money on development projects in which he had a concealed 
interest. The loans were made on projects that had gotten into trouble, 
including a 14-story high-rise in downtown Sacramento known as One City Centre. 
</P>
<P>
"The long and short of it is, I tried to solve problems on projects in which I 
had an interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler and a business partner bought control of financially ailing Bell 
National, the parent company, in 1982 by putting up nearly $4 million in cash 
and giving Bell ownership of Butler's troubled development company. Butler 
planned to restore the thrift to health by making construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Bell National made money on large loan fees, as much as $13 
million a year. "On paper, it was great," Butler recalled. 
</P>
<P>
He received cash compensation of $668,800 in 1983, and a bonus of $629,434 in 
1984 on top of his monthly salary. His company car was a Jaguar, while the 
other thrift executives and directors drove Mercedeses. One lending official, 
Butler's girlfriend at the time, was given a red Ferrari, according to a 
shareholder lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
But Bell Savings ultimately failed because its construction loans, made mostly 
in Texas and the Silicon Valley, lost more than half their value after the two 
regions were hit hard by economic downturns in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
For all his past problems, Butler is down but not out. He still has a home, 
family and, until recently, a job as general manager of a dental products firm 
near Sacramento. He is mulling the possibility of a book about bank fraud and 
does not appear frightened about spending time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Where does he want to spend his period of incarceration? "I asked for the Hyatt 
Regency," he quipped. "I told them I wouldn't go out of my room." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don Ray Dixon 
</P>
<P>
When historians record the turbulent times of the thrift industry in the 1980s, 
the name of Don Ray Dixon is sure to get prominent mention. 
</P>
<P>
He was arguably the highest of the high-living real estate developers who, 
attracted by vastly expanded investment powers for thrifts, flocked en masse 
into the savings and loan industry early in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon bought control of Vernon Savings, a thrift in north Texas, and used the 
financial institution to finance European junkets and a fabulous life style in 
San Diego. When the thrift was seized by regulators nearly two years ago, 
nearly all its loans were in default. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Vernon's possessions included a corporate jet, a 
Falcon 50; a $2.6-million yacht known as High Spirits; a Ferrari and 
Rolls-Royce dealership in La Jolla; a $1-million home in Solano Beach, and a 
$2-million home in Del Mar, where Dixon lived rent-free. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is now paying for the good times. He has filed for personal bankruptcy, 
been targeted in a $540-million civil fraud suit filed by the government and is 
among dozens of executives under criminal investigation by an FBI and Justice 
Department task force in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Dixon works out of a small office building in Laguna Beach, but 
precisely what he does is something of an enigma. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon's criminal lawyer in Dallas, William M. Ravkind, says Dixon "was trying 
to make a living being a broker, but I don't even know what he was brokering. 
The bankruptcy pretty much wiped him out." 
</P>
<P>
According to one recent newspaper report, Dixon frequently plays golf at La 
Costa Hotel &amp; Spa resort in San Diego and "dabbles" in off-shore insurance 
companies. Also, according to the report in the Wall Street Journal, he is said 
to have received a target letter from criminal prosecutors in Dallas, 
indicating that he may be indicted soon. 
</P>
<P>
But that report was denied by Dixon's attorneys, who say he has not yet 
received a target letter, is not involved in off-shore insurance and has not 
played golf at La Costa in years. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon is traveling in Israel and could not be reached for comment. In the past 
when he has discussed Vernon Savings, he justified the perquisites and life 
style as necessary for a backwater thrift to attract important business. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't access Florida development loans or Southern California construction 
loans by taking a Greyhound bus out of Vernon, Tex." he said in an interview 
with The Times last year. 
</P>
<P>
One notorious company-paid trip to Europe was a whirlwind eating binge at some 
of France's best restaurants that lasted 10 days. The journey was supposedly 
part of a marketing study for a plan to open a fancy restaurant in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
In a 17-page diary of the trip, Dixon's wife, Dana, described the time as a 
"flying house party" and a "gastronomique fantastique." Dixon, however, offered 
a more mundane view of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"You think it's easy eating in three-star restaurants twice a day six days a 
week?" he asked a Chicago Tribune reporter last summer. "By the end of the 
week, you want to spit it (the food) out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charles W. Knapp 
</P>
<P>
It has been 54 months since Charles W. (Charlie) Knapp was ousted from his post 
as chairman and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Financial Corp. of 
America, then the nation's largest savings and loan company. 
</P>
<P>
Cushioned by a $2-million severance payment at the time regulators forced him 
to resign, Knapp quickly bounced back from the debacle, forming his own 
merchant banking company in Westwood known as Trafalgar Holdings that now 
dabbles in everything from corporate takeovers to mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
FCA never bounced back, though, nor did its operating subsidiary, American 
Savings &amp; Loan. After years of horrendous losses on Knapp-era real estate 
development loans, American Savings failed last fall and was placed in 
government receivership. Stripped of its only substantive asset, FCA filed for 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
American Savings was later turned over to Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass as 
part of a federally assisted rescue expected to cost at least $1.7 billion -- 
funds that will be paid by the U.S. taxpayer and the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
One of the strongest criticisms of Knapp came in an internal FCA study done in 
1986 that accused his management team of causing loan losses of more than $400 
million. FCA had also deliberately pumped up its earnings and assets "to 
inflate the market price of its stock, all for (Knapp's) own personal financial 
gain and self aggrandizement," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp, 54, has argued in court papers and past interviews that he has been made 
a scapegoat for the failings of regulators and the management that succeeded 
him. He could not be reached to comment for this article. 
</P>
<P>
FCA's past lending activities have been the subject of a criminal investigation 
by the FBI for several years, public documents show. But Knapp has not been 
accused of wrongdoing by any government agency, nor is he likely to be, 
according to his attorney, Arthur N. Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"The information that I have is that there is no basis for criminal or civil 
actions by the government," Greenberg said. "Nothing was done that was wrong or 
illegal." 
</P>
<P>
A regulatory official in California, who asked not to be identified, agreed, 
saying: "I think he'll slide." 
</P>
<P>
But another government official, who also asked to remain anonymous, confirmed 
that a criminal investigation of FCA is continuing, adding that it is 
ultimately going to be up to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles to 
determine what to do with the FBI's findings. 
</P>
<P>
"If something is going to happen," he said, "it will be within the next few 
months." Robert C. Bonner, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
J. William Oldenburg 
</P>
<P>
J. William Oldenburg, one-time owner of the now-defunct Los Angeles Express 
football team, is brokering mortgage loans as usual from his office in the 
Transamerica tower in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But these are hardly usual times for the 50-year-old financier, who faces a 
42-year prison term and $44,000 in fines if convicted on all charges in a bank 
fraud indictment filed last month against him and three former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-count indictment charges them with conspiring to defraud State Savings 
&amp; Loan in Salt Lake City by using $21.5 million in thrift funds toward the 
purchase of an overpriced piece of property he owned in the San Francisco Bay 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg bought the 363-acre property in 1973 for less than $1 million and 
later sold it for many times that amount to State Savings, which he also owned. 
Appraisals on the property exceeded $50 million, but they were "deficient, 
exaggerated and unreliable," the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg could not be reached for comment, but his lawyer, Joseph L. Alioto, 
scoffed at the charges, saying they were handed down simply because the 
five-year statute of limitations was about to run out. "He'll be acquitted for 
sure," said Alioto, who was San Francisco's mayor from 1967 to 1976. "It's a 
phony case." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the indictment is the latest in a series of setbacks for the flamboyant 
Oldenburg, a short, stocky one-time vacuum-cleaner salesman who later billed 
himself as a "self-made billionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg once stunned the sports world by agreeing to give quarterback Steve 
Young a $36-million lifetime contract to play for the Express, which was a part 
of the United States Football League. The team folded in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg built an empire as a mortgage broker who specialized in helping 
thrifts to buy loan participations in residential and commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a recent congressional committee report on bank fraud, 
Oldenburg ended up arranging for thrifts around the nation to participate in 
bad loans. Several of the institutions later failed. Oldenburg was "involved in 
various capacities with a number of insolvent S&amp;Ls," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
State Savings was closed in 1985 after regulators declared the institution 
insolvent in what was at the time one of the most expensive failures in savings 
and loan history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daniel W. Dierdorff 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Sun Savings founder Dan Dierdorff pleaded guilty to illegally 
transferring more than $200,000 in thrift funds to a secret account and forging 
a signature on a $2,000 check. Last Monday, the former varsity wrestler at San 
Diego State College got his punishment from U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades 
-- an eight-year prison term and an order to pay fines and restitution of more 
than $212,000. 
</P>
<P>
The tough sentence completed the downfall of the 52-year-old Dierdorff, a man 
whose plight had sparked widespread support for him among well-known San 
Diegans. Among those who wrote letters on his behalf were San Diego City 
Manager John Lockwood and former San Diego Charger football player Kellen 
Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
One friend, banker Dan McSweeney, characterized Dierdorff as a naive 
businessman who had risen too fast in the thrift world and was "in over his 
head." McSweeney argued that Dierdorff be allowed to perform community service 
chores rather than be forced to spend time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Yesmin Saide, in pre-sentencing arguments, painted a 
far different portrait, calling Dierdorff a "greedy, ruthless, power-hungry man 
driven to fatten his own wallet" through a scheme of loan fraud and kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Dierdorff and opened Oct. 6, 1980, Sun Savings had a short shelf 
life. It was seized by thrift regulators and declared insolvent in July, 1986. 
Dierdorff served as Sun Savings' chief executive and chairman until he resigned 
in late 1984. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Dierdorff received exorbitant salaries for running a 
financial institution that made high-risk and imprudent loans. He was 
"motivated by personal benefit and greed and involved Sun Savings in business 
transactions that were never in the institution's best interest," the 
government said in a pre-sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Dierdorff set up a phony bank account, known as the "Danzer 
account," into which he deposited more than $200,000 in funds that he later 
admitted came from loan kickbacks, court papers show. 
</P>
<P>
To hide the account and conceal the funding source, Dierdorff misled the 
thrift's outside auditors and lied to regulators, saying the money came from 
gambling winnings in Las Vegas. Dierdorff admitted to regulators last summer 
that the money came from bribes or kickbacks on Sun Savings' deals, the 
prosecution said. 
</P>
<P>
"Flat broke," according to his attorney, and in tears before his sentencing, 
Dierdorff told the court that he never intended to "hurt anybody, including Sun 
Savings." Free on $75,000 bond, Dierdorff is expected to enter prison March 27.

POLICE KILL MAN THEY SAY WAS RUSHING THEM WITH WEAPONS

A Huntington Beach man who "charged" at two police officers with martial arts 
weapons in each hand was shot and killed Sunday in a home on a quiet 
residential street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County in 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to a disturbance call at a house in the 6800 block of Red 
Coach Drive about 1:15 p.m. and were confronted by Alan Edward Norried, 26, 
Huntington Beach Police Sgt. William Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had some kind of an Okinawan karate weapon" in one hand and a nunchaku in 
the other hand, Stuart said. "Apparently he charged toward the officers and 
they opened fire." 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the officers was injured and their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Investigations Sgt. W.C. Peterson said officers were 
called to the residence by a neighbor reporting a disturbance. Upon arriving, 
they heard noise inside the home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Confronted 
</P>
<P>
The officers "called into the home and were admitted to the home where they 
were confronted by Alan Norried," according to Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"Norried advanced on officers with a martial arts-type weapon in each hand," he 
said. "Repeated demands by officers to drop the weapons and freeze . . . were 
ignored and the officers retreated for their safety." 
</P>
<P>
When "Norried reached a point very close to the officers and they were in 
danger of serious injury, two officers fired at Norried," Peterson said. He was 
pronounced dead at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Both officers were placed on administrative leave with pay, in keeping with 
department policy, Peterson said. Police declined to comment further on the 
case, referring inquiries to the Orange County district attorney's office, 
which was investigating the matter as is standard procedure for 
officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
One Red Coach Drive neighbor who asked that she not be identified said police 
had been to the residence where Norried was shot on prior occasions. Stuart 
said he could not verify that claim Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Norried's parents have lived at the residence about 15 years and he 
occasionally lived there with them, the neighbor said. Yet the man and his 
family were not particularly well known in the neighborhood, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart said the Okinawan karate weapon held by Norried was "a sai," which 
originally was a farm implement. 
</P>
<P>
"One pointed end is used for thrusting and stabbing movements" while the other, 
forked end is used "to catch wrists, clothing or other weapons an opponent may 
have," he said. "It is used to twist, lock or disable an opponent." 
</P>
<P>
The nunchaku is a martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected with a 
rope or chain, Stuart said. 
</P>
<P>
The death was the third fatal police shooting in Orange County since Jan. 20, 
when Dennis Paul Gonzales, 20, of Garden Grove was shot to death in a volley of 
gunfire by two Garden Grove policemen responding to a disturbance call at a 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the officers opened fire only after seeing Gonzales point what 
later was determined to be a toy gun at them. Three eyewitnesses to the 
shooting disputed the police version of the incident, although a district 
attorney's investigator said preliminary investigation cast doubt on the 
witnesses' account. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2 police shot and killed an unarmed man outside an Anaheim motel room 
near Disneyland, where his wife and 9-year-old stepson were waiting for him to 
return from an errand. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vincent Edson, 28, of Orange, died of a single gunshot wound when two 
uniformed Anaheim police officers fired 10 shots at him following an auto 
chase. Police said Edson had appeared to reach for a weapon on the second-floor 
balcony of the motel. 
</P>
<P>
Edson's friends said the man led police on a 45-minute chase when they tried to 
stop him for a traffic violation because he was driving with a suspended 
license and could not afford auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The Edson shooting also is under investigation by the county district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 4 the district attorney's office cleared Newport Beach police of 
wrongdoing in the shooting of an unarmed Liberian immigrant along the beach 
last Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Sundaga Bryant, a Santa Ana resident, was critically wounded in his arms and 
torso by a single blast from the officer Derek Duncan's 12-gauge shotgun. The 
officer said he mistook a portable radio that Bryant carried for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach officer "reasonably and honestly, albeitly mistakenly, 
believed that he was being confronted by a life-threatening danger," 
investigators from the district attorney's office concluded in ruling out 
criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 26 at the time, has sued the city of Newport Beach and Duncan for $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years there have been a number of fatal shootings by Huntington Beach 
police. On Sept. 22, 1988, the son of a Los Angeles County sheriff's lieutenant 
was shot to death by an officer who responded to a disturbance at a Jamaica 
Circle home where the man appeared at the door with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 two men were killed by Huntington Beach police. On Aug. 1, 1985, a 
Huntington Beach police officer shot and killed a man who threatened him and 
others with a knife at a Wildrose Lane home. And on April 13, 1985, a 
Huntington Beach police officer killed a robbery suspect when he responded to a 
silent burglar alarm and was confronted by two men at a shop near Main Street.

THE CYCLE OF CRIME; 
</P>
<P>
OVER 20 YEARS, TIMES HAVE CHANGED, AS HAVE YOUNGSTERS, OFFENSES, THE LEGAL 
SYSTEM ANDTHE YOUTH GUIDANCE CENTER.

<P>
Joe is 16, a gang member and drug abuser, and in the last 3 years he has never 
been out of juvenile detention more than 2 months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Last week he sat in a cramped counselor's office at the Youth Guidance Center, 
where he is doing his fourth stint, this time for violating probation. Away 
from the inquiring eyes of his blue-clad fellow inmates, he was reflective 
about his troubled young life. 
</P>
<P>
"I do good for a little while but then I start hanging with my buddies and the 
same things happen again," said Joe, which is not his real name. "Even if I'm 
in my own neighborhood, hanging around with my cousin or my brothers, I can get 
busted cause they're all involved in gangs. I'm not supposed to be around them, 
but it's not like I can go to another part of town." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anniversary Celebrated 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of youths like Joe walk the streets of Orange County these days, 
caught in a cycle of drugs, gangs and crime. First-time offenders, probation 
violators and youngsters who have committed more serious crimes and have done 
their time in Juvenile Hall are sentenced to the Youth Guidance Center, known 
as the YGC -- four isolated cinder block buildings nestled between the river 
and Interstate 5 in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
It was 20 years ago this month that the the center first opened its doors to 
the county's troubled youth. At a ceremony recently marking the anniversary, 
counselors and probation officials agreed that as the times have changed, so 
have the youngsters, the crimes, the legal system -- and the role of the YGC. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids are more criminally sophisticated now," said Mike Schumacher, the 
county's chief probation officer. "They seem to be more violence-prone and more 
drug-prone. It has created a more callous group of young people." 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters of 1969, however, were a different breed. They lived in the age 
of Aquarius, psychedelic music and distrust of authority. Most committed to the 
center were fairly innocent -- runaways and truants -- who may have dabbled 
with mind-altering drugs or were just too tough for their parents to handle, 
Schumacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The YGC was established by the Orange County Probation Department as an open 
facility -- a back door in each detention unit is always left open -- aimed at 
rehabilitating them with education and counseling programs. 
</P>
<P>
The law then permitted runaways, truants and any youth deemed incorrigible to 
be incarcerated, Schumacher said. There were far more girls than boys, since 
most runaways were girls, and they were kept there 6 months to a year, then 
released whenever it was determined that they had been rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, there were no fences around the grounds and the newly arrived wards 
felt no compulsion to stick around, he said. Eventually a fence was erected, 
not to keep the inmates in but to keep out vagrants who had lived on the site 
for years and still loitered near the dumpsters. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher remembers that in those days officials would strictly enforce state 
hair regulations. Boy's locks could be no more than 2 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
"The flower children hated that," he said. "We'd often lose a couple before the 
weekly Thursday night visit from the barber." 
</P>
<P>
While the task of the YGC has remained the same over the years, it has been 
made more difficult because of changes in the system -- changes that YGC 
officials say render many of their programs less effective. 
</P>
<P>
The key factor was the passage in 1977 of a law requiring determinant 
sentencing for juvenile offenders. Fixed sentences meant that juvenile 
authorities no longer had as much leeway in deciding when a ward should be 
released. Sentences at the YGC now average 33 days. 
</P>
<P>
And public attitudes about the merits of rehabilitation have shifted. 
</P>
<P>
Society now wants foremost to punish juvenile lawbreakers, and at the least get 
them off the streets, according to criminologists and others involved in the 
juvenile justice system. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing is the pendulum of public opinion," said Bruce V. Malloy, 
administrator of the Juvenile Justice Commission, a court-appointed group that 
oversees juvenile facilities in the county. "Over a decade or so it has swung 
from a heavy emphasis on treatment to a heavy emphasis on punishment. The 
system has to respond to that." 
</P>
<P>
According to county probation researchers, the proportion of first-time 
offenders committed to a county youth facility rose from 19% in 1982 to 36% in 
1987. And the number probably increased to the 40% to 50% range during 1988, 
said Gwen Kurz, director of research for the Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're locking up kids much more," said Kurz. "But because of that, we may be 
taking away from the limited resources that we have for follow-up (treatment). 
The benefits are questionable." 
</P>
<P>
YGC Director Richard Duckworth agrees: "We spend a lot of our time just 
processing kids in and out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nearly a 100% turnover every month. Our job is to try to identify 
problems as quickly as possible and try to coordinate follow-up treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the growing seriousness of crimes committed by children and young 
adults hardens society's attitudes about whether rehabilitation works. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the teen-agers sent to the YGC are first- or second-time offenders, but 
their crimes include just about everything short of murder: armed robbery, 
assault, prostitution, gang activity, sales and use of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Many youngsters are also far more emotionally disturbed than those of 2 decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more abused, more mentally disturbed; they have more severe 
problems," said Juvenile Justice Commission member Ellen Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
Probation officials say that more than 75% of those who leave the YGC and the 
county's two other juvenile facilities -- Joplin Youth Center in Trabuco Canyon 
and Los Pinos Rehabilitation Camp in Lake Elsinore -- never return. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these youngsters, they say, are scared straight by their first brushes 
with the law. 
</P>
<P>
But experts in the juvenile justice field say that these kinds of youth centers 
generally do not have much success in rehabilitating the more troubled 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"Not unless they are miracle workers," said Arnold Binder, a UC Irvine 
psychology professor who has written extensively about juvenile delinquency. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't get a turnaround in behavior in 30 days. Even simple 
psychiatric treatment for people who have fewer problems than these kids takes 
years. That doesn't deny that some youngsters may benefit from the programs. 
But we've become so disillusioned that we don't even pretend anymore that the 
(prison) system has any rehabilitative effects," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kurz said many juvenile authorities now believe emphasis should be placed on 
identifying problem youths and intervening at an early stage. 
</P>
<P>
"We can identify 95% of these problem kids the first time they are referred to 
us and the rest by the second time we see them," Kurz said. "We need to focus 
our attention on the intake process. I feel strongly that we can work with 
these kids in the community rather than extend their sentences and have them 
come back and back." 
</P>
<P>
Despite problems in the system, officials still believe the YGC and its 
programs can work. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters are assigned to one of five units, or pods, each of which houses 
25. Within each unit, several bedrooms are grouped around a common meeting 
area. One of the units is co-ed -- older girls are grouped with younger boys. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the institution-gray carpets and smudged pink walls, the units are more 
like large dorms than a prison and each has a television and video cassette 
recorder, among other diversions. 
</P>
<P>
The units also have their own mascot (dogs are popular, but there are fish, 
too) as well as color-coded uniforms (yellow, brown, red, blue and green, worn 
in the universal kid attire of T-shirts, sweat shirts and blue jeans.) 
</P>
<P>
While the YGC is considered an open facility, the youngsters are monitored at 
all times and their days are rigorously regulated. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, one of the county wards will walk away, but most have learned that 
it is easier to get the time over with. 
</P>
<P>
Wards spend about 6 hours each day in classes at the Rio Contigua School, 
located on the grounds. Each unit has a deputy probation counselor who conducts 
a weekly group session. Counselors also meet regularly with individual wards. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are alcohol and drug abuse counseling, image awareness and 
decision-making sessions, and parenting and human sexuality counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The wards also receive work assignments in the laundry and kitchen, but also 
might be assigned to prune the orange and peach trees on the spacious grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say there must be a much higher public awareness of the benefits of 
programs aimed at rehabilitating youthful offenders. Because of the constraints 
placed on the system, the availability of those programs will have to depend 
more and more on the contributions from private groups and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wilcox: "We are going to have to depend on private sector funding, that is 
the only hope." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added: "Juvenile delinquents are a hard sell when it comes to fund 
raising. The kid who stole a car and stabbed somebody doesn't really get a lot 
of identification from others." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, not all of those who need help will be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be realistic," said Malloy. "We can't save everybody and help those 
who don't want to be helped. But we can try to identify those kids who will 
benefit the most and take a personal interest in them. We can look for what 
they are good at and what they can be a success at. The Probation Department 
can be a rather human part of a cold system." 
</P>
<P>
For Joe, the center has meant a respite from the more restrictive confines of 
Juvenile Hall and the violence of the streets. But he is still uncertain of his 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more freedom here than in the (Juvenile) hall and being here helps me 
to stay clean," he said. "But it's like a vacation. I'm getting my strength 
back for when I get back to reality outside."

<TEXT>
<P>
A German tourist bicycling from San Clemente to San Francisco sought Seal Beach 
police help Sunday to look for his female companion after the two became 
separated along the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Erich Griesboeck, 49, of West Germany was bicycling north on PCH on Saturday 
when he and Anke Beate Pahl, 33, became separated, police dispatcher Beth 
Clarke said. Pahl was driving a white, 1979 Ford pickup with a brown stripe and 
a bike rack, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Foul play is not suspected, but police are attempting to re-unite the pair. 
</P>
<P>
Pahl, who speaks English, is 5 feet, 6 inches tall, 100 pounds, with long 
blonde hair, worn in braids, Clarke said. She also has a Husky dog with her. 
</P>
<P>
Griesboeck, who speaks little English, may have been separated from Pahl near 
Warner Avenue on northbound Pacific Coast Highway, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information on the the whereabouts of Pahl is asked to contact the 
Seal Beach Police Department at (213) 431-2541.

HOUSTON ZOO ADOPTS EPILEPTIC SEA LION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An epileptic sea lion nursed back to health at the Marine Mammal Center here 
has become a resident of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Carly, a 5-year-old sea lion, had trouble finding a home because her illness 
requires daily medication, but she recently was adopted by the Houston Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
David Ruhter, curator of mammals at the Texas zoo, said he picked Carly to be 
an attraction at the new $400,000 McGovern Mammal Marina because she is 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the animals that were offered to us were biters and didn't like 
people at all," Ruhter said. 
</P>
<P>
Carly was stranded on a San Diego beach in 1984 and was sent to an animal 
behavior laboratory at UC Santa Cruz, where she developed epilepsy, according 
to Judi Jones, Carly's handler. 
</P>
<P>
The sea lion was nursed back to functional good health at Friends of the Sea 
Lion's Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach.

</P>
<P>
TWO OFFICERS BEATEN; SUSPECT SHOT IN ARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Anaheim police officers were injured when a man they were trying to arrest 
grabbed a baton from one of them and beat them both about the head, authorities 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The man, Joseph Harry Peterson, 29, of Anaheim, was finally subdued after being 
shot in the arm by one of the officers, according to Police Sgt. Chet Barry. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred about 10:40 p.m. Saturday when police responded to a 
report that a man was trying to steal a motorcycle on West Ball Road, Barry 
said. When officers arrived, they were told that the man had fled and broken 
into an apartment in the 2800 block of West Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
Two officers entered the apartment and found Peterson, who had removed his 
clothing and put on a bathrobe that belonged to a resident of the apartment. As 
they tried to arrest him, Peterson began to struggle, and wrested away one of 
the officers' batons, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson allegedly struck both officers several times on the head with the 
baton. Barry said one of the officers drew his gun and, after ordering Peterson 
to drop the baton, fired once, hitting Peterson's right arm, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Other officers arrived at the scene and Peterson was taken into custody. He is 
in satisfactory condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he is being 
held in the jail ward on suspicion of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, 
Barry and hospital personnel said. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers were treated and released at nearby hospitals, Barry said.

TRABUCO HILLS COACH IS NO STRANGER TO HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After its 70-68 upset of third-seeded Savanna in the Southern Section 3-A 
playoffs Friday night, Trabuco Hills boys' basketball team is a much 
talked-about squad. The centerpiece of the team, of course, is 6-foot-10 center 
Rick Swanwick, who is averaging 20.6 points and 13.6 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
But how many remember that Trabuco Hills Coach Rainer Wulf was a much 
talked-about player himself -- at Bishop Amat? 
</P>
<P>
Wulf and his longtime friend, current Bishop Amat Coach Alex Acosta, were 
25-points-per-game players for the Lancers in 1978 and all-Southern Section 
choices as seniors. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, Wulf and Acosta, who attended kindergarten together in 
Monterey Park, were two of the hottest hot shots around when they were growing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Boenker, Trabuco Hills assistant, can attest to it. Boenker coached Wulf 
and Acosta from 1972-75 on the Monterey Park Monarchs, an all-star traveling 
team of youths. 
</P>
<P>
"Rainer and Alex played for me from their sixth to eighth grades," Boenker 
said. "In the three years with them, we went 40-12, 58-8, and 64-19." 
</P>
<P>
According to Boenker, Acosta, who was 5-10 in the eighth grade, was the best 
grade school player in the state. Wulf, who was 5-2 in eighth grade, was a 
talented supporting player. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd shoot at this gym from 10 in the morning until 10 at night," Wulf said. 
"We had a good rivalry between us, though he was a much better player than I 
was -- until I started to grow." 
</P>
<P>
By his senior year, Wulf had grown to 6-6, while Acosta had stopped growing at 
6-1, and the two led Bishop Amat to the Southern Section quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
"When I finally beat him (in one-on-one) basketball my senior year, it was kind 
of a milestone for me," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
After Bishop Amat, Wulf and Acosta joined forces at Citrus College, leading the 
school to the state playoffs their freshman year. At that time, Wulf became 
Citrus' leading scorer, averaging 18 points a game. Acosta played point guard. 
</P>
<P>
After two years at Citrus, the two went their separate ways. Acosta went to the 
University of Redlands and Wulf to UC Irvine. At Irvine, Wulf was a two-year 
starter at small forward, supporting All-American Kevin Magee. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his second year as Trabuco Hills coach, Wulf has led the Mustangs to the 
Southern Section quarterfinals for the first time since the school opened in 
September of 1985. The Mustangs (19-6) will play Estancia (21-5) Wednesday at 
Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Acosta also has coached his team to the quarterfinals, though 
Bishop Amat plays in Division 4-A. Bishop Amat (16-9) will play Barstow (22-3) 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
If it were possible, would Wulf want to play Acosta's team? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, some day down the road maybe," Wulf said. "It would be fun to look down 
at the end of the other bench and see your best friend . . . I wouldn't mind 
meeting him this year as a matter of fact, having a 6-10 center." 
</P>
<P>
Add Wulf: Although few of the Trabuco Hills players know of Wulf's background, 
Boenker said Wulf is still an impressive shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids don't ask too much about (Wulf's background), and we sort of keep it 
low key," Boenker said. "They gotta know he was good once upon a time when they 
watch him in practice making six or eight shots in a row from the three-point 
line. Oh yeah, he can play basketball. He can definitely still play 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Dial D for Destiny: Marty Breen, the Mater Dei girls' soccer coach, says he has 
"a team of destiny." The Monarchs, second-seeded in the Southern Section 3-A, 
are having the best season in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, 20-4-2 overall, opened their season by placing second to Mission 
Viejo in the prestigious Ocean View tournament in December. According to Breen, 
the team suffered a bit of a slump in midseason, but is back in stride again. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching soccer since 1974, on every level," Breen said. "And I have 
never had a team with such a consistency and such an energy level as this one. 
In the last four weeks, they've played with a higher intensity, a higher level, 
than they did at the (Ocean View) tournament. And, they're playing smart 
soccer." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei will play host to Long Beach Wilson (17-4-1) in Wednesday's second 
round. "The girls are really psyched up for this one," Breen said. "Mater Dei 
has never advanced past the second round." 
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga, a four-year starter, sweeper Saule Sadunas and 
defender A.J. West lead Mater Dei's tenacious defense. Friday, in a first-round 
match against Trabuco Hills, West was asked to guard Trabuco Hills' Linda 
Lunceford, who has scored 25 goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
Lunceford, who as a sophomore last year at Esperanza was a first-team 
all-Southern Section player, is one of the county's leading scorers this 
season, with 25 goals. But, closely guarded by West, Lunceford did not score 
and managed only two shots on goal, according to Breen. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps West knows Lunceford's moves. During the off-season, the two play on 
the same club team near Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Ouch! Sunny Hills goalkeeper Erica Gugler finished her high school soccer 
career in a painful way. Not only were the Lancers eliminated by La Quinta, 
3-1, in Friday's first round, but Gugler had to leave the game just 13 minutes 
into the first half after she dislocated her left shoulder while diving to stop 
a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I was diving to stop a pass-back from our center half," Gugler said. "I dove 
and fell on my elbow, and the shoulder just popped out. I had the ball right in 
my hand and I tried to get it, but she (La Quinta forward Cheryl Jones) just 
went around me and scored. I was just down on the ground screaming." 
</P>
<P>
The injury isn't uncommon for Gugler, who said she has had problems with loose 
knee and shoulder joints since she was in seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an inherited disorder," Gugler said. "My joints have popped out before. 
My knees have popped out a lot, my right shoulder popped out two days ago. I 
don't know why, but my joints just seem to do that. Doctors say they're too 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
Gugler, who said arthroscopic surgery on both knees three years ago did little 
to help her problem, relies on several hours of physical therapy a week to 
stabilize the muscles around the joints. Even so, she said Friday's match was 
probably her last. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no more soccer," Gugler, a senior, said. "My body just can't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Add Sunny Hills: Gugler's injury may have been almost as painful for Lancer 
Coach Kenn Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to die," Gordon said. "We were playing so awesome." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Gugler was a problem. The Lancers' back-up goalie, Suzie Bruckman, 
graduated three weeks ago, at mid-term. Sunny Hills didn't have a second 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked around and looked at my sophomore all-Southern Section player 
(Shannan Brown)," Gordon said. "I says, 'Nan, you're going to play goalie. Go 
get a shirt and put it on.' She just looks at me and says, 'But I've never 
played goalie.' And I said, 'You're the best athlete I have. Get in there, 
lady.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brown played impressively, but allowed two of the three goals scored by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"Nan made 11 saves, she played an awesome game, just awesome," Gordon said. 
"But it just wasn't in the cards for us, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Here today, gone to Maui: Woodbridge boys' basketball coach Bill Shannon isn't 
used to having a whole lot of free time in the middle of February. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon coached Woodbridge and Adam Keefe to a Southern Section 2-A 
championship in 1987, and to the 2-A final in 1988, is usually right in the 
thick of things about this time of year. But having been eliminated in the 
first round by Cypress last Wednesday, well, the Warriors have some free time 
on their hands. 
</P>
<P>
What's a coach to do? 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I are going to Maui," Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
And the Warrior players? 
</P>
<P>
"I had to force them to take some days off," he said. "They wanted to get right 
back in the gym and get ready for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bob Ickes, Mater Dei's baseball coach for the past 14 years, has been named 
1989 Baseball Coach of the Year by the California Coaches Assn. and will be 
honored at a banquet in Walnut Creek March 17. Ickes has posted a 224-109-8 
record and won the Southern Section's 4-A division title in 1980. His 1985 team 
was 24-2 and ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today for most of the season. . 
. . Mike Moore, assistant basketball coach at Cypress, recently won $4,100 on 
the television game show, "Hollywood Squares."

'VERY LOVABLE' JEAN COCTEAU REMEMBERED

<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth Anger, best known for telling no-holds-barred tales of Tinseltown's 
seamier scandals in his books "Hollywood Babylon" and "Hollywood Babylon II," 
showed a kinder, gentler side Friday as he paid homage to Jean Cocteau. 
</P>

The French poet, artist, film maker and choreographer was "a very lovable man," 
Anger told a luncheon audience of about 40. His talk was part of the Cocteau 
Centenary Festival at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Anger's fascination with Cocteau was sparked when he was growing up in Santa 
Monica. His mother took him to a screening of the artist's 1930 film "The Blood 
of a Poet," which was paired with Luis Bunuel's 1924 Surrealist masterpiece "Un 
Chien Andalou" ("An Andalusian Dog"). 
</P>
<P>
The budding film maker said he remembers telling himself, "I can make something 
like that," and he began to make short films with the family's 16-millimeter 
home-movie camera. At 15, as a student at Beverly Hills High School, Anger 
refused to go to the funeral of an uncle he disliked -- "My first act of 
independence," he recalled. Finding himself alone in the house for 3 days, 
Anger invited some friends over and made "Fireworks," a short film inspired by 
"The Blood of a Poet." 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, he heard of a festival in France of film maudit -- "damned films" -- 
and entered "Fireworks." To Anger's surprise, he received a personal letter 
praising the film from Cocteau, who was on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea that Cocteau had anything to do" with the festival, Anger said 
Friday. "Fireworks" won first prize in the 1949 Biarritz festival's "poetic 
film" category and Anger was invited to Paris to show his films. 
</P>
<P>
Anger, who had studied French in high school and read much of Cocteau's poetry, 
went to Paris against the wishes of his parents -- but with the blessing and 
financial support of his grandmother, an artist who had been a costume mistress 
in silent films. The star-struck teen showed his films to a private audience 
that included Cocteau, Jean Genet and other writers and artists. 
</P>
<P>
The films, which often contained violent and disturbing imagery, upset 
Surrealist painter Leonor Fini "quite a bit," but Anger said Cocteau understood 
the young film maker's "need to shock." 
</P>
<P>
Anger later went to a performance of Cocteau's 1946 ballet "La Jeune Homme et 
la Mort," and was transfixed by the work. "I told Cocteau this would make a 
wonderful movie," Anger recalled, and to his surprise he was given the film 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, he made a 20-minute black-and-white film of the ballet, shot in a 
garden on a cold morning with the performers' breath coming out in clouds of 
steam. "We needed the space, and we didn't have the money to rent a theater," 
Anger explained. 
</P>
<P>
It was Anger's intent to make a color version of the film, but he never 
received the backing. "It's been to my eternal regret that I didn't try harder 
and come back to the U.S. to get some sponsors," Anger said. The 
black-and-white film remains the only record of the ballet's original 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Anger stayed in Paris for 12 years, working at the Cinematheque Francaise, and 
had contact with Cocteau a number of times before the Frenchman's death in 
1963. In 1954, while temporarily back in the United States for his mother's 
funeral, Anger made "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" and dedicated it to 
Cocteau. It was Cocteau who suggested that Anger use Leos Janacek's "Slavonic 
Mass" as music for the film. 
</P>
<P>
The film maker recalled attending a performance of Stravinsky's oratorio 
"Oedipus Rex," which Cocteau narrated and Stravinsky conducted. Cocteau arrived 
in a black tuxedo -- with a jacket made of fluffy black Angora. "He looked like 
a very exotic pussycat," Anger recalled. "I noticed when Stravinsky saw this 
outfit, he tensed up." 
</P>
<P>
During the performance, Cocteau further annoyed the maestro when he began to 
twirl his glasses in counterpoint to the music. "Cocteau did catch his eye and 
stop," Anger said. 
</P>
<P>
When Anger wanted to visit Egypt, it was Cocteau who arranged for his hosts, 
and later the two discussed Anger's hopes of making a film there. They shared 
an interest in mythology, Anger's sparked by his grandmother, who taught him 
about ancient myths "when she wasn't telling me some gossip about the silent 
days of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cocteau considered himself a Parisian first, Anger characterized him 
as an Egyptian. "There was something of an old Pharaoh about him," Anger said. 
"His mysticism was the mysticism of ancient Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
Anger returned to the United States and created such '60s underground films as 
the influential "Scorpio Rising" (1964) and "Psychedelirium" (1969). "Every 
once in a while, I write a book on Hollywood scandals to make some money," 
Anger said, provoking chuckles from the audience, but he said he thinks of 
himself as a film maker first. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of his talk, titled "Cocteau and the Magic Mirror," Anger 
displayed a treasured possession given him by Cocteau, who called it a "magic 
mirror." Slightly convex, the rectangular mirror condenses a wide vista into a 
small frame and is of the type often used by landscape artists. Anger said he 
has taken the mirror to Egypt, India, Iceland and other places around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The eye takes in too much," Anger said. But with the mirror, "suddenly, it is 
contained within a frame." 
</P>
<P>
Anger said of Cocteau: "He wasn't a snob. He wasn't an elitist." He took an 
equal interest in all people -- even a high school kid from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful for that," Anger said, "and I'm very grateful that he is 
remembered on this planet."

Chinese police have raided an exhibition of nude paintings influenced by 
Tibetan Buddhism and shown to a shocked Beijing public, artists said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A security van with flashing lights rushed to the Beijing Artists Gallery on 
Saturday evening. Uniformed policemen confiscated six paintings and questioned 
artist Cao Yong, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit had been open for 5 days and was being packed up when police 
arrived. The raid followed the closing of several nude photographic exhibitions 
in the eastern city of Nanking recently. 
</P>
<P>
Artists said the authorities wanted to put the brakes on a new wave of artistic 
freedom that is taking China by storm. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, officials from the legal department of Beijing's cultural 
office visited Cao's exhibition to tell him that members of the public had 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
One painting shows a heap of naked women below Buddhist-monklike figures and 
another depicts a woman dragging two men by their genitalia out of a fire. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Cao, 26, an ethnic Han Chinese -- had spent a lot of time in Tibet 
and was sympathetic to the Himalayan region's culture and religion. 
</P>
<P>
"The authorities are still not sure of the dividing line between art and 
pornography in China," said one avant-garde artist. 
</P>
<P>
Artists won a major cultural battle last month, opening a controversial 
exhibition of nude paintings in Beijing's national art gallery. Huge crowds 
flocked to see it. 
</P>
<P>
The show was followed this month by a major exhibition of avant-garde art that 
was closed temporarily after the artists angered the authorities with 
performances of "action art."
