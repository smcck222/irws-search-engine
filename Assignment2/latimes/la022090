FOR-PROFIT JAILS, ONCE LOVED, NOW ON SHAKY GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three years ago, when entrepreneur Ernie Wright studied the county's escalating 
jail overcrowding, he devised a way to help county officials tackle the problem 
and make a profit, too. 
</P>
<P>
Wright offered to take some of the offenders off the county's hands by placing 
them into his San Diego work-furlough facility: a private jail where inmates, 
in essence, pay Wright to be incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, judges have sent a steady stream of convicts to Wright, keeping 
his 87-bed facility full and his bank account in the black. But now, private 
jailers such as Wright are concerned that their fledgling industry may soon go 
bust. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller sent a letter to the county's judges 
opposing the commitment of any criminal defendant to a private work-furlough 
facility. According to Miller, sending offenders to such places, which are not 
under contract with the county, is a violation of state penal codes. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and a handful of the county's other private jailers say they have 
repeatedly asked the county for a contract to keep them in business, but have 
had their requests denied. County officials say such agreements with private 
operators means assuming responsibility for the outfits without being able to 
adequately supervise them. 
</P>
<P>
But some operators say they're being unfairly dismissed, and they criticize 
both county officials and the district attorney for not trying to save a 
program that is helping the county solve its jail woes. 
</P>
<P>
When introduced, many judges enthusiastically welcomed private work-furlough 
centers such as Wright's, because, like their public counterparts, they allow 
the offender to maintain a job, yet still withhold freedom. Inmates can leave 
only to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
However, concerns about lack of supervision and other problems in part spurred 
the state Board of Corrections to ask the attorney general whether the courts 
had the authority to direct a person convicted of a crime to a private facility 
operating without a county contract. Last month, Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp 
issued his opinion, saying that such an act was indeed a violation of state 
penal codes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote my letter because the attorney general's opinion was brought to my 
attention and I felt that the judges here ought to know about it," Dist. Atty. 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates say private work-furlough programs avoid using the county's scarce 
supply of jail beds for minor-league criminals -- and that such beds should be 
used instead to accommodate a burgeoning hard-core criminal population. 
</P>
<P>
"If this county had adequate jail space, (the district attorney) might have a 
small argument," Wright said. "But with the vast overcrowding that the county 
is facing, the fact that the DA's office is opposing all private work-furlough 
centers is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are offering a viable alternative right in front of the county 
officials and they're acting like the proverbial ostrich that sticks its head 
in the sand," he said. "They're not doing a damn thing to find alternatives to 
ease our jail crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Woodley, owner and operator of Mid-City Work Furlough, added: "The most 
important thing to keep in mind is that we are providing a quality product that 
doesn't cost the taxpayers a single dime. I think the supervisors need to 
contract with the providers or the law needs to be changed." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's letter has received mixed reviews from judges who say 
they clearly recognize the benefits provided by private work-furlough programs, 
but are concerned about violating state penal codes. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general's opinion is fairly well-reasoned, and it clearly 
indicates that the private work furloughs don't comply with the penal codes in 
that they are not administered by a work-furlough director who reports to the 
Board of Supervisors," said Judge Ronald Prager of the North County Superior 
Court. "Therefore, they're not required to meet health standards, building 
standards, etc., that are pertinent to the proper maintenance of the facilities 
and proper care of the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general's opinions do not have the force of law, but they 
certainly can be persuasive," Prager said, "and I am persuaded by his 
arguments." 
</P>
<P>
But Judge E. Mac Amos, presiding judge of the San Diego Municipal Court, says 
private work-furlough facilities are needed to address jail overcrowding and 
that there is room for interpretation in the recent opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"In a case where there is a minimum mandatory period of custody, meaning that 
custody is required, the opinion pretty much rules out the option of sending 
individuals to private work furlough," Amos said. 
</P>
<P>
But when custody is not required, and the judge has the option of putting an 
individual on probation, Amos believes private work furlough can still be used. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear that the opinion does not allow this to occur either," he 
said, "but I believe a judge has the discretion to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Amos says such confusion can be resolved if the county provides a contract to 
the private operators. Wright couldn't agree more. He acknowledges that he 
would like to do business with the county and offer his jail services for a "a 
hefty contract," but says he'll settle for much less. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be glad just to get a contract of recognition, something from the county 
that says they recognize us as a service provider," Wright said. "Anything, 
really -- just something to get us around this technicality." 
</P>
<P>
Private jailers say they don't need a substantial financial contract to stay in 
business -- they can make a profit by charging offenders room and board. Wright 
charges his "residents" $21 a day or $630 a month for two meals a day and a 
place to stay. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials say that offering a contract of any sort to a private 
jailer will make the county accountable for any improprieties that occur. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment you talk contract you bring in the issue of liability," said Cecil 
Steppe, the county's chief probation officer, who would be responsible for 
overseeing the private facilities if the county were to do business with them. 
"If something goes wrong in one of those facilities, they're going to sue the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not opposed to private work furloughs," Steppe said. "But if there are no 
dollars to allow me to do an adequate job, then I'm going to recommend against 
it because the liability factor is far too great." 
</P>
<P>
In October, when Wright went before the Board of Supervisors and asked for a 
contract, Steppe informed the board that he would need more than $400,000 to 
adequately supervise a private facility comparable to Wright's Pacific 
Furlough. Such an expenditure would cover items such as the hiring of 10 
employees, primarily probation officers and clerks, a van, a mobile radio and a 
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
With the county suffering from fiscal problems, supervisors declined to award a 
contract to Wright. 
</P>
<P>
Private operators insist that Steppe's estimates are "grossly inflated," and 
even some judges say such estimates "seem awfully high." 
</P>
<P>
While Wright acknowledges there are some inadequate private facilities, he says 
the district attorney's ruling punishes the private jail industry across the 
board -- including the legitimate operators. Most judges regard Pacific 
Furlough as a sound operation; it is also one of the few that meets state 
Department of Corrections standards and has received a conditional use permit 
from the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Using a good private work furlough, Wright promises, can save county taxpayers 
much money. According to David Janssen, the county's assistant chief 
administrative officer, it costs taxpayers $40 a day to house one inmate in a 
county jail. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you use that figure, which we believe is low, we house 85 residents, 
365 days a year," Wright said. "If you multiply that by $40 a day . . . our 
facility alone is saving the county $1.2 million a year." 
</P>
<P>
There are 225 to 250 private work-furlough beds in the county, he said, which 
could save the county nearly $4 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
"You can send someone to a place where they can maintain their job, take care 
of their family and pay back society, or you can send them to an overcrowded 
jail where you have riots practically every week," Wright said. "I think the 
right choice is fairly obvious." 
</P>
<P>
Wright quickly dismisses concerns about possible inmate abuse at his facility. 
His security staff is instructed specifically not to confront or restrain an 
uncooperative resident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If a resident wants to violate curfew and just walks out we do not restrain 
him," Wright said. "We just write him up, informing the judge that he is 
violating the conditions set for him, and he's off to jail." But as a 
safeguard, Wright added, he has a $1-million liability insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Furlough Facility is supervised by a 17-member security staff. The 
guards carefully monitor a "resident's" work schedule to verify that the 
individual is actually reporting to work, Wright said. Inmates and their 
possessions are searched routinely, and they are also subject to random drug 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials remain skeptical. In the past there have been reports 
about drug use in the facilities and of guards showing favoritism toward 
inmates. Safety and sanitation standards have also proved inadequate at times. 
</P>
<P>
County officials also question the private jailers' claims that they can save 
the county millions of dollars and ease jail crowding. In many cases, Steppe 
says, the types of offenders sent to private furlough wouldn't be sentenced to 
the county jails in the first place. These days, officials say, only hard-core 
criminals spend time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"Comparing inmates in the county jails to the offenders sent to work furlough 
is like comparing apples and oranges," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments infuriate the private jailers. 
</P>
<P>
"The people we take in are tried and convicted people," Wright said. "You're 
telling me that after we spend a lot of time and taxpayers' dollars sending 
police officers out after them and prosecutors to prosecute them . . . we're 
just going to set them free?" 
</P>
<P>
"If that's what they want to do, then I'll get out of this business," he said.

STUDYING AN AREA AWASH IN ALCOHOL; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNITIES: A $100,000 SURVEY SEEKS TO LEARN WHY PACOIMA AND SAN FERNANDO HAVE 
UNUSUALLY HIGH NUMBERS OF DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS AND OTHER ALCOHOL-RELATED 
PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Pollsters began asking northeast San Fernando Valley residents a series of 
carefully crafted questions this week in hopes of painting a detailed picture 
of alcohol use in an area that authorities say has experienced an excessive 
number of alcohol-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacoima-based Northeast Valley Health Corp. received a $100,000 federal 
grant to conduct the alcohol study, which also will analyze drunk driving 
arrests and map sites where alcohol is purchased or consumed publicly. 
</P>
<P>
The agency last week began training volunteers to conduct a telephone poll of 
1,600 households in Pacoima and the city of San Fernando in English and 
Spanish. From the initial group contacted, 400 respondents will be asked to 
take part in lengthier, in-person interviews at their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's designed to find out attitudes, behavior and knowledge related to alcohol 
use and alcohol-related problems," said Marylou Bivian, the agency's research 
project director. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier Flores, who directs the agency's community prevention and recovery 
program, said he is sensitive to concerns that alcohol problems, which exist 
citywide, are being more closely scrutinized in the two heavily Latino 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually believe this area is being singled out for concentrated enforcement 
by the Police Department, and I don't like that," Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
But Flores added that statistics indicate the communities in the northeast 
Valley do have more drunk driving accidents and other alcohol-related problems 
than many other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the area is being targeted unfairly by police, Flores said, "there is 
enough to suggest that we have a big problem" with alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Last month the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division, which 
includes the Pacoima area, led the Valley with 35 drunk driving accidents, said 
Sharyn Gunter, a Police Department analyst. During 1989, the Foothill 
Division's 313 drunk driving accidents were topped only by the West Valley 
Division, which recorded 314. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Division had 2,530 adult drunk driving arrests, including incidents in 
which no collision occurred, in the first 11 months of 1989, second only to the 
Van Nuys Division. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned about alcohol-related problems, city officials in recent months have 
tried to close or curtail sales at Pacoima-area bars and liquor stores, which 
they claim have contributed to drinking problems. 
</P>
<P>
The new survey is expected to help determine whether cultural factors, 
unfamiliarity with drinking laws and job stress are linked to the community's 
drinking problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not racist," Juana Mora of UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center said of 
the survey. "I don't want to perpetuate stereotypes, but I think the Latinos, 
for whatever reasons, are drinking more heavily, especially the male 
population." 
</P>
<P>
Mora said she has researched Latino drinking patterns for the past 10 years. 
She reviewed Northeast Valley Health Corp.'s grant application for the alcohol 
study while employed by the Los Angeles County Office of Alcohol Programs. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why I recommended it for funding is that it has strong policy 
implications," Mora said. "It can be used to help public officials reduce the 
availability of alcohol in that community. 
</P>
<P>
"We do have some research that shows that if you reduce the availability, you 
can reduce the consumption, even more than education programs would. 
Information doesn't necessarily change behavior. But if you impact the 
environment, that does tend to change behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Mora said that people, when surveyed, typically under-report the amount of 
drinking they do, and pollsters take that into account. 
</P>
<P>
Project coordinator Bivian said survey questions were designed to ask 
respondents about general problems in their community before alcohol issues are 
addressed, usually in an indirect manner. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope to find out whether alcohol abuse is more prevalent among 
adults living alone or with a family, among newcomers or longtime residents, 
among bilingual Latinos or those who speak only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers also will look for ties between alcohol use and health ailments or 
domestic problems such as spousal or child abuse, even though the respondents 
might not always admit to experiencing such difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
After the study is completed in June, health agency members plan to distribute 
the findings to public officials and to use them to develop new prevention 
programs. The Northeast Valley Health Corp., funded by county, state and 
federal grants, serves about 20,000 primarily low-income residents each month. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders are also awaiting results of the study. "I think the 
information is going to be valuable to affirm certain concerns we have," said 
Everto Ruiz, a lifelong San Fernando resident and a member of the Latino 
Coalition on Alcohol Issues of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz, who is acting Chicano studies department chairman at Cal State 
Northridge, said the results might help leaders curb widespread outdoor 
advertising for alcoholic beverages in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's enough to hope and pray that everybody's going to live 
without destructive practices," he said. "We have to try to have a community 
that doesn't tolerate marketing practices that take advantage of people or are 
overwhelming in directing people toward negative ways of life."

<P>
Much is being neglected in current discussion about which legislator's district 
is to be hit by reductions in military bases or defense contracts. The deeper 
question is speeding up conversion of military facilities to peaceful uses. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities for conversion are even broader than usually seen. They do 
involve planning by corporations and labor unions but also by local and 
national governments. They need to include both substitute use of facilities 
and alternate employment for employees. 
</P>
<P>
Why not move "from submarines to subways"? Why not produce more mass-transit 
systems, schoolrooms, low-cost housing, health care facilities? To stop 
depletion of natural resources, why not give less emphasis to producing 
material goods and more to non-material services? Why not employ more people as 
teachers, counselors, musicians, forest rangers? Conversion then becomes a 
welcome opportunity to increase the quality of our total lives.

ARLETA GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I find it frustrating and contradictory that while you report of the 
self-indulgences of the Department of Water and Power at the expense of its 
utility customers (Part B, "Only in L.A.," Feb. 9), a manager in the DWP's 
property division is trying to persuade us that because of necessary cutbacks, 
the DWP would like to give the boot to Metro Farms' Arleta Community Gardens 
retired senior citizens so the DWP can lease the club's garden area to a 
commercial nursery. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 15 years we have maintained gardens under the transmission lines 
and have been an asset to the community. 
</P>
<P>
We pay for the water that we use, share the vegetables that we grow and 
practice conservation of our resources through composting, mulching and organic 
gardening. The department needs to more closely scrutinize and reassess its 
sense of values and be more sensitive to its own energy conservation and to the 
needs of its community.

KARABAKH CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a rare pleasure when Turks and Armenians agree on something. That is why 
it was disappointing to read the letter (Feb. 5) by Turkish Assembly Vice 
President Bulent Basol, who wrote that the Karabakh crisis "is not a religious 
war as Armenians would like the public to believe." Armenians agree that it is 
not a religious war. 
</P>
<P>
Why a Turkish organization takes a point of agreement on a sensitive topic and 
turns it into a fabricated disagreement is an important question which demands 
careful scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a war for land," writes Basol. This, too, Armenians agree with -- 
except their explanation would include the fact that Armenians had been living 
there for 1,200 years before the Turks first invaded and occupied the area. 
Basol asserts that Karabakh "has never been ruled" by Armenians, that they 
"were sent there" by the Russians to augment the "Christian population of this 
Muslim-dominated" region. This not only demonstrates gross ignorance of 
history, but, more seriously, exposes the Turkish Assembly's own desire to 
inject religious overtones. 
</P>
<P>
"Armenians started it," writes Basol. This is true if, rather than centuries of 
oppression by Turkish invaders and their descendants, we take as a starting 
point the massive Armenian demonstrations in February, 1988. The urge today to 
unite Karabakh with Armenia is the direct result of economic and cultural 
discrimination. Azeri authorities have been trying to keep the Armenians 
economically impoverished and culturally suppressed in order to assimilate them 
or drive them out. The same policy has succeeded in nearby Nakhicheven: In 1921 
the Armenian population there was 40%; today, virtually 0%. The policy is a 
continuing threat in Karabakh: In 1921 Armenians were 95%; today, 83%. This is 
a human-rights case. And the only solution, it seems, is a boundary change 
based on compromise.

OUT OF AFRICA: MORE HYPOCRISY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rapid changes leading toward democracy in South Africa and the end of 
colonialism on the continent with Namibia's forthcoming independence, while 
important and laudable developments, also expose the rest of Africa to a more 
rigorous examination of its own political problems. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, it has been convenient for other African nations to divert attention 
from their own failures with outcries against South Africa and its system of 
apartheid. The international institutions, including the Organization of 
African Unity, and even the United Nations itself, have found it easier to 
criticize South Africa than to address grievous disputes among and within the 
nations of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is a sad truth that most African nations have not been well served by 
their own leaders in the post-colonial period. Corruption has eaten at the 
national fabric. Mobutu Sese Seko has exploited the presidency of Zaire to 
become one of the world's richest men. Governments have been quick to condemn 
racism in South Africa while remaining silent on tribalism that, in Burundi 
alone, has proven a far more deadly toxin than apartheid. Democracy is 
virtually unknown. Ideology-driven socialist schemes have been perpetuated 
years after being proven failures. The press is, without exception, closely 
controlled, and when it raises its voice to expose official corruption, as in 
Zimbabwe, it is punished, not praised. 
</P>
<P>
The weakness of the Organization of African Unity reflects a complicity among 
the national regimes that cripples the functions of statesmanship and 
peacemaking. The most venturesome efforts to resolve problems have come outside 
the OAU, including Mobutu's moves to end the warfare in Angola, and the support 
of independence for Namibia reinforced by the front-line states, including 
Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana. The U.N. Economic Commission on Africa has 
become an instrument for undermining fundamental economic reforms through the 
zealous leadership of Adebayo Adedeji, its executive secretary, who doesn't 
like what the World Bank and International Monetary Fund experts have proposed. 
No government has raised the issues of freedom, torture, imprisonment of 
political foes and free elections because none meets the standards set by the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness, the desultory record of the African nations has been matched by 
the African policies of the Western democracies, including the United States. 
Washington was the driving force behind an economic reform program developed in 
the U.N. General Assembly. More than 20 nations adopted the new programs, 
usually at great political cost, only to discover that the Americans had 
decided not to provide the aid that had been promised as a reward for the 
reforms. Congress found it cheaper to impose sanctions on South Africa than to 
provide adequate development assistance to struggling nations. Nor has 
nation-building been easy in the wake of colonialism. So American officials 
have justified their generous and forgiving relationship with Mobutu for the 
reason that a united and relatively stable Zaire was worth the cost of 
corruption. That same argument has been made in overlooking the abuses of the 
late Jomo Kenyatta and now Daniel Arap Moi in Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
If Pretoria succeeds in its struggle for a peaceful transition to democracy, it 
will be a model for the people of Africa as striking, tempting and attractive 
as anything that has happened recently in Eastern Europe. But it is by no means 
certain that African governments, too long settled into the comfort of rule by 
edict and bribery, will respond. Nor is there any promise that those responding 
will receive the required resources from the world's democracies, especially 
now that they seem more motivated to support Eastern Europe's new interest in 
market-driven economies. 
</P>
<P>
The West is rushing to provide aid to Eastern Europe to encourage and advance 
the democratic revolution. The need is no less in Africa. Change in South 
Africa already is inspiring demands for change throughout Africa. But that 
change will be fragile and inconclusive at best unless matched by resources to 
accelerate development.

DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the death penalty ("Degraded by a Lust for Death," by William 
J. Wood, Op-Ed Page, Feb. 7) is not only outrageous but also insulting. 
</P>
<P>
How dare you characterize proponents of capital punishment as having a "lust 
for death"? Your sanctimonious opposition doesn't give you the right to slander 
those with whom you disagree! 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Father Wood's hand-wringing discourse adds nothing to the debate 
over capital punishment. I was astounded to read that "our democratic 
experiment is such a failure that we have to resort to legalized killing in 
order to protect ourselves," and that violent crimes "are symptomatic of a very 
dysfunctional society." What utter garbage! We are not to blame for the 
atrocious crimes of people like Robert Alton Harris -- they are responsible for 
their own actions, and deserve to pay the ultimate price for their horrible 
deeds.

Everyone should read the opinions of George F. Will and Alan M. Dershowitz ("Is 
Begging Protected Speech or a Blight on Public Space?" Op-Ed Page, Feb. 1). 
</P>
<P>
Will should remember that this country was founded in large part because of the 
dangerous decision to have "actions feed the anarchic impulse toward violent 
self-help." 
</P>
<P>
Albeit a well-reasoned decision. 1984 is well past and this is a society in 
which the individual is increasingly at the mercy of our bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the world's largest cities, the pace and range of life are, indeed, 
harried and frightening. New York City does resemble a Third World city. In a 
population density like this, it is just as unreasonable to expect not to be 
touched or threatened (how do you outlaw the latter -- one person's threat is 
another person's joke?) as to expect daily life to be free of unpleasant people 
or situations. The courts seem intent on replacing individual discretion and 
common sense with court decisions. This is what happens when bureaucracies make 
rules. 1984, indeed.

Don't expect to see Air Dwayne advertisements on television anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
Former first-round NBA draft pick Dwayne (Pearl) Washington is in the fourth 
and final year of a contract with Avia shoes that will pay him $125,000. But 
Avia isn't receiving quite the exposure it bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than becoming an NBA star after playing at Syracuse, Washington bombed 
with the New Jersey Nets. After being cut by several other teams, an overweight 
Washington has ended up with the San Jose Jammers of the Continental Basketball 
Assn. But his contract says that as long as he is being paid to play, he gets 
his money from Avia. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The Philadelphia 76ers' Charles Barkley has been assessed 114 
technical fouls in his career. In the past 20 years, only two NBA players had 
more. Who were they? 
</P>
<P>
Pie in the sky: The American meal of choice for Yugoslav forward Zarko Paspalj 
of the San Antonio Spurs is pizza, which he says he eats five times a week. 
"Pizza not for everybody," Paspalj says. "But for me, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
Add NBA: The Lakers' Michael Cooper, Barkley, the Boston Celtics' Larry Bird, 
the Indiana Pacers' Chuck Person and the Detroit Pistons' Bill Laimbeer compose 
USA Today's All-Trash-Talking team. 
</P>
<P>
Last add NBA: George Shinn, owner of the Charlotte Hornets, on why he insists 
his coach wear a suit, tie and white shirt: "Look at Doug Moe and Frank Layden. 
They've been consistently the worst-dressed, and how many championships have 
they won?" 
</P>
<P>
Leap of faith: Rick Pitino, University of Kentucky basketball coach, is among 
those who favor having the rim raised to 10 feet 5 inches. "Now, you see 5-7 
guards dunking," Pitino said. "It's too easy to dunk." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting in the wings: Sydney Maree, the South African-born runner who had to 
become an American citizen before he could be an Olympian, is the American 
1,500-meter record-holder (3:29.77). 
</P>
<P>
Of the possibility that apartheid will end and South Africa will rejoin the 
Olympic family, Maree said: "People think I was a fast runner in high school. I 
was just one of many in South Africa. I was probably about No. 100. I think if 
things work out, the excitement will really carry over. We'll see the young 
seizing the moment and showing the world we can have tremendous performances." 
</P>
<P>
No Big A, please: If the Raiders return to Oakland, the Coliseum -- home of the 
World Series champion Athletics -- would undergo renovation. Are the Athletics 
worried? General Manager Sandy Alderson told Art Spander of the San Francisco 
Examiner: "One of the things we don't want to create is another Riverfront 
Stadium or Three Rivers Stadium. They're the sort where one seems destined to 
sit behind home plate for football and on the 50-yard line for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Nor do we want to create an Anaheim Stadium, where a crowd of 40,000 gets lost 
in 65,000 seats." 
</P>
<P>
Add Athletics: Club executive Bill Rigney on slugger Jose Canseco: "Canseco is 
still pretty much a kid. But hopefully, he's growing up." 
</P>
<P>
Clutch situation: Philadelphia goalie Pete Peeters said of the struggling 
Flyers: "I've been on worse teams that have been in this situation. I've 
already seen guys going for each other's throats. This is a team where we just 
have to pull together."

Trivia answer: Sam Lacey (148) and Norm Van Lier (136).

FOOTWEAR'S UGLY DUCKLING GROWS UP; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: CLUNKY BIRKENSTOCK SANDALS WERE PART OF THE 1960S COUNTERCULTURE. NOW 
THEIR U.S. DISTRIBUTOR HOPES SOME STYLISH UPDATING WILL BROADEN THEIR MARKET 
APPEAL IN THE 1990S. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NOVATO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Margot Fraser visited her native Germany in 1966, she discovered a pair of 
homely sandals called Birkenstocks that soothed her chronically aching feet. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking that American women would welcome this alternative to the pointy 
footwear fashions of the day, she brought a few pairs back to her home in Santa 
Cruz and began a word-of-mouth campaign. She and her husband soon had to move 
their cars out of the garage and convert it into a warehouse to hold all the 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Birkenstock Footprint Sandals, of which Fraser is owner and president, 
has grown well beyond the garage stage. 
</P>
<P>
The company occupies a 74,000-square-foot office and warehouse complex -- 
double the space of just a year ago -- in an office park in the Marin County 
community of Novato, about 25 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
And far from the few pairs that Fraser ordered for friends via parcel post in 
the old days, her company now imports about 500,000 pairs of sandals and shoes 
annually from the German manufacturer and distributes them to more than 1,000 
retailers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for earthy, clunky, cork-bed shoes that were originally sold in health 
food stores, became part of the counterculture's dress code in the late 1960s 
and over the years have occasionally been denounced by preppie and trendy sets 
alike as Geekenstocks. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to win broader acceptance of the shoe, Fraser, as the sole U.S. 
distributor, has lately encouraged the German manufacturer of Birkenstocks to 
step into livelier styles and colors. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to try to make what was once a hallmark of laid-back hippiedom more 
appealing to increasingly comfort-conscious yuppiedom. 
</P>
<P>
But is the world ready for black patent leather Birkenstocks, set to hit the 
stores this spring? 
</P>
<P>
Fraser believes, quite adamantly, that it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that there is a need out there for more style and color as women look 
for more comfortable shoes to wear on different occasions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the company has gone from 12 earth-tone styles to more than 
125 styles and colors, including purple, fuchsia, forest green and pastels. For 
spring, the company is showing a line of cruise colors, featuring hot pink and 
two-tone sandals. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the company also began using more sophisticated promotion 
techniques, offering gifts with purchases, sprucing up in-store advertising 
with slick promotional materials and shifting from a folksy logo in script to a 
sleek, high-tech symbol with a stylized sandal. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser, a gracious woman who sweeps her long, blonde hair into a bun, realizes 
that the durable sandals and shoes are not at all likely to become the next 
Reebok, Nike or L.A. Gear. But she expects the company's attention to changing 
life styles and needs and consumers' increasing wish for comfort to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
"We've doubled since 1985, and we expect to double again within three years," 
said Fraser, whose English is flawless but heavily accented. 
</P>
<P>
The staff was recently doubled, to 71, in anticipation of a Birkenstock 
boomlet. 
</P>
<P>
For Birkenstock, growth in the United States to date has been steady but 
relatively slow. With the move into more fashionable lines, Fraser said she 
believes that the company is poised for a growth spurt. 
</P>
<P>
For its owner, Birkenstock has been a two-decade learning experience. When she 
began the business, the importing expertise came from her husband, who sold 
cutlery from Germany. (They divorced in 1970; Fraser is now married to a 
psychiatrist, Stephen Schoen.) 
</P>
<P>
She incorporated the U.S. distributorship in 1972 and, with one part-time 
employee, opened a small office in San Rafael above a health food store, where 
the rent was $25 a month. 
</P>
<P>
At first, mainstream shoe retailers reacted skeptically, so Fraser sold the 
sandals in health food stores. Demand grew, largely because of Fraser's own 
zeal in touting the product's qualities. 
</P>
<P>
She knew from experience. The sandals she bought in Germany solved longtime 
foot problems that had plagued Fraser in a previous career as a dress designer, 
when she would spend all day on her feet draping fabric on dress forms. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser now owns 25 pairs, one of which dates to 1968 and is finally ready for 
"retirement." And today, as in the past, much of the company's business comes 
from customers with foot problems whose doctors recommend the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, other retailers decided that the strange-looking footwear had merit. 
They tend to be a loyal bunch. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Suechting Sr., owner of 50 Track 'n Trail shoe stores across the country, 
considers Birkenstocks the "anchor of our sandal market." He said the chain, 
which started with two stores 10 years ago, is starting to carry more 
fashionable Birkenstock lines, although most of his customers still seek out 
the original cork footbed and suede upper that made the shoe famous. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Lanning, owner of five Birkenstock stores in the Los Angeles area, gave 
up fashion modeling to go into the retail business after Birkenstock proved a 
saving grace for her sore feet. 
</P>
<P>
"My feet hurt," said Lanning, a native San Franciscan who in her modeling days 
used to traipse all over the hilly city in high heels. "Birkenstocks helped 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, when she opened her first store, "Birkenstocks were not 
very acceptable in most circles. Today they're more acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cybill Shepherd, who often buys pairs of Birkenstocks as gifts, is said 
to have a wardrobe of them. Harrison Ford, Keith Carradine and Madonna also are 
devotees. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy, status-conscious Los Angeles has been slow to embrace the shoes, 
according to Fraser. "It has been far more difficult to get a foothold in 
Southern California," she said. But in the past four years sales in the region 
have doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Even devoted fans give the shoes' appearance mixed reviews. "The ugly, 
wonderful shoes" is how Beverly Ziegler, a former Berkeley resident who now 
wears her sandals in Rochester, N.Y., describes them. Although the sandals are 
not ubiquitous as they were in Berkeley, where they were popularized by 
hippies, she knows a core group of "Granola bar type" Rochester yuppies who 
"sit in their Birkenstocks and heavy wool socks and work at their computers." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, Birkenstock has found pockets of interest in unlikely 
places. Residents of Boise, Idaho, buy the most Birkenstocks per capita. 
Lawrence, Kan., and Lincoln, Neb., are also hotbeds. 
</P>
<P>
At the Novato office, men and women employees pad around in the company's shoes 
and sandals, wearing them with everything from jeans to knit dresses to 
business suits. They call them "Birks." 
</P>
<P>
Birkenstocks are made in Bad Honnef, a village outside Bonn. They feature a 
molded cork-and-rubber "footbed" and suede or leather-like straps that tie or 
buckle. The idea of the footbed is to re-create the feeling of walking in sand. 
Most sell for $50 to $110 (up from $19.95 when Fraser first sold them in this 
country). Sandals account for about 70% of the U.S. business, with the rest 
coming from sales of closed-toe shoes and clogs. 
</P>
<P>
Birkenstock sales are scant compared to the overall U.S. shoe market. In the 12 
months ending August, 1989, 996.4 million pairs of men's, women's and 
children's shoes were sold, according to Footwear Industries of America, a 
trade group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fraser closely guards sales and profit figures ("for competitive 
reasons"), she said the company has never had a money-losing year. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany, the Birkenstock business is run by Karl Birkenstock, whose 
forebear, Johann Adam Birkenstock, made shoes more than 200 years ago. It was 
young Karl's decision when he joined the firm in 1965 at 21 to design and make 
a shoe built for comfort. His grandfather, Konrad, designed the first shoe with 
a contoured soul in 1897. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser usually meets with the Birkenstocks two to three times a year in 
Germany, where she was born in 1929. Retailers regard her as a savvy executive 
with great integrity. The description pleases Fraser, who learned her skills on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have business expertise, so I was playing it by ear," Fraser said of 
the early years. "I had to rely on people from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Being a woman might have worked in her favor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I wasn't taken so seriously at the shoe (industry) shows," she said. "On 
the other hand, maybe it was an edge because people said, 'This company does 
everything differently.' " 
</P>
<P>
Her advice to other women business owners? Get educated. Fraser keeps on her 
toes by attending small-business seminars at Stanford and belonging to an 
executives group that holds monthly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Fraser professes to be relieved that the company did not grow as fast 
as she initially expected because she would not have had the capital to fund 
the growth. 
</P>
<P>
However, she added, sales don't come even close to their potential, given the 
brand's strong name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a drop in the bucket (compared to) the numbers that could be sold. 
There's plenty of growth ahead."

LENDING: SOME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SAY PAYMENTS MADE TO BROKERS ARE REALLY

<P>
An obscure legal dispute could affect the way in which mortgages totaling 
billions of dollars are marketed to home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Once a quiet argument between lobbyists and bureaucrats at the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, the dispute has spread to Capitol Hill, where a 
House hearing is scheduled for April 19. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the background: Citicorp, Prudential Real Estate Affiliates of Costa 
Mesa and a few other companies use computers to match home buyers with suitable 
mortgages. In Prudential's case, the lender pays Prudential $425 per customer. 
Prudential then pays its broker $100 to defray the cost of operating the 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
The Mortgage Bankers Assn. contends that the $100 payments are, in fact, 
referral fees, which are barred by federal law. The reason: Consumers might not 
get the best deal from a lender who is paying brokers to refer customers to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential's computer system, for instance, offers a choice of, at most, eight 
lenders. Citicorp's system offers just one: Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
Interest on Citicorp loans, the mortgage bankers contend, averages one-quarter 
to one-half a percentage point higher than that on most loans. Citicorp 
counters that its rates are "competitive." 
</P>
<P>
"These programs are a very expensive convenience," said Sharon Canavan, a 
lobbyist for the mortgage bankers. "Borrowers should take the time to go out 
and shop." 
</P>
<P>
That's nonsense, says the National Assn. of Realtors: The Prudential system, 
for instance, actually offers consumers a wider choice by offering loans from 
as many as eight lenders in one place. And the $100 only reimburses the broker 
for costs incurred, says the realtors association. 
</P>
<P>
It's perfectly legal, and both Citicorp and Prudential have letters from HUD 
saying so. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't tell people to work for nothing," said William North, executive vice 
president of the realtors group, "and HUD agrees with that." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is the latest turf fight in the financial services industry after 
nearly a decade of sweeping changes that saw savings and loans gain some of the 
powers of banks and banks push into such new businesses as stock brokerages. 
This fight wouldn't even have been possible 10 years ago, when computerized 
mortgage systems were just emerging. 
</P>
<P>
But as the new systems proliferate, they threaten to move much of the marketing 
of mortgages out of the offices of the thrifts and mortgage companies and into 
real estate brokerages. Prudential, for instance, estimates that as many as a 
fifth of the mortgages in some cities could eventually be marketed through its 
2-year-old system -- or about $10 billion worth of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear (the mortgage bankers) are upset because the brokers are doing 
something they've never done before: marketing mortgages," said Stanley M. 
Gordon, a Newport Beach lawyer and lobbyist for Prudential. 
</P>
<P>
When the mortgage bankers' group couldn't persuade HUD to declare the payments 
illegal, it began lobbying Congress to change the law. This is now the group's 
top priority. 
</P>
<P>
HUD declined to issue clearer regulations and put an end to the argument, 
partly for fear of offending the heavy-duty players involved and partly because 
it's still digging out from last year's huge influence-peddling scandal, 
according to sources familiar with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
The politicians may be reluctant to make major changes too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough to get anybody to take sides on this," said one House 
staffer. "Everybody's going to want to punt because, if you're able to link the 
big real estate brokerages with the big banks, eventually you're going to knock 
out the middle man, the small thrifts and the mortgage bankers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why this issue is such a screamer." 
</P>
<P>
This could be the mortgage bankers' last chance: The group can't afford to keep 
spending large sums on lobbying. And some of the trade association's own 
members -- including Citicorp and some Prudential subsidiaries -- disagree with 
its stand. Furthermore, it's up against one of Washington's most powerful 
lobbies, the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Congress may be in a mood to listen. Housing will be a major 
issue on Capitol Hill this year, as the House and the Bush Administration 
prepare housing plans. And the mortgage bankers are trying to line up consumer 
groups on their side. 
</P>
<P>
The law behind the debate is called RESPA, the Real Estate Settlement and 
Procedures Act of 1974, which sought to protect consumers from unscrupulous 
brokers and lenders. The act bans referral fees but says a lender can give 
"reasonable value for services provided." 
</P>
<P>
It's that line, the realtor group says, that justifies reimbursing brokers for 
operating the computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
HUD agreed and gave letters approving the practice to Citicorp's MortgagePower 
in 1986 and Prudential's Computerized Loan Origination System, or CLOS, in 
1988. These are by far the two biggest networks, although the mortgage bankers 
complain that other, smaller systems are starting up around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Citicorp is the largest mortgage lender in the country. Most of the $12 billion 
in mortgages that it wrote last year came through the 4,000 MortgagePower 
computer systems installed in the offices of real estate and mortgage brokers 
in 37 states. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Prudential, Citicorp does not reimburse the broker, but charges brokers 
for using the system and leaves it up to them whether to pass the cost on to 
their customers. 
</P>
<P>
This might seem much ado about nothing -- except for the potentially huge 
amounts of money involved and the importance of CLOS, in particular, to 
Prudential's corporate strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Prudential began selling its franchises to brokers in 1988, long after most 
other real estate franchises started. Many brokerages -- and many of the best 
ones -- are already affiliated with other franchise companies, such as Century 
21 and Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
In order to grow, Prudential needed a "hook" to get brokers to sign up, and its 
hook was CLOS. Another selling point for these systems is that they speed loan 
approval for borrowers. In less than two years, Prudential has signed up 500 
brokerages nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is so important to Prudential and Citicorp that they have put their 
own lobbyists on the case. While the debate so far has attracted little 
attention outside the industry, it may heat up if politicians begin holding 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mortgage bankers are getting ready to roll the dice, having voted 
recently to spend $250,000 to lobby Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"This year is their big shot at it," said Gordon, the Prudential lobbyist. 
"They can't afford to keep spending that kind of money."

Bass Newspaper Bid Rejected: Directors of a nonprofit journalism institute 
unanimously rejected an offer for the sale of the controlling interest in the 
St. Petersburg Times to a Texas billionaire. The Poynter-Jamison Ventures 
Limited Partnership, headed by Texas investor Robert M. Bass, made the offer to 
pay $270 million for outstanding shares in Times Holding Co. in a letter Jan. 
30 to Times Publisher Andrew Barnes. Acquisition of the shares would give the 
Bass group control of Times Publishing Co., which owns the newspaper and four 
magazines, including Congressional Quarterly and Florida Trend.

Rig Count Jumps 19: The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs increased for 
the first time this year when it jumped by 19 rigs this week to a total 918, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker Hughes Inc. of Houston reported that the number of working rigs remained 
well above the figures from a year ago, when the nation's rig count was posted 
at 766. Last week, the rig count dropped by 32 to 899, following several weeks 
of decline. From the beginning of the year until this week, the country had 
lost 167 working rigs. Experts had blamed the drop on a general seasonal 
decline.

MARKETING THE MYSTIQUE OF GLACIER ICE; 
</P>
<P>
ALASKA: THE STATE'S PRIZE-WINNING BREWERY AND DISTILLERY BOTH BASE THEIR 
BEVERAGES ON WATER FROM GLACIERS. 
</P>

ANCHORAGE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alaska's only distillery and its only brewery are both prize winners -- and one 
of the reasons may be the water, which is melted glacier ice. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent "blind" tasting of vodkas conducted by the Memphis Commercial 
Appeal newspaper, Attakiska vodka, which is made here, placed first. In a 
feature story on vodka last summer in Town &amp; Country magazine, Attakiska 
was named "the one American vodka in a class with the imports." 
</P>
<P>
Alaskan brand beer, brewed in Juneau, the state's tiny capital, was selected 
the best beer in America in a poll of 4,500 people attending the annual Great 
American Beer Festival in Denver in 1988. The beer also won high honors in 1987 
and 1989 at the festival -- the nation's largest such event -- where 160 
domestic beers are judged. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad record for Alaska's only two producers of alcoholic beverages, 
especially considering that the brewery only began production in December, 
1986, and the vodka distillery in November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Mountain Top Spirits Co., which operates the first licensed distillery 
in the history of Alaska, produces Attakiska vodka. Its president is Mark 
Wilson, 41, who holds a zoology degree from Washington State University. Wilson 
also heads Wetco, a 7-year-old company that produces, among other things, 
glacier water and glacier ice. Both firms are based in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1987, Wilson displayed golf-ball-size pieces of glacier ice in 
Tokyo at an exhibition of Alaskan products. "It was kind of a wacky idea: 
glacier ice to cool drinks," Wilson recalled in a recent interview. "The 
Japanese loved it. It totally caught us off guard." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, Wilson found himself in the glacier ice business. His crews began 
harvesting floating ice in Alaskan bays, chopping it and packaging it in 
50-pound bags for export to Japan. He has sold half a million pounds of the ice 
each year for the past three years, charging about $1 a pound. Now Wetco has 
eight competitors selling the slow-melting hard ice, which makes a distinctive 
crackling noise as it chills a drink. 
</P>
<P>
The water used in Attakiska vodka, which retails here for $16.95 a bottle, 
comes from the melting ice of Eklutna Glacier just outside Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to eventually sell about 5% of the vodka in Alaska, with the rest 
of the sales in the U.S. and Japan," Wilson said. Last year, one-third of the 
sales were in Alaska. Most of the rest went east of the Mississippi, and a 
small amount was sold to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
California is scheduled to receive its first shipment of the vodka this month 
in San Francisco, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Juneau, more than 500 miles southeast of Anchorage, Marcy and Geoff Larson, 
both 32 and married five years, are general partners in Alaskan Brewing &amp; 
Bottling, makers of Alaskan brand beer. Marcy Larson runs the business end of 
the brewery; her husband is brew-master. She is a photojournalism graduate of 
Furman University in Greenville, S.C., and Geoff received a degree in chemistry 
from the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Before moving to Alaska to open the brewery, both worked briefly in a small 
brewery in Iowa and spent three years visiting breweries and reading everything 
they could find on beer. "We searched the state archives here in Juneau, 
learning the history of beer making in Alaska," Marcy Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of this research, the couple discovered a recipe used by Douglas 
City Brewing Co., a brewery that operated from 1899 to 1907 in a small town 
across Gastineau Channel from Juneau. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the . . . recipe, modified it and brew our beer with only natural 
ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and water -- the water from local glaciers," 
Geoff Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, they called the beer Chinook Alaskan, but now it is simply 
Alaskan, and a six-pack sells for $7 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
Production grew last year to 125,000 gallons, almost all of it sold in 700 
Alaskan stores, bars and restaurants. But the brewery does ship 200 cases a 
month to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the early success of Alaska's two beverage makers really derives from 
some unique qualities of glacier ice is anyone's guess, but the Larsons insist 
that it's a key ingredient. For consumers, however, the drinks' mystique may 
count for as much as their taste.

Stock prices fell Monday in thin trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange amid 
concerns of a possible increase in the official interest rate by the Bank of 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The blue chip Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which lost 11.67 points 
Friday, fell 237.72 points to 37,222.60. 
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Exchange index of all listed major shares dropped 
27.49 points to 2,718.56. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 330 million shares changed hands, compared to 520 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One broker said investors retreated to the sidelines in the afternoon session 
because of concerns about an expected hike in Japan's interest rate following 
the victory of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop also reflected bearish movement of the Japanese yen against the 
dollar on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stock prices fell sharply in a lackluster session on London's Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said they witnessed little outright selling and said the decline came 
as market makers cut prices to try to entice some buying. 
</P>
<P>
With Wall Street shut for the Presidents' Day holiday, they found few takers 
for stocks even at the cheaper levels, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a dire lack of interest," said a director at a large U.S. brokerage 
firm. "Fund managers are using the day as an excuse to do absolutely nothing." 
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 28.8 
points, or 1.2%, at 2,297.1. Volume amounted to a very light 308.3 million 
shares, compared to 438.8 million shares Friday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Declines in Light Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against other major currencies in light European trading Monday 
as the West German mark gained ground. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were little changed. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday in the United States reduced volume on European exchanges 
considerably, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar fell against the mark on technical factors. They also 
said continued speculation about an interest rate hike by the West German 
central bank was generating interest in the mark. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency, however, gained modestly against the yen on some 
short-covering. Short-covering is the buying of dollars to fulfill earlier 
agreements to sell them. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar gained because the election victory of the ruling Liberal Democratic 
Party did not generate more buying in the yen, which had advanced ahead of the 
election, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.7030 from $1.6953 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared to late Friday's rates, included: 
1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6794; 1.4885 Swiss francs, down from 
1.4930; 5.6955 French francs, down from 5.7045; 1.8870 Dutch guilders, down 
from 1.8915; 1,243.00 Italian lire, down from 1,246.00, and 1.1993 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.1997. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where the dollar begins its day, the U.S. currency slipped 0.03 yen 
to a closing 144.52 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 144.60 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $416.50 an ounce from $416.65 bid 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>

STUDY SAYS HEALTH BENEFITS ARE KEY ISSUE IN STRIKES; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: DISPUTES OVER MEDICAL COVERAGE MOTIVATED 78% OF STRIKERS IN 1989, THE 
REPORT FINDS.

<P>
The percentage of strikers who walked off the job over health benefits more 
than quadrupled during the late 1980s as soaring medical costs led to a 
breakdown in labor-management relations, a union report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the 925,000-member Service Employees Union found that disputes over 
health coverage motivated 78% of the strikers in 1989. In 1986, health benefits 
were a prime factor for only 18% of the strikers whose motivations could be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 alone, strikes over health coverage cost the economy $1.1 billion in 
lost wages, said the study, which was based on statistics from the Labor 
Department and the private Bureau of National Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The study concluded that "both sides are losing" in the battle over health 
benefits and called for united action on health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
"Rapidly rising health-care costs in the 1980s have fueled an escalating 
breakdown in labor-management relations," it said. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking ahead to the 1990s, continued double-digit health care cost inflation 
threatens our country with escalating labor unrest and the eventual destruction 
of employer-provided health insurance as the major vehicle for providing health 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the increase in benefits-related strikes in 1989 can be attributed to 
the walkout by more than 150,000 workers against the regional telephone 
companies, said John Howley, senior policy analyst with the service workers. 
</P>
<P>
The phone workers represented about a third of the 432,600 strikers during the 
first 10 months of 1989, the period for which statistics were available, he 
said. There were 506,200 strikers in all of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The study examined strikes involving more than 1,000 workers each. Using news 
reports and interviews with strikers, it determined causes for walkouts 
involving 79% of strikers in 1986 and 97% of strikers in 1989. Only strikes for 
which causes were determined were included in the report. 
</P>
<P>
The study said labor and management negotiated health benefits for 40 years 
without serious disputes. But recently, it said, employers "in desperation" 
have tried to shift rising health costs to workers, fueling unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The report said workers covered by plans with cost sharing paid 6.6% of their 
after-tax earnings for health premiums in 1988. It predicted that if current 
trends continue, the figure would rise to 27% by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Canner, National Assn. of Manufacturers assistant vice president of 
industrial relations, said employers agree that reforms are necessary to 
control health-care costs and stave off future strike activity. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't indefinitely expand employee share. Particularly at lower 
income, there are people who just can't bear the freight," she said. "We have 
had a lot of conversations with labor. I think we agree on what the problems 
are. We differ on the solutions."

MARKETING: FILM ASKS, 'WHAT IF ADS TOLD THE TRUTH?' MADISON AVE. DOESN'T LIKE

Suppose you turned on your TV and saw this commercial: "We know we're not sexy. 
But being sexy today is not such a great idea with so many new diseases around. 
Be safe instead of sexy. Buy Volvo. Boxy but good." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Volvo's not running that advertisement. But beginning April 11 this 
parody-commercial -- and several other outlandish, make-believe ads for Jaguar 
and John Hancock life insurance -- will be seen on movie screens nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaguar commercial promises men who own Jaguars that they will receive 
sexual favors "from women you hardly know." And the John Hancock ad notes: "We 
know you love him, but if he dies, we give you a summer home and two 
Mercedes-Benzes. Wouldn't that be nice, too?" 
</P>
<P>
To the burned-out ad executive played by Dudley Moore in the upcoming Paramount 
Pictures comedy "Crazy People," such commercials are examples of something few 
ad executives ever consider creating: honest ads. But before the film has even 
been released, West Coast advertising executives are generally reacting with 
outrage.

"The idea that advertising isn't truthful is a fabricated concept," said 
Clifford J. Einstein, president of Dailey &amp; Associates, which creates ads 
for the California State Lottery. "Advertising is more truthful than the news." 
</P>
<P>
"This movie might upset people in the advertising business," said Mitch 
Markowitz, who wrote the screenplay about an ad executive who is committed to a 
mental institution by his co-workers for creating truthful ads. "But what some 
advertisements do is unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
Markowitz, who has never worked at an agency, said he is not condemning all 
advertising. But he comes down hard on certain categories -- such as 
automobiles and liquor. His original script included a whiskey ad that said: 
"Having tax problems? Get drunk." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I hadn't let them talk me (into) taking that one out of the script," 
said Markowitz, who also wrote the hit film "Good Morning, Vietnam." "Why do 
most people drink whiskey? To get drunk." 
</P>
<P>
How will the rest of Madison Avenue react to this film? "I think ad people will 
love it," said producer Thomas Barad. "These characters do what we all want to 
do -- tell the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprising, these "truthful" ads in the film have wildly successful 
results. And that is not without precedent. One of the first American ad 
executives to practice truth in advertising on a grand scale was Bill Bernbach, 
who in the 1960s created the famous Volkswagen ad that flatly stated: "It's 
ugly, but it gets you there." 
</P>
<P>
"Crazy People" is hardly the first film to take a poke at the advertising 
business. Last year, the British film "How to Get Ahead in Advertising" struck 
a nerve when it depicted an ad man so obsessed with a pimple medication 
campaign that he developed a boil on his neck that ultimately took over his 
body. And in the 1986 film "Nothing in Common," Tom Hanks played a Chicago 
advertising whiz kid who realized he was no less a huckster than his dying 
father -- a salesman for a children's clothing manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Crazy People" won't be released for several months, its basic premise 
-- that most advertising is dotted with deceit -- is already hitting some top 
ad executives where it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"Most advertising creates its own reality, so in that sense ads do lie," said 
Nancy Shalek, president of Shalek Agency, which creates ads for Speedo 
swimsuits and Teleflora. "That bothers me. But it also gives our agency a great 
competitive advantage. Most advertising goes off the deep end when it tries to 
sell. We never tell people to buy our clients' products. We give them 
permission to do what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Some advertising can be unintentionally deceiving. Ken Mandelbaum once worked 
for Hal Riney &amp; Partners, which created the original Bartles &amp; Jaymes 
spots that feature the two fictional pitchmen for the Gallo wine cooler. When 
Mandelbaum went to open an account at a major California bank, the branch 
manager was convinced that Bartles &amp; Jaymes were not actors but the 
winery's founders. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told her they were actors, she thought I was putting her on," said 
Mandelbaum, now president of Mandelbaum Mooney Ashley. "But I've never worked 
at an agency where you sit and figure how to dupe the consumer." 
</P>
<P>
Two ad executives objected strongly to the premise of "Crazy People." 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize it, but advertising is the most policed, safeguarded 
industry around," said Einstein of Dailey &amp; Associates. "Every claim has to 
be substantiated with reams of documents." 
</P>
<P>
And Vic Olesen, president of Vic Olesen &amp; Partners, which creates ads for 
Chevrolet, wonders if the film "Crazy People" will be advertised truthfully. He 
suggested this ad: "This is an average movie with an aging star who spends most 
of his time sulking in his own restaurant. And it was written by a guy with no 
agency experience who is also a pessimist." 
</P>

Disney Theater Ad Ban a Boon for Slides 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney has given Bob Martin a new lease on life. His company, National 
Cinema Network, places slide-show advertisements in theaters. When Disney 
recently announced that it would no longer tolerate commercials broadcast in 
theaters showing its films, it did not rule out slide shows. 
</P>
<P>
Now Martin, president of the Kansas City company, says he plans to "upgrade" 
his slide shows and sell them to more chains. Although each tray of 81 slides 
will still have about 25 ads, the remaining slides will be more entertaining, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sit here with a great deal of confidence and tell you that people won't 
boo at our programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the extra slides often feature film trivia. But the new shows -- 
which will begin screening in Los Angeles by April -- will also feature an 
array of "Memorable Moments" from recent films and "Classic Clips" from older 
films. Said Martin: "If you're on a date and you don't know what else to talk 
about, these slides will stimulate conversation."

Suzuki Runner-Up Appeals to Dealers 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles agency that finished second to Asher/Gould in the race for the 
Suzuki advertising business late last year continues to snatch various Suzuki 
dealer association accounts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Hakuhodo Advertising won a combined $1 million in annual billings from Suzuki 
dealer groups in Seattle and San Francisco. It already handles about $1 million 
in annual billings from Suzuki dealer outfits in San Diego, Phoenix and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hakuhodo spokeswoman Jo DeLyon, "We're demonstrating our capabilities to 
do automotive advertising."

No Smoking on Flights Sparks CigArrest Ads 
</P>
<P>
Peter Stranger happily marked Feb. 26 on his calendar. That's not his birthday, 
his anniversary or, for that matter, a day off from work. 
</P>
<P>
It is the day on which a regulation banning smoking takes effect on all 
domestic flights lasting six hours or less. And the new client that his Los 
Angeles ad agency recently picked up is counting on that day as a major 
marketing tool. 
</P>
<P>
The client: Advantage Life Products, a Laguna Hills maker of CigArrest 
stop-smoking products and chewing gum, which the company claims helps stop the 
tobacco craving. The company's annual billings are estimated at $4 million. And 
Stranger, who is president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee 
WCRS, believes that as more people are told that they can't smoke in places 
such as airplanes and office buildings, they will turn to products such as 
CigArrest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not just for those who want to quit," said Stranger. "It is also for 
smokers who are stuck in places where they are not allowed to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
He said his agency will create some humorous ads depicting these situations. 
Stranger himself quit smoking about 10 years ago. But not because he wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
"I met a woman who didn't like my smoking," he said. "My wife." 
</P>

Bank Offers Depositors a Waldorf Weekend 
</P>
<P>
Some banks will do almost anything to get your money. A New York bank is even 
waving a weekend at the Waldorf Astoria at its big-ticket customers. Commercial 
Bank of New York, an 18-month-old bank with assets of $278 million, offers two 
(taxable) weekend nights and breakfasts at the Waldorf (estimated value: $425) 
to customers who purchase 30-month, $100,000 certificates of deposit. Interest 
rates on these CDs have recently varied between 8.5% and 8.875%. 
</P>
<P>
A recent newspaper ad showed a photo of a Waldorf room key under this headline: 
"We're offering this particular CD with some reservations."

NASSCO SAYS IT'S POISED FOR DOUBLE-HULL WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Executives of National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., which this month won the 
first major commercial shipbuilding contract awarded to a U.S. shipyard since 
1984, believe the firm is well positioned to win additional contracts, if 
legislation mandates the use of double hulls or double bottoms on oil tankers 
operating in U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
"Nassco traditionally has been the predominant commercial shipbuilder in the 
U.S.," said Fred Hallett, company vice president. While it is unable to compete 
with "heavily subsidized" shipyards in foreign countries, Hallett said, Nassco, 
which has trimmed its operating costs, is extremely competitive with the 
handful of remaining domestic shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
Nassco's new stance came into play earlier this month when San Francisco-based 
Matson Navigation awarded the firm a $129-million contract to build a 713-foot 
container ship, the first commercial ship to be built at the Nassco yard on San 
Diego Bay since the Exxon Valdez was completed in 1986. The Valdez ran aground 
last spring in Alaskan waters, causing the nation's worst oil spill, and is now 
being repaired at a Nassco dock. 
</P>
<P>
Bids to build the container ship, which will operate between West Coast ports 
and Hawaii, were limited to U.S. shipbuilders because of the Jones Act, a World 
War II-era law that prohibits foreign-built ships from hauling cargo between 
U.S. ports. The law does not apply to ships that, for example, haul fuel oil 
from Indonesia to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
If the Jones Act remains in force, Nassco stands a good chance of outbidding 
its domestic competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is now considering two bills that could eventually require new tankers 
to have double hulls or double bottoms. A House bill would require double hulls 
or bottoms for new tankers and retrofitting of existing tankers. A Senate bill 
would direct the Department of Transportation to study whether double hulls 
would reduce the likelihood of spills, but would not require retrofitting of 
existing tankers. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approach frustrates Hallett because "we've had repeated studies 
during the past 10 years, and every time (a spill occurs) we get another 
study." But some shipping industry observers believe legislators will probably 
mandate the use of double-hulled or -bottomed ships. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the American Trader spilled almost 400,000 gallons of crude oil 
into the ocean off Huntington Beach on Feb. 8, Arthur McKenzie, president of 
the Tanker Advisory Center in New York, said the disaster had put "irresistible 
pressure" on legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," McKenzie said after the spill, which occurred less than a year 
after the Valdez spill. He called the new spill the "icing on the cake. . . . 
Now we're going to get double bottoms." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. shipbuilders would have little trouble designing and building 
double-hulled or double-bottomed tankers, Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology . . . is well within our capabilities. There are already six 
double-hulled ships, so clearly they are technologically feasible." Similarly, 
U.S. shipbuilders could use the technology to retrofit existing tankers, 
Hallett said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that U.S. shipyards have a vested interest in requiring the 
nation's oil companies to use newly built, double-hulled or double-bottomed 
ships on runs between U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
"Shipbuilders are facing a very difficult future because U.S. Navy shipbuilding 
programs are going away," Hallett said. U.S. shipbuilders believe that building 
ships with double hulls or double bottoms "would be both environmentally (safe) 
and give shipyards the methodology of changing from military to civilian yards. 
You have to appreciate the fact that without some kind of new construction, 
there's no future for shipbuilding in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
While shipbuilders support construction of a new generation of tankers, oil 
companies oppose the double-hull legislation. Members of an industry group 
representing oil companies and ship owners argue that it would be "ill-advised" 
to require double hulls or double bottoms because "studies on the effectiveness 
of these and other measures are still in progress." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hallett maintained that it is clearly time to replace the nation's 
aging "Jones Act fleet . . . (because), according to the typical life span of a 
tanker, you'd start to see ships being replaced at about 20 years." He argued 
that existing ships should not be "grandfathered," because "you'd see people 
take 30-year-old ships and try to extend their life spans in any way possible."

PS Group: The San Diego-based firm reported a $4.8-million net loss for the 
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, contrasted with a $1.7-million net loss during 
the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 27% to $64.6 million, up from 
$50.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group reported a $2.9-million net profit for the year ended Dec. 31, 
contrasted with $44.1 million in net income for the previous year. The 1988 net 
income figure included a gain from the termination of PS Group's pension plan. 
Revenue fell to $264 million for the year ended Dec. 31, down from $331 million 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group's revenue was hurt during the fourth quarter by lower airline ticket 
prices that produced lower average commissions. PS Group also reported a pretax 
charge to earnings of $5 million "for the writedown of the carrying value of 
certain high-yield securities held in the company's investment portfolio," 
according to a spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The writedown was linked to a January bankruptcy filing by Allied and Federated 
department stores, which issued securities held by PS Group. The writedown was 
required because of the "substantial decline" in the high-yield, or junk bond, 
securities.

Furnishings 2000: The San Diego-based home furnishings retailer reported a net 
loss of $3.6 million for the second quarter ended Dec. 31. Furnishings 2000 
reported an $800,000 net loss during the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue fell to $22.3 million for the quarter, down from $36.7 million a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Furnishings 2000 reported a $10.9-million net loss for the six-month period 
ended Dec. 31, contrasted with a $1.8-million net loss a year earlier. Revenue 
fell to $37.3 million, down from $68.3 million during the same quarter a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company linked the loss to "low sales volume and the adverse effect of a 
legal settlement in the quarter." The company recorded a $1-million charge 
during the quarter for the tentative settlement of a sex-discrimination charge. 
</P>
<P>
GF Holdings Inc. acquired 63.1% of Furnishing 2000's outstanding common stock

BIDDERS OFTEN LAND A DEAL AT AUCTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A SMALL BUT GROWING CIRCLE OF BUYERS HAVE ACQUIRED CITY PROPERTY 
THROUGH OCCASIONAL PUBLIC AUCTIONS, BUT THE POOL OF SURPLUS SITES IS 
DIMINISHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Susan Lew didn't relish the prospect of a bidding war when she set 
out to acquire a piece of property owned jointly by the city of San Diego and 
the state. But the San Diego developer wanted the vacant lot too much to pass 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
Lew knew that buying land at public auction could be risky, but the 
55,000-square-foot site at the northeast corner of Convoy Street and Aero Drive 
in the heart of Kearny Mesa's burgeoning Asian community seemed perfectly 
suited for the Asian-American retail center she wanted to build. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many of the 15 prospective buyers who bid on the property, Lew was armed 
with reams of information -- including a realistic idea of the property's 
leasing income. 
</P>
<P>
Lew, who had determined that she could pay up to $25 a square foot for the 
property and still turn a profit when it was developed, grabbed the site for 
$1.2 million, or $72,500 less than her top price. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised we won," Lew said. "People in the city were very helpful to 
explain the procedure. I knew immediately I wanted (the property). And when I 
found what I wanted, I determined to get it." 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1988, land auction introduced Lew, 42, to the small but growing 
circle of buyers who have acquired city property through the occasional public 
auctions held since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The city's next public auction could be held as early as midsummer. A city 
manager's report submitted last Wednesday to the City Council's Public 
Facilities and Recreation Committee identified 48 pieces of property totaling 
153 acres -- and worth at least $6 million -- that qualify to be auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
The massive report does not include an estimated 125 additional sites that, 
because of their odd shapes or inconvenient locations, can be bought only by 
adjacent property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city properties sold at auction have been residential sites because 
a city policy requires the leasing of commercial land. But occasionally, as in 
Lew's case, the city does auction off a commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
The city began to sell off its surplus lands in 1978 under a policy that 
directed it to begin auctioning off large portions of its remaining "pueblo 
lands," that is, the unused properties the city had owned since its 
incorporation in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
However, land sold during recent auctions was mainly acquired between 1930 and 
1950, from citizens who failed to pay their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The city acquired much of its surplus property, at 50% of its assessed value, 
from the county tax collector. In most instances, the city intended to use the 
land to house schools, fire stations or other city projects, but, for one 
reason or another, the projects never worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, few San Diego real estate agents or developers know about the 
auctions. But deals such as the one Lew found will become scarcer because the 
city's inventory of surplus property is running out. 
</P>
<P>
"We have diminishing assets here, and it has been rapidly decreasing since the 
late 1970s," said Michael Steffens, marketing supervisor for the San Diego 
Property Department. "I just may be out of a job one day soon." 
</P>
<P>
Typically, any land sales must first be approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The properties identified in the most recent report as auctionable range in 
size from .04 to 80 acres, and are valued at between $10,000 and $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the sites listed -- including an 80-acre parcel of grazing land valued 
at $160,000 that the city originally purchased for use as a reservoir -- might 
one day be converted into public parks. 
</P>
<P>
Steffens said the hottest surplus property likely to be auctioned is an 
8,930-square-foot lot in La Jolla Shores zoned for a single-family home. 
Although the property department set the lot's value at $259,000, brokers say 
it is worth substantially more. 
</P>
<P>
"The least expensive lot in La Jolla is $375,000," said Peggy Chodorow, 
associate vice president of Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate. "This 
would have to be a real dog of a lot to be worth $259,000. I just hope they 
(city officials) are aware that condo prices rose 29% last year and home prices 
rose 36%." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all the properties will be reassessed before the auction in order to 
get the city the best price possible, Steffens said. "The policy we have is if 
a property is developable as a separate parcel, we want to get the highest 
return we can. The best way to do that is through the auction process." 
</P>
<P>
Other properties likely to be approved for sale include: 
</P>
<P>
* An 8.4-acre residential lot on the east side of Mast Boulevard north of 
Ronson Drive in Santee. The property, which is zoned to hold at least 40 
apartment units, is estimated to be worth about $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
* A 30-acre lot west of Interstate 5 and north of Ardath Road in La Jolla 
Shores, valued at $2.4 million. The property is zoned to hold up to 8 dwellings 
per acre in a cluster configuration, but the tract might be difficult to 
develop because of its topography. 
</P>
<P>
* A 4,792-square-foot parcel in Uptown, zoned for commercial use. The property 
has height limitations, however, because it sits in the approach path to 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
Lew, the developer who bought the Kearny Mesa site at the city's last auction, 
said she plans to comb through the current list to look for other parcels she 
may want to buy. "If they have some good property available, I would do it 
again," she said.

VALLEY EARNINGS: TANDON CORP. REPORTS PROFIT FOR 4TH QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tandon Corp. said it earned $5.32 million in the fourth quarter of 1989, 
rebounding from a year-earlier loss of $21.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Moorpark maker of personal computers, most of which are sold in Europe, 
said the improved results came on a 15% gain in sales, to $103.7 million from 
$90.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Tandon said the latest earnings partly reflected increased sales of its more 
expensive personal computers, which carried higher profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1989, however, Tandon lost $4.33 million compared with a loss of 
$19.9 million the previous year. Its annual sales rose 22% to $377.9 million 
from $309.4 million.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: CIBA-GEIGY SAYS IT WILL KEEP SHARE IN 3-D SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ciba-Geigy reversed earlier plans and said it will retain its 37% ownership of 
3-D Systems, the Canadian parent company of 3D Systems Inc. in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss conglomerate, announced in December that it planned to sell 
its 3-D holdings and Spectra-Physics, a San Jose company that is the biggest 
U.S. laser producer. 3-D Systems makes a machine that uses lasers, chemicals 
and a computer to rapidly make models of parts, consumer packages and other 
products for manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Ciba-Geigy said it still plans to sell Spectra-Physics, but "does not presently 
intend" to sell its 3-D stock. Ciba-Geigy did not elaborate on its change of 
mind, and spokesman Tom Chizmadia at Ciba-Geigy's U.S. headquarters in Ardsley, 
N.Y., declined further comment.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: U.S. COMMODITIES AGENCY SUES PRECIOUS-METAL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it filed a two-count complaint in 
U.S. District Court in Los Angeles against Eurogold Exchange, a Westlake 
Village company. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint alleges that starting in June, 1987, Eurogold Exchange sold 
precious-metal option contracts without being properly registered with the 
CFTC, the federal agency that oversees commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
The company also did not register as required under the California Corporations 
Code, the CFTC complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint also names Kevin Mitchell, who lives in Westlake Village; Hans J. 
Schulz, a resident of West Germany, and Gerald Rogers, also known as J.K. 
Glenn, who is in the custody of Swiss officials pending his return to the 
United States in connection with other criminal proceedings, the CFTC said. 
</P>
<P>
The CFTC said a federal court judge last month granted its request for a 
temporary restraining order freezing Eurogold's assets in the United States, 
appointed a receiver for the company's assets and granted the commission access 
to the firm's books and records. 
</P>
<P>
David Ray, a Los Angeles attorney and the court-appointed receiver for 
Eurogold, said he had not yet seen the records for the company and did not know 
the extent of the company's assets.

JACK SMITH: THE TRUE GENESIS OF HIS AWARD REMAINS UNCERTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having written columns in defense of bats, coyotes and frogs, I found myself 
the other day among 27 recipients of the Genesis Award at a luncheon given by 
the Fund for Animals in the Beverly Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
Although the menu was vegetarian, in keeping with the spirit of the awards, the 
audience was enthusiastic -- almost boisterous -- greeting the winners with 
heavy applause, whistles and hoots of approval. There were many celebrities 
present. 
</P>
<P>
The award itself was a plaque bearing a bronze replica of the fund's logo -- 
Noah's ark, whose story in Genesis was cited in the program as the first "news 
report" of an animal rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
By pure luck I sat next to Karen Caesar, an intense, articulate young woman who 
exemplifies the principles of the animal protectionists. Ms. Caesar not only 
does not eat meat in any form, she told me, but also avoids eggs and dairy 
products, and does not wear fur or leather. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't even have leather shoes?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
She said no; it is quite possible to buy shoes made of vinyl and other 
non-animal products. 
</P>
<P>
Chastened by this litany of self-denial, I was happy with my luncheon of 
vegetable crepes on a bed of fresh spinach, with baby carrots, asparagus and 
carmelized onion. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the winners were from radio, television and the movies, and with a few 
exceptions, they were present. Video clips of various winning shows were shown 
on a screen. 
</P>
<P>
Especially entertaining were clips from "General Hospital," about the ivory 
trade, "L.A. Law," about the trapping of fur animals, "Born Free," about the 
liberation of a lion, and "Gorillas in the Mist," about the life and death of 
Dian Fossey among the gorillas. 
</P>
<P>
I was first on the list to receive my award. Foreseeing that it was going to be 
a long afternoon, I tried to set a good example by being brief. I said I didn't 
know why I was being honored, but I thought it might be for something I had 
written about frogs. 
</P>
<P>
What I had written about frogs, actually, was a column applauding Jenifer 
Graham, who, as a high school girl, had defied the authorities by refusing to 
dissect a frog in biology class. I recalled that I had had to dissect a frog in 
my biology class, and that I had not enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
Some time later I was upstaged by the appearance of Ms. Graham herself. CBS had 
received an award for a dramatization of her story. A video showed a scene in 
which an actress playing Graham explained her feelings before a board. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward I fought my way through the crowds to Graham and asked her if she had 
read my column. She didn't remember it. Oh, well, maybe I got the award for the 
ones about bats and coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, my consciousness was raised. I was horrified by video clips on the 
poaching of elephants for ivory, the cruel trapping of animals for fur, and the 
imprisonment of calves for veal. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Ms. Caesar if it was all right to eat eggs. She said it was all right 
if the hens were range-fed, "so they have room to run around in." 
</P>
<P>
I didn't ask about bacon. I felt sure I knew what the answer would be. 
</P>
<P>
I am an animal lover, and I don't like to see them exploited or mistreated. But 
I'm afraid my commitment is not quite pure. I have virtually given up red meat 
(except for an occasional hamburger), but I eat chicken and fish. I do not wear 
fur or buy fur. I shun ivory. I do take insulin, which I suppose was developed 
through laboratory experiments on animals. But I don't use cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
A pretty spotty record, actually, for a Genesis Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
But I discovered that Ms. Caesar has a chink in her armor, too. "Twice a year," 
she said, "I eat a turkey sandwich. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
However, she went on to say, she does not eat turkey at Thanksgiving. "I feel 
that at Thanksgiving I have to make a stand." 
</P>
<P>
I have decided not to eat turkey at Thanksgiving, and I am going to give up 
turkey sandwiches altogether. But I don't think I can give up leather shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, be nice to a coyote and make room in your heart for a bat.

SPARSE AUDIENCE GREETS DUTCH ENSEMBLE QUINK

<P>
Never heard of Quink, the vocal ensemble that sang Friday night in Orange Coast 
College's Robert B. Moore Theatre? If the meager numbers that attended the 
concert are any indication, you are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Quink is worth hearing. The five-member a cappella group from the 
Netherlands -- in existence since 1978, but not heard in this country until 
1985 -- offers a strikingly translucent blend that its members apply to styles 
ranging from Renaissance madrigals to contemporary arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Homogeneous transparency can illuminate much in itself. In this program, the 
interplay of Hindemith's contrapuntal lines in "Vom Hausregiment," from his 
"Funf Lieder nach alten Texten," emerged with shimmering clarity. Equally 
successful were 16th-Century composer John Farmer's simple madrigal "Fair 
Phyllis" and the imploring sections of Benjamin Britten's 'Hymn to St. 
Cecelia," the former bathed in a pure innocence, the latter clothed in 
reverence. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the evening, however, transparency and attractive tone too 
often settled into a pleasant blandness. Though bolstered by flawless 
intonation and tasteful application of vibrato, Hindemith's "Frauenklage" -- a 
lady's lament over the imminent, inevitable parting from her love -- cried out 
for a shift to darker tone, while emphasis on polished simplicity glossed over 
the playfulness of Thomas Morley's "Now Is the Month of Maying."

Quink's anomalous name was invented by its members -- sopranos Machteld van 
Woerden and Marjolein Koetsier, contralto Corrie Pronk, tenor Harry van Berne, 
and bass Kees-Jan de Koning -- as a composite of various Dutch words including 
kwinkslag (humor) and kwetteren (to chirp). If Friday's accent was on the 
latter, it was not without its lighter side. A trio of animal-inspired 
selections by contemporary Catalan composer Manuel Oltra -- "Bestiari" -- 
twinkled with good-natured humor aided by clipped, synchronized accent in 
"Rata-Pinyada" (The Bat) and strident-edged trumpeting in "Elefant." Quink 
closed with the same type of silliness that often peppers appearances of the 
better-known Kings Singers: Paul Patterson's "Spare Parts," a bluesy take-off 
on the Frankenstein story, and "Sag mir nicht 'adieu,' " an imitation of a 
1930s recording complete with static and skips.

'Island Son' Reported Axed: Richard Chamberlain's latest show, "Island Son," is 
about to join "Dr. Kildare" in the television archives. Officials of Lorimar 
Productions, which produces the Hawaii-based show, told Teamsters who drive 
equipment trucks for the show that this week would be their final one, the 
Honolulu Advertiser reported. The newspaper also said that another union was 
advised that today would be the final day of filming and that Chamberlain, who 
plays Dr. Daniel Kulani on the show, was told of the decision by phone on 
Friday. Shauna Snow

NEW WORKS, OLD DIFFICULTIES FOR BALLET PACIFICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The young man sitting behind me Saturday night at the Ballet Pacifica 
performance at Laguna Playhouse was surprised that he could hear the clomp of 
toe shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the dancers just can't control their legs that well," he said in a 
puzzled tone. Indeed. It may be a new season for Ballet Pacifica, but their old 
problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
The women dance as though they think ballet is about being rigidly dainty: 
holding the arms just so, curving the wrists and fingers in a parody of 
elegance, keeping the torso ramrod straight and smiling a lot. The legs just 
come along for the ride. The men appear to have little notion of body 
alignment, precise positions or the need to harmonize their movements with the 
other dancers. No one moves with the freedom and fluidity that permits a 
personal interpretation of musical phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the two premieres by longtime 
company choreographer Kathy Kahn and former Joffrey Ballet dancer Carl Corry is 
that they were relatively brief. Kahn's "Rustic Concerto" is a seven-part piece 
for 12 dancers in peasant garb that attempts to keep up with several works by 
Vivaldi. Larded with pirouettes, effortful lifts and variations that consist of 
reversing movements rather than reworking them creatively, the piece is just 
hack work. A cutesy pose for four women at the conclusion of the second section 
was variety-show material. 
</P>
<P>
Corry's "The Beauty of One Divides" was accompanied by live musicians -- 
guitarists Gregory Coleman and John Schneiderman, and harpsichordist Martha 
Lewis -- playing sacred music by Bach, Mozart, John Hughes, R.H. Prichard and 
G. Young. Alas, the dancers looked so rushed and jerky that they might just as 
well have been moving to a tape's inflexible tempos. 
</P>
<P>
Garnished with gimmicky mood lighting devised by the choreographer, the piece 
is full of insufficiently developed phrases. In the "Deep River" section, 
Janine Paulsen and Lee Wigand ever-so-briefly dance cheek-to-cheek in a pool of 
light. Before we've fallen under their retro-style romantic spell, he hauls her 
up into what becomes an overhead carry, and the spell is broken. (It's also 
unclear what this passage has to do with the religious theme of the piece.) 
</P>
<P>
In any case, even so simple a movement as flinging up the arms in exultation 
(in the "God of Grace and God of Glory" section) eludes the company, whose lack 
of whole-body follow-through makes the gesture look like vapid cheerleading 
rather than an expression of fervor. 
</P>
<P>
The program concluded with artistic director Molly Lynch's "Characters" from 
1986, a breezy, aerobic piece for a pack of dancers who run and jete and 
sometimes pause for bits of would-be whimsical stage business.

Record Store Owner Back in Court: Tommy Hammond, who was convicted in Alabama 
in 1988 of violating an obscenity ordinance by selling a recording by the rap 
group 2 Live Crew, has taken his case back to court. 
</P>
<P>
Under Alabama law, any conviction before a Municipal Court judge must receive a 
jury trial at the circuit court level before it can be appealed. Hammond, who 
was fined $500 after his municipal court conviction in Alexander City, was 
charged after a woman complained about her son buying a copy of the "Move 
Somethin' " cassette at Hammond's store. His case is believed to mark the first 
time music has been found to be legally obscene in the United States. Shauna

Anderson Returns: Legendary actress Dame Judith Anderson, 93, returned to the 
stage Sunday night, giving an emotional and rare performance to benefit the 
140-seat Ensemble Theatre in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say I'm always nervous before a performance, but especially tonight," 
said Anderson, who has made only rare stage appearances since retiring more 
than 20 years ago. "Here I thought I'd read a little 'Macbeth' and 'Hamlet' and 
it wouldn't be so bad. But oh, dear, it is." The Tony and Emmy award-winning 
actress performed for more than an hour. Shauna Snow

The Indian government dissolved the legislature of Jammu and Kashmir state in 
an effort to restore peace to a region torn by a monthlong Muslim uprising 
against Indian rule. The move was a tacit admission by the central government 
that the 1987 elections for the Kashmir assembly were rigged, as is widely 
believed in the state.

INS HEEDS FAMILY PLEA, LETS NANNY HERO RETURN; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: PARENTS WIN BATTLE FOR ILLEGAL ALIEN WHO HELPED WHEN CHILD SHE 
CARED FOR WAS KIDNAPED. THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED THE WOMAN A SPECIAL 
DISPENSATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Five years ago, Hirlanda Ramirez trembled as she slipped across the U.S. border 
crossing at El Paso, undetected by busy immigration officers. On Sunday, she 
returned to Los Angeles -- legally -- and was welcomed by the U.S. government 
as a heroine. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, 33, who is from Guatemala and works as a nanny to a Pacific Palisades 
4-year-old, played a key role in helping the family and authorities when the 
girl was kidnaped briefly in 1987. Ramirez served as the main witness in the 
case even though she risked deportation. 
</P>
<P>
Her grace under pressure, as well as her strong bond with the precocious 
strawberry-blonde child, so impressed authorities that the federal government 
granted Ramirez a rare dispensation, allowing her to return to the United 
States and become a legal resident. 
</P>
<P>
The same moxie that initially brought Ramirez to the United States catapulted 
her into a role during the family's ordeal. She provided the family with moral 
support and cooperated with police and prosecutors in the case. 
</P>
<P>
But when she left for Guatemala three months ago, Ramirez and the family were 
uncertain whether they would ever see each other again. 
</P>
<P>
The family, which asked not to be identified, felt so strongly that Ramirez 
"deserved a break" after her "exceptional" conduct, that they began lobbying 
the federal government on her behalf, persevering for the better part of a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ramirez arrived at the family's sprawling, ranch-style home with a 
special "humanitarian parole" permit in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
As Ramirez approached the home, the little girl darted across the driveway and 
flew into her arms. "I missed you," she told Ramirez. "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
For the Guatemalan nanny it was a bittersweet homecoming. Her own children -- 
two boys ages 8 and 5, were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Ramirez, both in the United States and Guatemala, describe her 
as a woman of rare character and strength. Her courage has seldom failed her. 
</P>
<P>
Abandoned by her husband in Guatemala when she was pregnant with their second 
child, Ramirez was unable to support herself and her children with her factory 
job. 
</P>
<P>
She debated coming to the United States and leaving her children. "I cried and 
cried . . .," she recalled. "Then one day I said, 'Either I do something or I 
die of hunger with my children.' " 
</P>
<P>
She said she spent her first year in Los Angeles crying over her children's 
absence, but has never regretted her decision. The money she sends home from 
her earnings here enables her children to eat well. She regularly sends them 
new clothing and pays to send her eldest son to a private school. "Now they 
have a future," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez and the family she works for say they consider themselves fortunate for 
having met. The family lauds Ramirez as an exceptional woman of great warmth 
and strength. Ramirez said they make her feel like part of the family. 
</P>
<P>
"The love I can't give my own children, I give to her," said Ramirez, rocking 
her young ward on her lap. And the feeling is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
During Ramirez's three-month absence, the little girl often asked about her and 
kept a snapshot of the two of them taped to her bedroom wall, amid her dolls 
and stuffed animals. 
</P>
<P>
She does not remember the kidnaping that occurred a block from her home three 
years ago, and her parents want to keep it that way. She was only 14 months old 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was pushing the infant in a stroller in the middle of the afternoon 
when a masked man suddenly pulled up in a car. Flashing a gun, he grabbed the 
child and sped off, leaving a ransom note behind. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the "worst night of our lives," the anguished parents were 
informed the next morning that their child had been found wandering unharmed in 
a park. She had not been hurt or molested, said the girl's father, a 
radiologist. 
</P>
<P>
Her abductor had apparently kept her tied overnight to a tree in the Santa 
Monica Mountains, but had released her while he headed to pick up the ransom 
money. Police were waiting for him at the pickup spot. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment the kidnaping occurred, Ramirez never hesitated. She ran to a 
neighbor's home to call police and then cooperated fully during several hours 
of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
"A lesser person would have run away," said the girl's father. "She proved 
herself under fire." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was just as cooperative with the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office and, as the only realiable eyewitness in the case, her testimony was 
critical during the trial. The result was a life sentence for Mark Faulkner, 
then a 21-year-old San Fernando resident. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care if I got deported. What mattered to me was that the girl be 
recovered as quickly as possible," Ramirez said. "And if I hadn't testified, he 
might have done it again and again." 
</P>
<P>
The girl's father said that "it was a pretty open and shut case." Winding his 
way through the federal bureaucracy in search of clemency for Ramirez was a 
greater challenge. 
</P>
<P>
With guidance from an immigration lawyer, the girl's father was able to gain 
needed labor certification, through the U.S. Department of Labor, after 
demonstrating that the family was unable to find a U.S. citizen or legal 
resident willing and qualified to take her job. The family then petitioned for 
an immigrant visa on Ramirez's behalf. Although it was approved, it normally 
takes about three years for it to be granted. 
</P>
<P>
When Ramirez got word that one of her own children had fallen ill last fall, 
she flew back to Guatemala. Once outside the country, she had no legal basis 
for returning. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that the girl's father began a letter-writing and telephone 
campaign with immigration officials in Washington, asking that Ramirez be 
granted special "parole" status, allowing her to return to the country 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Ramirez important to his child's well-being, the father argued, 
"she deserved a break." 
</P>
<P>
"She did something that a lot of American citizens would not have done," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He felt so confident that justice was on his side that he wanted to test the 
system, he said. "I felt that if I'd ever been right in anything, I was right 
in this case. And I believed the system could respond." 
</P>
<P>
He had heard less than glowing reports about the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, often labeled one of the least efficient federal 
government agencies. To his surprise, however, he said he found that the INS 
had a heart. "They're tough, but there is compassion there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His perseverance and the compelling nature of the case won out. 
</P>
<P>
National INS Commissioner Gene McNary, who approved the parole petition based 
on humanitarian grounds, called it "a close call." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to appear to condone the practice of hiring illegal aliens as 
maids or nannies," he said, and added that the child's well-being was what 
persuaded the INS to grant the parole. The INS receives about 4,000 such 
petitions a year and approves only about one-fifth of them, according to an INS 
spokesman.

<P>
Led by an unprecedented return of convicted drug dealers, the number of felons 
paroled to Los Angeles County has increased more than 100% in the last five 
years, according to statistics released last week by the state Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
According to civil libertarians and some parole officials, the rising tide of 
parolees in the county, as well as elsewhere in California, may prove ominous 
news for law-and-order advocates like Gov. George Deukmejian, who found strong 
public support in pushing mandatory prison sentences and appointing hard-line 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
As convicts sent off in record numbers to overcrowded state prisons over the 
last decade return home, observers say, experience is showing that more than 
half of the parolees will be incarcerated again for using drugs or committing 
other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"The result of the Deukmejian get-tough-on-crime approach is now coming home to 
roost. It's now coming back to haunt us," said John Hagar, staff attorney for 
the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Prosecutors told the public that if we put people away for longer sentences in 
our clean, modern, safe prisons that you -- the public -- will be safe," said 
Hagar, who has represented inmates in lawsuits against the state. "That wasn't 
true. To put people away for longer periods of time in overcrowded institutions 
. . . made those people worse." 
</P>
<P>
Since stiff mandatory sentencing laws were passed in the late 1970s, the 
California prison population has ballooned to more than 87,000, forcing the 
state to build seven additional prisons and expand seven facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, inmates are now being released in record numbers. Statewide, the 
number of parolees has jumped 100% since 1984, statistics show. State prisons 
paroled 37,879 murderers, sex offenders, drug dealers and other felons in 1989, 
compared to 18,861 five years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County -- undisputably the largest exporter of criminals to state 
prisons -- also experienced a similar increase of returning inmates. There were 
14,493 parolees sent to the county last year, compared to 7,043 in 1984, a 106% 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
The major reason for the increase was an unprecedented number of convicted drug 
dealers heading home to Los Angeles. There were 566% more of that group paroled 
to the county in 1989 than five years ago, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
The returning parolees have only rarely triggered public outcries. Such was the 
case last month for attempted murderer Charles David Rothenberg, who set his 
son on fire in an Orange County motel in 1983. After the boy objected publicly 
to the release of his father to Orange County, corrections officials sent 
Rothenberg to an undisclosed location, placing him under 24-hour electronic 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
But the growing army of parolees has thus far received scant public attention. 
Parolees collect $200 at the prison gate and are sent out to their new lives in 
their home counties. 
</P>
<P>
Some state officials, though, have begun to suggest that the public should be 
concerned by these returning inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they (citizens) should be worried about it and they should be 
interested in substance abuse programming," said Jerry DiMaggio, who supervises 
most of the Los Angeles County parole officers. "The large increase is really 
being driven by drug abuse and drug abuse is what we have to address." 
</P>
<P>
DiMaggio blamed the lack of community-based substance abuse programs for a high 
recidivism rate among parolees. Studies have shown that 60% of the paroled 
inmates are sent back to prison within two years for using drugs, violating 
parole guidelines or committing other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), chairman of a legislative committee 
overseeing prison construction, said that he also believes the increasing 
number of parolees is cause for concern, especially because each parole officer 
is responsible for 53 returning criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The high caseload for parole officers is a "weakness" in the system, Presley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you have more parolees coming out, without the extra supervision, I 
would guess that you would have more crime," he said. "I don't think it's 
something you want to worry about, but you should be concerned." 
</P>
<P>

BEACHES STILL CLOSED AFTER WEEKEND'S SEWAGE SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA CHONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighteen miles of Los Angeles County coastline will remain closed at least 
through today while county health officials determine whether the water is safe 
for swimming after nearly 8 million gallons of sewage spilled into Santa Monica 
Bay over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Despite warning signs, the beach closures did not deter visitors Monday. For 
example, at Topanga State Beach, a number of people were enjoying their holiday 
on the sand. Several surfers, undaunted by the closure, braved the surf. 
Authorities did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials will test water samples -- taken from various points from 
Topanga Beach to the Palos Verdes peninsula -- for coliform bacteria, which 
survive for about 48 hours in saltwater and are indicators of hazardous wastes 
that can cause diarrhea and other intestinal problems. If the results show a 
continually high bacteria count, the beaches will remain closed longer, said 
Jack Petralia, director of environmental protection for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"Coliform only says that there may be a risk of disease and that's all," 
Petralia said. "They are an indicator of disease-causing organisms in the 
sewage. They can be caused by the soil, from animal droppings, and from other 
things, but the specific organisms which would cause the diseases would be 
viruses or bacteria." 
</P>
<P>
Since Monday's samples "may be high also," Petralia said beaches will probably 
not reopen until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But officials from Hyperion Treatment Plant in Playa Del Rey, which diverted 
the 7.6 million gallons of partly treated waste Saturday, said the beach water 
is safe because the sewage had been carefully treated with high dosages of 
chlorine, which lowered coliform counts. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion's environmental monitoring division, which conducts daily bacteria 
counts, reported that the coliform count was high after the sewage was first 
dumped, but the most recent tests showed that it had fallen dramatically, said 
Sam Cheng, the division's acting manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmentally, we did the best we could," Cheng said. "If there is another 
storm, it's possible that this (sewage overflow) will happen again. But at 
least we feel really good that we can provide a pretty good bacterial kill." 
</P>
<P>
Normally, much of the sewage from the area is routed to Ballona Creek, north of 
Playa del Rey, and is treated with chlorine there, said Hyperion plant manager 
John T. Crosse. But because the heavy rains from the recent storm added to the 
regular waste runoff, city officials ordered the sewage to be spilled into the 
ocean to prevent it from overflowing onto city streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are really trying to do is to educate the public that whatever ends up 
on the streets ends up in the ocean," said Hyperion plant manager John T. 
Crosse. "There are other places up and down the coast which discharge into 
Santa Monica Bay, but by far, Ballona is the biggest. We are looking at ways to 
deal with storm runoff, but that's still a major problem." 
</P>
<P>
Plagued with an aging sewage system and booming population growth, the city has 
periodically dumped waste into the bay and has launched a $4-billion campaign 
to reinforce normal sewage conditions and to deal with overflow from storms. 
But new sewage lines will not be completed until 1993, Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental activists, outraged about the sewage dumping, remain skeptical 
about how clean the water is. And many are not sure that chlorinated treatment 
of waste is the best solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better than nothing that we have this system, that they are doing some 
settling out of the waste and then clorinating the heck out of it," said Mark 
Gold, staff scientist for Heal the Bay. "But the thing is, no one looks at the 
consequences of the chlorine, which can produce a lot of toxic compounds. Is it 
really better to knock down some bacteria while producing toxic compounds at 
the same time?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, among the beachgoers at Topanga on Monday was Kenny Davis, 37, of 
Marlow, Okla. Two weeks ago, Davis arrived in Southern California, expecting to 
see "beautiful beaches." A few days after he arrived, the oil tanker American 
Trader dumped 394,000 gallons of oil onto the coast of Huntington Beach. A 
little more than a week later, sewage was dumped onto the beaches of Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother Nature, you've got to figure, she's got to be pretty mad at us now," 
Davis said.

<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District is offering many programs during the 
current school year that are designed to motivate, educate and train students 
-- from the very young through adulthood. Here are just a few of the programs 
offered in the nation's second-largest school system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aid for Homeless Students 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: The Coeur D'Alene Avenue Elementary School in Venice offers 
approximately 70 homeless students extra medical and psychological services, as 
well as a counselor who works mainly with parents to help them obtain social 
services. The program also offers computer-assisted instruction in reading and 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $70,000 grant from the Greater Los Angeles Partnership for the 
Homeless, a private nonprofit agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Basic Skills and Pre-Employment Class 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: The district offers pre-employment training -- including work to beef 
up basic education skills -- through an elective, credit class for 
approximately 125 students planning to get jobs after completing high school. 
Students work and attend classes simultaneously so the two experiences can be 
integrated. The program is coordinated with the Summer Youth Employment Program 
at Banning, Van Nuys, Fremont, Dorsey and Belmont High Schools. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: $357,030 in federal funds under the Job Training Partnership Act 
(JTPA). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s BEST 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Better Educated Students for Tomorrow is an after-school education and 
child-care program that began in 1988 at 10 schools, with three teachers and 
teacher's aides running the programs at each of the schools. The program was 
expanded in 1989 to include 15 schools, offering 3,000 elementary students a 
chance to learn and play in safety during after-school hours. In 1989, two new 
components were added: Four parents, who are longstanding community members, 
have recently been added at three of the 15 schools to encourage more parent 
participation and attract more students; and approximately 60 college students 
from three California State University branches are tutoring fifth- and sixth 
graders at seven of the schools. Some college students will volunteer, some 
will be paid $15 per week and others will receive class credits. Five new 
schools will be added in September, bringing the number in the program to 20. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A two-year, $2-million grant from the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency and a $500,000 grant from the Kaiser Permanente 
Foundation. California State Universities will pay the salaries of the students 
who tutor and will absorb some administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College-Bound Students 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: In this program, which is based at Montague Street School, 54 fifth- 
and sixth-grade minority students are encouraged to develop the skills, values 
and attitudes they will need to succeed in college. Students and their parents 
participate in field trips to local college campuses, and students receive 
T-shirts that identify them as "Kollege-Bound Kids." 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $2,222 grant from the California Educational Initiatives Fund 
(CEIF). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DARE After-School Alternative Program 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: An offshoot of the nationally known DARE program, which began in 1983 
as a tough anti-drug curriculum in the classroom and is now used in every 
elementary and junior high school and more than half of the high schools in Los 
Angeles. In the expanded, after-school DARE program, Muir Junior High School 
students are participating in a nationwide pilot program designed to enhance 
personal and social skills as well as to increase students' pride in 
themselves, their school and community. After school, students participate in 
sports, a modeling club, a video production club, drill team and a singing 
group called "DARE Up With Life." The program also provides field trips for 
cultural and educational enrichment. These students are not required to 
maintain the "C" average that is required of other students who participate in 
after-school sports. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A grant from the Nancy Reagan Foundation for $36,392. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FATHERS 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Twenty-five youths, ages 16 to -21, who are married or unmarried 
fathers, are trained for full-time employment in jobs that provide opportunity 
for advancement and help them understand parental responsibilities. Basic 
skills and parenting/family life classes are held at the Crenshaw-Dorsey 
Community Adult School. The Youth Intervention Program in South-Central Los 
Angeles also will provide training in cabinetmaking, scaffolding construction, 
computer literacy, computer repair and running a small business. The program's 
full name is Fathers, Academics, Technology, Health, Economics, Responsibility 
and Success. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $60,000 JTPA grant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Listen and Learn 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Students can phone in and hear prerecorded messages on drug abuse 
prevention, self-esteem and the value of education. On the line are celebrities 
such as Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser, the Lakers' Michael Cooper, Raiders 
tackle Bob Golic and disc jockey Rick Dees. There is also a homework hot line 
staffed by 13 college students from 3:30 to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday. 
Assistance information or help with personal problems is available 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week at (213) 250-4555 and (818) 548-9111. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $350,000 three-year grant from Great American Bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Part-Time Jobs Program 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Through the Los Angeles Youth Service Academy project, the city 
arranges jobs in the Department of Recreation and Parks for 1,000 students who 
are at risk of dropping out. This project offers clerical, custodial and 
computer programming positions, as well as work in carpentry, gardening and 
sports officiating. The students, ages 14-20, who are recommended for the 
program by counselors at 49 high schools, are required to be enrolled in a high 
school or a regional occupation center where vocational training is part of the 
curriculum. This project is scheduled to begin in late March. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $5-million donation from the Department of Water and Power for the 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pre-Genesis Program 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: Think of it as a head start for high schoolers. The purpose of this 
program is to help 180 youths improve their basic reading and employment skills 
so they can qualify for the Genesis program, which is designed to keep youths 
from dropping out. Students in Genesis are required to maintain a 2.5 
grade-point average and have a 90% attendance record at school during their 
senior year. Priority for enrollment in the pre-Genesis program is given to 
11th-grade students who are behind in graduation credits, read below grade 
level and have had little or no work experience. The Pre-Genesis program 
operates at Locke, Lincoln, Garfield, Roosevelt, Manual Arts and Jefferson high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: $380,000 in federal funds through the JTPA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
School Safety Program 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: This program is designed to reduce campus disruptions at two schools. 
At Jordan High School, students are trained as peer counselors skilled in 
conflict management and resolution. Virgil Junior High School's program 
includes crime awareness training for community members and production of a 
crime prevention video by the students. Approximately 2,700 students -- nearly 
two-thirds of the total student body of the two schools -- are expected to have 
participated by the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A $10,000 grant -- $5,000 each for Jordon and Virgil -- from the 
California School/Law Enforcement Partnership, a joint effort of the California 
State Department of Education and attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vision for Architecture 
</P>
<P>
PURPOSE: This effort, with the full name of Student Vision for 
Architecture/Built Environment Education Program, provides approximately 600 
first- through ninth-graders at 21 schools instruction from a teacher and a 
professional architect. The semester-long program aims at helping students 
learn the importance of working in harmony with the environment, recognize that 
they can affect the quality of the environment and gain problem-solving 
experience with real-life issues. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: Co-sponsored by the school district and the Los Angeles Chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects. Services of the architects are offered free 
to the district, and there are no other costs. 
</P>
<P>

shelter are provided with after-school tutoring and projects to boost 
self-esteem, additional school psychologist time and parent training at the 
Coeur D'Alene Avenue School. The program is designed to increase student 
attendance and parent participation in their children's education. Many of the 
students in this program also participate in the Aid for Homeless Students 
program at the school. 
</P>
<P>
FUNDING: A CEIF grant of $11,995.

SANTA BARBARA HANDS CLU ITS FIRST DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After running roughshod over its first four opponents, the Cal Lutheran 
baseball team lost, 7-5, against host UC Santa Barbara on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran, an NAIA District 3 school, allowed UCSB (8-5), an NCAA Division I 
school, to score two unearned runs in the first two innings, but battled back 
to a 2-2 tie in the fourth when Dan Weis and Tim Lewis scored on Mike 
Borzello's suicide squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
UCSB's Sean Luft hit a two-out, three-run home run in the seventh to put the 
Gauchos ahead, 7-2. Cal Lutheran, which managed only seven hits, rallied in the 
final two innings but left the bases loaded in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran designated hitter Peter Washington padded his .600-plus batting 
average with a two-for-three day. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Wimbish (0-1) took the loss in relief of Kevin O'Neill, who surrendered two 
earned runs in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor 5, Canyons 1 -- Canyons left 11 men on base in a semifinal game of the 
Casey Stengel Tournament, and Harbor turned two hits into four runs in the 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (6-2) scored in the bottom of the first when Ronnie Robart walked, 
advanced to third on an errant pitchout and scored on Gary Morgan's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
However, Harbor tied the game in the third, then took advantage of three walks, 
a hit batsman and a Canyons error in the fatal fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Adams (0-1) was the starter and loser for Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce 16, Compton 2 -- Pierce didn't score 20 runs in the first inning as it 
did in its first meeting with Compton, but did get all the runs it needed when 
first baseman Pat Fairly, son of former Dodger star Ron Fairly, hit a grand 
slam in the first inning of the home nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
Fairly, the cleanup hitter, hit his first home run of the season, and Pierce 
(5-3) hit four home runs. 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Tony Jordan hit a two-run shot in the second, third baseman Pat 
Houston knocked a three-run home run in the fourth and right fielder Mike 
Stephenson hit a two-run home run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan finished three for four with two stolen bases and scored four runs, and 
Pierce starter Kurt Lowry (3-1) earned the victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
The expansion Cleveland Crunch will be host to the 1992 Major Indoor Soccer 
League All-Star Game, Commissioner Earl Foreman said Monday in San Diego.

Granite Hills basketball coach Joe Roos said his team is lucky to be in the 
Section basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They are. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills, seeded 16th out of 16 teams, has the worst record (9-16) of any 
Division I boys' team allowed into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
But Granite Hills, led by 6-foot-6 Scott Goergens (21 points a game), may not 
feel very lucky tonight at about 8 p.m. when they are up to their elbows in 
full-court presses and slam dunks at No. 1-seeded Sweetwater. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very well-acquainted with Sweetwater," said Roos, whose Eagles lost to 
Sweetwater by 40 in a holiday tournament this year. "They have a tremendous 
defense -- it's absolutely stifling. 
</P>
<P>
"When we played them the last time, my best two players were going up for 
layups and they came without the ball. There was no foul or anything. They just 
took the ball away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Roos said he doubts his team will be intimidated by the quicker Red 
Devils, who come into the playoffs with the county's best record at 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
"The game shouldn't scare us, we've lost before," Roos said. "If my kids don't 
play afraid, we have a chance to beat them. But we shouldn't beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteenth-seeded Mission Bay (4-16) shouldn't beat No. 2-seeded San Pasqual 
(18-5) either Wednesday night in Division II play. But Mission Bay Coach Mike 
Seaman said that's what intrigues and excites him about the postseason 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids showed up for a 10 a.m. practice today at 9:15," Seaman said. "They 
realize they're getting an opportunity to play against one of the best players 
in the county in Eric Meek. Here's a kid they'll be seeing on television for 
years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Seaman, in his 13th year at Mission Bay, said he has reminded his young team of 
famous Buccaneer upsets to prepare them for the game at San Pasqual. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1985, we beat a heavily-favored El Camino in the Section semifinals, in '81 
we upset La Jolla and Ken Johnson (who later played in the NBA), and in '78 we 
beat Sweetwater and Mike Pitts (who starred at Cal Berkeley)," Seaman said. "I 
just wanted to let them know it can happen." 
</P>
<P>
Although Seaman realizes, it won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see us controlling Meek (29 points a game), but we've got to do a good 
job on the other four guys." 
</P>
<P>
In a first round that appears to be full of blow outs, the Fallbrook-Mira Mesa 
game actually looks like a decent match-up. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa (17-8) is seeded eighth in Division I and Fallbrook (16-10) is ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook Coach Russ Keith said the match-up would be even better if he had 6-6 
Travis Teagle, his leading rebounder and second leading scorer. Teagle, who 
averaged 14.6 points and eight rebounds, was injured last Thursday in practice 
and will be unavailable tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Nolan, a 6-5 junior, will be given the unenviable task of replacing Teagle 
and guarding Mira Mesa's Mark Ziegler (6-5), who averages 18.1 points and is 
one of the better big men in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Keith said he will need a big game from sophomore guard Chris Miller (18 points 
a game) and Nolan to have chance. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost three straight and without Travis, it's going to be an uphill 
battle," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
First round games in Division I and II will be played tonight and Wednesday at 
the higher seed's gymnasium. Winners will play Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
First-round girls play also begins tonight with the Division I and II top 
seeds, Mt. Carmel (18-5) and Point Loma (23-3) in action.

SAN DIEGO VERSION OF 'LOST IN SPACE' STARS 6 GROUPS IN SEARCH OF HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: ORGANIZATIONS VYING FOR PERFORMANCE AND EXHIBIT SPACE FIND REAL 
ESTATE IS A VALUABLE COMMODITY WHERE DEMAND OUTSTRIPS SUPPLY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The emphasis on Star Wars may be diminished as a result of the federal 
government's defense budget cuts, but the battle for space is still being 
fought in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
It's not defense contractors doing battle, it's a number of nonprofit arts 
organizations that are competing for a valuable commodity in this town -- real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than six groups are vying for space at two locations. 
</P>
<P>
In Balboa Park, the Museum of Photographic Arts and the Mingei International 
Museum of World Folk Art are competing for the Casa de Balboa space now 
occupied by the Hall of Champions, which is almost certainly moving to the 
Federal Building. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the Great American Bank Plaza being built across from the downtown 
Amtrak station, space that has been dedicated for arts use is being pursued by 
four organizations: the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art, the Visual Arts 
Foundation, the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater and the Bowery Theater. The space 
was at one time considered by both the Children's Museum and MOPA. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Museum pulled out of the Great American complex to pursue space 
in Balboa Park's House of Charm, which it has since been granted by the City 
Council. And MOPA pulled out because an agreement for the museum's needs could 
not be reached with the developers. 
</P>
<P>
MOPA would like the Hall of Champions space next to the museum's current home 
for an expansion, but there's a catch: the Hall of Champions space has 
unofficially been dedicated to the Mingei, which has outgrown its quarters in 
University Towne Centre and had unsuccessfully sought space in the House of 
Charm. 
</P>
<P>
Got that straight? 
</P>
<P>
While that drama unfolds, the competition for the coveted Great American space 
is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
Starboard Development Corp. and Great American are considering four proposals 
for their dedicated space. Because it is a Centre City Development Corp. 
project, the developers must set aside 1% of their construction budget for art. 
</P>
<P>
Allocating exhibit or performance space is a departure from the more common 
practice of purchasing three-dimensional art in a new development. 
</P>
<P>
But the Starboard developers chose to avoid buying art, knowing full well the 
controversies that often arise in choosing and placing such work. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just chosen to do more of a living art exhibit, as opposed to sculpture 
or a statue," said Starboard spokesman Gary Stougaard. "We've got about 40,000 
feet of retail space, and the art component would take about 10,000 of that." 
</P>
<P>
Stougaard estimated the contribution to the art space would total at least $1.1 
million. In addition to the Great American building, the complex will include a 
Guest Quarters Suite Hotel. Between the two structures, spanning C Street, is a 
pavilion that will serve as a trolley station with surrounding retail space. 
The dedicated art space is on the second floor of the pavilion and the entire 
complex is scheduled for completion at the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art has a dual interest in the site: as a 
temporary home while its La Jolla facility is closed in early 1991 for an 
expansion expected to take 14 months and, following the expansion, as an 
adjunct downtown space, since the museum recently lost the lease on its former 
downtown gallery on G Street. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, we'd need 5,000 square feet for exhibitions and 5,000 of 
administrative space," said the museum's director, Hugh Davies. "Long term, we 
want to maintain a downtown presence. My fondest hope is that we would be a 
strong enough presence to maintain a 5,000-square-foot space after we return to 
La Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
Davies is especially interested in the space because his first choice for a 
temporary home -- the B Street Pier space renovated for the ill-fated Georgian 
icon exhibit at the Soviet arts festival -- is apparently off limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We offered to pay as much as $2,000 a month (for the pier space)," Davies 
said. "If there was a problem, we thought at least that would give us a leg 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor and members of the San Diego Unified Port District, 
which financed the pier space renovation to the tune of $700,000, had agreed 
that it would be used by various organizations after the festival. But former 
Port District Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer, who Davies thought was his strongest 
ally, said there was a problem with Davies' request for an extended period. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can lend it out for a long-term use," said Wolfsheimer, 
before his resignation last month from the commission. "We didn't build it to 
have someone exclusively use it for a long-term period. I think there will be 
other city and countywide events that will need it." 
</P>
<P>
Davies said that, in the long run, maybe the pier isn't ideal. 
</P>
<P>
"Some things we do may be too controversial," he said, a reference to the Port 
District's rocky history with commissioning public art projects. 
</P>
<P>
Another clue to the pier's unavailability came when the mayor returned recently 
from a trip to the Soviet Union and announced that she had reached tentative 
agreement with the director of the Armory Museum for three Soviet exhibitions 
at the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three organizations are vying with the La Jolla Museum for the Great 
American space. 
</P>
<P>
The Bowery Theatre, which is housed in a 76-seat house in the Kingston Hotel 
(believed to be the smallest Equity theater in the country), is looking for a 
larger space. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a verbal agreement to manage the Kingston space for the next three 
years, but this does not represent a permanent home by any means," said the 
theater's managing director, Mickey Mullany. "We're definitely still pursuing 
permanent space." 
</P>
<P>
The Reuben H. Fleet Space Theatre and Science Center is interested in the site 
as an adjunct to its museum in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of our own master planning, it represents an opportunity to do 
something that we had not planned until the year 2000," said Jeffrey Kirsch, 
executive director of the space center. "Our focus would be to have a high-tech 
motion picture theater for relatively small audiences -- about 150-200 people 
-- and space for state-of-the-art exhibits. Whoever is involved has a great 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the running is the Visual Arts Foundation, which wants to operate a 
cinematheque -- a theater dedicated to showcasing motion pictures other than 
first-run features, in a museum setting. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to have a complex for a cinema center that would house two to three 
auditoriums, a cafe, gift shop and poster gallery," said foundation Executive 
Director Andy Friedenberg, who also operates the for-profit Cinema Society. 
(Both of Friedenberg's enterprises offer their programs at the La Jolla 
museum.) "We would put on film programs ranging from children's series, 
festivals, tributes, faculty and student films, and classics." 
</P>
<P>
However, the foundation and the space theater may both face some of the same 
roadblocks MOPA encountered. The photo museum wanted to start a film program to 
complement its photographic mission, but the space wasn't big enough, according 
to MOPA Executive Director Arthur Ollman. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need can't really be accommodated well in that space," Ollman said. 
"We needed a 350-400 seat theater, suitable height clearances and a facility 
that was available day and night. Unfortunately, through all of our best 
efforts on both sides, it wasn't able to come about. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to have the Hall of Champions space, if and when they decide to move 
out. But it's already been promised to the Mingei. But, if (the Mingei) found 
something they liked better, it would solve all our problems." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hall of Champions board member Ron Fowler, there's a "very high 
probability" they will move. Architectural and engineering studies have been 
done, and the funds for their proposed move and expansion are in place. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Mingei, it first balked at the 18,000-square-foot Hall of Champions 
space when it lost out on the House of Charm, where it had hoped to have most 
of the available 48,000 square feet. But now, Mingei Executive Director Martha 
Longenecker seems willing to accept the smaller space, leaving the photo museum 
in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned for another adventure of "Lost in Space."

DISPUTED CALL PROVES COSTLY FOR USC, 64-62; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FIVE-SECOND VIOLATION LETS MARYLAND SET UP WINNING BASKET. 
TROJANS' MINER MISSES SHOT AT BUZZER.

<TEXT>
<P>
USC Coach George Raveling did his best to maintain his composure after a 
controversial five-second call led to a 64-62 loss to Maryland on Monday at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 62-62, USC guard Robert Pack was dribbling about 25 feet from 
the basket as the Trojans tried to set up a play. Maryland guard Teyon McCoy 
was playing about five feet off Pack. 
</P>
<P>
But it was close enough for referee Bobby Dibler, who called a five-second 
violation on Pack, giving Maryland the ball with 52.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
What did Raveling think of the call? 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for the gag rule (against criticizing officials) because they'd have 
two coaches in this town in trouble with the officials," Raveling said. UCLA 
Coach Jim Harrick is on Pacific 10 Conference probation for such criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"I will say this, though, I'm willing to bet some big-time money that Robert 
Pack wasn't closely guarded. If I didn't know better I'd have thought the game 
was at College Park (Md.), and I'll let you read into that." 
</P>
<P>
Raveling said he thought Dibler didn't properly interpret the five-second rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The man has to be closely guarded and there's no way (Pack) was closely 
guarded on that," Raveling said. "In fact, he wasn't even guarded, and that's 
what makes it such an absurd play. (McCoy) was sagging off trying to keep us 
from getting the ball inside to (Ronnie) Coleman." 
</P>
<P>
Pack agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't pressuring me tightly at all," Pack said. "I don't think he was 
close enough to call five seconds. When I heard the whistle I was wondering 
what the call was. I thought it was a foul down low." 
</P>
<P>
But it was a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
The Terrapins ran the clock down to 21.9 seconds before calling time out. 
Maryland worked the ball to guard Walt Williams, who made a jumper over Calvin 
Banks from slightly inside the free-throw line to give Maryland a two-point 
lead with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"We executed the final play to perfection and then we played great defense in 
the final eight seconds," Maryland Coach Gary Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
USC called a timeout with 8.6 seconds left to set up a play, but guard Harold 
Miner missed an off-balance 18-foot jumper as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew the final play was going to Miner," Gary Williams said. "When you have 
a great player like that, you have to use him. The kid is going to be a great 
player because he has a lot of courage." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Miner was the second option on the final play. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans had planned to use Miner, who scored 25 points, as a decoy and let 
Pack take the last shot, but Pack couldn't get open. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a whole lot of time," Raveling said. "It just didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Miner said he was forced to alter his shot because of defensive pressure from 
forward Jerrod Mustaf. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to block the shot so I had to readjust," Miner said. 
</P>
<P>
Center Tony Massenburg led Maryland with 20 points and 11 rebounds and forward 
Mustaf had 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by eight points, the Trojans outscored Maryland, 10-2, to make the 
score 40-40. Coleman, who had 20 points, scored eight points in the spurt 
before going to the bench after picking up his third foul. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our kids did a great job of coming right back at the start of the 
half and putting ourselves back into a competitive position to win the game," 
Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC, which dropped its second consecutive game, fell to 9-13. Six of USC's 
defeats have been by six points or fewer. Maryland, which ended a four-game 
losing streak by beating North Carolina Saturday, is 15-11. USC Coach George 
Raveling, who withdrew as a candidate for the Maryland job before Coach Gary 
Williams was hired last June, thinks Williams is doing a doing a good job with 
the Terrapins, who were picked to finish last in the Atlantic Coast Conference. 
"Maryland's a fine team," Raveling said. "I can see how they beat North 
Carolina. They have three NBA draft choices in (Walt) Williams, (Tony) 
Massenburg and (Jerrod) Mustaf." . . . Center Chris Munk had 12 rebounds and 
forward Calvin Banks grabbed 10 as USC outrebounded Maryland, 52-34. . . . The 
Trojans shot a season-low .302, making just 19 of 63 shots.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
They don't have a scorer or rebounder in the top 10. They aren't first in any 
individual or team statistical department. Only in won-loss record do the 
Lakers lead the NBA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers are opportunists," Boston Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers said. "That's 
what they're all about. You can't afford to make a mistake against them." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac might have been the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft instead of No. 26 
if scouts knew what they do today. I mean, would you rather have him or Pervis 
Ellison? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' top spot in the league could be in jeopardy this week. A game and a 
half ahead of Portland, they must face San Antonio and Denver on the road on 
consecutive nights and then Philadelphia and Utah at the Forum. Meanwhile, 
Portland is stuck on the road, but against Charlotte, Cleveland, Chicago and 
Indiana. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who got booed the loudest during pregame introductions at the Forum Sunday? 
Larry Bird or Kevin McHale, you say? No. Referee Jake O'Donnell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most Forum fans don't even bother trying to rattle Bird at the free-throw line 
anymore. They know it won't do any good. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Overlooked in the Lakers' victory was the inspired performance of Orlando 
Woolridge off the bench. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Watching Michael Cooper play defense is more interesting than watching most 
guys play offense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One reason for UCLA's slump is poor outside shooting. The Bruins are 12 for 49 
from three-point range in their past three games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't confuse the dollars of a James (Buster) Douglas-Evander Holyfield fight 
with those of a Douglas-Mike Tyson rematch. Not even close. Douglas is a huge 
attraction only in the same ring with Tyson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, it is refreshing to see someone in boxing, Douglas' manager John 
Johnson, finally stand up to Don King. . . . 
</P>
<P>
While negotiations for Douglas-Holyfield continue, Johnson has scheduled a 
meeting in Las Vegas with George Foreman adviser Ron Weathers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The NHL would not have been out of line to suspend Laurie Boschman of Winnipeg 
for the rest of the season instead of eight games for his vicious attack on 
Tomas Sandstrom of the Kings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The entire St. Louis Blues roster won't be paid as much as Will Clark this 
year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster on his recent fall in the shower: "Maybe I should wear a 
helmet." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Unless he's traded before the Thursday deadline, Dallas Maverick forward Sam 
Perkins will be the most sought-after free agent in the league after the 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bill Buckner, who signed a minor league contract with the Red Sox, is getting a 
bum rap from the media and Boston fans. He should be remembered for more than 
his error in the World Series against the Mets. Here's a natural who will be 
able to hit a line drive 20 years after he retires. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally ought to enter his exceptional mare, Bayakoa, in the Santa 
Anita Handicap. We're not exactly talking about one of the greatest Big 'Cap 
fields ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera's Kentucky Derby candidate Mister Frisky equaled Man o' War's 
winning streak when he won his 14th in a row at Santa Anita. Now he is aiming 
at Citation's record of 16. . . . 
</P>
<P>
On a rainy Saturday afternoon in Arcadia, Santa Anita ticket sellers were 
advised not to sell any reserved seats below row 7. Anything above that is 
protected by the roof. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Proud papa: All seven children of Joe Pimentel, twin brother of former 
bantamweight contender Jesus and not a bad featherweight himself, are either 
attending college or have graduated. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Patterson, 55, looked more like 45 when interviewed on ESPN the other 
night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Wright State Raiders of Dayton, Ohio, boast the best record of any 
independent in the nation at 18-5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Honeymooning at The Lodge in Pebble Beach are Jeanie Buss, daughter of Jerry, 
and two-time U.S. Olympic volleyball gold medalist Steve Timmons. Best man at 
the Valentine's Day wedding in Carmel was Timmons' former teammate Karch 
Kiraly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're still swimming competitively at 25, you're a senior citizen who is 
eligible for masters' meets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pat Haden would have been a terrific quarterback in the San Francisco 49ers' 
system. . . . Nevada Las Vegas forward Larry Johnson deserves consideration as 
college basketball player of the year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to Mark Macon, the Temple guard who was supposed to be the 
next Oscar Robertson? . . . 
</P>
<P>
I sure miss those pictures in the paper of ballplayers doing sit-ups in Florida 
and Arizona.

Indiana Coach Bob Knight watched some good defensive basketball Monday night, 
but most of it was played by Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play badly defensively," said Knight after the ninth-ranked 
Boilermakers beat the No. 25 Hoosiers, 72-49, at West Lafayette, Ind., to 
maintain sole possession of the Big Ten Conference lead. 
</P>
<P>
"But, if we played decent defensively, they played extremely well. Their 
defense dominated our offense the vast majority of the time," said Knight, 
whose team shoot only 39%. 
</P>
<P>
Said Purdue Coach Gene Keady: "It's not very often you get to play a big rival 
and play that well on defense. I thought that was the best defense we've played 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
It was Purdue's biggest margin of victory over its archrival since a 120-76 
victory in 1969. The outcome might have been more one-sided if the 
Boilermakers, who were led by Stephen Scheffler's 18 points, had not cleared 
their bench with five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue (19-4, 11-2 in the conference) opened a one-game lead over Michigan 
State as it swept the Hoosiers (16-7, 6-7) for the first time since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Connecticut 75, Providence 72 -- The legend of Nadav Henefeld, already 
sizable in Connecticut, grew again when the former Israeli soldier made a 
three-point shot at the buzzer in overtime to lead the Huskies in a Big 
Conference game at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Henefeld, a 6-foot-7, 21-year-old freshman, had four steals and a team-leading 
nine rebounds, but shot poorly most of the game, finishing with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
But with two seconds left on the 45-second clock, Tate George found Henefeld at 
the top of the key for an open jump shot that bounced off the rim, touched the 
backboard and dropped through. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved the Huskies (23-4, 10-3) ahead of Georgetown (9-3) for first 
place in the conference. The Friars dropped to 14-9 and 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin 82, Marquette 65 -- At Madison, Wis., Danny Jones scored 19 points 
and the Badgers got 10 points as a result of five technical fouls called on the 
Warriors in the 96th meeting of the intrastate rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Wisconsin (13-14) opened the second half with a 17-6 run after leading, 32-29, 
at halftime. Tim Locum added 17 points as Wisconsin beat Marquette (12-11) for 
the fifth consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
Marquette Coach Kevin O'Neill was ejected after picking up his second technical 
with 15 seconds left. He paused to shake hands of players and coaches on the 
Wisconsin bench as he left the court. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State 89, Fresno State 83 -- Darrel White scored a career-high 25 points 
and Kendall Youngblood added 20 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Aggies in a 
Big West Conference game at Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (14-11, 8-6) jumped to a 13-8 lead with 15:16 left in the half and 
never trailed. Fresno State is 9-14 and 4-10.

UCLA LOSES ANOTHER ASSISTANT: ROBINSON TAKES JOB WITH JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Robinson, UCLA's offensive coordinator last season and an assistant to 
Coach Terry Donahue for eight seasons, has been named defensive line coach of 
the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 38, is the fifth assistant to leave UCLA since the end of a 3-7-1 
season, the Bruins' worst in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue has filled two of the positions with offensive coordinator Homer Smith 
and defensive line coach Jacob Burney. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was the defensive line coach for seven seasons in Westwood before 
being switched to offensive coordinator last season, when the Bruins were 
ranked ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference in total offense, accumulating their 
lowest rushing yardage total since 1964 and their lowest passing yardage total 
since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Robinson was named assistant head coach and moved back to defense 
to coach linebackers. UCLA was ranked among the nation's top eight in rushing 
defense three times in Robinson's last four seasons as coach of the defensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The move to New York, he said, presented an opportunity to work with some of 
his closest friends. The Jets' defensive coordinator, Pete Carroll, was 
Robinson's teammate at Pacific. They coached together at Pacific and North 
Carolina State, where the head coach was Monte Kiffin, who is the Jets' 
linebacker coach. The Jets' head coach, Bruce Coslet, also played at Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes my career to another level," Robinson said. JERRY CROWE

OWNERS DROP SALARY CAP DEMAND; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BUT NEGOTIATOR FOR PLAYERS SAYS KEY ISSUE IS REDUCING ELIGIBILITY FOR 
ARBITRATION FROM THREE TO TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball's owners have made a second concession in the collective bargaining 
negotiations, removing their proposed 75% cap on arbitrated salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to the firm refusal of the Major League Players Assn. to accept the 
concept of a cap, Charles O'Connor, general counsel of the owners' Player 
Relations Committee, said Monday that the major debate involves arbitration 
eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the owners removed revenue sharing as the major issue. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the talks, which resumed with two sessions Monday, 
predicted that a bargaining agreement would be reached by Thursday, allowing 
the spring training camps to open by the mandatory reporting date of Feb. 28. 
</P>
<P>
The owners' lockout has reached Day 6. The first exhibition games are scheduled 
for March 1, and Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said Monday that the 
lockout was "very close" to a point where the first games would be threatened 
by the absence of preparatory time. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr also said that unless an agreement was reached soon, the lockout could 
linger because he would have to recess negotiations while he traveled to 
Arizona and Florida to update players. 
</P>
<P>
Fehr downplayed the removal of the 75% arbitration cap. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you there's been any progress on the remaining issues," he said. 
"We have consistently told them that we won't accept any agreement that 
contains a cap. The key issue is what it has always been, the status of players 
with less than three years of service." 
</P>
<P>
The union is attempting to lower the eligibility requirement for arbitration 
from three years of major league service to two, which is what it was before 
the labor negotiations of 1985. That was when the union agreed to add a year as 
concession to owners' claims of financial distress. 
</P>
<P>
Now, citing the game's prosperity, the union wants the year back, but many 
familiar with the negotiations believe the final compromise will find the union 
agreeing to retain the three-year rule in exchange for an increase in minimum 
salary from $68,000 to $100,000, return of the 25-man roster (rather than 24), 
and immediate free agency for players outrighted to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said that arbitration eligibility remains the problem and that many 
owners strongly oppose rolling it back to two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a middle ground," he said, adding there is a basis for 
overall optimism in that the two sides are discussing traditional issues that 
have been resolved before. "The solutions are there. We should be able to find 
them," he said.

THE PREPS: FOOTBALL POWERS DORSEY AND LOYOLA HAVE BEEN IMPRESSIVE IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the high school basketball playoffs move into the quarterfinal round this 
week, two schools unaccustomed to being favorites remain in contention. 
</P>
<P>
In the City 4-A Division, Dorsey (19-6) stepped forward as a strong title 
contender when it defeated Pacific League rival and defending State champion 
Crenshaw, 91-67, to close the regular season and then opened the playoffs with 
a 66-50 victory over Woodland Hills Taft last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern Section 5-A Division, second-seeded Loyola (20-3) has reeled 
off impressive playoff victories over Thousand Oaks, 102-73, and Victor Valley, 
83-60. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey and Loyola, which are less than two miles apart, are each known more for 
football success. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, which won the City 4-A Division football title last fall, has only 
reached the City basketball finals once. It has made it to the semifinals twice 
in the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In football, Loyola has won three Southern Section titles and is always seeded 
in the playoffs, but in basketball the Cubs have never advanced beyond the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Still, both Dorsey and Loyola had high expectations for this basketball season 
because each had several key players back from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, which finished 13-9 last season, began the season strong, reaching two 
tournament finals before losing to host schools Manual Arts and Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
With an all-senior starting lineup, the Dons feature a balanced attack led by 
6-foot-8 center James Bacon, who will attend Fresno State this fall. Bacon 
leads the team in rebounding (8.6 per game) and is second in scoring (12.1). 
</P>
<P>
The Dons have a solid backcourt in 6-1 Tim Cage, who leads the team with a 15.7 
scoring average, and Kareen Sconiers, who averages 11.3 points and 6.6 assists 
per game. Joining Bacon in the frontcourt is 6-6 Tony Booten and 6-4 Wayne 
Currie, who combine to average 20 points and 15 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
With its full-court trapping defense, Dorsey's strong bench plays a major role. 
Among the reserves is junior Lamont Warren, the City football 4-A Division 
player of the year last fall. Others off the bench include guards Lynell 
Wiggins, Albert Almani and swingmen Shande Fritz and Kirone Sims. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good experience in that everyone of our starters played last year," 
said Dorsey Coach Dave Gordan, who is in his 14th year as coach. "A key for us 
that we are bigger than most teams we play, and we have better depth." 
</P>
<P>
Another key reason for the Dons' basketball success has been the work of their 
assistants Kevin Gibson, Chris Butler, Edmond Fluornoy and Don Muepo. 
</P>
<P>
"They (assistants) are responsible for getting the program started again," 
Gordan said. "The attitude of the whole team has been great with everyone 
working hard in practices and in the games." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, which won its only City title in 1976, has won several big games this 
season, including victories over City rivals Washington and Fremont, but its 
biggest win was its rout of Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
Can Dorsey become the first school ever to win major division City titles in 
both football and basketball in the same school year? 
</P>
<P>
"This is the year it can be done," Gordan said, whose Dons play at Carson 
Wednesday. "There is a lot of balance in the City this year and we matchup well 
with everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Like Dorsey, Loyola also has an experienced team headed by 6-11 center Ryan 
Jamison, who signed with California last November. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola, which features an offense similar to the one used by Loyola Marymount, 
starts five seniors who average double figures in scoring. Jamison leads the 
team in scoring (19.5), rebounding (10.9) and blocked shots (3.5). 
</P>
<P>
Against Victor Valley, Jamison, who is shooting 67% from the field, scored 18 
points and set a school-record with 28 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
At forwards, the Cubs start 6-6 Jamal Adams, who averages 15.7 points, 10.1 
rebounds and 3 blocks per game, and 6-6 Joe Burghardt, who averages 12 points 
and 4.5 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
In the backcourt, the Cubs start 6-2 Eric Jones, a nifty point guard who 
averages seven assists and less than two turnovers a game, and 6-3 Okwi 
Anuluoha, who averages 10 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
After losing two early round games in the Ocean View Tournament of Champions 
and the championship final of the Beach Ball Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C., the 
Cubs went on to win the Del Rey League title and have won 13 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to play a fast-pace tempo game," Loyola Coach Bill Thomason said. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola plays Huntington Beach Ocean View at Fountain Valley High tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
The National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame will have George Allen as 
keynote speaker at its 27th annual banquet March 3, honoring top high school 
football scholar-athletes in Los Angeles County. Players to be honored include 
Chris Afarain of Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, Todd Kusserow and John Aylsworth of 
Santa Monica, Adam Barlow of Newhall Hart, Clint Beauer of Canyon Country

COLOMBIANS REJECT EXTRA SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having determined that death threats against its coach, players and their 
families were unfounded, the Colombian Soccer Federation rejected an offer for 
extra security during the team's stay in Los Angeles this week for the Marlboro 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more difficult to play soccer with bodyguards all over the place," 
Colombia Coach Francisco Maturana said Monday. "We want to get (the threats) 
out of our minds." 
</P>
<P>
He said the players should turn their attention to soccer, starting tonight 
when Colombia meets the Soviet Union at 7 in a match between World Cup 
qualifiers. Another World Cup qualifier, Costa Rica, plays a Mexican 
professional team, Chivas of Guadalajara, at 9. 
</P>
<P>
The winners will play for the championship Thursday night after a match between 
the losers for third place. All games are scheduled for the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself Purge Colombian Soccer issued the threats two weeks ago 
against Maturana as well as national team members who are under contract to 
professional teams allegedly connected with the drug cartels and their 
families. Most of the national team players also are members of the four teams 
specified. The group reportedly lost money betting on those teams. 
</P>
<P>
During a break in the team's schedule, Colombia's president, Virgilio Barco, 
instructed the country's security minister, General Miguel Maza, to 
investigate. When it was determined that the team was not in danger, the 
players gathered last week at Boca Raton, Fla., to train for this tournament, 
and the president of the soccer federation, Leon Londono Tamayo, went to Italy 
to assure organizers that Colombia will participate in this summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of uncertainty, rumors and doubt," Maturana said through an 
interpreter. "The situation still isn't ideal, but it has calmed down." 
</P>
<P>
Maturana, who coached Colombia into the World Cup for the first time in 28 
years, denied reports that he considered resigning because of the threats. He 
said the team will continue training as scheduled except for the cancellation 
of games in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets are making their first appearance in the United States. After this 
tournament, they play the United States on Saturday at Stanford.

WORKING MOMS: Working Mother magazine listed America's "Ten Best Cities for 
Working Moms," but omitted Irvine, which in the past has received accolades for 
its commitment to child care. . . . That's OK, says Irvine child-care 
coordinator Nancy Noble, "they just don't know about us." . . . She concedes, 
however, that the county is behind the child-care curve, with only Irvine and 
Anaheim having child-care coordinators. "The county, traditionally, because of 
its conservative nature, has been a little slower on child care, mainly because 
it considered it a private sector thing." Dana Parsons and Kristina Lindgren

SILBERMAN LEAVES HOSPITAL, EXPECTED TO RETURN HOME

<P>
Indicted businessman Richard T. Silberman, whose two-day disappearance ended 
when he was found unconscious in a Las Vegas hotel room, walked out the 
hospital Monday and was expected to return to San Diego to resume his fight 
against federal money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was released from the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada 
about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
He walked out with his arm around his wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan 
Golding, and kissed her just before they got into a rental car driven by San 
Francisco attorney James Brosnahan. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman declined to answer reporters' questions. Golding also declined 
comment and asked a television cameramen to back away as the couple walked to 
the car. The couple gave no indication of where they were going. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman had been at the hospital since police found him suffering from an 
apparent drug overdose in a room at the Las Vegas Hilton. Police had been 
searching for the San Diego financier since he was reported missing Friday by 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas authorities have said there is not enough information to indicate if 
Silberman tried to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego Police Department, said that 
Silberman was not considered a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan, who spoke to reporters Monday morning, would not comment on why 
Silberman had fled to Las Vegas, although he has said that Silberman's 
disappearance and current condition resulted from alleged prejudicial 
statements made by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
He said Silberman had become upset after reading a newspaper story in which the 
judge was quoted as saying comments Silberman made to FBI agents immediately 
after his arrest last April were "self-incriminating." 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan said there had been no change in any court appearance for Silberman, 
although he indicated the three-day weekend may have had some effect on that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
We're "looking at the effect of the situation on future court appearances," 
Brosnahan said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney has indicated that U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving may be 
biased against Silberman, but has not said if he will ask for a new judge to 
preside over Silberman's scheduled April 10 trial. 
</P>
<P>
He said Irving overstepped his judicial powers when he found in a pretrial 
decision that Silberman incriminated himself. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no hearing for it," Brosnahan said Sunday. "There was no legal basis 
for it. . . . The papers and the judge in San Diego want him crucified." 
</P>
<P>
Irving could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman remains free on $500,000 bail posted earlier. He turned in his 
passport but had no travel restrictions within the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He is accused of participating in a money-laundering scheme with reputed San 
Diego mobster Chris Petti and three others involving $300,000 from an 
undercover FBI agent who was posing as an associate of Colombian cocaine 
traffickers.

A mass of black sludge 20 miles long, believed to be algae, washed up on Long 
Island beaches Monday and left the shoreline littered with dead shellfish.

<P>
The odorless scum, which the Coast Guard at first thought might be oil, was 
spotted early Monday in the Atlantic Ocean off Robert Moses State Park on Fire 
Island, 20 miles east of New York City. Hours later, the slick had reached 20 
miles east to Smith Point, authorities said.

A woman died 18 hours after doctors at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in 
Hershey, Pa., tried to save her life by using an experimental, temporary 
lung-assist device. 
</P>

The woman, identified only as a 34-year-old Philadelphian, was the second

PITTSTON STRIKE MAY BE ENDING AS COAL MINERS VOTE ON PACT

<P>
Appalachian coal miners voted Monday on a contract with Pittston Coal Group 
that could end an acrimonious 10-month strike that drew international support 
from labor organizations. 
</P>
<P>
United Mine Workers Vice President Cecil Roberts planned to announce the result 
of the vote this morning at the union's southwest Virginia district office, UMW 
spokesman Gene Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
A simultaneous announcement was planned at the AFL-CIO convention in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
James Hicks, president of Local 1259 in Cleveland, Va., said he was optimistic 
that the contract would be accepted. Many of the rank-and-file union members 
who voted in Virginia agreed that the overwhelming majority appeared to favor 
ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tentative agreement, Pittston would continue to pay 100% of miners' 
health-care coverage, rather than forcing them to assume 20% of the cost. 
Pittston would also continue paying into an industry-wide pension fund from 
which it had withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The company won the right to operate shifts around the clock and to suspend 13 
workers accused of illegal strike activity and force them to go to arbitration 
if they want to keep their jobs.

AFTER 11 DAYS AT BAY, SAILORS WELCOME HARBOR REOPENING 
</P>

Less than 10 minutes after a gray Harbor Patrol boat pulled away the orange 
boom sheltering Newport Harbor, Colin McDonald and Brad Downey were at sea on 
their way to New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, the Newport Harbor-based duo had planned a Feb. 17 
departure aboard their 45-foot sailboat, Nipigon. But after the bon voyage 
party Saturday, the four-man crew was stranded in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is just getting out the door," McDonald said as he watched Harbor 
Patrol boats circle in preparation for the 2:05 p.m. opening of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The county's busiest harbor had been closed since Feb. 8, when crude oil from a 
tanker spill the day before off Huntington Beach drifted down the coast. But 
after nearly two weeks of restricting boaters to the bay, and with the cleanup 
winding down, officials gave the go-ahead Monday to reopen the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A red Harbor Patrol boat escorted the first vessel, a four-deck cruiser, to 
sea. About a dozen boats that had been waiting in the wings followed the 
cruiser closely, as workers hauled the boom onto rocks that line the channel. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a quick efficient job of cleaning it up," said Eddie DiRuscio, 
manager of Davey's Locker Sportfishing in Balboa. "I am just tickled pink that 
they've opened the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
Between 300 and 500 people usually head to sea each day to parasail, fish and 
watch whales on Davey's Locker boats, but with the harbor closed, all trips 
were canceled. Missing two three-day weekends hurt the business financially, 
but DiRuscio said that he was glad officials took precautions to protect the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Business will resume today at Davey's Locker and at Catalina Passenger Service, 
whose catamaran cruises carry up to 500 passengers at a time on whale-watching 
excursions or trips to Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
As sailboats and cabin cruisers headed up the coast, residents and tourists 
were allowed on the beach between the Wedge at the end of the peninsula and 
15th Street. 
</P>
<P>
On the sunny holiday afternoon, hundreds of people strolled on the shore, made 
sandcastles or just sat. A few of the more adventurous braved the chilly water. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Berney, a Newport Harbor High School senior who lives in a beachfront 
house, said he is happy the beach is open but does not plan to go into the 
water for a while, even to skim-board. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's a wise idea until they make sure it's safe," Berney 
said.

OIL CLEANUP IS TOPIC OF SCIENTIFIC SESSION

<P>
Eighteen months ago when they selected Newport Beach for their conference, 
three University of Massachusetts scientists had no idea how appropriate the 
choice would become. 
</P>
<P>
Today, while workers sweep spilled crude oil from Newport's beaches, the 
conference will discuss the latest in oil pollution cleanup technology and 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
And the featured speaker, signed up for more than a year, will be Peter 
Leathard, president of the company in charge of the cleanup in Newport and 
Huntington Beach. Leathard's topic: "The Prince William Sound Oil Spill -- Are 
You Prepared?" 
</P>
<P>
Leathard's firm, Veco Inc. of Anchorage, Alaska, managed the Prince William 
Sound cleanup caused by the tanker Valdez's running aground. The conference 
program, printed months ago, says Leathard would discuss in detail "what would 
have happened if the spill occurred offshore of Los Angeles and what could be 
done to prepare for such a spill." 
</P>
<P>
The Feb. 7 spill off Huntington Beach will make the discussion a lot less 
theoretical, said Charles E. Bell, one of the conference organizers. "I don't 
doubt (Leathard) will talk about this cleanup. It's a hot topic." 
</P>
<P>
Leathard is scheduled to speak during a 7 p.m. banquet today at the Sheraton 
Hotel-Newport Beach. Huntington Beach Fire Chief Raymond C. Picard is expected 
to appear as well and answer questions about the local cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the conference, which ends Thursday, is concerned with the 
technical and policy aspects of soil and ground water contamination, which 
usually comes from leaking storage tanks. STEVE EMMONS

BIDS SOUGHT FOR WIDENING OF BRIDGE

<P>
The city is seeking bids for the widening of Rancho Viejo Road's Trabuco Creek 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
As projected in the city's master plan, the 25-year-old, two-lane bridge, 
originally built by Caltrans, will be widened to four lanes with a median and 
space for a bicycle path. 
</P>
<P>
The 211-foot-long bridge is located near Rosenbaum Road in the northern part of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the bridge will be 84 feet wide between curbs, and Rancho Viejo 
Road will be four lanes all the way to Junipero Serra Road, according to Tom 
Lynch, a consultant for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The project will also include remodeling a small section of the county bicycle 
trail that runs along Trabuco Creek beneath the bridge. The trail is part of 
the county master plan of trails and winds up at Doheny State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch estimates that the new bridge will cost about $1.8 million. The city has 
set an eight-month deadline for completion of the project. Sealed bids are due 
by 2 p.m. March 15. 
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the city is seeking a state grant to build an equestrian bridge 
next to the new Trabuco Creek bridge, Lynch said. State officials have 
indicated that $90,000 has been added to the state budget for the equestrian 
bridge but the money has not been allocated, Lynch said.LEN HALL

ZONING IS OBSTACLE FOR FORENSIC LABS

<P>
The county is in final negotiations with a private developer to lease two 
proposed eight-story buildings in Santa Ana that would house forensic 
laboratories for the Sheriff's Department and new offices for the Environmental 
Management Agency. The county is negotiating with Hutton Development Co. Inc. 
on the lease. Hutton, which would own the structures, was chosen by the County 
Board of Supervisors last summer to build the two triangular-shaped buildings 
and a parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $27.9-million project has been named the Hutton Civic Centre Plaza 
and would be on a 3.4-acre vacant lot between Santa Ana Boulevard and 3rd 
Street, across from Sheriff's Department headquarters. Drawings call for the 
two buildings to be divided by a diagonal open courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
But because office uses are not allowed at the site, the Santa Ana Planning 
Commission and the City Council must approve zoning amendments before work can 
begin. City planners will review the amendments Monday. Construction is 
scheduled to begin in November and be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The project has been touted as an annex to the county's Civic Center, said 
Santa Ana Planning Commissioner Don Sizemore. 
</P>
<P>
But Sizemore said he is concerned that the proposal is inconsistent with the 
rest of the area. "Those buildings are going to be next door to single-family 
homes and lower-scale condominiums. It's going to be a high-density project 
that just doesn't seem consistent with what Santa Ana wants for that area any 
more," Sizemore said. 
</P>
<P>
Sizemore also expressed concern that the sheriff's building would be used as a 
holding facility for prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Richard Lay said the county does not plan to use the building 
as a holding facility, adding that a deed restriction will prohibit it. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton Development is best known for the 46-acre Hutton Centre business complex 
at MacArthur Boulevard and the Costa Mesa Freeway. The Civic Center area 
buildings were designed by Albert C. Martin Associates, an Irvine-based 
architecture firm, which designed the city hall building for Los Angeles. All 
of the sheriff's forensic facilities, including the county's new genetic 
testing laboratory, would be at the new site. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the sheriff's four forensic facilities -- the identification bureau 
and the crime, toxicology and DNA laboratories -- are spread out in different 
buildings in the Civic Center, said Frank Fitzpatrick, director of the 
sheriff-coroner's forensic sciences services. 
</P>
<P>
The different locations have been inconvenient for employees, particularly if a 
case requires several tests, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Hutton Civic Centre 
</P>
<P>
The Hutton Development Co. plans to build two eight-story buildings that would 
be separated by a courtyard. An eight-level parking lot would be built next to 
the center. The Environmental Management Agency would occupy Building 1, which 
would face Third Street, and the sheriff's forensic center would occupy 
Building 2, which faces Santa Ana Boulevard.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER MEDFLY PROPOSAL

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight will take up a proposed resolution asking the state to 
consider methods other than aerial pesticide spraying to eradicate the 
Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the resolution stops short of asking the state to stop spraying 
the area with malathion, as several other Orange County cities in the fruit fly 
spraying zone have done. 
</P>
<P>
Council members considered the resolution at a meeting earlier this month, but 
action on it was postponed because they wanted more time to review it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Don Bankhead suggested that the resolution be changed to take a 
stronger stand against aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the state has proven to us beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that 
(malathion) is not hazardous to our health, the spraying should be postponed," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard C. Ackerman said he supports the aerial spraying and would 
vote against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton resident Randall Toler, chairman of a local political organization 
called the Green Party, asked the council in January to adopt a resolution 
opposing the spraying.TOM McQUEENEY

CITY ADDS FUNDS TO ITS WAR ON GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The writing on the wall is becoming clearer here. And gaudier. And more 
expensive to remove. 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti, from hastily scrawled slogans to territorial markings, is appearing 
increasingly throughout the city and costing more to remove, according to 
Geoffrey H. Cobbett, maintenance services superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
The city also began using a professional service for graffiti removal last year 
but the amount of work to be done was simply underestimated, Cobbett said. 
Therefore, the City Council recently voted to supplement the current budget of 
$15,000 for graffiti removal with an additional $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"There's much more that needs to be done than we thought," said Cobbett. "We 
assumed that once the program was started, graffiti would be on a decline, but 
as soon as we take it off, they put it on again." 
</P>
<P>
Before hiring Graffiti Removal Inc. of Los Angeles, the city relied on 
volunteer groups and an in-house program to remove graffiti, Cobbett said. 
Paint also was available to anyone who wanted to clean up their own property. 
</P>
<P>
"We never really had a good program," Cobbett said. "We saw this program 
(Graffiti Removal Inc.) working in other cities and decided to go that route." 
</P>
<P>
A list of areas to be repainted is compiled weekly by the city staff, residents 
and the removal company, which has workers in the city about every two weeks. 
Profane graffiti, however, is usually removed within 48 hours, Cobbett said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Maria Moreno, while supporting the additional funding, suggested 
using youths for a graffiti removal summer program, as had been done before, 
rather than continuing to increase funds. 
</P>
<P>
But until a way can be found to take it off and keep it off, the city must 
continue to paint over it, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep after it," Cobbett added. "Maybe if we keep it up, people will get 
tired of redoing it."JULIE ESPY

COUNCIL TO HEAR FRAT APPEAL ON EXPULSION

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Cal State Fullerton fraternities, threatened with expulsion from their 
houses on fraternity row, plan a final appeal to the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge in August declared Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Pi 
public nuisances and ordered them to get city permits or close. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Commission unanimously rejected their requests for permits in 
January, leaving an appeal to the council as the last resort. The commission 
said the fraternities have a history of raucous parties and shouldn't be 
allowed in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
If the council rejects the appeals at the 7:30 p.m. meeting, the fraternities 
will be forced to abandon their houses across the street from each other on 
Teri Place, north of the campus. The council also will consider asking Cal 
State Fullerton to ban the fraternities as campus organizations.TOM McQUEENEY

About 90 Police Explorers graduated Monday from the Orange County Law 
Enforcement Explorer Academy held at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The four-day program, held twice each year and staffed with volunteers, is for 
male and female Explorers ranging from 14 to 20 years in age who want a career 
in law enforcement or related fields, said Janie Walker, academy director and 
police reserve officer for the Costa Mesa Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to instill pride, leadership and confidence in these young adults," she 
said. "We try to make it as close to a real police academy with all the stress 
and a lot of push-ups. We all get about five hours of sleep a night." 
</P>
<P>
Walker said almost all Orange County police departments act as posts for the 
Explorer program, which is chartered through the Boy Scouts of America. 
Volunteers from the departments donate their time to staff the academy and 
teach 10 classes including criminal law, military drill, radio communications 
and canine patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"We also do a lot of competitive things between platoons," Walker said. "The 
Explorers are constantly competing for spirit and teamwork. This kind of 
competition is a natural kind of thing between people of this age group." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the program, trophies are awarded for performance in the areas of 
physical agility, spirit, notebook quality, marching and final examination. A 
graduation is held for students, parents and police department dignitaries.

GOVERNOR REVIVES FAILED PLAN TO HELP FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: DEUKMEJIAN, AFTER REDISCOVERING A LARGELY UNSPENT $200 MILLION, 
PROPOSED TO USE IT AS PART OF A $2-BILLION, HOUSING-OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. 
</P>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ambitious $200-million program approved by voters eight years ago to help 
first-time home buyers break into the housing market proved to be a failure and 
vanished from view, its money unspent and its promise unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the message from voters was clear: Nearly 4 million of them agreed to a 
1982 bond measure that would establish the Cal-First Home Buyers program and 
help a new generation of Californians break into the increasingly expensive 
housing market. 
</P>
<P>
But the program, which was administered by the California Housing Finance 
Agency, was abandoned as unworkable with only $10 million in bonds outstanding 
and just 945 loans approved. 
</P>
<P>
And no one tried to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
Not the Legislature that had put the bond measure on the ballot. Not George 
Deukmejian, who as the Republican candidate for governor in 1982 had 
enthusiastically endorsed it. Not the state agency that was empowered to 
administer the program. Not the California Assn. of Realtors, which had 
sponsored the measure. 
</P>
<P>
That changed earlier this year, when the governor rediscovered the largely 
unspent $200 million and proposed to use it as part of a $2-billion housing 
opportunity program "to help put the dream of home ownership back within the 
reach of many Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's effort to resurrect the bond sales -- eight years after they won 
approval and six years after the program proved a flop -- has generated sharp 
criticism from Democratic legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"If the money was available, why wasn't it utilized?" asked Assemblyman Dan 
Hauser (D-Arcata), chairman of the Assembly Housing and Community Development 
Committee. "Or if there was a problem, why wasn't it brought to the 
Legislature's attention?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), chairman of the Senate Housing and Urban 
Affairs Committee: "The money hardly helped anybody. And what would it buy 
today as opposed to its purchasing power eight years ago? . . . $200 million 
eight years ago will buy only $100 million in today's market." 
</P>
<P>
Karney Hodge, whom Deukmejian appointed to head the California Housing Finance 
Agency, defended the Administration's record. "That wasn't our program to 
really even tinker with," Hodge said. "It's not the agency's program. It's the 
Legislature's program." 
</P>
<P>
The governor, Hodge said, has been considering programs to help first-time home 
buyers for several years, but Deukmejian "has had a full plate. He can't do 
everything at one time. He must sensibly prioritize the issues he's addressing, 
and this was the year for housing." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the housing finance agency's board of directors, Glendale real 
estate investor Sebastiano Sterpa, conceded that the $200-million program 
approved by the voters probably should have been revived sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"Some leadership should have been exercised that really could have done that," 
he said. The first program's failure, he said, produced "a natural reluctance 
to go to the voters" with another. 
</P>
<P>
Sterpa, as president of the California Assn. of Realtors, came up with the idea 
of a state-backed program to help first-time buyers in a period of rising 
housing prices and extraordinarily high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Under Sterpa's direction, the real estate association developed a plan for a 
state-sponsored loan program that could help energize a sluggish real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The bond money would be used to give buyers a break on interest rates in the 
first five years of their mortgages. Monthly payments would gradually rise 
until the home buyer was paying the full market rate interest plus an 
additional monthly amount to pay back the housing finance agency for the 
earlier interest reduction. 
</P>
<P>
It was the state's version of "creative financing" -- a scheme that allowed 
borrowers to find the money they needed and start out with reasonable monthly 
payments at a time when interest rates were as high as 16%. 
</P>
<P>
Critics were quick to point out that the financing was such that after five 
years, first-time buyers would owe more on their mortgages than when they took 
out the loans. The home buyers also would have to make monthly payments that 
were substantially higher than when they entered the program. That was fine as 
long as inflation continued to fuel sharp increases in income, but a disaster 
if anticipated wage increases did not materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one major problem," said Joel S. Singer, an economist who helped 
design the program for the California Assn. of Realtors and is now the group's 
executive vice president. "Everybody had to pay back all the benefits." 
</P>
<P>
And by the time the program was put into place, interest rates on conventional 
home mortgages had fallen off so sharply that eligible buyers could get loans 
on their own. And, Singer said, neither borrowers nor lenders were enthusiastic 
about a state program that few understood and that was complicated to 
administer. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian came up with a new proposal in his annual state of the state address 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his plan to implement his $2-billion proposal, the governor will 
seek legislative approval to ask the voters for reauthorization of the $200 
million first approved in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The new program represents a departure from earlier mortgage programs run by 
the agency because it raises the eligibility standards to include home buyers 
with incomes as high as $70,000 in some high-income parts of the state -- like 
Orange and Santa Cruz counties. In the past, no one with an income higher than 
$44,900 could qualify. And eligible borrowers could use the money under the new 
program to purchase houses costing as much as $239,100 in high-price areas like 
San Francisco, Marin and San Mateo counties. (In Los Angeles, the income limit 
would be $57,800 and the top sales price $188,100.) 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers like Hauser and Greene are complaining that the governor's program 
would shift the state's emphasis away from helping the neediest in the state to 
helping the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
"Helping somebody with an income at 150% of the median, people whose income is 
$50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 (a year) . . . that is deplorable," Greene said. 
"We have street people, people on welfare, people on the poverty line. . . . 
True middle-income people do not need help, not like those at the bottom of the 
economic ladder. They aren't helpless. It is outrageous to spend money in this 
fashion."

<P>
A year ago, the shots fell. Everything that could go Cal State Fullerton's way, 
seemed to. 
</P>
<P>
This season, it's been a different story. 
</P>
<P>
The team that beat Cal State Long Beach in overtime last year lost to the 49ers 
in overtime this year, falling, 70-69, in overtime Monday night at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans got one final chance, thanks to Wayne Williams' steal with 42 
seconds left. But the Titans' final shot, Van Anderson's leaning jumper in the 
lane, missed the mark with less than five seconds left. David Moody tipped the 
rebound, but Long Beach recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dipped Fullerton's record below .500 to 12-13. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we just prepare for Irvine," Titan Coach John Sneed said. The Titans meet 
the Anteaters on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was trying to break a four-game losing streak and Long Beach was 
trying to get its 16th victory, three more than the 49ers had all last season 
when they went 13-15. They were also trying to avenge an 11-point loss to the 
Titans earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers were the ones who got what they were after. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, with the help of two three-point baskets by Lucious Harris, had the 
ball and a one-point lead with less than a minute to play. But Williams stole 
the ball from Tyrone Mitchell, giving Fullerton one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
With three seconds left in regulation, Long Beach had the ball with the score 
tied, 62-62, but Harris lost the ball on the inbounds pass, colliding with 
Dareck Crane, and Fullerton took possession with one second left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton inbounded the ball to Mark Hill, who threw it from 60 feet, but the 
shot was way short, forcing the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had trailed by two, 62-60, but had the ball with 35 seconds left. 
Cedric Ceballos drove the lane with 18 seconds left, but couldn't make the shot 
fall. Williams got the rebound and, with 11 seconds remaining, he hit a 
leaning, 10-foot baseline jumper, tying the score, 62-62. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach was never able to pull ahead by more than four points in the first 
half, but started the second half by turning a one-point lead into a five-point 
advantage on back-to-back baskets by Mitchell. Mitchell might have given Long 
Beach a six-point lead had he not missed the free throw on a three-point 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
But as they had all evening, the Titans kept coming back. 
</P>
<P>
They fell behind by six, but then Williams, who was unsuccessful on his first 
six three-point shots, knocked one in to cut the lead to three. 
</P>
<P>
Later, down by three, Ceballos broke for a dunk, turning a three-point lead to 
one. And once more, down by four, Williams hit a three-point basket to cut the 
lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Hill, the shooting guard, has played well at times this season. But 
of late he has struggled, so much so that he scored a career-low three points 
against UC Santa Barbara Thursday. Once averaging more than 20 points a game, 
Hill has averaged only 13.5 in the past four. 
</P>
<P>
But he came out shooting well Monday, making six of seven shots in the first 
half, including three of four three-pointers. By halftime, he had 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
That was a good thing for the Titans. Without him, Fullerton was three of 16 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, closely guarded by the 49ers, attempted only three shots in the first 
half and had five points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Hill's shooting, Long Beach threatened to pull ahead late in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Harvey dunked off a spectacular save by Troy Joseph with about seven 
minutes left in the half, tying the score, 22-22, and starting a run in which 
he would score eight of Long Beach's next 10 points and staking the 49ers to a 
four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell added a basket, driving the lane for a layup. Then Mitchell made a 
steal and passed ahead to Harvey, who gave Long Beach a 26-22 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton cut the lead to two again on two free throws by Ceballos. But then 
Long Beach found Harvey open behind the Titans' zone and lobbed the ball to 
him. Fouled by Anderson, he made both free throws for a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Moody, Fullerton's center, responded off a lob with dunk of his own, making 
the lead two again. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach pulled ahead by four once more in the half, on Harris' three-pointer 
with about a minute left. But again, Fullerton didn't allow the 49ers to 
stretch the lead or even hold it. 
</P>
<P>
With three seconds left in the half, Hill hit a three-pointer to cut Long 
Beach's lead to 33-32 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Harris led Long Beach with 18 points and Rudy Harvey added 16. 
</P>
<P>
Hill had 22 points and Ceballos had 18 for Fullerton.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES: GONDRINGER DOESN'T GIVE UP AFTER TRAGEDY

<P>
No one would have blamed Donna Gondringer for quitting Golden West College's 
women's basketball team this season. 
</P>
<P>
She certainly had good reason, considering the tragedy she witnessed in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
It started when Gondringer and her best friend, Krisden Yoshiko Tanabe, 
returned to Gondringer's house in Westminster about 4:30 p.m. Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gondringer entered the house as Tanabe went to talk to her former boyfriend, 
Thomas Deshields White, who was waiting outside in a parked car. White shot and 
killed Tanabe with a shotgun, then, as Gondringer came out of the house and 
pleaded with him not to, shot and killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Tanabe and Gondringer would have been teammates this season at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
But Gondringer never thought of quitting the basketball team after the 
incident, that's not her style. She confronts things head-on, with an 
impressive amount of self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way I would have quit," Gondringer said. "Krisden wanted it 
(basketball success) just was much as I did. We always talked about it . . . I 
still cry myself to sleep some nights, but I have to get used to this. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is my life. You should see my room. There is a basket, and pictures 
of Michael Jordan and James Worthy . . . I like Magic Johnson too. He wears my 
number (32). So does Michael Jordan (23), he just wears it backward." 
</P>
<P>
Gondringer and her teammates have been outstanding all season. A 6-foot-1 
forward, Gondringer is averaging 15.6 points and 7.7 rebounds a game for Golden 
West, the top-ranked team in the state. She averaged 19.3 points and nine 
rebounds a game during Orange Empire Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
The Rustlers, who have a 32-1 overall record and won the conference title with 
a 12-0 mark, play host to Antelope Valley at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in the 
Southern California regional playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"All we've done this season makes me feel good," Gondringer said. "I know she's 
up there watching and hoping we do well." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gondringer's statistics are impressive, they could be better if she 
played more. Since Golden West is outscoring opponents by 31 points a game this 
season, the starters seldom play more than a few minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could play more," Gondringer said. "But this way everyone gets to 
play and (everyone) is ready in case something happens." 
</P>
<P>
Gondringer came to Golden West last season after an outstanding prep career at 
La Quinta High School. She twice was the Garden Grove League player of the 
year, first as a sophomore in 1985-86, then again as a senior in 1987-88. She 
never got a chance to win the award as a junior because a knee injury cut her 
season short. 
</P>
<P>
Gondringer, who averaged 19 points and 12 rebounds in her high school career, 
was recruited by some four-year colleges but had to attend community college 
because she didn't take enough core classes. 
</P>
<P>
But her first season at Golden West didn't go as well as she or the coaches had 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't do as well as she thought she would," Coach Dick Stricklin said. 
"She really only had one move in high school and because she was better than 
most players, she didn't have to develop any other moves. 
</P>
<P>
"For two seasons, we've worked with her to do some different things and she's 
really starting to come around this season." 
</P>
<P>
Gondringer has been contacted by several schools, including UCLA, Oklahoma, 
Hawaii, Fresno State and Oklahoma. She plans to attend a four-year college next 
season, but a more immediate goal is to win a state title. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West has been to the state tournament the last three seasons, twice as 
the top-ranked team from Southern California, but the Rustlers failed to get 
past the semifinal round each time. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gondringer is confident Golden West, which needs two regional 
victories to reach this season's tournament, March 1-3 at College of the 
Sequoias, can do better this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we can get there," she said of the championship game. "This team wants 
it more than last season. We are more dedicated and I can feel it from within."

ACCORD LEADS PACK IN O.C. AS FAVORITE '89 CAR

Orange County car buyers went along with the rest of the nation in 1989 in 
making the Honda Accord the most popular new car of the year, according to a 
study of new car registrations. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's Taurus, the nation's second-most popular car model last year, finished 
fifth in Orange County -- well behind the combined sales of the four leading 
models, all Japanese imports. 
</P>
<P>
But Ford's complete line boosted the car maker into first place as the most 
popular nameplate in the county. 
</P>
<P>
And among the 15 leading brands of cars sold in the county last year, only Ford 
Motor Co.'s Ford and Lincoln-Mercury divisions, General Motors' Cadillac 
division and Japan's Nissan Motor Co. posted registration increases. 
</P>
<P>
The registration data, compiled by R.L. Polk &amp; Co. of Detroit for the 
Orange County Motor Car Dealers Assn., covered new automobiles registered in 
the county from January through November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
No Chrysler Corp. products are among the top 15 passenger car nameplates, and 
the only European cars to make the list were Mercedes-Benz, in 11th place, and 
BMW, in 15th place. Both had declining local registrations. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Asian car makers, Toyota and Honda remained flat, while Mazda, Acura 
and Hyundai registrations dropped, the study shows. 
</P>
<P>
The 53,490 import car registrations among the county's top 15 car makes were 
off 4.25% from the first 11 months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And imports captured just 48% of county sales last year, down from 59% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts said the sharp decline doesn't signal a turning point in 
county car buyers' longstanding love affair with imports. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say that imports really are doing worse because sales were down 
everywhere, for everybody," said George Peterson, president of Auto Pacific 
Group in Santa Ana and a specialist in automotive brand marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said "1989 was a year in which any maker that held its own was doing a 
fantastic job and any growth was just that much better." 
</P>
<P>
Ford's performance, locally and nationally, cemented its position as the top 
domestic car maker, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford passenger car registrations were up 5% in Orange County, according to the 
Polk study. And while Ford passenger car sales were down nearly 6% nationally 
in 1989, according to Automotive News, an industry trade journal, Chevrolet 
sales were off nearly 9%. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Ford toppled Toyota to take first place overall in passenger 
car registrations, with a total of 15,671 in the first 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota finished second with 13,760 registrations and Honda was third at 12,222 
registrations. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top five passenger car nameplates were Nissan, with 9,136 
registrations, and Chevrolet, 7,679 registrations. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, the South Korean auto importer, fell farthest in the county rankings 
after three years of phenomenal growth. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the introduction in 1989 of the mid-size Sonata to augment the 
subcompact Excel introduced in 1986, Hyundai dropped from sixth place to ninth 
with 3,837 registrations, down 32% from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai Excel, the third most popular model in the county in 1988, dropped 
to ninth place on that list last year, down 49% from 1988, when it was 
Hyundai's only model. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai sales plunged in part because of quality control problems and because 
it lost its place as the low-price leader among import models. But the company 
also lost some of the momentum it built during the past two years by failing to 
introduce new models and to redesign the Excel in time to keep consumers from 
becoming bored with its offerings. 
</P>
<P>
To try to reignite consumer interest, Hyundai is about to introduce a two-door 
sports coupe, the Scoupe, and next year will add a fourth model to its line, a 
car that will be positioned "between the Excel and the Sonata," a spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Honda Accord, the popular Japanese import that last year became the first 
foreign car to top the national best-selling list -- retained number-one 
standing in Orange County for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota's Corolla line, including the Tercel, was the second most popular car 
model in the county, followed by the Toyota Camry and the Acura -- Honda's 
luxury car. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford Taurus -- the second most popular car model in the United States last 
year -- was fifth in registrations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Ford -- the namesake division of Ford Motor Co. -- was the only domestic auto 
brand in the top 10 of individual model registrations in the county last year. 
In addition to the Taurus, Ford's Escort placed eighth and the Thunderbird 
placed 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln-Mercury division of Ford Motor was the sixth most popular line 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic makers also did well in truck sales in Orange County. Ford was the 
most popular with 14,270 registrations, up 7%, followed by Chevrolet, up 17% at 
11,124, and Chrysler Corp., flat at 11,100. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota was fourth with 9,395 registrations, down 1%; Mazda was sixth with 
2,436, up 33% on the strength of its popular mini-van, and Nissan finished 
sixth with 2,426 registrations, a drop of 9%. 
</P>
<P>
In individual models, Toyota pickups ranked first with 7,531, a 7% decline from 
1988. The Plymouth Voyager/Dodge Caravan mini-van was second most popular with 
4,314 registrations, down 3%. Chevrolet's C-series trucks finished third with a 
28% registration increase to 4,270 units, followed by Jeep, up 14% at 3,879, 
and the Ford Aerostar, up 32% at 3,596 registrations.

FBI'S BOMBING PROBE CREATES A 'FOLK HERO' 
</P>

ENTERPRISE, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the cavernous, tin-sided warehouse, customers are once again idly browsing 
through the statues of Jesus, painted urns, clothes, dishes and other assorted 
surplus items for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, the owner, oversees the scene, relieved that life is 
once again so simple. A month ago FBI agents by the score descended on this 
little south Alabama town, seizing material from the warehouse, digging up 
O'Ferrell's yard at home and even exploring his septic tanks. 
</P>
<P>
They questioned O'Ferrell, 46, time and time again. They asked about an old 
manual typewriter he used to write a complaint letter to a federal court, which 
apparently was the same machine someone used to write a letter claiming 
responsibility for mailing the package bombs that killed an Alabama federal 
judge and a Georgia lawyer in December. Samples of hair, blood and saliva were 
taken from him and family members. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters arrived, and so did worldwide publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Time and time again, O'Ferrell denied any involvement. For two days he said it 
to the FBI, without even hiring a lawyer, and to the hordes of cameramen and 
reporters out on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"There ain't no words to describe what it's been like," O'Ferrell told a 
visitor the other day. "Some things you just can't describe, and that's one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI never found the typewriter, at least as far as anyone knows, and now 
the investigation into the Southern mail bombings is focusing on other people, 
other places. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, federal officials have searched the home of Walter Moody in Rex, Ga., 
and, in Ford City, Pa., authorities stopped a car driven by a Georgia man, Dean 
Hileman, and found seven homemade bombs, along with other illegal weapons. 
Neither man has been charged in connection with the bombings, however. 
</P>
<P>
Back here, O'Ferrell's reputation is in a kind of limbo. Never really 
identified as a suspect in the crimes, he now suffers from not being able to 
completely clear his name, although there's not much doubt among folks in 
Enterprise that the FBI misfired when it zeroed in on him. 
</P>
<P>
A new country song ("A Tribute to Robert Wayne O'Ferrell") sums up the 
sentiment: "With blond hair, a sweet smile and warm ways that I see,/He looks 
more like an angel than a bomber to me." 
</P>
<P>
From his command post in the center of the warehouse, O'Ferrell often talks 
passionately about his love of God, his fear of having his family attacked, his 
innocence, his lack of malice, his desire for an FBI apology. 
</P>
<P>
He also sells the tapes of his song for $10 apiece. Then there's the 
autographed T-shirt, design and price to come. And the movie offer, and the 
book offer. Television producers continue to telephone. If times aren't good, 
they sure are better. 
</P>
<P>
"They always say if God shuts one door, he'll open another," O'Ferrell said. 
Slipping a tape of his song into a tape player, he added: "Maybe this is His 
way of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of 1,000 cassette tapes arrived by Greyhound on Friday, and 
O'Ferrell said he expects them to sell quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many others in town are sorry to see the hoopla end. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the heavy federal presence put a dent in local crime. Now, bucks 
brought in by the media blitz are down to a trickle. But it was good while it 
lasted. And if O'Ferrell again becomes a hot subject of the investigation, 
well, the good times will be back. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens, Mayor Jacquelyn Thompson, in an interview, likened the 
episode to the town's history of overcoming adversity. Fears that the 
investigation might damage the city's image were unfounded: Local people 
"enjoyed the opportunity" to meet the temporary residents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Enterprise have a knack for turning a bad situation into a positive 
situation," the mayor declared. "That's the story of the boll weevil." 
</P>
<P>
The boll weevil? Yes, the Enterprise Chamber of Commerce boasts of being the 
home of the Boll Weevil Monument, which straddles Main Street downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only memorial in the world that glorifies a pest," chamber 
literature brags, noting that when the bug devastated the area's cotton crop in 
1915 and 1916, it forced farmers to diversify crops, enriching the area. The 
monument, the figure of a woman holding the boll weevil over her head, was 
erected in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
O'Ferrell's continuing enterprise is, to be sure, a good metaphor for the 
city's reputed knack for taking lemons and turning them into lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
Customers, he said, are itching for him to design a T-shirt, which he plans to 
do soon, although he has not decided how much he will sell them for. (One local 
business already has produced T-shirts celebrating the FBI's probe of septic 
tanks, but many who buy them want O'Ferrell to autograph them. So, reasons 
O'Ferrell, why not sell his own?) 
</P>
<P>
And the song, a country ballad written by Nanci Lee Fox of Hiawassee, Ga., can 
only enhance O'Ferrell's celebrity status, not to mention his pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
In case anyone accuses him of cashing in unfairly on the situation, O'Ferrell 
said that "we've all agreed that the top 10% of it (profit from the song sales) 
goes to God." 
</P>
<P>
O'Ferrell, who says he is a licensed Southern Baptist minister, talks a lot 
about God. At one point he said God prevented him from being angry at the FBI. 
He said that "in a way I wish I could have gotten bitter with them. I think I'd 
have felt better." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "I just don't like the way they done it," asserting that 
federal agents not only hassled him unjustifiably but also reneged on a promise 
to leave alone his relatives, including his mother, who is believed to have 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
O'Ferrell said agents told him "that they'd just follow me or whatever, until 
they find it (the typewriter). I said: 'Sir, you can follow me 20 years, you 
ain't going to find nothing.' 
</P>
<P>
"Within three hours after they got here," FBI agents must have "realized they 
had the wrong place," O'Ferrell said. "I've been told they just don't admit 
they're wrong." 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials and other law enforcement officials disagree that they treated 
O'Ferrell shabbily. Also, they assert that they never labeled him a "suspect," 
although news reports widely made that claim. Some news reports also cited 
sources claiming that O'Ferrell showed deception on a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
"We've interviewed him. That's all we're claiming," said Nestor Michnyak, an 
FBI spokesman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the investigation maintained that O'Ferrell did own the 
missing typewriter, "but we just can't prove it." O'Ferrell has acknowledged 
that he may have owned the old manual typewriter, but probably sold it. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprise Police Chief Tim Byrd said that investigators "afforded O'Ferrell 
all his constitutional rights. He was treated like any other citizen." 
</P>
<P>
Over at Dottie's Country Kitchen, Dottie Mitchell, the proprietress, told a 
visitor that the bad part of the episode is that, for now, it's over. Drawing 
on a cigarette, she said the reporters and feds are gone and "I'm sorry to see 
'em go, because my business was good." Puff, puff. "I hope somethin' else'll 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
At the Chamber of Commerce, where a big blue boll weevil doll greets visitors 
in the lobby, Sherilyn Britt, office manager, said many of the 400 businesses 
in the town of 21,000 people have profited from the influx of newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
And Chief Byrd said the FBI, with its massive technology and personnel, has 
helped his force fight crime. With federal assistance such as fingerprinting, 
he said, 14 burglaries have been solved, netting four suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI is still operating out of a building next to the Boll Weevil Inn. Once 
abuzz with activity, it was quiet last week. No one answered a knock at the 
door, which, like the windows, was covered. Two whip antennas remain atop the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
O'Ferrell complained that the investigation has "put us in a lot of danger," 
referring to his wife and two daughters. Gesturing toward the huge entrance to 
the building, he said: "How do I know that bomber ain't going to walk in that 
door right now and shoot me or go catch one of my kids and kidnap them or catch 
my wife off somewhere and kidnap or shoot her?" 
</P>
<P>
But O'Ferrell gleefully recites the encouragement he has received from around 
the country. Telephone calls, he said, have come from almost every state. A 
Fresno, Calif., man called to say he and others "believed in me," O'Ferrell 
recalled. "Said that they thought I was the coolest cat they'd ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Such stories irk some FBI agents, leading one to complain that O'Ferrell is 
becoming a "folk hero." Sneered the agent: "The big bad government didn't 
arrest him, and now we're bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
O'Ferrell thinks no one ought to begrudge his good fortune, " 'cause there's 
not enough money in the world to pay me for what they put me through in the 
last four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Edith Stanley, staff researcher in Atlanta, contributed to this story.

L.A. HOUSING BIAS SUIT SETTLED FOR $450,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PENELOPE McMILLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A $450,000 settlement described as the largest ever reached in a housing 
discrimination lawsuit in the United States was announced Monday in a case 
involving a black airline employee who was rejected as a tenant at a 
Westchester apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
The suit on behalf of Allan Lopez, now a 28-year-old customer service agent for 
USAir, and others was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court two years ago against 
Westchester Investment Co., owners of the 161-unit Belford Park Apartments, and 
its manager, Gutweiler-Woolley Properties Inc., after Lopez was told he could 
not share an apartment with a white tenant. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest individual housing discrimination settlement in history," 
said Patrick O. Patterson, western regional counsel for the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Education Fund, at a press 
conference announcing the settlement. "The amount shows apartment managers and 
owners that blatant racial discrimination is not only illegal but morally 
intolerable, and from now on it will also be extremely costly." 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the largest previous settlements in similar cases of racial 
discrimination had been $375,000 in the Long Island area of New York, Patterson 
said, and $327,000 in Washington, D.C. A 1982 case over a home purchase 
discrimination suit in the Chicago area was settled for $122,675, he added. 
</P>
<P>
No previous California case approached those amounts, according to Stephanie 
Knapik of the Westside Fair Housing Council. She said the largest until now had 
been a 1987 settlement of $80,000 in a tenant suit on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Marcella Brown of the Fair Housing Congress of Southern California said most 
cases in the region are settled for "under $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very satisfied," said Lopez, a native of Jamaica who left Los Angeles 
shortly after his experience in Westchester and now lives in Miami. "I'm not 
walking around with a chip on my shoulder anymore." 
</P>
<P>
John Klock, president of the Altadena-based Westchester Investment Co., refused 
to comment on the case or the settlement. Attempts to reach representatives of 
Gutweiler-Woolley Properties, which is no longer managing Belford Park, were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he had been living in the United States for seven years in October, 
1987, when he answered a notice placed by Robert Beaumont on the employee 
bulletin board at Pacific Southwest Airlines, where Lopez was working. The ad 
said Beaumont was looking for someone to share his two-bedroom, $705-a-month 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont, who is white, said Monday that after his previous roommate, who also 
was white, had moved out, he wanted to find someone else to share his rent. 
When Lopez contacted him, Beaumont said, "we got along really well" and decided 
he could move into the complex, which was 98% white. 
</P>
<P>
But when Lopez started to move in his belongings, the resident managers said he 
would have to fill out an application, although Beaumont's previous roommate 
had not been asked to do so. The managers then rejected Lopez's application and 
threatened to evict Beaumont if he allowed Lopez to stay. Beaumont said one 
manager used a racial epithet while declaring that blacks sometimes "rub me the 
wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet-mannered Lopez said he had lived in mixed neighborhoods in Culver 
City and the Wilshire area, but had not faced outright discrimination before 
this. "I'd heard of such confrontations," he said "but I'd never taken note of 
it until it hit me in the face." 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont said he found the Westside Fair Housing Council in the phone book and 
suggested that Lopez report it. Lopez agreed because, he said, "I had to do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
The council sent two white men and Robin Patrick, a black woman, to seek 
apartments at Belford Park. Patrick was told there were no vacancies but the 
two white men were told there were units available. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont, Patrick and the Westside Fair Housing Council joined Lopez as 
plaintiffs in the suit, filed in February, 1988. Attorneys from the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Education Fund, a 61-year-old advocacy group which has no current 
affiliation with the NAACP, represented them. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumont, a 31-year-old television effects coordinator, moved out of the 
complex. "It got real difficult, having to seek a roommate," he said, not 
knowing "how far did this extend? Was an Asian OK? Was an Indian person OK?" 
</P>
<P>
Lopez decided not to stay in the Los Angeles area. "I was kind of scared," he 
said. "It was in a lot of papers. I was afraid if I tried to rent an apartment, 
I wouldn't get one." He moved to San Diego, and later to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why this particular case may have received a larger award, Patterson said 
he believed one factor was the defense fund's involvement. "Most cases are 
handled by private practitioners," he said. "We're part of a nationwide 
organization, and these resources made it possible. In this case, we sued the 
company that owned the complex, the company that managed the complex and the 
two resident managers. As a result, we ended up litigating against four law 
firms. And, all these firms were funded by insurance companies paying the cost 
of defense. A sole practitioner facing something like this is likely to get 
buried. It's very complex, time-consuming litigation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a 1988 amendment to the Federal Fair Housing Act removed the 
$1,000 limit on punitive damages that could be collected. That ultimately might 
have affected the amount of an award, Patterson said, had the plaintiffs 
prevailed in a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
He added, "We had access to evidence that is often not available." In addition 
to management statements made to Beaumont, he said, a Los Angeles police 
officer living in the complex testified that the managers routinely used racial 
slurs and told him the owner had requested they keep black tenants out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the monetary settlement, the companies also agreed to a series 
of actions, such as training their employees in fair housing practices and 
advertising that they do not discriminate. Westchester Investment Co. further 
agreed that within three years, at least 25% of Belford Park's 161 apartments 
would be occupied by at least one black tenant.

DISNEY'S FLORIDA CRITICS WARN OF A GREEDY MONSTER

<P>
With the Walt Disney Co. talking about building a billion-dollar theme park in 
Southern California, Long Beach and Anaheim are competing for its attentions 
the way Cinderella's stepsisters went after the handsome prince. 
</P>
<P>
But a growing number of critics in Orlando, home of the world's largest Disney 
park, contend that the company behind the lovable mouse is a political power 
motivated by greed, bent on growth and nearly impossible to control.

Increasingly, Orlando and surrounding Orange County, Fla., are reeling under 
the weight of the stunning financial success Disney brought them. Local 
observers complain that as the corporation continues to expand, it turns its 
back on the gridlocked roads and housing crunch that have come with prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, critics say, Orlando would be nowhere without the Walt Disney Co., 
which pumped millions of dollars into the local economy and made a humid farm 
town the world's No. 1 commercial tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent months, the tide of public sentiment in Florida has begun to turn 
against Disney, now being referred to in some circles as "the mouse that ate 
Orlando" or "the grinch that stole affordable housing." Today, as Disney is 
pitting Long Beach and Anaheim against each other in a competition for a new 
theme park in Southern California, Floridians suggest that much could be 
learned from the Orlando experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim and Long Beach better look long and hard at Disney. Those people are 
powerful and dangerous around here," Orange County, Fla., Commissioner Bill 
Donegan said. "The roads are jammed, everything is clogged and now we have to 
raise taxes to pay for Disney's business. . . . It's just plain greed." 
</P>
<P>
"Disney has always been a good neighbor to Florida," Disney spokesman Charles 
Ridgway said. "The economic condition of the Orlando community is extremely 
good. I think the fears are somewhat unwarranted and the conclusions 
unsupportable." 
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Florida, some say, illustrates how even the most 
successful Disney enterprise can bring a community economic salvation and be a 
nagging thorn in the side. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get carried away with the pixie dust," cautioned Commissioner Linda 
Chapin. "I, like most everybody else in Orange County (Fla.), have a love-hate 
relationship with Disney." 
</P>
<P>
While some in Orlando are grumbling, the city of Anaheim -- where Disney has 
been king for 35 years -- describes its relationship with the company as "only 
positive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Anaheim officials are so pleased with Disneyland they have vowed to do 
"almost anything" to bring the second park to their town. And Long Beach 
business leaders, hungry for tourist dollars and a livelier image, are urging 
the city to "bend over backward" to woo Disney. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando officials point out that the Disney company that came to Anaheim in the 
1950s -- led by a man with a wild vision and a shoestring budget -- is today a 
powerful mega-corporation that literally runs its own government in central 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Disney went to Orlando in the mid-1960s when the town was a collection of 
orange groves and cattle herds. Anonymously, he bought a chunk of land the size 
of San Francisco to build his second dream park. 
</P>
<P>
Because he deplored the string of gaudy motels that had sprung up around 
Disneyland in Anaheim, Disney was determined to tightly control development 
around what would become Walt Disney World in Orange County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
So eager was the Florida state Legislature to accommodate Disney that it 
allowed the company to create a government 18 miles outside of Orlando with its 
own police department, fire department, taxation powers and building codes. 
</P>
<P>
It is known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District and surrounding Orange and 
Osceola counties are virtually powerless to control it. About 27 families 
reside there, all handpicked by the Walt Disney Co. Any housing built on Disney 
land is promptly de-annexed out of Reedy Creek's boundaries, ensuring that only 
the Disney employees chosen to live in Reedy Creek have the right to elect the 
governing Board of Supervisors. And all of the supervisors work for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't American," Donegan said. "They are a quasi-city not required to 
follow any growth management. They can build whatever they please on that 
property and there isn't a thing we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature's generosity stemmed in part from its hope that Disney would do 
for Orlando what it did for Anaheim. And Disney more than delivered. Orlando 
now has an expanding international airport, a convention center that is about 
to double in size and more hotel rooms than New York City, area tourist 
officials report. 
</P>
<P>
But now, 20 years later, Orange County, Fla., wants to manage its staggering 
growth while Disney is still itching to build. The corporation's unique powers 
give it the autonomy to move straight from design to construction, and the 
county struggling to harness growth "can't even send out a building inspector 
to make sure it's done right," Donegan said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's polished image began to tarnish around Orlando last summer when it 
agreed to pay the county nearly $14 million to help improve roads stressed to 
their limits, in large part because of Disney tourists. In exchange, the county 
agreed not to challenge Disney's government powers for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seemed happy with the deal until a few weeks later, when Disney called 
a press conference to announce its plan for the '90s: seven more hotels, 29 new 
attractions, 19,000 more employees and a fourth amusement park -- all of which 
promise to further burden roads and swell the ranks of low-wage earners 
searching for houses they can afford, several county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in a way it may have been dishonest," said Orange County Commissioner 
Hal Marston, an otherwise enthusiastic supporter of Disney developments. "We 
were bargaining in good faith . . . and this was an absolute surprise to Orange 
County. I didn't hear the plans from Disney, I heard them from reporters." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Disney's public image took another lashing, perhaps the worst yet, 
when $57 million in state tax-free bond money became available to local Florida 
governments on a first-come, first-served priority. Disney was first in line 
and took all of it to upgrade the amusement park's sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County had planned to use its share of the money to build low-income 
housing. When word got out that a corporation that made $703 million last year 
had snatched money that would have helped the poor, the public outcry could be 
heard all the way to Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
"How did such a smelly problem develop, especially one that pits families of 
modest means against a resort giant?" the Orlando Sentinel cried in a Jan. 9 
editorial demanding that Disney give the money back. "Unless Reedy Creek turns 
back the bonds, Disney will become the grinch that stole affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
Further miffing county officials is Disney's pattern of building attractions 
strikingly similar to Orlando's own tourist spots. Orlando had Wet 'n' Wild, 
and Disney built Typhoon Lagoon. Orlando had its popular Church Street Station 
night spot and Disney built a night spot called Pleasure Island. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is little evidence that Orlando's business has suffered, 
Disney's custom of selling four-day passes to the park has led some officials 
to suspect the company intends to devour all the tourist dollars, keeping 
visitors on Disney territory for their entire stay and throwing Orlando the 
scraps. 
</P>
<P>
"Their whole goal in life is to take the visitor to Disney World and never let 
them escape, which means we don't have the off-site economic benefit, but we do 
have the off-site traffic problems," Commissioner Chapin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Disney has this extraordinary mentality -- they absolutely have this mind-set 
that they are wonderful. They think we are ingrates, biting the hand that feeds 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Some would say Disney is right. After all, as many as 80% of the 12 million 
tourists who came to Orlando last year came for Disney, said Abraham Pizam, 
director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Even critics acknowledge that Disney pays $23 million in taxes yearly and, 
because it provides almost entirely for itself, it does not get back $23 
million in government services. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is riding on Disney's coattails -- hospitals, doctors' offices, gas 
stations, pharmacies, glass makers," Pizam said. "You may think that people 
here bow to the Old Mouse, but there is no doubt -- whether you like Disney or 
dislike Disney -- that this town exists in its present form because of Disney. 
Fifteen years ago, this was a cow town." 
</P>
<P>
Now more than ever, some county commissioners want to see Disney's political 
wings clipped, but they are bound by last summer's road agreement to stay mum 
for the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Some local leaders hope the Florida Legislature will move to undo what it did 
for Disney more than 20 years ago, but that seems unlikely. Disney remains 
enormously popular in the state, where a University of Central Florida survey 
concluded 18 months ago that locals endorse the tourist industry 3 to 1. And in 
Florida, tourism is synonymous with Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you could classify Disney as the strongest lobby in Tallahassee (the 
state capital)," Marston said. "A couple of weeks ago Disney invited every 
legislator in the state and their families to come to Disney World for the 
weekend -- all expenses paid. I don't know who took them up. I certainly 
wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever image-bashing Disney is taking in Florida, it hasn't mattered on the 
West Coast. Long Beach officials are engaging in closed-door talks with Disney 
and Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter, at the mere mention of a second park, responded: 
"Yes, yes, yes." 
</P>
<P>
Disney dropped its bombshell Jan. 12 when, after courting Long Beach with talk 
of a park for nearly a year, company Chairman Michael Eisner drew Anaheim into 
the fray, saying the new park would go to the city that "wants us more." The 
race, it seems, will be won by the city willing to spend the most on road and 
parking improvements. The price tag could approach $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders in both cities say they are sophisticated enough to avoid the Florida 
experience -- that their towns are all grown up, short on land and not about to 
bow to a talking mouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I call Disney a top-shelf organization. They are quality," Hunter said. "We're 
not a bunch of people that fell off the turnip truck here in Anaheim. Of course 
Eisner wants a little bidding war. We're not dumb. But we don't give away the 
store." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said of his city's valuable ocean acreage: "That is 
some of the primest land in the world, and there are many uses for it. Yes, 
Disney would be a key (to the city's success.) But if Disney decides not to 
come here, it is not the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the two cities are competing for a prize that is still an evolving 
idea. Disney spokesmen say millions of dollars have been spent exploring 
possibilities in both towns, but the "conceptual masterpiece" is unfinished. 
The company, traditionally secretive about its intentions, will not disclose 
what is being dreamed up by its team of "imagineers" working in a Glendale 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
The plans for Anaheim are extremely vague -- a theme park of some sort on 60 
acres around Disneyland. But tourist-related tax revenues already make up more 
than 20% of the city's general fund, which pays for such services as police and 
fire departments. And Anaheim officials say they know more of a good thing when 
they see it. 
</P>
<P>
"Disneyland is the most important tenant in our city," City Manager Bob Simpson 
said. "We'll do anything and everything we can to help them." 
</P>
<P>
Only a little more is known about Disney's plans for Long Beach: a water park 
on 256 acres of ocean around the Queen Mary that would open in 10 years and 
bring 10,000 new jobs. Sources who have glimpsed the sketches recall "petting 
dolphins and lots of sea horses" and a possible "Mysteries of the Deep" theme. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's presence looks awfully good to some officials in Long Beach, a city 
that has tried for 20 years to debunk the public perception that it's a 
worn-out Navy town of strip joints and dockside bars. When a 1989 survey asked 
travelers across the state to rank four California beach towns where they would 
most like to vacation, Long Beach finished last. 
</P>
<P>
"On a scale of 1 to 10 Disney is a 10. Nobody else is Disney. When you are 
talking Disney, you are talking Rolls-Royce," Long Beach City Councilman Les 
Robbins said. "I think if you took a (council) vote today, it would be nine-zip 
to pursue Disney and leave no rock unturned." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Mary Lou Fulton contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Now that Long Beach and Anaheim have made clear their interest in having a 
second Disney amusement park in Southern California, the next move belongs to 
Disney. "Imagineers" are busily working up theme park ideas. Once the details 
are in place, the cities must decide how much of the bill -- which could run as 
high as $100 million -- they are willing to foot for roads and parking 
facilities. Disney has said the city willing to spend the most will be the site 
of the billion-dollar attraction. Disney has refused to reveal so much as a 
time line for its plans. But Anaheim is already examining road improvements and 
Long Beach recently extended by six months the company's exclusive negotiating 
rights to valuable water acreage around the Queen Mary. Disney's deadline for 
presenting project details in Long Beach is next summer.

They started as status symbols of the rich and powerful, expensive high-tech 
telephones for those who longed to do business or chat with their friends while 
trapped on a crowded freeway. Now, some seven years after they hit the 
airwaves, cellular telephones are proving to be more than mere gadgets for 
those in the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
Far more. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, experts predict, wireless personal communication devices 
-- as cellular phones are now called -- will become commonplace and will give 
their owners portable, global communication capabilities reminiscent of Dick 
Tracy's, James Bond's -- even Maxwell Smart's. 
</P>
<P>
Much like Tracy, who wore a two-way radio phone on his wrist, and Smart, whose 
shoe converted to a telephone, many of us will soon be carrying phones on our 
belts, in our pockets and purses, even in notebook-size computers. 
</P>
<P>
And just as Bond often used hidden transmitters to trace his foes, we will be 
able to track phone-toting friends and business associates on an intelligent 
telephone network, a kind of super-duper call-forwarding system that can locate 
another one of these new-style phones almost anywhere in the civilized world. 
</P>
<P>
"What the personal computer brought to the masses in the 1980s is what personal 
communications is going to bring in the 1990s," says Steve Sazegari, a 
telecommunications analyst with Dataquest, a Silicon Valley 
technology-marketing research firm. "By the end of the decade, we are going to 
be able to get access to services, information and routine conversation 
regardless of our location." 
</P>
<P>
The social and business implications of this pending explosion are as 
far-ranging as those brought by the personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
Customers will be offered new levels of convenience and access, all translating 
into increased opportunities to converse with friends and business associates. 
Stuck in line at a theater? Call your mother and earn some good will. Waiting 
for a call? You won't need to stick by the phone; it will stick by you. 
</P>
<P>
The down side, however, is the very real possibility that this constant access 
will prove privacy invading, intrusive, an unwanted tether to home or office. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, businesses and entrepreneurs of every stripe are scrambling to 
take advantage of the money-making opportunities the new technologies and 
services will bring. Researchers estimate that telecommunications revenues, now 
running about $140 billion annually and growing nearly three times faster than 
the population, will further explode in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
Says Greg Sawers, who tracks the phone industry for the New York investment 
firm of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.: "Telecommunications will be the best 
business opportunity of the next decade, period." 
</P>
<P>
Early pieces of this scenario are already falling into place. 
</P>
<P>
In just the last six months, several key events have occurred. Motorola 
introduced a pocket-size cellular phone that weighs a mere 10 ounces. Motorola 
and International Business Machines announced plans for a radio network 
connecting specially equipped personal computers. McCaw Cellular 
Communications, the nation's largest cellular service, launched an ambitious 
wireless communication network that will give cellular customers, now tied to a 
specific region, access to the radio waves almost anywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, experts say, these and many more developments yet to 
come will be combined with existing cellular, paging and conventional telephone 
systems to allow communication by voice, facsimile or computer data stream with 
anyone, from virtually anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The need for coherent information instantaneously is becoming a strong 
societal demand," said Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive of Pacific 
Telesis, which provides local wired telephone service in California and is a 
growing player in cellular communications worldwide. "And this is especially 
true for people who are on the move." 
</P>
<P>
The keys to these emerging services are radio waves and a host of emerging 
technologies that can cram and track increasing numbers of conversations and 
other transmissions into these finite bands of sound. Cellular service, as it 
is now configured, is just the initial step. 
</P>
<P>
When the current generation of cellular service made its debut in Chicago in 
late 1983, just weeks before the break-up of American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph, few could have predicted the promising future ahead for portable 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the past woefully inadequate and overloaded mobile phone system 
offered few indications. Even AT&amp;T, whose own Bell Laboratories invented 
cellular technology in the late 1940s and refined it 15 years later, didn't see 
a ready market for its breakthrough creation. 
</P>
<P>
But by mid-1984, when service was begun in Los Angeles in time for the Summer 
Olympics, it quickly became obvious that portable communications was an idea 
whose time had come. Within six months of service inauguration in Los Angeles, 
the system had attracted about 15,000 subscribers, nearly twice initial 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, thanks largely to expanding service capacities and rapidly 
dropping equipment prices, the number of cellular subscribers has grown to more 
than 3 million in the United States and 4 million worldwide. Los Angeles, with 
nearly 260,000 subscribers, remains the largest market. 
</P>
<P>
But in markets such as Los Angeles, the limits of the currently available 
technology are being sorely tested. In some parts of the basin, particularly 
West Los Angeles and Santa Monica, the immense popularity of cellular service 
has led to overloaded circuits and temporary interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
All-digital networks provide an alternative. These networks, one to be 
introduced in Southern California within the next 18 to 24 months, will ease 
the congestion by more than quadrupling the system's capacity. Digital networks 
use simpler signals with less distortion than current systems, thus allowing 
more communication over the same radio frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, digital systems offer the foundation for a host of other 
technologies and services. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first to emerge is one dubbed CT-2, the second generation of the 
cordless telephone. This technology is being tested in England as a system of 
cordless, pay public telephones. People carry them in their pockets or purses 
and use them when in the vicinity of a relay station, which the English call a 
Telepoint. 
</P>
<P>
CT-2 technology has its limits. A relay station can serve a relatively small 
area; in England the system is set to accommodate a radius of about 1,000 feet. 
And calls cannot be transferred from one station to the next, as cellular calls 
are handed off to the next cell station. This means that callers must stay put. 
Further, for the time being, the British Telepoint system relays only outgoing 
calls from handsets. It does not accept incoming calls, so you can call someone 
but he can't call you back. 
</P>
<P>
Millicom Inc. has proposed to operate a similar system in New York City and is 
awaiting a decision from the Federal Communications Commission on whether to 
grant the company use of certain radio frequencies there. 
</P>
<P>
Although these systems are outdoor public networks, the same technology can be 
easily adapted to offices, and should prove especially useful in organizations 
where workers are frequently on the go or where they are regularly shifted from 
desk to desk. 
</P>
<P>
With indoor use of CT-2, relay stations could be set up throughout a company's 
office complex. Mobile workers and others without permanent desks could carry 
phones in their pockets or on their belts and use them as they would a cordless 
phone in the home. Desk phones at these companies would look just like regular 
office phones now, with one glaring difference: They would be cordless. So if 
you were forced to move, you would simply pick up your phone along with the 
rest of your belongings and set up elsewhere. No new wiring needed. 
</P>
<P>
This type of service should be available shortly. Earlier this month, General 
Cellular Corp., which serves some sections of the United States, unveiled a 
100-pound relay station that is the size of a suitcase and operates on regular 
electrical current. The San Francisco-based company said the device, priced at 
about $15,000, will be tested later this year in office complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Farther out on the horizon are what have been called personal communications 
networks -- wireless transmission systems pre-programmed with "intelligence" 
about the likely whereabouts of each subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a super-duper call-forwarding system, and it will ultimately do what an 
ultra-smart secretary already does: Find you and filter your calls," says 
Herschel Shosteck, a telecommunications market researcher in Silver Spring, Md. 
"Sure, it's a vision, but it's a vision of what the telecommunications world 
will begin to look like in just three to five years." 
</P>
<P>
The network is built on the premise that each customer has a personal telephone 
number that travels with him and rings him regardless of his whereabouts. This 
is a substantial departure from the fundamental limitations of present 
telephone networks, which tie a phone number to a location, such as home, 
office or car. 
</P>
<P>
Call-forwarding, which allows subscribers to program their phones to pass a 
call to another number, has eased somewhat the limitations of the current 
system. But the personal communications network goes even further because it 
treats an incoming phone call as a page for a specific individual, and then 
searches the likely hangouts -- home, office, car or wherever -- of that 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Further, experts predict, such a service may screen incoming calls according to 
who is calling. For example, if you didn't want to talk to your boss or spouse, 
you could instruct the network to filter out calls from their personal 
communications identification numbers. 
</P>
<P>
What will make such systems and services possible, analysts explain, are 
ever-increasing integration and connections among the various 
telecommunications operators and the expanding vision of conventional wire-line 
carriers such as AT&amp;T and the regional Bell operating companies. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T, which initially ignored cellular service as a meaningless 
communication sidelight, now says it is entering the business as fast and 
aggressively as it can. "We originally thought that it was an interesting 
little business, but that it was never going to be a big deal," said Richard B. 
Snyder, director of AT&amp;T's cellular system business unit. "We were dead 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Like other cellular providers, particularly the regional Bell companies such as 
Pacific Telesis and BellSouth, AT&amp;T is trying to win cellular franchises 
internationally, to become a greater part of the emerging worldwide networks 
that will link wired and wireless communication services. 
</P>
<P>
Already, McCaw Cellular, an aggressive service provider based near Seattle, is 
trying to offer the wireless domestic equivalent of AT&amp;T's vast wired 
network. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman and Chief Executive Craig McCaw says that his vision is to link 
McCaw's own cellular franchises with cellular affiliates in adjacent regions it 
does not serve directly. The result would be a network that allows a customer 
to use the same cellular telephone anywhere in the nation and, more 
importantly, to be accessible to others anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
As companies and providers scramble to take advantage of the emerging 
opportunities, turf battles are inevitable. But analysts argue that ultimately, 
there is room for a variety of telecommunication services, both wireless and 
over conventional telephone wires. 
</P>
<P>
"It's completely specious to look at these technologies as competing with each 
other," Shosteck said. "In the beginning there will be harsh words and 
political battles, but ultimately, we will see that the services enhance and 
feed off each other. 
</P>
<P>
"And the type of phone we will use will depend on where we are, and what we 
want to do."

STORM FAILS TO PUT DENT IN DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: SOUTHLAND STARTS TO WARM UP. THERE WAS ENOUGH SNOW TO CLOSE RESORT 
ROADS, BUT NOT ENOUGH RAIN TO REACH NORMAL LEVELS.

Southern California's rainy big chill eased Monday, but the brisk holiday 
weekend storm that dropped more than two inches of rain and up to six feet of 
snow in local mountains did little to bring an end to the state's lengthy 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
Chill winds kept the high temperature at Los Angeles Civic Center to 59 degrees 
Monday, 10 degrees below normal but markedly warmer than Sunday's rain-doused 
55 degrees. At WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times, 
meteorologist Bill Hibbert said conditions will grow gradually warmer and the 
routine coastal cloudiness will resume by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the storm dropped 2.51 inches of rain at Civic Center, bringing the 
season total to 5.43 inches -- below both last season's mark of 7.22 inches and 
the normal rainfall by this time of 10.21 inches.

<P>
"It's going to take several more of these to do any drought-breaking," Hibbert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The long-range forecast offers little optimism. A 60-day outlook by the 
National Weather Service predicted that rainfall would be marginally above 
normal on the West Coast. But Southern California, sitting at the lower edge of 
the "above normal" band, is less likely than the north to get that rain, 
Hibbert said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next five days, temperatures are likely to return to the 60s during the 
day, but the nights will remain chilly, the meteorologist said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm dumped up to six feet of snow on local ski resorts just in time for 
the holiday weekend, but it proved to be too much snow. Highways were closed to 
all but residents; would-be skiers and the resorts hoping for their business 
were forced apart by snow-clogged roads. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it was not much of anything," said Margaret Krajewski of the 
Snow Valley ski resort. Snow Valley, as well as other major sites, were forced 
to shut down Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very hopeful that it will be open tomorrow," she said. "Another big 
weekend and here we are." 
</P>
<P>
Krajewski said the three-day storm dumped almost double the amount of snow seen 
during most substantial storms. 
</P>
<P>
The storm's impact on other local roadways eased Monday, just in time for those 
vacationers who made it to their holiday destinations to start the long drive 
home. 
</P>
<P>
A 40-mile stretch of Interstate 5, from Castaic to Kern County's Wheeler Ridge, 
reopened at 8 a.m. Monday, after being closed for 14 hours because of ice and 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
The closure came after a snowstorm degenerated into "whiteout" conditions, 
cutting visibility to as little as 50 feet, said California Highway Patrol Sgt. 
Scott Jones of Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
During the closure, the CHP escorted caravans of 200 to 300 cars over the 
freeway about once an hour. Some drivers had to wait two hours before a CHP 
patrol scouting the roads declared that it was safe enough for a caravan to 
travel through, the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks were banned from the road "because they have a tendency to get stuck the 
fastest," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 cars and trucks were stuck on I-5 before the CHP closed the roadway 
Sunday evening, and they remained stranded for three hours until state highway 
workers sanded the roads, Jones said. Two trucks jackknifed and some vehicles 
slipped backward on ice-covered roads before the closure, but no injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
In Northern California, temperatures were still frigid and, in Reno, officials 
were still battling to dig out from the second-strongest storm recorded this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland reported a record low of 39 degrees Monday, five degrees below the 
figure set in 1983. Nearby Alameda also recorded a 39, tying a 41-year low. 
</P>
<P>
In Reno, however, residents awoke to a shivering 6 below zero -- which 
obliterated the previous mark of 7 above zero that was set in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
The storm that coursed across Northern California and Nevada dumped 21 inches 
of snow on the city's streets -- slightly less than a monster storm that dumped 
more than 22 inches of snow on Reno in 1916 -- and more than six feet elsewhere 
in the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Interstate 80 was open at midday, a day after a mudslide blocked the 
main artery between Sacramento and the Nevada ski resorts. The slide sent mud 
over all four lanes at depths up to 12 feet in places, and forced the closure 
of a 77-mile stretch of road. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound lanes had reopened Sunday night, and one westbound lane was 
cleared for traffic at 2 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Hal Schilling said city workers and local construction crews 
brought in to aid the workers continued to shovel around the clock to make 
streets passable. 
</P>
<P>
The southern branch of the storm which left Southern California Sunday night 
dumped snow on Arizona as it made its way east. Up to two feet of snow was 
reported in southern mountains overnight, and the Arizona Department of Public 
Safety was forced to close a 200-mile stretch of Interstate 40 across the 
middle of the state because of heavy snow.

LAWYER SAYS SILBERMAN SWALLOWED PILLS

Richard T. Silberman lost consciousness in a hotel room here last weekend after 
swallowing an unknown number of prescription sleeping pills, his lawyer said 
Monday, just hours before the San Diego businessman and defendant in an 
upcoming money-laundering trial was released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, James Brosnahan, identified the pills as Halcion 2, a commonly 
prescribed sleeping medication. Asked how many pills Silberman ingested, 
Brosnahan said: "I have no comment on that because I don't have all the facts 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Pugh, a spokesman at the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, 
where Silberman was rushed on Saturday evening, said that toxicology and blood 
tests are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
According to health officials, Halcion 2 is a sleeping pill that would have to 
be taken in a large dosage to result in unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, who is scheduled to stand trial in April on charges stemming from a 
highly publicized and complex money-laundering case, was found by police at the 
Las Vegas Hilton early Saturday night. He was found after a two-day search that 
began when Silberman, a former top aide to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., told his 
family he was leaving San Diego to have dinner and meet with an attorney in 
Orange County. Instead, Silberman flew from Lindbergh Field to Los Angeles, 
then took a flight to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
He left the the hospital about 4 p.m. Monday, looking pale and uncomfortable, 
and walking very slowly. He was joined by his wife, San Diego County Supervisor 
Susan Golding. Outside the hospital, he kissed her on the cheek, then they left 
for the airport in Brosnahan's blue rental car. 
</P>
<P>
As reporters followed the couple out of the medical center, Brosnahan said: 
"You might want to give Mr. Silberman a little room. He's had a tough, tough 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
He has been under pressure in recent months, culminating with the release last 
week of an FBI report that alleges he confessed to participating in a 
money-laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, reputed San Diego mobster Chris Petti and three other men are 
charged with laundering $300,000 they thought was illegal drug money from 
Colombian traffickers. The cash was actually put up by an undercover FBI agent 
as part of an elaborate sting operation that was revealed upon Silberman's 
arrest last April 7. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan said that a federal judge's comment that the alleged confession was 
"self-incriminating" for Silberman prompted his client's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said the turn of events in the Silberman case could provide even 
more reason for a new judge to be assigned to it or for the trial to be heard 
outside San Diego County, where there has been very heavy media attention. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the circumstances surrounding Silberman's disappearance and subsequent 
rescue, his lawyer insisted that the public should not conclude that the 
episode was a ruse or an attempt by Silberman to win sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"They would be absolutely wrong about that," Brosnahan said. "The police 
officer in Las Vegas, the judgment of the doctors here at the hospital who have 
treated him, both in the emergency ward on Saturday night and upstairs on the 
fifth floor all day Sunday, the judgment of the nurses and all of that, make it 
very clear there is no possibility of such a thing."

SUPERCONDUCTORS WILL GET FIRST SPACE TESTING; 
</P>
<P>
SCIENCE: THE NEW DEVICES, IF THEY PROVE HARDY ENOUGH, COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE 
WEIGHT AND COST OF ORBITING ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT.

A scientific satellite to be launched next year will carry electronic circuits 
made from high-temperature superconductors for the first tests of the materials 
in space, researchers said Monday at a meeting of the American Assn. for the 
Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that the superconductors, whose existence was first reported in 
January, 1987, could reduce the weight of many electronic devices and, thus, 
the cost of putting them in orbit, but it is first necessary to see how well 
they survive in the hostile environment of Earth orbit. 
</P>
<P>
In a daylong seminar here on the high-temperature superconductors, which carry 
electricity without any loss because of resistance, scientists also said that 
they are much more enthusiastic now about the commercial development of the 
materials than they were a year ago, and that the first commercial uses could 
appear within three to five years. The superconductors could also have a 
previously unsuspected impact on the microwave electronics industry, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, researchers agreed, Japan has not taken the lead in developing 
the superconductors that had been expected. Japanese and American investment in 
the new technology has been about the same, roughly $250 million a year, and 
well ahead of other countries' spending. But in the United States, two-thirds 
of the funds have come from the government, while in Japan two-thirds have come 
from industry. 
</P>
<P>
While most Japanese companies are working on only one particular type of 
superconductor material because they think it is the most promising, they could 
have a major advantage if it proves to be most effective. 
</P>
<P>
But if another type of material proves better, said Edward J. Mead of E. I. du 
Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., "they could all go marching off the edge of the 
cliff together, like a bunch of lemmings." 
</P>
<P>
The new high-temperature superconductors were discovered at an IBM Corp. 
research laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, a feat for which the inventors won 
the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics. Previous superconductors, which were either 
metals or alloys, had lost all resistance to the flow of electricity only at 
temperatures near absolute zero, roughly minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
But the new materials, ceramics containing copper oxides and certain other 
metals, were superconducting at around minus 400 degrees and, within a year, 
researchers led by physicist PauW. Chu of the University of Houston and others, 
had raised the minimum temperature for superconductivity to minus 285 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of this achievement was that it made possible cooling with 
inexpensive liquid nitrogen rather than the much more expensive liquid helium 
used with previous superconductors. Researchers predicted a vast array of new 
applications for the materials, including magnetically levitated trains, 
long-distance transmission of electricity and exceptionally fast 
supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers encountered major difficulties. The superconductors could carry 
only limited amounts of electricity and, because they are brittle ceramics, 
cannot readily be fabricated into wires. By a year ago, the superconductivity 
community had become very discouraged about the prospects for commercializing 
the technology. 
</P>
<P>
They are regaining their enthusiasm, however. "We've entered a period of 
consolidation and the progress has been really tremendous," Chu said Monday. 
One of the most important developments, he said, was the ability to achieve 
high current-carrying capacity in thin films of the ceramic superconductors. 
</P>
<P>
These thin films can be used to produce electronic devices, such as the 
superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDS, recently perfected by 
IBM. SQUIDS are very sensitive detectors of electromagnetic radiation, and Chu 
predicted that the new SQUIDS could be marketed in as little as three years. 
</P>
<P>
The new SQUIDS could have major applications in prospecting for petroleum and 
metal ores, Chu said. Researchers inject an electrical charge into the ground 
and look for telltale minute residual electrical currents. SQUIDS are now used 
for such purposes, but the requirement for liquid-helium cooling makes them too 
cumbersome for routine use. 
</P>
<P>
No cooling at all might be needed for superconducting electronic devices used 
in satellites as long as they were shielded from direct sunlight. Four 
companies, including Du Pont, are producing superconducting electronic devices, 
such as capacitors and filters, that will be carried on a Naval Research 
Laboratory satellite to be launched sometime in 1991, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential new application for the materials is the production of 
microwave communications and radar devices. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commercial market for superconducting microwave components would 
be only about $5 million by 1995, Mead said, that technology could be 
particularly valuable to the military. Conventional microwave radars divert a 
significant amount of energy into what are known as side lobes -- emissions at 
a 90-degree angle to the main radar beam. "It is these lobes that an enemy 
locks on for detection and jamming," Mead said. The use of superconductors 
reduces the side lobes substantially. 
</P>
<P>
But all the panelists agreed that it will be well into the next decade before 
high-temperature superconductors are used for large magnets, electricity 
transmission and similar applications. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a marathon, not a sprint," Mead said.

REAGAN DENIED ILLEGAL ACTS, REPORT SAYS

Former President Ronald Reagan, in videotaped testimony last week in the 
Iran-Contra trial of his national security adviser, denied authorizing or 
knowing about any illegal activity, CBS News reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The network, quoting sources familiar with the closed testimony in a Los 
Angeles federal courtroom, reported Reagan said that under no circumstances did 
he approve or direct anyone to make false statements, conceal information or 
destroy anything to keep Congress from learning about the worst scandal of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was he aware, CBS reported Reagan testified, that any Iran-Contra activity 
was going on. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a key piece of testimony that could help the defense of former National 
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter, CBS said Reagan described as "innocuous" 
letters that Poindexter wrote to Congress asserting that the NSC staff was in 
compliance with the spirit and letter of the law regarding support of the 
Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
The letters are a critical part of Poindexter's defense. The charges against 
the retired Navy rear admiral involve obstructing a congressional inquiry and 
making false statements to Congress about arms sales to Iran and secret efforts 
to aid the Contras in their guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan government. At 
the time, Congress had banned such direct U.S. assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan reportedly gave a spirited description of his belief for the United 
States to back the Contras as well as the need for secrecy surrounding attempts 
to get Iran to release U.S. hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony marked the first time Reagan has been a witness in any of the 
trials involving the Iran-Contra scandal. He declined to answer questions from 
reporters when he left the downtown courtroom Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
During the two days of testimony, however, CBS quoted sources as saying there 
were many details that Reagan said he could not remember. And one source told 
the network that Reagan, although very alert, sometimes became confused by 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Observers told CBS that there were no claims of executive privilege by the 
former President, and little disclosure of classified information, a main 
reason why the public was barred from the courtroom.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's two-week tour of the Orient is barely half over 
and already he's been snubbed by Corazon Aquino, eaten field rations with some 
talking shrubbery in Hawaii and witnessed a full-body-contact South Korean 
press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The serious purpose of the journey -- to consult with East Asian allies about 
U.S. military strategy in the region and to pay morale-boosting visits to 
American GIs -- has sometimes been overshadowed by unscheduled events. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney barely had touched down in Honolulu a week ago Saturday when word came 
from Manila that Philippines President Aquino would not grant him an audience 
in Manila this week. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino, piqued about comments by senior U.S. officials questioning her grip on 
power and her apparent inability to stem corruption and cronyism in her 
government, said she had no time to see the Pentagon boss. She wouldn't budge, 
even after President Bush told her she might learn a few things from Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said, "I don't take it personally" and promptly scratched a day off his 
planned two-day visit to Manila. "I would hope that any unpleasantness is 
minimized," the diplomatic defense secretary said later. 
</P>
<P>
Members of his traveling party were clearly heartbroken, having been forced to 
spend an extra unoccupied day here in Hong Kong, the shopping capital of the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney's helicopter landed on a hilltop in the middle of Oahu Island last 
Monday, where he was greeted by Maj. Gen. Fred Gorden, who was to demonstrate 
Army Ranger training among troops of his 25th Infantry Division. 
</P>
<P>
The general and the SecDef, as Cheney is known to the troops, walked into an 
empty clearing in the tropical rain forest when suddenly there was a rustling 
in the bushes. Within seconds, the Secretary was surrounded by about two dozen 
Ranger trainees in full camouflage gear and war paint and covered from head to 
toe in bushes tied to their uniforms. It was an astounding sight; pictures of 
Cheney chatting earnestly with the foliage led all the Honolulu evening 
television news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Field rations, now known as MREs or "Meals, Ready-to-Eat," were handed out. 
Cheney missed out on the "patties/pork" and the "stroganoff/beef" and wound up 
with franks and beans and a cup of luminescent green "bug juice." 
</P>
<P>
He squeezed the cold franks from their vacuum-packed wrapping and downed them 
with apparent relish. Actually, there was no relish; rather, that great 
equalizer -- sauce, Tabasco -- was provided. 
</P>
<P>
Then the fun began. A young officer brought out a flip chart, field model, and 
began to brief the SecDef on the Ranger mission. It was all Cheney could do to 
keep from rolling his eyes at a spectacle he suffers all too frequently back at 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning he left Hawaii for Seoul, Cheney met with a local foreign 
affairs group and gave his standard speech on the need to maintain strong 
defenses in a time of unpredictable global upheaval. In the question period 
following the talk, an elderly gentleman stood up and reminded Cheney that he'd 
met the future defense secretary in a bar in Sheraton, Wyo., Cheney's home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"Ummm," said Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The man said he'd been a Navy duty officer at Pearl Harbor during the Japanese 
attack on Dec. 7, 1941, and asked Cheney for a favor: 
</P>
<P>
"When you get back to Washington, could you tell your boss that next year is 
the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and make sure he gets the date right?" 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 election campaign, Bush had a little trouble keeping his dates 
straight, referring to a speech he gave on Sept. 7 as marking the anniversary 
of the Japanese attack that brought the United States into World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean press corps, newly freed from years of rigid government 
control, has adopted a martial arts approach to covering the news. 
</P>
<P>
On arriving in Seoul last Tuesday night, Cheney participated in a brief 
welcoming ceremony with his host, Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon. The 
Korean camera crews set up about eight feet from the two leaders and then 
elbowed, kneed and body-blocked anyone who got in their way. 
</P>
<P>
A Korean anchorman did live, full-volume commentary during Cheney's remarks, 
nearly drowning out the American official. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, at a joint press conference at the South Korean Defense Ministry, 
the reporters and photographers really got physical, moving rows of chairs 
forward until they were virtually on top of the desk behind which the two 
officials sat. Only a strategic jab with a pen from an American reporter kept a 
Korean photographer from climbing into her lap for a better photo angle. 
</P>
<P>
The South Korean security guards assigned to the press conference could do 
nothing to control the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Astonished at the Koreans' aggressiveness, one American traveling with Cheney 
asked an American diplomat if the South Koreans always operate that way. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, that was nothing," the experienced Seoul-based U.S. official said. "They 
were on their best behavior."

Despite his success in leading fellow conservatives to victory in Sunday's 
election for the lower house of Parliament, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was on 
the defensive Monday amid widespread speculation that ruling party bosses may 
yet force him out of office toward the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinarily smooth-tongued premier was momentarily at a loss for words 
during a news conference, called after all the ballots were counted, when a 
reporter asked him whether he was certain he could serve out the rest of his 
two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
"Just watch," a flustered Kaifu replied somewhat testily. "I intend to go on 
working diligently. That's why there are terms of office, and that's why there 
is something called an electoral system." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, 59, an obscure politician with a clean record but a limited power base, 
rose last August to become nominal head of the governing Liberal Democratic 
Party, a post that automatically leads to the premiership by virtue of the 
LDP's lower house majority. The ruling party had just suffered a humiliating 
setback in an upper house election, and Kaifu's two immediate predecessors had 
been forced to resign because of influence-peddling and sex scandals. 
</P>
<P>
"My administration may have started out from rock bottom, and there have been 
ups and downs," Kaifu told reporters in a televised appearance. "But at last, 
I've made it this far and battled through the election in rough seas. Under 
law, and in fact, I have won (the people's) confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Kaifu's energetic performance on the campaign trail deserves at least 
some of the credit for the LDP's surprisingly strong showing at the polls 
Sunday. The ruling party held on to 275 of its 295 seats in the 512-member 
lower house, a stable majority that is expected to rise to the 290-seat mark 
once unaffiliated conservatives are recruited. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Kaifu may have already outlived his usefulness to the powers-that-be in the 
LDP. 
</P>
<P>
Political analysts and the media continue to ask whether he can hold out until 
the end of his term as party president, which is due to expire a year from 
November. By most accounts, Noboru Takeshita, the old-guard politician who 
resigned as prime minister because of his links to the Recruit Co. fund-raising 
scandal last June, still manipulates the party machinery from behind the 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether Mr. Kaifu can survive until the end of next year depends on Mr. 
Takeshita," said Rei Shiratori, a political science professor at Tokai 
University. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the opposition has been put in its place with Sunday's election 
triumph, the LDP appears ready to get down to the lifeblood of Japanese 
politics: intra-party intrigue. One of Takeshita's rival factional bosses, 
Shintaro Abe, is believed to be positioning himself to replace Kaifu as early 
as this autumn. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Abe is obviously anxious to be prime minister, and he's going to be 
looking for any sign of weakness in Mr. Kaifu to have an excuse," said Gerald 
L. Curtis, director of the East Asian Institute at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who together with Shiratori spoke on Monday at the Foreign 
Correspondents Club of Japan, said Kaifu's chances of remaining in office 
greatly improved with the ruling party's strong showing at the polls. But 
pending trade negotiations with the United States will "test his leadership," 
Curtis added. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese business leaders reacted with enthusiasm to the election results, 
although the Tokyo stock market took a minor plunge in Monday's trading, with 
the Nikkei index closing 237.72 points lower at 37,222.60. Investors supposedly 
were looking beyond the good news of the LDP victory and fretting about the 
possibility of another hike in Japan's official discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
But the message from Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Japan Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), was less ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
"We must praise the people for their decision not to destroy the free economy," 
Saito told reporters, equating the LDP victory with an endorsement of the 
party's pro-business slant. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, however, said support for the LDP had less to do with ideology than 
with the concern that an opposition coalition would be incapable of handling 
the affairs of state. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters were saying 'no' to opposition government in Japan," Curtis said. 
"It was a defeat for the opposition. That's why it was a victory for the LDP." 
</P>
<P>
While they were saying no to the opposition, the voters also said yes to the 
controversial right-wing LDP lawmaker, Shintaro Ishihara, who has raised 
hackles in the United States with a controversial America-bashing book -- "A 
Japan That Can Say No." The former novelist was reelected for the seventh time 
by his Tokyo constituency. 
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, the popular chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, warned against 
ascribing the LDP triumph to public acquiescence to a controversial 3% 
consumption tax. The opposition made repudiation of this LDP-sponsored tax its 
paramount campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
"In a word, people aren't looking for confusion in politics, they want 
stability," conceded Doi, whose party gained a whopping 53 seats Sunday. "But 
seeking stability isn't the same as accepting the consumption tax." 
</P>
<P>
The LDP has proposed limited revisions of the tax to make it more palatable, 
and the ability of Kaifu and the Liberal Democrats to nurture a dialogue with 
the opposition on tax-related legislation will be a test of the ruling party's 
mastery of the domestic political situation.

</P>
<P>
ELECTION: LOPSIDED APPORTIONMENT FAVORS RURAL AREAS OVER CITIES. BUT EVEN UNDER 
A 'FAIR' SYSTEM, THE RULING PARTY WOULD HAVE WON SUNDAY.

TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 4th District of Kanagawa Prefecture (state), a dormitory area for the 
Tokyo-Yokohama megalopolis, 1,347,435 voters elect four representatives to the 
House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the Japan Alps 3rd District of Nagano Prefecture, 427,478 voters also 
cast ballots for four members of the lower house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the anomalies of Japan's electoral system, where one vote in the 
countryside can be worth three in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
The lopsided apportionment is often cited by American trade negotiators, who 
for years have been trying to persuade Japan to open its markets to imports of 
rice and other farm products. Some U.S. officials even have charged that the 
conservative Liberal Democratic Party keeps itself in power by inflating the 
value of the rural vote. 
</P>
<P>
So do Japanese critics. Newspapers and scholars routinely report that farmers' 
support is critical to the Liberal Democrats' maintaining their control of the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
But an examination by The Times of the results in Sunday's election for the 
lower house showed that, with Japan's present system of multi-member 
constituencies -- most with three to five seats apiece -- Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu's party would have won the election even if the chamber's present 
512 seats had been reapportioned to have roughly equal numbers of voters. It 
also would have won the last lower house election four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both contests would have been much closer, however. Instead of finishing with a 
majority of 34 seats, the Liberal Democrats probably would have scraped through 
Sunday with the kind of razor-thin margin that political analysts initially had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the analysis underscores one point made by the critics: 
distribution of seats in Japan's multi-member constituencies is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
With 90,578,761 eligible voters, a reshuffling that would assign one 
representative to each 176,911 voters -- the nationwide population average for 
the 512 districts -- would have produced a reapportionment in 99 of the 130 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
So out of whack is the system that only one of Tokyo's 11 districts has the 
proper number of seats for its population. Six districts are under-represented, 
while four others are over-represented. 
</P>
<P>
Because the number of candidates would increase or decrease depending on the 
number of seats at stake, any application of a one-man, one-vote analysis to an 
actual election can offer only an indication of a likely trend. But The Times' 
examination showed that 44 Liberal Democrats won seats Sunday that should not 
have existed in over-represented districts. Fourteen other Liberal Democrats 
who lost would have won if their districts had not been under-represented. 
</P>
<P>
The difference, or 30 fewer seats, theoretically would have trimmed the party's 
victory to a four-seat majority. Four years ago, instead of a 54-seat majority, 
their margin would have been about 30 seats. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier, nip-and-tuck elections, the result, indeed, would have been a 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Socialists, who scored the biggest gains in their history, also 
would not have done as well Sunday. Socialist winners in 11 districts would 
have lost under a more equal apportionment. And no Socialist loser would have 
benefitted. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest beneficiaries would have been precisely the parties that suffered 
the biggest setbacks: the Communists and the middle-of-the-road Democratic 
Socialist Party. Their power base is concentrated in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
While the farm vote is important -- so much so that the Socialists have become 
more protectionist in their agricultural policies than the Liberal Democrats -- 
the rural clout does not, by itself, explain the perennial conservative grasp 
on power. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, last July, far from sustaining the Liberal Democrats, the farm vote 
contributed to their defeat in an upper house election. Conservatives lost all 
of their seats in the rice-rich Tohoku (northeast) region and on the mikan 
(mandarin orange) island of Shikoku. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly had vote counting ended Monday when 11 complainants in Tokyo and 
Hiroshima once again filed separate suits demanding that courts rule the Sunday 
election a violation of the constitution's guarantee of equal representation. 
If past cases are a guide, the suits are unlikely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's court system, prone to hand down judgments based more on custom and the 
status quo than on the letter of the law, has consistently refused to insist on 
reapportionment of seats. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the court ruled that a 2.99 to 1 discrepancy in population and 
a 2.92 to 1 imbalance in voters is acceptable. In 1986, Parliament 
reapportioned seats to reduce the maximum mismatch to 2.99 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu has promised to carry out another reapportionment as part of a political 
reform package to be presented on the 100th anniversary of the founding of 
Japan's parliamentary system this fall. But no one is holding his breath. 
</P>
<P>
Although everyone agrees that seats need to be reapportioned, no one is calling 
for a one-man, one-vote system. 
</P>
<P>
Even the perennial opposition Socialists and Communists demand only that the 
discrepancy be reduce to less than 2 to 1.

6 DEAD IN FLOOD-BATTERED SOUTH; MORE HEAVY RAIN MAY BE COMING

<P>
Flooding continued Monday across the South, with at least six deaths blamed on 
high water, and about 7,000 residents of east-central Illinois at Champaign 
remained without electricity after snow and ice storms knocked out power lines 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said that a new round of storms, possibly 
producing heavy rainfall, could reach the South by Wednesday, with a threat of 
more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes in Mississippi, 
Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The floods since late last week have been blamed for six deaths in Georgia, 
Mississippi, Alabama and North Carolina. One man was reported missing Monday in 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
In Copperhill, Tenn., raw sewage from a storm-damaged waste treatment plant 
bubbled in the streets of the flood-ravaged old mining town of 418 people on 
Monday, forcing families to boil their drinking water. The mayor imposed a 
dusk-to-dawn curfew for the third day to prevent looting. 
</P>
<P>
The rain-swollen Ocoee River rampaged from its banks Friday and inundated 
Copperhill's business district with 8 feet of turbulent waters. The flood 
swamped 34 homes and 50 businesses, 90% of Copperhill's business district, and 
water rose to the second-story levels of some buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, business owners mopped mud from their stores, and some said they had 
yet to decide whether to open again.

AN EXERCISE IN COMMON SENSE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOCK YOURSELF OUT AT THE GYM TO LIVE LONGER. A NEW 
STUDY SAYS MODERATE EXERCISE IS ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Face it. There are millions of people out there for whom the exercise 
prescription should be get up off your butt and take a walk. Get out the door. 
Do something." 
</P>
<P>
If researcher Steven N. Blair sounds frustrated when he gives this earthy 
assessment of America's physical fitness, it's because he is. 
</P>
<P>
Americans largely have ignored more than two decades of advice that they sweat 
their way into tiptop cardiovascular shape, the Dallas epidemiologist says, so 
it's time to give them a new message: A little bit of exercise is good enough. 
</P>
<P>
And Blair really means it. With a recent study at Dallas' Institute for 
Aerobics Research as a guide, he has developed what he thinks is the bare 
minimum a person has to do to vastly reduce the risk of dying prematurely -- 
and it isn't all that much. 
</P>
<P>
No, you don't have to get up daily at the crack of dawn to huff and puff 
through the streets. No, you don't have to find a baby-sitter available for 
just one hour a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
A brisk two-mile walk three times a week is all it takes, Blair says. For men, 
the two miles should be covered in 27 minutes or less; for women, 30 minutes or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't walk at that 3- to 4-m.p.h. pace at first, you can take up to 40 
minutes in the beginning -- but women would have to do it five to six days a 
week and men six or seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Judged by the "aerobic points" system, which classifies exercise based on how 
much oxygen it causes one to use, that amounts to a minimum of 15 aerobic 
points a week for women, and 18 aerobic points a week for men. Other exercise 
adding up to that total amount could be substituted for the walking, he noted. 
(People under 50 need a bit more exercise than the minimum, and people over 50 
can get by with a bit less.) 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't make any difference what you do, as long as you expend the energy," 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
But that's about half as much exercise as has been advocated for the last two 
decades by Dr. Kenneth Cooper, the fitness guru who coined the term aerobics 
back in 1968. Cooper founded the Cooper Clinic and the aerobics institute where 
Blair does his research. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who co-authored the recent study on which Blair bases his 
recommendations, agrees that it's time to emphasize that people don't have to 
train like Florence Griffith-Joyner to gain the health benefits of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
This new exercise prescription for the masses "doesn't even look like a routine 
physical conditioning program. All it really is is avoiding inactivity," Cooper 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are at least 30 million Americans out there who are dying 
younger than they need to just because they're totally inactive," he said. 
"They say, 'I'm not an athlete, I don't have time, I don't have the money.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we've eliminated those excuses now. Because you don't have to join a 
health club, you don't have to buy expensive equipment, you don't have to have 
a friend or partner to play with you," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
In a November paper based on data collected at the Cooper Clinic, researchers 
showed that the largest difference in mortality -- about 60% -- was between the 
sedentary and people who were only moderately fit, as judged by performance on 
treadmill exercise tests. 
</P>
<P>
Over an 11-year period, the sedentary men had an overall death rate of 64 per 
10,000 person-years of participation in the study. The moderately fit had a 
death rate of 26 per 10,000 person-years. Among women, the mortality rate fell 
from 40 to 16. 
</P>
<P>
This translates into one to three extra years of life for the moderately fit, 
Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, improving one's fitness beyond this moderate level did decrease 
mortality, but not by much. The high-fitness group had death rates of 20 per 
10,000 person-years for men and seven per 10,000 for women. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, especially if you're a man, you don't have to become an 
exercise fanatic to gain most of the death-postponing benefits of exercise. 
</P>
<P>
To quantify the exercise needed, Blair compared the study's findings to the 
exercise records kept on people who work out at an aerobics center affiliated 
with the Cooper Clinic. How much weekly exercising did it take for those people 
to have treadmill times classifying them as "moderately fit" by the study's 
standards, he asked. The result was the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A survey last year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found that only 8% 
of Americans get as much exercise as government health officials recommend. 
</P>
<P>
That recommendation basically is that healthy adults should spend 15 to 25 
minutes a day, three to four days a week, doing some form of exercise vigorous 
enough to elevate breathing and heart rates but not so vigorous that it becomes 
impossible to talk comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
(The American College of Sports Medicine recommends exercise sessions of 15 to 
60 minutes, three to five days a week.) 
</P>
<P>
The survey found another 34% of adults were "regularly active," which the CDC 
defined as doing some kind of physical activity at least three times a week for 
a minimum of 20 minutes each time. 
</P>
<P>
If that 34% exercised a bit more, and other Americans could be coaxed off their 
living room couches, there would be less fat, more muscle and fewer early 
deaths, Blair says. 
</P>
<P>
Such advice is of particular importance for California's burgeoning Latino 
population. Government surveys show obesity -- which is a factor in many 
chronic diseases -- to be higher among Latinos than other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Among Latino middle school students in the Montebello School District, 51% of 
girls and 41% of boys had body fat composition in the high or very high level, 
a study by Cal Poly Pomona researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
The National Hispanic Health and Nutrition Survey found that among 
Mexican-American adults, 39% of women and 31% of men are overweight. Nearly 
half of those women and a third of those men are severely overweight. 
</P>
<P>
For the average American, the modified Cooper Clinic exercise prescription in 
essence promotes the idea of a new category of physical fitness -- one beyond 
the high-fitness image that advertising gives. 
</P>
<P>
Ads imply that the only exercise is the extremely vigorous kind, and that it is 
the sole province of the young, the beautiful and the physically gifted, Blair 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"These people don't look like most of us look. We're not all young and lean and 
attractive," Blair says as he laughingly points to his own balding head and 
chunky physique. "My mother looks at those ads and she says, 'Well, I can never 
look like that. I'm too old and fat and therefore to heck with it. I'm one of 
the slobs.' " 
</P>
<P>
There is "a dichotomous view of exercise in the mind of the American public," 
Blair says. "You're either Jane Fonda, a marathon runner, a triathlete or 
you're a slob -- when, in fact, this is a continuum." 
</P>
<P>
For people who have trouble sticking with an exercise program, science has more 
good news: There are hints that both sporadic exercise and shorter bouts of it 
are like a "good-health pill" for the body. 
</P>
<P>
Biochemical changes from just a few exercise sessions include greater insulin 
sensitivity of cells, resulting in better carbohydrate metabolism, and lower 
levels of fat-carrying triglycerides in the blood, said William Haskell, 
associate professor of medicine at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
And as the exercise prescription moves toward being more real, so are the 
activities that one can use to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 study at the University of Minnesota found that men who got an average 
of 47 minutes a day of exercise -- mainly by mowing the lawn, gardening and 
working around the house -- had markedly fewer heart attack deaths than did 
sedentary men. And, as in the Blair research, mortality didn't improve much 
beyond that in men of higher fitness levels. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, although a rule of thumb in the past has been that one needs to 
expend at least 2,000 calories weekly on vigorous, sustained exercise to gain 
cardiovascular benefit, these men averaged about 1,500 calories a week on 
activities that amounted mainly to puttering around the house. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Weldon, a Los Angeles athletic trainer who specializes in fitness training 
for individuals, said she agrees with the Blair/Cooper push to move Americans 
away from thinking of themselves as exercise nobodies if they aren't running 
marathons regularly. 
</P>
<P>
However, people looking for a personal fitness prescription should keep in mind 
the need for flexibility and gradual muscle strengthening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously we have to have the heart and lungs working well to increase our 
longevity, but I work on so many of the musculoskeletal pains that I also 
emphasize that you need to have some flexibility in the muscles to support the 
structures around them," Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
Regular stretching and mild weight training can address those issues and even 
improve balance in the elderly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute for Aerobics Research recently was funded by the National 
Institute on Aging to continue its studies of exercise and fitness, this time 
trying to determine the relationship between regular exercise and chronic 
illnesses and disability. The results of the five-year study could be more 
important than looking at mortality, Blair suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather run out of life than run out of function," Blair said. 
"And if you ask your parents, your grandparents, what do they fear. It's not 
dying, it's those two words: nursing home. Our hypothesis is that some -- we 
have no idea how much -- of the disability that we see in older individuals is 
a result of sedentary living." 
</P>
<P>
NEW Rx FOR EXERCISE 
</P>
<P>
The aerobic points system classifies exercise based on how much oxygen it 
causes one to use. Younger people probably need to do a little more exercise, 
and older people a little less. 
</P>
<P>
MEN 
</P>
<P>
Aerobic points: 18-36. Minimum activity needed: Walk two miles in less than 27 
minutes at least three days per week. Or walk two miles in 30-40 minutes, six 
to seven days per week. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN 
</P>
<P>
Aerobic points: 15-24. Minimum activity needed: Walk two miles in less than 30 
minutes at least three days per week. Or walk two miles in 30-40 minutes five 
to six days per week.

SAFETY OF BOTTLED WATER IS AFFIRMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, the irony. A North Carolina laboratory director was using Perrier water as 
a standard of purity to test municipal water quality when he detected traces of 
benzene, a chemical known to cause cancer in animals, in the bottled water, 
according to North Carolina Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Patty 
McQuillan. The director's discovery, reported immediately to the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration, ultimately led to a global recall of the French water -- 
and to hasty reassurances from experts that Perrier lovers need not fear any 
ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
But last week's recall has left bottled water drinkers wondering: Are other 
brands safe? And who keeps an eye on the industry? 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers -- especially those in California -- can rest easy," said William 
Deal, executive vice president of the International Bottled Water Assn. (IBWA), 
an Alexandria, Va.-based trade group representing most domestic bottled water 
companies and many importers. California's regulations governing bottled water 
processing are the most stringent in the nation, Deal said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last five years, California laws governing bottled water and water 
vending machines have been revised four times, " said Jack Sheneman, a 
scientist with the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health 
Services. These changes have tightened standards for maximum lead levels, among 
other substances, and spelled out more stringent regulations covering water 
haulers and others in the industry. California bottled water plants are 
inspected at least once a year, Sheneman said. 
</P>
<P>
On the federal level, bottled water is considered a food, subject to regulation 
by the FDA. (Tap water comes under the jurisdiction of the Environmental 
Protection Agency.) "FDA inspectors make regular rounds at bottling plants," 
said Emil Corwin, spokesman for the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied 
Nutrition. "Inspectors look for color, odor, clarity, chemical quality and 
physical plant cleanliness." 
</P>
<P>
(Traces of benzene crept into the Perrier, company officials say, because 
workers at the plant in France failed to change a filter.) 
</P>
<P>
Bottled water labeling is strictly regulated as well. Spring water, for 
instance, must flow naturally to the earth from an underground formation, while 
purified water must be filtered and then purified by reverse osmosis or 
deionization. (See accompanying glossary for explanations of other bottled 
water labels.) 
</P>
<P>
Most bottled water manufacturers belong to the IBWA, which has its own code of 
standards, supports federal labeling guidelines and insists on its own annual 
inspection of every bottling plant, which are "performed by an independent 
third party," Deal said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers should put the Perrier contamination in perspective, says an Oklahoma 
City water expert. The traces of benzene in Perrier might have gone undetected 
in the past, says Charles Lawrence, vice chairman of the Department of 
Environmental Health at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analytical capability has grown so fast we can now measure substances in 
parts-per-billion (PPBS) and parts-per-trillion (PPT) that used to go 
undetected," Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't think bottled water is necessarily any safer than tap water. "But 
water -- bottled or tap -- is the safest beverage we have," he says. "There are 
more carcinogens in peanut butter, coffee, tea, beer and wine."

SPOTTING PATCHES OF SUNBURN CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health-conscious sun worshipers -- already bogged down with beach bags full of 
sunglasses and sunscreen -- might consider throwing in one more item: Sun 
Spots. 
</P>
<P>
The small adhesive patches, manufactured by a Delaware firm, are promoted as an 
easy way to determine when sunscreen has worn off. 
</P>
<P>
Sunbathers slather the same amount of sunscreen on the patch as themselves and 
place it on their skin or a nearby beach towel. "When the sunscreen wears off, 
the spot turns red," says a company spokeswoman. A 10-pack costs $2.98, a 
20-pack is $3.98. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carl S. Korn, a Sherman Oaks dermatologist and a USC clinical assistant 
professor of medicine, says the spots probably work. "And I guess they're 
cheaper than buying a watch, unless you can find one with an alarm for 99 
cents. But he wonders: "Will people go to the trouble to use these spots?"

THE ABCS OF TAKING VITAMIN SUPPLEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Popping a vitamin pill is as natural a habit as toothbrushing for legions of 
Americans. By 1992, U.S. vitamin sales will reach nearly $6 billion, according 
to marketing analysts, despite some softening of demand. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics say it's an unnecessary habit -- even potentially hazardous if taken 
to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say regular intake of supplemental vitamins is especially vital, 
since hectic life styles make it difficult to eat a balanced diet. They say 
supplements can also help ward off colds and other ills. 
</P>
<P>
The question's been debated for years, and there's still no consensus. Is 
taking vitamins a waste of time and money? Here are two experts' views: 
</P>
<P>
* YES: Dr. Fredrick Stare, professor of nutrition, Harvard School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
"Vitamins are a waste for the majority of Americans. Nobody in my family takes 
them, nor do I know any colleagues who do. The average person has an adequate 
diet. The focus should be on eating a variety of foods from what we call the 
basic four food groups (milk products, meat/poultry, vegetables/fruits and 
breads/cereals) and maintaining variety within the basic four." 
</P>
<P>
Exercise can't hurt either, he says. "The trouble is, most people consume too 
many calories in relation to their physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
"You can live a long life without vitamins. The last time I took vitamins was 
as a medical school student -- and then only because they were free samples." 
</P>
<P>
* NO: Dr. Gershon M. Lesser, Los Angeles internist and preventive health 
advocate. 
</P>
<P>
"The average person, conscious of the need to reduce daily caloric intake for 
weight maintenance and better health, is not likely to take in adequate levels 
of needed vitamins and minerals on a daily basis. For example, a woman needs 18 
milligrams of iron a day (although the current RDA specifies 15 milligrams). A 
typical diet provides only about 6 milligrams per 1,000 calories, which means 
an average woman must consume 3,000 calories a day, or twice the ideal. To 
complicate matters, food has been aged, packaged, processed and bankrupted of 
its nutritive value. 
</P>
<P>
"Numerous studies have shown that appropriate doses of Vitamins A, C, D and E 
protect against cancer, slow the aging process and heighten immune system 
functioning, and that nearly 30% to 50% of us are deficient in one or more of 
these vitamins at any given time. Vitamins aren't a substitute for good 
nutrition. They are just good insurance."

WIDOW, 92, TO KEEP SAVINGS IN CIVIL LIABILITY APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
BENNINGTON, Vt. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 92-year-old widow initially held financially liable for a nephew's car 
accident will be able to keep her life's savings under a settlement reached 
today in a closely watched civil liability case. 
</P>
<P>
"I did, I did win," Luella Wilson told reporters who swarmed to her home after 
the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"Any man with common sense would know I didn't owe that money," she said, 
sipping a celebratory shot of Southern Comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was slapped with a $950,000 judgment after a car driven by her 
great-nephew plunged off a bridge, leaving one of his passengers, Mark Vince, 
unable to walk. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was home in bed the night of the April, 1984, crash but she was found 
liable for Vince's injuries under a legal doctrine known as "negligent 
entrustment." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson had loaned her great-nephew, Willard Stuart Jr., the money to buy the 
car. Vince's lawyers claimed that Wilson was liable because she knew or should 
have known that Stuart did not have a driver's license and had a problem with 
alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that she had spent $98,000 in legal fees and that the award would 
clean out the remainder of her savings. Although she amassed a bank account of 
$600,000 during a long and colorful life, the legal problems left her partly 
dependent on Meals on Wheels for food. 
</P>
<P>
The Vermont Supreme Court ordered a retrial of the 1987 award. Opening 
statements were heard today, and one witness had begun testimony in Bennington 
Superior Court when the attorneys for Vince, Wilson and the dealership that 
sold the car went behind closed doors. They emerged from chambers shortly after 
with news of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but attorneys for both Wilson and 
Ace Auto Sales Inc. said the elderly widow will be able to keep her money and 
her property. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Wilson is going to get everything back, and why shouldn't she settle 
under those terms?" said her attorney, Fred Harlow. "I'm ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
"It's over. She has won," said Michael Madden, Wilson's live-in caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
Vince, who is paralyzed and whose left leg was amputated as a result of the 
accident, declined to discuss the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to be like this for the rest of my life. I'll never be happy," he 
said as he was helped from his wheelchair to a car. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain anything about the settlement. There was an agreement. I just 
want to get on with my life," said Vince, now 28. "I'm happy it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
Stuart, now 24, is a laborer. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's plight drew national media attention and became the focus of a legal 
debate over how far a civil plaintiff should be able to reach when looking for 
the proverbial "deep pocket."

SOVIETS APPROVE PRIVATE HOLDING OF FARMLAND 
</P>

<P>
Soviet legislators, in a decision that effectively reverses Josef Stalin's 
years of bloody collectivization, today approved in principle a bill that would 
permit the private ownership of farmland -- something once viewed as a 
fundamental betrayal of Communist ideals. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation is among the most important to be discussed by this session of 
the Supreme Soviet because it is the basis of government hopes to increase farm 
production and thus correct severe economic shortfalls that have led to chronic 
and widespread food shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"If our debates and meetings are destined to go down in history, it will be due 
to the adoption of this land law," Russian writer Vasily Belov told the 
legislature from the podium in a Kremlin hall, drawing applause. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said the country's current consumer crisis 
presents the most serious challenge to his rule. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with a draft property law already approved in principle, the two bills 
for the first time offer the possibility of a mixed Soviet economy that would 
include some private enterprise. The property bill provides for individual 
ownership of means of production. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev initially proposed last year changing the land law to permit private 
leasing or ownership of land and to give farmers the right to pass land on to 
their children. Private garden plots, permitted since the time of Stalin, have 
long disproportionately contributed to the country's food supply, with goods 
from those plots sold in so-called "free markets." 
</P>
<P>
But conservatives and even some moderates opposed the Gorbachev proposal, 
saying it compromised the principles of communism, could lead to land 
speculation and might actually further damage the economy by encouraging an 
abrupt discarding of collective farms and undue reliance on unprepared 
individual farmers.

As oil spill-damaged areas continued to diminish, Newport Beach city officials 
today decided to extend beach openings southward from the Newport Harbor jetty 
through the city limit in Corona Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Officials may open the beach through the Newport Pier commercial area as early 
as Wednesday, depending on a walk-through inspection scheduled today, Newport 
Beach Fire Department Capt. Ray Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Public beaches are now accessible between Newport's 15th Street and Cameo 
Shores Road. Officials on Monday opened a stretch of sand between the west 
harbor jetty and 15th Street, the first to open since the spill closed 14 miles 
of shoreline between Seal Beach and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Huntington Beach coastline remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration today began new surveys of the ocean floor around the offshore 
mooring where an oil tanker spilled 394,000 gallons of crude on Feb. 7, Coast 
Guard officials said. Hydrographic surveyors are checking for errors in depth 
charts that detail vessel-approach lanes to an oil pipeline near the mooring 
operated by Golden West Refining Co., said Coast Guard Petty Officer Tim Rowe. 
Authorities have said inaccurate chart readings could explain why the tanker 
American Trader was impaled on its own anchor.

<P>
Michael Powell, director of "The Red Shoes," "The Life and Death of Colonel 
Blimp" and 30 other films, has died, the National Film Archive announced today. 
He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Powell became ill in New York two weeks ago and was flown by private jet to his 
home at Avening in Gloucestershire, the announcement said. He died Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"Of his generation, he was unquestionably the most innovative and most 
creatively brilliant filmmaker this country ever boasted," director Sir Richard 
Attenborough said. 
</P>
<P>
Teamed with screenwriter Emeric Pressburger, who died in 1988, Powell first 
made "Spy in Black" in 1938, devised for the German actor Conrad Veidt. Veidt 
starred in the next Pressburger-Powell film, "Contraband." 
</P>
<P>
"49th Parallel" followed in 1940 and won an Academy Award in the United States 
where it was shown under the title "The Original Story of the Invaders." It was 
based on a story by Pressburger about a Nazi submarine crew on the run in 
wartime Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Shoes" of 1948 was about a ballerina, played by Moira Shearer in her 
first screen role. 
</P>
<P>
Powell's last film was "Return to the Edge of the World" in 1979.

Rock-throwing protesters demanding greater democracy battled club-wielding riot 
police around the Legislature today, burning police vans and smashing windows. 
</P>
<P>
At least 80 people were injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out after about 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the 
Legislature to harass aging lawmakers of the governing Nationalist Party 
entering the building to elect a new speaker of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, mostly supporters of the opposition Democratic Progressive 
Party, are demanding that the aging politicians, who last faced election on the 
Chinese mainland more than 40 years ago and dominate the assembly, be replaced 
by Taiwan-elected lawmakers.

A blueberry poppy seed brunch cake won $40,000 for a marathon-running tax 
accountant today in the 34th Pillsbury Bake-Off Cooking and Baking Contest. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Rahman of Petaluma, Calif., a graduate student at Golden Gate University 
and a mother of two, won with a cake judges said offered a refreshing flavor 
blend of blueberry, lemon and poppy seed, combined with easy preparation and an 
appealing appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Rahman also won a $10,000 kitchen makeover from Bake-Off co-sponsor Sears. 
</P>
<P>
One man and four other women also won $10,000, and two men were among the 
$2,000 winners. 
</P>
<P>
En route to selecting the 100 finalists in December, including a record 12 men, 
Pillsbury considered more than 100,000 recipes in four general groups -- 
Indulgent Treats, Healthful Alternatives, Ethnic Specialties and Quick Ideas, 
the latter being the group in which Rahman's cake was entered.

A new government report today estimated that smoking costs the nation more than 
$52 billion a year, largely for health care expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that the 
cost of smoking-related disease averages $1 billion per state but said some 
states pay a much higher price than others. 
</P>
<P>
California, the most populous state, has the highest costs, $5.8 billion. The 
economic cost is lowest in Alaska, where it is $82 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting the report at a hearing by the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan called on 
tobacco companies to stop targeting women, minorities and young people. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that while Americans have a personal responsibility to protect 
their health, tobacco companies and advertisers also must be responsible.

Deere &amp; Co. today reported a 62% jump in quarterly earnings over the prior 
year, as sales in all categories of tractors, combines and farm implements 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
For the company's first quarter, earnings rose to $78.5 million, or $1.04 per 
share, on revenue of $1.64 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier Deere earned $48.4 million, or 65 cents per share, on revenue of 
$1.14 billion.

In a statement, the suburban Glenview-based company said results for its Zenith

DOW PLUNGES 38.74 AS GLOBAL INTEREST RISES

<P>
The stock market dropped sharply today as an upward trend in worldwide interest 
rates troubled traders, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 38.74 points to 2,596.85. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 320 up, 1,267 down and 380 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 147.30 million shares, against 174.63 million in 
Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost 2.38 to 181.37. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index lost 3.89 to 354.88. 
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the tone for the session was set by rising interest rates in 
Japan and West Germany as U.S. traders returned after the long Presidents Day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The worry on Japan rates is really what is hurting us," said Daniel Williams, 
head position trader for Dillon, Read &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds plunged in early trading today following a surge 
in interest rates overseas and unexpectedly upbeat remarks from Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan on the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough day here in bond land," said Kevin Flanagan, a money market 
economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 1 1/4 point, or about $12.50 per 
$1,000 face value, by midday. Its yield, which rises when its price falls, shot 
up to 8.63% from 8.46% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said a sharp hike in interest rates in the public bond markets of 
Japan and West Germany helped trigger today's sell-off. 
</P>
<P>
As rates rise overseas, U.S. rates often follow suit to remain competitive, 
thereby pushing bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the downward pressure on prices were comments Greenspan made in his 
annual appearance before Congress today, Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the economy has likely passed the danger point for an imminent 
recession. He predicted continued, albeit modest, economic growth for the rest 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony bolstered the belief among many private economists that the Fed 
isn't likely to move soon to push interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
Some economists said bond prices also were hurt by concerns of a recent deluge 
in available government securities following last week's federal bankruptcy 
filing of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Treasury Department said today it will borrow $6 billion more 
than previously announced during the January-March quarter to meet the 
requirements of the savings and loan bailout. That put pressure on Treasury 
bill yields, since the government said the additional funds will be obtained 
through regular auctions of weekly three- and six-month bills and 52-week 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
By midday in the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues slid between 1/4 point and 3/8 point, intermediate maturities 
were 3/8 point to 3/4 point lower, and long-term issues plunged as much as 1 
1/4 point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, stood at 1,151.60, down 8.69. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, yields on three-month Treasury bills jumped to 8.02% as the discount 
rose 11 basis points to 7.78%. Yields on six-month bills climbed to 8.12% as 
the discount increased 7 basis points to 7.72%. Yields on one-year bills rose 
to 8.21% as the discount soared 13 basis points to 7.65%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at midday at 8 3/16%, unchanged from late Friday.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and General Dynamics Corp., maker of the widely 
used F-16 warplane, have reached final agreement on developing the FSX jet 
fighter for Japan's air force, the Japanese company said today. 
</P>
<P>
The joint project was approved in principle by the two governments last year 
but has been plagued by U.S.-Japanese wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan Administration pressured Tokyo into building the plane with an 
American company rather than the Japanese developing the plane by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. congressional opposition forced renegotiation of the deal as previously 
laid out in a 1988 pact after critics said it would give Japan advanced U.S. 
technology that it could use to compete in making commercial aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis-based General Dynamics, the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, is to 
handle 35% of the $7-billion project to build 120 aircraft.

HONESTY IS COLLINS' SUCCESS SECRET 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Collins' afternoon television talk show lacks the gimmicks and hype of 
some of his competitors, but his audience keeps coming back. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, easygoing Collins says the secret of his success as a 
talk-show host is just being himself -- riding with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that there's a truth that will prevail," he said, "if you are able to 
just go with it. By that, I mean you acknowledge what is going on" without 
trying to control the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Collins has been successfully acknowledging what is going on for nearly 10 
years now, first as host of "Hour Magazine" and now as interlocutor of ABC's 
"The Home Show." 
</P>
<P>
"You see a lot of people on the air who continue to hold an attitude while all 
hell is breaking loose," he says. "What I've always done is I say, 'Hey, I'm in 
trouble here. I might as well let the folks at home know about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
One of those tight moments came when he found himself with 12 minutes to fill 
when the ballots at the "Miss America Pageant" failed to materialize on cue. 
Instead of vamping for that time, Collins marched to the judges (cameras in 
tow) and gasped, "What do you mean you don't have the ballots? How about giving 
me the runner-up and let me talk to her for 12 minutes?" 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old Collins didn't start out to be Mr. Congeniality. He got into 
the business on a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
He was performing in some plays in the Army when someone asked if he'd like to 
audition for radio. He auditioned in France on a Friday. And on Monday, he was 
winging his way to Frankfurt, West Germany, with the Armed Forces Network. 
</P>
<P>
After the service, Collins tried to find work in radio in Los Angeles. But the 
competition was unrelenting, and Collins had not really developed a style 
unique enough for that buyers' market. 
</P>
<P>
"So I quickly abandoned that and went to work at the May Co.," he said. There, 
Collins sold preppy clothes to college freshmen until his acting career got 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
He tried hosting a couple of daytime TV game shows, but it was his stints on 
telethons across the U.S. with his wife (former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley) 
that really taught him his hosting techniques, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have three children, a son, 26, and two daughters, 25 and 21. Of 
those three, it's the youngest daughter who wants to be in show business. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't bother him, he says. But he has his fingers crossed that she'll 
choose a behind-the-camera job. 
</P>

'MISS DAISY' KEEPS ON DRIVING IN NO. 1 POSITION

<P>
Fueled by its nine Academy Award nominations, Warner Bros.' "Driving Miss 
Daisy" continued on its box office roll over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 film at the box office, "Daisy's" ticket sales jumped an estimated 
44% over the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Universal Pictures' "Born on the Fourth of July" -- which earned 
eight Oscar nominations -- ranked No. 5 and jumped only an estimated 22% over 
the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving Miss Daisy," an uplifting comedy-drama about the decadeslong 
relationship between an eccentric Southern Jewish matron (Jessica Tandy) and 
her patient black chauffeur (Morgan Freeman), earned more than $10 million over 
the four days, for total ticket sales of more than $43 million. Tandy, Freeman 
and co-star Dan Aykroyd were all nominated for acting awards. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales for "Fourth of July," which chronicles Ron Kovic's grim odyssey 
from gung-ho soldier to anti-war activist, were an estimated $4.3 million, for 
cumulative receipts of about $53 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among new and recent entries, "Hard to Kill" continued to prove hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Starring Steven Seagal as a hotshot cop out to get even with "the bad guys," 
the Warner Bros.' release claimed the No. 2 spot with an estimated $8.7 million 
in ticket sales. In just two weeks, "Hard to Kill" has earned about $18 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia Pictures' "Revenge," starring Kevin Costner, opened to about $6.4 
million in ticket sales, for the No. 3 spot. In fourth place was Orion 
Pictures' comedy with John Larroquette and Kirstie Alley, "Madhouse," with 
ticket sales of more than $5 million.

IT'S FINALLY OFFICIAL; ZAHN TO JOIN 'CBS THIS MORNING'

<P>
CBS News made it official today, announcing that former ABC anchorwoman Paula 
Zahn will succeed Kathleen Sullivan as co-anchor of "CBS This Morning" starting 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' formal announcement came after two weeks of news reports that the move was 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan indirectly confirmed the shift during her farewell to viewers Friday. 
Her CBS contract expires in November. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Sorenson, the program's executive producer, said today that "it wasn't so 
much that we wanted to replace Kathleen as that we wanted to get Paula Zahn. It 
was one of those judgment calls that you make." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 36, was co-host of the show with Harry Smith since it began in 
November, 1987. Like Zahn, 33, she was a morning news anchorwoman at ABC before 
joining CBS. Both had also worked at KCBS in Los Angeles, as had Sorenson. 
</P>
<P>
They called Zahn's agent to ask when her ABC News contract ended and she'd be 
available for contract talks, he said. He quoted the agent, Richard Leibner, as 
saying there were only eight days in February when she'd be available. 
</P>
<P>
Sorenson said CBS officials were impressed with Zahn when she recently filled 
in for Joan Lunden on ABC's "Good Morning America" for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Sorenson said he and CBS News President David Burke spent three days weighing 
the pros and cons of hiring Zahn, "and it was not an easy decision because 
Kathleen is a hell of a broadcaster." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said in a phone interview, the show's ratings "hadn't exactly been 
going through the roof" and there was a need to make a long-range decision for 
the show.

Barbara Bush said the listlessness of her dog Millie is due more to jealousy 
than illness. 
</P>
<P>
"George is convinced she's sick, but it really is because she's jealous of her 
son," a big, bounding dog who belongs to one of Bush's sons and frequently 
visits the White House, Mrs. Bush said Monday during a visit to the village 
center 1 1/2 miles from the Bush family compound. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more in the mind than the body," she said as local children petted the 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Mrs. Bush chatted with reporters aboard Air Force One on the trip back 
to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the President's suggestion the day before that he might invite Soviet 
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to their Maine home, Mrs. Bush said her husband had 
not told her about it. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "You know me. Anybody he asks -- I'll be nice to."

Britain's Prince Charles put down his polo mallet for a film role as he 
continued his efforts for wildlife conservation during a visit to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Charles made an animal conservation film for the British Broadcasting Corp. 
during a three-hour visit Monday to the Kennedy Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
Filming took place at a national wildlife refuge, part of the 88,000-acre space 
center and home to eagles and hundreds of other bird species, alligators, wild 
pigs, deer and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Forrest McCartney, space center director, also escorted Charles on a tour of 
the shuttle launch control center and an assembly building. The group saw from 
a distance the launch pad where the shuttle Atlantis is being readied for 
liftoff Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
During the three days preceding his visit to the cape, the heir to the British 
throne was in Vero Beach, where he participated in two polo matches to benefit 
a wildlife protection organization. 
</P>
<P>
Charles is scheduled to attend a conference on international business beginning 
today in Charleston, S.C., and to travel to Washington later this week to meet 
with President Bush and British Embassy officials.

rell Waltrip became the first driver in motor sports history to surpass $10 
million in career winnings with his 14th-place finish in the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip won $49,340 in Sunday's 500-mile NASCAR Winston Cup stock car race at 
Daytona International Speedway, pushing his career winnings total to 
$10,036,481. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known since the end of last season that sometime this year I'd go over 
$10 million. It's a great feeling because that was one of my goals when I first 
started racing," the 43-year-old three-time Winston Cup champion said. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Earnhardt is second in motor sports career winnings with $9,808,903, while 
Bill Elliott is third with $9,177,639. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was no way I would ever win the most Winston Cup races of any 
driver, not with Richard Petty sitting there with so many," said Waltrip, who 
has 79 career wins to Petty's 200. "So I set my sights on being the all-time 
leading money winner in motor sports."

Reid Ryan, son of major league strikeout leader Nolan Ryan, is one of four high 
school baseball players who have chosen to attend the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, a 6-foot, 170-pound right-hander, has an 86-m.p.h. fastball, a drop-off 
from the 98-m.p.h. fastball his 43-year-old father throws, but is said to have 
a good change-up and breaking pitches. 
</P>
<P>
"People expect you to be the same as your father," Reid Ryan said. "I don't 
think I'll ever be like my dad, but I try to copy him. I'd like to pitch until 
I'm 43." 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan, with the Texas Rangers, said the Longhorns also offered him a 
scholarship when he was a high school senior in his hometown of Alvin. But he 
said his son is "overall a better athlete than me. He's developed as a pitcher. 
I just don't think he's shown as much velocity at his age."

A former UNLV basketball player says he or his ex-girlfriend made all the 
payments on a car he leased from a former university booster during his senior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Jones, now with the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA, said the booster, C. 
J. Lotter, did not help in making any of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that Lotter, during the 1985-86 season, 
made payments on the 1982 Mazda RX7 which Jones was driving. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Department of Motor Vehicle records show that the car was purchased by 
Lotter in October, 1984, and was registered in his name until May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, reached by telephone in Cleveland, said that he only had the car in his 
possession for six or seven months and that that was only after he had 
completed his senior season of eligibility in 1986. Jones said he or his former 
girlfriend made all the payments, which were $115 per month. 
</P>
<P>
If Lotter made car payments on Jones' behalf, as The Times reported, it would 
be in violation of NCAA rules.

NFL LOSES, MUST PAY $5.5 MILLION TO USFL; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SUPREME COURT LETS STAND A RULING THAT THE LEAGUE MUST PAY LEGAL FEES 
IN ANTITRUST SUIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court today refused to free the National Football League from 
having to pay more than $5.5 million in legal fees to the defunct U.S. Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the NFL must reimburse the 
USFL for attorney fees the failed league incurred in winning only $3 in a 
much-publicized antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
The USFL was formed in 1982 with 12 teams playing a spring-summer schedule. It 
collapsed in 1984 after the owners decided to switch to a fall schedule, a move 
that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
The USFL filed a $1.7-billion suit in 1984, accusing the NFL of federal 
antitrust violations in its treatment of player contracts, television coverage, 
stadium availability and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found that the NFL deliberately acquired or maintained monopoly power 
over major league professional football but ruled against the USFL on other 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
The jury awarded the USFL $1, and the presiding judge tripled that figure to $3 
in accord with antitrust law. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL claimed the lawsuit was an unsuccessful and unjust ploy to force a 
merger with the established league. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals last October upheld the award of $5.53 
million in lawyer fees to the USFL, which had sought more than $7.6 million to 
pay its attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court said, "The jury found that the NFL's monopolization of the 
United States major league professional football market injured the USFL. An 
injury having been found, the awarding of attorney's fees to the USFL was 
compulsory. 
</P>
<P>
"The award of only nominal damages to the USFL does not affect its right to 
attorney's fees." 
</P>
<P>
Allowing recovery of the fees encourages "the detection and cessation of 
anti-competitive behavior" by assuring that when lawyers prevail they will be 
paid by the losing side, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
In another ruling today, the high court refused to kill a $100-million lawsuit 
against Dade County, Fla., and developers of Joe Robbie Stadium, home of the 
Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, let stand an appeals court ruling that three 
black residents of the stadium neighborhood can pursue in federal court their 
constitutional attack against the county and developers. 
</P>
<P>
That portion of the suit revived by the appeals court alleges that the zoning 
changes made to accommodate construction of the stadium complex violated 
constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says the zoning changes represented both a "taking" of private 
property without just compensation and "a stark pattern of discriminatory 
practices affecting the property and housing rights of black citizens."

<P>
DESPITE OPPOSITION FROM POLICE AND PARISHIONERS, FATHER GREGORY BOYLE IS 
STRIVING TO END GANG VIOLENCE BY BOMBARDING YOUNG PEOPLE WITH LOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the still of a recent evening, the sobs of gang members resounded within the 
rough stucco walls of Dolores Mission Catholic Church. Bearing rosaries and 
wearing sweat shirts inscribed with the epitaph, "Rest in Peace, Trigger," more 
than 500 mourners filed into the little Boyle Heights sanctuary for the funeral 
of 17-year-old Richard Paez, shot down at a pizza parlor by a member of a rival 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Paez's Clarence Street Locos and an allied gang, TMC, listened to a 
bearded Jesuit priest preach about God's call for peace. Then they filed by the 
open casket, reaching in to give their friend a final caress or leave a 
possession -- a gang insignia belt buckle, even a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
But the funeral Mass did more than mark the year's first killing in the 
Aliso-Pico housing projects and served as a reminder of the soaring rate of 
gang-related violence in East Los Angeles. In the LAPD's Hollenbeck division, 
which has jurisdiction over the area's 400,000 residents, gang-related crime 
increased 67% from 1988 to 1989, compared to a 36% rise citywide. 
Gang-associated murders in the Hollenbeck area more than doubled -- from 10 to 
21 -- in the same period; citywide the increase was just under 18%. 
</P>
<P>
But for the priest, 36-year-old Father Gregory Boyle, the shooting was more 
than another statistic. "There's a climate of hate out there that's quite 
alarming," he says. "I'm hearing kids talking with great feeling about killing 
cops." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle hopes to allay the violence and guide gang members to a sound moral 
footing by "bombarding them with unconditional love." He has established an 
alternative school for gang youths on church grounds and invited them to join 
his parish. Addressing them as friends, he pedals his bicycle through the 
neighborhood streets every day. 
</P>
<P>
But his commitment to gang members has caused conflict with the LAPD and Capt. 
Bob Medina, a 28-year veteran of the force who took command of the Hollenbeck 
station in September. Boyle has repeatedly declined to provide police with 
information on gang members, while Medina, who believes gang violence can be 
deterred only through the use of force, accuses Boyle of refusing to fulfill 
his duty as a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Watching with mounting concern are community members, who are frightened by the 
increasingly unsafe world in which they live and uncertain if either the law or 
the church can end the violence that haunts their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle acknowledges that his work with gang members is hotly debated by both 
police and parishioners. Nonetheless, he says he will persist in the only 
strategy he believes will work, one proven successful by no less a figure than 
Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
A week after Trigger's funeral, Boyle sits in his office, a small, eclectically 
decorated room the size of a monastic cell. Sun floods through the window bars 
in geometric patches, splashing a grid of light on the Latin American artifacts 
that hang on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle wears baggy gray pants and a worn gray sweat shirt, donning his "priest's 
suit" for the most part only to officiate at Mass. As he speaks, his native 
English is colored with the melodious highs and lows of a Bolivian accent. 
</P>
<P>
After 13 years of religious training, capped by his ordination in 1984 at the 
Weston School of Theology in Boston, he spent a year working with the Indians 
in the mountains of Bolivia. It was there that he became grounded in 
"liberation theology," which takes an activist view of the Catholic Church's 
role in achieving social justice. "Having contact with the poor gave me life," 
he says. "It evangelized me." 
</P>
<P>
As a boy growing up on the fringes of Hancock Park, Boyle was preoccupied by 
basketball and his position as managing editor of the Loyola High School 
newspaper. It was a world away from his work at this, his first parish, with 
its realities of gangs, violence, drugs and dysfunctional families. 
</P>
<P>
Since his posting in the barrio, however, Boyle has dealt in activism as 
adroitly as most priests deal out Communion wafers. In December, 1986, he made 
news by declaring his church a sanctuary for undocumented workers. Three months 
later, he led a bus caravan of 250 parishioners to the Orange County home of 
regional Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Harold Ezell. He 
gave interviews to journalists and wrote opinion pieces for newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he declares, his commitment to help reform gang members has brought him 
"to the point of no return." 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, he remembers, the gangs "wouldn't give me the time of day." 
When he began walking through the projects, gang members would stare him down 
and even swear at him, an "incredible" aggression, he notes, in a Catholic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
But from the beginning, Boyle learned their names. "They said, 'Oh, my God, he 
knows my name.' They felt, 'The priest likes me.' " 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before the gang members honored him with the handle, "G-Dog," 
using the first letter of Gregory and a gang suffix. In turn, G-Dog obtained a 
bicycle and turned his walks into nightly pastoral rides, visiting each gang, 
listening to their problems and accounts of their activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1988, he began drawing gang members into the church community by 
establishing an alternative school for dropouts under the auspices of the 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
The alternative school was located on the third floor of the church's convent, 
upstairs from the Dolores Mission Catholic elementary school. Gang members 
mixed on the stairwell with small uniformed school children, and, before long, 
began hanging out at the church complex after class. 
</P>
<P>
Both parents and parishioners began to protest their presence. By last August, 
there were widespread rumors of a petition to Archbishop Roger M. Mahony 
requesting Boyle's removal from the parish, although no such petition was 
received at the archdiocese chancellery and Boyle says no one complained to him 
directly. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the unease in the community has been the growing discontent of the 
police, who believe the confidences Boyle has been gleaning from gang members 
constitute the sort of information on drug dealing and gang murders they are 
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
It is over this crucial issue that the priest draws the line between Father and 
Citizen Boyle. "I don't expect them to be priests, but often they expect me to 
be a cop," he says. "They want information from me that I would never give." 
</P>
<P>
This stance of religious immunity exasperates Medina. "Father Boyle is in a 
position where he could be extremely helpful not only to the Hollenbeck area, 
but to the entire Los Angeles Police Department. I just don't think we're 
getting the type of cooperation we should be getting." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Medina and Boyle have had two meetings, which, both men say, were 
superficially cordial but deeply frustrating. The first meeting took place last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Says Boyle of the meeting: "They said, 'You interfere with our arrests, you 
protect the kids, you give them sanctuary.' I was taken aback. I knew it wasn't 
going to be a friendly crowd, but it was downright hostile." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Medina is certain that Boyle's strategy of unconditional love 
will not work. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to pamper these people and take them by the hand. The way some of 
these people have been brought up, that would be working in their favor, that 
would make it easier for them to go out and break the law. These people 
understand only one thing and that's force. We have to enforce the laws as 
strictly as possible against many, many of these people." 
</P>
<P>
In a recreation room in the parish, outfitted with second-hand sofas and a 
television set, gang members gather one afternoon and talk about their 
relations with the police. They wear neatly pressed T-shirts and jeans, and 
speak politely, if with growing anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"They come down claiming their own gang, LAPD gang," says a 17-year-old who 
goes by the name of Speedy. "They take out a marker and they write on your 
shirt, 'LAPD Gang.' If you have any marks on your body, they do the same thing. 
They cross out your neighborhood and put 'LAPD Gang.' They just come and beat 
you down." 
</P>
<P>
A small 13-year-old called Dopey adds another story. A friend had stolen a 
bicycle and Dopey was riding on the handle bars, he says. They were stopped by 
police, and while his friend ran away, Dopey was taken to the Hollenbeck police 
station, to "the room." (Here, a ripple of understanding snickers runs around 
the sofas.) 
</P>
<P>
"They started beating me up," Dopey says. "They were hitting me with a beanie 
club. They said, 'Who is that other guy?' I said, 'I don't know who he is.' 
</P>
<P>
"They put that beanie club like choking me." Dopey gestures under his chin. "I 
say, 'Kick back, man. You're choking me.' I say, 'I pay you anything you want, 
just let me go.' He just keep on choking me. Then another cop comes and says, 
'Let him go.' " 
</P>
<P>
For Boyle, hearing tales of police brutality is common. "Every day a kid comes 
to me and says, 'We got hassled or beat down,' " the priest says. 
</P>
<P>
Medina, however, views such accounts with skepticism. "It arouses my 
competitive instinct, to put it mildly, when I have people making allegations 
without any substance to them. There isn't any evidence that any of these 
people have ever obtained medical treatment. " 
</P>
<P>
But while Boyle is meeting opposition from the law, he must also deal with 
growing agitation within the community. 
</P>
<P>
Although enrollment in the Dolores Mission elementary school has not been 
affected by the gang students upstairs, Principal Wanda Moreis says she and 
parents are concerned about their proximity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have elementary-age children, and they're fearful of the gang members," 
Moreis says. Since gang members have been there, "parents are more diligent 
about bringing kids to school and picking them up on time," and as an 
administrator "it's been a concern of mine, trying to provide more supervision 
at break time."

Moreis allows that the gang members' behavior "seems pretty restricted" and 
that they have never harassed a child, but she maintains that they pose a 
threat to the children. "They are very unpredictable. You never know what 
they're going to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to build on student self-esteem and work with the positive. The gang 
presence represents a negative." Parishioners also have expressed their 
discontent. Since gang members began hanging out around the church, attendance 
at Mass and related activities has dropped by about 10%, Boyle estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Mendoza, a member of her Neighborhood Watch committee and an active church 
member, is one of those who has reduced her participation. "I don't feel good 
about being around there much," she says. "It's dangerous. If you go to church 
you can be hurt. 'It doesn't look right. It looks like a juvenile home." 
</P>
<P>
The mixing of girls with boys is particularly worrisome, she believes. "They're 
going to start having babies there at the church. They have no respect." 
</P>
<P>
Other parishioners, however, have gradually adopted a more positive attitude 
toward gang members. "I had a derogatory image of the gangs," says church 
member Carmen Lima, who has lived in the Aliso-Pico projects for 17 years. "But 
through the work of Father Boyle, I've come to understand the vast majority of 
kids are in need of love and hope for their future. 
</P>
<P>
Lima says she has noticed changes in the behavior of gang members. "Before, you 
would walk among them and they'd give you nasty looks, like, 'How dare you walk 
where we're standing?' Now they move away nicely. Now you see them in church. 
Now you see them serve food (at church) for the homeless. This, never before!" 
</P>
<P>
Boyle is optimistic about other signs of success. School truancy within the 
projects, which was rampant when he arrived, he says, has significantly 
decreased, due to parish-led community efforts and the channeling of students 
from the church's education program back into the schools. Officials at the 
church-run school estimate a 20% reduction in the neighborhood's school 
dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle also points out that four years ago, five gangs were dealing heavily in 
drugs, whereas now drug sales are limited to only "isolated members" of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Carlos Flores, who heads Hollenbeck's Aliso-Pico Task Force, also sees 
drug-dealing as "way down." Four years ago, he says, sales took place at the 
rate of 50 every 20 minutes. Today undercover agents "are lucky if they can buy 
(drugs) once a day," an improvement he attributes to police action. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle sympathizes with Dolores school parents and children who must face "these 
guys dressed like cholos," but he stresses, "we haven't had a single problem." 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Mahony expresses support for Boyle's work. "You have to have an 
obedience to law," he says, addressing the question of discord between Boyle 
and the police. "But that in itself is not going to change the hearts and lives 
of young people. You can't just throw money and troops at problems and expect 
to find a change in peoples' behavior. What Father Boyle is doing is supplying 
the need that those kids do not have. He has my support and admiration and 
collaboration in any way I can offer it." 
</P>

Official praise notwithstanding, in the wake of the year's first killing, 
parishioners, gangs and the police are all edgy. The day of Trigger's burial, 
Boyle says he experienced a major setback. After returning from the cemetery, 
several hundred gang members were gathered at the church. "It was a wonderful, 
cathartic moment," says the priest, who, feeling the calm, briefly left the 
church on an errand. When he returned, "the place was surrounded by cops." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mourners had broken the priest's cardinal rule: They had jumped a 
member of a rival gang on church property. Furthermore, the victim was a girl 
who was being accompanied by her mother and grandmother to the church for the 
daily hand-out of bread. Girl gang members attacked her, then boys joined them. 
For two weeks, all gang members were forbidden from setting foot in the parish 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Since Trigger's death, Boyle has met a second time with Medina. "I've appealed 
to the police with the moral argument," he says. "I've appealed to them with 
the Constitutional argument in terms of harassment. None of that has worked. My 
appeal now is, please trust me, your strategy doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
Boyle is also lobbying his parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"Dolores Mission accepts gang members, we don't reject them," he told the 
congregation on a recent Sunday. "This church has flavor, tiene sabor. It has 
salt. Jesus said you are the salt of the earth and the light of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Boyle is the first to understand the enormousness of the task he has 
undertaken and sometimes feels a sense of desperation. "I feel it every time 
there's some violence," he says. "I know I can only do as much as I can do." 
</P>
<P>
And what he can do is believe in his course of unconditional love. "The point 
is, what is the strategy Jesus would have us adopt? 
</P>
<P>
"I want us to be prophetic on the issue of gangs. I want Dolores Mission to be 
the light." 
</P>

member. "There's a climate of hate out there that's quite alarming," Boyle 
says. He is combatting that hate by offering gang members "unconditional love."
