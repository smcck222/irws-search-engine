U.S. ILLEGALLY DENIED POOR CHILDREN AID; 
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT: THE JUSTICES FIND ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES FOR DISABLED YOUNGSTERS 
ARE UNFAIR. THE RULING COULD AFFECT TENS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

<P>
The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the government has wrongly denied monthly 
benefits and free medical care to poor disabled children by imposing stringent, 
unfair guidelines for eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling could affect tens or even hundreds of thousands of low-income 
handicapped children denied Social Security benefits over the last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ordered federal officials to individually evaluate children to 
see if they are disabled rather than rely on a list of disabling conditions, as 
they have done since 1974, when children were first made eligible for the 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Although children could qualify for benefits even if their disabilities were 
not on the list, they were less likely to receive benefits if the impairments 
were not specifically mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
The government list includes dozens of afflictions, including cerebral palsy, 
epilepsy and acute leukemia, but it does not include such well-known childhood 
impairments as spina bifida, Down's syndrome, muscular dystrophy, autism, AIDS 
and fetal alcohol syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
The class-action suit was filed on behalf of 11-year-old Brian Zebley, who 
suffered brain damage at birth. He has eye problems, motor skills difficulties, 
is partly paralyzed and retarded. He received benefits for two years, until 
surgery enabled him to walk better. But in 1982 his benefits were cut off 
because he "no longer met or equaled the requirements" set forth in the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"This program has been illegally administered for over 15 years," said Jonathan 
Stein, a Philadelphia lawyer who in 1983 filed the class-action suit that 
resulted in Tuesday's ruling. "This will open up benefits and free medical care 
to tens of thousands, and maybe hundreds of thousands, of poor kids who are 
disabled." 
</P>
<P>
The $12-billion-a-year Supplemental Security Income program provides extra 
income for poor persons who are over 65, blind or disabled. Beginning in 1974, 
Conbgress made poor disabled children eligible for the same benefits as adults 
if their mental or physical impairments were of "comparable severity" to a 
disability that would prevent an adult from "any substantial gainful activity." 
</P>
<P>
In response, federal regulators drew up a list of disabling impairments but 
ignored a number that are common only among children, the high court noted. In 
addition, the regulations made it easier for adults to qualify because, even 
without an impairment that was totally disabling, an adult could still show 
that he or she could not hold a job. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, Social Security officials have rejected about half of the average 
100,000 claims filed on behalf of children. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for a 7-2 majority, said that the 
government's "approach to child disability is manifestly contrary to the 
statute" enacted by Congress and is therefore illegal. Only Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White sided with government attorneys 
in the case (Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, vs. Zebley, 
88-1377). 
</P>
<P>
Neither lawyers involved in the case nor Social Security officials could 
estimate how much the ruling will cost the government. This year, about 265,000 
children are getting benefits under the program at an annual cost of nearly $1 
billion, Social Security officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Studies have estimated that as many as 1 million children nationwide are 
impaired and living in low-income families, suggesting a greatly increased 
government liability. Social Security officials concede that some severely 
disabled children have fallen through the cracks but contend that there has 
been no wholesale denial of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The court did not specify whether the government must reopen claims from 
previous years. Because the nationwide class-action suit was filed in 1983, 
Justice Department lawyers conceded that they would have to reopen claims 
denied since then. But Stein, the Philadelphia attorney, said that he would 
seek to have claims reopened back to 1974, when the program began. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Holle, a child advocacy attorney with Protection and Advocacy Inc. in 
Glendale, Calif., said that the rigid federal regulations have discouraged many 
parents with disabled children from applying for benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules were so restrictive and rigid that a lot of parents decided it was 
futile. It was particularly bad for infants and toddlers because their 
conditions often did not fit the list," Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the program provides a maximum monthly benefit of $499 for a 
disabled child. More important, children who qualify become eligible for 
Medicaid or MediCal benefits. 
</P>
<P>
A couple with a single disabled child may have a monthly income as high as 
$1,762 and still qualify for some benefits, Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can apply for benefits at a local office of the Social Security 
Administration. "I also urge parents to talk to a social worker at the 
hospital, because they can help with the records," Holle said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a second ruling designed to protect children, the court said that 
parents suspected of abusing a child may be jailed for contempt if they refuse 
to obey a court order to disclose the child's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-2 ruling neatly disposes of a dilemma raised by a Baltimore mother's case 
but did so in an apparently narrow way. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Bouknight, a Baltimore woman whose young child, Maurice, had 
suffered broken bones and bruises in his first months of life, briefly lost 
custody of her child in 1986. But a juvenile court judge gave Bouknight custody 
again on the promise that she would improve her behavior and allow regular 
visits by child-care workers. 
</P>
<P>
She did neither, and in 1987 the child was reported missing by child-care 
workers, who suspected he was dead. But, when brought back before the judge, 
Bouknight invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and 
refused to disclose the whereabouts of Maurice. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said that Bouknight may not 
invoke the Fifth Amendment because she was under a juvenile court order. This 
was primarily a civil regulatory matter, not a criminal one, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, the court has adopted this approach to narrow the reach of the 
Fourth and Fifth amendments. For example, officials may search persons at 
airports or at the U.S. borders without search warrants, the court has said, 
because these are primarily regulatory searches, not criminal ones. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the court has said that corporate officers may not invoke the Fifth 
Amendment and refuse to turn over potentially incriminating documents, again 
because this is considered a regulatory matter. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the court upheld a California law requiring motorists involved in 
accidents to supply their names and addresses, even if this information could 
prove incriminating. 
</P>
<P>
Citing these rulings, O'Connor described the juvenile courts as a "broadly 
directed, noncriminal regulatory regime" designed to protect children, not 
prosecute crimes. But O'Connor added that Bouknight, who has remained in a 
Baltimore jail, could seek immunity from prosecution for whatever information 
she provides. Maurice was last reported seen nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. said that 
forcing a suspect to disclose the whereabouts of a dead body certainly could 
prove incriminating and, therefore, should be covered by the Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's ruling in the case (Baltimore vs. Bouknight, 88-1182) has no effect 
on the much publicized two-year-long jailing of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan in the 
District of Columbia. Morgan hid her daughter rather than allow court-ordered 
visitations with the father. Morgan alleged that the father had sexually abused 
the child. She was held in jail on civil contempt charges and could not invoke 
the Fifth Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Let stand an appeals court ruling that government social workers are immune 
from suit for placing children in foster homes. Three children who were placed 
with an uncle in Washington state and were later sexually abused filed suit 
against the caseworker. But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based in San 
Francisco said these workers, like court employees, are immune from liability 
for their official actions if the child-placement decisions are approved by a 
court (Babcock vs. Tyler, 89-912). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dismissed a damage suit against the federal government filed by the widow 
of Navy Capt. Michael J. Smith, one of seven crew members who died in the 1986 
explosion of the Challenger space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the other six, all civilians, accepted settlements from the 
government. But Smith's widow was not made a similar offer because, under a 
court doctrine that is still the subject of dispute, civilians may sue the 
government for damages but servicemen and their survivors may not. The claim by 
Smith's widow, Jane, was rejected by two lower courts, and the justices refused 
to reopen the issue (Smith vs. U.S., 89-607). 
</P>
<P>
POLICE POWER BOLSTERED -- The high court upheld a ruling that allows police to 
stop and question a person. A3

RESCUERS WORKED FRANTICALLY AS VICTIMS SLIPPED UNDER ICE

CONVICT LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescuer Cris Baitx, using first his fists, then his head, had twice punched his 
way out of the ice on Convict Lake and was going under for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
Panicked, he was drifting in and out of consciousness in the frigid waters 
where three teen-age boys had already disappeared and four other men struggled 
to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure I was gone," Baitx told The Times on Tuesday. "I was thinking of my 
wife and kids and are they going to be OK, because I'm history." 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong. Baitx survived after a dramatic rescue that punctuated an 
otherwise grim drama on Convict Lake, in which seven people drowned. 
</P>
<P>
What began as a frantic effort to save three drowning youths and their two 
counselors deteriorated into a perilous struggle by rescuers to save each 
other. In interviews with volunteers who participated and with eyewitnesses, 
the following account of Monday's events emerged: 
</P>
<P>
The first word of trouble came about noon on Monday. A group of 12 teen-agers 
from the area's Camp O'Neal, a residential facility for troubled youth, along 
with two of their counselors, were on a holiday outing at the lake. Hiking 
across thin ice, at least four teen-agers and both adults fell into the water. 
</P>
<P>
Frightened youngsters rushed to the nearby home of Clay Cutter, an employee of 
the U.S. Forest Service. They pounded on Cutter's door, crying for help. Cutter 
instructed his wife to call 911, and he rushed to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids were hysterical," said a 31-year-old maintenance worker from the 
Convict Lake resort who witnessed the tragedy. "Their friends were under there. 
They saw them dying." 
</P>
<P>
Steadily but carefully, Cutter made his way on hands and knees toward the 
center of the lake. One unidentified teen-ager had pulled himself out but the 
other three youngsters had apparently already drowned; they were no longer in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
Cutter was able to reach the two counselors, closer in -- their heads bobbing, 
their arms thrashing. Perched precariously on the edge of the ice, he managed 
to put a rope around each man while talking to them continuously to keep them 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, summoned by their beepers, members of the Long Valley Volunteer Fire 
Department hurried down a winding road, past tall snowdrifts, to the lake. 
Cutter and some of the other teen-agers in the outing were on the dangerously 
thin ice; a small crowd was starting to line the lake shore. 
</P>
<P>
The rescuers had been thrust into a crisis for which they were ill-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
Baitx, who is chief of the Fire Department, and Ray Turner, a captain, grabbed 
an aluminum flat-bottom boat and pushed it out over the ice. Suddenly, the ice 
broke under Turner and he fell into the water. Baitx pulled Turner back into 
the boat. 
</P>
<P>
With a metal ladder stretched out in front of him like a sled, Baitx edged 
himself slowly out over the ice toward the victims. He reached one of the 
counselors, known to the rescuers as "Grandpa," and started to hoist the man to 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the ice collapsed beneath them and Baitx fell into the water 
alongside Grandpa. Baitx, recalling the accident Tuesday from his home in 
Mammoth Lakes, said he found himself trapped under ice and tangled in the 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
At this moment, volunteer fireman Vidar Anderson reached the lake and, using 
two ladders for better weight distribution -- one lengthwise on each side of 
his body -- shimmied on hands and knees toward where Baitx had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson grabbed Baitx -- but the ice cracked again and both men plunged into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point, I went down again," Baitx recalled. "I head-butted the ice and 
busted through." 
</P>
<P>
Baitx would go down a third time before being rescued; Anderson, 58, would not 
be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
Cutter, too, was having difficulties. As he struggled to assist the counselors, 
he had slipped and fallen into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"We would see a head above water, then you didn't see that head," said one of a 
score of horrified spectators -- including Cutter's wife -- who watched the 
operations from the lake shore. "There would be two heads, then one. Then no 
one. You knew what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
By this time, Russ Veenker, a diver for the June Lake Mountain Rescue Team, had 
arrived. He saw the three men at the opening in the lake where the counselors 
had fallen, about 450 feet from shore. Pulling a rubber raft behind him, he 
delicately walked onto the ice, past where Turner sat in the flatboat. 
</P>
<P>
The ice cracked under Veenker's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty feet from shore, Veenker lay prone on the fracturing ice and pulled 
himself along a rope that had been stretched from a dozen volunteer rescuers on 
the shore to the ladder in which Baitx had become entangled. 
</P>
<P>
Veenker said he then felt the rope being tugged toward shore by the rescuers 
lining the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Halfway there, I heard panic, commotion and yelling, and felt the rope being 
pulled toward shore," Veenker said. "I knew the whole thing was going wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Veenker, alarmed, saw Baitx being pulled under the ice toward him, his face 
scraping against the ice. Two other men seemed to be swimming behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Then one was suddenly gone," Veenker said. "The other guy was bobbing up and 
down and gasping, six feet way from me. I exhorted him to come toward me. He 
bobbed five or six times, then he went down." 
</P>
<P>
Veenker dived under the surface of the water to try to untangle Baitx from the 
ladder but he failed. He swam under Baitx, put him on top of his chest and 
tried to calm him. Baitx was suffering from hypothermia and was blacking out. 
</P>
<P>
"His arms were useless," Veenker said, adding that he could not free Baitx from 
the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"I prayed at that point. I had no way to free him." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, two more rescuers then approached in a second rubber raft, and they 
were able to free Baitx from the ladder. 
</P>
<P>
But it was too late for Cutter, Anderson and the two counselors. They had lost 
the battle to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
"They kind of lost (Cutter) right at the last," said Remington Slifka, general 
manager for the Convict Lake resort, who watched the futile rescue. "The diver 
said he thought he had him, that he really tried to hang on, but he was gone."

CONVICT LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rescue teams pulled the first of seven bodies from the frigid waters of this 
eastern Sierra Nevada fishing lake Tuesday, as friends of the drowning victims 
kept vigil at lakeside and counselors moved in to assist survivors at a youth 
camp that lost three students and two adult employees in a holiday tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, divers clad in bright blue insulated suits probed under a 
shroud of ice for the bodies of the victims, who had not been seen since they 
slipped beneath the lake's surface shortly after noon Monday. Other rescue 
workers manned helicopters and a special air-propelled boat that skimmed over 
the treacherously thin surface. 
</P>
<P>
The search was called off at dusk and will resume at 8 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
The body discovered was that of U.S. Forest Service employee Clay Cutter, whose 
wife, Terry, had watched as her husband ran across the frozen lake to try to 
aid three floundering teen-agers -- only to be trapped himself when the ice 
collapsed. Another three would-be rescuers also drowned. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Cutters' lake-front home Tuesday, friends sobbed as rescue workers 
lifted the body into the airboat and enclosed it in a yellow bag. Cutter's body 
was recovered after rescue divers found a rope floating on the lake. They 
pulled at the line, and found Cutter at the end, according to one rescuer, Lt. 
Glenn Barnes of the Washoe County, Nev., Sheriff's Department. Cutter's hand, 
he said, was still tightly clasping the nylon rope. 
</P>
<P>
As delicate recovery work proceeded on the ice, California Air National Guard 
crews combed the perimeter of the lake. Officials said they were responding to 
statements by witnesses who said they saw one of the seven victims make it to 
shore. But no evidence was found of a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
"We searched the perimeter real thoroughly and we didn't see anything," said 
Maj. Steve Hussey, who is attached to the reserves at Moffet Naval Air Station 
near San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation into the deaths deepened, speculation centered on whether 
the youngsters were properly supervised on the holiday hiking trip. It was not 
yet known, authorities said, whether the counselors who died trying to save the 
teen-agers had been out on the ice with them, or had run onto the ice only when 
they saw trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Local residents said Convict Lake is known to be dangerous in winter. Its ice 
frequently melts and refreezes, making its thickness and safety suspect, 
residents said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the things we're trying to find out: How much supervision did they 
have? Were they out on the ice alone? How many were out on the ice at one 
time?" said Mono County Sheriff's Investigator John Rutkowski. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of Camp O'Neal, the private residential treatment center 
where the teen-agers lived, said the outing included half of the 34 students 
who lived there, as well as some supervisors. One of the supervisors was an 
"experienced back-country guide," said Bobbi Trott, the executive director. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Trott repeatedly sidestepped questions about the conduct 
of her staff. "We're relying on the sheriffs to do their investigation," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was meant as "a holiday outing, a fun time for kids," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's office and other agencies, meanwhile, began releasing the names 
of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy, among the worst drowning incidents in the nation in at least a 
decade, began at noon Monday when the hiking teen-agers ventured out onto the 
newly frozen surface. The camp, which is located across U.S. 395 from Convict 
Lake, handles troubled youths ages 12 to 18 from several counties. 
</P>
<P>
As they played on the ice, four of them suddenly fell through. One managed to 
clamber out but three were trapped in the frigid water. Authorities identified 
the dead youngsters as David C. Sellers, 15, of Tulare County and Shawn Diaz, 
15 of Dinuba, and an unnamed 13-year-old from Redlands. The 16-year-old who 
escaped the frigid lake was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mono County Sheriff-Coroner Martin Strelneck identified two of the 
adult victims, Dave Meyers and Randy Porter, as camp counselors who had tried 
to rescue the teen-agers. The other victims were two would-be rescuers -- 
volunteer fireman Vidar Anderson, 58, of Sunnyslope and Cutter, a 31-year-old 
U.S. Forest Service employee. 
</P>
<P>
Another volunteer firefighter who survived several minutes in the frigid water 
was released Tuesday from Centinela Mammoth Hospital in Mammoth Lakes, about 
five miles north of here. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his release, Cris Baitx told The Times that he had to punch 
through the ice three times to grab breaths of air as rescuers crept toward 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad scene and it just kept getting worse," he said. Baitx, part of a 
volunteer force that arrived well before better-equipped rescuers, said he felt 
he had to reach out to the struggling youths and counselors despite the risk. 
</P>
<P>
"Just watching these heads bobbing up and down was too much," Baitx said. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured we should have waited for the rescue team. But when people are 
bobbing up and down, you know what's next." 
</P>
<P>
The search for victims had been called off at dusk Monday because of fears that 
more would be lost to the lake. But at 7 a.m. Tuesday, new rescue teams began 
converging on the Mammoth Lakes sheriff's substation. Within two hours, a 
helicopter from the China Lake Naval Weapons Station was circling the lake, 
pinpointing with buoys the holes where the victims had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The airboat from the Truckee Fire District and a special diving team from 
Washoe County then moved onto the ice, recovering the first body by 11 a.m. and 
searching throughout the day for others. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff-Coroner Strelneck said the chances of finding all of the bodies are 
slim, given the lake's depth and the dangerous conditions. As if to emphasize 
that, the skies, clear and wind-free at dawn, had clouded over by noon. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will be a very difficult operation," Strelneck said. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions remained treacherous and the progress frustratingly slow all day 
Tuesday. Divers were limited to 15 minutes in the icy water because of the cold 
and the effects of the high altitude. 
</P>
<P>
The first of five crews to dive under the ice Tuesday was forced to return to 
the surface after only six minutes, when the air regulators on their diving 
equipment froze. The malfunction sent compressed air streaming from the tanks, 
endangering the divers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down for about six minutes and it will be three hours before I'm able to 
dive again," said Carl Barrett of the Washoe County sheriff's diving team. 
Divers were forced to stay out of the water after each dive until their blood 
gases returned to normal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett and his partner were diving in about 77 feet of water near where the 
adult rescue workers were believed to have fallen through the ice, he said. 
Visibility was 12 to 15 feet, but Barrett said no bodies were visible. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing but sand, nothing," he said when asked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
Divers were sent down in teams of two from a rubber boat, which carried other 
diving team members who monitored the safety of their colleagues. During the 
attempts Tuesday, divers began at the points where the adult victims were 
believed to have fallen, and slowly worked their way outward in a circular 
pattern. They have not yet searched the deeper area where the teen-agers were 
last seen. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said they believe the bodies may have sunk to the bottom of 
the lake, which is up to 140 feet deep. Because of its equipment, the Washoe 
County team is able to dive only to depths of about 80 feet. Late Tuesday, 
officials here sent for the Los Angeles County sheriff's rescue team, whose 
equipment allows dives of up to 300 feet. The team was scheduled to depart Los 
Angeles on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of convinced that they're not in this shallower part, that they're 
going to be found in deeper water," said Glen Vogler, chief deputy of the 
Washoe County sheriff's team. 
</P>
<P>
Skaters and hikers often test the frozen lake, as the camp youths apparently 
did on Monday, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"People do that and get away with it quite often," said Mono County Sheriff's 
Lt. Terry Padilla. 
</P>
<P>
In the close-knit Sierra community, the impact of the deaths hit home Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The town is in shock right now," said Mammoth Lakes town manager Paul 
Marangella. "This accident has touched everyone. . . . Most of us know each 
other. Any kind of tragedy like this has a tremendous effect." 
</P>
<P>
At Camp O'Neal, a spokesman said residents and counselors were undergoing 
therapy Tuesday with specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very devastated," said Almeda De Cell, a clinical psychologist 
counseling the youths. 
</P>
<P>
Mono County Sheriff's Investigator John Daniels, who interviewed some of the 
teen-agers who had been on the lake, said they displayed a wide range of 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Some adopted a tough, stoic posture and appeared to be "hardened young boys," 
Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Others took the tragedy harder, Daniels said. "Some had lost their best 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
Among friends and relatives of the other victims, grief was slightly more 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Cutter worked as a snow ranger for the U.S. Forest Service during the winter; 
in the summer he was a Forest Service firefighter. His supervisor, Dean 
McAlister, said Tuesday that Cutter had rescued people from the lake before, 
but never under icy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, friends said, youngsters had banged on his door to warn him that 
people had fallen through the ice. He left his house with the black-and-red 
rope he had used on earlier rescues, the same rope that would lead to the 
discovery of his body. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Terry, had run to the shore and watched through binoculars Monday 
afternoon as her husband struggled to rescue the victims. As his body was 
pulled from the lake Tuesday, she remained in seclusion in the couple's home. A 
group of friends kept reporters away from the family, which includes three 
young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hard to believe, especially when it's someone you know, someone you 
worked with," said Tim McMullen, a fire management officer for the Inyo 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of the other adult rescuer, volunteer firefighter Anderson, also 
rallied around his family. Anderson, a retired school bus driver, lived in 
nearby Sunnyslope with his wife, daughter and granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Few knew the identities of the victims Monday night, but when the names of the 
dead were released Tuesday, the shock broadened. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in town lost a friend in this thing," said Remington Slifka, general 
manager of the Convict Lake Resort. "It will be hard for the town to recover. 
This lake is very special . . . it will be very hard to think of the lake in 
those terms again." 
</P>
<P>
Slifka and others said the lake's dangers should have been well known. Convict 
Lake is fickle, they said. A week ago it was frozen over, but this past 
Saturday most of the ice was gone. It did not freeze again until Sunday night, 
Slifka said. 
</P>
<P>
"Convict Lake is famous for being water one day, ice the next day," said 
Slifka. " . . . All of the locals know this." 
</P>
<P>
But Marsha Reiten, a friend of the Cutter family, reminded others that the 
teen-age victims were from outside the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Every parent ought to keep their kids off of ice," she said. "Don't let your 
kids on ice." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Sheryl Stolberg in Convict Lake and researcher Tracy Thomas 
contributed to this story.

Californians dreaming of a possible record jackpot of $62 million or more 
grabbed lotto tickets at the stunning rate Tuesday of up to 525 each second -- 
15 times normal, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Accountant Paul Littleton, 43, of San Francisco, was among those gambling only 
because of the size of the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I do when I read about the big money is get a ticket. It's 
just like I feel I can't miss my chance," said Littleton, who bought 10 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Store clerks were startled at the pace of $1 ticket sales, which California 
Lottery officials said already has set records. 
</P>
<P>
Current estimates are that the Lotto 6/49 winner who picks the six numbers out 
of 49 that match those drawn on television at 7:58 tonight will receive nearly 
$2.5 million a year, after taxes. If there are multiple winners, the jackpot 
will be divided among them. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery director Chon Gutierrez said the prize may exceed California's record 
jackpot of $61.98 million on Oct. 29, 1988, but the official estimate remained 
$60 million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The jackpot ranks fourth in the nation, trailing a record $115-million lottery 
prize in Pennsylvania last year.

RED CROSS PLANS WIDER SPENDING FOR QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>

The Red Cross promised Tuesday to spend the entire $52.5 million donated for 
earthquake relief in Northern California, after recent public criticism from 
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos over its plans to use the money for future 
disasters elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to take some action to re-establish good faith with our donors, to 
keep the trust and confidence with them," said Barbara Lohman, a spokesman for 
the American Red Cross regional office in Burlingame. 
</P>
<P>
The 109-year-old, nonprofit international relief organization has spent $12.1 
million on emergency relief for the 100-mile stretch of Northern California 
devastated by the 7.1-magnitude quake on Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
The agency had promised to spend only another $10 million on long-term 
rebuilding programs, contending there had not been a demonstrated need for 
using the rest of the money here. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos, just one of the area's mayors applying for funds, had sought at least 
$10 million from the Red Cross, much of it to meet the needs of homeless 
people, some of whom were ousted from the hotels that serve as the city's 
emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Cross officials had suggested most of the remaining $30.4 million 
donated to the Northern California Earthquake Relief Fund could end up in a 
general disaster account administered in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Agnos had chided the Red Cross for considering taking that money out of 
Northern California, which sustained from $7 billion to $10 billion in damage 
from the largest quake here since the 1906 Great Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of public speeches, Agnos charged the agency with having a 
"horse-and-buggy kind of philosophy. They come into town and provide tents, 
blankets, coffee and doughnuts." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday, Agnos said the Red Cross' decision would "keep 
the faith" of people from around the world who donated to the earthquake relief 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of unmet needs here. . . . We've been saying spend this money on 
those who need it rather than putting it in the bank for the next disaster," 
the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
The $12 million the Red Cross already has spent has gone to supply food, 
clothing, emergency rents and medical aid, Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
Several million dollars worth of other supplies also have been provided by the 
Red Cross and will have to be paid for from the relief fund, Lohman added. 
</P>
<P>
After the quake, the Red Cross set up 45 shelters, helping more than 14,000 
families and providing 500,000 meals. The Red Cross still operates two 
shelters, one each in Oakland and San Francisco that serve a total of about 400 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The decision not to transfer earthquake funds out of the region was made over 
the weekend after discussions between George F. Moody, national chairman of the 
Red Cross, and the agency's executive committee of its Board of Governors, a 
volunteer group that oversees Red Cross operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The foremost reason is that this earthquake was not the last disaster that's 
going to hit here, and in hopes of maintaining the integrity of our donations 
process to meet the needs of the bigger (future) quake, which we all know is 
coming, we decided we needed to do this," Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the Red Cross does not have a policy requiring it to use all 
donations designated for a specific disaster in those programs. 
</P>
<P>
The extra $30 million will be used to fund proposals already submitted by 
officials of the quake-stricken areas, including the cities of San Francisco, 
Santa Cruz, Watsonville and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Those funding requests were to be paid for with the $10 million set aside, 
which turned out to represent only a fraction of the total requested. 
</P>
<P>
The allocations will be announced in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
Moody said any remaining money would be placed in a special account designated 
for future earthquake relief and preparedness in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
That could be used for such things as emergency response vehicles, stockpiling 
emergency equipment like generators and supplies, and quake education and 
survival training. 
</P>
<P>
"It is and always has been Red Cross policy to stay on the job in a disaster 
until the job is done and all victims are cared for," Moody said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the Northern California earthquake, an unprecedented outpouring 
of generosity by people all over the country may make it possible for us to go 
even further to help prepare Northern Californians for any future disasters."

COURT AFFIRMS POLICE POWER TO DEMAND ID; 
</P>
<P>
RIGHTS: MANY LEGAL EXPERTS CONTEND THAT THE RULING ILLUSTRATES A WHITTLING AWAY 
OF THE 4TH AMENDMENT'S BAN ON UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES.

<P>
A person stopped on the street by police, questioned and ordered to produce 
identification has not been seized but is merely engaged in a "consensual 
encounter," according to an Orange County ruling left standing Tuesday by the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The high court dismissed without comment or dissent an appeal of a ruling by a 
state Court of Appeal in Orange County upholding the October, 1986, arrest for 
cocaine possession of Servando Lopez on a Santa Ana street. 
</P>
<P>
Many defense lawyers and even some judges contend that the Court of Appeal 
ruling, which has a binding effect throughout the state, illustrates a 
whittling away of the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and 
seizures in response to the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, the Orange County appeals court judge who wrote the 
opinion upholding Lopez's arrest said he disagreed with his own decision but 
felt compelled to rule as he did because of recent Supreme Court precedents. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Supreme Court said police can briefly question someone on the 
street if they have reason to believe that the person is engaged in wrongdoing. 
But, the court added, officers cannot detain or arrest the suspect without firm 
evidence, or probable cause, that he has committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, several court rulings in drug and immigration cases have 
undercut the doctrine, suggesting instead that the police may stop, detain and 
question a person even if they have no evidence of illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 22, 1986, two Santa Ana officers on midday patrol spotted Lopez sitting 
on the hood of a car in a downtown area known for drug trafficking. Stopping 
their patrol car, they walked up to the man and began questioning him. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he was waiting for a few friends to play pool. Dissatisfied with 
that and other answers to their questions, the officers asked to see his 
identification. When Lopez pulled out his wallet, the officers found a small 
amount of cocaine inside and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan threw out the evidence 
against Lopez, ruling that he had been unconstitutionally "seized" by officers 
who had no reason to believe that he had done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But last July, a three-judge appeals panel in Santa Ana overturned that ruling 
and reinstated the charges against Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Their decision relied on Supreme Court rulings in 1983, 1984 and 1988 that said 
police or immigration officers can question a presumably innocent person as 
long as the person understands that he is "free to leave" at any time. These 
rulings "compel the conclusion that no seizure occurred here," Court of Appeal 
Judge Thomas Crosby said in the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby conceded, however, that the trial judge had been correct from a 
practical standpoint, if not under the law. 
</P>
<P>
"In the real world, this defendant (Lopez) could not possibly have felt himself 
free to walk away when his identification was requested, and it is almost 
laughable to think the officers would have let him do so," Crosby wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he continued, "a solid majority of the U.S. Supreme Court is of 
the view that ordinary citizens and even undocumented aliens confronted by 
immigration officials would be aware that they could merely saunter off when 
asked to identify themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Public Defender Ronald Klar appealed the Lopez decision to 
the California Supreme Court, which rejected it in August. In December, he 
filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in Lopez vs. California, 89-959. 
</P>
<P>
"The message sent out by the California Court of Appeal," Klar said, "is that, 
without arousing any reasonable suspicion whatsoever, a law-abiding citizen may 
be approached by armed police officers in a public place, surrounded so that 
his path is obstructed, asked accusatory questions, continued to be questioned 
after he has chosen not to respond and requested (to) produce identification, 
all without the protection of the Fourth Amendment."

RESCUER'S DEATH IS DARK DAY FOR SUNNYSLOPE

<P>
Most of his friends figured he would die a hero, because when disaster erupted 
in the eastern Sierra Nevada, Vidar Anderson was almost always there. 
</P>
<P>
Forest fires, plane crashes, mountain rescues -- these were like a call to arms 
for Anderson, 58, a volunteer member of the Long Valley Fire Department. Tall 
and wiry, the retired school bus driver would invariably be the first on the 
scene. He was aggressive, friends and colleagues said, selfless, and ever calm 
in the face of danger. 
</P>
<P>
"He was fearless," Ray Turner, a fellow firefighter, recalled Tuesday as he sat 
in the local fire station, weary, grimy and subdued. "He would risk his life in 
a minute." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Anderson met his match on the treacherous, frozen surface of Convict 
Lake. As he struggled to reach others drowning in the frigid waters, Anderson 
crashed through the ice, slipping into the dark of the mountain lake. 
</P>
<P>
A diver from the June Lake search and rescue team managed to slide a rubber 
boat across the ice and save another would-be rescuer, Cris Baitx, but Anderson 
had dropped from sight before he could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
News of his death struck like a painful spasm in Sunnyslope, a small community 
just south of Mammoth Lakes where Anderson lived with his wife and one of his 
two daughters, and in neighboring towns. The loss of this beloved man -- 
described as the "classic good Samaritan" by one friend -- seemed unfathomable. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn, I hate to hear this," said Ed Cereda as he brushed back tears and kicked 
a boulder of ice outside the general store he manages in Tom's Place, a tiny 
town along U.S. 395. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only so many of those kind of guys around," Turner said. "Maybe he 
was the only one we had. Now we've lost him. It's a hell of a loss." 
</P>
<P>
A former Encino resident, Anderson moved with his wife, Ruth, and daughters to 
the Mammoth Lakes area in 1980. The region was ideal for Anderson, an avid 
hunter and outdoorsman. The family settled in Sunnyslope, where Anderson built 
a two-story house and landed a job driving buses for a local school district. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson -- whose lean face was distinguished by what one friend described as 
"permanent smile lines" -- became a familiar figure around town. He was the 
type who loved to stop and chat. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always out and around," recalled Paul Burns, a deputy with the Mono 
County Sheriff's Department. "You'd talk to him at the doughnut shop, at fire 
scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's reputation for selflessness was well-known. After a hunting trip, he 
would share whatever meat he brought back with local nursing homes and needy 
families, friends recalled. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Anderson joined the volunteer fire department, and he proved to be a 
gung-ho member. He typically beat everyone else to a disaster scene -- 
including a fiery plane crash that killed three people last month -- and often 
took a lead role in risky rescue operations. After retiring recently from the 
school district, his work with the fire department increased. 
</P>
<P>
"Either he or I was always the first on the scene of an accident," Burns said. 
Another friend recalled that Anderson "always liked to be the guy on the 
nozzle" of a fire hose. 
</P>
<P>
As divers prowled beneath the ice on a grisly search for Anderson's body 
Tuesday, friends acknowledged that they often feared he would lose his life 
while seeking to save another. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the kind of guy we ever thought was going to die in a nursing home 
of old age," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, Tina Anderson, 38, agreed. And, despite her grief, she said she 
is proud of all her father accomplished. "I'm glad he died a hero," she said. 
</P>

ALLEN RIVKIN; CO-FOUNDER OF WRITERS GUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allen Rivkin, a one-time electrician who became a screenwriter and then helped 
found the Writers Guild of America, has died at age 86, the guild announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkin died Saturday of kidney failure at his West Hollywood home, said a 
Writers Guild of America spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran writer and unionist had been ill for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Rivkin wrote more than 70 screenplays, including "Dancing Lady" (Fred Astaire's 
first film, which starred Joan Crawford), "The Picture Snatcher" with James 
Cagney, "Till the End of Time," "The Farmer's Daughter" (an Academy Award for 
Loretta Young in 1947), "Grounds for Marriage" and "Prisoners of War," starring 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1933, Rivkin and nine other writers were elected to the first board of 
directors of the newly formed Screen Writers Guild, the precursor to today's 
Writers Guild of America, with branches on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
He helped the fledgling guild overcome the challenge by the studio-backed 
Screen Playwrights Inc., a fight that ended with the screen writers victorious 
in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he served on 35 guild committees, founded and edited its 
newsletter and was the director of public relations from 1963 to 1986. He 
played a key role during the congressional hearings into Communist infiltration 
of the film industry, organizing a slate of centrist and conservative 
candidates for guild seats. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, Rivkin wrote and produced documentaries for the highly 
prized "Why We Fight" series of War Department films. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Hayward, Wis., Rivkin studied journalism at the University of Minnesota 
and worked as a reporter before moving to Hollywood in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
He did movie studio electrical work before becoming a publicist for RKO. 
</P>
<P>
His writing career took off in the 1930s when he collaborated with Ben Markson 
on the stage play "Is My Face Red," which became a 1932 movie. 
</P>
<P>
His credits also include nine television scripts. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held March 2 at 11:30 p.m. at the Writers Guild 
Theater, 135 S. Doheny Drive, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife and writing partner, Laura Kerr, a daughter, three 
grandchildren, a sister-in-law and two nephews.

ERIK RHODES, 84; COMEDIAN, ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erik Rhodes, the comedian and character actor known to millions of film fans 
for his portrayals of suave Continental gigolos in many pictures, among them 
two with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, has died in his home state of 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, also a veteran of the Broadway musical stage and radio, was 84 when he 
died Saturday in a nursing home in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
He became part of the national scene in 1933 when he created the role of 
Rudolfo Tonetti, the excitable Italian co-respondent in the Broadway play "The 
Gay Divorcee." It became an early Astaire-Rogers film with Rhodes re-creating 
his role as the hired co-respondent. His motto -- "Your wife is safe with 
Tonetti, he prefers spaghetti" -- moved into the jargon of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes portrayed another passionate Latin, Alberto Berdini, in the 
Astaire-Rogers feature "Top Hat" and from there moved into several secondary 
features of the day including "Charlie Chan in Paris," "A Night at the Ritz," 
"Nitwits," "Old Man Rhythm," "Chatterbox," "Music for Madame" and more. 
</P>

His last film in 1939 was "On Your Toes," the recently revived Broadway 
musical.

Rhodes was born Earnest Sharpe and attended the University of Oklahoma where he 
studied French, Italian and German and won a scholarship to study drama in New 
York. He also was a capable baritone and slipped easily into musicals of the 
day, commonly playing the effete playboy that became his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
After serving in the Army Air Force intelligence service during World War II as 
a language specialist, he did some early television work, most notably with 
Gloria Swanson in a variety show called "Wonder Boy." He returned to Broadway 
in the 1950s and was featured in Cole Porter's "Can Can."

His wife died in 1984 and there are no immediate survivors.

H. BRANDON; VETERAN ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Henry Brandon, a character actor who portrayed the villainous Squire Cribbs in 
Los Angeles' longest-running stage production, "The Drunkard," fierce Indian 
chiefs for John Ford and a foil for Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, has died in 
his Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran of more than 100 films and dozens of stage productions was 77 when 
he died Thursday of an apparent heart attack. His agent, Gary Butcher, said 
Brandon was working until the time of his death, mostly doing voice-overs for 
commercials. He also had been cast as yet another Indian in a forthcoming 
television movie. 
</P>
<P>
With a rich voice and impelling features, the Berlin-born Brandon -- who came 
to Hollywood with his family as a baby -- was only 20 when he began a two-year 
run as Squire Cribbs in the original "The Drunkard." The melodrama (followed by 
olio acts in which Brandon and the other performers sang and danced) ran for 
several decades at the old Theatre Mart on Vermont Avenue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon came to the attention of Hal Roach, the producer of the Laurel and 
Hardy comedies, and was cast under his real name, Henry Kleinbach, portraying 
Old Barnaby in the 1934 classic "Babes in Toyland." 
</P>
<P>
His stern visage found him in demand as an evildoer in such serials as "Drums 
of Fu Manchu," "Jungle Jim" and "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century." 
</P>
<P>
He was seen in dozens of films of the 1930s through the 1950s and was the 
animators' model for Captain Hook in Walt Disney's "Peter Pan," Butcher said. 
</P>
<P>
His film roles from those years include "Beau Geste," "Nurse Edith Cavell," 
"Underground," "Joan of Arc," "Pony Express," "The War of the Worlds," "Auntie 
Mame" and "The Big Fisherman." 
</P>
<P>
He portrayed Indian chiefs 26 times, including parts in "The Searchers" and 
"Two Rode Together" for director Ford. 
</P>
<P>
His last film credit was "When the North Wind Blows" in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
His survivors include a brother and sister.

$50 MILLION PROPOSED IN NEW S.D. TAXES, FEES; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: CITY MANAGER OFFERS COUNCIL OPTIONS TOWARD PAYING FOR ITS WISH LIST 
OF PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Manager John Lockwood, seeking more revenue to pay for a wish 
list of new programs tentatively established by the City Council, proposed more 
than $50 million in new taxes and fees Tuesday. The council could adopt them 
when it tackles the fiscal 1991 budget again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the options are a proposal to generate $10 million by charging for 
parking at city beaches and Mission Bay Park; a 5% residential utility users 
tax that would add about $44 annually to utility bills; and a 10% utility users 
tax for business and industry instead of the 5% tax that Lockwood suggested 
Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood would also add $5 million to business taxes and take $4.3 million in 
city hotel tax funds from arts and promotional programs to spend on other city 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
When coupled with a $20-million property-tax increase approved Feb. 8, $13 
million in new development fees and other tax proposals that may go on the 
ballot June 5, the $53.3 million in new suggested taxes and fees would balance 
$155.4 million in new spending that the council tentatively endorsed Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The spending package includes $54 million for a housing trust fund for the 
poor; $8 million for 400 new jail beds; $25 million for a new police and fire 
communications system and $12.8 million additional police officers. 
</P>
<P>
The council has until Feb. 26 to determine which of the proposed new taxes and 
fees it will place on the June 5 ballot for approval by voters. In addition to 
the Feb. 8 package tentatively approved, council members have said they will 
reverse their decision to enact a $20-million tax to fund city employees' 
retirement system and place that before voters as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything is going to go on the June ballot, we need to docket it for next 
week," when the council will make final decisions on tax increase proposals 
going before voters, Lockwood said. However, the council has more time to enact 
new taxes and fees that do not need voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest budget report, Lockwood also offered council members the option 
of living within the $432.6 million that definitely will be available when 
fiscal 1991 begins July 1. That revenue, however, will not even allow the city 
to keep services at levels provided by this year's $402 million budget, 
Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to forgoing much of the new spending desired by the council 
members, police response time would increase, library hours would be cut back, 
all recreation centers and pools would be closed, after-school recreation 
programs would be eliminated, improvements to Mission Bay Park would be put 
off, and the city's weed-abatement program would be eliminated, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Lockwood would reallocate $12 million from the $33 million now 
spent on promotional and arts programs toward other city needs.

HUNTER APPEARS IN COURT AS SENTENCING IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter made her first public appearance Tuesday since she was sent 
to jail without bail in December, looking wan but calm in court as she heard 
her formal sentencing on four counts of tax evasion put off for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-minute hearing, U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam formally postponed 
Hunter's sentencing until March 6 to give the agency preparing sentencing 
recommendations more time. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter appeared in court for about a minute, wearing a khaki jail-issue 
jumpsuit and blue sneakers. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, held by a 
pink elastic band. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, 51, a former Del Mar mayor, conferred several times in a whisper with 
her defense lawyer, Robert Brewer, but did not say anything to Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
After an eight-month trial, Hunter was convicted Dec. 11 of four of 197 counts. 
Gilliam immediately ordered her to await sentencing without bail at the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Hunter stem from her role as a top executive at the failed 
La Jolla investment firm J. David &amp; Co., from 1979 to 1984. Prosecutors 
allege that Hunter created false documents to lure investors to J. David and 
then to lull them into staying put while the firm slid toward bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a Ponzi 
scheme in which money from new investors was used to pay off earlier investors 
and little actual trading was done. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's ex-lover, firm founder J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, pleaded guilty in 
1985 to fraud and tax evasion in connection with the Ponzi scheme and is 
serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
The jury that convicted Hunter also acquitted her of one other tax charge, but 
deadlocked on 192 other counts, primarily fraud and conspiracy charges stemming 
from her role at J. David. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have said they intend to go to trial again next month on the 192 
counts. Defense lawyers Brewer and Richard Marmaro have asked for a retrial on 
the four tax evasion counts, claiming the jury found Hunter guilty of a phantom 
tax law and that Gilliam improperly pressured the jury. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Tuesday that he will consider that request March 6. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing today, Marmaro is due to report to Gilliam about whether he will 
remain Hunter's lawyer. Last week, he asked for time to "make adequate 
arrangements," apparently financial, so he can stay on the case. 
</P>
<P>
Once Hunter's new trial ends, with or without the four tax evasion charges, 
Hunter faces yet another trial, again stemming from the J. David affair.

MAN SAVED FROM DROWNING BY JOHN F. KENNEDY DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Henry (Mac) McMahon, who was saved from drowning by Navy Lt. John F. 
Kennedy after their PT boat was sunk by the Japanese during World War II, died 
Sunday in Encinitas. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services for McMahon will be held at 11 a.m. today at Encinitas 
Mortuary, followed by a private interment in Riverside National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon had lived in Encinitas since 1976, when he retired after 23 years as 
the postmaster of Cathedral City, Calif., near Palm Springs. He was best known 
for his role in the PT-109 tragedy, which made Kennedy -- the skipper of the 
boat and future president of the United States -- a hero. 
</P>
<P>
While patrolling the Blackett Strait near the Solomon Islands in August, 1943, 
the PT-109 was sliced in half by the Japanese destroyer Amatiro. The sinking 
and epic rescue of the crew were later depicted in a book and motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
Because he suffered extensive burns in the action, McMahon was unable to swim. 
The machinist mate first class was kept afloat for about four hours by Kennedy, 
who swam three miles to a small island with McMahon's life jacket between his 
teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"My stepfather often told me that he begged Kennedy to just leave him there, 
that the rescue was too difficult," said William Kelly, McMahon's stepson, who 
works for a shipbuilding company in Pascagoula, Miss. "He thought the world of 
President Kennedy, who saved his life, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
McMahon died of complications from pneumonia at Rancho Encinitas, an Encinitas 
convalescent home, where his granddaughter had taken him two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said that his mother, Rose, McMahon's wife of 62 years, has suffered the 
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease for two years and that, in caring for her, his 
stepfather's own condition had weakened. 
</P>
<P>
He said McMahon had always "liked and treasured Kennedy," not only for his 
heroism, but also for keeping in touch long after the war. He said President 
Kennedy once traveled with a crew of Secret Service agents from Los Angeles to 
Cathedral City just to have coffee with an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
He said the McMahons had dined with the Kennedys in Hyannis Port, Mass. "They 
knew the whole family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon was "rather quiet, subdued, he loved to read," Kelly said. "In his 
prime, he could read a novel a week. He enjoyed woodcarving. . . . He was an 
outstanding gentleman, a great guy and a great husband, and very modest for a 
man who had done so much, who had been all over the world. Because my own 
father died at an early age, I really saw my stepfather as my father. He will 
be missed very much."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERMARKET MANAGER SLAIN DURING HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police were seeking leads Tuesday in the Monday evening slaying of the manager 
of an Inglewood supermarket, who was shot and killed by three gunmen during a 
holdup.

Lennox area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
He died two hours later at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>

cash. 
</P>
<P>

robbers. 
</P>
<P>

MAYOR DENIES PLANS TO BUILD ON RESERVOIR; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: A LETTER FROM TOM BRADLEY SAYS THERE IS NO BASIS FOR REPORTS OF 
EFFORTS TO LURE TEACHERS TO LOS ANGELES WITH LOWER-COST HOMES ON A DRY LAKE 
BED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A proposal to develop a housing tract for teachers on the city-owned Chatsworth 
Reservoir brought vigorous opposition Tuesday from City Councilman Hal Bernson 
and local homeowner activists and denials from the mayor's office that the site 
was being seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said it would be moronic for anyone to believe he or the community 
would tolerate a disruption of the reservoir, a 1,200-acre dry lake bed now 
serving as a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiking and bird-watching -- those are the only kinds of things that should be 
permitted there," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, The Times reported City Hall sources as saying that the Tom 
Bradley Administration was developing a plan to build up to 5,000 units of low- 
to moderate-cost housing at the reservoir as a way to induce teachers to work 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There goes Bradley again -- the mayor has been totally insensitive to the 
needs of the Valley in the past," said Rita Seashore, vice president of the Oak 
Lake Assn., a group that represents 200 homeowners who reside south of the 
reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"For the mayor to be even considering this . . . is absolutely absurd," said 
Jan Hinkston, a founder of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. "Somebody's off 
their rocker." 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth site, which is owned by the city Department of Water and Power 
and is located in the west San Fernando Valley, was used as a reservoir from 
the 1930s until the early 1970s. It has been empty since being damaged in the 
1971 Sylmar earthquake. The site now functions as a de facto wildlife 
sanctuary, primarily for birds, including Canada geese. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani denied Tuesday that Bradley's office has 
seriously considered faculty housing for the reservoir. And the mayor sent a 
two-page letter to Bernson assuring the councilman that there "was no basis for 
the news media . . . to suggest that the Chatsworth Reservoir site has been 
targeted" for development. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Bradley wrote that no plan to develop the reservoir would "ever 
have been seriously considered and finalized without the cooperation and 
involvement of your office and interested community groups." 
</P>
<P>
Before a development site could be considered, it must be determined if it 
would be worthwhile public policy for the city to provide housing incentives as 
a way to lure teachers to jobs in Los Angeles, Fabiani said in an interview 
Tuesday. That threshold decision has not been made yet by the mayor's office, 
the deputy mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
But last week in an interview, Fabiani, in acknowledging that preliminary plans 
were being prepared to have the city promote faculty housing, called the 
Chatsworth Reservoir "the primary site we've focused on so far" and he said he 
intended to meet with Bernson and local community groups about this interest. 
"That's the land that's under consideration," he added. 
</P>
<P>
According to a City Hall source, who asked for anonymity, Art Gastelum, 
director of the Mayor's Office of Economic Development, said the development of 
faculty housing at the reservoir was one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, who is also the mayor's liaison to DWP, made the remarks to the 
Office of Economic Development staff in early January, shortly after Bradley 
appointed him to head that unit, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Gastelum's official assignments has been to explore ways to help 
local schools and universities attract top faculty to Los Angeles. One of the 
difficulties facing teacher recruiters has been the area's high housing costs. 
Fabiani said Gastelum "originated the idea of teacher incentives, like housing" 
within the Bradley Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum did not return a phone call from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact that that one site may have been mentioned by a single member of 
the mayor's staff does not a proposal make," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to this story was Times staff writer Gabe Fuentes.

<P>
SILVER SCREEN: CHUCK CARROLL IS LIVING HIS OWN HOLLYWOOD DREAM -- SCOOPING 
POPCORN, SELLING TICKETS AND PERFECTING HIS PROJECTION ROOM TECHNIQUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For independent-theater owner Chuck Carroll, the critical moment in any film 
isn't the sudden plot twist or steamy love scene. It doesn't even happen 
on-screen. It's a tense, split-second maneuver he calls The Switch-Over. 
</P>
<P>
The action takes place up in the darkened projection room, where, looming 
behind a pair of ancient 35-millimeter projectors, the owner of the La Paloma 
theater watches a huge revolving film reel moan and shudder, its celluloid 
strip winding down like giant thread on a spool. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to switch projectors without skipping a frame, a trick Carroll 
likens to patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
And Carroll is sweating, his heart is pounding, as he notices the flickering 
black dot at the top-right corner of the movie screen out front -- his cue to 
start the motor of the second projector, to flip a switch and let her roll. 
</P>
<P>
For the next 7.3 seconds, the two projectors play the same frames of film, only 
one image hitting the screen. And Carroll knows that, at precisely the right 
moment, he must shut down the first projector and switch on the lamp of the 
second -- all while focusing the light and adjusting the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Seven . . . six . . . five . . . . He counts backward, out loud, as tense as a 
heart surgeon during a transplant operation. Because to fail, Carroll knows, is 
to face the horror of a blank movie screen and endure the groans of a startled 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm done, I can go change my shirt," he says. "My heart is still 
pounding. It's a real thrill to throw the levers and push the buttons in the 
right sequence. Because if you don't get it exactly right, you can embarrass 
yourself in front of 100 people." 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, the 39-year-old computer analyst realized a longtime dream 
when he bought the 62-year-old La Paloma Theater in downtown Encinitas -- the 
stage and screen venue that's become a cultural icon in the North County 
seaside town. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't matter that his only show business experience came from the viewing 
seats of a movie theater. To Carroll, running his own movie house -- especially 
the La Paloma -- looked more exciting than any starring film role could ever 
be. 
</P>
<P>
So this summer, he traded his life savings to begin operating the 450-seat 
theater with the graceful Spanish architecture that local researchers say once 
served as a stopover venue for Hollywood film stars on their way to Mexican 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
As a customer, Carroll had always admired the high, sculptured ceilings and 
hand-painted tiles that are found everywhere inside the La Paloma, including 
the bathroom walls -- and even on the ticket kiosk out front. 
</P>
<P>
He liked the fact that this was a roomy, big-screen theater, not the shoe-box 
size of many newfangled facilities. And he liked the eight-inch-high black 
letters that were still painstakingly hooked to the marquee before each film, 
just like in the golden days. 
</P>
<P>
"One day I saw a business opportunity ad in the paper for a North County 
theater, and I said to myself, this couldn't be the La Paloma," he said, 
perched in the theater's balcony. "But it was! And so I went running down 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't keep my poker face. I was drooling, sitting on the edge of my 
seat, at the chance to get to own this place. I guess it was my enthusiasm that 
got me this theater." 
</P>
<P>
Now, twice nightly -- after he finishes his daytime computer job -- Carroll has 
been perfecting his switch-over technique. That is, of course, when he's not 
working the box office, serving popcorn at the concession stand, playing usher 
with his tiny pocket flashlight or sweeping up Goobers and Raisinette boxes at 
the end of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having a ball," he said, setting up the reels for a Valentine's Day 
showing of "The War of the Roses." "This is something I dreamed about as a kid, 
being able to see movies for free." 
</P>
<P>
Then he paused. "Well, sorta free, after you add on the sometimes 30 or 40 
hours a week I put in here." 
</P>
<P>
In the film-playing business, however, Carroll, a San Diego native now living 
in La Costa, is a decided long shot -- a novice with no movie house experience, 
using double features and reduced prices to compete with the multiplex big 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the film brokers reserve the newest films for the more profitable 
multi-screen venues, so Carroll must wait several weeks before he can book a 
first-run show -- often after the excitement over a new release has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the burgeoning video rental market. Who wants to sit in a 
cavernous old movie theater watching films that will be out on video in a few 
months anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"That place has gone through more owners than a counterfeit bill," said one 
mall multiplex manager who asked not to be named. "We don't even consider the 
place competition." 
</P>
<P>
Even Alan Grossberg, a former La Paloma owner whose entertainment company still 
books movies for the theater, is skeptical of such a newcomer making an 
immediate splash. 
</P>
<P>
"If he was doing everything on his own, I'd say he'd have no chance in hell," 
he said. "But he's using an experienced company to get his product. All he has 
to do is advertise." 
</P>
<P>
But Carroll is a strapping 6-foot-4 redhead with a few ideas of his own. He's 
running his theater with all the enthusiasm of a regular moviegoer who one day 
decided to buy the place so he could do things right. 
</P>
<P>
"I always liked real butter when I was watching a movie, so the first thing I 
did was to get rid of that oily, fake stuff they used to serve and replace it 
with the real thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby, Carroll has installed a suggestion box and is entertaining ideas 
such as showing hard-to-find foreign films and having Bogart and Hitchcock 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
There's no on-screen advertising before a show -- that would spoil the mood. 
This theater owner plays music -- tapes from his personal collection, not 
elevator jazz. He's as much in control as the gray-haired man behind the 
curtain in "The Wizard of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps the theater dark," whispered one customer, "so people can smooch 
before the movie if they want to." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll runs his business like it's 1955 in the heart of Nebraska. At the La 
Paloma, things like neighborliness, quality and respect for the elderly mean 
something. 
</P>
<P>
He charges $3.50 for most feature films, about half what the mainstream 
theaters collect. There are also dollar-off senior citizen discounts, such as 
the "Good Ole Folks" price for people 55 or older. 
</P>
<P>
And for the "Really Ole Folks" -- people as old as the 62-year-old theater 
itself -- the price is $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
"You get people in here who are old and proud of it," Carroll said. "One guy 
remembered coming here in 1929 and paying 10 cents to see a matinee." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's even revived the $1.75 Saturday children's matinees. To some North 
County parents, he's known as a free baby-sitter, waiting outside the theater 
while the kids ramble out of station wagons. Cub Scouts in uniform get in for a 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
At the concession stand, he patiently counts out their nickels and dimes. And 
if the kids come up short, Carroll has even developed a barter system -- he 
lets them make up the difference by helping him clean the theater after the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I lose money on these shows, but they're fun," he said. "I play all the 
cartoons I missed the first time, so now I get to to see them, too." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll plans to begin showing Saturday afternoon reruns of movies he enjoyed 
as a child -- such as "The Incredible Shrinking Man" and "Abbott and Costello 
Meet the Mummy" -- in an attempt to draw parents inside with their children. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to revive the practice of showing cartoons before each feature 
and serials such as "Flash Gordon." 
</P>
<P>
If the kids are interested, Carroll will give them a tour of the projection 
room or tell them about the famed ghost of the La Paloma -- the moviegoer who 
toppled from the balcony in 1929 after having too much to drink. Word has it 
that the ghost can be seen after some shows, wandering the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Carroll might even make the old ghost feel a little more at 
home. Someday, he wants to refurbish the lobby with its original decor, 
including telephones and other fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll's master plan also includes establishing the La Paloma as more than 
just a movie theater and turning it into an all-entertainment venue, making use 
of the structure's large stage as well as the screen. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Miss Encinitas competition will take place at the La Paloma, and 
two children's theater groups will soon take the stage there on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll has even revived the Friday night showing of "The Rocky Horror Picture 
Show," a campy, low-budget film that has become a cult movie among teens and 
young adults. Carroll has added his own strange twist -- strange even for this 
movie. He has auditioned a group of high school students to perform on stage 
directly in front of the screen, lip-syncing the dialogue of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, along with the addition of a local garage band before the flick, has 
made the night a success, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, one of the live music nights Carroll sponsored produced perhaps his 
darkest hour as theater operator. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, during a multi-band performance of punk and heavy-metal 
music, a 16-year-old youth was stabbed inside the movie house by a 24-year-old 
recently paroled convict from El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The violence shocked Carroll and forced the postponement of a 62nd birthday 
party planned for the theater. Instead, the La Paloma recently staged a benefit 
concert, raising more than $800 for the injured youth. 
</P>
<P>
The boy took the stage during the benefit, and his mother offered a poignant 
talk about random violence. At the end, Carroll recalled, there wasn't a dry 
eye in the house. 
</P>
<P>
"The benefit was therapy for both of us," Carroll said of the victim. "We found 
we could have an entertainment show without having to fend for your life. For 
both of us, it was like getting back on the horse after a fall." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the violence, North County residents continue to support the La Paloma, 
Carroll said, adding that the theater has become a cultural landmark people 
want to keep around. 
</P>
<P>
"I get lots of calls from locals who want to know what I'm playing in the 
future, people who are willing to wait a few weeks for a film so they can see 
it at La Paloma." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's the movies that people like. Or maybe they like the idea of 
patronizing a theater where things are still done the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody got mad, for example, when Carroll accidentally left the lens cap on the 
projector, delaying the movie. And when one of the two ancient machines 
recently broke down, nobody complained. 
</P>
<P>
For a whole week, Carroll was forced to announce a brief intermission while he 
changed reels. Instead of a disaster, though, his popcorn sales went up. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing is a gamble, I admit it," he said. "Statistics show I have 
about 1 chance in 10 of making it. But I intend to beat those odds. My goal is 
to have fun, provide something to the community and break even, if that's 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Go looking for Chuck Carroll some Saturday afternoon and you'll find him 
sitting through the cartoon features with the rest of the young audience. 
</P>
<P>
He's the big red-haired kid with glasses, the one sitting in his favorite seat 
10 rows back in the center, eating popcorn served with real butter.

REJECTION URGED FOR PLAN TIED TO ROAD EXTENSION; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: THE DEAL WOULD BRING THOUSAND OAKS BLVD. TO A PARK'S BORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County planners are recommending rejection of a controversial 
development proposal linked to the extension of Thousand Oaks Boulevard to the 
edge of a national park. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Regional Planning Commission is scheduled today to hold its first 
public hearing on the proposal, known as Malibu Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which would be built on 494 vacant acres west of Las Virgenes Road 
in Calabasas, would include 1,700 apartments, 116 houses and 60,000 square feet 
of commercial space. County land-use plans now allow for only 112 homes on the 
land, which the county has deemed an ecologically significant area. 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of the project's approval, the county Department of Public Works 
has suggested that the developer be required to build a one-mile extension of 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard to the eastern edge of the Santa Monica Mountains 
National Recreation Area. Area environmentalists have opposed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation released Tuesday by the Regional Planning Department was 
contained in one word: "denial." 
</P>
<P>
The staff report did not elaborate. But, planner Don Culbertson said, the 
request for a housing density 16 times above the county plan appeared to be 
unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
Public works officials have maintained that the extension of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard is needed and should be required if the project is approved. 
</P>
<P>
A public works spokeswoman said Tuesday that the department simply wants the 
road built and has expressed no preference about how many dwelling units should 
be allowed in Malibu Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
But an environmental impact report commissioned by the developer, Las Virgenes 
Properties of Sunnyvale, linked the number of units in the proposal to the cost 
of building the extension called for by the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Culbertson noted that one reason he does not favor the project is that it alone 
would generate about half the traffic capacity of the proposed road extension. 
</P>
<P>
Project opponents Mary Lou Thornton, president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners 
Federation, and Fran Pavley, an Agoura Hills councilwoman, said they were 
pleased with Culbertson's recommendation. But, they said, they expect the 
controversy to continue until the final decision is made by the county 
supervisors.

HIGH DESERT SCHOOLS TO GET ANTI-GANG PROBATION OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county program that provides extra supervision for high school students on 
probation is being expanded from its birthplace in South-Central Los Angeles to 
the more rural setting of the Antelope Valley, where gang problems are a 
growing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next month, one officer of the county Probation Department's School 
Crime Suppression Program will be assigned to work exclusively with the six 
schools in the Antelope Valley Union High School District, county and school 
officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The aims of the effort are to reduce crime on campus, cut truancy and provide 
more direct supervision and counseling to about 50 of the estimated 300 youths 
-- gang members and others -- on probation among the nearly 10,000 students in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
"We see it as preventive in nature," said Sandra Moss-Manson, director of the 
Probation Department program. "If we can keep these kids from going on into 
more criminal activity, we'd feel we're being effective." 
</P>
<P>
The program began in 1981 and until now has encompassed 13 schools, mostly in 
South-Central Los Angeles, county officials said. In that area, where there are 
more offenders who have committed graver crimes -- the county funds a full-time 
probation officer at each campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley district is one of the first in the county to contract for 
a similar service by agreeing to share the cost with the Probation Department. 
District officials said they expect to pay about $9,000 for the remainder of 
the school year while evaluating the program. 
</P>
<P>
Probation officials said the Antelope Valley officer probably will concentrate 
on trying to keep students out of gangs. "What he's supposed to be doing is 
identifying the 'pre-gang' kids and nipping it in the bud," said Lois Jones, 
head of the department's Antelope Valley office. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Antelope Valley was considered mostly free of serious gang 
problems. But gangs and gang violence have become a growing concern, 
particularly in the past year, prompting the high school district to pass an 
anti-gang dress code and provide funds for a sheriff's deputy to patrol the 
high schools full time. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Esquivel, the deputy probation officer being assigned to the high school 
district, lives in the Antelope Valley and has worked at the county's Mira Loma 
probation camp near Lancaster, officials said. He is slated to start March 1 
and rotate among the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Esquivel is expected to oversee fewer than 50 students, visiting their homes 
and schools. By contrast, regular juvenile probation officers typically handle 
150 or more cases, at best see their youngsters for only brief periods each 
month, and mostly work out of their offices. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 250 or so students on probation will continue to be overseen by 
their regular probation officers.

COLD SNAP'S DAMAGE TO CROPS LESS THAN FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports from San Diego County farmers suggest that last week's cold spell did 
relatively little damage, contrary to initial fears, according to Bill 
Snodgrass, the county's assistant agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers now believe that an estimated 5% of the county's $100-million avocado 
crop was damaged during the cold spell that broke with the arrival of last 
weekend's rainstorm, Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry and cucumber crops appear to have fared even better, according to 
farmers' reports, Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been any more damage since last Wednesday or Thursday. But we're 
waiting for reports on some of the borderline stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are now trying to determine if fruit that remains on trees has been 
damaged by the cold. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing they look at are if the cells on stems have been damaged," Snodgrass 
said. "If there's been stem damage, the good fruit can fall off." 
</P>
<P>
Mature avocados that fall off trees during cold spells can often be salvaged, 
he said. Consequently, consumers should enjoy an increased supply -- and 
possibly, lower prices -- during coming weeks. But, longer term, the cold will 
reduce the size of this year's avocado crop, Snodgrass said. 
</P>
<P>
The recent cold snap was "nothing like the freeze we had 2 1/2 years ago," he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it was so bad there was nothing to pick."

A VITAL PUBLIC-SAFETY MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian now has on his desk AB 497, one of the most important 
pieces of public- safety legislation passed by the California Legislature in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which was introduced by Democratic Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly 
of Sacramento, extends the current 15-day waiting period between the sale of a 
handgun and its delivery to the sale of rifles and shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
The interval not only provides a welcome cooling-off period for unbalanced or 
distraught people bent on obtaining a gun, but also allows the Department of 
Justice to ensure that the buyer is not a convicted felon or a person found 
mentally infirm under law. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian has indicated his willingness to sign such a measure, but some 
of his aides now are asking AB 497's sponsors to consider amending the proposal 
to guarantee that within a few years the background check would be accomplished 
instantaneously by computer. 
</P>
<P>
This idea already has been explored and rejected by the Legislature. No such 
technology exists at present; if it did, the cost would be astronomical. 
Moreover, since the background-checking system now is financed entirely by the 
$5 fees on gun purchases, those huge increased costs would have to be borne by 
legitimate sportsmen, gun collectors and shooting enthusiasts. Perhaps worst of 
all, an instant background check would eliminate the critical, sometimes 
life-saving, cooling-off period. 
</P>
<P>
A carefully drafted, thoroughly debated bill like AB 497 should not be tinkered 
with in this eleventh hour. The governor should sign the measure as it is or 
simply let it become law without his signature, as the state's Constitution 
allows.

THE ILLOGIC OF SECRET AIDS TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investigation by a UCLA professor of medicine has found widespread use of 
clandestine AIDS testing by hospitals in the United States, a procedure that 
violates the law in many states, including California, and runs counter to 
standards of ethics and appropriate practice. The practice betrays an unwelcome 
panic among professionals regarding the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Informed consent is appropriate for any such testing. Furthermore, the testing 
should include counseling of the patient both before the test and when the 
results are shared. But those hospitals undertaking the secret tests apparently 
are more concerned with the safety of the medical staff than with the 
well-being of the patient, according to the study. Most deny that the tests are 
undertaken. The results generally are not shared with the patient. On occasion 
the results have led to alterations in hospital procedures or the transfer of 
patients to other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone's concerned about being exposed," Dr. Charles E. Lewis, 
author of the report, said. That is understandable. But the concern does not 
justify this practice. Indeed, the secret testing could be counterproductive, 
encouraging a false sense of security by staff when treating persons who have 
tested negative to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. The 
test does not always reveal infection. That is why federal regulations have 
provided appropriate procedures to protect health-care providers. The 
procedures should be followed without regard to test results. 
</P>
<P>
No health-care work is without risk. Doctors, dentists and nurses face graver 
risks than AIDS, however. The Centers for Disease Control counts a total of 19 
health-care providers who have become infected with HIV over the years, 
compared with a much higher annual death toll related to acute hepatitis B 
infection. The CDC estimates that 15 health-care workers die each year from 
hepatitis infection, and an additional 240 from liver cancer or cirrhosis of 
the liver attributable to an earlier infection with hepatitis B. Given such 
statistics, the medical logic for secret AIDS tests is extremely elusive.

OUR BEACHES ARE TAKING A BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Are these the Southern California beaches pictured on the post cards, the ones 
that fill the family album, the ones where movie stars loll as clear and gentle 
waves blanket them? Even an ever-upbeat pop group like the Beach Boys would 
find little here to inspire song: After all, surfing safaris need open beaches. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, parts of Southern California's famous coastline have 
been at least temporarily shut down, closed to the public from Topanga to 
Laguna because of man-made spills of sewage and oil. In Orange County, 
Huntington Beach remains closed as oil spill cleanup operations continue. Then 
a sewage spill of nearly 8 million gallons closed 18 miles of beaches in Los 
Angeles County last weekend after the first major rainstorm of the season. Four 
miles remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
For that spill, there is plenty of blame to go around: Los Angeles politicians 
in the 1970s were quick to approve major commercial and residential 
developments but failed to push for necessary bond issues that could have 
improved the overburdened sewage system before it became decrepit. Voters also 
failed to approve key bond issues when they were on the ballot. Finally, after 
a federal lawsuit against the city for its continued dumping of concentrated 
sewage into Santa Monica Bay -- and after a series of spills -- the city agreed 
to upgrade the deteriorating system. A line from Culver City to the Hyperion 
sewage treatment plant in El Segundo is under construction and will greatly 
increase capacity when completed in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
But even when the new sewer line is completed, it will have no effect on the 
separate storm-drain system, which these days contains less and less water, and 
more and more litter. During the first big rain of the season, what flows 
through storm drains -- and eventually onto the beach and into the ocean -- is 
a river of oily water and trash. It includes all the cups drivers have tossed 
out car windows, all the gum wrappers pedestrians have carelessly tossed onto 
the sidewalk, all the fast-food junk improperly discarded. Los Angeles-area 
residents are said to throw away enough trash every five days to fill Dodger 
Stadium. We might all think about where that trash will end up the next time we 
complain about the sad state of Southern California's beaches.

TAXING PENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The letter from Vernon W. Latshaw (Feb. 8) doesn't tell the whole story. There 
are 13 states that tax pensions of people who have moved to other states. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 31 states have the mechanism in place to begin this practice. A 
retiree could very likely be taxed in two states (or possibly more) on his 
pension income! 
</P>
<P>
Two members of Congress have introduced bills to prohibit this practice. Sen. 
Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has introduced SB 434, which has three co-sponsors and Rep. 
Barbara Vucanovich (R-Nev.) has introduced HR 1227, which has 33 co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Latshaw and other retirees (or about-to-be retirees) might wish to 
write their representatives to urge their support of these bills.

What a mess.

<P>
No, I don't mean the oil spill, I mean the debris left at the high water line,

<P>
The oil companies have had only two accidental oil spills in the past 20 years. 
And considering the millions and millions of gallons of oil that is handled, 
that is not a bad record. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, our beaches generally look very much like a garbage dump

DREXEL'S BANKRUPTCY

<TEXT>
<P>
So Drexel was "forced to file" for bankruptcy because of default on loans 
totaling about $100 million. Maybe they should have borrowed from Milken to 
whom they paid $550 million in just one year. I doubt that he invested that in 
junk bonds.

QUESTIONS ASKED YOUNG SURVIVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Silent Statement: Prosecutor Uses Dramatics to Sum Up in 
Manslaughter Trial," Metro, Feb. 7: Well, I think I've finally heard it all! 
Don't they teach ethics in law school? 
</P>
<P>
Here we have an intoxicated man who slams into innocent people killing four and 
mentally injuring one young man. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the defending lawyer has the gall to interrogate the survivor as to whether 
he had 1 or 2, or even 5 seconds to try to warn the victims of the approach of 
the speeding car! 
</P>
<P>
Who is the victim and who is the criminal? I know it is up to the lawyer to 
defend his client to the best of his ability, but this is over and above the 
call of duty! In fact it is tantamount to child abuse! 
</P>
<P>
Don't you think that this young man is going to relive over and over again what 
happened that tragic day, without trying to also make him feel that he was a 
contributing factor in some way? 
</P>
<P>
I would like to say to the young man, "I am terribly sorry for your horrible 
losses, you did nothing wrong and I hope that time will heal your wounds."

DRUG USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real story behind The Times' coverage on the 35.4% drop in high school drug 
usage is that this occurred despite an all-time high percentage (58.7%) of 
students who said that cocaine was "very easy" to get (Part A, Feb. 14). 
</P>
<P>
What does that do to the political warlords of the "War on Drugs" who claim 
that interdiction, not education is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the drop in usage of both cocaine (and cigarettes) is occurring despite 
a huge, easy supply of such drugs. Stopping drugs from being available is not 
only impossible but a total waste of money. To educate and treat is the obvious 
answer. In this case, the figures don't lie: Stop the "war" and educate, 
rehabilitate, and stop crowding the courts and prisons with wasted efforts to 
stop what can't be stopped, which is the illegal sale of drugs.

PEACE DIVIDEND REINVEST IT; 
</P>
<P>
A LIFELINE TO GET US OFF THE ROCKS; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICA NEEDS A WHOLESALE CONVERSION, NOT JUST CUTBACKS, OF ITS COLD WAR 
ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM G. SHEPHERD, William G. Shepherd is a professor of economics at the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.

<TEXT>
<P>
America is twiddling its thumbs as it begins to debate the freeing of possible 
modest resources from future military budgets. Maybe some, says President Bush, 
but not much. Maybe more, say others, by the mid- and late-1990s. But the 
opportunity comes from different sources and is more urgent and richer than 
they realize. The issue is conversion -- creatively planned and on a large 
scale -- not merely cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The "peace dividend" metaphor is a false image; both words are wrong. A 
dividend is commonly received in the mail by affluent people, at leisure, and 
banked for future luxuries. The United States, however, is in serious distress, 
sinking deeper into international economic mediocrity and debt. 
</P>
<P>
Military conversion offers a lifeline, not just a bonus. Experts agree that 
diverting research and development, capital and millions of workers to the 
military has retarded the U.S. economy, as the Japanese and West Germany 
successes show by contrast. Redirecting military resources offers the only 
large, foreseeable new source of national competitive strength. 
</P>
<P>
A large shift is possible and involves especially valuable resources for 
science, new products, managerial excellence, new capital and plain productive 
power. Though the resources are "only" about 7% of our gross national product, 
they are critical to raising productivity. Getting them out of indulgent 
military contracts and onto the open market is widely expected to sharpen the 
productive mentality and methods of industry in a broader range of markets. 
</P>
<P>
The second error is to believe that "peace" is new, that it arises only from 
the changes in Eastern Europe. The awesome Soviet military assets are still 
there, it is said, and any reversion to a new Stalinism would restore the Cold 
War threat, catching us off guard. Better keep our military large and "strong," 
just in case. 
</P>
<P>
A wide body of new research shows that the threat of military conquest or 
nuclear blackmail has been virtually nonexistent since at least Stalin's death 
in 1953 and probably since 1943, when the tide turned in World War II. There 
has never been a real possibility that nuclear missiles would force our 
"surrender," or that Soviet tanks would roll across Western Europe. The age of 
conquest for true national gain ceased with Adolf Hitler; indeed, his failure 
proved the point beyond any serious doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Yet militant "anti-communism" prevailed, and the military sector drained huge 
flows of resources from the economy. Ironically, the weapons themselves became 
the main source of danger, from the risks of mad or mistaken attacks. They did 
not "keep the peace," which already existed between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
In the Kafkaesque world of Cold Warriors, strength caused economic weakness, 
"allies" (the Philippines, Turkey and others) drained vital national resources, 
weapons for "security" caused insecurity, and parts of the U.S. economy became 
hooked on the narcotic of uncompetitive military spending. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. leadership is now in the addict's stage of denial. They say that there is 
no problem, that the military extravagances of the 1980s were necessary to 
intimidate the Soviets, that the wastes were really modest and that no major 
changes are needed and so on. These attitudes are blocking us from the obvious, 
rich solutions. We need to advance to the cure phase, where withdrawal is rapid 
and a new life is carefully constructed, free of the military drug. 
</P>
<P>
This is the Administration's historic opportunity. Other leaders dream about 
such a chance, where virtually everybody can be a winner. Bush has it in his 
hands, but there are disturbing signs that nothing is being done. 
</P>
<P>
The task is twofold: first, to understand the magnificent scope of this 
opportunity, which has been there all along during the functionless Cold War; 
second, to mount a comprehensive New Era program for redirecting critical 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
This prodigious opportunity is immediate, like an 80-yard pass when the home 
team is behind late in the game. Will Bush and Congress fumble, as it now 
seems? Do they understand the urgency, the opportunity? The future of 250 
million people hangs on their actions.

THE SOVIET ECONOMY WILL REBOUND AND ITS MILITARY- INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX WILL

By F. ANDY MESSING JR., Retired Special Forces Maj. F. Andy Messing Jr., 
executive director of the National Defense Council Foundation, has visited 20 
low-intensity conflicts worldwide. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a preemptive move, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney announced a 
"streamlining" of the U.S. military, theoretically to save $39 billion. He had 
previously ordered the defense Establishment to reduce spending by $180 billion 
over a three-year period. Now President Bush is planning troop cutbacks. These 
are opening plays in a football game between the Administration and Congress -- 
a game designed to take advantage of the temporary aberration caused by the 
greatest geopolitical reorganization since World War II. But the players are 
not focusing on certain vectors that will eventually converge and how to handle 
them. 
</P>
<P>
From 1946 to 1956, Japan and Germany rebuilt their states with the help of 
countries that were instruments of their defeat. In that period, the world saw 
these nations rebound and become stable. Then, between 1957 and 1970, they 
became serious competitors in the world marketplace. After 1971, they became 
superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
Today we see an analogous situation: The West is starting to rebuild the Soviet 
Union and the East Bloc. But it will not take the Soviets as long to recover. 
The Soviets' natural resources, technological advances and taste for a better 
life will make their rebound possible, amazing even their most cynical 
detractors. 
</P>
<P>
The only major difference today from 40 years ago is that both the Japanese and 
German military-industrial complexes were destroyed and then restricted. But 
the military-industrial complex of the Soviet Union will still be intact, 
commanding about one-quarter of gross national product. Keeping in mind that 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may not have real control over his military, 
much less be able to retain power, one can safely assume that the Soviet 
military institution will promote its own agenda. Careful moves will enable it 
to survive an initial contraction and flourish as the economic transformation 
occurs, thanks to Western investment. Mutant forces -- in Cuba, Vietnam, Angola 
and other areas -- will emulate this model, generating their own turmoil. This 
will contribute to conflict aimed at the Free World for decades to come. 
</P>
<P>
The expanding world population, with its depletion of our environment and 
resources, is another vector generating conflict. The population of our planet 
is 5.3 billion and growing exponentially. This crowding will replicate the 
psychology experiment demonstrating how two mice in a grocery box with an ounce 
of cheese are friendly, 20 under the same conditions are feisty and 200 
murderous. The competition for markets, resources and trade routes will in 
itself generate turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the idea that war will become obsolete, as predicted by the 
authors of "Megatrends 2000," especially when the drug and terrorism vectors 
are considered, is unfortunately ridiculous. The notion that the level of 
intensity will decrease is pure fantasy, because the proliferation of nuclear, 
biological and chemical weapons is on the increase. 
</P>
<P>
As the world reels under an average of 30 wars a year, our leaders are 
auctioning off our constitutionally mandated defense Establishment for a "peace 
dividend" that is shortsighted compared to the consequences. The remaining 
hollow shell, if not directed toward these specific, expanding threats, will 
eventually prove as rigid as the French military was in the late '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Our President and military leaders, when cutting defense spending, should not 
be tempted to use a sledgehammer when they can use a scalpel. Accordingly, 
there must be selective use of Special Operation Forces to keep violence at its 
lowest level. Conventional brute force will be too expensive in terms of 
manpower, political risk and resources for the increasing and frequent small 
conflicts around the world. It should be saved and used only when appropriate, 
with Congress supporting this concept. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney must not focus on a cheaper version of the same old military with the 
same antiquated insights. He has to reorient and redesign our defense 
Establishment to meet these multidimensional threats with the resources to do 
the job of protecting America.

<P>
I sold my car last month. I didn't trade it in for a new model or sell it with 
the intention of buying another. I sold it for good. 
</P>
<P>
The idea began, I'm ashamed to say, with a bumper sticker. I've always regarded 
people who gather inspiration from a slogan that fits across a fender as 
simple-minded. But this one had the power of imperative: "Think Globally/Act 
Locally." The environmentalist's "charity begins at home." 
</P>
<P>
I was riding my bike when I saw it, which made me feel pretty smug, musing on 
the irony that the vehicle spreading this message was polluting in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Next there was the image on the "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." Essayist Ann 
Taylor-Fleming was talking about Los Angeles residents and their penchant for 
driving solo, and the camera pulled back from a single driver at his wheel to 
reveal a freeway jammed with cars, each occupied by the driver alone. 
</P>
<P>
Next came the report in the Los Angeles Times that the average car gives out 
its weight in carbon monoxide each year. But what could be done? Everyone knows 
-- it's axiomatic -- "You can't live without a car in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
But could I? 
</P>
<P>
I am a writer. I work at home, in a neighborhood with a bank, post office, 
Federal Express, market, cafe and laundry within walking distance. I have 
always driven judiciously -- bicycling to shops, restaurants and friends too 
far to reach on foot but too close to justify a drive. For years I'd begrudged 
my car, which sat in my driveway nine days out of 10, feeding on insurance 
premiums and loan payments I could barely afford. It occurred to me that I had 
the car only out of passive acceptance of the "you-can't-live-here-without-one" 
axiom. With utter resignation, I had lamented the "need" to get around at the 
expense of the air I was traveling through. 
</P>
<P>
Jarred by the slogan on the bumper sticker, the freeway images and the carbon 
monoxide reports in the press, my conscience kicked in (in league, I admit, 
with pure pragmatism). 
</P>
<P>
Here was a chance to receive a quick infusion of cash, as well as relief from 
the burdensome costs involved in maintaining and operating a vehicle I resented 
for how it forced me to foul what I would rather protect. I won't try to fudge 
the fact that I wouldn't have ditched my car if it would have meant 
jeopardizing my livelihood; I'm privileged that my economic and ethical 
interests meet in this way. 
</P>
<P>
Reactions from my friends and family were mixed. Some saluted my initiative. 
Others questioned my sanity, for good reason. Los Angeles, with its wide 
streets and long, flat stretches, ought to be a bikeable city. It's not. 
Drivers in Los Angeles have as little regard for bicycles as they do for speed 
limits and stop signs. Further, illusions of the bucolic delights of two-wheel 
travel can't hold up to the reality of breathing the fumes of passing vehicles. 
The city's few designated bikeways begin and end without discernable logic, and 
the RTD buses bear down on us like bullying birds of prey. And the volume of 
broken glass and abundance of buckled pavement make commuting by bike 
dauntingly risky, even for a cautious, seasoned cyclist. 
</P>
<P>
But I like to think that my decision has had benefits beyond sparing the city 
my share of smog. In the month since I've signed off on my registration, the 
family-run market up the street has seen a lot more of me, and the chain 
supermarket a few miles away, much less. 
</P>
<P>
The money I've saved in gas has covered the difference in cost between having 
my wash done weekly by the independent laundress three blocks away, and driving 
to do it myself at the chain Laundromat several miles from here. I did my 
holiday shopping in the peace of a pile of mail-order catalogues. Most 
heartening of all, my landlady's child and his friends have chalked a hopscotch 
board on my space in my driveway, turning it into a neighborhood playground.

PRO BASKETBALL: SACRAMENTO GUARD, MENTIONED IN CLIPPER TRADE POSSIBILITIES, 
HELPS BEAT L.A. FOR SECOND CONSECUTIVE DAY, 99-90.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On top of back-to-back losses to the Sacramento Kings, the Clippers have had to 
deal with back-to-back Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
That is the same Ainge who has been mentioned prominently in Clipper trade 
possibilities, the same guy who has indicated previously he would welcome such 
a move rather than be a 30-year-old stuck in a three-year plan here. 
</P>
<P>
The same guard who helped beat the Clippers with 29 points and 13 assists in a 
two-point victory Monday afternoon at the Sports Arena. And followed that 
Tuesday night with 30 points on 12-of-21 shooting, six assists and four steals 
in a 99-90 victory before 17,014 at Arco Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of it all. But with the trading deadline of 6 p.m. PST Thursday, it 
apparently would take some sudden developments for the Kings to soften their 
asking price of Joe Wolf and a first-round pick for Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
A second loss in as many days to the last-place Kings dropped the Clippers to 
21-30 and within six games of the cellar in the Pacific Division. Once 18-19, 
they have lost 11 of 14. 
</P>
<P>
Ainge, of course, was largely to blame again Tuesday. Taking advantage of 
favorable matchups against smaller, less-experienced Clipper guards, he 
operated with relative ease inside. 
</P>
<P>
Any changes for Ainge would appear to be in communication. In a radio interview 
Monday with Ralph Lawler on the Clipper pregame show, Ainge, coveted because he 
has playoff experience with Boston and can play both backcourt positions, came 
off like someone who would have no problem with a deal to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
But some 24 hours later, he flatly said he wanted to remain in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the last thing I want," he said of a trade. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have asked me a couple of months ago, I might have, although I 
never would have said it." 
</P>
<P>
Don Casey had nothing to say about a deal for Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
"No comment," he said. "No comment on any trade." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Casey has other problems to worry about, and they're on the roster now. 
</P>
<P>
After being outscored, 30-16, in the opening quarter the night before at the 
Sports Arena, the Clippers, again without flu-stricken Benoit Benjamin, made a 
much better first impression in the rematch. For a while, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
They took a 20-11 lead with Charles Smith, coming off a 31-point performance, 
accounting for eight of the total and David Rivers six more. 
</P>
<P>
But after a timeout, Sacramento, playing its second straight game without 
starting point guard Vinny Del Negro, who sprained his ankle at a Sports Arena 
practice Sunday, finished the final three minutes of the quarter with an 11-2 
run. The only Clipper points in that stretch came on Ken Norman's jump shot 
with 1:30 left. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper problems continued in the second quarter, but there was more. As the 
King run reached 17-2, and the advantage 28-22, Casey's lineup looked, well, 
fresh. Smith, with two fouls, didn't play in the period, nor did Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Who did? Ken Bannister got 12 minutes, Jim Les, Tom Garrick and Joe Wolf nine 
each. The starters mostly rested. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no statement to be made," Casey said. "The statement is we're 
grappling for points and players." 
</P>
<P>
By halftime, Sacramento, which beat the Clippers for the third time in four 
meetings, was ahead, 46-41. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
No announcement was made Tuesday, but there is a good chance rookie guard Jay 
Edwards will be put back on the injured list because of tendinitis in the left 
knee, the same injury that sidelined him nearly all of training camp and the 
first 2 1/2 months of the regular season. It's not as serious this time, but 
Edwards did not dress for Monday's game against Sacramento at the Sports Arena 
and stayed behind when the Clippers completed the home-and-home matchup 
Tuesday. "The concern is that it will be (serious), if he keeps playing and 
practicing," said team physician Eugene Osher, who examined Edwards Monday. 
"Some rest would do him good."

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trout fishermen may find the fish bigger than usual in Los Angeles County's 
Puddingstone Reservoir, where there remains a surplus of big fish left from a 
plant by a private hatchery for the Big Fish Trout Derby last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Meissner of San Dimas won the tournament with a 6 1/2-pound trout, and 
according to tournament chairman Ron Lindblom, "the place will be loaded for a 
couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Fishing generally slow. Some striped bass activity in lower basin 
on anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Striped bass providing most action, biting in scattered 
locations in deep water. Spoons, frozen anchovies and live shad all working. 
Largemouth bass and catfish slow. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass still best off Davis Dam, most taken on 
anchovies. Trout fair in river, most pan-sized. Crappie fairly active in Topock 
Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina most active off North Shore Jetty, starting 
to bite on artificials but best on live shad. Croaker fair in Niland area. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Two trout plants last Thursday. Best from marina to launching 
area for shore fishermen. Raymond Cabun, Pacoima, 3 1/4-pound trout. Boat 
fishermen doing best near Little Cachuma, Bobcat and Johnson's coves. 
Largemouth bass picking up, biting along rocky cliffs. Jerry McCall, Santa Ana,

DESTRUCTION OF MONO COUNTY STREAM DOESN'T GO TOTALLY UNPUNISHED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Mono County Judge Edward Forstenzer fined Nevada farmers $5,000 for 
destroying a trophy trout stream last week, he went as far as the law allowed. 
</P>
<P>
A $1,000 fine on each of the five misdemeanor citations -- four from the state 
Fish and Game Code -- amounted to the maximum penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of the jury's verdict was that the Walker River Irrigation District 
had rights to the water in Bridgeport Reservoir but didn't have the right to 
draw it off in such a way as to destroy the East Walker River fishery, which is 
what happened in September of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Forstenzer also ordered the district to run a 400-cubic-feet-per-second flow 
for 14 days to flush out silt in the stream and to maintain a 30-c.f.s. minimum 
flow year-round to prevent icing. 
</P>
<P>
Since the defendant was an entity and not an individual or individuals, the law 
did not allow for jail time. 
</P>
<P>
Forstenzer, himself a fisherman with a reputation as a conservationist, agreed 
with angling interests and Mono County District Attorney Stan Eller, who 
prosecuted the case, that the maximum penalties he imposed weren't strong 
enough to have a punitive effect. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Edmondson, Region 5 Manager for CalTrout, says his group will push to 
change that and also to increase fines for similar violations. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to make the fines commensurate with the action," Edmondson said. 
"Society wants these abusers punished. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) we're pleased that this is a victory. We've never won a case like this 
before. It sends a very strong message." 
</P>
<P>
The Committee to Ban Gill Nets -- in conjunction with Cortez Yacht Charters of 
Lemon Grove and Aames Travel of Irvine -- is auctioning a fishing trip to Cabo 
San Lucas in an attempt to raise money to stop the controversial practice of 
gill-netting off the Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Bids must be submitted to the committee (P.O. Box 2323, Cypress, Calif., 90630) 
by March 1, with the highest bidder winning a three-night stay at the Melia 
Cabo Hotel, four days of fishing aboard the 32-foot Melisa, with an 
English-speaking captain, and round-trip air fare. 
</P>
<P>
The bidding will start at $1,300 and all will be kept secret until the winner 
is announced. Estimated value of the prize is $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is also accepting donations and urges the public to get involved 
in its petition drive to put an initiative on the November ballot. Copies can 
be obtained by calling (714) 828-9269.

The Wildlife Waystation in San Fernando, a haven for injured and displaced wild 
animals and birds, is an official charity of the Los Angeles Marathon March 4. 
The Waystation is seeking runners who will run for pledges. Details: (818)

San Diego long-range: The Polaris Supreme returned from a 16-day trip to the 
Revillagigedo Islands Saturday with its 18 passengers having caught 152 
yellowfin tuna, 187 wahoo and 149 grouper. Armin Loepfe of San Diego topped the 
list with a 235-pound yellowfin. 
</P>
<P>
Cabo San Lucas: Rough seas that cooled the striped marlin fishing have calmed 
and fishing has been slowly improving, according to Darrell Primrose of Tortuga 
Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose said hotel boats are averaging one striper a boat per day and that 
fishing for dorado, roosterfish and pargo has improved. 
</P>
<P>

The oil booms were lifted Monday, and the Newport Bay sportfishing landings -- 
Davey's Locker and Newport Landing, shut down since Feb. 8 -- are back in full 
operation. . . . Fred Hall's Western Fishing Tackle and Boat Show will be held 
Feb. 28-March 4 at the the Long Beach Convention Center. . . . Those interested 
in working in an outdoor environment are alerted to the 352-page third edition 
of the National Parks Trade Journal, a guide to employers at parks, ski 
resorts, lodges and organizations worldwide. The guide is available , at 
$14.50, from the journal at P.O. Box 2221, Wawona Station, Yosemite National 
Park, Calif., 95389. . . . . Irvine and Santa Ana Lakes will receive six 
18-pound rainbows each Thursday morning as part of a campaign to break the lake 
records. The trout are "triploids," sterile hybrids. The Irvine record is 14 
pounds,10 ounces, Santa Ana's 16-11. Manager Steve Miller said anyone catching 
a record fish can have it mounted free of charge. The lakes also got 3 1/2 tons 
of rainbow plants last week and are due for another 3 1/2 tons Thursday.

NHL ROUNDUP;

<P>
PENGUINS COUNTER LOSS WITH A WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Pittsburgh Penguins have been hearing for several days that with Mario 
Lemieux lost probably for the rest of the season, they figure to fall into the 
Patrick Division cellar. 
</P>
<P>
In their first game since Lemieux left for Los Angeles and a month of therapy, 
the Penguins gave no sign they intend to fold. 
</P>
<P>
John Cullen and defenseman Paul Coffey took up the slack and led the Penguins 
to a 6-4 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers Tuesday night at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen had three goals and Coffey had four assists as the Penguins rallied to 
pull within one point of the division-leading New York teams, the Islanders and 
the Rangers. They are five points ahead of the Flyers, who are tied for last 
place. 
</P>
<P>
There is some hope that if the Penguins are one of the four teams in the 
division to qualify for postseason play, Lemieux will rejoin them. Lemieux, 
suffering from a herniated disk, will not undergo surgery at this time. He will 
undergo therapy and treatment under spine specialist Dr. Robert Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cullen scored twice in the middle of the first period, Philadelphia 
led, 3-2, before Coffey set up Tony Tanti and Kevin Stevens for goals that put 
Pittsburgh ahead to stay late in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, who beat the New York Rangers in overtime Wednesday night when 
Lemieux's scoring streak ended at 46 consecutive games, are 2-1-1 since Lemieux 
went out. He played only briefly in that game before the pain was too much. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to moan about the loss of Mario," Coffey said. "We all have to 
play a little harder and we will do all right. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 19 games left and, I figure if we can win 10 of them we will make the 
playoffs. We'll miss Mario, but we are still a capable team." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Paul Holmgren of the Flyers said he thought the Penguins played a more 
solid game without Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 8, St. Louis 3 -- It was a big night at St. Louis for another Lemieux, 
Jocelyn (no relation). 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux, a former No. 1 draft pick of the Blues, had his first NHL hat trick as 
the Blackhawks took a four-point lead over the Blues in the Norris Division. He 
scored only 19 goals previously. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues, with a chance to move into a tie for the lead, led, 2-1, after a 
period. But Lemieux scored his eighth goal of the season 17 seconds after the 
faceoff. He scored again at 4:14 and the rout was underway. At 6:30 Lemieux 
completed his hat trick and Chicago led, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Jacques Cloutier had to face only 17 shots in winning his 16th game 
and stretching the Blackhawks' lead to four points. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Mike Hartman scored at 2:06 of overtime for the Sabres 
at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, unbeaten in their previous six home games, led, 3-2, until Scott 
Arniel tied the game midway through the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 4, Vancouver 2 -- The Oilers regained first place in the Smythe 
Division with this victory at Vancouver. With 72 points, the Oilers lead 
Calgary by a point. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Calgary 3 -- Wes Walz, in his second NHL game, had his first goal and 
assist at Calgary as the Bruins knocked the Flames out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The win improved the Bruins to 36-21-5, best in the league and kept them three 
points ahead of Buffalo in the Adams Division. DAN HAFNER

Gino Dippolito will be working his sixth Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star 
game tonight, most for any referee. Dippolito, the league's senior official, 
was on hand for the first MISL game in 1978 and for the first All-Star game in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is booed by fans here, he is considered among the most consistent 
referees in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what they say," he said. "I just go out there and do my best, but I do 
make mistakes, though I'll never make another mistake to make up for the first 
one. That would just be two mistakes instead of one." 
</P>
<P>
The call he remembers best in his previous All-Star games was a handball he 
called against Steve Zungul in the fourth quarter of the 1983 All-Star game in 
Kansas City that nullified a goal by Zungul, who already had a goal and an 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably took the MVP away from him," Dippolito said. "But it was the right 
call." 
</P>
<P>
The West eventually won in overtime, but the Most Valuable Player voting was 
done before the game ended. The award went to Memphis' Stan Stamenkovic, who 
scored four goals for the East. It was the first MVP award given to a player on 
the losing team. 
</P>
<P>
DALLAS FORWARD TATU has 41 goals this season, which means he has thrown his 
shirt to the crowd that many times. He doesn't spend a lot of time worrying 
about what it's costing management, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much it costs," he says. "I don't pay." 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't mind having a fresh jersey every game. 
</P>
<P>
"When you wash your shirt year around it doesn't smell good all the way," he 
says. "I don't have to worry about that. The equipment manager doesn't have to 
wash mine." 
</P>
<P>
MISL COMMISSIONER EARL FOREMAN has been talking with the players' union to work 
an agreement allowing teams the option of playing outdoor soccer this summer. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only St. Louis owner Milan Mandaric has shown interest. 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric said he does not intend to repeat the mistakes of the Sockers, who 
played outdoors in the early 1980s in the North American Soccer League and ran 
up a debt that eventually forced former owner Bob Bell to sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not trying to start a new outdoor league," he said. "I see it as a 
community project to promote the game and keep the players together." 
</P>
<P>
WEST COACH RON NEWMAN poked fun at his two goalkeepers, Slobo Ilijevski (St. 
Louis) and Krys Sobieski (Dallas) at Tuesday's media luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of experience in goal," he said. "A lot of experience. Many, 
many years of experience. Most of the players are coming up to me and asking, 
'How much of a bonus do we get?' but the two goalies came up and asked about 
their pensions." 
</P>
<P>
Sobieski, 40, has been in the league since 1980 when he played for the 
Pittsburgh Spirit. Ilijevski, 39, started the same year with the St. Louis 
Steamers.

<P>
Ron Newman gets worked up when the subject is soccer, particularly World Cup 
soccer. Sometimes, when he gets worked up, his tongue gets lost somewhere 
between his cheek and reality. 
</P>
<P>
Finding himself surrounded by Major Indoor Soccer League All-Stars at a Tuesday 
luncheon, Newman got worked up. 
</P>
<P>
Having already coached six of these affairs, you would think he might be a 
little blase. Except this one is different. This one, for the first time, is at 
home in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Newman has never been one to sidestep a soap box, and here was one on his 
doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two players, representing the eight MISL teams, will participate in this 
11th annual all-star game at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is Newman's notion that they should represent a lot more than their 
MISL teams. 
</P>
<P>
He would like to see them represent the United States in the World Cup, at 
least the ones with U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"The best American players are in the Major Indoor Soccer League," Newman said. 
"The most professional players. The most competitive players. The most finely 
tuned players." 
</P>
<P>
But those aren't the players the U.S. will send to Italy this year for World 
Cup play. It is, of course, a matter of opinion whether these players are, in 
fact, the best players in the U.S., but Newman has never been shy about 
expressing his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Given that there is a chance these are the best players in the U.S., in that 
case making Newman's opinion reality, we then stumble across a bit of 
tongue-in-cheek fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
You see, Newman has this idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to take the best MISL players and challenge the National Team," he 
said. "Best of three games. Winner goes to the World Cup. You think they'd take 
that on?" 
</P>
<P>
He had that mischievous twinkle in his eye that told you he knew and you knew 
the answer to the question. Sure, the National Team would jump at the 
opportunity to play against the MISL and take a chance on not being the 
National Team any more, just like Buster Douglas can't wait to get back into a 
ring with Mike Tyson. The difference is that Douglas will eventually have to . 
. . but make a few million in the process. 
</P>
<P>
What nettles Newman, to be sure, is any suggestion that the best indoor players 
are in any way inferior to outdoor players. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I've never heard indoor soccer players with anything bad to say 
about the outdoor game," he said, "but I can't say the reverse is true. Outdoor 
players don't know the fine points of the indoor game and resent it because 
they don't understand it. They fear what they don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The point should not be lost that the best indoor players did not grow up 
playing in barns or phone booths. The best indoor players learned the game 
outdoors, most of them excelling at the outdoor game. However, should one care 
to make a living as a soccer player in this section of the New World, it better 
be indoors. 
</P>
<P>
That being the case, it would appear that the best players hereabouts must be 
the ones playing the Americanized indoor version of the world's favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, having made his statement of opinion and then ventured wildly into the 
fantasy land of a challenge match, was ready to roll onward. 
</P>
<P>
"With the National Team," he said, "you have to take the players playing in the 
most competitive league available. You have to get them where they are trying 
to win a place on a team or win a game or win a ball. I don't think (our 
National Team) has the best players and they're not playing in the most 
competitive atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
If Newman had not been right, it would be tempting to say that all of his 
bluster was a means of building up the caliber of players who will be appearing 
in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
But he was right. 
</P>
<P>
The best soccer players in the United States will be the ones at the Sports 
Arena tonight, albeit this is not an occasion to bring out intense 
competitiveness. An All-Star game in indoor soccer is like an All-Star game in 
anything else, which is to say a free-lance showcase for individual skills. 
</P>
<P>
However, if these guys were meshed onto one team, I would like their chances in 
a challenge match against the incumbent National Team. 
</P>
<P>
Just because it will never happen doesn't mean it shouldn't.

Professional Sports for 500, please. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is: It was first contested between the Atlantic and Central 
Divisions and last time pitted Dallas against the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
Any three Jeopardy contestants, yes, any three, would draw a blank with that 
one, but the correct answer, in the form of a question, is "What is the Major 
Indoor Soccer League All-Star game?" 
</P>
<P>
What is it? Well, let's see: 
</P>
<P>
1979-80 
</P>
<P>
In its second year of existence, the MISL went from a six-team, one-division 
format to a 10-team, two-division setup and celebrated with its first-ever 
All-Star game. The Central outscored the Atlantic, 9-4, a surprise considering 
seven of the league's top 10 scorers played for the Atlantic Division. Oh, the 
Central's goalie, Houston's Mick Poole, who faced 41 shots and made 26 saves in 
the game, finished seventh in goals-against average that year at 5.29. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Branko Segota, then an 18-year-old, two-year "veteran" with the New 
York Arrows, played in his first MISL All-Star game. He assisted on a Fred 
Grgurev goal. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 16,892 at the Checkerdome in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
1980-81 
</P>
<P>
The league once again expanded, this time to 12 teams and three divisions (the 
Western was added). Players from two Central teams (Chicago Horizon and St. 
Louis Steamers) played for the Western squad while players from the Cleveland 
Force and Buffalo Stallions were adopted by the Atlantic, creating the Eastern 
team. The West prevailed, 8-5. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Adrian Brooks, a rookie midfielder with Denver, scored two goals for 
the West and was named Most Valuable Player. Brooks stayed in the league only 
three more seasons and was never among the league's top 20 scorers, the only 
All-Star game MVP with such a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 13,170 at Madison Square Garden in New York. 
</P>
<P>
1981-82 
</P>
<P>
Now with 14 teams, the league realigned into the Eastern and Western divisions, 
seven teams in each, and for the first time had a true East-West clash in the 
All-Star game. The West won again, 9-5, behind Tony Glavin's five goals and 
two-assists. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Slobo Ilijevski made his first All-Star game appearance. The St. Louis 
Steamers goalie, playing for the West, faced 31 shots in the first half and 
allowed only one goal, making six saves. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 13,426 at the Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
1982-83 
</P>
<P>
Still with two divisions of seven teams, but with three teams from the rival 
outdoor North American Soccer League (including the Sockers) replacing three 
that folded, the league showcased its top talent in another East-West showdown. 
The West toppled the East, 6-5, in overtime. Kim Roentved of Wichita kicked in 
the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Although the West won the game, an Eastern player, Memphis' Stan 
Stamenkovic, took home the Most Valuable Player trophy for scoring four goals. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 14,289 at Kemper Arena in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
1983-84 
</P>
<P>
For the first time the MISL lost teams, but only because the three NASL teams 
were forced back into that league. Now with six teams in each division, the 
East got its first victory, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Stamenkovic, who had moved over to the Baltimore Blast, followed up his 
four-goal performance in the previous year's All-Star game, with a four-assist 
showing one and again was voted MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 16,312 at The Arena in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
1984-85 
</P>
<P>
Back to 14 teams with the addition of four NASL clubs. The All-Star game 
featured 10 players from what was considered a talent-laden NASL, yet it was 
Stamenkovic who stole the show, and his third MVP award, with three goals and 
two assists. Again, Stamenkovic received the honor in a losing effort, the West 
won, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Instead of giving the MVP to a player on the losing side, the award 
could have gone to one of three Sockers on the winning squad: Steve Zungul 
(three goals, one assist), Branko Segota (one goal, three assists) or goalie 
Zoltan Toth (who faced 21 shots and made 11 saves). 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 17,863 at the Richfield Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
1985-86 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the league shrink again (to 12 teams), but so too did goal 
production in the All-Star game. The final was 5-3, West. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Only 59 shots were taken in the game, by far the lowest total up to 
that time. It was the first time less than 65 shots had been fired. There had 
been at least 74 taken on four previous occasions and at least 90 in two of 
those games. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 12,456 at the Chicago Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
1986-87 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern team won for only the second time, 6-5, in another overtime. 
Baltimore's Mike Stankovic scored the only sixth-attacker goal in All-Star 
history with 20 seconds remaining in regulation to force the extra period, and 
Kai Haaskivi, who earlier had an assist, got the game-winner just 32 seconds 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- This time the MVP voting was done after the tie was unknotted and was 
given to the guy who did the untangling -- Haaskivi of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 15,893 in The Forum in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
1987-88 
</P>
<P>
In the last game between East and West, the West won for the sixth time (in 
eight games), 9-3. Preki of Tacoma, with three goals, was the MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- Steve Zungul set a record by playing in his eighth All-Star game (it 
likely would have been his ninth were he not with San Diego in the NASL in 
1983-84). He scored a goal and assisted on two others. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 17,251 at The Tacoma Dome. 
</P>
<P>
1988-89 
</P>
<P>
Down to seven teams after four franchises folded during a tumultuous 
off-season, the All-Star game mismatched the host Dallas Sidekicks against the 
best of the rest. No need to print who won; the final was 8-1. With a two-goal 
performance, Preki was the MVP for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Note -- In last year's contest, both teams combined for only 47 shots (there 
were a total of 91 taken in that first year). 
</P>
<P>
Attendance -- 10,435 at Reunion Arena in Dallas.

MIRA MESA IS STRIKE THREE ON FALLBROOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fallbrook High lost its big man -- senior Travis Teagle -- a day before the 
regular season final. Strike one. 
</P>
<P>
Its best outside guy -- sophomore Chris Miller -- had a 103 degree temperature. 
Strike two. 
</P>
<P>
Its opponent Tuesday night in the first round of the San Diego Section Division 
I boys' basketball playoffs -- Mira Mesa -- executed a terrific game plan to 
near perfection. Strike three. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook is out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa, with a 66-52 victory at home, advances to the second round where it 
will play No. 1 Sweetwater, an easy winner over Granite Hills. The Marauders 
(18-8) have won five in a row. Fallbrook (16-11) lost its last four. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa Coach Tim Cunningham knew of Fallbrook's condition and hoped his team 
would not relent. He need not have worried. 
</P>
<P>
Mixing things up at both ends of the court, Mira Mesa kept the Warriors on 
their heels nearly the entire game. Cunningham deployed three different zone 
defenses and a full-court press and got balanced scoring on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa's Shed Smith made four of four three-pointers and scored all 14 of 
his points in the first quarter. "I just hit my first and had confidence after 
that," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Ziegler had eight points in the second quarter and 10 in the fourth to 
finish with a game-high 18. Cal Chatham added 11 and J.J. Rowlett and Chris 
Crane nine apiece. 
</P>
<P>
A weary Miller, who was averaging 18.6 points, had nine points in the first 
half and zero in the second. Senior forward Darnell Lee picked up the slack 
with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Teagle, who suffered a knee injury Thursday in 
practice, was dearly missed as Mira Mesa controlled the inside game. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give them credit," Cunningham said. "(Lee) posted up well and 
made some real nice soft shots." 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders trailed just once, 8-7, five minutes into the game. Mira Mesa 
scored the first seven points, Fallbrook the next eight, and Mira Mesa the next 
10. The Marauders led by nine at the end of the first quarter and eight at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook rallied late in the third and early in the fourth to pull within, 
44-42, but Mira Mesa quickly regained a 10-point advantage. "We made a run, and 
I thought we had them for a while," Fallbrook Coach Russell Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
Free throws played a big part, too. Fallbrook went to the line seven times and 
missed the first one each time. It finished five for 13. Mira Mesa made 16 or 
21, including 10 or 12 in the fourth quarter. JIM LINDGREN

WEDBUSH SEEKS BIGGER ROLE IN GREAT AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wedbush Corp., a Los Angeles-based financial services corporation that holds a 
17% share in Great American Bank, wants federal regulators to drop guidelines 
that limit its management role in the San Diego-based S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush, which has held one board seat since 1986, wants additional 
representation, along with permission to acquire more than 25% of Great 
American's common shares. 
</P>
<P>
In its filing, Wedbush asks the federal Office of Thrift Supervision to 
eliminate guidelines established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1986, 
when Wedbush was allowed to acquire up to 24.9% of the S&amp;L's common stock. 
Regulators limited Wedbush to one board seat and prohibited the company from 
trying to take over the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Great American, which in 1986 asked regulators to prohibit Wedbush from 
acquiring additional stock, has "no present intention to oppose the 
application," a Great American spokesman, Brian Luscomb, said Tuesday. "That's 
the right of any shareholder or any investor of his size. We don't plan to 
oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush Corp. filed the request because the S&amp;L is "at a crucial juncture," 
Edward W. Wedbush, president of the Wedbush Corp., said in a statement released 
Tuesday. "Wedbush Corp. needs the flexibility to suggest and implement changes 
in the direction of Great American to the same extent as the largest 
shareholder of any publicly owned company." 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush's regulatory filing was "related" to the $123.9-million net loss that 
Great American reported Friday for the year ended Dec. 31, said Philip J. 
LoBue, Wedbush senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Great American, which has been substantially hurt by Arizona's ongoing real 
estate slump, also reported a $59.3-million net loss for the fourth quarter 
ended Dec. 31, and said it would not pay a fourth-quarter dividend. The 
$123.9-million loss was the S&amp;L's first annual net loss since it became a 
publicly traded company in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Financial industry analysts on Tuesday were uncertain about Wedbush Corp.'s 
motive in the filing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it means," said Michael Abrahams, an S&amp;L industry 
analyst with Bateman Eichler Hill Richards in Los Angeles. "Maybe he was just 
trying to jack the price of the stock up." Great American closed at $5, up 
$.125, on Tuesday. Just six months ago, the stock was trading at $12 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can think of is that he feels he doesn't have his finger on 
the button, that (management) is running the show and he's got no input," said 
Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "But I 
don't know what he'd do different." 
</P>
<P>
Another analyst suggested that Wedbush is tired of being ignored. "In the past, 
Great American has been willing to take his money but not his advice," said the 
analyst, who knows top executives in both organizations. "Maybe in the future, 
they won't get his money, but they'll have to take his advice." 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush Corp. hopes to strengthen Great American's business plan through the 
"addition of some independent board members," LoBue said. "We would like 
Wedbush Corp. to be in a position to . . . give direction to Great American's 
short-term, as well as its long-term, strategies." 
</P>
<P>
Wedbush, which "might" increase its 17% share to the 24.9% ceiling, has "no 
current intention" of exceeding that level, LoBue said. 
</P>
<P>
LoBue said that a review by the Office of Thrift Supervision would take at 
least "several months, given the higher priorities" facing the agency 
elsewhere.

CHEVRON TO CUT 800 JOBS, SELL SOME OIL, GAS ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chevron Corp., the oil industry's sluggish giant, announced a sweeping 
restructuring of its U.S. oil and gas division Tuesday that will cut 800 to 
1,000 jobs and sell off $700 million in assets as part of a long-term strategy 
to bolster financial performance. 
</P>
<P>
The moves will cost Chevron $25 million to $30 million in charges in the first 
quarter of 1990, primarily for employees' severance packages, but will 
eventually save the company $140 million to $160 million a year in salaries and 
operating costs, Chevron spokesman Michael W. Libbey said from the company's 
San Francisco headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally applauded the planned restructuring by the nation's 
third-largest energy company, whose financial performance has trailed that of 
its major competitors due in part to high costs, low efficiencies and top-heavy 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, management now sees that they need to restructure and that there's 
tremendous potential value to be unlocked," said Frederick P. Leuffer, an 
industry analyst with C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York and one 
of Chevron's tougher critics. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's restructuring of its U.S. exploration and production operation is 
part of a longstanding industry trend to streamline such operations and focus 
more attention overseas. Unocal Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Mobil Oil 
Corp. and British Petroleum have already undertaken similar downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's moves may signal disenchantment with domestic oil prospects in light 
of its frustration in trying to produce oil off the coast of Santa Barbara 
County through the Point Arguello project, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron, the lead partner in a consortium of 18 oil companies, took a 
$445-million charge in the fourth quarter of 1989 on its share of a total 
$2-billion investment in the project, which sits idle as county officials 
debate how to transport the project's oil. Partly as a result of the charge, 
Chevron's 1989 earnings plummeted to $251 million from nearly $1.8 billion in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
It is also unlikely that Chevron will be allowed to drill any time soon in the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where it has a large interest, because of 
heightened environmental concerns in the wake of the Exxon Valdez and Orange 
County oil tanker spills. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's announcement, Chevron's stock fell 62.5 cents a share to $69.25 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring, which grew out of a study completed this month, is part of a 
continuing effort to improve Chevron's stock price and its return to 
shareholders. Some details: 
</P>
<P>
* Between 800 and 1,000 jobs will be cut this year, half through sale of 
assets. That includes middle and senior management jobs, as well as all 450 
positions at Chevron's exploration and production offices in San Ramon, Calif. 
In subsequent years, more jobs will be cut through attrition, early retirements 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Chevron will accelerate its sales of less-profitable oil and gas properties 
in the United States, auctioning off more than $700 million worth of properties 
in the next two years, or about 1,000 of Chevron's 1,700 fields. The fields, 
many acquired in the Gulf Oil merger in 1984, represent only about 11% of 
Chevron's total daily production of oil and gas, Libbey said. Chevron sold 
about $210 million in assets in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
* The company will eliminate several layers of management, phase out three 
regional offices in San Ramon, Houston and New Orleans and consolidate 
operations under seven business units accountable for their own profits and 
losses directly to company headquarters. Also, production operations now 
managed in Ventura will be moved to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
The move should cut Chevron's high cost of producing oil. In 1989, it spent 
about $6.40 to find and produce a barrel of oil, more than any of its major 
competitors. The restructuring, scheduled to be completed by Oct. 1, will help 
Chevron achieve its goal in the next three to five years of cutting that cost 
to $5.25 per barrel in 1990 dollars, comparable to the costs of its 
competitors, said Leonard Porter, Chevron's Western regional general manager 
for production. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron's Chairman Kenneth T. Derr is scheduled to discuss details of the 
restructuring in meetings with financial analysts in New York today. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron produced about 2.6 million barrels of oil and gas a day in 1989, 
equally divided between U.S. and foreign production. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring does not appear to be a reaction to Pennzoil Co.'s 
acquisition of an 8.8% stake in Chevron last year. Since that purchase, Chevron 
has sued Pennzoil and strengthened its defenses against a possible takeover.

JACK SMITH: 1940: THE WORLD ACCORDING TO 17 EIGHTH-GRADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1940 the 17 eighth-grade pupils of the Malaga Cove Intermediate School, 
Palos Verdes Estates, wrote a letter about their times to be read by the 
eighth-grade class of 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The Class of 1965 in turn wrote a letter for the Class of 1990, and that class 
is now preparing one to be read by the Class of 2015. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, several members of the classes of 1940 and 1965 will meet at the 
school with the current class to talk about past, present and future. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Carl L. Lane, the principal, has sent me the letters written in 1940 
and 1965, and I will attempt, first, to summarize the world of 1940 as it was 
seen by the members of that class. 
</P>
<P>
Life on the peninsula in 1940 was uncrowded, comfortable, slow-paced -- on the 
surface, idyllic. "We all have very beautiful homes which are mostly 
Mediterranean or ranch-type architecture, and are furnished accordingly. . . . 
But in many of the homes in the Point Vicente area, where there is still no 
electricity, the Japanese farmers used old-fashioned stoves, kerosene lamps, 
and battery-run radios." Five of the signatures were Japanese names. (They 
evidently were destined to spend the war years in internment camps.) 
</P>
<P>
The school was on nine acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, only a block 
from the ocean. It was near the pretty town plaza with its Italian fountain at 
the center. There were only 270 houses in the year-old city, and 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The closest movie theater was in Redondo Beach. There was only one television 
set in town, at La Venta Inn. Each home had one or two radio sets. "On the 
other hand," the letter said, "we read more books." 
</P>
<P>
Among their favorite books: "Tom Sawyer," "Treasure Island," "Huckleberry 
Finn," "Pinocchio," "Bambi," "Two Years Before the Mast," "The Mysterious 
Island" and "Northwest Passage." 
</P>
<P>
Riding and swimming were favorite sports. None of the pupils owned horses, but 
they could rent them. "The boys belong to the Boy Scouts and the girls to the 
Campfire Girls." 
</P>
<P>
The pupils were grateful for their freedom and conscious of the tyranny in 
Europe and Asia. "Here, we feel safe, and, though we do not know the horrors of 
war, we can imagine enough to make us want our country to keep away and out of 
the conflict as long as possible. . . . Our sympathies are with England and 
France, but we haven't entered the war, and nothing has happened yet that makes 
it necessary for us to make that move." (Pearl Harbor was 18 months away.) 
</P>
<P>
They were concerned by unemployment (10 million), the school dropout rate, 
poverty (President Roosevelt had said one-third of the nation was "ill-housed, 
ill-fed, and ill-clothed"), and crime, on which the nation spent more than on 
education. "We feel that criminals are made, not born, and that if children 
could have the right homes, and education, and a fair chance in life, many of 
this nation's problems could be solved." 
</P>
<P>
They were concerned about the waste of resources and destruction of the 
environment. They were excited by the dawning of the technological revolution, 
which had already brought such promising synthetics as nylon, Bakelite and 
cellophane; "streamlined" railroad trains that could travel 100 m.p.h; and 
airplanes that could carry 30 passengers at 200 m.p.h. Air travel was becoming 
fast, convenient and safe. 
</P>
<P>
President Roosevelt was about to run for an unprecedented third term, and many 
of the class were for him: "With the war as menacing as it is, (he) should 
remain in office." 
</P>
<P>
Though the letter seems rather too well-informed and sophisticated, and the 
writing too error-free to be entirely the work of eighth-graders, keep in mind 
that the class had "spent much time this year upon the study of English 
grammar," and in social studies had read not only text books but also 
"newspapers, magazines and reference books, and listened to radio broadcasts." 
</P>
<P>
In closing, they said to the Class of 1965: "When you read this most of us will 
be about 38 years old. . . . We, a class of eighth-graders, have tried as well 
as we could to make the acquaintance of a class of boys and girls who have not 
yet been born. To you we make a promise -- that we will try to leave this a 
happier world for our having lived."

CARRINGTON HAS FUN AT LE CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday evening at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, the 24-year-old drummer Terri Lyne 
Carrington informed her audience that she and her fellow musicians were just 
having fun and that the music would be non-electric. "I hope you're not 
disappointed," she added. 
</P>
<P>
No apology was called for. The quartet set its sights higher than Carrington 
did on her recent album. There were no pop songs, no vocals, no commercial 
concessions. The outcome was a dazzling performance by four brilliant young 
musicians (in this company, pianist Patrice Rushen at 35 seemed like a 
veteran). 
</P>
<P>
Carrington announced that she would play some "obscure standards," though to 
most of the crowd such vehicles as "Solar" by Miles Davis and "Oleo" by Sonny 
Rollins could hardly have been unfamiliar. The ballads, Charles Lloyd's "Forest 
Flower" and Horace Silver's "Peace," also are well-enough known to most jazz 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
These tunes provided perfect settings for Greg Osby, whose alto sax was tough, 
fluent and never derivative; for Rushen, who too rarely has a chance to stretch 
out on a straight-ahead jazz basis and, most remarkably, for Brian Bromberg, 
whose technique on the upright bass is as original as Stanley Jordan's on the 
guitar. His left hand at times performed duties normally reserved for the right 
hand, and vice versa; sometimes both at once, producing lines and chords and 
rhythmic convolutions that almost defied belief. 
</P>
<P>
Carrington's drums kept a firm hold, her time feeling impeccable, her drive and 
power catalytically irresistible. Once in a while, her offbeat bass drum 
accents tended to dominate excessively, like so many thunder claps, but overall 
she sustained the unity of this virtually new group (Bromberg had never worked 
with her before). 
</P>
<P>
Carrington's idea of "just having fun" deserves recorded preservation. One can 
only hope that her next CD will be fashioned along these unswervingly 
mettlesome lines.LEONARD FEATHER

Berlin Winners: "Music Box" by Greek director Costa-Gavras and "Skylarks on the 
String" by Czechoslovakia's Jiri Menzel shared the top Golden Bear prize at the 
40th Berlin Film Festival on Tuesday. The unusual joint award reflected the 
festival's dedication to blooming East-West rapprochement. "Coming Out," an 
East German film about a young man's repressed homosexuality, won the 
festival's overall Silver Bear. BETH KLEID

Liege May Sell Picasso: The debt-ridden city of Liege, Belgium, is considering 
the sale of a Picasso masterpiece to keep its museums open. 
</P>
<P>
"Either we sell this Picasso or we have to close a dozen museums for lack of 
funds," culture alderman Hector Magotte told the daily newspaper Het Belang van 
Limburg. The city council hopes to make $57 million from the sale of the 1903 
painting of the Soler family, a masterpiece of Picasso's "Blue Period." The 
council will make a decision on the sale next month. BETH KLEID

JAZZ NOTES: COMPOSER GRANT FOR BENNY CARTER, 82; 'JAZZ GOES TO SCHOOL' GETS 
UNDER WAY

Tally up another kudo for the indefatigable Benny Carter. 
</P>
<P>
The 82-year-old composer/saxophonist/trumpeter, who just last week was in New 
York to conduct his orchestra at the "Hearts for Ella" American Heart Assn. 
benefit at Avery Fisher Hall, is one of 18 jazz artists, and the sole Los 
Angeles resident, to receive a grant from the 1989 Meet the 
Composer/Rockefeller Foundation/AT&amp;T Jazz Program. 
</P>
<P>
The grants, which total $283,000 and were announced recently, pair the 
composers with a sponsoring music and performing arts organization for which 
the composers create original works and then serve as artists-in-residence to 
oversee the work's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the results of these creative collaborations, and to 
continuing our support of Meet the Composer in this initiative to stimulate 
exchanges between jazz composers and artists working in other art forms," 
stated Alberta Arthurs, director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Arts and 
Humanities Division, in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1989, was awarded $15,000 
to write two 20-minute pieces to feature vibraphonists Lionel Hampton and Milt 
Jackson. The commissions, sponsored by the Lincoln Center of the Performing 
Arts in New York, will be debuted at a later, unscheduled date with the 
16-piece Classical Jazz Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Other recipients included pianist Billy Taylor, who will write a 15-20 minute 
work to be performed by his trio and the Juilliard String Quartet on a national 
tour; saxophonist Julius Hemphill, who will concoct a 45-minute work for IMP 
ORK, a 30-piece improvisational orchestra, also to be performed nationally; 
guitarist Kenny Burrell, who is currently appearing at the Indigo Jazz Club in 
Compton, who will write a work featuring the Boys Choir of Harlem; and pianist 
Stanley Cowell, who will compose a 15-20 minute jazz piano concerto to be 
performed with the Toledo (Ohio) Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Composer was founded in 1974 to foster the creation, performance and 
recording of works by contemporary American composers and to develop new 
audiences for these works. The group sponsors over 4,000 such performances a 
year. Information: (212) 787-3601. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, whose latest LP is "Cookin' at Carlos 1" (Musicmasters), can be heard 
leading a superlative mainstream band -- pianist Hank Jones, bassist Ray Brown 
and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and singer Sylvia Sims are among the members -- 
on NPR's American Jazz Radio Festival, which airs locally on KLON-FM (88.1), 
March 2, 10 p.m. The group plays such Carter classics as "Key Largo" and "Easy 
Money." 
</P>
<P>
The International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation (IOAJA) has kicked off its third 
annual "Jazz Goes to School," a seven-week program that brings jazz and jazz 
history to students in Los Angeles elementary and junior high schools. 
Conceived and conducted by drummer Washington Rucker, JGTS utilizes various 
musicians to demonstrate subjects such as "The Blues," "Boogie Woogie &amp; 
Swing to Be-Bop" and "The Future of Jazz" to enthusiastic youngsters at schools 
that included La Salle Elementary, Foshay Junior High and 54th Street 
Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is really progressing and each year we increase the size and the 
scope of it," said Ruth Roby, IOAJA's executive director. "And the kids love 
it. The letters we get from them are incredible. A lot of them say things like, 
'We thought jazz would be old folk's music, but we like it.' And we get high 
praise from teachers and principals as to what it does for the children." 
Information: (213) 469-5589. 
</P>
<P>
Any discographers out there looking for work? G.K. Hall &amp; Co. is 
establishing a 17-volume "Jazz Discography Series" and is seeking contributions 
from published discographers, or those with substantive works in progress. 
These ardent folks will be asked to ferret out such facts as dates and 
locations of recordings, listing of all released and unreleased tracks, 
identification of soloists, etc., for recording sessions by the likes of Herbie 
Hancock, Jaco Pastorius, Paul Chambers, Sonny Rollins, Artie Shaw and 
Thelonious Monk. Information: Gary Carner, G.K. Hall Jazz Discography Series, 
18 Becket Road, Belmont, Mass. 02178-3905. 
</P>
<P>
The thumping two-beat sounds of Dixieland and traditional jazz will be served 
up at the 11th annual Pismo Beach Mardi Gras Jazz Festival, being held 
Friday-Sunday. Tickets are $30 for all concerts. Information: (800) 443-7778, 
(805) 773-4382.

HOOTERS: PAINFUL EARNESTNESS AT ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hooters' act is showing some stretch marks these days. The Philadelphia 
quintet is nothing if not talented, hard-working and well-meaning, but some 
wonder has gone out of the way these well-scrubbed rockers use "roots" 
instruments to spice up their polished, Midwest bar-band spiel. 
</P>
<P>
And their ever-increasing sense of Social Consciousness strains their tight, 
light pop fabric at the seams. 
</P>
<P>
Two sorts of painful earnestness were on display Monday at the Roxy. Reflecting 
those early years spent on the club circuit were their dated moves. Reflecting 
their subsequent maturation and concern were the topical references ("This one 
goes out to Nelson Mandela"), the obligatory swipe at organized religion, and a 
woeful closing sing-along of a Dylan standard ("Mr. Tambourine Man," with 
confused-looking guest Stevie Nicks as the Tambourine Lady). 
</P>
<P>
The mandolins and accordions and social awareness should make the music more 
human, but more often remind us how sterile much of it is. The Hooters were 
better off concocting such guilty pleasures as "And We Danced" and "Day by 
Day," both of which provided rapturous highlights Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Opening act Nuclear Valdez has a similar dubious achievement: They've written 
as silly a Lenny Bruce tribute as Bob Dylan's. But that and a few other 
youthful missteps aside, they're a pretty terrific rock 'n' roll band. Their 
sizzling, aching single "Summer" -- the best pop song ever written about the 
Cuban revolution? -- is a successful example of the sort of tune the Hooters 
keep going for. 
</P>
<P>
Both bands play tonight at the Bacchanal in San Diego, Friday at the Ventura 
Theatre, and Saturday and Sunday at the Coach House. CHRIS WILLMAN

THE MYTHIC MADNESS OF MICHAEL SARGENT'S 'I HATE!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playwright Michael Sargent is developing a mythic anti-hero for the '90s. The 
protagonist of "I Hate!" at the Cast Theatre is certainly a further blossoming 
of the central figure in Sargent's "Big Boy," presented by John Steppling's and 
Bob Glaudini's Heliogabalus company a couple of seasons ago at the Cast 
(Sargent emerged from Steppling's workshop). 
</P>
<P>
Sargent's mythic hero is young, monolithic, oblivious to the outside forces 
which shape his life, and revels in a state of undress which comments wryly on 
his intellectual impact on society. 
</P>
<P>
In "I Hate!" the blank-eyed figure is again, like Boy in the previous play, 
passively engaged in a way of life that eventually ends in self-destruction. 
After his three years in prison, his vindictive mother kicks him out of her 
home, and he rents a cheap room in the faded mansion of a faded silent screen 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Sargent's unfailing sense of humor has taken a glance at "Sunset Boulevard" for 
the set-up, along with a long look at "Sweet Bird of Youth" (the boy's name is 
Chance). The difference is that the faded star is Sanchez, Latin lover rival of 
Valentino. Sanchez, who claims Ramon Navarro was weird, wears a flimsy Oriental 
dress and is never without his parasol. And he's never without a hungry leer 
when Chance is within grabbing range. 
</P>
<P>
Maud, a drunken barfly, is the derelict Chance passes off as a nurse to help 
baby-sit Sanchez. She completes the unholy triumvirate as it spins itself into 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The wicked humor Sargent displayed in "Big Boy" is evident here. If the 
production isn't as striking as its predecessor, it might be because the 
playwright directed this one himself, while "Big Boy" was guided by Lee 
Kissman. Kissman is present in a subtle, quirky performance as Sanchez but the 
wit and originality in his staging of the earlier play is missing. Director 
Sargent takes playwright Sargent a little too seriously. 
</P>
<P>
But playwright Sargent has hit on something with his mythic character (played 
properly by Jason Reed like a puppy stunned at his first spanking for missing 
the papers). Chance is as strong a comment on the disenfranchised young male of 
the '90s as Sam Shepard's comic book pseudo cowboy was of the '60s. It's a 
kinky, unsettling image. 
</P>
<P>
Shawna Casey is also a little unsettling as sleazy Maud. She captures the 
thoughtless evil of the character without totally giving away her game too 
quickly. Tina Preston, who can make the most outlandish characterization seem 
perfectly normal, does so as both Chance's mother and Maud's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Courtenay Marvin's set and costumes and Don Preston's 1940s-tuned sound design 
blend in perfectly with the "Sunset Boulevard" ambience and have some of the 
humor of the writing. Sargent's mythic hero deserves more of that humor in the 
playwright's direction. 
</P>
<P>
At 800 N. El Centro Ave., Hollywood; Thursdays and Fridays,8 p.m.; ends March 
9. Tickets: $5; (213) 462-0265.

'A MOVEABLE FEAST' ON PBS VIEWS AMERICAN FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If "A Moveable Feast" were a restaurant, it would be a health food cafeteria. 
As you walked down the line, looking at a lot of dreary dishes that were 
supposed to be good for you, you'd think how much happier a hamburger would 
make you. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of this particular "Feast" (airing at 8 tonight on Channels 28 
and 15 under the "Smithsonian World" banner), it doesn't even turn out to be 
particularly good for you. 
</P>
<P>
This self-described "lively tour of American food culture" begins with a 
depiction of the Pilgrims. Some nice Indians (who look more like Gypsies) bring 
them oysters and teach them to plant corn. The Dutch drop by for dinner 
(bringing some cheese). It's all as exciting as a grade school audio-visual 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The next thing we know, we're riding the rails, and the announcer is telling us 
that "the railroad helped to carry us from an agricultural to an industrial 
society." There is a too-brief section on the Harvey Girls, suddenly we're 
eating fast food and then the McDonalds tell us how they invented the golden 
arches. And now on to power lunch at "21." 
</P>
<P>
The "21" segment is one of the high points, for it takes you right into the 
heart of the kitchen and gives you a sense of how a big restaurant produces 
food. Unfortunately, it's sandwiched between a puffy piece about what an 
important place "21" is and another about how the Air Force Academy manages to 
feed 5,000 cadets at the same time. (You'd probably rather not know.) 
</P>
<P>
The last segment of our food tour takes us to Berkeley's Chez Panisse -- and 
back to the land and a brief visit to the Chino Ranch. If you don't already 
know that this Rancho Santa Fe institution is where the country's best fruit 
and vegetables are being grown, it's a nice introduction and one that will make 
you want to jump into your car and rush right down to buy something for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
But first you've got to try to swallow the last few words of this particular 
"Feast." "We have wound up where we started," says the announcer, happily 
looking at the fresh-food movement -- and neatly overlooking a few minor 
environmental problems.

A LIGHTHEARTED EVENING WITH DICKENS' 'WOOMEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many women can you fit into one fast-moving show? An avalanche? A baker's 
dozen? 
</P>
<P>
A Dickens' dozen, if you ask Miriam Margolyes. That adds up to about 15 (give 
or take a woman) and is considerably more interesting than anything a baker 
might cook up. 
</P>
<P>
Margolyes, who received a lot of attention for her performance as Flora 
Finching in the 1988 film version of Dickens' "Little Dorrit," has since formed 
a professional alliance with the author, the results of which can be seen at 
the Tiffany Theatre under the title: "Wooman, Lovely Wooman, What a Sex You 
Are!" It's a comic collage of female portraits culled from the pages of the 
Dickens canon: Shy, sweet, eternally pubescent young things at the seemingly 
perpetual age of 17; bold, cold, formidable, odd or strange ones of any 
uncertain age whatever. 
</P>
<P>
Margolyes, who is herself short, round and impish, with expressive eyes, is not 
only tuned in to the author's mind, but to his libido. She presents these 
woomen (the spelling of choice, she tells us, in Dickens' day) with abundant 
personal footnotes. The footnotes elaborate on these ladies' peculiarities, as 
well as the peculiarities of the man who created them, modeling them loosely 
after the women in his life, with whom, it seems, he had a Dickens of a time. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the impression we are left with as we listen to Margolyes 
chattering along, feeding us information, as she races through a gallery of 
distinct and amusing types, not all of them female (the title itself is a quote 
from "Bleak House's" ballet master, Mr. Turveydrop), but presented here with a 
distinctly cartoonish edge that was certainly part of the Dickensian style, but 
which also puts limits on profundity. 
</P>
<P>
This is perfectly all right, since Margolyes does not pretend to offer more 
than a brisk, lighthearted evening in the company of the neurotic master 
novelist. It is serious only in the anguished picture she paints of a 
compulsive and unhappy man, as she draws her connections between Dickens' 
real-life nurse, his mother, his wife (from whom he became estranged), his 
obsessional loves for young female relations and the characters that eventually 
found their way into his books. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even as she delivers this portrait of the troubled writer, she keeps the 
tone and context chipper, in adherence to the show's primary purpose. She has 
tongue-in-cheek fun with his fondness for 17-year-old girls and offers savvy, 
deliberately overblown portrayals of Dickens' older harridans. 
</P>
<P>
The women range from the sordid splendors of "Martin Chuzzlewit's" Mrs. Gamp 
(the midwife and layer-out of corpses who "hatched 'em and dispatched 'em") to 
the more familiar faces of Mrs. Nickleby, "David Copperfield's" Mrs. Micawber, 
and such tender shoots as "Copperfield's" Dora and "The Old Curiosity Shop's" 
Little Nell. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Margolyes also dips into "Oliver Twist," "Dombey and Son," 
"Great Expectations," "Bleak House" and "Little Dorrit," recreating not only 
her Flora Finching but also throwing in Miss Wade for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens, who could coin the most intoxicating character names in the English 
language, also had a remarkable career as a solo reader of his own work. We 
cannot attest to his quality as a performer, but we can vouch for the 
vividness, richness and complexity of another Dickens proselytizer, the late 
Emlyn Williams and his one-man "Charles Dickens." 
</P>
<P>
Margolyes doesn't deliver anything quite that unforgettable. But what she does 
offer is a cozy visit with some deftly etched women by one of literature's 
greatest inventors of characters, second perhaps only to Shakespeare. 
</P>

<P>
Time spent on the freeway isn't necessarily wasted, despite what some critics 
of Southern California say. First, an automobile trip is the ideal opportunity 
to shape up your body, as two Northridge authors made clear in "Commuter 
Calisthenics" a couple of years ago. The book outlined 70 on-the-road 
exercises, from the two-handed ceiling push (not recommended at high speeds or 
in convertibles) to the seat-belt sit-up. 
</P>
<P>
And now, for the motoring chef, comes "Manifold Destiny: The One! The Only! 
Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine." 
</P>
<P>
Among the recipes offered by authors Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller is 
"Melrose Avenue Chicken," a chicken-olive oil concoction that should be wrapped 
in aluminum foil (thoroughly), placed on a suitably hot part of the engine 
surface (they prefer the exhaust manifold) and cooked "for one hour, turning 
when halfway done." 
</P>
<P>
(Thus, if you throw your Melrose Chicken on the engine as you head out for 
Thousand Oaks from downtown L.A. in rush-hour traffic, it would probably be 
best to exit in Encino to flip it. More sophisticated chefs might want to 
consider the purchase of a Mazda equipped with a rotisserie engine.)

The authors point out that since Angelenos "spend a good part of each day in 
their cars," anyway, engine cooking (in lieu of restaurant dining) will enable 
them to save "money that would be better spent on real estate." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the energy-savings angle. This form of cuisine gives new meaning 
to the phrase, "cooking with gas." 
</P>
<P>
It could rank as the most unusual taped replay of the basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, several viewers called CBS to complain that a Laker ball boy had 
flashed a gang sign during a break in the Lakers-Celtics game at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Laker officials confronted the teen-ager, who admitted only that he had given 
the Celtics a one-finger salute. 
</P>
<P>
Gang experts from the Inglewood Police Department were asked to referee the 
matter. They watched a videotape and ruled that the gesture was a gang sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident is very regrettable and quite obviously does not reflect the 
feelings of the Lakers players, fans or organization," said Forum spokesman Bob 
Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
The ball boy, Steiner added, "will not be back." 
</P>
<P>
Thad Taylor, who founded the Shakespeare Society of America in 1964 and created 
West Hollywood's Globe Playhouse in 1972, first tried to get The Bard a star on 
Hollywood's Walk of Fame 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lord, what fools these mortals be. 
</P>
<P>
The quest is hopeless, and not because some critics have charged that everyone 
from Christopher Marlowe to Neil Simon wrote plays credited to Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
The main problem is that Walk of Fame politics conspire against the dead 
playwrights society. Hollywood prefers personalities who are willing and able 
to appear at the star-unveiling ceremonies. Alas, long-gone Will can't supply a 
"photo opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Terry Tamminen did stand in for The Bard as he unveiled a 
plaque for Shakespeare outside the Globe. Makes you wonder how the boy would 
have done if only he'd had an agent.

NEW JEAN LINE USES GANG THEMES IN ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A flood of flashy commercials will be aired during tonight's Grammy Awards on 
CBS. But none are likely to prove more provocative than one for Soviet, a new 
line of denim jeans looking for attention. 
</P>
<P>
The ad for California viewers features a gang member dressed in a red bandanna. 
He is suddenly surrounded by gang members dressed in blue bandannas. One guy in 
blue, speaking in Russian, says, "You don't belong here." The guy in red, also 
speaking Russian, responds, "None of us belong here." The words "Work it out," 
appear on the screen, followed by the Soviet jeans logo. 
</P>
<P>
A similar ad, this one featuring African-American and Italian-American gang 
members who also speak Russian, will air in the New York market. "We're not 
trying to glamorize gangs," said Ed Backholm Jr., director of marketing for the 
Seattle-based U.S. distributor of the jeans, Seattle Pacific Industries. "They 
aren't hugging and kissing each other at the end of the commercial. That wasn't 
our intention. The ad is about conflict and realistic resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is something few advertisers have dealt with before: the Los Angeles 
gang problem. Anti-gang public service spots are one thing. But here an 
advertiser portrays gang incidents, albeit incidents that appear to be solved 
peaceably, all for the sake of selling jeans. 
</P>
<P>
"Advertising always exploits issues of the day in order to be memorable," said 
Carol Moog, a clinical psychologist and advertising consultant in Bala-Cynwyd, 
Pa. "The question is: Is it somehow hip to be a gang member because you're 
portrayed on TV in this way?" 
</P>
<P>
The agency that created the advertisements said that isn't the intention at 
all. "Anything you put on film that involves gangs is controversial," said Jim 
Walker, creative director at the Seattle office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide. 
"But this is not an attempt to glorify gangs. It raises the issue, what if gang 
members met and no one got hurt?" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the commercials are clear attempts to familiarize consumers with 
the Soviet label. The jeans, which are actually made in Hong Kong, have limited 
distribution and have only been sold in the United States since January. On a 
very modest ad budget, Soviet is trying to compete for consumer attention with 
the likes of Guess? and Levis. But unlike the competition, its commercials are 
political in nature. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with the commercials may be that they're spoken in Russian, 
Moog said. "While the ads imply verbal negotiations are the best way to solve 
problems," she said, "they communicate in a language most people watching them 
won't understand." 
</P>
<P>
One gang expert doesn't like the concept of the ads at all. "They're just 
capitalizing off gangs to sell blue jeans," said Alexander Poe, executive 
director of the youth services group, Right Way. "Of course, the Bloods won't 
wear blue jeans at all -- they're blue." 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Marc Chiat filmed several anti-gang public service spots that 
featured gang members advising others not to join gangs. "I don't think these 
ads will help or hinder the gang problem," said Chiat, co-founder of Red Dog 
Films. "Yesterday some gang members died. Today, more will die. And tomorrow 
more will get killed. Maybe people should put their energy into solving the 
gang problem instead of debating if these ads are right or wrong."

BANK'S INROAD INTO SECURITIES SALES IS UPHELD; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE SUPREME COURT REFUSED TO STOP SECURITY PACIFIC FROM PACKAGING ITS 
MORTGAGES FOR SALE TO INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to bar Security Pacific National Bank 
from pooling its mortgages and selling them as securities to investors, a move 
that further chips away at the nation's 57-year-old law separating banks from 
the securities business. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, however, securities industry representatives and bankers disagreed 
sharply over how much the court's action erodes the Depression-era 
Glass-Steagall Act separating the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Securities industry officials called the Supreme Court move a major blow to the 
act, and some other observers predicted that it will provide bankers further 
inroads into the securities business. But banking executives said such 
assessments exaggerate the effect and that the court simply upheld the right of 
banks to sell loans as they choose. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a step in the right direction, but by no means did the wall tumble," 
said Richard M. Gerwitz, a managing director of Security Pacific 's merchant 
banking unit. 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from Security Pacific's move in 1987 to bundle home loans and 
sell them to investors as "pass-through certificates." Investors who buy 
certificates, also called mortgage-backed securities, receive a stake in the 
bank's pool of mortgages. Principal and interest payments made by homeowners 
are then "passed through" to investors who own the certificates. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, who regulates national banks 
such as Security Pacific, gave the bank his blessing, saying laws do not 
restrict the way banks can sell their mortgages. Security Pacific National Bank 
is the main unit of Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's opinion sparked a lawsuit filed against him by the Securities Industry 
Assn., the main trade group for brokerages. The suit maintains that Security 
Pacific's activities amounted to the underwriting of securities, which is 
forbidden by the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. In one court paper, the association 
went so far as to say that allowing Security Pacific to continue its program 
would be to "write Glass-Steagall right out of the statute books." 
</P>
<P>
Enacted during the Great Depression amid fears that securities ventures would 
cause bank failures, Glass-Steagall is a legal barrier preventing banks from 
entering such investment-banking activities as underwriting stocks. Bankers 
have long criticized the law as outdated and have chipped away at the barrier 
the past two years as regulators have allowed such expanded powers as 
underwriting corporate debt . 
</P>
<P>
A federal appeals court last September said Security Pacific could package its 
own loans and underwrite them as securities, calling it "the business of 
banking." That decision reversed a 1988 ruling by a federal judge. The Supreme 
Court, without comment, let stand the appeals court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the Supreme Court action, the securities association warned that 
one result could be an increase in risks for banks and taxpayers, who insure 
deposits up to $100,000. It urged Congress to take up the Glass-Steagall 
controversy to "prevent the random chipping away by federal banking agencies of 
the safety barriers between the two industries."

FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE GOES UNDER REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
SAVINGS: CONGRESS WANTS TO RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE OF DEPOSITORS BUT DOESN'T 
WANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO TAKE UNREASONABLE RISKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal deposit insurance had a mixed record during the 1980s: It prevented 
panic in the streets by nervous savers but also provided the fuel for 
disastrously risky new ventures by savings and loan associations. 
</P>
<P>
Today Congress begins the difficult task of reforming the insurance system to 
handle banking in the 1990s. Once again, the legislators want to bolster the 
shaken confidence of depositors. But they also want U.S. savings institutions 
to take more reasonable risks, seeking out new lines of business as they 
compete with capital-rich Japanese banks. 
</P>
<P>
The House Banking Committee will begin considering a number of proposals as it 
conducts hearings today. For example, some members of Congress would require 
banks and S&amp;Ls to seek private insurance for high-risk ventures instead of 
relying on the federal insurance, which guarantees deposits up to $100,000. 
Some may also argue that the government should lower the $100,000 ceiling for 
guaranteeing deposits. Still others may press for limiting deposit insurance to 
$100,000 per person, not per account. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 10% of Americans had liquid financial assets -- cash, savings and 
checking accounts, certificates of deposit -- over $40,000 in 1980, when 
Congress boosted the deposit guarantee limit from $40,000 to $100,000. 
Brokerage houses eagerly solicited the money of wealthy investors in search of 
the highest safe yield, split the money into increments of $100,000 and sent it 
racing throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
The money poured into S&amp;Ls, and too many managers sent it surging out again 
for use in dubious ventures: raw land, horse-breeding farms, shopping centers 
in already jammed retail markets, condominiums with no chance of an economic 
payoff. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), the House Banking Committee chairman, has 
questioned whether the insured ceiling is too high and whether wealthy savers 
should be allowed to have numerous accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we need to examine the absolute limits of the coverage," said 
Gonzalez, "but (we need) to determine whether the multiple accounts maintained 
by some depositors are unnecessarily increasing the risks to the (deposit 
insurance) funds." 
</P>
<P>
However, it seems unlikely that Congress would agree to roll back the $100,000 
guarantee for fear that the public might view this as a retreat from vital 
protection of savings. 
</P>
<P>
"To seek to lower the $100,000 limit at this time would severely impact on 
encouraging individual savings and may well have a negative effect on the 
health of financial institutions," said Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), a member of 
the banking committee. 
</P>
<P>
But members agree that there will be a serious discussion of ways to remove 
deposit protection from risky activities to prevent a repetition of the 
investment excesses of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said he wants to examine "private insurance possibilities, 
particularly for high-risk activities and for extended coverage beyond that 
provided by the federal insurance funds." A revised insurance mechanism will 
become essential to any discussion of granting new powers to banks, allowing 
their widespread involvement in the securities and insurance fields. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has 
previously proposed that higher-risk activities be placed in subsidiaries with 
their own capital, and rigidly separated from the savings institutions. If the 
insurance or brokerage business is failing, it would get no rescue funds from 
the parent bank or from the federal government, and the collapse won't harm the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
Segregating conventional banking from higher risk ventures would be a better 
answer than cutting back the amount of deposits eligible for insurance, said an 
FDIC official. "In today's electronic computer-driven age, it is not much more 
difficult for brokers to split $1 million into 20 accounts of $50,000 each, 
than it was to create 10 accounts of $100,000," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L consultant Bert Ely suggests that the ultimate solution is a private 
insurance system, with banks and S&amp;Ls creating pools to provide insurance 
coverage for each other. Financial institutions taking bigger risks would pay 
higher premiums for insurance. Under the current system, there is no separate 
recognition for risk. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government insurance fund would be a backup in case the industry 
insurance failed, said Ely.

Modest Rebound: A look at the Gulf states suggests an upswing in the oil 
industry. The rig count in Louisiana rose again last week by four units to 143, 
an increase over the 12 rigs in the same week a year ago. Industry observers 
see this rebound from January's slip from 179 rigs to 139 as an indication of a 
better year ahead. At the same time, another source reports that the 
utilization rate of offshore mobile units in the Gulf rose to 69.8% from 45.8% 
a year ago. One company stepping up its exploration is Freeport-McMoRan 
Partners of New Orleans. The firm will increase its exploration and capital 
expenditures budget by 42% to $188 million, with $56 million slated for 
exploration alone. Times-Picayune, Morning Advocate 
</P>
<P>
New Discount Strategy: It seems that last year's retail rage -- everyday low 
prices -- is this year's has-been strategy. Target discount stores tested the 
concept at 50 of its outlets and found that it failed to stimulate enough 
sales. In its place Target will try a system of "great buys," products at low 
prices that never go on sale, and weekly sales promotions. The company says 
this is a blend of what customers liked about both strategies. Detroit Free 
Press, Newsday

<P>
Approval Nears: Industry observers say two artificial sweeteners discovered in 
the early 1970s, Johnson &amp; Johnson's sucralose and Pfizer's alitame, may 
soon win approval of the Food and Drug Administration. Both sucralose and 
alitame are sweeter than Monsanto's aspartame (known commercially as 
NutraSweet), and both are heat stable, which aspartame is not. At the same 
time, Abbott Labs' cyclamate is under consideration by the FDA for 
reinstatement; the original data linking it to cancer apparently was flawed. 
The artificial sweetener market is also being pursued by Coca-Cola and 
Biospherics, both of which have products in the pipeline. The Atlanta Journal

Hot Competition: Two innovative antiperspirants, created by Helene Curtis and 
Revlon, will hit store shelves at the same time and both will be backed by big 
promotions. Helene Curtis' Degree, formulated to become effective when body 
heat rises, will receive a $50-million kick-off promotion, coupon and ad 
campaign. The company expects sales of the unisex product to reach $50 million 
in two years. At the same time, Revlon is introducing No Sweat, which works on 
the same principle as Degree but is triggered by moisture. This product will 
receive a $10-million ad boost. Crain's Chicago Business

T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $7.6 billion of new three-month 
bills at an average discount rate of 7.80%, up from 7.65% last week. Another 
$7.6 billion of new six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 
7.77%, also up from 7.65% last week. The new discount rates understate the 
actual return to investors -- 8.07% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill 
selling for $9,802.80 and 8.20% for a six-month bill selling for $9,607.20.

Great Northern Agrees to Buyout: Great Northern Nekoosa said it agreed to a 
$5-billion buyout by Georgia-Pacific, dropping its vehement four-month 
opposition to a deal that would create the largest U.S. forest-products 
company. Great Northern agreed to the deal after Georgia-Pacific sweetened its 
offer to $65.75 a share from $63, a spokesman said. In addition to acquiring 
Great Northern's 57-million common shares outstanding for $3.7 billion, 
Georgia-Pacific will assume $1.3 billion in Great Northern debt.

LABOR BOARD ADDS CHARGE TO NORDSTROM COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Nordstrom department store chain, already embroiled in a heated workplace 
dispute, will be hit with an expanded unfair labor practices complaint by the 
National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the expanded complaint, the NLRB will charge that the company has tried to 
sidestep the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents nearly 
2,000 Nordstrom workers in the Seattle area, by illegally encouraging employees 
to negotiate directly with the company to resolve disputes over back pay. 
</P>
<P>
The union and many individual Nordstrom workers have alleged that managers 
coerced employees into not charging the company for many of their work hours. 
</P>
<P>
The new NLRB charge stems from an investigation by the agency that found that 
Nordstrom sent employees two memos urging them to talk to company managers 
about their claims regarding unpaid off-the-clock work. Under federal labor 
law, unionized companies must negotiate wages, hours and working conditions 
with their unions. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the NLRB accused Nordstrom of two other unfair labor practices: 
negotiating directly with workers on a new labor agreement and withholding 
documents requested by union officials concerning the back-pay dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The NLRB is seeking only to force Nordstrom to halt the alleged practices, 
which the company disputes. If a hearing officer rules in the agency's favor, 
there would be no financial damages. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, however, the Washington Department of Labor and 
Industries on Thursday found Nordstrom in violation of the state's minimum-wage 
act and ordered it to pay an undetermined amount in back wages. The union has 
estimated that the back-pay claims could total more than $30 million in that 
state alone. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nordstrom, company co-chairman, countered in a prepared statement that 
the nature of the ruling made it "difficult to assess the extent of any 
financial obligations." But he added that the company believes any financial 
impact would "not be material" and that it is evaluating an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom's stock was off $1.75 on Tuesday, closing at $27.75, but analysts 
attributed the fall mainly to the general decline in the market and to an 
announcement by the company Thursday that it expected lower earnings.

U.S. SMOKING TOLL PUT AT $52 BILLION;

HEALTH: ILLNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY LOSSES AVERAGE ABOUT $1 BILLION PER STATE 
ANNUALLY, THE GOVERNMENT REPORTS. THE CALIFORNIA COST IS $5.8 BILLION.

Health care expenses and productivity losses associated with smoking-related 
disease cost the nation more than $52 billion every year, according to a 
government report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health and Human Services, in a national status report to 
Congress, estimated that illnesses caused by smoking impose an average economic 
burden of $1 billion per state, although some states run much higher tabs than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
California, the most populous state, has the highest estimated smoking cost, 
$5.8 billion, the report said. Alaska was lowest, with $82 million annually. 
Following California, in order, were New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, 
Ohio and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
The annual expenses of smoking-related disease average $221 for every man, 
woman and child in the nation, ranging from a low of $56 a person in Utah to 
$284 in Rhode Island, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, congressional sponsors of a law banning smoking on virtually all 
domestic airline flights vowed Tuesday to fight for no-smoking rules on other 
forms of transportation and to attack U.S. trade policies that encourage 
tobacco exports. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N. J.) and Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said 
that they would next press their campaign to apply to Amtrak train service and 
other transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The airline smoking ban, which begins Sunday, will apply to domestic flights of 
six hours or less. Longer flights, charter flights and overseas flights are 
exempt. 
</P>
<P>
The law expands and extends a temporary smoking ban on short domestic flights 
that was adopted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The HHS report said that expenses related to smoking are borne indirectly by 
all Americans in the form of higher private and public insurance premiums and 
the increased burden on publicly supported health care facilities and 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"Each and every American, including those who don't even smoke, is paying a 
hidden tax . . . for the consequences of smoking," HHS Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan said in testimony before a Senate committee considering anti-smoking 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"My view," Sullivan said, "is straightforward and simple: no smoking." 
</P>
<P>
The report was immediately assailed by the Tobacco Institute, which said that 
"to assume that smokers impose a cost on society is a misapplication of a valid 
economic theory." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the industry group, said that "smokers pay 
their own (insurance) premiums, so they cover their own costs. And, just 
because they file a claim, it doesn't mean it's a smoking claim." 
</P>
<P>
Further, she said, "if people are less productive, that's not a cost to society 
-- they bear the burden through lower pay, less frequent job promotions or 
getting fired." 
</P>
<P>
The report said that smoking causes more premature deaths than cocaine, heroin, 
alcohol, fire, automobile accidents, homicide and suicide combined. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that smoking kills nearly 400,000 Americans each year and is 
responsible for more than one of every six deaths in the United States. In 
addition, he said, smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among 
low-income, less-educated Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I am especially concerned that we make more progress in reaching young people, 
women, minorities and blue-collar workers with accurate and compelling 
information about smoking and its devastating impact on their health," he said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ronald M. Davis, director of the HHS Office on Smoking and Health, said 
that deaths caused by smoking have increased during the last 20 years, despite 
a dramatic decline in the number of smokers. In 1965, 40% of all U.S. adults 
were cigarette smokers, compared to 29% in 1987, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, "it takes a good 20 to 25 years after the smoking rates go down 
before we begin to see a decrease in smoking-related deaths and costs," he said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan recently criticized plans by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to test-market 
in Philadelphia a new cigarette, called Uptown, targeted at black smokers. The 
firm quickly announced that it had canceled the marketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan told members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee that he 
was just as upset by the company's plan to introduce another new cigarette, 
called Dakota, reportedly aimed at young blue-collar women. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outraged," he said when questioned about Dakota. "No one believes the 
tobacco companies when they say they are not targeting young people." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the average number of deaths attributed to smoking was 6,097 per 
state, ranging from 271 in Alaska to 28,533 in California.

FIRE THREATENS DISASTER IN CANADA; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THOUSANDS OF BURNING TIRES COULD PRODUCE TONS OF OIL LADEN WITH 
TOXIC CHEMICALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A fire burning for more than a week in a tire dump the size of 18 football 
fields is threatening to become a major environmental disaster here in southern 
Ontario province, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
If just half of the estimated 14 million tires in the dump were to liquefy in 
the fire's intense heat, one Canadian expert on tire recycling has said, they 
could produce more oil than last year's notorious Exxon Valdez oil spill in 
Alaska. And such oil, containing toxic chemicals, would be even harder to clean 
up than the Exxon Valdez disaster, warned the expert, Brian Latto, a mechanical 
engineering professor at the University of Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the oil) goes down into the soil, you can't clean it, whereas on the sea, 
at least you can clean it with detergents," Latto said. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they believe an arsonist started the fire. Hundreds of area 
residents had to be evacuated last week as the top layers of the tires burned 
and huge clouds of black smoke billowed into the sky. Now, however, the top 
layer has melted into a lava-like ooze covering the burning tires below, 
creating a structure resembling an oven. 
</P>
<P>
Less black smoke is evident now, and some of the residents have ventured home. 
But the fire is still burning, and Latto said there is enough oxygen beneath 
the pile's surface to fuel the blaze for weeks or months. In the United States, 
tire fires have burned for six months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"The tires are a beautiful rabbit warren for air to get in, like wood in a 
grate," he said, adding that temperatures inside the pile could be as high as 
4,532 degrees Fahrenheit -- hotter than the melting point of steel. 
</P>
<P>
Extreme heat turns rubber into oil, and a single tire can generate about two 
gallons of oil as it liquefies. Thus, if half the pile at Hagersville were to 
melt, about 14 million gallons of toxic oil could seep into the farmland and 
ground water nearby. The Exxon Valdez leaked about 11 million gallons of oil 
into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Latto noted that this is a worst-case calculation and that the Hagersville fire 
could ultimately send much less oil into the ground water, depending on wind, 
soil conditions and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the oil from the burning tires contains cancer-causing benzene and 
toluene, along with other chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters in the region have expressed concern that the water they have been 
using to fight the blaze is actually helping to leach the oil and chemicals 
into the ground. Last weekend, they stopped spraying water on the fire and dug 
ditches for the dirty water to run into. 
</P>
<P>
Then they wrestled huge hoses into place at the ends of the ditches and went to 
work trying to skim the oil off the water and pump it into tanker trucks. They 
said they hoped to reuse the dirty water to extinguish the flames, but they 
added that some of the contaminated liquid will inevitably seep into the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said ground water in the Hagersville area flows toward Lake Erie at 
about 500 yards per year. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at Edward Straza's Tyre King Tyre Recycling Ltd., where 
neighbors said Straza made a living receiving unwanted tires from service 
stations, charging garage owners 50 cents to $1 apiece to dump the unwanted 
tires on his land. They said he had a sharp eye for picking still-usable tires 
out and reselling them. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the tires just sat on his land, heaped in piles at least 30 feet 
tall. Straza even had tires in his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Such sites are fairly common in industrialized countries, Latto said. 
</P>
<P>
After a small fire at the dump site several years ago, Ontario officials had 
ordered Straza to fence off the tires, to arrange them in separate heaps so 
that firetrucks could drive among them if necessary and to build a 
100,000-gallon water reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
However, Straza had argued that the cost of reorganizing the tires in separate 
piles and digging a reservoir would put him out of business. He appealed the 
order, the tires stayed put and the authorities had not yet ruled on the appeal 
when the current blaze broke out.

Britain failed Tuesday to persuade the European Community to ease sanctions 
against South Africa and announced that it would unilaterally lift an embargo 
on new investment. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no consensus on a lifting of sanctions," an Irish government 
spokesman said at the end of a one-day meeting of EC foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd announced immediately afterward that 
Britain would unilaterally lift the embargo on new investment. "I cannot see 
any reason for delay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Britain had tried to avoid going it alone by offering to delay lifting 
the embargo if all 12 EC nations pledged to lift it jointly when the South 
African government ends its state of emergency. But he said the others refused 
to agree to this compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish spokesman said the EC would consider the issue again when the South 
African government lifts its state of emergency and frees all political 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
The EC decided to send a three-member delegation from France, Ireland and Italy 
-- the past, present and future presidents of the organization -- to South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and Portugal argued strongly for sanctions to be eased now to encourage 
Pretoria's white-run government to enact further reforms, officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the West's most outspoken opponent of 
sanctions against South Africa, wants to gradually lift the EC's mild 
embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
She argues that unless South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk can show 
some positive international response to his legalizing of the African National 
Congress and the release of Nelson R. Mandela, he could be toppled in a white 
backlash.

The State Department said Tuesday that Cuba has received a new shipment of 
fighter planes from the Soviet Union and that the United States "simply cannot 
tolerate" such developments. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler denied that the 
statement constituted a threat to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
She referred reporters to Secretary of State James A. Baker III's recent 
testimony before a Soviet legislative committee, in which he said that Cuba 
poses no threat to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the Soviet legislators that the United States has difficulty 
understanding why the Kremlin continues to send MIG-29 fighter jets to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler confirmed a delivery of new MIG-29s but gave no figures. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler also quoted Baker as saying that "Cuba is actively supporting the 
insurgency in El Salvador, and it is these kinds of activities close to the 
shores of the United States that we simply cannot tolerate."

CURBS STAND ON UNPUBLISHED WRITINGS

<P>
The Supreme Court let stand Tuesday a controversial ruling that biographers and 
historians may not use unpublished letters, manuscripts, diaries and other 
works without the permission of the writers or their heirs. 
</P>
<P>
Without comment, the high court dismissed an appeal by a company that had 
published "Bare-Faced Messiah" by Russell Miller, a biography critical of the 
late L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the church of Scientology (Holt vs. New Era 
Publications, 89-869). 
</P>
<P>
The original ruling, made last April by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals 
in New York, allowed publication of "Bare-Faced Messiah" to proceed on a 
technicality but declared that unpublished works "normally enjoy complete 
protection" from being quoted by others. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling was denounced by scholars, authors and free speech advocates. The 
publisher, Henry Holt &amp; Co., said at the time that the ruling was "being 
used to muzzle responsible biographers and historians." Moreover, Holt said, 
the ruling forced publishers to engage in "self-censorship" and prevented the 
examination of historical truth. 
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, Hubbard had written letters to the FBI, the White House 
and the Veterans Administration, letters that biographer Miller obtained 
through a Freedom of Information request. He planned to quote from the letters 
in an effort to show that Hubbard was a fraud and a liar. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the church's publishing house filed a copyright infringement 
suit against Holt and Miller, arguing that church officials had the exclusive 
right to use the unpublished letters. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court, on a 2-1 vote, agreed, although it rejected the 
Scientologists' effort to block the book because the suit was filed too late. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the New York-based court first aroused concern in the 
publishing industry by blocking a planned biography of reclusive author J. D. 
Salinger because the book contained excerpts from his private letters. Lawyers 
for Salinger contended that the right to publish those letters was his alone. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Supreme Court refused to review that decision, but some publishing 
lawyers said the ruling appeared to cover only the highly personal letters of a 
still living author. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling involving the Hubbard materials went further, and, in appeals to the 
high court, the Assn. of American Publishers described the rulings in the 
Salinger and Hubbard cases as "a one-two punch landed by the 2nd Circuit on 
historical and scholarly publishing. In the wake of these decisions . . . no 
prudent publisher can afford to risk even very limited quotation from 
unpublished materials -- no matter the degree of their prior dissemination or 
how compelling the purpose -- since to do so invites injunction of the entire 
work."

A Pentagon report released Tuesday said that the Air Force colonel who resigned 
last week as editor of the Pacific Stars and Stripes newspaper violated 
military regulations by manipulating the paper's news content. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Edwin J. Montgomery resigned Friday, citing the report by ombudsman Philip 
Foisie. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department hired Foisie last year to assess the flow of information 
to the military readership of the Toyko-based Pacific Stars and Stripes and its 
European sister publication based near Frankfurt, West Germany. 
</P>

Montgomery had said he was disappointed that Foisie viewed his editing 
practices as "news management" but was pleased he had not been accused of 
censorship. 
</P>
<P>
In his report, Foisie said that the editing process at Pacific Stars and 
Stripes under Montgomery was "seriously flawed" but that there was no 
censorship in the sense of readers being systematically deprived of any 
specific type of news. 
</P>
<P>
"In my professional judgment, Col. Montgomery has too often infringed on the 
common practice of good journalism," Foisie wrote.

PUERTO RICAN GOVERNMENT TO SELL PHONE SYSTEM

Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon said Tuesday his government will sell the Puerto 
Rico Telephone Co. for at least $2 billion to pay for education reforms and 
development on the Caribbean island. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the only company which has enough value" to generate the money needed to 
revamp Puerto Rico's school system and the island's infrastructure, the 
governor said in his "State of the Nation" address. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Colon said the government bought the telephone company during his 
1974 Administration for $165 million when it "was in total abandonment" and had 
only 300,000 telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company, which made $70 million in net income last year, now 
accounts for 1 million telephones in the Spanish-speaking U.S. commonwealth of 
3.3 million people. Hernandez Colon said that in private hands, the telephone 
company can make at least $170 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Technologically, Puerto Rico Telephone is among the most advanced in the 
world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's Puerto Rico Long Distance subsidiary has an estimated 
$200-million long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Colon said he will introduce legislation stipulating none of the 
telephone company's nearly 8,000 jobs would be affected by the sale and that 
there be no rate increases for three years after it is bought. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known if there is a buyer for the telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Colon was in New York City in January and met with multimillionaire 
financier Donald Trump. The governor refused to provide details but said then 
they discussed ways to invest in education reform plans. At the time, Hernandez 
Colon said Trump "was interested." 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he wanted to create two special funds from the telephone 
company sale: a $1-billion fund for education and a $1-billion fund to 
modernize the island's highways, public housing, airports, waste dumps and 
energy operations. 
</P>
<P>
The governor has long said that educational reform -- improving schools, 
classrooms and textbooks and providing salary increases for teachers -- was a 
priority of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"This means there won't be one school in Puerto Rico that is not painted, 
repaired . . . that no school lack desks, blackboards, chalk," he said.

YOUTH CAMP HAS GOOD REPUTATION, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camp O'Neal, where five victims of the Convict Lake tragedy either lived or 
worked, was founded nearly 20 years ago as way to bring extra money into Mono 
County, according to Probation Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't work out that way, and the camp is now in the hands of a private, 
nonprofit corporation that enjoys a good reputation among some probation 
officials for treatment of troubled youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age boys who spend about 18 months in the awesome beauty of Mammoth 
Lakes are youngsters from various parts of the state who have gotten into minor 
trouble with the law. They frequently come from troubled homes, have 
difficulties in school and sometimes have been termed "emotionally disturbed," 
according to probation officials. 
</P>
<P>
When the facility opened as a county camp in the early 1970s, it was named 
after Maury O'Neal, chief officer of the tiny Mono County Probation Department, 
who persuaded local officials that such a facility could provide treatment for 
the area's troubled adolescents and, at the same time, turn a profit by taking 
in delinquents from other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But with the budget crunches that followed passage of Proposition 13, the camp 
began losing money and in 1987 county officials turned the facility over to the 
privateCamp O'Neal Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbi Trott, who supervised the camp as a Probation Department employee, 
continued to run the facility as secretary of the newly formed firm. Lloyd D. 
Sanders, a Mammoth Lakes realtor, served as chairman of the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The camp now has a capacity of 34 youngsters and charges about $3,000 per 
month, according to Dennis Matthewson, therapist at the facility. The fees are 
ordinarily paid by the counties that send youngsters to the camp, but in some 
cases parents pay the bills, according to Matthewson. Main attractions of the 
facility, he said, are "recreational activities . . . and a very healthy life 
style." 
</P>
<P>
The three youngsters who are presumed drowned in nearby Convict Lake were 
hiking when they fell through the ice, Matthewson said. Two camp counselors and 
two volunteer rescuers also are presumed drowned. 
</P>
<P>
The Tulare County Probation Department provides about half of the clients to 
the camp, where boys between 13 and 18 years of age sleep in a dormitory and 
receive special education classes and training in woodworking and outdoor 
sports and skills. Two of the three youths who died Monday were from Tulare 
County and the third was from San Bernardino County, where the Probation 
Department has half a dozen youngsters placed at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Probation officials in both counties said they do not plan to remove clients, 
pending completion of an investigation by the Mono County Sheriff's Department 
and the state Department of Social Services, which licenses the facility as a 
group home. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they've been very good," said Larry Price, chief probation officer 
for Tulare County. "We usually have about 12 to 14 kids there at all times." 
</P>
<P>
As for the drownings, Price said: "We don't know if these kids were 
unsupervised or supervised. . . . Our department will do a complete 
investigation based on information from the (sheriff's office and state 
licensing officials) and we'll make a determination . . . whether we'll 
continue to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Paytas, supervising probation officer for San Bernardino County, said, 
"We've been pleased with what they've been doing up there . . . stabilizing 
kids, basically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Camp O'Neal's fees are about twice the statewide average of $1,400 per month 
charged by county-run camps for delinquents, according to the Chief Probation 
Officers Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
State financial records indicate that Camp O'Neal took in more than $900,000 in 
revenues in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, although records indicate 
that the camp spent more than it took in. In the meantime, the organization is 
facing a lawsuit by local residents who oppose its plans to expand by opening a 
halfway house for clients. 
</P>
<P>
The facility, with its cluster of buildings on about three acres of land, is 
leased by Camp O'Neal Inc. for $250 a year from the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, which has extensive land holdings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW CONVICT LAKE GOT ITS NAME 
</P>
<P>
According to geographical guidebooks, Convict Lake got its name in 1871 after 
29 convicts escaped from prison at Carson City, Nev. Six of the escapees headed 
south and murdered a mail rider. Local posses caught up with the convicts near 
Monte Diablo Creek -- now Convict Lake. Robert Morrison, a Benton, Calif., 
merchant and posse leader, was killed in the fight. The convicts escaped, but 
three of them were captured a few days later. Two of those were lynched en 
route to the jail at Carson City.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS: VANQUISHED FOE ADMIRES GRANT'S BALANCING ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike McNulty's voice shows a trace of envy when he discusses Grant High, which 
unceremoniously ousted El Camino Real from the City Section 3-A Division 
basketball playoffs last week, 72-48. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a couple of things real well," said McNulty, coach of the 
Conquistadores. "They play pretty good man defense, but what they really do 
well is pass the ball. That's something that can hurt a lot of high school 
teams. They'll make 10 passes when they have to." 
</P>
<P>
Grant's scoring balance also has toppled many teams. McNulty almost gets 
wistful talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have that one real good guy," he said. "They have three or four 
guys who can hurt you. I'd rather have it that way, any time." 
</P>
<P>
Grant (21-3), the East Valley League champion, will play in the quarterfinals 
at 7:30 tonight at home against Locke. 
</P>
<P>
Call him restless: With the exception of garbage time, Jermoine Brantley is 
hardly ever taken out of the lineup during a game, a rarity at Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a kid who played the whole game," Granada Hills Coach Bob 
Johnson said. "I almost always rest a kid the final minute or two of the 
quarter, so they get the minute during the timeout too. But with Brantley, I 
realized I didn't need to." 
</P>
<P>
Brantley, for instance, played every minute of Granada Hills' double-overtime 
victory over Kennedy in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's City 4-A playoff loss to Washington, though, Brantley finally 
needed a breather. After playing the entire first half of the first-round game 
-- Granada Hills took a 50-33 lead -- Brantley was removed in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"For about 30 seconds," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, a finesse team, took a second-half pounding at the hands of 
physical Washington, which won in overtime, 87-85. Johnson said that Brantley 
often was double-teamed, held, pushed and knocked down. After a season of 
setting the pace, the 5-foot-11 senior finally ran out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two or three times in a row in the second half where he drove right 
down the floor to the hoop, or dished it off to somebody," Johnson said. "That, 
along with the physical pounding he was taking, finally wore him down, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Add Johnson: The 12th-year coach said that the development of the team left him 
deeply satisfied with the season, first-round playoff loss or not. 
</P>
<P>
"The team progressed so much from where we started that I have to be happy with 
the season," he said. "We had some serious problems early with bickering on the 
team. I actually had a guy come up to me early in the season, wish me luck and 
ask me how I was going to put up with these guys. 
</P>
<P>
"We had guys who griped, moped and groaned all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who led Granada Hills to the 3-A title three seasons ago, credited 
Brantley and senior forward Aaron Lattimore with taking charge. 
</P>
<P>
"The team changed," Johnson said of the Highlanders, the Times No. 2-ranked 
Valley team at the end of the regular season. "It ended up being one of the 
more fun years I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise package: In North Hollywood's 94-68 dismantling of Lincoln, the 
Huskies might have unearthed the extra weapon needed to make a statement in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
His name? Tommy Byrdsong, senior guard. His effort? Twenty points. That from a 
player who averaged less than 10 during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
One need not convince Coach Steve Miller of Byrdsong's importance. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely (we need that)," Miller said. "They left him open all game." 
</P>
<P>
Worrying about Byrdsong, of course, becomes an added nuisance for Husky foes 
when a team is already concerned about forward Harry Marks, who scored 21 
points Friday night, and center Dana Jones, who scored 19 points to go with 10 
blocks, 15 rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Add North Hollywood: Miller called North Hollywood's effort against Lincoln the 
team's best since the Huskies played Granada Hills. North Hollywood pounded 
Granada Hills, 70-49, on Nov. 29, the team's first game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward that November win, Miller said: "We have to get better. We're going 
to get better." 
</P>
<P>
It took some time, but now, Miller surely would agree, is as good as any. North 
Hollywood (21-3) will play at Hamilton at 7:30 tonight in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
Voodoo basketball: Don't ask Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern out to lunch today, 
unless you're willing to buy him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
After all, it is game day. 
</P>
<P>
Halpern, who subscribes to the old-fashioned, 
I-won't-shower-until-we-win-another-game superstition, will carry on his 
lunchtime tradition in anticipation of tonight's 3-A quarterfinal against San 
Fernando. As will his wife, a firm believer in the power of the basketball 
occult. 
</P>
<P>
As for dinner? 
</P>
<P>
"Normally we don't eat that," Halpern said. "We're too nervous by that time." 
</P>
<P>
Anticipation: The name Lisa Leslie would strike fear into most high school 
girls' basketball coaches. After all, the 6-foot-5 Morningside senior recently 
scored 101 points in one half. 
</P>
<P>
But Channel Islands Coach Ryle Lynch-Cole has been hoping for the opportunity 
to play Morningside, the defending Southern Section Division 5-AA champion. 
Lynch-Cole wants to see how 6-foot junior center Sal Tauau of the Raiders 
matches up against Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been one of our goals all season to play Morningside," Lynch-Cole said. 
"We wanted Sal to get a shot at playing against her before (Leslie) graduates." 
</P>
<P>
A 44-42 win over Alhambra on Saturday night fulfilled Lynch-Cole's wishes. 
Channel Islands will play top-seeded Morningside at 7:30 tonight in a 5-AA 
quarterfinal game at Channel Islands.

STATWATCH: BIG NUMBERS TELL STORY AS BOOK CLOSES ON HIGA, WALTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gabe Higa of Quartz Hill High and Chris Walters of Antelope Valley, two of the 
best basketball players to come out of the high desert, ended their high school 
careers last week when their teams were eliminated from the Southern Section 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Higa, a four-year varsity player, scored 603 points and had 263 rebounds in 26 
games this season, averaging 23.2 points and 10.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
He scored a school-record 43 points against La Puente in December and finished 
his career by scoring in double figures in 49 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
All told, Higa, a 6-foot-6 forward who will attend UC Irvine, scored a 
school-record 1,486 points in 90 games (16.5 average). 
</P>
<P>
Walters, a three-year starter, scored 557 points in 26 games (21.4 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
He made 226 of 452 shots (50%) from the field and 95 of 162 (59%) free throws. 
Walters also had 59 assists and 59 steals. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, a 6-2 forward who is bound for Texas El Paso, scored 1,207 points in 
76 games (15.9 average) in his career. 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding: Although Harvard entered play Tuesday with a record of 22-2, the 
team has struggled on the boards. The Saracens have been outrebounded in five 
games but won each time. 
</P>
<P>
In a convincing 109-78 victory over Blair on Saturday, Harvard held a slight 
rebounding edge, 30-29. 
</P>
<P>
"I know coaches and commentators say that's a vital statistic," Coach Greg 
Hilliard said. "Thank goodness for us, it hasn't worked out that way."

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: OSTERLOH GAVE HARVARD EARLY CLOUT FOR A ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A word to the wise: Don't underestimate Rick Osterloh. 
</P>
<P>
Ask those on the Blair High basketball team who were baptized by fire Friday. 
Rapid fire. 
</P>
<P>
Osterloh, a Harvard senior, scored 30 points and made 10 of 14 shots from the 
field to lead the host Saracens in a 109-78 romp over Blair in a Southern 
Section 3-A Division playoff game. What's more, Osterloh worked quickly -- 
Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard pulled his sharpshooting guard with three minutes 
to play in the third quarter. Hilliard also pulled Matt Clark, who finished 
with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
It took but a tick of the clock to trip the offensive avalanche. Anticipating a 
touch pass from Clark on the opening tip, Osterloh bolted to the hoop and 
scored an uncontested layup. Harvard's defense clung to Blair like a 
sweat-soaked jersey, using a smothering press to steal the ball on each of the 
Vikings' first four possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really surprised," Hilliard said of Blair. "You could tell by the 
look in the guards' eyes in how effective the trapping was. You could actually 
detect a little bit of fear." 
</P>
<P>
Fear might have been a factor but frustration was more readily apparent. The 
Saracens' net kept snapping, as did Blair's morale. Harvard, which entered the 
playoffs as the San Fernando Valley League champion and the top-seeded team in 
the 3-A, held a 33-17 lead at the end of the first period and a 61-37 advantage 
at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
"After we stole the ball a few times, you could hear them bickering at each 
other," Osterloh said. "That's great. Our whole point is to try and make the 
opponents timid, and we really did that in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought before the game that I was going to do everything I could to keep us 
from losing. By the end of the first quarter, everyone was so high and 
confident that there was no way we could lose." 
</P>
<P>
Osterloh and Clark also were called for charging in the first quarter. The 
violent collisions sent a message. 
</P>
<P>
"They let them know that they could stand there and get knocked down each 
time," Hilliard said. "I don't mind them doing that to establish that they 
intend to be aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
And, as confidence-builders go, four dunks didn't hurt. Osterloh, who had not 
slammed since the preseason, had a career-high two. The jams whipped the crowd 
into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Osterloh, meanwhile, was cool and focused. His coach noticed as much from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out very purposeful and prepared," Hilliard said. "He gets very quiet 
and very intense. That's something I really look for. When he sits down before 
the pregame introductions and he's just staring straight ahead, I know he's 
ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the fires of intensity was the fact that Harvard had not played a 
postseason game in three years, making this the inaugural playoff appearance 
for each team member. Four of the Saracens' five starters -- Osterloh, Clark, 
Mike Wolf, and Lloyd Rogers -- have played together since seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
Said Osterloh: "It was like a dream of all of ours."

MASTER'S SHACKLES DELAVEAGA, CLU, 84-62 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven days after Cal Lutheran guard Jeff deLaveaga burned his specially 
designed defense for a season-high 44 points, Master's College basketball Coach 
Mel Hankinson went back to the basics Tuesday night at Bross Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
After watching deLaveaga bombard his version of the box-and-one defense at Cal 
Lutheran, Hankinson came out with a basic switching man-to-man that made 
deLaveaga look like an ordinary player in Master's 84-62 victory in a NAIA 
District 3 game. 
</P>
<P>
"We just pressured him every time he touched the ball," Hankinson said. "We had 
four different guards rotating on him defensively and I think it bothered him." 
</P>
<P>
Although deLaveaga scored a game-high 20 points, 16 of those came in the second 
half when the outcome was already decided. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Master's record to 19-14 overall and 11-6 in District 3 
play, and all but officially guaranteed the Mustangs of their first berth ever 
in the District 3 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The seedings will be announced on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by foul trouble, a cold shooting hand and the Mustangs' hounding 
defense, deLaveaga made only two of six shots in the first half as the Kingsmen 
trailed, 40-24. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't pretty offensively," Hankinson admitted. "But I was very pleased 
with our defense. I feel we're peaking perfectly for the playoffs. We've got a 
team that goes 10 deep now." 
</P>
<P>
Twelve players scored for Master's, led by center-forward Stuart Epperson, who 
came off the bench to score 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Webster had 14 points -- four of which came on two right-handed jams -- 
and teammates Jeff Newton and Ken Sugarman added 11 each. 
</P>
<P>
With deLaveaga (seven for 13) struggling, Brendon Dillon, a 6-foot-4 freshman 
forward from Melbourne, Australia, tried to pick up Cal Lutheran's scoring 
slack, but even his season-high 18 points were not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran trailed, 40-24, at halftime, but things could have been much worse 
for the Kingsmen. They shot 39% (nine of 23) from the field, committed 12 
turnovers and got only four points from scoring ace deLaveaga (two of six), who 
entered the game averaging 27.9 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 38-17, with 3:23 left in the half, the Mustangs got careless with the 
basketball (committing turnovers on each of their last three possessions) and 
Cal Lutheran took advantage of the mistakes to key a 7-2 run to end the first 
20-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon led the Kingsmen charge, with a three-point basket and a 15-foot jump 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga picked up his third foul with 5:11 left in the half, and was 
ineffective when he was in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Master's was led by Sugarman and Epperson, who each scored nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Sugarman was three of three from the field and two of two from the line, while 
Epperson made three of four field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 7-4, early in the game, Master's went on a 23-4 run.

DIGEST: CHELETTE WINS COACHING AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foothill Conference champion Antelope Valley College placed four players, more 
than any other school, on the 11-member, all-conference men's basketball team, 
and the Marauders' Newton Chelette was selected as coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Madison, a 6-foot-2 freshman guard; Paul Ernst, a 6-2 sophomore guard; 
Walter Brooks, a 6-3 sophomore guard; and Steve Walker, a 6-7 center, 
represented Antelope Valley on the all-conference team. 
</P>
<P>
Madison averaged 16.2 points a game to lead the Marauders in scoring and made a 
school-record 107 three-point shots. Ernst, a transfer from Santa Barbara City 
College, averaged 15.5 and Brooks averaged 12.2. Walker grabbed a team-high 7.9 
rebounds a game and scored 12.2. 
</P>
<P>
Chelette, in his first season at Antelope Valley, guided the team to a 27-6 
overall record, 13-1 in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
The West Valley Eagles Track Club won the midget boys' (ages 11 and 12) mile 
relay at the Times/Eagle Indoor Games at The Forum last Friday, adding to the 4 
x 160-yard race it won at the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Armone Lochard, Bryant Hayes, Jalal Milby and Larry Phillips ran 4 
minutes 18.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Peter De La Cerda, a 1989 graduate of Granada Hills High, placed first in the 
Desert Princess Biathlon short course triathlon earlier this month in Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
De La Cerda completed the event -- which included a 1 3/4-mile run, 10-mile 
bike ride and a second 1 3/4-mile run -- in 44 minutes 35 seconds.

SOPHOMORES LEAD FAITH BAPTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Led by sophomores Peter Rasmussen and Alex Estrada, Faith Baptist High rolled 
to a 74-64 win over second-seeded Montclair Prep in a Southern Section 1-A 
Division quarterfinal playoff game Tuesday night at Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a guard, finished with a game-high 28 points and 11 rebounds. 
Rasmussen, a forward, had 21 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist (17-10) played most of the game in a 2-3 zone defense, which 
Montclair Prep (19-5) failed to solve. The Mounties made just 25 of 79 (31.6%) 
field-goal attempts and five of 23 (21.7%) attempts from beyond the three-point 
arc. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Baptist also killed Montclair Prep at the free-throw line, outscoring the 
Mounties, 29-8. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 76, Rancho Alamitos 71 -- Bobby DaCorsi scored 21 points to lead 
Notre Dame as the Knights upset host Rancho Alamitos in the quarterfinal round 
of the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame jumped to a 17-point lead in the first quarter, but Rancho Alamitos 
cut the deficit 11 by the end of the half. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos embarked on a 12-point run in the fourth quarter and cut the 
lead to four points, but the Knights capitalized on two free throws to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena 69, Canyon 65 -- Pasadena's full-court press finally got the best of 
Canyon in the fourth quarter as the Bulldogs scored a come-from-behind victory 
in a 5-A game at Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon led, 40-22, at halftime and, 54-45, after three quarters. But Pasadena 
ran off a 17-4 spurt to take a 62-57 lead with 3 minutes 24 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara 78, Chaminade 42 -- Shon Tarver scored a game-high 35 points to 
lead top-seeded Santa Clara (22-0) in a 2-AA game at Calabasas High. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Mirkovich had 17 points and Mark Wiltshire had 10 for Chaminade (14-11), 
which had 10 rebounds in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Bethel Christian 73, Highland Hall 71 (OT) -- Leo Lett hit a 19-foot jump shot 
at the buzzer to upset the Small Schools' No. 3 seeded team and break Highland 
Hall's 19-game win streak in a game at Bethel Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Highland Hall forced overtime when Craig Ernst scored two of his 21 points with 
four seconds remaining.

<P>
ALL-STARS: TO COUNTER THE WEST'S SCORING PROWESS COACH KENNY COOPER HAS ADDED 
THE BRUTE FORCE OF CLEVELAND'S BERNIE JAMES AND MIKE SWEENEY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be surprised if you go to the 11th MISL All-Star game tonight at the 
Sports Arena and a hockey game breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
No, there won't be any high sticking, but Eastern Division Coach Kenny Cooper, 
of the Baltimore Blast, seems to have used half of his four roster choices on 
players who have done more scuffling in their careers than scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, that's no crime in this league, but remember that the All-Star game 
is traditionally a showcase for offensive prowess, not brute power. 
</P>
<P>
The two controversial picks are defender Bernie James and midfielder Mike 
Sweeney of the Cleveland Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Both are first time All-Stars despite long careers in the league (James has 
been playing since 1982, Sweeney since 1984). 
</P>
<P>
There's a reason for their prolonged absence. 
</P>
<P>
As Sweeney explained it, "We've always been involved in a lot of scuffles and 
had a lot of penalty minutes. And that kind of player doesn't get selected." 
</P>
<P>
Now their time has come. Apparently, Cooper is relying on some elbow grease 
from the twosome to keep the West's forwards off the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It's not really the plan of a desperate man, but Cooper is 0-2 against the 
Sockers' Ron Newman in All-Star games and 0-3 against him in championship 
series. And, well, something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
So it might as well be strategy. Forget the offense, Cooper has got to keep the 
West from scoring. The best way to do that is to keep its players from 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong," Cooper said. "I think we have some firepower. We have 
some guys who can put the ball in the back of the net, but before we do that we 
have to keep the ball from getting in the back of our net." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason James and Sweeney are making their All-Star debuts. Some argue 
that it is long overdue for James. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland defender is the MISL's all-time blocked-shots leader with 848. He 
has yet to gain the reputation of, say, a Kim Roentved, a nine-time All-Star, 
because of his physical style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have been here a long time ago," Cooper said. "He's the top defender 
in the league. He deserves to be here and he gets the job done and the same 
goes for Mike Sweeney." 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney, however, is not a defender. He's a midfielder, although he has gained 
a reputation as a defensive midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Had Cooper wanted to match the West's scoring ability, there were other 
midfielders available. 
</P>
<P>
Most notable among the group: David Byrne. Byrne, now with Wichita, has scored 
14 goals and assisted on 16 others for 30 points in 26 games this season. 
Sweeney, on the other hand, has accumulated 23 points in 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper doesn't admit to making his selections on the basis of players' 
reputations as scrappers. But he doesn't deny it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the indoor game is an intense game," Cooper said. "It is a contact 
sport and we lose sight of that. As a coach, you look for guys who aren't 
afraid to leave a piece of themselves on the carpet. You look for an honest 
effort and Bernie James and Mike Sweeney are two of the most honest players 
I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
What Cooper is most concerned with is a trio of Western players who are not 
only top goal scorers, but also three of the most creative passers in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas' Tatu heads the list. In 33 games, Tatu has scored 41 goals and assisted 
on 33 others. Tacoma's Preki has 18 goals and 26 assists in 28 games. San 
Diego's Branko Segota not only has a first and last name, but also probably the 
league's most powerful legs. Segota's shots are considered among the league's 
hardest, although this year, because of injuries, he has played in only 27 
games, some at three-quarter-speed. In that time, he has scored 16 goals and 
assisted on 24 others. 
</P>
<P>
Another offensive threat from the West is Kia, Preki's teammate in Tacoma, who 
has scored 24 goals and assisted on nine others in 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper knows that if his East team is to win, it's going to have to out-work 
the West. In fact, it has been brought to his attention so often this week, 
he's getting a little irritated. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's calling this a blue-collar team, a hard-working team," he said. 
"But when we win the game (tonight) they won't say that any more." 
</P>
<P>
The label may not even fit going into the game. In the midst of all the Western 
goal-scorers monopolizing the attention, few have bothered to look at the 
league's scoring leaders and notice that nine of the top 12 are on Cooper's 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
They are: Kansas City's Jan Goossens (No. 2 with 41 goals and 33 assists), 
Wichita's Chico Borja (3-21, 30), Cleveland's Michael King (4-32, 18), and 
Hector Marinaro (5-24, 20), Wichita's Dale Irvine (7-31, 12), Kansas City's 
Dale Mitchell (8-29, 12) and Baltimore's Domenic Mobilio (10-27, 11), Tim 
Wittman (10-27, 11) and Carl Valentine (12 -- 15, 21). 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has noticed this. And he's happy with what he sees as a perfect balance. 
While his forwards will be letting shots fly, his defenders will be letting 
their elbows and feet fly. "At the end of the day," he said, "it's a team 
game." 
</P>
<P>
But he's not waiting for the end of the day to prove his philosophy. He's 
waiting for it in hopes his record against Newman will no longer begin with 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later," Cooper says, "the law of averages is going to turn."

The Yugoslav government sent more troops and tanks into Kosovo province in an 
effort to control violent clashes between authorities and ethnic Albanians 
demanding greater autonomy. One Albanian was killed and 10 others were wounded 
in clashes with riot police in the town of Titova Mitrovica. Albanian students 
in Pristina announced that they will continue to boycott university classes to 
demand the resignation of the province's pro-Serbian leaders.

Scientists at a national conference on asbestos said people should be somewhat 
skeptical of new claims that asbestos, used for years in buildings as a fire 
retardant and insulation, is not as dangerous as has been claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Research in the 1960s found that inhaling the fibrous mineral increases the 
risk of developing lung cancer. Articles published in the past year in some 
medical journals and science magazines played down the risks associated with 
asbestos. But panelists at the National Asbestos Conference in San Antonio said 
the articles should be viewed with caution, that evidence from recent studies 
indicates asbestos exposure does pose health risks and that more studies are 
needed.

A 92-year-old woman won her legal fight to save her home and life savings 
Tuesday with a court settlement that effectively overturned a 1987 jury verdict 
that held her liable for an accident caused by her great-nephew after she 
loaned him money to buy a car. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1987 verdict, reached on the first day of a negligence trial, Luella 
Wilson stood to lose her home in North Bennington and her savings of about 
$950,000. 
</P>
<P>
But shortly after noon Tuesday, Wilson received a telephone call from her 
lawyer. "You've won, Luella. You can keep your land, and we have won the case," 
he was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
None of the parties to the case would disclose details of the settlement. 
Sitting at her kitchen table, drinking a shot of whiskey, Wilson said she was 
happy to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel very damned good. I can't walk, but I did win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 Wilson loaned Willard Stuart the money to buy a car, despite his poor 
driving record and lack of a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that, Stuart drove the car off a bridge after drinking beer and 
whiskey and smoking marijuana with a group of young men. One of his companions, 
Mark Vince, was in the back seat during the accident and was seriously injured. 
He later had one leg amputated. 
</P>
<P>
Vince sued Wilson. A jury found her liable in 1987 and ordered her to pay Vince 
$950,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although refusing to reverse the 1987 decision on appeal, the Vermont Supreme 
Court ruled that a jury should decide if Ace Auto of Bennington and its 
president and salesman in the deal, Gary Gardner, should share the liability 
for selling the car to Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
In opening arguments at the trial Tuesday morning, Wilson's lawyer, Frederick 
Harlow, told jurors that Vince, not Wilson, must bear the blame for the fact he 
is mostly paralyzed and has lost a leg.

Last weekend's storm did not end the drought, water officials warned state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"We apparently face the fourth dry year in a row," said Water Resources 
Director David Kennedy. "That storm was helpful, but we need eight or 10 of 
them in a year. On the whole, we are well below average." Kennedy said 
cumulative rainfall statewide is about 70% of normal, and the Sierra snowpack 
is about 60% of normal. However, ground dried over the last three years is 
absorbing much of the water that might normally flow into reservoirs, he said.

A 14-year-old girl who got lost skiing survived a night of subzero temperatures 
by using a technique she saw on television. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Lamerdin of Glenbrook, Nev., told authorities she dug a cave in the 
snow, then climbed in and covered herself with pine boughs. She said she 
learned the trick from "High Mountain Ranger," a TV show that was filmed at 
Lake Tahoe. Lamerdin was skiing at Heavenly Valley when she got lost during a 
snowstorm. She said she could not find the trail, and tried to follow a stream 
out of the mountains. When darkness came, she fashioned the snow cave. In the 
morning, she again started to follow the stream and was found by a search team.

NEWPORT BEACH OPENS ANOTHER MILE OF BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Authorities opened another mile of Orange County beach Tuesday, pronouncing it 
sufficiently purged of the crude oil that spilled from a punctured tanker two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the affected shoreline, however, remained closed as crews continued to 
clean seaside jetties and unearth hidden pockets of oil-stained sand. 
</P>
<P>
About three miles of beach are open now in Newport Beach. A stretch of nearly 
four miles of shoreline on the north half of the city remained closed. All of 
the oceanfront in Huntington Beach is closed while cleanup efforts continue 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're playing hide and seek with sections of oily sand," said Jim Marino, 
a spokesman for British Petroleum, the firm that owns the oil spilled Feb. 7 
from the tanker American Trader. "Our pledge is the same as it's always been. 
We'll be here as long as the oil is." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the investigation into the accident continued, focusing on how the 
ship impaled itself on its own anchor while trying to moor at an offshore 
pipeline berth about 1 1/3 miles off Huntington Beach. Some authorities have 
speculated that the ocean in the area may be shallower than indicated on 
navigation charts, causing the ship to hit the anchor as it rested on the sea 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday 
completed their first full day of a survey to measure the ocean depth at the 
site of the spill. 
</P>
<P>
The navigational charts, which show a minimum ocean depth of 51 feet in the 
vicinity, have not been updated since 1975. Lt. Cmdr. Samuel P. DeBow Jr. of 
the NOAA said a number of factors, including unreported boat wrecks and 
shifting sand, could have created underwater obstructions since that time. 
</P>
<P>
The NOAA survey is to be completed Friday, but then the data will have to be 
adjusted for tidal patterns before being submitted to Coast Guard officials 
investigating the spill. 
</P>
<P>
As areas tainted by the oil spill continued to diminish Tuesday, Newport Beach 
city officials decided to open the beach south of the Newport Harbor jetty 
through the city limits in Corona Del Mar, Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials on Monday had opened a stretch of sand between the west harbor jetty 
and 15th Street, the first to open since the spill closed 14 miles of shoreline 
between Seal Beach and Laguna Beach.

The cleanup of miles of Orange County shoreline fouled with oil spilled from 
the tanker American Trader two weeks ago has reached the "hide and seek" stage 
with patches on oily beaches, said British Petroleum spokesman Jim Marino. 
</P>
<P>
The firm, which owned the spilled crude, has pledged to stay on the cleanup as 
long as necessary. So far, about three miles of Newport Beach's shoreline has 
been cleaned sufficiently to be reopened, leaving another four miles closed. In 
addition, cleanup continues on all of Huntington Beach's closed shoreline.

L.A., BURBANK JOIN SUIT OVER AERIAL SPRAYING;

MEDFLY: COUNCIL INSTRUCTS CITY ATTORNEY TO TRY TO STOP THE MALATHION PROGRAM. 
SIMILAR LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY THE COURTS.

<P>
The Los Angeles City Council joined the battle against malathion spraying 
Tuesday, instructing the city attorney to file a lawsuit intended to stop the 
state's aerial eradication campaign against the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said that, despite assurances from state officials of 
malathion's safety, they believe that far too many questions remain about the 
pesticide's health effects. 
</P>
<P>
"When the health of the public is at stake, government has the responsibility 
to prove it's safe, not for the public to prove that it is unsafe," said 
Councilman Joel Wachs. "The state has clearly failed to meet that burden of 
proof." 
</P>
<P>
The council vote was unanimous. Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said the city 
expects to file its suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to join the suit. The 
vote came after Acting City Atty. Juli Scott told the council that Glendale 
officials had passed a similiar resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to see we're joining hands with the city of Los Angeles," said 
Burbank Councilman Michael Hastings. "It's the only direction we can go." 
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, the Pasadena Board of Directors took the novel 
approach of voting to ban flights of low-flying helicopters over the city in an 
effort to stop spraying. But state officials said the measure would have no 
effect on the state's emergency Medfly program. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Huntington Beach, Garden Grove, Westminster and Pomona already 
have filed suits aimed at stopping the applications of a sticky bait laced with 
malathion, which is now being sprayed over more than 380 square miles of 
Southern California. Efforts by these cities to obtain temporary injunctions 
against the spraying have been denied by Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Orange County filed suit last week in federal court, 
claiming that the spraying was dangerous to the homeless. The society lost its 
initial bid in court, but it is scheduled to argue its case again on Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Getz, the deputy state attorney general who has handled the previous 
suits against the state, said he believes that Los Angeles' attempt to block 
the spraying will fare no better than the others. 
</P>
<P>
"I never take these things lightly," he said, "but I am confident the project 
is legally defensible. Two courts have already said it is." 
</P>
<P>
Getz said he believes that the state has more than proved that aerial spraying 
is safe for the public and is the only practical method to protect California's 
multibillion-dollar fruit industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Wachs, whose Arts, Health and Humanities Committee has sponsored public 
hearings on the issue, said state officials have failed to prove their case. 
</P>
<P>
The medical studies presented by the state have been "outdated, incomplete and 
in several key issues, refuted," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're dealing with the health of the people, you've got to be sure," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he was particularly disturbed by the state's failure to pursue 
alternative means of controlling the Medfly, such as the use of sterile flies 
to breed the pest out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the infestation, the state in fact did attempt to contain it with the 
release of sterile flies, but as the outbreak spread the supply dwindled. Two 
new breeding facilities in Hawaii are expected to be providing a large supply 
of sterile flies by late spring. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo attacked what he called the "arrogance" of state 
officials who have stuck with the spraying campaign despite public complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a blatant example of the urban population being held hostage to the 
agricultural interests of the state," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
Pritsker said the Los Angeles suit will focus on the state's failure to fulfill 
certain legal requirements needed to begin an emergency eradication program. 
</P>
<P>
He said that under state law, the state must prove that all methods of 
eradication other than pesticide have been used to the maximum, that the 
agriculture industry faces significant economic damage and that the public has 
been properly notified of each spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Getz said the state has violated no laws in its eradication program and has 
done everything possible to protect both the public and the agriculture 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Pritsker said the Los Angeles suit is broader than actions filed by other 
cities and, unlike the other suits, will not seek an immediate halt to 
spraying. Instead, the city's strategy will be to allow the court to make a 
more complete examination of the evidence before ruling. He said he expects 
that the case will be heard by the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
In a related action, the Long Beach City Council also voted Tuesday to sue the 
state if there is any expansion of the current spray zone in north and 
northeastern Long Beach.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old Long Beach boy was shot and killed by his best friend Tuesday as 
the two played with a shotgun authorities say was owned by the gang to which 
they both belonged. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was shot in the stomach about 11 a.m. in the 1100 block of Loma Vista 
Drive as he and his 16-year-old friend joked and took turns pointing the gun at 
each other and two other teen-agers watched, Detective William Collette said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the youths were withheld. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a simple case of two kids playing with a gun and not knowing it was 
loaded," Collette said. The gun was owned by the gang and kept under a nearby 
apartment house, he said. The boy and his friend had brought the gun from its 
hiding place to show the others. 
</P>
<P>
The boy who allegedly fired the shot was booked on suspicion of murder and 
taken to Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Downey, Collette said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 85, REJECTED IN MIX-UP, HOSPITAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A "breakdown in communication" triggered an incident in which an 85-year-old 
woman suffering from a brain injury was turned away from the emergency room at 
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica last year, the facility's medical director 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert E. Fredricks said that the hospital's CAT scanner, which helps 
physicians diagnose brain injuries, was not operating Oct. 19, when the woman 
was rushed by ambulance to St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital notified dispatchers with the area's emergency network of the 
problem but the ambulance drivers were not told until they arrived at the 
hospital, Fredricks said. A nurse diverted the ambulance to a nearby hospital, 
where the woman was treated for brain, heart and respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
The incident led to an investigation that found emergency room and quality 
control deficiencies at the facility, and prompted the U.S. Health Care 
Financing Administration to threaten to cut off $37 million in Medicare funding 
for the hospital. Fredricks said those problems will be corrected by a March 6 
deadline.

Alan Speights Luster, 26, sentenced in Los Angeles by U.S. District Judge James 
Ideman, sparked a "public loss of confidence" in the bank's automatic teller 
services during his 1988 Veterans Day weekend crime spree, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Luster and at least two other suspects had obtained a special card that bank 
administrators use to set up accounts for customers and managed to change 
access codes on 273 accounts, U.S. Atty. Gary Lincenberg said. By using 
counterfeit customer bank cards made of cardboard, Luster and his accomplices 
then withdrew up to $12,000 from each account, Lincenberg said.

TOP 1989 POLLUTION PENALTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District has responsibility to control 
air pollution in the area. It has the power to seek court-imposed fines against 
polluters of from $25 to $25,000 a day based on such factors as the extent that 
emissions exceed legal limits, potential danger to the public, whether the 
violation was intentional, accidental or due to negligence, and the company's 
history of violations. These are the 20 highest penalties paid in 1989:

REBATES OFFERED TO SAVE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: L.A. UNVEILS A PROGRAM TO HELP RESIDENTS PAY THE COST OF 
SWITCHING TO LOW-FLUSH TOILETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a continuing statewide drought and diminishing out-of-state water 
supplies, Los Angeles officials announced a pilot program Tuesday in which the 
city's Department of Water and Power will offer $100 rebates to residents who 
replace older toilets with ultra-low-flush models. 
</P>
<P>
With two of the models on hand as props during a morning news conference, Mayor 
Tom Bradley kicked off the novel program that encourages Los Angeles residents 
to replace older, water-guzzling toilets with ones that use only 1.6 gallons of 
water per flush -- a reduction that could save Los Angeles as much as 80 
million gallons of water by the time the one-year program ends. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for us to develop every means of water conservation that we 
can," said Bradley, who was joined by City Council members and representatives 
of local water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The placement of low-flush models in homes throughout Los Angeles, Bradley 
added, "could save a significant amount of water that is otherwise now wasted 
by being flushed through the system." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP and Metropolitan Water District have budgeted $750,000 for the pilot 
program, which seeks to replace 7,500 older toilets -- which may use up to 
seven gallons of water with each push of the lever -- with the ultra-low-flush 
models. Residents of single and multifamily dwellings who participate in the 
program would be given $100 rebate checks upon verification of installation by 
DWP officials. 
</P>
<P>
With some of the toilets selling for as little as $50, the rebate check could 
"defer all or a big portion of the cost of replacing the toilet," said Rick 
Caruso, president of the Board of Water and Power, adding that residents could 
choose to do the installation themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the first such rebate offer made by the DWP in the area of water 
conservation, according to officials, and it comes at a time when California's 
water resources are rapidly diminishing in the midst of a four-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best means of water conservation available because it's the 
machine that does it for you. . . . You don't have to change your life style," 
said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the city because we don't have to take the water out of Mono 
Lake," Galanter continued, referring to the body of water in the Eastern 
Sierra. And, she added, "We don't have to purchase it from other resources." 
</P>
<P>
Besides minimizing water waste, DWP officials said, such conservation efforts 
can decrease water costs for single-family customers by approximately $19.50 
per toilet per year, and reduce pressure on Los Angeles' overtaxed sewage 
system -- a system that became so burdened with storm overflow this past 
weekend that a city treatment plant had to divert some of its waste into the 
ocean to prevent it from flowing into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials have taken steps in the past to conserve water that 
is often flushed away and wasted. A state standard was set in 1983 that 
required all toilets sold in the state to use only 3.5 gallons of water per 
flush. The Los Angeles City Council took the action a step further, approving 
an ordinance in 1988 that required all toilets installed in newly constructed 
homes or residential additions to use 1.5 gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebate program shows significant water savings for customers, the 
project could extend indefinitely, Caruso said.

FUNNYMAN STEVE ALLEN FINDS AMERICA'S 'DUMBTH' ANYTHING BUT FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's the world coming to? A lot of Americans don't know where Mexico is. They 
think Delaware is a city. Asked to name a tribe that has invaded England, they 
answer, "The Aztecs." They ask actor Robert Young for medical advice, just 
because he played Dr. Marcus Welby on television, and they write letters to 
Kentucky Derby winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Not the jockey, not the trainer, but the horse," said an incredulous Steve 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
With a look of inspired mystification, the veteran comedian-author-songwriter 
paused in his description, bolstered by studies and personal experiences, of 
creeping dumbness in America to picture somebody actually writing a letter to a 
horse. "Something like, 'Dear Seabiscuit. . . . Thanks for winning the Kentucky 
Derby. I won 28 bucks on you. Keep up the good work. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Allen's audience at Caltech chortled appreciatively. 
</P>
<P>
"The American people are dumber now than they have been in a very long time," 
said Allen, who has written a book called "Dumbth" on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, 68, has come a long way since he commanded a squad of wacky characters 
in the NBC Studios in New York, on the original "The Tonight Show." In those 
days, more than 30 years ago, Allen might have traded gibes with some New 
Jersey cheerleaders in the audience, hooked himself up to a vibrating 
girth-reducing machine or chatted amiably with entertainers Steve Lawrence and 
Eydie Gorme, before diving into a nine-foot vat of Jell-O. 
</P>
<P>
But this is the Beckman, Caltech's airy, wedding cake-shaped auditorium. The 
antic "Steverino" (as one character on "The Tonight Show" used to call him) of 
the 1950s and 1960s seems to have given way in this sedate hall to a pleasant, 
thoughtful social critic. He's here to talk about a deterioration of basic 
intelligence in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Dumbth" (Allen's own term) is a spreading incompetence, illiteracy and 
gullibility across the land. "It's a combination of ignorance and stupidity, 
plus some unidentified ingredients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't any New Jersey cheerleaders here tonight. The sold-out audience of 
1,164 is mostly middle-aged -- many of them scientists, teachers and 
technicians -- with enough concentrated brainpower to turn out an encyclopedia 
in two hours flat. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate in physics, sat in the same row with Paul 
MacCready, the visionary inventor of a human-powered airplane and solar-powered 
car. Caltech faculty and members of Southern California Skeptics, co-sponsor of 
the event and recipient of its proceeds, jammed the center of the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow or other, though, the laughs just kept bubbling up from somewhere in 
Allen's restless psyche. 
</P>
<P>
He handled some written questions from the audience, talking about the sources 
of his inspiration (he doesn't know what they are), his syndicated show "Host 
To Host," shown locally on KABC-TV, and the things that make him laugh (Dan 
Quayle). 
</P>
<P>
"As a group, you're a little on the flaky side," he said, riffling through a 
stack of question cards. He read one of them. " 'What is a semiconductor?' I'll 
give you a definition by example. I would say Lawrence Welk." 
</P>
<P>
Another one, purportedly from Jesus Morales of Tijuana, asked: "If Jesus was 
Jewish, how come he had a Mexican name?" 
</P>
<P>
Then he did what he always appeared most comfortable doing on stage (or screen) 
-- noodling on the Steinway while he gabs into a microphone. "Every few years, 
there's a hit song or two in which the singer's heart is breaking because 
something reminds him of a lost love," Allen said, playing a few bars of "These 
Foolish Things." "But why is it that nobody writes about the bad memories?" 
</P>
<P>
Somebody has, of course. Allen launches into his own version of the 1936 
standard. "A greasy meatball that's all cold and moldy . . . A stupid song 
that's now a golden oldie. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The audience responds as delightedly as if it were 1956 and they had all 
traveled on a lark to the television studio at Rockefeller Center, taking the 
bus through the Lincoln Tunnel or riding the subway in from Brooklyn -- which 
some of them, at earlier times in their lives, actually had done. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised on Steve Allen," said retired physics professor Herb Segall, a 
transplanted New Yorker, after the show. "He was spontaneous, he was witty. . . 
. " Actually, Allen, an owlish man in a plaid jacket, long ago staked a claim 
on the affections of the thinking public. Besides his late-night television 
high jinks, he has written books, scores for musicals, hit songs and a play, 
"The Wake," which won a Los Angeles drama critics' nomination as the best play 
of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who snapped up the tickets for the performance at the Beckman 
remembered him most fondly for creating and hosting the PBS-TV series "Meeting 
of Minds," in which historical figures such as Galileo, Cleopatra, Darwin, 
Ulysses S. Grant and Marie Antoinette talked and debated about international 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always serious, but people didn't know about it," Allen said. "If you do 
a comic monologue, you may be seen by 27 million people, whereas, if you write 
a serious book or a serious song, you may be home alone with a tape recorder or 
a piano."

OPPOSITION TO TEACHER HOUSING AT CHATSWORTH RESERVOIR PROMPTS DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to develop a housing tract for teachers on the city-owned Chatsworth 
Reservoir brought vigorous opposition Tuesday from City Councilman Hal Bernson 
and local homeowner activists -- and denials from the mayor's office that the 
site was being seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said it would be "moronic" for anyone to believe that he or the 
community would tolerate a disruption of the reservoir, a 1,200-acre dry lake 
bed now serving as a wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
"Hiking and bird-watching -- those are the only kinds of things that should be 
permitted there," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Times, quoting City Hall sources, reported last Saturday that the Bradley 
Administration was considering a plan to build up to 5,000 units of low- to 
moderate-cost housing at the reservoir as a way to induce teachers to work in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There goes Bradley again -- the mayor has been totally insensitive to the 
needs of the Valley in the past," said Rita Seashore, vice president of the Oak 
Lake Assn., a group that represents 200 homeowners who reside south of the 
reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"For the mayor to be even considering this . . . is absolutely absurd," said 
Jan Hinkston, a founder of the Santa Susana Mountain Park Assn. "Somebody's off 
their rocker." 
</P>
<P>
The Chatsworth site, owned by the city Department of Water and Power and 
located in the West San Fernando Valley, was used as a reservoir from the 1930s 
until the early 1970s. It has been empty since being damaged in the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake. The site now provides sanctuary for wildlife, primarily for birds, 
including Canada geese. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani denied Tuesday that Bradley's office has seriously 
considered faculty housing for the reservoir. And the mayor sent a two-page 
letter to Bernson assuring the councilman that there "was no basis for the news 
media . . . to suggest that the Chatsworth Reservoir site has been targeted" 
for development. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Bradley wrote that no plan to develop the reservoir would "ever 
have been seriously considered and finalized without the cooperation and 
involvement of your office and interested community groups." 
</P>
<P>
Before a development site could be considered, it first must be determined if 
it would be worthwhile public policy for the city to provide housing incentives 
as a way to lure teachers to jobs in Los Angeles, Fabiani said in an interview 
Tuesday. That threshold decision has not been made yet by the mayor's office, 
the deputy mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
But last week in an interview, Fabiani, in acknowledging that preliminary plans 
were being prepared to have the city promote faculty housing, called the 
Chatsworth Reservoir "the primary site we've focused on so far." He said he 
intended to meet with Bernson and local community groups about this interest. 
"That's the land that's under consideration," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A City Hall source, who asked for anonymity, said Art Gastelum, director of the 
mayor's Office of Economic Development, said the development of faculty housing 
at the reservoir was one of his top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum, who is also the mayor's liaison to the DWP, made the remarks to the 
Office of Economic Development staff in early January, shortly after Bradley 
appointed him to head that unit, the source said. 
</P>

Another of Gastelum's official assignments has been to explore ways to help 
local schools and universities attract top faculty to Los Angeles. One of the 
difficulties facing teacher recruiters has been the area's high housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said Gastelum "originated the idea of teacher incentives, like housing" 
within the Bradley Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"But the fact that that one site may have been mentioned by a single member of 
the mayor's staff does not a proposal make," Fabiani said.

ARMAND HAMMER MUSEUM: WHO PAID FOR WHAT?; 
</P>
<P>
ART: INTERNAL OCCIDENTAL DOCUMENTS INDICATE THAT OFFICIALS MAY HAVE TRANSFERRED 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO OTHER CORPORATE ACCOUNTS TO MEET BUDGET GOAL.

Heavy cost overruns may have caused Occidental Petroleum officials last summer 
to use accounting devices to switch millions of dollars from the Armand Hammer 
Museum of Art and Cultural Center books to other corporate categories. 
</P>
<P>
In order to settle a shareholder suit over financing of the center, Occidental 
had earlier agreed to hold costs for the Westwood facility to $60 million or 
less. To meet the goal, the oil company had to reduce the price of the museum 
by $18.4 million from its highest cost estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the bookkeeping transactions and many other cost-cutting decisions 
are included in internal Occidental documents -- some of them stamped 
"confidential" -- that were obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The documents describe millions of dollars worth of opulent features and 
details originally planned for the museum -- including a $258,000 VIP reception 
lounge, with a $25,000 fireplace, to house Hammer's personal memorabilia; vast 
areas of marble floors, and a radiant heating system for an outdoor courtyard. 
Inclusion of the luxuries had caused the projected museum cost to balloon to 
more than $78.4 million from an originally announced total of $30 million to 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which is under construction in Westwood, is to house the personal 
art collection accumulated by Armand Hammer, 91, Occidental's chairman. He 
announced plans to construct the museum, using Occidental money, two years ago 
after a tiff with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to which Hammer had 
originally pledged his collection. 
</P>
<P>
The budget crisis apparently prompted Occidental to move more than $2 million 
in costs from bookkeeping accounts reserved for the museum to those of Oxy 
Westwood Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates Occidental's 
headquarters building adjacent to the museum site, according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
The papers include memoranda, meeting minutes and internal reports. Occidental 
declined to provide any official to discuss the papers and cost overruns. The 
company also declined to respond to written questions submitted by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"Regarding your questions about the museum," said Occidental spokesman Howard 
Collins, "we will have no comment because of pending litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Gary McCormick, vice president of McCormick Construction Co., the museum's 
general contractor, referred all questions to Occidental. Ronald Asquith, 
Occidental's vice president in charge of the construction, as well as the 
firm's outside construction-cost consultant, Deryl Redden, both failed to 
return calls. 
</P>
<P>
The museum and a subterranean garage are being constructed behind Occidental 
Petroleum's headquarters. The bottom four floors of Occidental's 16-story 
office tower are being gutted for conversion to museum space. The museum and 
office building will be structurally joined. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum officials stepped into the museum cost-overrun situation 
last summer after they agreed to a proposed settlement of a shareholder lawsuit 
filed to block construction of the museum as an inappropriate use of Occidental 
money. Cuts left the museum auditorium, library and restaurant as vacant space. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the cuts, the museum budget was between $1 million and $7 million 
higher than the $60-million objective, which came to be known within Occidental 
as G-Max -- or guaranteed maximum cost. Court records show that the proposed 
settlement would be declared invalid if the total cost for the museum was more 
than $60 million. If the court accepts the settlement, all other litigation 
against the museum would be concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys representing shareholders challenging the museum expenses expressed 
concern that the apparent cost-shifting by Occidental could indicate that the 
proposed settlement had been circumvented. California Deputy Atty. Gen. Susan 
Henrichsen, who represents the California Public Employees Retirement System, 
whose pension plan owns more than 2.4 million shares of Occidental stock, said 
the apparent shifting of costs "is certainly something one would want to know 
more about. If the settlement is not really putting a lid on (the price of the 
museum by artificially shifting budget costs), that's something all the 
shareholders should know." 
</P>
<P>
Henrichsen, however, was cautious. "I would really be surprised if they 
(Occidental) would do anything that bold," she said. "If they simply made a 
bookkeeping transfer to artificially reduce the cost of the museum, I would be 
quite surprised. If there was some bookkeeping transaction (of that nature), 
that would be a real serious indication of further problems." 
</P>
<P>
New York investor Alan R. Kahn, the lead plaintiff in the shareholder 
litigation, asserted that "any attempt to conceal the actual cost (of the 
museum) . . . would, in my opinion, represent an attempt to deceive the court 
in Delaware and Occidental shareholders." Kahn said his attorneys may take up 
the issue of the money transfers with Delaware Vice Chancellor Maurice 
Hartnett, the judge hearing the case in Wilmington, where Occidental is 
incorporated. Hartnett has set an April 4 hearing on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Court documents in the shareholder lawsuit show that, as early as last 
February, Occidental included $5 million in the museum budget for 
reconstruction of existing Occidental building areas as museum space. The 
museum is to have a total of 76,000 square feet of floor space. 
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum reporting on a meeting last Sept. 21, a construction consultant 
noted that a discussion occurred over whether work for Oxy Westwood was to be 
"separated out" of the overall total price of the museum. The minutes indicate 
that the work was to be "excluded from G-Max." Minutes from an Aug. 17 meeting 
show that an accounting transfer of $2,226,066 was approved to shift costs from 
a museum budget to categories associated with Oxy Westwood Corp. The papers 
allude to other transfers as well. 
</P>
<P>
A letter to Hammer last March 8 from Bruce W. McNeil &amp; Associates Co., 
which was employed at the time as the museum construction manager, includes a 
postscript that Oxy Westwood would absorb costs of asbestos removal from the 
second, third and fourth floors of the office building being converted to 
museum space. The letter, which included no amounts for the charges, added that 
Oxy Westwood would absorb costs of refinishing a first-floor entrance to the 
office building and would pay "the museum promotional cost" -- which was not 
defined. Other documents indicate costs originally classified as related to 
museum construction were to be recategorized as for building maintenance and 
renovation or placed in an amorphous "tenant improvements" category. 
</P>
<P>
In the original litigation, stockholders challenged proposed expenditure of a 
total of $85 million by Occidental -- including $60 million in construction 
budget and overrun costs and $25 million in endowment funds. But as 
construction continued, costs rose far above the originally announced total 
that provoked the lawsuit. The museum, at Wilshire and Westwood boulevards, is 
scheduled to open in November. 
</P>
<P>
The papers indicate that the construction budget for the museum, which had 
ballooned to $78.4 million, was to be slashed to $61.8 million under a plan 
discussed in mid-summer. But cost-control problems continued in the following 
weeks. A week before the decision to reassign construction costs to the 
building maintenance and renovation account, the final budget estimate was set 
at $67.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
A budget summary dated Aug. 9 shows savings objectives intended to bring the 
total museum cost down to $59 million -- by making cuts of $7.6 million in 
construction costs and $915,000 by scaling back on furniture, fixtures and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Another summary prepared two days later breaks down the museum's major cost 
elements. They include $27.9 million for the parking garage beneath the museum, 
$25.3 million for the new museum structure itself, $4.1 million in acknowledged 
costs of reconstructing the existing Occidental building for museum use and 
$1.7 million for site preparation. The $59-million total is described in the 
memo as "the most current budget adjustment data for the 1990 plan." The memo 
bears the heading "Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, Budget 
Status, Aug. 11, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
The opulence of planned museum appointments -- many of which became casualties 
of the cost-control drive -- appears to contrast with descriptions of the 
museum's intended operations disclosed earlier in the institution's official 
business plan. The business plan depicts the museum as a lean, entrepreneurial 
venture intended to make large profits. 
</P>
<P>
The business plan, written by Hillary Gibson, a key Hammer aide, projects a 
first-year net of $1.5 million, to be achieved in part by cutting staffing 
levels to the bare bones -- with the museum opening without a full-time curator 
or conservation department and an education staff of one. Part-time workers 
were to be emphasized to avoid paying fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The memoranda and other papers provide new detail on expensive museum 
appointments and architectural features. Many of the items -- like interior 
detail of the museum's restaurant for which an architect received $14,000 -- 
underwent expensive design only to be cut. Other costly features ranged from 
the $80,000 electric radiant heating system and $75,000 for lettering at the 
museum's entrances. The heating system was eliminated and limestone was 
substituted for much of the proposed marble flooring. Changing courtyard floor 
surface materials saved $1 million alone, the documents show. The "Hammer 
Memorabilia Room" and its "Hammer Fireplace" were also cut, the papers show. 
</P>
<P>
The papers also document the extent of Hammer's personal involvement in the 
project -- down to his proposal to reproduce a metal gate he saw at an airport 
in Moscow for use at a museum entrance. Elsewhere in the papers, there is a 
listing for a $60,000 gate that "will be custom metal work, possibly in bronze 
or wrought iron." 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental documents also show that, at a meeting last June 26 that focused 
on a key building permit for the museum that had been delayed, a construction 
official urged a telephone call to City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who 
represents the Westwood area, "to apply some pressure on the (Los Angeles City 
Fire) Department," which had held up permit approval. Hammer, according to 
minutes of the meeting, "instructed (an Occidental official) to give him a memo 
today on this subject so that he could phone the councilman himself." 
</P>
<P>
The meeting minutes include a notation that "Dr. Hammer indicated that the 
councilman was well disposed to aid the project at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's office said that the councilman took action on July 14, writing a 
letter to the fire department that said, "I would appreciate it if the 
necessary clearances . . . could be processed as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Katharine Macdonald, a Yaroslavsky spokeswoman, characterized the letter as 
"absolutely standard." "There's nothing special about it," she said. "It's a 
form of assistance we lend to any large project. It's not a question of asking 
any particular city department to ignore or bypass any steps. 
</P>
<P>
"We're supportive of the project. That's no secret." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of bookkeeping transfers that apparently lowered the cost of the 
Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center is the latest development in 
the evolution of the controversial Westwood museum, creation of which was 
announced two years ago. Armand Hammer, chairman of the Occidental Petroleum 
Corp., which is financing the museum, set up his own museum in a dispute with 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to which Hammer had pledged to donate his 
art collection, estimated to be worth $400 million. Two shareholder lawsuits 
were filed against Occidental Petroleum asserting that the museum was a waste 
of corporate money. Last summer, a tentative settlement was reached in one, but 
a second -- filed by New York investor Alan R. Kahn -- remained. Last year, the 
California Public Employees Retirement System, the state's largest pension 
plan, petitioned to be allowed to enter the case, which is being heard in 
Delaware. Lawyers indicated disclosure of the bookkeeping transfers may prompt 
still additional court action.

CRITIC AT LARGE: THE BAFFLEMENTS OF OSCAR TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As almost every observer has remarked, the single largest astonishment of last 
week's Academy Award nominations is that the Australian director Bruce 
Beresford ("Breaker Morant," "Tender Mercies") was not nominated, although the 
film he directed, "Driving Miss Daisy," received a total of nine, tops for the 
year. No academy vote is without a surprise, sometimes bordering on outrage, 
and that was it. 
</P>
<P>
There was surprise as well that Spike Lee was not nominated for his direction 
of "Do the Right Thing," which had been much honored by critics here in Los 
Angeles and elsewhere. Lee did receive a nomination for his script for the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Like the overlooking of Beresford, who as director bears responsibility for the 
film and all its nominated components, the ignoring of Lee as director seems 
contradictory. What was likable, or unlikable, about "Do the Right Thing," 
began with the script. In so personal a film, the script and the direction were 
in a real sense indivisible. 
</P>
<P>
The list of also-rans, the academy's equivalent of the cutting room floor, is 
piled high with names worthy of nomination. I think among others of Ed Zwick, 
who did so fine a job of mixing scenes of intense intimacy and massive chaotic 
battle in "Glory." 
</P>
<P>
Like many others, I admired "Drugstore Cowboy" for what I think of as its 
demythologizing of the drug scene, examining its low consumer end as the 
symptom of a hollowness and disappointment young people (some of them) appear 
to feel in their society. But the film proved to be invisible in the voting, 
and for the all-too-logical reason that it was not a box-office winner and was 
seen by relatively few voters. 
</P>
<P>
But in reacting to the nominations there is a distinction to be made between 
personal preferences that the voters didn't agree with, and a large bafflement 
like the overlooking of Beresford. 
</P>
<P>
Beresford, who became available for "Driving Miss Daisy" when a film he was to 
do for Dino De Laurentiis collapsed, worked closely with Alfred Uhry on the 
script. Because no one would finance the film at the relatively modest figure 
-- $12 million -- at which it was originally budgeted, Beresford helped plan 
the production changes that cut the costs by nearly a third. The contradictions 
in the nominating process arise, as ever, because directors vote for directors, 
writers for writers, actors for actors, and so on, while everybody gets a shot 
at best picture. The branches vary widely in population, with the actors 
numbering more than 2,000 and some of the technical branches with only a few 
dozen voters. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the writers have been the least tethered and the most 
adventurous of the branches (or so it has seemed to me) and thus the nomination 
for Lee in their category. 
</P>
<P>
Considered historically, the academy voting has become broader and more 
democratic over the years, and also more internationally-minded, as witness 
1987 when the directors failed to nominate a single U.S.-born director. 
</P>
<P>
This year's tally of 4,900 voters is a modern record, probably double what it 
was a quarter-century ago. The academy leadership has tried hard to make the 
voting fairer and more representative of the industry as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
While some of the branches still have a clubby feeling in which new boys and 
girls have to wait their turn for honors, the voting generally is free of the 
influence of studios, as it was not in the past. 
</P>
<P>
But what remains true is that the Motion Picture Academy, like all academies of 
honor, reflects an older, more conservative viewpoint. An academy of creative 
craftsmanship inevitably rates craft highly -- higher than trenchant social 
commentary, especially when the commentary is toned with anger, criticism and 
pessimism. Especially pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
The voters clearly respect success, yet it's too easy to dismiss the Oscars as 
a popularity contest. Too many big box-office winners ("Batman" this year) are 
ignored. The likelier explanation is that more voters get to see the good films 
that are also long-running hits. The good, tough little film that doesn't make 
it into citywide release continues to be the academy's prime casualty. 
</P>
<P>
As in any election, subjective matters come into play. There are times when the 
academy voters seem to play share-the-wealth, overlooking certain achievements 
because the achiever has been honored recently before. And now and again a 
nomination and indeed an Oscar can only be interpreted as honoring not just the 
immediate achievement but a life's work (e.g., John Wayne in "True Grit"). 
</P>
<P>
The vote-out, so to speak, between "Born on the Fourth of July" and "Driving 
Miss Daisy," as the final ballot promises to be, will be a fascinating study in 
the academy's psychology. The choice would be between the angers, triumphantly 
resolved, of Oliver Stone's look at the traumas of Vietnam, against the warm 
humanism of "Daisy," with its subtle-enough reminders that there were hatreds 
and prejudices just up the street and that the standard status quo was not 
necessarily wonderful, even for wise chauffeurs. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, all the analysis of the nominating process does not really explain 
the bypassing of Beresford by his fellow directors. Did it seem that with a 
sure-fire script and two (or four) wonderful performers, the director only had 
to call "Action" and "Cut"? The directors, of all groups, ought to know better.

With a double dose of "The Cosby Show" and a strong showing from its crime 
drama "Blind Faith," NBC dominated the prime-time ratings last week, wracking 
up its 18th consecutive victory in the process. NBC's fare had an average 
audience of 14.5 million homes, compared to 11.6 million for ABC and 11.1 
million for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The conclusion of "Blind Faith" even beat the top-rated "Roseanne" on Tuesday, 
knocking the ABC sitcom to No. 7 for the week. Among other specials, the first 
part of ABC's miniseries "The Kennedys of Massachusetts" placed No. 21, beating 
"The Death of the Incredible Hulk" on NBC, which was No. 25. CBS' reunion of 
"The Love Boat" finished 38th. The full list of ratings is on page 12. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Simpsons" continued as Fox Broadcasting's hottest show, tying for No. 24 
out of 84 prime-time programs and finishing second in its Sunday-night time 
period behind CBS' "The Color Purple." The show did even better in the Los 
Angeles television market, however, where the animated half hour was the third 
most-watched show of the week.

'CHEERS' ON OPENING NIGHT OF TELEVISION FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kirstie Alley, Ted Danson, and Shelley Long will discuss "Cheers" on the 
opening night of the Museum of Broadcasting's 7th annual Television Festival in 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Leo S. Bing Theater on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
They will answer audience questions after a tape of the show's highlights is 
screened starting at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

MIKE DOWNEY: ROAD TO DRAFT SHOULDN'T BE ONE-WAY STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Larry Smith has the very best interests of his USC football players at heart. I 
think anybody who knows anybody at the university would tell you that. 
</P>
<P>
That's why I sincerely hope that the coach changes his mind about striking back 
at the National Football League for tampering with undergraduates by not giving 
scouts easy access to practices, films, stopwatch-timings, etc., that involve 
USC's players. 
</P>
<P>
I do not believe you can hurt the NFL that way. But I do believe you can hurt 
the kids that way, and even hurt yourself that way, once unscrupulous agents or 
ambitious opposing coaches decide to use your methods against you. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose somebody is trying to keep some kid away from USC. All he would have to 
do is sprinkle doubt inside the kid's head, distort the facts to convince the 
kid that, by playing for Larry Smith, his path to pro football will be doubly 
difficult to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
It's a lie, of course, but many a young man's head has been turned by a 
misrepresentation of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Listen, maybe it hurts a coach to lose the likes of a Barry Sanders or a Major 
Harris or a Junior Seau before his college eligibility has run out, but there 
is no sense compounding the problem by warring with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
The seniors-only eligibility rule was a Berlin Wall that needed to come 
tumbling down. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot create a world that is more fair to baseball, basketball and hockey 
players than it is to football players. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot ask football players to continue to help raise money for America's 
university and then deny them the privilege of any free American to work for 
anybody, anytime, past the age of 16. 
</P>
<P>
Football players are people, too. They have a Constitutional right to make up 
their own minds. They should not be punished just because they don't have a 
minor league farm system the way the baseball players do, or junior hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Why should Jennifer Capriati, at 13, be able to play professional tennis, while 
a third-year college student is forbidden to play professional football? She's 
getting rich, and they're playing for room and board. 
</P>
<P>
College shouldn't be something a person cannot leave without permission, like 
an Army hitch or prison term. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA finally got around a week or so ago to permitting juniors to turn pro 
without needing special dispensation. To qualify for the 1990 draft, all a kid 
need have done was be enrolled in school in the fall of 1987. And, he must 
declare himself -- as Harris and Seau have -- by March 22. 
</P>
<P>
There is one other catch, though, and it is a reprehensible one: 
</P>
<P>
The athlete must renounce all subsequent college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Why must we inflict these ties that bind? Why must there always be rules so 
strict, so confining? 
</P>
<P>
As NCAA Executive Director Dick Schultz now says -- seconded, by the way, by 
Smith and other coaches -- football players should be free to be drafted, just 
as baseball and hockey players are, to get an idea of what their market value 
would be, just so long as they do not sign contracts with any agents or teams. 
</P>
<P>
Simple. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Peete would have never been able to come back and play quarterback and 
lead USC into another Rose Bowl if his eligibility had been stripped from him 
for having been picked by the Oakland Athletics in an amateur baseball player 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
And, Peete could have been spared the indignity of last year's NFL draft 
circumstances if he had been an undergraduate trying to decide what to do. By 
being able to test the waters without giving up his senior year, Peete would 
have known that his NFL value was as a sixth-round pick, not a first-round 
pick. He could have acted accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Junior Seau could be doing right now, if the NFL and NCAA would stop 
butting heads. If Junior the junior could try the NFL draft, could wait to see 
how high he is drafted, then, like any other free and thinking individual, he 
could stay in college if he so chose. 
</P>
<P>
What the NFL is doing, in effect, is expelling Junior Seau from school. And 
Major Harris, the Heisman Trophy hopeful from West Virginia. And Scott 
Mitchell, the outstanding quarterback from Utah. And maybe, before this thing 
is through, Mark Carrier, the first-rate defensive back from USC. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith, certainly a clear thinker, was hardly a happy man on the day he 
lost his All-American linebacker. He wasn't unhappy with Seau; he was unhappy 
with the system. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL has its head in the sand," Smith said. "They say they don't want 
underclassmen, but what have they done about it? 
</P>
<P>
"The manipulation starts with the agents. There's no law that stops them from 
calling these kids and letting them know what they're worth. There's got to be 
drastic changes in the NCAA and NFL. There have got to be tighter controls over 
tapes and films and who comes to view practice." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has given some thought to keeping pro scouts away from his players. Not 
just agents, but scouts. As with John Thompson of Georgetown, who was dead-set 
against Proposition 48, the USC coach presumably figures it will take a 
drastic, dramatic action on his part to get the NCAA's and NFL's attention. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want him to go too far, because I don't want it to be used against USC. 
</P>
<P>
But, here's hoping his message penetrates some of those thick NFL and NCAA 
skulls. What we want -- what we need -- is one draft, one draft that excludes 
nobody, one draft that accommodates everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Give athletes options, not orders.

RIVIERA COURSE EVOKES BEST OF GOLF TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. OPEN: FOR CRENSHAW, WHO REVERES GAME, THIS EVENT IS A MUST. BUT SIX IN 
LAST YEAR'S TOP 10 ARE NOT ENTERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ben Crenshaw is a golf traditionalist, a player who reveres the legendary 
aspect of the game -- and some of the courses that have their own distinct 
personality and mystique. 
</P>
<P>
And there is one stop on the PGA Tour that is a must for Crenshaw. It's the 
Riviera Country Club, where the Nissan Los Angeles Open will be played this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw has played Riviera every year he has been on the tour, starting in 
1974. He is here again, stimulated as always by the historic course that was a 
favorite track of Ben Hogan, Sam Snead and other legends of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain places where guys would love to win and this is one of 
them," Crenshaw said. "Everyone coming here, even the younger players who 
haven't seen it, are going to say this is a special place. 
</P>
<P>
"You can throw money out the window. People would give their eyeteeth just to 
win here." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw's passion for Riviera hasn't been returned. He has never won here in 
an otherwise productive career. 
</P>
<P>
The closest he came was in 1987, when he lost in a playoff with T. C. Chen. It 
seemed that he was on the verge of his first victory in 1988 when he shot 69-64 
for the first two rounds, then faltered. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Crenshaw, 38, will keep wooing the the grand old lady of the Pacific 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
"Hogan and Snead always had a healthy respect for this golf course, which is 
relatively timeless," Crenshaw said. "There is a great legacy about it." 
</P>
<P>
The course was completed in 1927 and, like the Coliseum, is one of the city's 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
That the course is relatively unchanged since MacDonald Smith won the first 
L.A. Open in 1929 appeals to Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"The shot values are real solid," he said. "You have little finesse shots and 
you also have to drive it well. The old cliche about using every club in the 
bag literally applies here." 
</P>
<P>
As Crenshaw played a practice round, he explained the subtleties of the course. 
</P>
<P>
"It is laid out in angles," he said. "There is always a way in and a way out, 
even in inclement weather. The course gives you many options. It's really an 
outdoors chess game." 
</P>
<P>
As Crenshaw walked, he pointed out the contours in the fairways, the tilted 
greens and the bunkers that blend with the landscape, unlike those that stick 
out on more modern courses. 
</P>
<P>
There is, of course, the famous par-three sixth hole with a bunker in the 
middle of the green. 
</P>
<P>
"But it looks like it should be there," Crenshaw said. "It's proportionately 
beautiful and it divides the green." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw then stroked a putt around the bunker and toward the pin behind it, 
demonstrating that there is always a way in and a way out for the skilled 
player, or even the high handicap golfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to sound jaded, but I don't get to many places where I get 
stimulated like I do here," he said. "Riviera will always be on my schedule, no 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
However, it isn't on the schedule of six of the top-10 money winners last year 
-- Payne Stewart, Paul Azinger, Greg Norman, Tim Simpson, Curtis Strange and 
Scott Hoch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my position to criticize," Crenshaw said. "However, it's my opinion, 
and it's shared by a few others, that you have to make room for a place like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw, one of the game's best putters, has 14 tour victories in 17 years on 
the tour, but he hasn't been been among the top 10 in the three tournaments he 
has played this year -- Phoenix, Pebble Beach and the Hawaiian Open. 
</P>
<P>
But he is reasonably satisfied with his game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've hit some good shots, but I haven't found my scoring yet," he said. "Not 
enough birdies. My putting hasn't been good." 
</P>
<P>
And he says it's more difficult than ever to win. "There is much more depth now 
and guys shoot phenomenal scores in all kinds of conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Riviera has given up its share of low 60s, too. But to Crenshaw, it has 
maintained a standard. 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Lanny Wadkins earned $3,000 by winning the Merrill Lynch Shoot-Out Tuesday at 
Riviera. Wadkins and Tom Sieckmann each parred the 18th hole and then Wadkins 
won in a chip-off by sinking a 40 footer. . . . Duffy Waldorf, former UCLA golf 
star, won the long driving contest with a drive of 296 yards. He earned $3,500. 
Jim Lampley of KCBS-TV won the celebrity portion with a drive of 241 yards. . . 
. The celebrity pro-am will be held today.

FAMILY SAYS DRUG TEST FALSIFIED; 
</P>
<P>
MOTOR RACING: RICHMOND'S PARENTS CHARGE THAT NASCAR OFFICIALS AND THEIR FORMER 
DRUG ADVISER, FOREST TENNANT, USED FALSE TESTS TO BAN DRIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Late in 1986, stock car driver Tim Richmond was hospitalized for pneumonia. 
But, as he soon discovered, that was secondary to a more serious illness: He 
was diagnosed with AIDS, the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, 31 at the time, did not want to quit racing. And he did not. He was 
named NASCAR's driver of the year for 1986, and planned to continue driving for 
as long as his strength would last. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not AIDS that knocked him out of racing. In February of 1988, 
Richmond was suspended by NASCAR officials just before the Daytona 500 because 
a drug test reportedly showed he had used illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months later, Richmond died from AIDS after having spent much of his 
last year in seclusion in southern Florida. His doctor said last year that 
Richmond contracted AIDS from a woman who had the disease. 
</P>
<P>
And now, his parents, Al and Evelyn Richmond of Ashland, Ohio, and others 
contend that NASCAR officials and their former drug adviser, Dr. Forest S. 
Tennant, used false test results to ban Richmond and ultimately end his career. 
</P>
<P>
Tennant, executive director of Community Health Projects of West Covina, has 
come under criticism for his handling of drug tests as the National Football 
League's drug adviser. Tennant left NASCAR last summer in what officials termed 
an amicable parting. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with Tennant's former employees and sealed court documents obtained 
by Washington television reporter Roberta Baskin corroborated charges 
Richmond's parents made Tuesday that negative tests were publicly reported as 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, who challenged the findings in a $20-million lawsuit that was settled 
out of court, never raced again. 
</P>
<P>
"They ruined his character," Evelyn Richmond said Tuesday, breaking three years 
of silence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really damaging because it was a big enough kick that he had AIDS 
without being (charged) with a false drug test. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim demanded to be tested because of the rumor. They took him into a trailer 
and had him urinate over a 55-gallon drum into a bottle with some of the NASCAR 
officials standing there watching. That was humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Tennant said the drug test was a minor part of his 
recommendation to disallow Richmond from racing. 
</P>
<P>
"To bring up the Tim Richmond case now, with everything that has happened, is 
sickening," Tennant said. "There is a doctor-patient confidentiality here. But 
we're talking about a very sick human being at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant said his role with Richmond was minor. He also said he could not 
remember the test result except that it was positive. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, who was NASCAR's first driver to be tested under a program devised by 
Tennant, was first reported to have produced positive results for two drugs on 
NASCAR's prohibited substance list that included cocaine, marijuana and 
opiates. 
</P>
<P>
According to Baskin's report on station WJLA Tuesday night, a court document 
revealed that Tennant had told NASCAR officials that the two substances were 
amphetamines and opiates. 
</P>
<P>
Sources who have knowledge of the test say that test actually produced negative 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Les Richter, vice president of competition for NASCAR said he is bound by a 
court order not to discuss Richmond's case. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond asked for a second test when the first was reported as positive. He 
knew something NASCAR officials did not: He was clean. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond had first been tested by his personal physician, David Dodson, an 
infectious disease specialist from West Palm Beach, Fla., a few days before 
NASCAR's test. 
</P>
<P>
Before taking the NASCAR test Richmond wanted to make sure he no longer had the 
drug AZT (azidothymidine) in his system, Evelyn Richmond said. AZT has proven 
effective in delaying the progression of HTLV-III, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS victims usually contract the disease from sexual relations with those who 
have the disease, blood transfusions or contaminated needles. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Richmond said that her son did not want the public to know about his 
disease, and thus stopped taking AZT six weeks before the Daytona 500 to ensure 
a clean test result. The drug AZT would have been detected had it remained in 
his system. 
</P>
<P>
Dodson said Tuesday that Richmond was clean except for some caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
"He was suspicious of NASCAR, so we did a test," Dodson said. "I was absolutely 
surprised when I saw (NASCAR's announced positive). "He took some Sudafed and 
Advil. Advil can give an initial false positive for opiates. I told him that 
when Tim called. I was surprised he had taken anything period." 
</P>
<P>
Once NASCAR officials realized that Richmond had an official negative result, 
they changed their position, saying that his positive findings were caused by 
the over-the-counter nonprescription drugs Sudafed and Advil. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Douglas Rollins, director of the Center of Human Toxicology at the 
University of Utah, said such drugs cannot be accurately gauged by an EMIT 
screen test, which was used in Tennant's laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
"If the tests were done by a certified laboratory, they would have been done by 
a screening test followed by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in which 
case the mistake would not have been made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is the most expensive but 
considered the most accurate testing system. Community Health Projects did not 
use the GC/MS method when Richmond was tested, according to Bobby Tovar, one of 
two laboratory technicians at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The EMIT process basically uses light to read through certain chemicals. Tovar 
said he calibrated his instrument to test Richmond's specimen for marijuana and 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Tovar said he tested Richmond's second sample, which he picked up at the 
airport. He said the specimen was marked with Richmond's name. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim was a driver on his way up," Tovar said. "They had suspected he was under 
the influence. A urine sample was sent, I picked it up, ran the test and it 
came back negative." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual procedure according to drug-testing standards, that sample was 
retested by another technician two days later, Tovar said. It again was found 
to be negative. 
</P>
<P>
But further testing resulted in the presence of Sudafed, which Tennant reported 
as being five to 20 times the normal dose. Traces of ibuprofen (Advil) also 
were found. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the drugs were found in the first or second sample could not be 
determined. Tennant said he does not remember the details of the test. Tovar 
said he did not deal with the test after reporting his initial results to 
Tennant. 
</P>
<P>
NASCAR officials subsequently reinstated Richmond but said he could not race 
without releasing his medical records. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond declined because of his disease, and countered with a suit claiming 
that NASCAR had released unsubstantiated information prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
Richter, who refused to discuss the case, admitted he was one of two auto 
racing officials trained at Community Health Projects by one of Tennant's 
assistants, Gordon Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith has been characterized by Tennant as a disgruntled former employee. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith currently is a defendant in a 1 1/2-year-old criminal suit in West 
Covina Municipal Court. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has 
charged Griffith with making threatening and annoying telephone calls to 
Tennant's home. The case, which has been postponed several times, is scheduled 
to go to trial March 1. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith said in an interview last summer that he had trained Richter and Chip 
Williams, NASCAR's public relations director. He said Richter told him that 
Bill France Jr., NASCAR president, wanted to construct a drug program to 
disqualify Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill's concerned we got one person (Richmond) in particular who is really 
outspoken and he is somewhat bizarre so he must be a drug user," Griffith said 
Richter told him. "We don't know so we're setting up a drug program so we can 
catch him." 
</P>
<P>
Richter would not elaborate on his training sessions with Griffith and what was 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Richmond said that NASCAR officials mistook the symptoms of Richmond's 
AIDS for symptoms of being on drugs. She said her son and the officials had 
long been at odds. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not homosexual and he never used a needle. (But) Tim lived in the fast 
lane, there's no doubt about it," she said. "He knew they would pull something 
like this. Tim and NASCAR did not get along because Tim was a person who told 
it like it was." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Richmond claims her son was not a drug user. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so devastated by having the disease that I can't even find the words to 
explain how he felt," she said. "With his illness, he was very, very angry. He 
was angry at God, he was angry at everything. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't come across too pleasant many times. Nonetheless he had the talent 
and he was a very good driver . . . along with being a caring, kind person." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond first drove a super-modified stock car in 1977. The next year he was 
the United States Auto Club's sprint car rookie of the year. Also in 1978, he 
attended Jim Russell's driving school at Willow Springs International Raceway 
and became the fastest student in school history. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the 1980 Indy 500 after having run in only five Indy-style races, 
and posted the fastest time in the month during practice. He finished ninth and 
was voted rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He started racing stock cars in 1980, and joined the NASCAR circuit full time 
the next year. In parts of eight NASCAR seasons he won 13 races and $2,228,558. 
</P>
<P>
Richmond's personality, however, never endeared him to NASCAR veterans. He was 
called "Hollywood" by his peers because of his shoulder-length hair, bushy 
mustache, dark glasses and dress that was different from that worn by most of 
the Southeastern stock car community. 
</P>
<P>
He often was accompanied by glamorous women at racing events and parties. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Richmond said Tim's conflict with NASCAR began after he blew a tire at 
Daytona early in his career. She said Richmond had difficulties being admitted 
to a local hospital although he was injured. Evelyn, who accompanied her son to 
the hospital, said Tim caused a ruckus when a security guard tried to stop him 
from entering. 
</P>
<P>
"Had he not had the virus, NASCAR would have killed his occupation (anyway)," 
Evelyn Richmond said. "And to say nothing of what this did to his illness and 
to the remaining days of his life." 
</P>
<P>
The Richmonds said that in the end, their son was too weak to fight NASCAR. And 
as a result, that he died with his secret.

LIONEL SIMMONS: AMAZING ABILITY, MODEST ATTITUDE

<P>
It is hard for La Salle forward Lionel Simmons to look his successes squarely 
in the eye and accept the breadth of his accomplishments -- including his 
pending status as the fifth NCAA player to score 3,000 points and the only one 
to also have 1,300 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is because he has spent most of his life flinching from shadows that 
threatened to engulf him at times. There was the hardscrabble neighborhood that 
contributed to two brothers going to jail. Simmons escaped the streets through 
basketball, but even there he often stepped back behind more highly regarded 
players. 
</P>
<P>
At La Salle, the 21 year old plays home games at the Civic Center, a grand old 
building that resounds with memories of legendary performances by former 
Explorers star Tom Gola and Wilt Chamberlain of the then-Philadelphia Warriors. 
Simmons has held his own. An all-America, he could have had financial security 
from the NBA last season but decided against going to the pros early -- 
partially because he was uncertain how he would adapt to the lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Now a senior and projected as a lottery pick, Simmons will surely be in the NBA 
next season, just as surely as he will reach the 3,000-point mark -- he has 
2,963 entering Tuesday's game against Loyola Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Both events will push him more into the limelight, but he also appears more 
willing to meet that light. The man who was on the verge of tears two years ago 
after being forced to spend 10 days in Italy, now says he doesn't want to play 
in Philadelphia, that it's time to move on and see another part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Should he end up with the 76ers, Simmons added, "I'll be highly upset." A smile 
flickered on his lips, the joke being that Philadelphia doesn't have a number 
one pick in June. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at yourself, at the position you're in and you just don't think of 
being on that level -- you're amazed," he said. "I guess all athletes dream of 
it happening to them but it doesn't for most. And for me, I'm just -- it's 
amazing. Like when people talk about getting 3,000 points; to me I'm just 
playing basketball, then you look at the people you're passing and you just 
don't think of yourself as the same caliber as them." 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State's Pete Maravich, Portland State's Freeman Williams, Texas 
Southern's Harry Kelly and Bradley's Hersey Hawkins are the other players to 
reach 3,000 points, each remembered for outrageous scoring binges. Unlike them, 
or current LSU guard Chris Jackson who seems able to pick up 40 points at will, 
Simmons has amassed his total with a layup here and a tipin there. 
</P>
<P>
A starter for every one of his 122 games at La Salle, Simmons averages an 
economical 18 shots per contest. His 40 points against Manhattan on Feb. 10 was 
his career high. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet 7, 220 pounds, Simmons can put the ball on the floor and make passes 
from the top of the key to teammates cutting underneath. He's hit 62 percent of 
his three-point attempts this season for the Explorers, who are 22-1 and ranked 
14th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of people growing up want to be like a certain player, emulating 
him in any way possible," Simmons said. "I tried to watch and take certain 
things from certain players and put it all together. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked to pass -- that may sound weird, with me scoring 3,000 
points -- but watching Magic (Johnson, 6-9 guard of the Los Angeles Lakers), an 
unselfish player who's willing to pass before he takes a shot and is perceived 
as being great because of it -- I tried to take that. When Moses (Malone, 
formerly with the 76ers) was here, he was rewarded for being a rebounder, so I 
try to rebound as best I can." 
</P>
<P>
This season, Simmons is averaging 26.1 points, 10.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.9 
blocked shots and 1.6 steals. But while his all-around brilliance and 
reputation as a thinking man's player endears him to the pros, it has not 
catapulted him into the national consciousness like Jackson or, closer to home, 
Bo Kimble, a friend from the South Philly days who averages more than 35 points 
a game for Loyola Marymount in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said he believes the lack of attention makes him work harder. Fans in 
the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, where Simmons is sure to win a third 
straight most valuable player award, obviously know who he is, taunting him 
with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
When he plays against more renowned schools, whose players and fans don't look 
upon him as anything special, that's motivation to excel. The ploy works, as a 
Dean E. Smith Center record 37 points against North Carolina attests. 
</P>
<P>
It's apparent that being unappreciated is one of the few areas that can alter 
Simmons's easy-going nature. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Macon, a guard for city rival Temple, reaped most of the attention two 
years ago by averaging more than 23 points a game and leading the Owls to the 
top of the collegiate polls during a sensational debut season. 
</P>
<P>
"His freshman year he got all the publicity. My stats were better but because 
he came in as this high school all-America, blue-chip player it was always, 
'Mark Macon this, he's the man,' " Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Playing against older kids during grade school, by all accounts, Simmons was 
usually the last one picked. At South Philadelphia High School, he led the city 
in scoring twice but met indifferent recruiting from the national basketball 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
His coach at La Salle, Speedy Morris, said Simmons "underestimated" his talents 
in deciding to stay in the city to play collegiately. 
</P>
<P>
What seems clear now, however, is the manifest destiny that brought Simmons, a 
player looking to stay home, to La Salle, a home looking for a heart. 
</P>
<P>
With players like Gola and former all-America Michael Brooks, and coaches like 
Paul Westhead, the Explorers have a rich basketball history, but times changed. 
The allure of the Big Five, the union of city schools La Salle, Temple, St. 
Joseph's, Penn and Villanova has crumbled in the face of interest in national 
conferences such as the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
That led the outstanding talent in Philadelphia to head elsewhere. Kimble and 
Hank Gaithers (who led the nation in scoring and rebounding last season) went 
to Southern Cal then transferred to Loyola Marymount; Pooh Richardson, perhaps 
the best schoolboy guard in the nation, chose UCLA and Brian Shorter picked 
Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons and Morris, also a Philadelphia native, have a relationship that seems 
closer to family than player and coach. The same sense of kinship permeates the 
La Salle team. 
</P>
<P>
There are only 13 players on the Explorers and, as they stretched in a ragged 
circle near midcourt before a recent practice, they looked more like guys 
rapping before a pickup game than a nationally ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you'd never know that we were (22-1)," cracked team manager Brian 
Morris, the coach's son and a freshman at La Salle. Another son, Keith, is 
reserve point guard. 
</P>
<P>
The music in the background continued to blare when the workout began. The La 
Salle players drifted in and out of the gym for rest-room stops and to complain 
about assorted injuries. Speedy Morris began the practice by saying, "Here we 
go, let's get it on," then sat on the sidelines for most of the next two hours, 
mainly offering asides as assistants Joe Mihalich and Randy Monroe ran drills. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons doesn't seem any different than the other players, in fact on this day 
he was the main object of ridicule, his teammates cheering wildly when he was 
dunked on during a one-on-one drill, then jeering him when he botched a slang 
phrase. 
</P>
<P>
The looseness does seems odd for a top-20 team and Mihalich said the Explorers 
"are still searching for our place nationally." La Salle has a 92-30 record 
since Simmons and Morris arrived, but in the opening round of the last two NCAA 
tournaments has lost to Kansas State and Louisiana Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics point out that La Salle's gaudy record is the result of the MAAC's 
mediocre play, but the coaches point to victories over De Paul, Ohio State, 
Notre Dame and Temple (its lone loss was 121-116 to No. 18 Loyola Marymount) 
and say the team not only knows when it's time to play but also how to play 
against high-powered opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons said the knowledge that La Salle would be good this season made the 
decision to turn down the NBA last year easier. A bigger factor, though, was a 
promise to his mother during his freshman year that he would get his degree. 
He's on track to do that in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was a little scared of the work at first," he said. "I came from an 
inner-city school, was surrounded by a totally different environment. The 
students here came from middle-class schools -- I thought there'd be a dropoff 
with me. I told my mom that I couldn't do it; she got on me and I got some 
confidence and I said 'I'll bet you I graduate,' and it's just stuck with me 
since." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the first time mother and son helped pull each other through tough 
times. The youngest of five children, Lionel watched the effect on Ruth Simmons 
as his brothers Amos and Roscoe were jailed for a variety of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why he turned out different," Ruth Simmons said. "Maybe their 
experience taught him, maybe he saw the suffering I went through. I told him 
that I couldn't take it, I couldn't go through it again and I guess he wanted 
to do something better for me." 
</P>
<P>
Lionel Simmons agreed, adding that another reason was that he was "too scared" 
of the alternatives to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
That fear has helped place him on the verge of basketball history. A 24-point 
effort Sunday against Fairfield sent him into sixth place on the NCAA's 
all-time scoring list and left him 37 points short of the 3,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
But unless he's having a big night and Loyola of Maryland is on the verge of 
upsetting La Salle, Simmons won't join that exclusive club in Baltimore Tuesday 
night. The Explorers host Manhattan on Thursday; the following day, Ruth 
Simmons is scheduled to take a ski trip to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd miss that ski trip before she'd miss me getting the 3,000th point," 
Lionel Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to get it for me on Thursday against Manhattan," said Ruth Simmons. 
"But he's right."

MEXICAN ANGLERS ARE HOOKED ON SQUID;

<P>
FISHING: PRESENCE OF THESE FIDGETY CREATURES IS OFFERING A CHANGE OF PACE FOR 
RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LA PAZ, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several small boats are clumped together in one area of an otherwise deserted 
stretch of sea, the fishermen expressionless as they use their hands in a 
sweeping motion to pull their lines from the depths. 
</P>
<P>
At first sight, a normal looking scene. But upon closer inspection, it becomes 
obvious that these fishermen are hauling up slithering globs of something red 
and rubbery. 
</P>
<P>
Cephalopods! It's squid, as unsettling a creature as there is in all creation. 
</P>
<P>
Some go four feet long and weigh 40 pounds. They have eyes as big as billiard 
balls, with a stare incessantly blank. 
</P>
<P>
The water is thick with these 10-tentacled torpedoes. They are brought to the 
surface in great numbers. They try to escape, collapsing their bodies with such 
force that they send jets of water in every direction. Some expel large clouds 
of black ink, as if to purposely make a mess of things. 
</P>
<P>
They writhe and squirm when stuck by the gaff, their blood-red color flowing 
the length of their slender bodies as they are hauled over the rail. Their 
tentacles probe desperately for any possible means of escape. It's a sticky 
situation to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, send it down," Mario Coppola says, instructing one already intrigued 
fisherman aboard one of Coppola's fleet of panga boats. The fisherman has 
brought along a conventional rig, a rod and reel. Guide Marcello Geraldo has 
baited the angler's iron jig with a strip of freshly cut squid and tosses it 
over the rail. "They think very highly of themselves," Coppola jokes of the 
species' apparent cannibalism. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola then sends down a rig of his own, as does Geraldo. 
</P>
<P>
A slow and steady tug from 80 feet below indicates a strike. What ensues is not 
a fierce battle, though, but a challenging one nevertheless. Pumping and 
reeling, as one would a fish, is futile. Too much pressure and the hook tears 
from the squid's clammy flesh. The fidgety animal often spits the hook but, 
reluctant to let go of its meal, it waits to be brought to the surface, then 
spits the presentation back at the presenter. 
</P>
<P>
Several are lost before the game is figured out: It takes a steady yet slow 
pressure, like that used by the commercial hand-line fishermen, to bring a 
squid to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of jumbo squid in the gulf represents another way for the local 
commercial fishing fleet to make money, one that entails little work and brings 
fair return. And in most seasons, one that should have ended months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They should be in Costa Rica right now," says Coppola, 40, whose family-owned 
Los Arcos Hotel in town is headquarters for his fleet of pangas. "They just 
haven't left. We had the same phenomena about eight years ago. They were almost 
all the way up to San Felipe." 
</P>
<P>
The squid remained in the gulf for three years, even though the Mexican 
government contracted the services of a Korean fishing vessel, which used its 
bright lights to attract them to the surface and its sophisticated gear to pull 
them out by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
"We were eating squid in this town like jerky," Coppola recalls with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric Hochberg, curator of the Department of Invertebrates at the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History, remembered the phenomenon Coppola spoke of 
and said that the squid may be here to stay, for a while anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know quite what's going on there," he said. "We think there probably 
got to be some oceanographic conditions that are setting the population up in 
that area, because normally that (type of) squid is found down off the coast of 
South America." 
</P>
<P>
Hochberg said the squid made it as far north as Southern California during El 
Nino, the warm-water condition several years ago, adding, "It's probably 
something associated with that phenomenon that brings them into the (Sea of 
Cortez) and they're able to grow and probably reproduce in that area for a few 
years until the conditions change or the population dies down." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the presence of squid represents a change of pace for the 
recreational fisherman, a chance of doing battle with a legendary creature that 
at one time was labeled a sea monster. 
</P>
<P>
At times during the late summer and fall the squid were so thick that calamari 
steaks were replacing the fish fillets on the seaside cutting boards. 
Apparently, they still inhabit a wide section of the Sea of Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still catching them," says Richard Castanada of the Hotel SPA 
Buenavista, a resort 65 miles south of La Paz. "I've heard of instances where 
guys were trolling marlin lures and those things would come up and strike the 
marlin lures. It's awesome. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these guys are just having a ball, yo-yoing jigs up and down and just 
getting nailed, because they put up a hell of a fight." 
</P>
<P>
But most agree that the novelty of catching squid is generally a short-lived 
one among the more serious fishermen. Marlin fishermen consider them pests 
because billfish gorge themselves on squid and become reluctant to eat anything 
else. Others would rather fish with light tackle for the acrobatic dorado, or 
use the heavy stuff for the razor-toothed and powerful wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
The three islands outside La Paz -- Espiritu de Santo, Partida and Cerralvo -- 
are home to a wide variety of near-shore game fish and rockfish, including one 
of Coppola's favorites, the pargo. 
</P>
<P>
"A very, very good fighter," he says. "They're monstrous, very strong." 
</P>
<P>
That became apparent when a trolled Rapala lure along the rocky coast of 
Cerralvo produced a three-pound sierra mackerel, which generated an 
uncharacteristic burst of speed after apparently tiring during its struggle. A 
giant pargo chased it to the surface and lunged at it so fiercely that a huge 
swirling splash broke what had been a soothing silence and sent an aftershock 
of a wake that nearly rocked the small boat 30 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
The pargo missed. 
</P>
<P>
"One hell of a different ballgame," said Coppola, whose hotel display boards 
are littered with photographs of arm-weary customers holding up these red and 
ash-red snappers. Many weighed more than 60 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The lure was thrown back over and within minutes a six-pound roosterfish was 
landed. Moments later, Coppola brought over the rail a small cabrilla. 
</P>
<P>
Sportfishermen discovered this city's game fish possibilities in the 1950s and 
La Paz quickly became known as one of the world's great billfish resorts. The 
influx of tourists was assured for the capital of Baja California Sur. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years the government has focused most of its attention -- and 
budget -- on Cabo San Lucas as a means of attracting the fisherman-tourist. The 
resort is where the famous weather-carved arches signify land's end. Many of 
the locals are at their wits' end as to how the city can keep up with the 
demands of such development. 
</P>
<P>
Sewage problems are on the rise. Water and electricity demands are up. The list 
goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for them," Coppola says. "La Paz is developing by itself, so from 
my way of looking at things, it's a cleaner development, not as rushed like in 
Cabo, in that they ruin things and they don't plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The fishing here has always been excellent. La Paz is less known because we 
don't have that advertising budget behind us. (The Mexican Department of 
Tourism) never invested a nickel here. There are more interests there because 
of property holdings (by the government)." 
</P>
<P>
Coppola, whose family also owns the Finisterra Hotel in Cabo San Lucas, is 
saddened by the growth of that city but says fishermen who appreciate the charm 
and unspoiled beauty of a truly Mexican city need not worry about the lack of 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
He has eliminated the long boat ride it would normally take to reach the 
nutrient-rich waters off and south of Cerralvo Island with a 40-minute ride by 
van through the cactus-laden desert, across a jutting peninsula that protects 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The fleet of pangas sets on the beach immediately in front of Ensenada de los 
Muertos, the Bay of the Dead, named after a small cemetery lined by stones and 
marked by several graves of fishermen who lost their lives years ago. Once in 
the water, it becomes a bay full of life. Powerful roosterfish swim just off 
the beach for miles during the spring and early summer. Marlin and sailfish 
move into the waters offshore in summer and fall. An occasional wahoo cruises 
the deep-water channels and follows the warm-water currents in the winter, 
savagely attacking lures and trolled bonito on the surface in the summer and 
fall. The mighty pargo prowls the rocks and reefs year-round. 
</P>
<P>
And now, you even have Dosidicus-Gigas, or jumbo squid.

KING COACH COULD RETURN IN 3 WEEKS

<P>
King Coach Tom Webster underwent successful inner-ear surgery Tuesday at St. 
Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles and could be back with the team in less than 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James Sheehy discovered a leak of inner-ear fluid, an injury similar to one 
Webster suffered several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The new injury was caused when Webster, 40, fell while showering in his 
Edmonton hotel room Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was forced to resign as coach of the New York Rangers in January of 
1987 when the original inner-ear problem prevented him from flying. Surgery 
repaired that injury. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's condition was originally diagnosed as a concussion, but dizziness 
continued. Sheehy found the new injury in the same area as the old.

<P>
RULE PUT TOO MUCH STRAIN ON LEMIEUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After scoring at least one point in 46 straight games, five short of Wayne 
Gretzky's mark, the Pittsburgh Penguins' Mario Lemieux was forced off the ice 
after two periods against the New York Rangers last week because of the pain 
from a herniated disk in his back. 
</P>
<P>
It was all so pointless. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: In the NHL, a consecutive-game scoring streak ends automatically if a 
player doesn't play. Therefore, Lemieux, bothered throughout the streak by a 
back condition that continued to worsen, had to stay in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: What are we counting here, consecutive games scored in or consecutive 
games played in? One has nothing to do with the other. The object is to 
determine who is best at scoring every time he is on the ice, not who is best 
at getting on the ice to score. There's a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Joe DiMaggio is remembered for hitting in 56 consecutive games, Lou Gehrig for 
playing in 2,130 consecutive games. They are separate records. DiMaggio would 
not have been penalized for missing a game. Nor was Gehrig's mark broken by the 
failure to get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
By requiring Lemieux to play when he wasn't physically able, the NHL lost a 
chance for a memorable run at a hallowed mark. That would have meant a media 
blitz, not the worst thing for a league that finally made it back to network 
television last month for one afternoon after an absence of a decade. By 
penalizing Lemieux, the NHL hurt itself. 
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky set the record, he was playing with an injured shoulder. Had he 
been allowed to rest, his streak might have continued, creating an even more 
memorable mark to etch into the public consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
And maybe made more of the public conscious of the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Why not? 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Under NHL rules, the consecutive-game streak ends with the season. For 
example, Gretzky, then an Edmonton Oiler, actually scored in 60 consecutive 
games, since he had at least one point in each of the last nine games of the 
1982-83 season, before getting one in each of the first 51 games of 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion: Another dumb rule. When Orel Hershiser threw 59 consecutive scoreless 
innings at the end of the 1988 season, that wasn't the end of it. His streak 
continued into 1989. As it turned out, he was scored upon in the first inning 
of his first 1989 outing. But the opportunity was there. Along with a lot of 
good publicity. 
</P>
<P>
What if Lemieux had scored in the last 50 games of this season? Would he have 
lost his streak because of a bad break in the schedule? That's almost as unfair 
as losing because of a bad back. 
</P>
<P>
Rogie vs. Mario? The Pittsburgh Press recently researched that rarest of the 
rare in the NHL, the penalty shot. Checking all the way back to 1934, it was 
discovered that Lemieux has the best record on penalty shots, having gone five 
for five in his 5 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The best in defending against the penalty shot was Rogie Vachon. Now the 
general manager of the Kings, Vachon spent 16 seasons as a goalie, including 
seven with the Kings. In that span, he was six for six in stopping penalty 
shots.

FASHION: FOR A LONG TIME BILL WHITTEN DESIGNED IN OBSCURITY WHILE HIS ROCK 
MUSIC CREATIONS STOLE THE SPOTLIGHT, BUT NO MORE.

Talking about the Grammys disturbs Bill Whitten. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years he has designed more costumes for more Grammy winners than he 
can count. Michael Jackson's beaded, spangled stage clothes are Whitten 
creations. So are Lionel Richie's, Neil Diamond's and even some of Elton 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
But, there is no Grammy award for the category of costume design. So, at 
tonight's televised presentation, when more than 60 awards will be handed out 
-- some for categories as esoteric as album notes -- there won't be a Grammy 
for the designer who put Michael Jackson in a single rhinestone glove. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just as much a part of the music industry as Michael Jackson," Whitten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He was perched on a tall stool with his thin arms wrapped tightly around his 
chest. His matted tendrils of shoulder-length hair, brocade slippers and black 
tunic topped by a collar of black boa-feathers read like a rock fashion calling 
card. 
</P>
<P>
The feathered collar covered his chest and each time he rocked back and forth 
in frustration, as he did any time the conversation tended toward Grammys, one 
or two would drift to the floor, adding to the feathered nest that encircled 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten's name is rarely recognized outside the music business, yet his 
clothing designs are known the world over. With each moon-walking step and hand 
gesture, Michael Jackson displayed the Whitten style. The single glove and 
ankle-high black pants, and white socks with loafers were all designed for one 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very simple," Whitten calmly explained. "The audience was missing his 
hand and feet movements. They couldn't see the quick gestures he was making." 
</P>
<P>
Whitten dressed Elton John in extravagant capes and electric boots. He put 
Stevie Wonder in African print caftans and took Neil Diamond out of flower 
embroidered shirts and into bugle beads. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came into the business the only man in a beaded jacket was Liberace. 
Nobody had tasty beading for men. Nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Diamond was the first performer to find Whitten, back in 1974. Whitten had 
opened a custom shirt business called Workroom 27. The tiny shop was virtually 
invisible, located on the second floor of a building on Santa Monica Boulevard 
in West Hollywood. It was open for six months before the first customer walked 
through the door. Then Diamond showed up. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before Diamond became an advocate of Whitten's custom-designed 
clothes, and he spread the word. Doc Severinsen found his way to Workroom 27, 
and he brought the members of the band Chicago. Jim Brown came in and returned 
with Hugh Hefner. The domino effect took a year and a half to pay off. When it 
did, Whitten went from leasing one room to buying the entire building. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of his rock 'n' roll rag business he had a factory that employed 
50 people churning out the stage clothes for 20 groups -- the Commodores, the 
Jacksons, Edgar Winter and Steppenwolf among others -- as well as stars and 
regulars on the Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor television shows. 
</P>
<P>
"They (lead singers) didn't have one place they could go that could outfit them 
and the band. I was the one source for all that." 
</P>
<P>
Whitten's business crested as more and more bands demanded a personalized stage 
style. Then he became selective and scaled his client list to include only 
top-rung performers. Today he regularly suits up Michael Jackson, Lionel 
Richie, his old friend Neil Diamond and others such as magicians Siegfried and 
Roy. 
</P>
<P>
As he tried to down-scale his business, his popularity seemed to grow not only 
among performers but their wives and friends, and the fashion cognoscenti. Two 
of his most ardent clients are Brenda Richie, wife of Lionel, and Susan Fields, 
(of the Chicago retail empire, Marshall Fields). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he decided to give into the demand by opening a store on Melrose 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The store, called Bill Whitten, is scheduled to open March 4 and will carry 
everything from pajamas to evening wear for men and women. The broad range of 
apparel and accessories is priced at the high end of the spectrum. T-shirts 
start at $50 and some of the evening gowns top off at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes are not as outlandish as some of his stage costumes. The lines are 
clean and spare. They have to be, because the surface textures run riot. White 
silk suit jackets for men are beaded with bits of bone. Whitten sews metal 
sequins on 150-year-old, hand-loomed fabric from the Far East to make jackets. 
Evening dresses using a floral motif have beading that traces the print, adding 
three-dimensional pistils and stamens for the flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten's most inventive decorations appear on tuxedos. Scrolls of embroidery 
decorate the shoulders and pocket flaps, and peek around the vents of tuxedo 
jackets. Other black wool tux jackets sport large shawl collars of matte black 
suede or slick black leather. 
</P>
<P>
The clothes invite touching. From the sheer cotton voile pajamas and nubby 
chenille jackets to the fish skin boots that feel like leather, everything 
demands a tactile encounter, which is why the store is designed to look more 
like a gallery than a retail space. The expensive dresses will be kept in a 
glass vault. 
</P>
<P>
The prices shriek Rodeo Drive. The workmanship on the garments is akin to 
European couture. And the exquisite beading and embroideries seem incongruous 
on the street known for its funky, forward clothes. But Whitten says the drums 
of the underground beat louder in West Los Angeles than they do in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to create the underground trend first," he says. "Those are the people 
I need to reach." So he is starting on both coasts in the trendy pulse points, 
Melrose Avenue first and then, in early summer, in Manhattan's SoHo District. 
If other cities want a Bill Whitten store, he's only too happy to oblige. He 
intends to franchise them.

<P>
CONSUMERS: KNOWING THE FACTS ABOUT PREMARITAL AGREEMENTS CAN HELP COUPLES AVOID 
UNNECESSARY FRICTION.

<P>
For better, for worse. For richer, for poorer . . . 'til the prenuptial pact do 
us part. 
</P>
<P>
 That may well be the official marriage vow of the 1990s. Just ask Donald and 
Ivana Trump, who last week announced their plans to divorce -- and to duke it 
out over an amended prenuptial agreement that has him gloating and her 
steaming. 
</P>
<P>
The Trumps are not alone. Other notables who were at loggerheads over such 
agreements last year included: 
</P>
<P>
* Convicted hotelier Leona Helmsley, who at one point was accused of violating 
the terms of her prenuptial agreement by trying to gain control of her 
husband's estate. 
</P>
<P>
* Actor William Hurt, whose former live-in lover unsuccessfully alleged that 
they had entered into a prenuptial agreement. 
</P>
<P>
* And Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, who unsuccessfully contested 
his prenuptial agreement during divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
On a less controversial note, Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and Kimberly Conrad 
signed an agreement before they strutted down the aisle. And designer Mary 
McFadden, 51, married 22-year-old Kohle Yohannan sans a prenuptial agreement, 
although the couple reportedly vowed that a 20-pound weight gain would be 
grounds for divorce. Several months later, their marriage was over. 
</P>
<P>
Might a prenuptial agreement have affected McFadden's assets? Will Trump's 
protect his? 
</P>
<P>
The answers rest in the terminology of the agreement, the circumstances 
surrounding its signing and the laws of the particular state. As a general 
rule, a prenuptial (sometimes called "premarital" or "antenuptial") agreement 
is a binding contract unless the person contesting it can prove that it is 
legally defective. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, judges like to see people living with the consequences of their 
own decisions," said Commissioner Robert Schnider, who presides on the family 
law bench in Los Angeles County Superior Court and who teaches a course in 
family law and marital property at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "There is 
an ethos in our society that people ought to be responsible for themselves and 
their decisions. If a party had an agreement presented to him, it was up to him 
to say no and not sign it." 
</P>
<P>
Often, Schnider said, the decision to marry involves a weighing process. 
"Frequently, it's a woman without assets marrying a man with substantial 
assets. He's promising her a nice life if things work out. It's going to be a 
big change for her, a big step up. Now he's making demands on her to protect 
himself or to protect his children from a previous marriage. She has to decide: 
'Is it worth it taking a chance, going for this and giving up my rights, or 
should I just say no?' " 
</P>
<P>
A woman faced with that situation can turn it into a benefit, suggests Stuart 
Walzer, a partner with the family law firm of Walzer &amp; Gabrielson in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Walzer, recently deemed "one of the deans of family law" in California Lawyer 
magazine, said: "When a young woman in that situation comes to me and says, 'My 
fiance gave me this agreement and I want to sign it,' I say, 'No, you've got 
some bargaining power and you should use it.' The man wants her. She's never 
really going to be quite in the same position again." 
</P>
<P>
Schnider said court battles over prenuptial agreements are uncommon. In his 8 
1/2 years on the bench, he has presided at trials involving contested 
agreements "on the average, about one per year." 
</P>
<P>
The most common ground for contesting a prenuptial agreement is duress, said 
Schnider, who typifies it as: "Shortly before the wedding, your fiance puts a 
piece of paper in front of you and says, 'Sign this or I won't marry you.' It's 
the emotional pressure put on by having the invitations out, the gifts in, the 
guests coming, and having to embarrass yourself in front of all your friends by 
saying 'It didn't work out.' " 
</P>
<P>
But duress, like any legal concept, is open to interpretation. Daniel Jaffe, of 
the elite Beverly Hills family law firm Jaffe &amp; Clemens, settled this case 
last week: 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one years ago his wealthy client lived with a woman for five years. He 
insisted they would never marry and often pointed to a laminated check on the 
wall (his payment to a former wife), mounted above a sign bearing the word 
Think. When his live-in partner developed a serious illness, he offered to 
marry her -- as long as she signed a prenuptial agreement. She did so, against 
her attorney's advice. "Every time (guests visited), the man would wave the 
agreement around, saying, 'This is the best thing God and lawyers ever 
created,' " Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
Now entangled in a divorce, the wife claims the agreement is invalid because 
she signed it under duress. "If 'I won't marry you without a prenuptial 
agreement' is duress, then there are no (prenuptial) agreements that are any 
good," Jaffe said. But rather than run the risk of trial, the man gave his ex 
more money than the agreement provided. 
</P>
<P>
In the Trump case, there are similar concerns, Walzer said, adding that what 
Ivana Trump's lawyer is contending "is that Mr. Trump is so rich that he ought 
to give her more than what the agreement provides. But that would make all 
prenuptial or postnuptial agreements meaningless, absolutely meaningless." 
</P>
<P>
If couples won't honor prenuptial agreements, what's the point in having them? 
Said Schnider: "Probably 50% of these agreements aren't challenged. Of those 
that are challenged, 60% or more are upheld. So over three-quarters of them are 
doing the job they were supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
In prenuptial agreements he drafts, Jaffe often includes an incentive to abide 
by them: a clause stating that if a spouse contests the agreement and loses, he 
gets nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But it often doesn't get that far. Many people who consult lawyers about 
prenuptial agreements never end up going through with them. Schnider, who 
practiced family law for 11 years before becoming a judge, said he "spent more 
time talking about (prenuptial) agreements than drafting them." 
</P>
<P>
Why do people get cold feet about prenuptial agreements? "It's just not what 
people are thinking about when they're getting married," he said. "Even if a 
person has been married previously, he tends to be thinking, 'I made a big 
mistake before, but this time I've finally found the right person. I'm doing 
the right thing.' So if I'm getting an (prenuptial) agreement, does that mean 
I'm doing the wrong thing? Maybe I shouldn't be getting married." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over prenuptial agreements can raise havoc with partners' 
emotions. "Ice water on romance" -- that's how Walzer characterized the 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The document can, he added, chill a romance, because it sets a pattern for 
endless renegotiations. In a long agreement, such as a 55-page document he 
recently drafted, Walzer said, "it can get to the point where the couple is 
reading (the agreement) all night to determine whether they're going to go out 
to lunch together the next day. Marriage just isn't susceptible to a lot of 
lawyering -- it's too intimate a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
His son, Peter Walzer -- also a family law specialist with his own practice in 
Century City -- agreed. The younger Walzer, president of the Century City Bar 
Assn.'s family law section and treasurer of the Assn. of Certified Family Law 
Specialists, said such agreements can be "very difficult for newlyweds. . . . 
Basically one spouse is saying, 'Do you trust me?' and the other is saying, 
'No, I don't.' " 
</P>
<P>
Peter Walzer said he usually tries to arrange so couples marry without an 
agreement because "there always seems to be mistrust after that, and it's a 
difficult way to start a marriage." Were Walzer in that position, would he sign 
a prenuptial agreement? "No, I don't think I would." 
</P>
<P>
Although prenuptial agreements have long been a part of life for the rich and 
famous, Stuart Walzer said they are not always necessary, even in a 
community-property state like California. Through prudent financial planning, a 
person may be able to keep assets as separate property without a prenuptial 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, consider a man who inherited large family investments and 
lives off the passive income from them but does not manage them. "Even if the 
husband gets $1 million a year income from it, after a 10-year marriage the 
wife may have accumulated nothing because it is not community property," Walzer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, the wife would want a prenuptial agreement. "If she is 
marrying a very wealthy man, she may want to carve something out for herself. 
Her feeling may be, 'I'm putting aside opportunities for other marriages, 
opportunities to advance my own career. I should be compensated for that,' " 
Walzer said, adding, "You hear young women sometimes saying, 'I'd never have a 
prenuptial agreement; I'm so offended by the thought.' A mistake. 
</P>
<P>
"If she marries a high-roller, do-nothing kind of person who lives off his 
passive investments, she may end up with nothing except alimony at the end of a 
long marriage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Who else would benefit from a prenuptial agreement? An enormously successful 
business person like Donald Trump, who has acquired a "trophy wife" -- a 
beautiful, glamorous partner to enhance his public image -- would want an 
agreement "very badly," Walzer said. Because Donald Trump's efforts directly 
contribute to the increase in his business profits, under California law his 
wife could have a community property claim to part of those profits. 
</P>
<P>
What about the less-moneyed? "Most people should think long and hard before 
they decide to have a prenuptial agreement. In a first marriage, for a young 
couple just starting out together, it's insanity. They're going to try to build 
a life together based on mutual sharing and trust. They have to learn to deal 
with each other as best they can. If they can't make it, they can't make it," 
Walzer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in relationships where there is a substantial disparity of money and 
power, I still wonder whether it isn't an undue burden on the marriage" to have 
a premarital agreement, he said. "It's important to be very careful of whom you 
marry and get to know them as well as you can. But to say that the agreement is 
going to solve the kind of problems that arise after marriage, I just don't 
think so." 
</P>
<P>
Couples who negotiate a prenuptial agreement must realize they are "negotiating 
the divorce in advance of the marriage," Walzer said. "A lot of people don't 
want to face that." 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe likens a prenuptial agreement to a scalpel -- "in the hands of a skilled 
surgeon, it's a wonderful instrument. In the hands of a butcher, it can chop 
somebody up." 
</P>
<P>
An agreement that virtually shuts one spouse out, Jaffe said, always gives that 
partner the feeling he's not really part of a marriage. "Some wives have told 
me that their premarital agreement has been the bane of their existence every 
day of their marriage. Every day they hear 'This is my house, that is my 
painting on the wall.' " 
</P>
<P>
When the couple tires of living that way -- or when one spouse wants to change 
the rules -- the marriage ends, he said, "because that's who he bought -- he 
bought her, just like he bought the painting. And when she decides she wants to 
stand up and be a participant in the marriage, he says, 'You're changing our 
deal, this isn't what I bought. . . . I don't want to share and I'm not about 
to start now.' " 
</P>
<P>
And if the emotional costs aren't high enough, the financial considerations may 
make a couple pause at pursuing a premarital agreement. Legal fees for such 
agreements vary widely, depending upon their complexity and length and the 
lawyer's expertise. Highly experienced family law specialists, such as Jaffe, 
often charge a minimum of $7,500, even if evaluating an agreement drafted by 
the other spouse's counsel. General practitioners or younger lawyers may charge 
much less, often in the $2,000 range for a fairly simple agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Warren, an attorney with Cummins &amp; White in Los Angeles, drafts 
prenuptial and postnuptial agreements as part of her estate-planning practice. 
Her fee is lower than that of a family law specialist, depending largely on the 
extent of the property involved and how much research she has to do. "If you 
have a good accountant who can provide an up-to-date financial statement, then 
the lawyer's fee will be considerably less because some of the work has been 
done," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, she drafted what she terms a "fairly typical" 16-page prenuptial 
agreement. Another client brought in a one-page agreement for her to evaluate, 
but she said it is probably unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of paper to set forth each person's rights, what they're giving 
up, what property is involved," Warren said. "Without all that, the agreement 
isn't worth the paper it's written on."

BACK TO THE ORPHANAGE?; 
</P>
<P>
THE MERE MENTION OF THESE INSTITUTIONS CHILLS SOME, BUT OTHERS ASK: WHAT ARE 
THE OPTIONS? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a Covina neighborhood of tract homes and upscale ranch houses, 30 children 
are growing up together in an orphanage -- an institution that might seem to 
many as anachronistic in this modern suburb as a debtors' prison. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts might argue that the 91-year-old Masonic Home for Children 
actually is ahead of its time. 
</P>
<P>
It's a trailblazer of sorts because, as some child welfare workers have 
contended, it may be time to return to orphanages as a way of easing America's 
over-taxed foster care system. 
</P>
<P>
Orphanages, the institutions whose very name evokes Dickensian images of 
"cinder blocks and urinals," as one worker put it, suddenly have found 
themselves more widely touted as a possible future for foster care. 
</P>
<P>
And, as a result, those who staff the few remaining orphanage-type homes are 
finding themselves in demand as consultants. For example, John Rose, 
administrator of the Masonic Home for Children, said he has received numerous 
inquiries from groups and individuals nationwide interested in starting homes 
similar to his. Personnel from the Los Angeles County Department of Children's 
Services are conferring with directors of the Villages, a children's residence 
based in Topeka, Kan. Malcolm Smith, the Villages' education director, said his 
office has fielded more information requests than can be filled. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the recent attention to orphanages has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of proposals to revive the institutions dismiss them as a simplistic, 
quick-fix solution. One critic, calling the plan "bizarre," said orphanages 
historically "were not happy places. They did not prepare kids well." 
</P>
<P>
A resurrection of the institutions would only "further victimize the victims of 
this whole (foster care) mess," said Jerry G. Miller, director of the National 
Center on Institutions and Alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how well run an orphanage may be, "it isn't home and it isn't the 
real world," said Brian Cahill, president of Hathaway Children's Services, 
which runs a residential treatment center for abused and neglected children in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But those on both sides of the debate agree that something must be done soon 
about the increasing numbers of homeless and abandoned children. 
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the number of children in foster care nationally at 
340,000, although some experts say the number of children living out of the 
home is closer to twice that. By the mid-1990s, some experts predict 845,000 
children will require out-of-home care, said Brenda Nordlinger, executive 
director of the National Assn. of Homes for Children. 
</P>
<P>
This burgeoning population of neglected youth would no doubt come as a surprise 
to those who advocated shutting down orphanages in the 1940s and 1950s, when 
many social workers predicted there would be no more need for the institutions 
because young parents no longer were dying from wars and plagues, leaving 
children behind. 
</P>
<P>
But what those predictions failed to account for was the increase in "orphans 
of the living," as the new homeless youngsters sometimes are called. These new 
orphans come from families splintered by drugs, poverty, AIDS and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The recent push to reconsider orphanages as a solution to their plight has been 
inspired largely by two child welfare advocates: retired Philadelphia Judge 
Lois Forer and Joyce Ladner, a Howard University School of Social Work 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
Having observed abandoned youngsters' problems from different perspectives -- 
the juvenile justice and social welfare systems -- both women reached similar 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed that children who enter the system already traumatized by physical 
and sexual abuse, and other offenses, are only damaged further by failed 
attempts to reunite them with their families or by unsuccessful foster 
placements. In many cases, experts say, children have lived with -- and been 
rejected by -- 10, 15 or even 20 sets of parents. 
</P>
<P>
Forer wrote in Washington Monthly about a boy who bore more than 70 scars from 
beatings by his prize-fighter father but was returned to his home because child 
care agencies believe "the family should be kept together." 
</P>
<P>
Ladner, Forer and others say society should put less insistence on forcing 
children back into their own troubled families and into individual placements. 
Instead, public agencies ought to devote more effort to establishing group 
homes in the orphanage tradition. 
</P>
<P>
What the new orphans need, they contend, is some sense of permanence. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think foster care works very well with some children," Ladner said. 
"But our emphasis on trying to reunite the child with the parents is not always 
serving the best interests of the child. I guess what I'm trying to do is 
challenge the notion that we can provide every child with a lovely, wonderful 
set of foster parents." 
</P>
<P>
Ladner said she uses the loaded term orphanage "reluctantly." Indeed, so 
disturbing is that word to so many people that advocates already are proposing 
alternatives, such as "children's communities." 
</P>
<P>
But orphans themselves don't seem to object to the term. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Father Joseph Rivers -- founder and director of the Orphan Foundation 
of America and a man who grew up in foster homes and orphanages in New York 
State -- said "orphanages are what kids like us need." Shuttling children from 
foster family to foster family is "really a cruel system," he said, adding that 
after experiencing the turmoil of repeated placements, he found orphanage life 
a welcome sanctuary. "I loved it. I had a home." 
</P>
<P>
The new orphans, of course, often differ greatly from those of Rivers' day; 
many of today's abandoned youngsters have serious psychiatric and behavioral 
problems, requiring skilled intervention. It's common for such children to have 
had devastating experiences -- seeing a parent murdered or having themselves 
sold sexually to pay for a parent's fix of crack, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"These children are hurt, incapacitated, explosive and aggressive," said Dean 
S. Conklin Jr., executive director of the McKinley Home for Boys in San Dimas. 
"They don't like themselves, and they don't trust the world." 
</P>
<P>
No one also suggests these volatile youngsters be housed in facilities like the 
orphanages of old -- cavernous brick buildings where hundreds of pale children 
dined, mess-hall style, and slept in rows of steel bunks. The model agencies 
today are looking at is more like a prep school, where eight or 10 children 
live with house parents in a home-like setting. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, at the Masonic Home, which only accepts children with a familial 
link to the Masonic order, children are grouped in small, single-story homes, 
giving the place the feel of a community rather than of an institution, said 
home administrator Rose. The homes are scattered over 33 acres of lawns and 
citrus groves. Bordering one side of the facility is a "Huck Finn" type play 
area, as Rose described it, complete with a stream and hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
While siblings often are split up in foster placements, brothers and sisters 
here can live in the same house, depending on their ages. Children arrive as 
young as age 5 and may stay until age 18, "unless their family puts itself back 
together," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
One typical resident, Rose said, is a boy abandoned on his grandfather's 
doorstep at age 8. The child had been in 17 schools and homes in three years. 
He had been placed on psychotropic medication and had little self-esteem, an 
attitude reflected in his bent posture. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather, a former stone mason, could not care for the boy and delivered 
him to the Masonic Home, where he was taken off medication and was treated with 
a fairly traditional regimen of encouragement and attention. If the boy's 
emotional problems had required more specialized care, he would not have been 
accepted at the home, which is equipped to handle only "the good apples," Rose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, the boy, who now stands straight, is a star wrestler with a B+ 
average in his high school classes. 
</P>
<P>
A case such as this, in which a child goes permanently to a group home rather 
being treated and returned to the foster placement system, is rare these days, 
said Nordlinger, of the National Assn. of Homes for Children. 
</P>
<P>
Few long-term group homes exist. More common are facilities emphasizing short 
stays so as to comply with the Family Reunification Act, the federal law that 
requires agencies receiving federal money to strive to reunite children with 
their families or to put them in foster or adoptive families. 
</P>
<P>
"The focus of our entire child welfare system is to keep families together, if 
we possibly can," said Mary Hayes, director of specialized resources for the 
Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
While admirable in theory, some say the policy harms children who might benefit 
from a permanent placement. It also has made it impossible for orphanage-type 
facilities to operate without relying on private money. The Masonic Home, for 
instance, is funded by the Masonic fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that a natural or surrogate family is the best place to raise a 
child. "That's the grand plan and the major design," said Masonic Home director 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
But some children cannot safely be reunited with their parents; successful 
foster placements also have become more elusive as the population of homeless 
youngsters gets tougher and the demands on foster families greater. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding suitable foster families is a problem. Training and supervising them 
is a horrendous problem," said Conklin, who, in addition to being the executive 
director of the McKinley Home for Boys, is president of the California Assn. of 
Services for Children, whose nonprofit child-care agencies serve 30,000 
youngsters in the state -- or about half the state's total foster care 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Even given suitable foster families, matching them with a child can be 
difficult. Many children needing homes are older, and, thus, not so attractive 
to foster -- or adoptive -- families. And many orphaned youngsters have 
emotional problems or are of such an age that they won't bond with "a fake Mom 
and Dad," as one adoptee said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as difficult as it can be to find a family placement, "I think it's 
ultimately preferable" to a group placement, particularly with young children, 
said Bob McCallie, executive director of Sunny Hills Children's Services in San 
Anselmo. 
</P>
<P>
Another residential agency head, Cahill, of Hathaway Children's Services, 
agreed that a foster parent system could work only if it received more money 
and support. "I guess I'm not giving up" on the current system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Nan Dale, executive director of The Children's Village in Dobbs 
Ferry, N.Y., said the push to install every child in a family reflects a 
"romanticized view. We do need a middle ground (group placements) for a lot of 
kids," she said. "Kids really need to feel there's one place committed to their 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Societies have resorted to orphanages whenever a surplus of homeless youth 
began to "menace the gentry," says Eileen Simpson in her book, "Orphans, Real 
and Imaginary." 
</P>
<P>
Orphanages were popular in England during Dickens' time because hungry, 
half-tamed urchins threatened the well-fed citizens, she writes. Similarly, 
orphanages proliferated in America during the Civil War, when war orphans 
swarmed the countryside looking for food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
As inhumane as the early orphanages could be, their closings were premature, 
Simpson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who as a child lived with a surrogate family, said she preferred 
living in an institution because it offered one thing that foster families 
often do not: fairness. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what a child suffers from most is unfairness," she said. "In an 
institution, whatever attention there is is fairly well distributed." 
</P>
<P>
Given that endorsement for the orphanage system, Simpson said she is under no 
illusion that institutions can ever make up for what orphans have lost. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no substitute for a family," she said. "You just do the best you 
can."

GETTING IT IN BLACK AND WHITE UP FRONT

<P>
In the 1980s, heyday of prenuptial agreements, California passed a law to clear 
up consumer confusion. The Uniform Premarital Agreement Act covers the 
requirements and enforceability of prenuptial agreements signed on or after 
Jan. 1, 1986. Among its major provisions are: 
</P>
<P>
* Only people who are planning to marry -- not merely living together -- may 
enter premarital agreements. They take effect when the couple marry. 
</P>
<P>
* Both partners must sign a written agreement. They may revoke or amend it 
after they marry, as long as the changes are in writing and signed by both 
spouses. 
</P>
<P>
* The agreement may cover property rights of each spouse, as well as what will 
happen to their property if they separate, divorce or die. If they wish, the 
couple may define their personal rights and marital obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Prenuptial agreements meeting these legal requirements are binding contracts, 
as long as they were entered fairly and do not violate public policy. 
</P>
<P>
Either of these situations make an agreement unenforceable: 
</P>
<P>
* A person contesting the agreement did not enter it "voluntarily." A classic 
example of this is when one party signs an agreement shortly before the wedding 
at their partner's insistence. ("Sign this or I won't marry you!") Such 
pressured situations raise the legal issue of "duress." 
</P>
<P>
* The agreement was "unconscionable" when signed -- it was so one-sided that 
the disadvantaged spouse effectively had no meaningful choice; the terms were 
unreasonably favorable to the other spouse. ("I get everything; you get 
nothing.") Disadvantaged spouses also must prove that they: did not know their 
partners assets and debts; their partners did not fully disclose them, and that 
they voluntarily did not sign away their rights to the financial information. 
</P>
<P>
A prenuptial agreement that seems "too good to be true" for one spouse may turn 
out to be just that. "If someone came to me and said 'Draw up an agreement that 
says I get everything and my spouse gets nothing,' I would not be interested," 
said Stuart Walzer of Century City, a nationally known family law specialist. 
</P>
<P>
The best insurance for a valid premarital agreement is to negotiate fair, 
reasonable terms far in advance of the wedding, under unpressured 
circumstances. Family law specialists in Los Angeles offer these tips: 
</P>
<P>
* If your attorney drafted the agreement, be sure your spouse-to-be consults 
his or her own lawyer before signing it. "The presence of an independent lawyer 
tends to really make a big difference," said Los Angeles County Superior Court 
Commissioner Robert Schnider. 
</P>
<P>
* Allow your attorney to engage in negotiations as long as necessary with your 
fiance's attorney. Daniel Jaffe, a prominent Beverly Hills family law 
specialist, recently spent eight months negotiating a premarital agreement for 
a client whose annual income exceeds $10 million. The more extensive the 
negotiations, the more likely the agreement will be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
* Give full disclosure of your assets to your spouse-to be. Jaffe's standard 
agreement includes a complete financial statement, and a clause that the 
disclosure is being made for courtesy only -- not to induce the other party to 
sign. 
</P>
<P>
* Be sure the agreement is fair to your intended. "If the agreement provides 
that your spouse gets no property, the judge will probably see how unfair that 
is, even if he upholds the agreement," Jaffe said. "The judge may make up for 
that in nine different ways." * Do not misrepresent the legal effect of the 
agreement to your intended. A common claim Schnider hears in his courtroom is: 
"I didn't listen to my lawyer because my fiance said this was just a piece of 
paper and we'd rip it up in two years anyway, so I should just sign it." This 
may invalidate the agreement on grounds of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
* Conduct a proper signing ceremony, with witnesses, a notary, both attorneys 
and the couple present. Record it by audio and videotape, if possible. 
"Typically a party will contend, 'I didn't read the agreement, I didn't 
understand it, I was crying hysterically, I didn't want the agreement, the 
lawyer never told me I was waiving my rights,' " Jaffe said. "But the video may 
show a vastly different story." 
</P>
<P>
* Abide by the agreement's terms. "People get sloppy," Jaffe said. DARLENE

COURT AFFIRMS O.C. CASE ON POLICE POWER TO DEMAND ID 
</P>

A person stopped on the street by police, questioned and ordered to produce 
identification has not been seized but is merely engaged in a "consensual 
encounter," according to an Orange County ruling left standing Tuesday by the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The high court dismissed without comment or dissent an appeal of a ruling by 
the California Court of Appeal in Orange County upholding the October, 1986, 
arrest for alleged cocaine possession of Servando Lopez on a Santa Ana street. 
</P>
<P>
Many defense lawyers and even some judges contend that the Court of Appeal 
ruling, which has a binding effect throughout the state, illustrates a 
whittling away of the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and 
seizures in response to the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the end of the line for this one," said Orange County Public Defender 
Ronald E. Klar. "It is a difficult decision to swallow and kind of a scary 
prospect for some individuals." 
</P>
<P>
"It will allow police departments to go further in detaining people without 
calling it detention," said Klar, who defended Lopez. The attorney said the 
meaning of a "consensual encounter" is more confused now. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez -- who faces drug possession charges -- was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual twist, the Orange County appellate judge who wrote the opinion 
upholding Lopez's arrest said he disagreed with his own decision but felt 
compelled to rule as he did because of recent Supreme Court precedents. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Supreme Court said police can briefly question someone on the 
street if they have reason to believe that the person is engaged in wrongdoing. 
But, the court added, officers cannot detain or arrest the suspect without firm 
evidence, or probable cause, that he has committed a crime. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, several court rulings in drug and immigration cases have 
undercut the doctrine, suggesting instead that the police may stop, detain and 
question a person even if they have no evidence of illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 22, 1986, two Santa Ana officers on midday patrol spotted Lopez sitting 
on the hood of a car in a downtown area known for drug trafficking. Stopping 
their patrol car, they walked up to the man and began questioning him. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said he was waiting for a few friends to play pool. Dissatisfied with 
that and other answers to their questions, the officers asked to see his 
identification. When Lopez pulled out his wallet, the officers found a small 
amount of cocaine inside and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan threw out the evidence 
against Lopez, ruling that he had been unconstitutionally "seized" by officers 
who had no reason to believe that he had done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But last July, a three-judge appeals panel in Santa Ana overturned that ruling 
and reinstated charges against Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Their decision relied on Supreme Court rulings in 1983, 1984 and 1988 that said 
police or immigration officers can question a presumably innocent person as 
long as the person understands that he is "free to leave" at any time. These 
rulings "compel the conclusion that no seizure occurred here," Court of Appeal 
Associate Justice Thomas F. Crosby Jr. said in the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby conceded, however, that the trial judge had been correct from a 
practical standpoint, if not under the law. 
</P>
<P>
"In the real world, this defendant (Lopez) could not possibly have felt himself 
free to walk away when his identification was requested, and it is almost 
laughable to think the officers would have let him do so," Crosby wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he continued, "a solid majority of the U.S. Supreme Court is of 
the view that ordinary citizens and even undocumented aliens confronted by 
immigration officials would be aware that they could merely saunter off when 
asked to identify themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Klar appealed the Lopez decision to the California Supreme Court, which 
rejected it in August. In December, he filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Lopez vs. California, 89-959. 
</P>
<P>
"The message sent out by the California Court of Appeal," Klar said, "is that, 
without arousing any reasonable suspicion whatsoever, a law-abiding citizen may 
be approached by armed police officers in a public place, surrounded so that 
his path is obstructed, asked accusatory questions, continued to be questioned 
after he has chosen not to respond and requested (to) produce identification, 
all without the protection of the Fourth Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
"They say you don't have to talk to the officers, just walk away" Klar said. 
"Not very many people walk away when an officer is talking to them. You could 
be charged with running away."

The state Fair Political Practices Commission said Tuesday that it is reviewing 
a complaint by Democratic state Senate candidate Janice Graham alleging that 
Republicans meddled with her primary campaign earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Graham of Laguna Hills said a Republican political action committee in 
Sacramento was responsible for spending $17,000 to mail copies of a letter in 
support of her campaign for the special primary for the 31st State Senate 
District seat held Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Graham won the Democratic primary and will face Assemblyman Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier) in an April 10 runoff election. Hill narrowly defeated Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Political officials speculated that the letter was intended to strengthen 
Graham's campaign so that Democratic voters would not defect to Ron Isles, a 
pro-choice Republican who was appealing to Democrats for support. They also 
speculated privately that Hill was the intended benefactor of the letter. 
Hill's campaign has said it had no knowledge of the mailing. 
</P>
<P>
Officials for the Voter Information League, the source of the letter, could not 
be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The special primary was held to replace former state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights), who resigned in December. The district straddles the 
border between Los Angeles and Orange counties, stretching from Whittier and 
West Covina in the north to Laguna Beach in the south. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Nichioku, an FPPC spokeswoman in Sacramento, said that Graham's 
complaint had been received Tuesday and that there would be no comment until 
the panel examines the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said the letter may have helped her campaign, but she complained that it 
was unauthorized and contained inaccurate information that caused some 
recipients to complain to her office. 
</P>
<P>
She also said that some of the letters were delivered after the primary, 
"making her campaign look incompetent," and that the letter led some people to 
believe she had an alliance with Hill to defeat Isles. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank Hill is the last person that I want to be allied with," said a Graham 
statement, which added that Hill is a subject in the FBI's influence-peddling 
investigation at the Capitol.

HUGE LOTTO JACKPOT DRAWS THRONGS

Jack Kleimeyer didn't seem deterred by the 1-in-14-million odds against his 
winning today's expected $60-million Lotto jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
He bought one ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"I could win as easy with one as 100 (tickets)," the 56-year-old Irvine man 
said. "I'm confident." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that a number of players were confident their picks would win the 
jackpot, which officials say could be a record if ticket sales continue at 
Tuesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Meyers, 23, a clerk at Rolf's Wines &amp; Spirits in Irvine, said that by 2 
p.m. Tuesday, the store had sold 5,720 tickets, more than double the number 
sold the same day last week. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these people will tell you they're playing to support the schools," 
Meyers said. "I don't believe it. It's far from an altruistic society." 
</P>
<P>
At Rolf's, a counter is set aside to sell lottery tickets, and they sold fast 
Tuesday as customers bought five, 10 or 20 tickets at a time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing since the lottery started," said Robert Lambert, a 
maintenance technician at Pacific Bell. "I'm due, I'm due!" 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales for Sunday and Monday broke records, despite the holiday and 
storms that caused poor road conditions in parts of the state, said Joanne 
McNabb, a spokesman for the California Lottery. "There were a lot of sales 
early Sunday," she said. "We figured they were golfers." 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales Tuesday seemed destined for the record books as well. About 1 
million tickets were sold from 5 to 8 a.m. Tuesday, McNabb said. By 2 p.m., 8 
1/2 million tickets had been sold, well above the average Tuesday sales of 3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Lotto tickets are $1 each. The deadline for buying tickets is 7:45 tonight at 
businesses throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"When it gets big like this, it becomes a kind of social event," McNabb said. 
"Everyone's talking about it when you go out to dinner. . . . It's sort of like 
the Super Bowl and the Academy Awards." The previous biggest jackpot was $61.98 
million, drawn Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Webster, a systems analyst from El Toro, bought 10 tickets at 
Albertson's on Campus Drive in Irvine, even though she didn't think she'd win. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't buy . . . then for sure you won't win," she said. "Somebody's 
gotta win."DANICA KIRKA

CITY OKS REZONING OF WETLANDS SECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following a public outcry to restore a vast area of former and existing 
wetlands, the City Council on Tuesday agreed to change the zoning of a 142-acre 
region to restrict future development. 
</P>
<P>
The decision does not preclude any new development there but does place a 
roadblock in the path of property owners hoping to build in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The council's 5-1 decision, greeted by a standing ovation from the overflow 
crowd dominated by environmental activists, is the city's first step toward 
resolving a 10-year impasse over how the land should be used. 
</P>
<P>
The zone change formally designates as wetlands all but seven acres of the 
"white hole" area, so called because years of indecision over its specific use 
has left it a glaring white spot on city zoning maps. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists argued that the land, a wide strip of mostly privately owned 
properties along the Pacific Coast Highway from Beach Boulevard to the Santa 
Ana River mouth, must be preserved and restored because it is a crucial natural 
breeding ground for birds and other wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Huntington Beach Conservancy vowed to use recent publicity about 
the oil spill off the city's coast to pressure council members to restore the 
area to a teeming natural wildlife refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state Coastal Commission has designated the area as an 
environmentally sensitive region, the property owners have contended that they 
have a right to develop their land and argue that most of the wetlands are too 
damaged to be revived. 
</P>
<P>
The new zoning of the land, which retains existing zoning allowing limited 
development but adds a "coastal conservation" designation, has been promoted by 
city planners as an interim compromise in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was put forth as an interim remedy until property owners and 
environmental agencies can arrive at a a land-use settlement that is mutually 
amicable, such as the agreement finalized last year concerning the nearby Bolsa 
Chica Wetlands Reserve. The Pacific Coast Highway Coalition, a collection of 
environmentalists, property owners and government officials patterned after the 
coalition that resolved the Bolsa Chica dispute, was formed to address the 
"white hole" area controversy. 
</P>
<P>
A narrow, seven-acre swath of the land, most of which is currently used by a 
boating brokerage company, was exempted from the zoning change. Deemed by the 
Coastal Commission as too badly degraded to ever be restored as wetlands, the 
land instead is designated for certain types of commercial development with no 
conservation clause. 
</P>
<P>
About 83 acres owned by the Southern California Edison Co. was removed from the 
city's original plan to declare 232 acres as wetlands. The City Council decided 
that the Edison land, on which the company operates a power plant and oil 
storage facility, was developed too extensively to restore as wetlands.JOHN

COUNCIL OKS BAN ON NEWS RACK NUDITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has given final approval to an ordinance prohibiting the 
display of sexually explicit material in news racks throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, displaying such material is punishable by a fine of up 
to $500 or six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
However, the vendors can still sell the publications as long as nudity is not 
visible through the news rack window, City Atty. Andrew Arczynski said. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors protested the ordinance during interviews last week, but none attended 
Tuesday night's meeting where the City Council voted 5 to 0 to adopt the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of what they say, it comes down to First Amendment rights," Tony 
Kiss, publisher of Hollywood New Reality, said last week. "They are trying to 
stifle personal freedom. We have to fight back and stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was adopted at the request of parents whose children walk by news 
racks displaying explicit mater on the way to Walter Knott Elementary School. 
Parents wanted the racks removed altogether, but City Manager Kevin O'Rourke 
said any further restrictions will have to come from the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The state Senate is reviewing a bill that would make it a misdemeanor to 
display or sell sexually explicit material from a vending machine in a public 
place. The measure passed the Assembly on Jan. 29.LYNDA NATALI

$400,000 APPROVED FOR HOME PROGRAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The city has set aside $400,000 to help low- and moderate-income families buy 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an innovative program to help some folks get started," said Mayor Don L. 
Bone after the City Council voted Tuesday night to approve the First Time Home 
Buyers program. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which begins April 15, will benefit first-time home buyers and 
homeowners forced to move because of redevelopment projects, said May Hui, the 
city's director of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
The loans will be for a maximum of 15% of the purchase price of the home or 
$30,000, whichever is less. Borrowers will have 20 years to pay back the loan 
at an interest rate of 5%. 
</P>
<P>
About $100,000 of the $400,000 is earmarked for people affected by 
redevelopment projects. Hui said many people who have been forced to move 
because of redevelopment projects often cannot afford homes in other areas of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first to be eligible for the new program will be a group of 15 
homeowners who will be displaced by a redevelopment project. LYNDA NATALI

CITY BACKS OFF ON MOTOR HOME RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 375 recreational vehicle owners persuaded the City Council on Tuesday to 
continue to allow motor homes to be parked in street-side driveways of private 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The city's code enforcement officer had recommended an ordinance to require 
recreational vehicles to be parked on driveways at least 14 feet from the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
But after seeing the crowd that showed up, the council instead voted 
unanimously to form a commission of residents to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Senior code enforcement officer Karen Atkinson said 56 people complained about 
motor homes parked in their neighborhoods last year, and nine complained this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson said those who complained described the vehicles as eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
But recreational vehicle owners complained to the council that they have no 
other place to park. Renting space at an RV park costs about $90 a month, and 
all local parks have a two-year wait, said Barbara Reott, 60, who built a 
driveway at her home for parking her RV. 
</P>
<P>
The panel created by the council will study codes governing recreational 
vehicle parking to see whether modifications are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
At least half the panel members will be recreational vehicle owners. TOM

RACISM ADDRESSED BY STUDENT PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Dr. Jerry Wright, an anthropology professor at Cal State Fullerton, 
initiated a student panel discussion about racism on Tuesday, he said he was 
both pleased and saddened by his invitation to the event. 
</P>
<P>
As a college student at UC Berkeley during the 1960s, he said, he never thought 
that university campuses in the '90s would still be trying to improve race 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a sadness in doing this," he told the capacity crowd of about 60 
people in the university Women's Center. "We are about to enter the year 2000, 
and we still have racism -- and, of all places, on campus." 
</P>
<P>
The panel of four black students tackled seemingly age-old questions about 
racism and what could be done at the university level to help improve the 
situation, on campus and off. The hour-long discussion was one of a number of 
academic and social events at the university in observance of Black History 
Month. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the panelists Wednesday said they had experienced racism on and off 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
"There're a lot of myths out there about black people," said Margie Holland, a 
senior English major. 
</P>
<P>
Panelist Karen Henson, also a senior, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that it's really propagandized," she said, pointing to the 
number of black athletes portrayed in sports-gear advertisements. "It's just 
pushed and pushed and pushed." 
</P>
<P>
Panel members agreed that a solution to racism is education. 
</P>
<P>
Gregorio McDonald told the multi-ethnic crowd of mostly women that mandatory 
reading lists should be included in the university curriculum. Then, he said, 
bigots would "no longer be able to hide behind the shield of ignorance that 
keeps racism going." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the panelists are involved in a project with other students on campus 
to make ethnic studies courses mandatory for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Some audience members raised the issue of "reverse" discrimination. And the 
panel members agreed that people of all ethnicities needed to work together to 
help improve race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Nguyen, a junior computer science major who attended the discussion, said 
that as an Asian-American student who has been faced with racist attitudes, he 
was interested in understanding how black students handled the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to see how they related," Nguyen said. "I realized a lot of 
white people here have a supportive mind. They encourage minorities to stand up 
for themselves." LISA MASCARO

RALLY MARKS THE RELEASE OF MANDELA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As students and faculty members walked across campus at noon, the subtle sounds 
of drums beating and voices singing could be heard in the background. It was a 
tape recording of South African music which marked the beginning of a rally by 
UC Irvine students to celebrate the release of Nelson R. Mandela in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"On Feb. 11, 1990, the (prison) gates opened and there emerged a man, Nelson 
Mandela," said the rally's organizer, Harry Mashele, a physics major from the 
black township of Soweto. "He is an embodiment of hope. He stands for 
everything I believe in. It's indescribable." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 students, faculty and administration officials gathered in front of 
the administration building Tuesday to hear speakers and sing a song considered 
the black South African national anthem. After the students passed out flyers 
with the words to the anthem, many others held their fists in the air while 
they sang. Sitting on the steps before two flag poles, some of the students 
brought their lunches and many skipped class. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Mashele, they chanted "Amandla," a Zulu word which means "power to the 
people." As he yelled out other African words, the crowd responded with cheers 
and the word amandla. 
</P>
<P>
During the rally, students bought T-shirts that read, "Welcome home comrade 
Mandela" and signed freedom scrolls that will be sent to Mandela in South 
Africa next month. 
</P>
<P>
Among the speakers were campus faculty members, administrators, and Irvine's 
Mayor Larry Agran. 
</P>
<P>
Mashele told the crowd, "Apartheid is not limited to the doors of South Africa. 
As long as it remains in South Africa, no African country can totally be free. 
I still cannot vote in my own country. I do not think it is such an awful sin 
to be black in my own country. It pains me so much to see where we are." 
</P>
<P>
Mashele asked the students to support Mandela's cause and to help end 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa, you shall overcome," Mashele said to an cheering crowd. "We are 
unstoppable. We will give it whatever it takes to liberalize South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the rally was Aliko Songolo, associate professor of French at 
UCI. He is from Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt excited, elated and the sense of joy (at Mandela's release). Especially 
seeing him with his head held high and walking tall," Songolo said. 
</P>
<P>
Songolo proposed that the university set a special day honoring Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"Feb. 11 is a significant date. It's historic and it happened during Black 
History Month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lynnette Darrell, a UCI senior, said, "We're here to show our support. We're 
glad he's finally been released." 
</P>
<P>
Standing with her was junior Arnetta White, who said, "We also don't want the 
world to think that everything is all right in South Africa since he has been 
released." 
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors of the rally were the Campus Coalition for Human Rights, the 
African-American Students Union, Amnesty International, Alpha Phi Alpha 
Fraternity and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Parham, director of the campus Career Planning and Placement Center, 
said, "My sense of jubilation is contrasted by feelings of disappointment. You 
can take pride of his release but not enough has been changed in South 
Africa."LUZ VILLARREAL

purchase.

<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who heads the OCTD board, voted against the 
purchase after suggesting that the current fleet is not running at capacity. He 
noted that he sees buses on the street occasionally that are "far less than 
filled." 
</P>
<P>
"Are we increasing capacity far more than we need to?" Stanton asked. 
</P>
<P>
John Erskine, a Huntington Beach councilman, also voted against the proposal, 
saying that the district should not purchase more petroleum-fueled vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
In building their case for the new buses, OCTD officials pointed to a 33% 
increase in ridership during the past two years and a rise of more than 50% in 
passenger complaints, mostly about service delays. 
</P>
<P>
They also said the district must make the purchase this year because federal 
air-pollution regulations that take affect Jan. 1, 1991, will require use of 
engines that are not commercially available. 
</P>
<P>
The new anti-smog regulations will be enforced by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. The South Coast Air Quality Management District is 
considering similar rules. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would require that bus emissions be reduced to levels currently 
obtained with experimental, methanol-fueled buses, which produce 90% less soot 
or particulate matter, and about half the nitrous oxides of a regular bus, 
according to AQMD spokesman Tom Eichhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said he was opposed to increasing the district's reliance on petroleum 
and recommended that the district use its smaller, propane-powered Dial-A-Ride 
vans as much as possible until new engines that run on alternate fuels become 
available in the "next year to two years." 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we're caught between a rock and hard spot," OCTD General Manager James 
P. Reichert said after the board meeting. "We would love to have zero-polluting 
buses, and there is much progress being made, but the engines we need (to meet 
new emission standards) are simply not being manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
"At the same time," Reichert added, "we're getting tremendous pressure to put 
additional service out there." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's vote authorized the expenditure of $9.6 million to buy the 40 buses, 
purchase two experimental "superbuses" that have been provided for the past two 
years by a private contractor, and refurbish 27 buses.

OFFICIAL SAYS LEAST SAFE THING ABOUT MALATHION IS THE COPTER SPRAYING IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
State Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer, trying to quiet fears in Southern 
California neighborhoods sprayed with malathion, said Tuesday that the risk of 
a helicopter crash is greater than any hazard from the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said studies have shown repeatedly that the chemical being sprayed from 
the air to halt a Mediterranean fruit fly infestation does not pose a human 
health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not viewed as having significant untoward health effects at the dose 
that is being used currently," Kizer said. "The greatest acute health hazard 
that might be related to the spraying program is the risk of a helicopter crash 
that might occur -- and not the chemical that is being used." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate effort to allay public concerns, Food and Agriculture Director 
Henry Voss promised to release the names of 16 heretofore-secret ingredients 
that make up 5% of the malathion potion used by the state. By late afternoon, 
however, the list had not been made public. These chemicals are in addition to 
the corn syrup bait used in the spraying program to attract the insects and had 
not been previously disclosed because they are trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
The comments from Voss and Kizer came at an unusual forum called to answer 
questions from legislators whose constituents have grown increasingly upset 
over the aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz, whose home in Sylmar was sprayed Monday 
night, protested that residents are not given adequate notice of the spraying 
schedule and that a hot line to keep residents informed is usually busy. 
</P>
<P>
And Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) questioned whether aerial 
spraying is needed in his district and whether the state could instead use 
sterile fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the Department of Food and Agriculture, 
said the department would prefer using sterile fruit flies after the first 
bombardment with malathion. But the Southern California infestation has become 
so large that the state cannot produce enough sterile insects for the entire 
area. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, he said, a laboratory in Hawaii is producing 100 million sterile 
fruit flies each week that are being released in parts of Los Angeles and at a 
separate infestation in Santa Cruz County. Shipments of up to 40 million more 
insects have arrived from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But until another lab is completed in Hawaii this spring, there will not be 
enough flies for all of the infested regions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a later interview, Siddiqui said a 36-mile spray area around Garden Grove 
and Westminster in Orange County would be "an excellent candidate" for 
replacing spraying with sterile Medflies once the new flies are ready. Just two 
fertile flies have been found in that area -- and none in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said he expects that the state can double its supply of sterile flies 
by "early May" and then quickly eliminate spraying for certain areas. Officials 
had previously said they planned to spray all the current Southland zones up to 
a dozen times, probably through June or July. 
</P>
<P>
Kizer said: "Public anxiety . . . is being fueled by some inaccurate reports 
that sometimes border on being inflammatory in the public media. It is not 
viewed as a carcinogen or a teratogen -- something that causes birth defects. 
The issue has been looked at and relooked at and relooked at. My staff feel 
very comfortable with regard to the safety of the product."

TENNESSEE, COLORADO TO MEET IN ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: MATCHUP FOR THE FIRST DISNEYLAND PIGSKIN GAME AUG. 26 WILL BE 
OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED TODAY.

<P>
Colorado and Tennessee will meet in the inaugural Disneyland Pigskin Classic on 
Aug. 26 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sources from both schools and the Orange County Sports Assn. confirmed the 
matchup, which will be announced at a press conference at 10:30 a.m. today at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches from both schools are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Each team is guaranteed $550,000 and 25% of the profits after expenses. 
Although a television contract has not been signed, Orange County Sports Assn. 
officials have been negotiating with Raycom. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee and Colorado were chosen from a list of six teams from last year's 
Associated Press final top 10 rankings; Florida State, Michigan, Alabama and 
Illinois also were on the list. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado (11-1) was ranked No. 4 in the nation and Tennessee (11-1) was fifth. 
Colorado lost to Notre Dame, 21-6, in the Orange Bowl. Tennessee beat Arkansas, 
31-27, in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado and Tennessee will meet for the first time, but the Buffaloes are no 
strangers to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes are 0-2 in Freedom Bowls, losing to Washington, 20-17, in 1985 
and to Brigham Young, 20-17, in 1988. Colorado will be playing a Southeastern 
Conference school for the first time since 1980, when the Buffaloes lost, 
23-20, at Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee game will be the first of five tough nonconference games in a 
schedule that also includes against Texas, Illinois, Washington and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes feature several players from the Los Angeles area, including 
quarterback Darian Hagan (Locke High School) and halfback Eric Bieniemy (Bishop 
Amat). They also signed Los Alamitos running back Erik Mitchell to a letter of 
intent last week.

MIKE PENNER: DARK CLOUDS TRAIL TITANS, OBSCURING SUNNY START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the sun has deemed UC Irvine worthy again of its glow, the Big West 
storm front has moved north to Cal State Fullerton, to the land of Cedric 
Ceballos, lofty preseason predictions, early NCAA aspirations . . . and, 
presently, a 12-13 won-lost record. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, owners of a 5-0 record on Dec. 16, now own an 0-5 record since Feb. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, handicapped as high as second in the November Big West forecasts, 
now are handicapped with a 6-10 conference record and consigned to seventh 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans, with four starters back from last season's 16-13 team, now need an 
improbable sweep of Irvine and Nevada-Las Vegas in their last two games to 
avoid taking a losing record into the conference's all-comers tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the stench of disappointment at Fullerton, Coach John Sneed points to his 
public preseason warning, by which he claimed it would be "unrealistic" to 
expect the Titans to repeat their luck-laden performance of 1988-89. That 
Fullerton team was the surprise of the Big West, a collection of unknowns and 
never-weres that ambushed out of the bushes and forced six overtime games, 
winning five of them. 
</P>
<P>
Those Titans had Fate playing sixth man, so maybe Sneed had a point. Maybe last 
season was the best-case scenario played out to its fullest and any 1989-90 
encore was doomed before the first tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this team sports all the classic signs of underachievement and the 
frustration that results from dashed high hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Starr, a first-year assistant coach, resigns. 
</P>
<P>
John Sykes, last year's starting center, is kicked off the team. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Jones, the departed '89 power forward who averaged 11.5 points and 6.9 
rebounds, becomes canonized as The Missing Link, the oh-so-suddenly 
irreplaceable part. 
</P>
<P>
And Sneed, according to courtside accounts, has become increasingly testy, 
venting his spleen with everyone from the Titan Gym timekeeper to the public 
address announcer to the team's radio broadcaster. 
</P>
<P>
It is not a happy time to be a Titan. With the exception of Ceballos, the 
all-conference forward headed for bigger things in the NBA, no one in 
orange-and-blue has performed to expectations, unrealistic or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill, the No. 2 scorer in the Big West as junior, has seen his average 
slip from 19.3 points a game to 18.8 and his shooting percentage drop from .448 
to .404. In two losses to UC Santa Barbara, Hill went a combined 2-for-26 from 
the field. Monday night against Cal State Long Beach, Hill had 18 points in the 
first half, scored the first basket of the second half . . . and didn't make 
another field goal the rest of the way, including the five-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Williams, the sophomore point guard, continues to rank as the Titans' 
Buzzer Beater, the nickname bestowed upon him last season by Hill. In his 
two-year Fullerton career, Williams has beaten six buzzers -- first half or 
second half -- with baskets. Too bad the buzzer sounds only twice a game. The 
rest of the time, Williams is a 34% shooter, with better success outside the 
three-point line (40%) than inside it (29%). 
</P>
<P>
Opposite Ceballos, who's averaging 22.4 points and 12.2 rebounds, the other 
forward position has been shared by Agee Ward and Van Anderson. Combined, 
they're averaging less than 10 points a game. And the center, David Moody, is a 
fifth-year senior getting his chance in the wake of Sykes' spin-out, averaging 
4.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that's twice as high as the 2.1 average left behind by Sykes, who 
could be counted on for his one dunk a game, if nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the whole Sykes saga summarizes the Titans' fall this winter. Last 
season, for reasons yet unexplained, Sykes, a player of ordinary skills, went 
psycho -- hence the nickname -- and became a ball of terror down the stretch. 
He tore down rebounds, he hustled on defense, he dove for loose balls and he 
became an inspirational force as Fullerton won eight of its last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Sykes was only half there. First he was sidelined by a mysterious 
and reoccuring eye infection that ultimately turned out to be the result of 
poorly cleaned contact lenses. Then he contracted strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
In and out of the lineup, Sykes traipsed in and out of Sneed's doghouse before 
the coach finally cut him last week for missing study hall and team meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The early indicators for a successful Titan run in 1990 may well have been 
fool's gold. Half of last season's 16 victories were decided by three points or 
less. Five were won in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
With just two more bad bounces, that 16-13 record could have been 14-15, right 
on track with the current 12-13 pace. 
</P>
<P>
And that 5-0 start? Consider the opposition: 
</P>
<P>
Lamar, now the last-place team in the America South Conference at 6-19. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas State, a Division II school. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's, a 6-18 team that was forced to play without Coach Paul Landreaux 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa, the fourth-place team in the Missouri Valley Conference. 
</P>
<P>
And Cal State Northridge, another Division II school. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Fullerton met up with taller competition -- Colorado State, UCLA, 
Las Vegas -- those credentials were rudely placed in their proper corner. 
</P>
<P>
So, was Sneed right and all the evil, know-nothing, ill-intentioned experts 
wrong last November? Are the Titans merely playing to form, now that the cloud 
cover's been lifted? 
</P>
<P>
Well, here are some more questions to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
Don't good young teams generally get better? 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't Fullerton beat undermanned opponents such as San Jose State, Fresno 
State and the University of the Pacific? 
</P>
<P>
How do the Titans miss six free throws in the last 2:20 and blow an 11-point 
lead at home against Santa Barbara? 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't Hill have hit that wide-open three-pointer at the buzzer Saturday 
against New Mexico State? 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't Anderson have hit that 12-foot bank shot on the last play of overtime 
against Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't these Titans have a winning record? 
</P>
<P>
At Fullerton, you don't need a weatherman to tell you which way the wind's 
blowing.

In another 3-A game: 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame 76, Rancho Alamitos 71 -- Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High 
is going to the 3-A basketball semifinals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, we didn't think they were going to give up," Coach Mick 
Cady said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had won 20 games . . . but we're still not satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (15-10) took a 27-17 first-quarter lead and was in control for much 
of the game. But with 2:32 left, Rancho Alamitos completed a 10-3 run and 
trimmed the Vaqueros' lead to 63-59. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos forward Tony Cortez, the game's leading scorer with 23 points, 
fouled out less than a minute later, and that ended the Rancho Alamitos threat. 
</P>
<P>
"(Notre Dame was) a good team," said Rancho Alamitos Coach Eric Hamamoto, whose 
team finished with a 21-4 record. "They're taller, quicker and faster. But like 
I told my kids, I'd take our group over their group any time. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are winners -- they're champions," he said. "We had kids that 
started the game on the bench out there (in the fourth quarter) and it was 
their guts. They never gave up." HEATHER SMALLEY

LAGUNA BEACH SHAKES OFF BISHOP, 73-62 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Leading by two points with about four minutes remaining, Laguna Beach High 
School was finally able to shake a quick and determined Bishop team Tuesday 
night, taking a 73-62 victory in the Southern Section 2-A playoffs at San 
Clemente High school. 
</P>
<P>
Guard John Trevino began the 15-6 closing run with a 10-foot shot with 3 
minutes 22 seconds remaining, then made another 10-footer in the key to give 
the Artists (21-5) a 62-56 lead. Josh Borella, who had a game-high 28 points, 
made three of four free throws and Trevino drove the lane, took a pass from 
Brady Butcher and scored to give Laguna Beach a 67-57 lead with 1:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:32 remaining, Dain Blanton took a lob pass and scored on a layup to give 
the Artists a 12-point lead and put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"Josh did a good job helping to break the press," Laguna Beach Coach Ed Bowen 
said. "We can break a press easily. And Trevino went in there and got some 
points when we needed them in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"It took us longer to win tonight then I thought it would. They (Bishop) play 
tough -- they're good athletes. And after a trip like that, that must be hard." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, which traveled more than 300 miles, led, 18-14, after the first 
quarter. But Laguna Beach came back and took a 23-22 lead with 4:41 left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
A spurt late in the second quarter, led by Borella's nine points, gave Laguna 
Beach a 36-29 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop (15-10) fought back to go ahead, 51-49, early in the fourth quarter, but 
a 15-footer by Blanton with 5:54 left gave the Artists the lead for good, 
53-51. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A: 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo 80, Orange Lutheran 63 -- Despite shooting 51% (23-45) from the 
field, Orange Lutheran fell at West Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (15-13), which made 30 of 53 field goals for 57%, was led by Scott 
Panfil's 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Luke Aucoin's three-pointer on the opening possession of the 
second quarter gave the Lancers (16-11) a 19-18 lead. But Panfil scored the 
game's next six points on consecutive three-point baskets, and El Segundo led 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
With 12 first-half points on six-of seven shooting, junior center Brian Bedord 
kept the Lancers close and they trailed 35-31 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
But Panfil scored 15 third-quarter points, mostly on mid-range jump shots, to 
give El Segundo a 58-48 entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them have their shots in the second half," said Bedord, who finished 
with 21 points. "It was just bad defense." DAVID RAATZ

EL TORO FINDS IT'S HOT OUTSIDE, 85-76

Cajon High School Coach Mark Lehman was well aware of El Toro's outside 
shooting before their Southern Section 5-A quarterfinal playoff game Tuesday 
night. But when El Toro struggled from the perimeter in the first half, Lehman 
felt fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
His feeling didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
Sparked by the outside shooting of guards Kevin Martin and Rob Johnson, El Toro 
held off Cajon, 85-76, at Laguna Hills High School. The Chargers (22-5) will 
meet Mater Dei in the semifinals Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the win wasn't lost on El Toro Coach Tim Travers, who 
walked calmly into his team's locker room before shouting, "Final Four, baby." 
Travers said Friday night's game will mark the first time El Toro has reached 
the playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"The mood of this team is the best it has been all year," Travers said. "I 
think we're playing real good basketball. We saved our best for last." 
</P>
<P>
Just as El Toro, shooting about 39% of from three-point range during the 
season, saved its best outside shooting for the second half. The Chargers made 
only two of eight three-pointers in the first half, but thanks to a strong 
inside game, they led, 36-34, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, El Toro was 15 of 26 from the field, including six of 11 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"Outside shooters are usually streaky and they got a streak going," Lehman 
said. "They weren't hitting those shots in the first half. We had a guy right 
on them. We couldn't have played any better defense." 
</P>
<P>
Despite foul trouble in the first half -- three starters had three fouls by 
halftime -- Cajon rallied from deficits of 11 points in the second half and 10 
points in the third quarter to keep the game close. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Cajon guard Amar Washington, who scored a game-high 29 
points, tied the game, 66-66, with about five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
But three-pointers by Johnson, who scored 27 points, and Martin gave El Toro a 
72-70 lead. Another basket by Johnson pushed the lead to four points and Cajon 
(23-4) came no closer the rest of the way. The Chargers clinched the win by 
making nine of their last 10 free throws in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they could defend us," Travers said. "It wasn't a defensive 
struggle, but we played better defense than they did." 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us a lot of gaps inside and we tried to take advantage of those," 
said El Toro forward Greg Everett, who finished with 15 points. "And our 
outside shooting came through." 
</P>
<P>
Such shooting will be needed against Mater Dei (28-1). Everett said he knows 
what to expect from the Monarchs, who finished the regular season as the 
county's top-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just tough everywhere," he said.

Verbum Dei High School spoiled Santa Margarita's upset bid with a full-court 
press in the second half in a 56-52 victory in the quarterfinals of the 2-AA 
playoffs Tuesday night at Christ College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita, playing with no seniors against a team with a strong playoff 
record, led, 31-22, early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Verbum Dei's press sparked a 19-2 run to take a 41-33 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita cut its deficit to 41-39 on Hayes Ferry's two free throws with 
4:09 remaining in the fourth quarter, but Verbum Dei, led by Mark Mitchell, 
pushed the lead to 53-42 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Carpenter's three-point basket and Jeff Layne's inside scoring helped 
Santa Margarita close the gap to 56-52 in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita (14-13) was led by Layne's 15 points and five rebounds. Dan 
Bathey and Carpenter added 13 and 12 points, respectively. Mitchell and Zellie 
Hudson led Verbum Dei (13-12) with 20 and 15 points, respectively. TOM

<P>
Tehachapi 72, Whittier Christian 63 -- Brian McHome made six free throws down 
the stretch as Tehachapi (20-3) held off Whittier Christian at Brea-Olinda High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Oronoz scored 18 and Joe Konstantarakis 14 for Whittier Christian.

St. Margaret's 61, Pilgrim 60 -- Dann Campaigne made a 15-foot jump shot with 
three seconds left to give St. Margaret's the win at St. Margaret's. 
</P>
<P>
St. Margaret's led by as 10 points, but Pilgrim rallied and a jump shot by 
Parker Jenkins with 17 seconds left gave the Patriots a 60-59 lead. St. 
Margaret's set a play up for Ryan Westendorf, a 6-foot-7 center who was 
triple-teamed. Westendorf passed to Campaigne, who made an off-balance shot. 
Westendorf finished with 29 points and 25 rebounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard to miss El Toro High School's Ian Doleman when he's on the soccer 
field. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is his uniform, obscured by dirt and grass stains. 
</P>
<P>
Second, there is his voice -- it may be the only thing louder than the soccer 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday, Doleman made his mark with two goals, leading El Toro to a 2-1 
victory over visiting Santa Ana in a second-round Southern Section 3-A boys' 
soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
Doleman gave El Toro (12-3-2) a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the game when he took 
a cross-pass from Grant Schick and popped the ball under goalie Hector Ramos' 
left hand. 
</P>
<P>
Doleman was on the left side of the goal, just inside the box, and caught the 
Santa Ana defense out of position. 
</P>
<P>
Doleman put El Toro ahead, 2-0, eight minutes in the second half. Ali Akjol had 
broken away to the right of the goal and his initial shot bounced back to him 
off the left post. His second shot was deflected by Ramos in front of the goal 
where Doleman was waiting to score his uncontested shot. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana (15-4-6) scored when Robert Sanchez converted a direct free-kick 16 
minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro advances to the quarterfinal where it will play Dominguez, a 2-1 winner 
over Santa Barbara. But the Chargers will be be without Schick, who received a 
red card from the referee for an aggressive shot in the second half. ARA

SECOND-GUESSING WILL BE OVER AFTER EL TORO, OCEAN VIEW MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The long-awaited game between Orange County's second- and third-best girls' 
basketball teams is finally here. The question is: Who's No. 2 and who's No. 3? 
</P>
<P>
El Toro and Ocean View, which meet at 7:30 tonight in the 5-A quarterfinals, 
are a step behind Brea-Olinda for top-team honors in the county. Brea-Olinda, 
which defeated El Toro convincingly in the Irvine tournament final, didn't play 
Ocean View this season. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro was second in the county poll most of the season, except in the second 
week when the Chargers were upset by Capistrano Valley and Ocean View moved to 
No. 2. Fountain Valley upset the Seahawks in overtime the next week, however, 
and Ocean View dropped back to third. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (25-2), which starts five seniors, has balanced scoring, height, 
outside shooting -- and Jennifer Sullivan (6-2, 185), last year's Sunset League 
most valuable player. She averages 17 points and 14.6 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a stronger inside game than El Toro does, but El Toro always 
plays tough," Seahawk Coach Ollie Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Karie Yoshioka (16 points) runs the point for El Toro (24-5). She 
was the county leader in assists with an average of eight a game. Yoshioka and 
teammate Tracy Heiser can shoot from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
In other 5-A games: 
</P>
<P>
Orange (18-6) at Buena (24-0) -- Buena, the top-seeded team advanced to the 
semifinals last season. Coach Joe Vaughan's team has posted lopsided 
regular-season victories over such solid teams as Hart, third-seeded in the 
5-A, Ventura, a 4-AA quarterfinalist, and Santa Barbara (22-5). The Bulldogs, 
led by Mia Palkie, a 5-8 guard/forward who averages 10.4 points, and 5-11 
center Nicole Ellis (13.3 points), thumped second-round opponent, Pasadena, 
72-37, after a first-round bye. The unranked Panthers are coming off their 
biggest victory of the season, a 59-56 overtime upset of Esperanza, which was 
ranked seventh in the final 5-A poll. Three scorers lead the Panthers: 5-10 
center Nicole Champion (19 points), 5-8 forward Alin Perez (11.4) and Ginnie 
Hall (10.3). 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (18-9) at Hart (22-4) -- Even though third-seeded Hart did 
not defeat any of its tougher opponents -- Buena, Ocean View and Lakewood -- 
Coach Dave Munroe's Indians are heavily favored, because they are the defending 
division champions and are tough to beat at home. Hart is led by 5-8 sophomore 
point guard Anjanette Dionne (20 points, 4.5 assists), who started on last 
year's championship team. Sara Wilson, a 6-3 All-American senior, is quick in 
the post where she averages 17.9 points and 10.4 rebounds a game. The key for 
Capistrano Valley will be perimeter shooting and the fast break. Sophomore 
Alisa Farr (18.8 points, 9.2 rebounds) runs the point. Teresa Doesburg, a 5-5 
perimeter player, averages 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Edison (18-8) at Ventura (17-9) -- Edison starter Laura Vinch, a 5-7 forward 
who is tough on the boards, has seen limited action since she sliced a finger 
in a restaurant accident. She probably will return to the starting lineup for 
this game, giving the Chargers a boost. Eleven of Edison's 17 victories have 
come on the road. Edison is led by point guard and three-point shooting 
standout Debbie Fischer, the team's only senior. Fischer, the 5-6 captain, 
averages 21 points and 4.9 assists. She is reportedly the Southern Section's 
record-holder for most three-point baskets in a game (10 twice), single season 
(100) and career (110). The team holds the section record for most three-point 
baskets in a season at 109. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (20-8) at Loara (15-10) -- Two of the county's top centers -- 
Mission Viejo senior Jennifer Rohrig (6-3), an all-Southern Section selection 
last year, and Loara junior Traci Titus (6-2) -- meet in this game. Titus is 
quicker, but Rohrig is better-schooled in post moves. The teams have met twice 
this season. with Mission Viejo winning both games. Loara, in its 12th season 
under Coach Gary Blate, is coming off a 74-55 upset of second-seeded 
Woodbridge. The Saxons get the homecourt advantage which could swing things in 
their favor. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A: 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery (16-9) at La Habra (20-3) -- La Habra will tower over Bishop 
Montgomery. La Habra starts the Kristich sisters, 6-5 sophomore Zrinka and 6-1 
junior Ana, along with 6-0 junior Leslie Ferguson. Ferguson (16 points, 11 
rebounds) is the leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Lily Cabaleiro, a threat from three-point range, leads Bishop 
Montgomery with an average of 16.4 points a game. At 6-0, Keisa Smith is the 
tallest player coming off the bench. The tallest starter is 5-10 Stacie Smith, 
who had a career-high 26 rebounds in a second-round victory over Artesia. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance (17-7) at La Quinta (24-3) -- Two all-around players who line up 
at center but play all over the court -- La Quinta's Amy Jalewalia and North 
Torrance's Laura Collins -- meet in this game. Collins, 6-0, 170 pounds, is an 
agile athlete who, like Jalewalia, can dominate inside or outside the key. But 
Collins' supporting cast is short. Carolyn Hiramoto (5-8), a senior 
guard/forward, is the only other North Torrance player averaging in double 
figures in scoring (10.8 points) and rebounding (6.1). UCLA-bound Jalewalia 
(33.4 points, 11.8 rebounds), last year's state scoring leader (32 points) has 
the height (6-2) to contend with Collins but not the bulk. La Quinta starts 
five seniors, four of whom started last year. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (13-12) at Lompoc (21-3) -- Estancia has the burden of a lengthy bus 
ride to Lompoc in Santa Barbara County to face the division's third-seeded 
team. The Eagles are led by guard Melody Earle (15.3 points) -- who recovered 
from bone chips in her ankle in time for the playoffs. Not only will Estancia 
have to overcome the trip, the Eagles will have to contend with 6-4 junior 
center Nicki Manzo (23.6 points, 14.6 rebounds), an all-Southern Section 
selection last year. Manzo set a single-season school rebounding record with 
308 before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A: 
</P>
<P>
La Canada (18-7) at Rancho Alamitos (19-3) -- Senior Jenny Newsome, a 5-9 
senior and all-Southern Section selection at guard last year, leads Rancho 
Alamitos with an average of 24 points and 12 rebounds a game. Center Anita 
Stecker (10 points, 12 rebounds), a 5-9 sophomore, and three-point threat 
Shellie Tsuji, a 5-3 guard who averages 12 points a game, are the Vaqueros' 
other leading scorers. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (20-5) at Costa Mesa (14-11) -- Costa Mesa is coming 
off its biggest victory of the season, a 47-45 triumph over Bellflower. The 
Mustangs are led by 5-10 guard/forward Olivia DeCamilli, perhaps the best 
freshman girl in Orange County. DeCamilli (5-10) averages 14.8 points and 11 
rebounds a game. The Knights are led by senior point guard Luisa Parra, who 
holds the school records for steals and assists in a game, season and career. 
She averages 4.2 assists and 6.5 points. The Knights' leading scorer is 5-9 
senior guard Kim Fischer (12.4 points). 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita (19-6) at Beaumont (17-6) -- Two outstanding shooting guards 
will meet in this game: Santa Margarita sophomore Kristen Mulligan (22.1 
points) and Beaumont senior Angella Richardson (19.3 points). Richardson, at 
5-3, is two inches shorter than Mulligan, but has made some big shots for the 
Cougars. She tied Edison's Fischer for most three-point baskets in a game in 
the Southern Section with 10 against Serrano in late January. 
</P>
<P>
Small Schools: 
</P>
<P>
California Lutheran (14-0) at Ribet Academy (15-5) -- California Lutheran won 
its first two playoff games by an average of almost 44 points. The undefeated 
C-Hawks' only weakness is height. The tallest starter is 5-8 Sara Geiger. The 
C-Hawks take on the fourth-seeded Ribet Academy Fighting Frogs at Foothill 
Intermediate School in La Canada. The Frogs have some height in 5-10 Becky 
Clark and 5-9 Kim Floyd. Ribet is led by Kate Stoll, a 5-8 junior guard who 
averages 19 points a game, and Floyd (11.8 points, 11.9 rebounds).

BREA-OLINDA GIRLS WILL PLAY THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brea-Olinda's second-round game in the 3-AA girls' basketball playoffs has been 
postponed until Thursday at the direction of the Southern Section office, 
Associate Commissioner Dean Crowley said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda will meet Foothill, which defeated Rim of the World, 64-47, Tuesday 
night at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill-Rim of the World game had been scheduled for Saturday night, but 
snow prevented Rim of the World from traveling through the Cajon Pass to 
Foothill. The game was rescheduled for Monday, but the weather forced another 
postponement. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill's game with top-seeded Brea-Olinda was moved to Thursday to give the 
Knights (15-9) a day of preparation, Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
A coin flip will determine the site of Thursday's game.

TITANS FEAST ON LEFTOVER RECRUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The football players everyone else wants are often the players the Cal State 
Fullerton program can't get. So Titan Coach Gene Murphy's staff works to find 
the quality players other schools pass on or overlook, for whatever reason. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made a living on people nobody else wanted," said assistant coach Jim 
Chaney, who coordinates the Titans' recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Titans have signed two players who missed much of their senior 
season with shoulder injuries. 
</P>
<P>
One, Mike Simmons of Bellflower High School, is a 6-foot-1, 190-pound 
quarterback who passed for 1,700 yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting full attention from the Pac-10 universities, from Washington -- 
also from Iowa and Utah, Hawaii and UCLA," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he reinjured his shoulder early last season and missed most of his 
team's games, the schools that had been recruiting him backed off. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they didn't want to invest their time to get me rehabilitated," 
Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
Then Fullerton moved in. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he's going to be a great player," Chaney said. "Other people (stopped 
recruiting) him because of his shoulder. But the injury isn't to his throwing 
arm. It's to his other arm." 
</P>
<P>
A condition of Simmons' scholarship offer was that he undergo shoulder surgery 
before coming to Fullerton, Chaney said. Simmons said he will undergo surgery 
in the next two weeks and, after a four-month rehabilitation, he hopes to be 
ready when fall practice begins in August. 
</P>
<P>
"I think as soon as I get past this shoulder problem I'll be right up there," 
Simmons said. "I think I'll break the records set by the quarterback they just 
had (Dan Speltz)." 
</P>
<P>
The other player recovering from a shoulder injury is outside linebacker Ben 
Drati of Los Angeles High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We've talked to the doctors and they say he's going to be fine," Chaney said. 
"Both kids have questionable medical histories, but their character is so good 
and their work habits are so good that we think they'll do well." 
</P>
<P>
By the way, here are the names of a few former Titans whom Chaney says no other 
school wanted: James Pruitt, Daren Gilbert, Ricky Calhoun and A.J. Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
Genia Miller scored 43 points on Saturday against 16th-ranked Hawaii, breaking 
her school record of 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Big West Conference chose a women's player of the week, it 
selected Fresno State's Simone Srubek. 
</P>
<P>
And as often happens when the player of the week is announced, there were a few 
differences of opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In three games last week, Srubek had 79 points, 44 rebounds and 21 blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, Miller had 64 points and 40 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's one of those things. I was surprised," Fullerton Coach Maryalyce 
Jeremiah said. "I just think 43 points . . . I'm not saying I don't think 
Simone shouldn't have gotten it. I'm just not very good at questioning when one 
my players doesn't get what I think they should get." 
</P>
<P>
The award is chosen by a Big West committee, said Jody McRoberts, assistant 
commissioner. If the vote is not unanimous, co-players of the week are often 
named. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to pick the player of the week," McRoberts said. "Definitely, we 
get complaints." 
</P>
<P>
One added note: Miller already had received the honor twice, and Srubek was a 
first-time recipient. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Parada, the basketball team's star bench-warmer, will be featured soon on 
ESPN. Actually it is Cedric Ceballos who will be the subject of a story 
tentatively scheduled to air at halftime of the Big East game Monday night. But 
Parada, the Titans' 5-foot-6, 130-pound, last-man-off-the-bench, will get some 
air time with his imitation of Dick Vitale -- ranting and raving about 
Ceballos, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's best hitter in the first 10 games has been second baseman Mate 
Borgogno, who is batting .450. He has 18 hits in 40 at-bats with one home run 
and 11 runs batted in. He is also three-for-five in stolen bases. . . . 
Volleyball signings: Debbie Quam (Mission Viejo High School), Becky Howlett 
(Rangeview HS, Aurora, Colo.), Michelle Paul (Alemany HS).. . . Additional 
football signings: Wide receiver Terrance Campbell of Banning High, a brother 
of Olympic hurdler Tonie Campbell, and cornerback Joseph Vaughn of Sylmar High. 
. . . The men's gymnastics team has a 7-16 record, but is ranked ninth 
nationally. That's because gymnastics rankings are based on average team score. 
. . . Basketball player Jill Matyuch has been selected to the regional GTE 
Academic All-American team, making her one of 40 players who will be considered 
for the national team.

TOSHIBA BORROWS PAGE FROM PEPSI IN MARKETING 'NOTEBOOK' COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At prices ranging from $2,700 to $4,000, the new "notebook" computers from 
Toshiba America Information Systems are hardly in the same consumer product 
category as 75-cent cans of Pepsi. But that hasn't stopped the Irvine-based 
subsidiary of the Japanese electronics giant from borrowing a page from the 
annals of soft-drink marketing. 
</P>
<P>
When Toshiba launched its miniature personal computers last week, it also 
unveiled a sales campaign dubbed "The Toshiba Challenge." Like its counterpart 
in the cola wars, the Toshiba Challenge asks consumers to compare the merits of 
its product with that of the larger, more established competitor -- in this 
case, Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>

Bill Johnson, vice president and general manager of Toshiba's computer systems 
division, says that nearly 200 people in eight cities have taken a "blind" 
comparative test so far, and the large majority have preferred the Toshiba 
products. Toshiba said it has hired an independent research firm to conduct the 
tests, in which computer users are asked to compare the features of two 
unidentified notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
The Toshiba machines are better, Johnson says, because they offer a screen 
that's much easier to read as well as a full-size, sculpted keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
So confident is Johnson of the products' merits that he is predicting that 
Toshiba will capture more than 50% of the notebook market, which he says now 
stands at 40,000 to 50,000 units per month and is growing at 60% a year. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Toshiba wins the short-term challenge -- and critics say one of the 
Toshiba models will be hurt by the lack of a floppy disk drive and all suffer 
from a shorter battery life than their rivals -- it won't be able to rest on 
its laurels. Johnson said NEC Corp. 
</P>
<P>
and Compaq are preparing new entries in the category.

TELE-LAWYER TO START GIVING TAX ADVICE

Tele-Lawyer, the company that pioneered legal-advice-by-phone, plans to launch 
a new income tax service Monday, again using a pay-per-call "900" telephone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Company founder Michael Cane said his new program will enable callers to ask 
questions of licensed tax preparers, to contact tax attorneys for specializing 
legal advice, or to request that copies of IRS forms be sent to them by 
facsimile machine. 
</P>
<P>
Callers will be billed 99 cents a minute for calls requesting tax forms; $2 per 
minute for calls to the tax preparers, and $3 a minute -- the standard 
Tele-Lawyer fee -- for calls to the tax attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
With the 900-line phone service, callers will be billed directly by their 
telephone companies, which in turn remit a portion of the money to Tele-Lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The original Tele-Lawyer service -- the first in the nation when it was 
launched in October, according to Cane -- now receives an average of 40 calls a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Cane said marketing for the new program will be aimed at the 53 million 
taxpayers who prepare their own returns and don't have much faith in the 
official IRS telephone answer service. 
</P>
<P>
Cane said that if bad tax advice costs a taxpayer money, his company will 
reimburse the individual. 
</P>
<P>
The number for the company's tax service, which Cane said he intends to operate 
on a year-around basis, will be 900-InfoTax. Cane said the service will be 
available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.

General Automation Inc.: The Anaheim computer company reported net income of 
$23,000 for the second fiscal quarter, contrasted with a loss of $989,000 for 
the corresponding period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 declined 19%, to $8.3 million from $10.2 
million in 1988. For the first six months, the company's net income totaled 
$77,000, contrasted with a loss of $1.9 million a year earlier. Sales dropped 
13%, to $17.3 million from $19.8 million. Leonard Mackenzie, GA's vice chairman 
and president, attributed the sales decline to "an exceedingly poor business 
climate throughout our industry during the latter part of 1989."

LOVE IS TOPIC FOR THE 'WOMEN OF MANHATTAN'

<P>
The women in John Patrick Shanley's "Women of Manhattan," now at the Way Off 
Broadway playhouse, are all attractive -- comely, intelligent (well, Billie is 
a little suspect) and neurotic, but only to the point of being interesting, not 
exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
They have different problems, and the same problem. Love -- its vagaries, the 
vacuum it creates when you have it and the vacuum it creates when you don't -- 
drapes their days. Love unites them; it's what they talk about, really, when 
they talk about men, marriage and sex. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, Billie (Denison Glass) is a flashy-looking blonde who drinks 
and is plagued by too much imagination. She's married to Bob (Jim Bogner) and 
has affairs on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Judy (Ricci Thomas) wears mannish Marlene Dietrich clothes and has an 
incendiary wit, used mostly for self-protection. She's straight but keeps 
ending up in bed with gay men. That is, until she meets the rascally Duke 
(Godfrey Huguley). 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Louise (Molly Kincaid) is the pretty realist; with her honey-dipped 
Southern vowels and style, she's a sensible Scarlett O'Hara. Her boyfriend just 
left her, but she's trying to be brave. She keeps his dirty sneakers in the 
living room to remind her of what was. 
</P>
<P>
Director Tony Reverditto has brought a strong trio of actresses to his tiny 
Santa Ana theater to play Shanley's New Yorkers. Thomas is witty and winning, 
all wrapped up in a cocoon of healthy cynicism, as she provides punch for 
Shanley's edgy writing. Kincaid does as much with her big-eyed expressions as 
she does with her natural handling of the dialogue; and she gives an affecting 
bravado to Rhonda Louise's cathartic outburst at play's end. 
</P>
<P>
Denison Glass isn't quite as on as the other two (she tries too much at times, 
over-amplifying Billie's loopiness), but there are many moments when she's 
lovably odd, and it's easy to take the character all the way in. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, providing accessible characters is one of Shanley's trademarks. He's 
written many, in both his plays ("Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" and "Savage in 
Limbo) and screenplays ("Moonstruck"), and it's no surprise that we can get 
close to this threesome. 
</P>
<P>
That's really "Women's" strength, and what makes it enough of a pleasure. It's 
not, however, the best of Shanley's work. The plotting is slight, the 
conversational writing slips toward the glib and no real resolutions for the 
threesome are forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
Still, by emphasizing the breezy quality of the humor, Reverditto keeps "Women" 
both smart and entertaining. He gets help from Carole L. Cooney and Del 
DePierro's economical but good-looking set and Alex Saltzmann's restrained and 
effective lighting. 
</P>

BIGGEST PRICE RISE IN 7 YRS.; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD, FUEL HIKES CITED IN 1.1% JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retail prices soared 1.1% last month -- their steepest jump in 7 1/2 years -- 
as consumers suffered from the left-over effects of December's high food and 
fuel costs, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, presidential Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the 
jump "disappointing news" but said the Administration expects the core rate to 
decline steadily over the year. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that January's price surge overstates the true pace of inflation 
and that price increases should moderate in the following months. There was 
concern, however, about higher prices posted for items outside the food and 
fuel categories. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said the increase in its seasonally adjusted consumer 
price index was the largest since a 1.1% gain in June, 1982. The department 
said 60% of the January increase came in food and energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
The frigid weather a month earlier -- it was the fourth-coldest December since 
records were first kept 96 years ago -- drove down fuel supplies and damaged 
fresh fruits and vegetables, driving prices up. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said food and energy prices should ease by March. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we're already beginning to see food and energy prices come down," 
said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala 
Cynwyd, Pa. "Certainly, starting with the March CPI number, we'll see much 
smaller increases." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there was concern that the so-called core inflation -- prices 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors -- rose 0.6% last month, twice 
December's increase and the largest since an identical 0.6% jump in January, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful that this is a bulge that will be temporary in nature, but 
inflation requires eternal vigilance, and we remain on a policy of wanting 
steady growth with low inflation," White House spokesman Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, noted that 
in addition to food and energy, all other categories posted increases except 
apparel, which was unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"The surprising breadth of the increases . . . suggests that core inflation is 
4.5% to 5%," he said. "If we're stuck there, that means the Fed is stuck." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Tuesday that a 
reversal of the "horrendous' January consumer price rise is under way but added 
that inflationary pressures remain too high and indicated that the Fed will 
continue its tight-credit and high-interest policies. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, food prices advanced 1.8% while energy costs were up 1.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Dairy prices continued their upward spiral, rising 2.4% after increases of 2.2% 
in December, 1.7% in November and 1.4% in October. Analysts attributed the 
hikes to last year's drought, which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows. 
</P>
<P>
Other categories showing price increases included new-car prices, 0.7%; 
entertainment costs, 0.6%; housing expenses, 0.7%, half of which was attributed 
to a 2% increase for fuel and other utilities; medical care, 0.6%, and 
transportation costs, 2.1%.

<P>
a dramatic late-night rescue, police and neighbors helped save a Costa Mesa 
woman and her young daughter from a blazing, smoke-filled house, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-year-old April Thousand called 911 about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday and told 
dispatchers that her home was on fire, Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Tim Holbrook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Three police officers, who were the first to arrive at the burning two-story 
house in the 300 block of 16th Place, heard cries for help from within the 
home. The officers broke down the door and two of them entered, Holbrook said. 
They crawled along a hallway and into a bedroom where they found Linda 
Thousand, 31, asleep in her bed. 
</P>
<P>
As the officers led Thousand out of the house, she screamed for her daughter, 
Holbrook said. The officers went back into the house to find April but by that 
time neighbors had used a ladder to rescue the girl from an upstairs bedroom, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters then arrived and put out the blaze, which authorities believe was 
caused by grease on the stove catching fire, the sergeant said. The first floor 
of the house was gutted.

<P>
A fire that swept through a Canyon Country mobile home and killed a 54-year-old 
woman was started accidentally, apparently when the woman fell asleep while 
smoking, authorities said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had not been positively identified this morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 10 p.m. Tuesday by other residents in the Cordova 
Mobile Estates at 27361 Sierra Highway, Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Bob Dobes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dobes said the victim had been in a rear bedroom of the double-wide trailer by 
herself. A man believed to be her husband, whose name was also withheld, 
arrived home and found the trailer on fire but was unable to save her because 
of the flames, Dobes said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused several small explosions within the mobile home, Dobes said. 
Firefighters put the blaze out in about 15 minutes.

ASTRONAUT'S SORE THROAT DELAYS ATLANTIS' BLASTOFF

Atlantis' commander got a sore throat today, forcing NASA to postpone for at 
least 24 hours the launch of the space shuttle on a secret, all-military 
mission to put a spy satellite in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a postponement due to the illness of an astronaut. This is the 
first time in the space program," NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said. 
</P>
<P>
A space agency statement said a bad weather forecast was also a factor in the 
postponement, but officials said that if not for the illness, they would have 
continued the countdown, hoping for clear skies by launch time early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
NASA said Navy Capt. John O. Creighton "developed an upper respiratory tract 
infection during the last 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
"The commander's health and weather will be evaluated on Thursday to determine 
if the launch will be attempted on Friday morning," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, astronaut Thomas K. Mattingly was taken off the Apollo 13 crew a few 
days before the flight was to lift off for the moon. But backup astronaut Jack 
Swigert replaced him without delaying the flight. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came shortly before technicians were to begin pumping more 
than half a million gallons of propellant into Atlantis' fuel tank for the 
four-day mission, which was to end at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
A bleak weather forecast early today had gradually improved to a 50-50 chance 
for a launch Thursday. But the outlook for Friday and Saturday is even worse, 
with one cold front moving out and another moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Pentagon mission is classified, the space agency would not provide 
the exact launch time, saying only that it would occur between midnight and 4 
a.m. Thursday. However, sources said Atlantis was to lift off at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantis' orbit reportedly will cover a greater area of the globe than any 
previous shuttle.

Lee A. Iacocca today announced an advertising campaign aimed at boosting 
Chrysler Corp.'s sagging sales, complaining that rival auto makers from Japan 
are cloaked in a "Teflon kimono." 
</P>
<P>
The Chrysler chairman, surrounded by 20 cars in a huge hotel ballroom used more 
for hosting political fund-raising dinners than for glitzy news conferences, 
told reporters that the No. 3 U.S. auto maker will "speak out in its ads" to 
emphasize American quality. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca began by showing a Chrysler commercial slated to air March 1. "I think 
America's getting an inferiority complex about Japan," Iacocca says in the 
commercial. "Everything from Japan is perfect and everything from America is 
lousy." 
</P>
<P>
As an elaborate light display bathed Chrysler's car display, Iacocca complained 
that "Japan today is wrapped in a Teflon kimono." 
</P>
<P>
He said that although he is not belittling the Japanese -- who provide some of 
his company's line -- Americans must learn that U.S. cars are also high 
quality.

A House panel voted today to subpoena the suspended executive director of the 
Passaic, N.J., Public Housing Authority, who has been accused of collecting 
multiple salaries from the agency totaling more than $245,000 in one year. 
</P>
<P>
The House subcommittee investigating problems at the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development voted unanimously to subpoena Paul A. Marguglio, who was 
suspended from his job after an audit by the HUD inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also voted to subpoena Marguglio's wife, Louise, and the authority's 
suspended deputy executive director, Donald V. Pieri. Both were accused by 
auditors of receiving excessive pay. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the Government Operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing, said none of the three had responded to 
requests to appear before the panel voluntarily.

The population of Tokyo fell to an estimated 11.9 million as of Jan. 1, down 
0.11% from a year ago, its first decline in nine years, the metropolitan 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The population included 211,067 non-Japanese, among them 90,216 South Koreans, 
61,860 Chinese, 15,059 Americans and 10,898 Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
A city official attributed the decline to a low birthrate and to people moving 
out of Tokyo because of the high cost of land and housing.

Prosecutors have launched criminal proceedings against Pamyat, a Russian 
nationalist group that has been accused of anti-Semitic actions, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish groups have been demanding for years that Pamyat, a loosely knit 
organization with affiliates nationwide, be prosecuted for provocations against 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Literaturnaya Gazeta, a literary weekly, said Moscow prosecutors are pursuing 
charges against Pamyat of "inciting national and racial hatred and strife." 
According to the newspaper, Pamyat was charged because of a statement published 
in another newspaper calling for a campaign to "de-Zionize" the country. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the thousands of Soviet Jews emigrating to the West say they are doing 
so in part because of a reported rise in anti-Semitism. The Soviet press has 
responded to the reports recently by carrying statements from government 
agencies condemning people who fan inter-ethnic strife and promising to 
investigate.

Environmentalists accused White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu today of 
leading President Bush astray on environmental policy, specifically charging 
Sununu with undercutting Administration efforts to protect wetlands, toughen 
clean air laws and fight global warming. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Bush, eight major environmental groups warned Sununu was 
undermining Bush's campaign promises to the American public to be a strong 
environmental President. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, you articulated laudable environmental goals, but it appears 
your chief of staff is not committed to meeting them," the groups wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists asked Bush for an emergency meeting to "clarify the 
direction in which you are headed on the environment."

The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell more than 3% today in its 
third-biggest single-day dive ever and worst since the worldwide stock market 
crash in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Traders blamed heavy computer-guided selling by foreign brokerage firms for the 
decline and said there was no panic selling. 
</P>
<P>
Amid concerns about possible interest rate increases, the index had already 
fallen nearly 565 points in the previous two trading days. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the most widely followed index 
on the exchange, fell 1,161.19 points, or 3.15%, closing at 35,734.33. 
</P>
<P>
It was the index's sharpest decline since a plunge of 1,203.23 on Oct. 23, 
1987, after a round-the-world stock market crash. The largest single-day plunge 
in Tokyo was 3,836.48 points Oct. 20, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
With most investors on the sidelines today, the analysts said, a lack of buy 
orders allowed the index to fall sharply. They said market sentiment was not 
necessarily as pessimistic as the plunge indicated.

Sock Shop of Britain, a corporate success story of the 1980s that helped create 
a new market in fancy footwear, appointed outside administrators today to run 
the troubled business. 
</P>
<P>
Its French-born founder, Sophie Mirman, made the move after the business, which 
made buying socks and hosiery as easy as picking up a newspaper, incurred big 
losses after an unsuccessful attempt to break into the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Mirman, whose motto was, "Where there are legs, there is Sock Shop potential," 
helped reshape the image of socks as fun gifts featuring such whimsical designs 
as tartan plaids and animal motifs. 
</P>
<P>
A former secretary, Mirman conceived the idea of opening her own outlet when 
she combed London on a cold winter day in search of cream wool tights. 
</P>
<P>
She opened the first Sock Shop in 1983 in a subway station near London's 
fashionable Harrods department store and in a few years had 70 shops throughout 
Britain.

Acknowledging that the slump in the computer industry has hurt its business, 
Digital Equipment Corp. said today it may report its first quarterly loss in 
its 32-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't categorically deny that we may report a loss," said Mark Steinkrauss, 
Digital Equipment's director of investor relations, referring to the company's 
third quarter ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
After years of vigorous growth, Digital, the nation's second-largest computer 
maker, has been hurt by a widespread slowdown in the industry at a time when it 
is making new, long-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
Steinkrauss said about 250 Digital employees had left under a continuing 
incentive program aimed at reducing its work force by 800 employees. "A number 
of analysts have said the way to deal with (decreasing revenues) is the people 
issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
News in the Wall Street Journal of a possible loss led to a sell-off in the 
stock of the Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker. The stock slid to a new 
52-week low of $71.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. At midday it was off 
$1.375 to $72.625 in active trading.

The U.S. film "Music Box," starring Jessica Lange as an attorney who defends 
her father against charges of war crimes, won a Golden Bear -- the top award -- 
as the 40th Berlin film festival came to a close Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Music Box," directed by Costa-Gavras, shared its Golden Bear with a 1969 Czech 
work titled "Skylarks on the String." 
</P>
<P>
The latter film, which criticizes the former Communist state, was banned by 
authorities there for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Another Golden Bear went as a special anniversary prize to American director 
Oliver Stone for his film "Born on the Fourth of July," starring Tom Cruise as 
a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran who becomes a champion of the anti-war 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
A short animated film from Italy called "Mistertao" won the third and final 
Golden Bear awarded this year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Silver Bears were presented in various categories, including one to 
American actor Morgan Freeman and actress Jessica Tandy for the best joint 
performance in Bruce Beresford's "Driving Miss Daisy."

Former "shock TV" talk show host Morton Downey Jr. has only $100 in his pocket, 
and is seeking protection from a limousine company and other creditors under 
federal bankruptcy laws, court papers indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Downey listed liabilities of nearly $2.4 million, including a mortgage of 
$628,000 and federal taxes of $500,000, in a petition filed last week in U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court seeking protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, who lives in suburban Englewood, listed assets that include commissions 
and syndication rights worth $6.3 million and $500,000 in real property, 
according to financial statements that also say he has only $320 in the bank 
and $100 cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's attorney, Brian D. Spector, would not comment on whether Downey's 
financial troubles were related to the demise of "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," 
a nationally syndicated talk program that featured the host ranting about 
issues and taunting guests until it was canceled after two years. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's creditors include more than 75 banks, businesses and agencies -- 
including posh New York boutiques and restaurants -- a New Jersey limousine 
service and New York City's Parking Violations Bureau, court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
A pioneer of shock television, "The Morton Downey Jr. Show" initially enjoyed 
good ratings after its debut in October, 1987, but began a slide as Downey 
repeatedly got in trouble with the law. The show was canceled in September, 
1989.

CURTAIN TO FALL ON 'CHORUS LINE' AFTER 15 YEARS

"A Chorus Line" will close March 31 after 15 years at the Shubert Theater and a 
total box office gross of more than $146.5 million, producer Joseph Papp 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the decision to close the longest-running musical in Broadway history 
"a significant moment in the history of the Broadway theater," Papp said, "A 
Chorus Line" will live on in amateur productions, rights for which have been 
available since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The show has already been performed professionally in 22 countries abroad, 
beginning in Toronto in 1976. When it closes, it will have been seen by almost 
6.6 million people at the Shubert Theater alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer Prize-winning show, its foreign productions and the 1985 film 
version have netted $37.8 million for Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival, its 
chief beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
It has made possible the festival's summer Shakespeare productions in Central 
Park and financed hundreds of productions at the festival's five-hall Public 
Theater housed in the historic Astor Library building. Papp is producing 
Shakespeare's entire canon of 36 plays. 
</P>
<P>
"A Chorus Line" resulted from the late choreographer Michael Bennett's workshop 
interviews with a group of Broadway "gypsies," the faceless dancers and singers 
who make up the chorus of musicals. It opened at Papp's off-Broadway Newman 
Theater on April 16, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The show was impelled onto Broadway the following July 25 and will have had 
6,104 performances when the final curtain falls at the Shubert Theater. It won 
a record of nine Tony Awards in the 1976 edition of the Tonys and garnered a 
Special Tony Award in 1984 as the longest-running show on Broadway. It had 
passed "Grease" with its 3,389th performance Sept. 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The musical was unique for being performed without intermission and without any 
real scenery except for mirrored back wall screens. The book was written by the 
late novelist, James Kirkwood, and Nicholas Dante. Marvin Hamlisch wrote the 
music and Edward Kleban the words.

Two of the tabloids' favorite subjects -- Roseanne Barr and Elvis -- will be on 
display for a three-night stand in San Carlos, Calif., starting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Barr's first stand-up show in three years, and the sitcom star says

new husband Tom Arnold as an Elvis impersonator.

"I'm singing," Barr said. "I know my fans have waited a long time to hear 
that." But Barr declined to give a preview of her Elvis vocals at a promotional 
appearance in a $5,000-a-night penthouse suite at a San Francisco hotel. "I'm 
afraid if I gave it away, they (her fans) would go wild, kind of like the 'War 
of the Worlds,' " she cracked.

Janet Jackson shares her brother Michael's taste in rehearsal halls, but 
apparently not in main courses. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael Jackson rehearsed at the Pensacola Civic Center to prepare for his 
1988 "Bad" tour, his chef whipped up vegetarian entrees garnished with flowers 
from the Hilton Hotel florist shop, hotel employees said. 
</P>
<P>
But Janet Jackson, who is using the 10,000-seat Civic Center before starting 
her first solo national tour in Miami, has developed a fondness for Chicken 
Supreme sandwiches from McGuire's Irish Pub &amp; Brewery a few blocks from the 
Civic Center and Hilton, the Pensacola News Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
"From the day they arrived, Janet Jackson's roadies and sound crew have made us 
their second home," said Susi Lyon, promotion director for McGuire's.

The 24-year-old sister of deposed heavyweight champion Mike Tyson died of an 
apparent heart attack today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Denise Anderson was found unconscious by her husband in their home in Queens. 
</P>
<P>
Initial reports indicated that Anderson, who weighed between 300 and 400 
pounds, may have died of cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 23, lost his undisputed world heavyweight title Feb. 11 when he was 
knocked out in the 10th round by James (Buster) Douglas in Tokyo, in one of 
boxing's greatest upsets. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Don King, Tyson's promoter, said the fighter was "very, very 
dejected" after hearing the news. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fire and Fear," a book about Tyson, author Jose Torres quoted the fighter 
as saying: "You know something? I never read a book or played school when I was 
a child. I didn't relate to that. I remember being close to my sister, Denise.

METS' CONE TRIPLES HIS SALARY TO $1.3 MILLION BY ARBITRATION

Pitcher David Cone tripled his salary to $1.3 million today when arbitrator 
Raymond Goetz picked his figure rather than the New York Mets' offer of 
$815,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cone's salary is a 291% increase from the $332,500 he made last season, when he 
was 14-8 with a 3.52 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
"The major factor I think is the fact that he has had an outstanding two 
seasons with only a minor blemish during a four-start period in 1989," said 
Steven Fehr, Cone's agent. "I thought our number was very reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it our best shot," Mets Senior Vice President Al Harazin said. "We 
presented our cases as best we could and we abide by the arbiter's decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Fehr said the Mets' "argument was geared principally to looking at other 
three-plus and four-plus pitchers and saying that on a one-year basis, he was 
not better or as good."

DESORMEAUX PROVING SELF IN CALIF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of his meteoric career as a jockey, a week in which he won five races 
would have constituted a serious slump for Kent Desormeaux, 19. 
</P>
<P>
But after winning five races in the last six days at Santa Anita, he was 
thrilled -- and for good reason. This was his first week in California, and 
these victories suggest that he is going to compete successfully against the 
toughest riding colony in the world. 
</P>
<P>
When he and agent Gene Short left Maryland, where they had dominated the sport 
for more than three years, they exuded confidence that they would succeed 
wherever they went. But they knew that it is an enormous risk for any jockey to 
move to a new track where he doesn't have solid contacts with top stables. Who 
could forget the fate of Steve Cauthen, New York's superstar jockey, who moved 
to California and lost 111 consecutive races? 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux had vacillated for months as he tried to decide whether to try New 
York or California. A New York venture would have been easier, he knew. The 
competition wasn't as deep, and he had already ridden for many of the top 
stables there. California offered better purses, better weather, better 
ambiance, but most trainers there knew Desormeaux only by reputation. It 
wouldn't be easy to break in. 
</P>
<P>
When the jockey decided to go west, Short left two weeks ahead to lay the 
groundwork. 
</P>
<P>
"I went around introducing myself to the trainers -- just the way I'd done when 
we had come from Louisiana to Maryland," the agent said. "And I was taking a 
last look to see if we were going to get accepted like we thought." 
</P>
<P>
Short was encouraged that virtually every horseman at Santa Anita was willing 
to give the newcomer a shot. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, Short was getting commitments from second-rate 
stables -- the ones presumably beneath the notice of agents for such jockeys as 
Chris McCarron and Laffit Pincay Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But when Desormeaux arrived, Short had already lined up enough decent mounts 
that the jockey had a chance to begin respectably. The rider made the most of 
his opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
When he was dominating the Maryland circuit, his most impressive virtue was his 
versatility; he was wedded to no particular style. So when he arrived in 
California, he had no difficulty adapting to the speed-oriented game there. 
"The track is so speed-favoring that everybody sends their horse out of the 
gate," Desormeaux said. "Every rider is bellied down the way I would normally 
do from the 16th pole to the wire. If you're not running 1-2-3-4 early you're 
not going to get much. And you get a lot tighter riding because everybody is 
looking to occupy the same place." 
</P>
<P>
Although he was blanked his first day at Santa Anita, last Wednesday, he won 
with an even-money favorite the next afternoon and said: "I never thought that 
winning a $10,000 claimer could feel so good. I got the monkey off my back." He 
proceeded to finish the week with five winners from 33 mounts, a solid 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who's watching him knows now that he can ride," said Jeff Siegel, a 
handicapper and manager of the Clover Racing Stable. "He rides aggressively. 
He's a good finisher. I don't think he's got a weakness. He's going to fit 
here. But so far he hasn't gotten any choice mounts."
