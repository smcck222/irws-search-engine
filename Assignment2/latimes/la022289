"I knew that drivers' attitudes in L.A. had hardened, but this really shook 
me," KNX radio reporter Chris Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon was on his way to work at about 3:45 a.m. Tuesday when he came upon an 
accident that had left a motorist lying in the middle of a lane on the Pomona 
Freeway near the City of Industry. Simon said he pulled off on the inside 
shoulder and watched to his horror as a truck passed over the victim -- 
miraculously not hitting him. But at least one car tried the same maneuver and 
appeared to strike the unidentified man, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing is, traffic had slowed to 5 or 10 m.p.h. and they could see 
it was a human being," Simon recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as he tried to redirect traffic and signal for help, "people started 
honking at me and cursing. It was like they were saying, 'How dare you slow me 
down?' " 
</P>
<P>
Finally, two truck drivers helped Simon set up flares and call for an 
ambulance. The injured motorist, who was not identified, was in guarded 
condition at a San Dimas hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people seem to lose their humanity when they slip behind that steel 
armor," Simon concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Silver-tongued devils, they weren't. Instead, police say, the modus operandi of 
the two young men was to take female companions up on a rolling part of El 
Sereno known as Elephant Hills, then fire their handguns into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way they picked up women," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. John 
Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the neighborhood, which borders South Pasadena, weren't so 
impressed. They phoned police, who arrested the Revolver Romeos. Two female 
companions with them were released. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to step on someone famous in Los Angeles, what with all the walks of 
fame honoring movie stars, astronauts, athletes, cowboys, country singers, 
Latino celebrities and starfish. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the 4-year-old Rock Walk of Fame, a sidewalk display of musicians' 
handprints and signatures (or "X" marks, perhaps) in front of a guitar shop on 
Sunset Boulevard. The Rock Walk took in its first posthumous members Tuesday. 
Legendary singers Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, Marvin Gaye and Roy Orbison were 
cited in plaques placed on a special Wall of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
The next rock inductee may be Elvis Presley. "But we don't know whether it 
would be posthumously," said spokesman Steve Tarson. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of police in a city that includes Hollywood, Daryl F. Gates knows 
something about grabbing the media's attention. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento to discuss his exploratory candidacy for governor, he appeared 
before a not-very-attentive group of reporters to repeat his call to outlaw 
assault rifles. Suddenly, he brandished a tape recorder. What followed, one 
reporter noted, probably sounded like Manila the night Marcos was driven from 
power. 
</P>
<P>
It was a furious fusillade of gunfire that had been taped by police atop the 
Ramparts Division building on New Year's Eve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Showing off his expertise, Gates explained, "The BOOM-BOOM-BOOMs are AK-47s or 
some other semiautomatic. The BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOMs are automatics, 
which are already against the law." 
</P>
<P>
When he had finished, Gates demonstrated less expertise with his tape recorder. 
The machine kept spewing out gunfire sounds as he fumbled to hit the "off" 
button. Finally, he said, "How do you turn this thing off?" An aide rushed to 
the rescue at Code 2 speed and neutralized the recorder. 
</P>
<P>
A message from the scene of a fire overheard on the radio frequency used by Los 
Angeles city firefighters: 
</P>
<P>
"Will you contact the firefighter who's in quarters and tell him to turn the 
oven off?"

BAD SCENE IN SOUTH TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Critics of the U.S. government's refugee policies have long complained that 
they are haphazard and blatantly political. But rarely have the shortcomings 
been illustrated as dramatically as they are today in south Texas, where U.S. 
immigration officials are struggling to stem a rising tide of would-be refugees 
from Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials are trying to make a series of 
changes in the way their agency handles Nicaraguans who seek political asylum 
in this country. All are aimed at discouraging the refugees whose requests for 
asylum the INS considers spurious because they are based more on economics than 
on politics. South Texas is bearing the brunt of the refugee influx because 
ports of entry along its border are close to Central America, so the change in 
approach will include beefing up personnel in the area. More Border Patrol 
agents will be assigned to deter illegal entries while on-scene State 
Department officials will speed the process by helping INS hearing officers 
assess the validity of asylum claims filed by Nicaraguans. The would-be 
refugees whose initial applications are rejected will still be able to appeal 
through the courts. But, in a significant change from past practice, they will 
have to stay in south Texas while the appeals are adjudicated. Where they will 
stay is in tents pitched on the grounds of an existing detention center near 
Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
The effort by the INS to speed up asylum appeals is commendable, but other 
aspects of the policy changes are of dubious value. For example, INS officials 
hope that the prospects of living in a tent for months or even years will 
discourage many would-be refugees from trying to get into the United States. 
But attorneys will challenge that approach in court as soon as they can, and it 
may well be ruled illegal. It is also unlikely to work for long if the 
smugglers who help refugees get from Nicaragua to the U.S. border bypass south 
Texas and concentrate their human cargo on other ports of entry like El Paso 
and San Ysidro. 
</P>
<P>
The new get-tough approach is no help to local governments affected by 
immigrants -- not just poor border towns in south Texas but faraway cities like 
Los Angeles and Miami as well. Historically, immigrants congregate where their 
predecessors settled, straining local resources like schools and public 
hospitals, and Nicaraguans are no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's approach to refugee problems in south Texas reflects a 
crisis-management mentality rather than thoughtful long-term planning, but the 
INS alone is not responsible. Congress has rarely been consistent or coherent 
in outlining the refugee policies that the INS must enforce. For example, no 
one on Capitol Hill or in the White House seems to be giving much thought to 
what the government should do with 10,000 or so Contras and their families now 
that the war against the Sandinistas is winding down. A sound Contra 
resettlement policy might lay a foundation for a better overall refugee policy. 
</P>
<P>
The most distasteful aspect of the new Nicaraguan refugee policy is its 
hypocrisy. The influxof Nicaraguans might never have threatened to get out of 
hand if former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III, during one of the Reagan 
Administration's periodic outbursts against the Sandinistas, had not announced 
that he was making it easier for Nicaraguans to enter the United States as 
refugees. By changing policy now, INS officials are making an about-face. 
Federal officials could more easily deal with Nicaraguan refugees -- and, for 
that matter, the many refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala -- by granting 
them extended-voluntary-departure status under existing immigration laws. But, 
in the long-term, Congress must come to grips with precisely whata refugee is 
under U.S. law -- whether he comes from Central America or the Soviet Bloc -- 
andhow requests for asylum here can be handled consistently, yet humanely.

The most recent honeymoon of the Europeans with satellite television (Part I, 
Feb.8) includes an experience that escaped your London correspondent: the first 
24-hour-a-day satellite channel in Spanish in Europe known as Galavision. It is 
a mixture of news and information services called ECO. It is actually a new 
opportunity for the dial of the Spanish-speaking people in Western Europe.

SOUTHLAND CONGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prof. Gordon Fielding is only partly right ("Focus on Congestion, Not More 
Freeways," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 6). The focus should be on reducing the use of 
automobiles and trucks, as he says. 
</P>
<P>
But he is wrong to ignore the essential cause of our dilemma, the gross subsidy 
our society presently provides the motorist and particularly, the trucking 
industry. It would require an increase of 50 cents per gallon, alone, to 
reimburse the property taxpayers for local government services that drivers do 
not now pay for. 
</P>
<P>
He is also right to call attention to the huge financial cost needed to pay for 
" . . . Building our way out. . . ." He says it would cost 18 cents per gallon, 
but he doesn't say for how many years. Another, possibly more explicit, figure 
is $100 billion, or $25,000 per family, for all the families in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, his conclusion is (almost) exactly right. We must place the cost of 
transportation on the shoulders of the user, not on the community as a whole. 
He should also have instructed us that the problem affects not only traffic 
congestion; it also directly affects, grossly and adversely, our environment 
and our economy.

GOVERNMENT AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed reading Alvin L. Schorr's column "Banks Don't Have to Beg; Why Should 
the Poor?" (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 2). Former President Reagan continually harangued 
us with his declaration that we should get government off our backs. "Less 
government is good government." Yet, how quickly do corporate interests flock 
to Washington with their lobbyists for government contracts and bailouts when 
the going gets tough. Yet, when labor and the poor plead their case, they're 
told to "pick themselves up by their bootstraps." In other words, do it without 
the help of government. Do not do as we do, but do as we say. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue of Schorr's column was a news item about Pasadena's welfare 
queen convicted in 1983 of perpetrating $377,000 in welfare fraud, the largest 
in U.S. history. Compared to the billions of dollars which have been lost in 
the savings and loan scams, mergers and takeovers, defense procurement scams, 
billions of dollars lost to Third World countries in imprudent bank loans, the 
queen of welfare fraud seems like small potatoes indeed. Welfare fraud compared 
to corporate fraud can be compared to an anthill standing alongside Mount 
Vesuvius. But a needle can take on the appearance of the Washington Monument if 
it is held close to the eye.

Fielding's column was interesting and had some excellent suggestions but it 
certainly did not focus on the cause of downtown congestion -- too many people 
driving into the downtown area. The reason more and more people are coming 
downtown is plain enough to see if you come downtown -- high-rise office 
buildings of 40-plus stories. It is these hives that attract the bees. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the more hives you build the more bees you will attract and 
the more congestion you will have. Does this mean that our mayor and the 
developers want more congestion or don't see the connection between beehives 
and bees? Of course not. They know. But they have a plan to relieve future 
gridlock -- the subway at $259 million a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Will the subway relieve congestion? It hasn't in San Francisco, Miami or any 
other city where it has been tried. They are all multibillion-dollar white 
elephants that have to be subsidized by the taxpayer. But the Los Angeles Metro 
Rail will be different say its sponsors. It will be as successful as New York 
City's subway. At the rate we are building high-rises downtown that may well 
prove true. I can hardly wait.

AND HE DEFINITELY CARES; SANDY ALOMAR JR. WANTS HIS FUTURE DECIDED SOON

<P>
Not that all of this is turning his brain to stew. But the other day, Padre 
catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. was standing in the shower when he heard his name and 
a trade mentioned on the television set. He threw back the curtain, splashed 
into the living room and dripped through nearly a minute of a sportscast that, 
alas, was only talking about more rumors. 
</P>
<P>
The question, of course, is not whether he was still getting the shampoo out of 
his ears 4 hours later. The question is, how did he ever hear a television set 
from inside the shower in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
"You no understand," he said. "I am so wondering about my future, every night I 
keep the sports turned up. Turned way up." 
</P>
<P>
Not that all of this is turning his brain to stew. But when the news came 
Tuesday that the Seattle Mariners would probably be dealing with the New York 
Mets instead of the Padres, one of Sandy Alomar Jr.'s close friends predicted 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, oh no," Padre infielder Joey Cora said. "Sandy always think he is going 
to Seattle. Hearing this will hurt him bad. Oh man. It's only going to get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his teammates worry about him. Others wonder about him. Mostly, though, 
they just try not to look too closely. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Alomar Jr., 22, last year's Topps minor league player of the year and one 
of baseball's top prospects, is this spring's Nowhere Man. He has no future 
here. He has no present here. He has only a uniform that doesn't look or feel 
right and a hotel room where he escapes nightly by playing Nintendo video 
games. 
</P>
<P>
His problem is simple -- he is not good enough to play ahead of All-Star 
catcher Benito Santiago but too good to sit the bench behind him, and certainly 
too good to return to the minor leagues, where last year for triple-A Las Vegas 
he hit .297 with 16 homers and 71 RBIs in 93 games. 
</P>
<P>
He and the Padres thought the solution would be simple -- trade him this winter 
for a top player, giving Alomar a deserved chance and the Padres the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing has happened as it should have. Even though Alomar, 6-feet-5, 200 
pounds, is considered the top catching prospect in baseball since Santiago, and 
catcher is baseball's hardest position to fill, McKeon has been unable to put 
him in a deal for top talent. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City wouldn't give up outfielder Danny Tartabull. Cleveland wouldn't 
give up third baseman Brook Jacoby or outfielder Joe Carter. Texas wouldn't 
give up third baseman Steve Buechele. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle wouldn't give up pitcher Mark Langston. Montreal wouldn't give up third 
baseman Tim Wallach or outfielder Hubie Brooks. The New York Yankees, as of 
yet, won't give up third baseman Mike Pagliarulo. And now it appears the 
Atlanta Braves might not give up outfielder Dale Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Some say it is because McKeon has overvalued someone who is, after all, still a 
minor leaguer. Others say it is because scouts are worried about the 
arthroscopic knee surgery Alomar underwent last August, even though it is 
obvious that he has completely recovered. 
</P>
<P>
"How much is one player worth, I don't know," McKeon said. "But you just don't 
give somebody away." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alomar: "I don't know why they can't trade me. But it is not my job to 
know why. I've got enough things to worry me right now." 
</P>
<P>
He has been taught well about how to accept this, by brother Roberto (Padre 
second baseman) and father Sandy (Padre coach). He has been taught to act tough 
and look uncaring. 
</P>
<P>
But contrary to most expectations, he is not like his brother or his father. As 
anyone who saw the boys grow in their seaside Puerto Rican village will tell 
you, Sandy is his mother's son. He is the family's sensitive, boyish one. He is 
the only one who ever quit baseball because he wanted to ride dirt bikes. He 
cannot act what he does not feel or appear as anything but himself. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what he feels like?" Cora asked. "He feels like a leftover. He feels 
like, there is the Padres, and then there is him. He feels like nobody is 
counting on him for nothing. It is so hard. And it gets harder." 
</P>
<P>
Brother Roberto, ever the fighter, grabs at a light: "He could always hit .360 
like I did last spring and win a job here, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Jr. shakes his head. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand, Benito is a great catcher, he is the Padres' catcher, it is the 
way it should be," he said. "And I know that while I am young, I cannot back 
up, Mark Parent is the best backup. There is no place for me here." 
</P>
<P>
Such is the truth of this statement that even the tough Santiago feels sorry 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy, I do all I can to help him," Santiago said. "He's in a tough spot, 
and I know about that tough spot. We talk, I help him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Alomar: "There is no bad feelings with Benito, because I know I have to 
go. But where? I wish they would tell me. I wish I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
True to his character, part of the reason Alomar wants to be traded soon is for 
reasons other than baseball, human reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I get to a city at the start of the season and make friends?" he 
asked. "The later it gets, the harder it is to be part of a club. I don't want 
to be an outsider somewhere all year." 
</P>
<P>
Alomar finds it funny that so many people ask him for his preference of cities 
-- "They don't know . . . I would go to Japan." 
</P>
<P>
He does, however, know where he doesn't want to go: back to triple-A Las Vegas. 
But if McKeon can't work something out, that is precisely where he is headed. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, you gotta go, you gotta go," McKeon said. "I remember back in the days of 
the great Baltimore Orioles, a lot of guys went back to the minors after great 
years because you don't replace a Brooks Robinson or Jim Palmer. I saw Scott 
McGregor, Mike Flanagan, Doug DeCinces, Don Baylor all go back to the minors." 
</P>
<P>
"What can I do there?" Alomar asked. "I haven't thought about it yet, and I 
don't want to think about it. I love the people and the town, but why stay in 
the same place? 
</P>
<P>
"None of this is the Padres' fault, but all the time, I'm the one getting 
penalized. That's what's hard." 
</P>
<P>
Other things are also hard. Like Tuesday morning, when Alomar couldn't find his 
baseball shoes. Turns out an equipment man accidently gave them to Benito 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
"Funny, huh?" asked Alomar, without one drop or splash of a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Four of the eight remaining no-shows reported to camp Tuesday, one day before 
the requested date. Outfielder Marvell Wynne, shortstop and captain Garry 
Templeton, first baseman Rob Nelson and utility man Bip Roberts all worked out. 
The only position players who did not report early, and will make their first 
on-field appearance in today's first full workout, are first baseman Jack 
Clark, infielders Randy Ready and Gary Green and outfielder Shane Mack. Pitcher 
Eric Show, who has been home with the flu, is also expected to make his first 
appearance today. three days late. . . . Negotiations have begun for the Padres 
final three unsigned players, Benito Santiago, Roberto Alomar, and Sandy Alomar 
Jr., all represented by agent Scott Boras. Although Santiago actually walked 
out of camp for a morning last season during sometimes heated contract talks, 
he said this year will be different: "I'm not saying the stuff I said last 
year, I'm not saying anything," Santiago said. "There is too much good that can 
happen on the field for me to worry about the contract. I'm sure I will be 
happy." He will be particularly happy if his $177,000 deal of last year is 
increased to around $300,000. Said Boras: "I want Benito focused on the goal of 
having a fine year, focused on the game rather than the contract. It's a 
situation where I will keep as low key as possible." Santiago just recently 
signed with Boras after dropping Davimos Sports Inc. following last year's 
unpleasantness. Roberto Alomar, meanwhile, will try to push his major-league 
minimum of $62,500 into the $150,000 range, while brother Sandy Jr., with just 
one big league at-bat, will sign for considerably less.

<P>
The New Orleans men's basketball team hadn't defeated a ranked team in 14 years 
of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I competition. 
</P>
<P>
That changed Tuesday night, however, with an 83-77 victory over struggling 
12th-ranked Florida State at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hokett made three three-point shots in the final eight minutes and Tony 
Harris made four free throws in the final 40 seconds as New Orleans handed 
Florida State (19-5) its third consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans (16-9) took a 60-55 lead on Hokett's first three-pointer, but 
Florida State tied the score, 62-62, on Aubry Boyd's two free throws with 5:41 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Hokett made his second three-point basket with 5:30 left. Florida State tied 
the score, 67-67, on Derrick Mitchell's free throws with 3:43 left. Hokett then 
made his third three-pointer, giving New Orleans the lead for good, 70-67, with 
3:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 109, Nevada-Reno 86 -- Kevin Madden scored 21 points and J.R.

consecutive victory in the nonconference game at Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Reno (14-10) took a 12-3 lead three minutes into the game, but North 
Carolina tied the score, 17-17, and took the lead for good when Fox, who scored 
15 points in the first half, made two free throws with 13:04 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall 63, St. John's 60 -- John Morton scored all 22 of his points in the

tie as No. 15 Seton Hall won the Big East Conference game at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Jayson Williams scored 25 points for St. John's (14-10, 5-8).

MORNING BRIEFING: HE HARDLY RATES AS A FOUNTAIN OF BASEBALL INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven months after picking up a baseball for the first time, former cricketer 
Julien Fountain of Bognor Regis, England, is heading for tryout camps in 
Florida armed with Britain's best curve and a hunger to learn the American 
pastime. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain, a right-hander whose fastball has been timed at 65 m.p.h. on a rusty 
radar gun, will pay his own way to tryouts with the Kansas City Royals, the 
Chicago White Sox, the Dodgers and possibly the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8, 154-pounder is confident about his athletic ability but a little 
concerned with his baseball knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I took to it like a duck to water," he said. "I had a strong arm, but 
obviously it was very erratic. The hardest thing was trying to keep it dead 
straight." 
</P>
<P>
The batters in America will no doubt keep that in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm chucking myself in at the really deep end with these tryouts," he said. 
"I'm scared they are going to put me in a tactical situation. I can do the 
physical stuff, it's the situations that are the problems." 
</P>
<P>
Chucking himself in at the really deep end? 
</P>
<P>
Someone has to introduce this guy to Yogi Berra. 
</P>
<P>
Add Fountain: At the same time he was learning how to slide and tag up, he 
injured his pitching arm and was unable to throw at full speed. 
</P>
<P>
"My curveball suddenly came in June when I ripped all the ligaments in my 
shoulder," Fountain said. "I was having physiotherapy and taking tons of 
painkillers. I must have been hallucinating, because the curveball was just 
moving like anything." 
</P>
<P>
When the New York Yankees pulled an about-face and signed Ron Guidry to a 
one-year contract after snubbing him all winter, the reason was clear. 
Perfectly clear. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my decision," owner George Steinbrenner said. 
</P>
<P>
Was it hard to get new Manager Dallas Green to agree? 
</P>
<P>
"Not at all," Steinbrenner said. "I just told him." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Hastings of the Miami Heat was walking through the Milwaukee airport 
recently when a man stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
"He saw me standing next to a few of my teammates and asked, 'Who are you guys 
with?' " Hastings recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'We're with the Miami Heat.' 
</P>
<P>
"And he said, 'Oh, you must be in town to play Marquette.' "

Bernard King scored 33 points and Jeff Malone had 27 Tuesday night as the 
Washington Bullets handed the Clippers' their sixth straight defeat, 123-109. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Clippers' 25th in their last 26 games. They have now lost 35 
straight in Eastern Conference cities. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second straight for the Bullets, who defeated the Clippers 
at Los Angeles Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who have not won at the Capital Centre since December 1979, led 
by as many as 11 points in the first half. But after the Clippers opened a 
44-33 lead early in the second quarter, the Bullets put together a 20-8 run to 
go in front, 53-52, as Jeff Malone, Steve Colter and Harvey Grant each scored 
six points. The game was tied at 66 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets took an 87-76 lead with 5:40 left in the third period, and were in 
front, 98-87, going into the final quarter. King and Malone scored the first 16 
Washington points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who got no closer than eight points in the final period, were led 
by Ken Norman's 24 points and 13 rebounds. Benoit Benjamin had 21 points, 
Reggie Williams 15 and Gary Grant 14. 
</P>
<P>
John Williams added 20 points for the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost our composure and intensity," Williams said. "They had too many open 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets shot 57.3% from the field, led by Malone's 11 for 13. The only shot 
Malone missed in the first half was a heave from halfcourt at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to come back out and fire it up," said Malone, who caught an elbow in 
the mouth early in the first quarter and had to go to the locker room for 
examination. "I was able to get my shots where I wanted them tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets shot well all night, but the Clippers cooled off quickly after 
shooting 67% in the first half and made only 30 of 70 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a pretty good job of getting the shots they wanted in the first half, 
but we picked up the defense in the second half," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense was clicking all night, but we weren't doing anything on defense. 
In the second half, we put some pressure on defensively and took over the 
ballgame," Malone said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're not a fourth-quarter team, said Clipper Coach Don Casey. "Our 
shooting was great in the first half, but the defense dropped off in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Malone and King "were the difference," Casey said. "We didn't defense them as 
well tonight as we did in L.A. Their experience was the difference tonight."

Chuck Muncie, former star running back of the Chargers, was sentenced Tuesday 
to 2 1/2 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to a felony drug charge 
and lying to a judge about using cocaine while free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way you're going to get the message in this case is if you go to 
jail," U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving told Muncie in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Irving imposed the sentence on Muncie, who now admits cocaine addiction, even 
though his attorney, Cindy Aaron, submitted eight letters supporting Muncie's 
plea to be released in order to undergo intensive drug rehabilitation, 
including ones from former Charger Coach Don Coryell and Charger team physician 
E. Lee Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Muncie also offered apologies to the court and said "I'm more than willing to 
get my life back in order." 
</P>
<P>
Muncie's sentence caps years of legal troubles for the former star whose career 
was cut short by drug use.

SOCKERS RETRIEVE HIRMEZ, SEND GARCIA TO LAZERS

Waad Hirmez, the high scorer in last season's Major Indoor Soccer League 
playoffs while helping the Sockers to their sixth indoor championship, returned 
to the Sockers from the Los Angeles Lazers Tuesday in a trade for forward Poli 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez, who joined the Lazers as a free agent last summer, has scored 11 goals 
and nine assists in 30 games for Los Angeles this season. Garcia, who played 
for the Lazers from 1982 to 1987 and scored 50 goals for the St. Louis Steamers 
last season, had played only sparingly for the Sockers this season and scored 
just one goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ecstatic about this," Sockers' Coach Ron Newman said. "We had an 
abundance of offensive talent here, and Poli just couldn't find much playing 
time. We needed help in the midfield, and we already know that Waady can 
provide that for us." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez, who went to Point Loma High School, started his career with the Sockers 
as a defender in 1984. He moved to the midfield midway through last season and 
scored a career-high 30 goals. In the playoffs, he scored 15 goals and had nine 
assists, including a hat trick in the Sockers' MISL championship-clinching 7-4 
victory over the Cleveland Force. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be any happier about this," Hirmez said. "Things just didn't work out 
for me in Los Angeles, and I'm happy to be coming back to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez will return to the lineup in time to play against the Lazers in Los 
Angeles Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Ron Newman said the Sockers are still somewhat interested in re-acquiring 
goalkeeper Jim Gorsek from the Lazers, but talks are on hold. "There's been 
some preliminary talks, but that's it," Newman said. "We're unsure whether or 
not we need a third goalkeeper because we don't know about the status (of 
Zoltan Toth, who's been out for more than a month with bunions). But they (the 
Lazers) have three goalkeepers, so they could be looking to move one of the 
them." . . . Amid rumors that it might be looking for a new commissioner, the 
MISL announced that Bill Kentling has until March 15 to decide whether or not 
he wants to return for the 1989-90 season. Kentling, speaking after Tuesday's 
MISL owner meetings in Dallas, said he hasn't started thinking about what he 
wants to do. But owners have already put together a committee, headed by Stuart 
Weitzman, the Baltimore Blast's managing general partner, to begin looking for 
a new commissioner in the event Kentling doesn't come back.

SDSU GETS BREAK FROM WAC, PLAYS FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL

<P>
The San Diego State men's basketball team, new occupant of last place in the 
Western Athletic Conference, gets a respite from league play tonight at 7:30 
when Florida International visits the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The WAC break couldn't have come at a better time for Coach Jim Brandenburg's 
team. SDSU (10-14, 4-10) has lost 10 of its past 12 WAC games and 24 of 25 
conference road games, including eight in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a break from the WAC is good for us right now," Brandenburg said. "It 
will be ood for us to be back home again and see if we can't get on the winning 
track and gain some momentum." 
</P>
<P>
A season that was so promising as recently as early January, when the Aztecs 
won their first two WAC games, has turned sour. The Aztecs have outrebounded 
opponents in 19 of 24 games but have more turnovers in WAC play (210) than 
opponents (180) and a poorer free throw shooting percentage (63% to 71%). 
</P>
<P>
One of the few bright spots has been the play of Shawn Bell. The 6-foot-6 
forward led the team in Saturday's 71-67 loss at Wyoming with 16 points, nine 
rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
Florida International's best all-around player is 6-7 forward Dwight Stewart, 
who is averaging 16.7 points and 6.2 rebounds. Doug Johnson leads Florida 
International in scoring with a 17.4-point average. 
</P>

LEMIEUX'S SLUMP COSTS PENGUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Mario Lemieux's chances of breaking Wayne Gretzky's scoring records become 
more remote, the struggles of the Pittsburgh Penguins increase. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux had only an assist Tuesday night at Pittsburgh and the Minnesota North 
Stars ended a four-game losing streak, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would have put the Penguins back in first place in the Patrick 
Division, which is having a sensational race. Instead, Wally Schreiber's goal 
halfway through the last period, handed them their third consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux's only point was a fluke. Early in the second period, from behind the 
net, Lemieux's pass went in front to Jock Callander. Callander's shot caromed 
off Minnesota defenseman Curt Giles into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The fluke score gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead. The good luck of the Penguins 
turned sour halfway through the period. Ville Siren of the Stars took a shot 
from the point, it hit a Pittsburgh stick, bounced off the stick of Minnesota's 
Dino Ciccarelli and went into the net for Ciccarelli's 31st goal and a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Schreiber's goal was no fluke. He directed, with his stick, a shot from the 
point into the net past goalie Tom Barrasso. It was only his second in 18 
games. 
</P>
<P>
With 20 games left, Lemieux needs 30 goals and 59 points to tie Gretzky's 
records. Three weeks ago, Lemieux was on a pace that would have wiped both 
records out. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux usually gets a number of goals and assists on power plays. He is the 
main reason the Penguins have more goals with a player advantage than anyone 
else. Against goalie Kari Takko, the Penguins had five power-play opportunities 
and didn't convert one. Takko had 37 saves, at least seven when his team was 
short-handed.

<P>
Vancouver 2, St. Louis 0 -- The impressive goaltending of Kirk McLean continued 
at Vancouver and the Canucks set a club record with their sixth victory in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
McLean, in winning his fifth consecutive game, recorded his second shutout and 
improved his record to 15-11-4. 
</P>
<P>
Defensemen Larry Melnyk and Doug Lidster scored first-period goals and the rest 
of the night the defense prevented the Blues from getting good shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
The winning streak has put the Canucks nine points ahead of Winnipeg in the 
battle for the last playoff spot in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, New York Islanders 5 -- If the Red Wings do hang on and win the 
Norris Division, it will be largely because Steve Yzerman is having a banner 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Yzerman scored two goals and assisted on another at Uniondale, N.Y., to lead 
the Wings to a hard-earned victory that extended their lead to 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
The goals gave Yzerman 55. He is tied with John Ogrodnick for the club record 
in a season. He has 123 points, breaking Marcel Dionne's record of 121 set in 
the 1974-75 season. With 28 games left, Yzerman is certain to extend the 
records considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Michel Goulet and Marc Fortier scored goals six minutes 
apart in the second period at Quebec to bring the Nordiques from behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets had won two in a row by coming from behind in the last period, but 
this time, they couldn't get the puck past goalie Ron Tugnutt in the final 33 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 7, Hartford 4 -- Mark Messier scored four goals at Edmonton as the 
Oilers ended a three-game losing streak. The victory enabled the Oilers to pull 
within three points of the Kings in the battle for second in the Smythe 
Division. DAN HAFNER

TRAVELING CALL: HILL TAKES STEPS TO SEE SON PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about dedication. George Hill has not missed a Cleveland High basketball 
game this season. 
</P>
<P>
That's not surprising. Hill's son Eddie is a junior guard averaging 12 points a 
game for Cleveland. And the Cavaliers are a victory away from the City Section 
4-A Division semifinals as they play host to Fairfax today in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
George Hill, however, currently in South Carolina on business, will go to great 
lengths to keep the streak alive. He is scheduled to fly into town just in time 
for tonight's 7:30 tip-off. Hill is then scheduled to return to South Carolina 
on a midnight flight. 
</P>
<P>
Should Cleveland defeat Fairfax, Hill intends to fly to L. A. for Friday 
night's game at the Sports Arena, then once again catch the red-eye across 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hill, simply: "I gotta see my boy play."

PS Group reported a $1.7-million net loss for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 
1988, contrasted with a $5.8-million net profit during the previous fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the quarter fell to $47.5 million, down from $92.9 million during 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group benefitted from a $2.7-million pretax gain on the sale of one leased 
MD-80 aircraft during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
However, that gain was offset by "increased losses from the travel distribution 
business and reduced contribution from the fuel distribution business," 
according to the company. 
</P>
<P>
PS Group reported a $44-million net profit for the year, down from a 
$55.6-million net profit during 1987. Revenue for the year fell to $216 
million, down from $338 million during 1987. Net income for 1988 resulted from 
a gain recorded in connection with the termination of excess assets in PS 
Group's pension plan.

PEOPLE: STATE BANKING CHIEF TAKES POST AT SECURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Gould will leave his post as superintendent of the State Banking 
Department next month to become head of the Los Angeles office of the Secura 
Group, a bank consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Gould, 39, has headed the state regulatory agency for the past two years. 
Before that, he spent three years as one of Gov. George Deukmejian's top aides 
on financial services regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The State Banking Department regulates and examines the 271 state-chartered 
banks in California. State-chartered banks tend to be smaller, community banks, 
although some are large, including First Interstate Bank of California. 
</P>
<P>
The Secura Group, which has its headquarters in Washington, was founded by 
former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman William M. Isaac. Along with 
bank consulting, the firm has assisted in arranging many recent mergers in the 
banking and savings and loan industries. 
</P>
<P>
Gould said in an interview Tuesday that he will become a partner and head of 
the firm's existing four-person office in Los Angeles. He said he expects to 
concentrate on bank consulting, and bank merger and acquisition activity. 
</P>
<P>
Merger activity among California banks has been active recently as the state 
prepares for the introduction of interstate banking in 1991. That means that 
banks from outside the West will be able to compete fully here for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 15 bank mergers in California, nearly double 1987's total 
of eight and well above the four mergers in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the troubles in the savings and loan industry and possible effects 
of reform efforts mean that increased mergers and acquisitions are likely 
there, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not waiting until '91," said Gould. "What I will be looking at is 
helping banks and thrifts take advantage of marketplace opportunities that 
exist today." 
</P>
<P>
As superintendent of banks, Gould has been credited with modernizing the office 
through the introduction of more extensive use of computers and more 
sophisticated methods of monitoring the financial health of banks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to establishing a training program for bank examiners, Gould set up 
the department's first unit for providing an ongoing analysis of bank financial 
data to supplement periodic examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Gould said he is optimistic about the health of California's state-chartered 
banks. He said no state bank failed last year after five failures in 1987. He 
said the number of institutions classified by regulators as "problem banks," 
meaning that they require extra scrutiny, declined last year to 27, compared to 
a high of 47 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Gould, who spent five years with Wells Fargo Bank before joining state 
government, said he and his family will move from the San Francisco Bay Area to 
Glendora in the San Gabriel Valley. DOUGLAS FRANTZ

PEOPLE: AMI PRESIDENT RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene E. Burleson has resigned from the posts of president and chief operating 
officer at American Medical International, positions eliminated as part of a 
management reorganization engineered by the company's new chairman, Richard 
Gilleland. 
</P>
<P>
Gilleland, installed as chairman and chief executive of the Beverly Hills-based 
hospital chain in January, will assume Burleson's duties. Gilleland said the 
position was no longer necessary because he will now work directly with the 
managers who had been reporting to Burleson. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Burleson's departure is part of a management restructuring designed to 
streamline AMI's executive ranks and eliminate redundant positions," Gilleland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Burleson was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Burleson, 48, was named chief operating officer of AMI in June, 1986, and 
selected president in January, 1988. He served as chief executive and managing 
director of the company's United Kingdom operations from 1981 to 1986. GEORGE

Deere &amp; Co.'s first-quarter earnings fell 28% from last year to $48 
million. Sales totaled $1.14 billion, up 9%. The Moline, Ill.-based 
agricultural and lawn equipment maker attributed the results primarily to 
extraordinary gains a year ago as well as the start-up of a new line of 
combines, large tractors and other equipment, which resulted in some production 
and shipping delays and added costs.

JACK SMITH: LET EVERYBODY INTRODUCE THEIR OWN SELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My conclusion that "everybody . . . their" has become standard English is not 
universally embraced. 
</P>
<P>
Almost everyone seems to object to this usage, though it is prevalent today 
among literate people and can be found in cultivated written English as far 
back as the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Like several others, Irving R. Tannenbaum, professor of chemistry at West Los 
Angeles College, wonders why we can't simply recast our sentences, as in "All 
should put their hats on," instead of "Everybody should put their hats on." 
</P>
<P>
That certainly is the easy and grammatical way out, but speech habits die hard; 
I doubt that everyone will think to say "all" instead of everyone or everybody. 
We don't think that far ahead when we talk; we use old patterns. 
</P>
<P>
David P. Lewis of Sherman Oaks suggests various solutions. "Any grammarian 
worthy of the title would say, 'Will you all put on your hats?' or 'Let's all 
put on our hats' or 'Put on your hats, please.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lewis protests that my examples from 16th and 19th-Century English writers are 
irrelevant today "except as footnotes to the evolution of English." 
</P>
<P>
He says: "You may argue that when someone says that ('Will everyone put on 
their hats') we know what they (!) mean, but one might also posit that when I 
say 'I ain't got no money,' everybody knows what I mean. How far do we go with 
this?" 
</P>
<P>
By inserting that exclamation point after his "someone . . . they," Mr. Lewis 
indicates that he is aware of his solecism, and is only kidding. But his only 
acceptable alternative would have been the awkward he or she. 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Tappan of Cambria says he is confused by the headline over my column: 
"Everybody Are Not Happy With This." He asks: "Did it mean 'Nobody are happy 
with this'? or 'Not everybody are happy with this'? or don't it make any 
difference?" 
</P>
<P>
I think the headline was quite clear, but of course everybody is entitled to 
their own interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
Ward B. Lewis of Rancho Mirage protests my suggestion that everybody might be 
treated as a collective, like the British team, corporation and government, and 
given a plural verb and pronoun. He insists that crowd, company and corporation 
are not plural nouns, but singular. "To me," he says, "the most objectionable 
is the opening sentence on 'Masterpiece Theatre' on public television where 
Mobil Corporation invites you to join them. This is repeated weekly year after 
year." 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, I always think of a crowd, a company or a corporation as being 
composed of many persons, and think the pronouns we, they or them quite 
suitable. While we do not say that "the Bush Administration are," we usually 
refer to it in the next sentence as they, not it. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Putt notes that the feminist movement has caused some peculiar 
manifestations of distorted English, though, as I said, it is not responsible 
for "everybody . . . their." She writes: "Some years back we stopped for lunch 
at a Howard Johnson's in Santa Maria. On the table was a folded, triangular 
questionnaire, similar to the ones on your hotel dresser. One of the questions 
was: 'Did your waitperson introduce themself by name?' " 
</P>
<P>
That's truly lovely. 
</P>
<P>
The only perhaps more enchanting example of a stillborn pronoun I have seen 
lately was one that book editor Jack Miles found, incredibly, in the Talk of 
the Town section of the New Yorker, a magazine long admired for its impeccable 
grammar. The Talk of the Town has always affected the editorial we even when 
obviously describing the adventures of one reporter. This sometimes difficult 
device resulted in this astonishing concoction: "We ourself . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Is nothing sacred anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Everett J. Daniels challenges my citing of Ronald Reagan's use of "everybody . 
. . their" as evidence that it has become standard. "When I was a kid I used to 
hear about using the King's English; nobody ever mentioned the President's 
English." 
</P>
<P>
John McKiernan of Culver City says we must learn to use grammatical ways of 
avoiding "everybody . . . their," such as "All of your questions will be 
answered." He points out: "It is always possible to work around this supposed 
'flaw' in the language without awkward forms or more awkward neologisms. You 
just have to care enough to try. But as usual everybody will do as they damn 
well please. They always do." 
</P>
<P>
Ain't that the truth?

ALICE KAHN: AWED BY UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF THE AWARD-CEREMONY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that we're knee-deep into the awards-ceremony season, I'd like to tell the 
stars what I see in the stars: I see public humiliation in your future. 
</P>
<P>
I am referring to you, the stars of television, movies, records and all allied 
rights pertaining to the work, including without limitation remake, 
videocassette, videodisc and commercial tie-ups. As the lawyers say, "You need 
language." 
</P>
<P>
I mean, here it is your shot at the megabigtime, and you stand up there before 
millions of potential consumers mumbling about your moms and dads and your 
manager Swifty Bernstein. How dare those high-paid agents and personal managers 
and exercise trainers let you get up there to make a fool of yourself? They 
wouldn't think of allowing you to dress like a moron. Unless you're Cher. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of some performers is sealed at these events. Think of poor Sally 
Field heading toward a tombstone marked: "To Know Me Was to Like Me." Or 
Sasheen Littlefeather forever schlepping around that portfolio distinguished 
only by: "Stood in for Brando at Academy Awards." 
</P>
<P>
I know about these things because I am a hard-core awards ceremony watcher. I 
haven't missed an event -- not the Tonys, the Oscars, the Grammys or the Bozos. 
The Bozos are given out for such lesser-known achievements as Best Performance 
by a White Singer in a Category Once Created for Blacks. I can't explain why I 
watch these shows because they are almost always dreadful. My daughter reminds 
me that each year, as the Academy Awards ceremony ends, I say, "That was the 
worst one yet." 
</P>
<P>
Awards shows generally leave you with the impression that without scripts, 
directors and coaches, your average great star is a complete bust. It's like 
the emperor's new clothes -- the star is naked except for an $8,000 gown. 
</P>
<P>
The one bright light is that the public will be devoted forever to anyone who 
manages to liven these things up. Robin Williams may not actually be that 
funny, but his award-show blitzes are among the greatest moments in television. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, when I watched the American Music Awards, I was struck by the young 
stars' thank-yous. The standard speech seemed to be, "I'd like to thank God, my 
manager Buddy Goldfinger and Barry Goldwink of S&amp;M Records." 
</P>
<P>
Someone needs to counsel these people about the separation between God and 
capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
I understand that stars, in their arrogance, assume it's important to appear 
modest and surprised at these events. We have all marveled at the award-winning 
displays of awe a favored contender can show at such moments. Take the multiple 
winner, who begins with "I can't believe it." In his next appearance, we get 
the ever-popular "This is just the icing on the cake." By the third award, the 
speech is a curt "I'm really grateful; now get my car." 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I have always enjoyed the political speeches that people make at 
these events because it enlivens the drama in what is usually a deadening 
display of industry inarticulateness. If you can't be funny, you can at least 
believe in something. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to thank the board for honoring me with this award, but as long as 
there is one person lying in the gutter in front of my limo, I can't really 
party. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The other thing I always appreciate is complete sincerity. I keep waiting for 
the performer who has the guts to tell it like it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to thank my mom and dad for making me the neurotic, driven person I 
am. I'd like to thank my ex-spouses for getting out before I had to share any 
of this glory with them. I'd like to thank my current spouse for putting up 
with me, but I never really get the devotion I deserve. I'd like to thank my 
manager, but I think he is a money-grubbing dog. I'd like to thank my agent, 
but it was my work and not his mouth that got me the gig. I'd like to thank 
God, but I'll wait and see how much this is ultimately worth." 
</P>
<P>
Now, that would surely be the Best Performance by an Egomaniac in a Humble 
Role.

EIGHT-FILM OFFERING AT UCLA FINLAND'S KAURISMAKI BROTHERS 
</P>

The UCLA Film and Television Archive is presenting eight films from Finland's 
Kaurismaki brothers from Thursday through March 11 at Melnitz Theater. If the 
first two films, Mika Kaurismaki's "Rosso" (1985) and Aki Kaurismaki's "Crime 
and Punishment" (1983), are any indication, we're in for a treat. 
</P>
<P>
"Rosso" is a knockout, pure and simple, and was a record-setter at Finnish box 
offices. A Sicilian hit man, Giancarlo Rossi (Kari Vaananen, a top Finnish star 
who speaks Italian throughout), is ordered to go to Finland to assassinate a 
Finnish woman whom he soon realizes is the beauty who had been his summer 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
(We don't know why there's a contract out on her, and Rosso doesn't either.) 
</P>
<P>
From this romantic premise, Mika Kaurismaki spins an ironic and unpredictable 
fable of destiny in the form of a road movie that's more Wim Wenders than 
Hollywood. It develops with a sly sense of the absurd that recalls Eastern 
European comedy at its darkest, a quality underlined by flourishes of a 
small-town brass band. The film also recalls Werner Schroeter's "Palermo or 
Wolfsburg" in its depiction of a Sicilian adrift in a society as cold as its 
climate. 
</P>
<P>
Aki Kaurismaki's "Crime and Punishment," which marked a notably ambitious and 
successful directorial debut, is as free an adaptation of Doestoevsky as it is 
inspired. It's a far more somber film than "Rosso," but it builds considerable 
low-key power and is imbued with the same sense of existentialist fatalism as 
"Rosso." 
</P>
<P>
A lean, sullen young man with thinning long hair (Markku Toika), once a law 
student, now a Helsinki slaughterhouse worker, shoots down a middle-aged man in 
his elegant apartment. His motive is different from that of Raskolnikov, and 
there is also a witness, a young woman who finds herself unable to give him 
away to the police. Intact from the original is the cat-and-mouse skirmishing 
between a police inspector who hasn't enough evidence to nail the killer, who 
in turn baits him, but Aki Kaurismaki develops his own concerns in his own 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Kaurismakis are film makers with a keen sense of discovery, and in 
their respective films, we're left feeling that we've been taken on a shrewdly 
observed, thoroughly detailed journey into the unpredictable territory of the 
human heart and life itself.

Jesse Jackson made an appeal Monday for the "earliest possible" parole of soul 
singer James Brown, saying Brown had been a model prisoner and an inspiration 
to others. Jackson, who met with Brown for more than 90 minutes at the State 
Park Correctional Institute near Columbia, S.C., told USA Today that Brown's 
punishment seemed excessive, but added, "It's not the time to make a judgment 
on the judge, it's a time to appeal for mercy." Brown is entering his third 
month in prison for a six-year sentence stemming from a two-state, high-speed 
police chase last September. Shauna Snow

Without "Lonesome Dove" or its equivalent to distract them, viewers returned to 
their normal TV habits last week. NBC trounced the competition, led as usual by 
"The Cosby Show." Ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. placed NBC's average 
prime-time audience last week at 14.6 million homes, compared to 11.8 million 
for CBS and 11 million for ABC. The full list of Nielsen ratings is on Page 12. 
</P>
<P>
* Sealing ABC's fate as No. 3 for the week was the poor performance Sunday 
night of the first half of its murder mystery "Passion and Paradise." It ran 
third from 9-11 p.m., attracting viewers in about 10.7 million homes, compared 
to 15.6 million for NBC's TV movie "Swimsuit" and 14.9 million for CBS' TV 
movie "The Fulfillment of Mary Gray."

VEGAS GLOSS BURIES NEW DIRECTION FOR JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though it's a point easily forgotten after Tom Jones' two decades of Las Vegas 
gloss and grind, his big Welsh baritone once earned the awe of American soul 
singers, the Beatles and other '60s contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
From almost the day in 1965 that he first hit with "It's Not Unusual," however, 
Jones has squandered his vocal gift on hack-work songs while developing a 
pandering sex-god stage act that made him a joke to most neutral observers. 
</P>
<P>
His 16-song set Sunday at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre opened with portents of 
change: Jones' pit band introduced him by playing a reasonably funky version of 
the Talking Heads' "Mr. Jones," and Mr. Jones himself -- sporting the black 
long-coat from his recent "Kiss" video -- performed his "Help Yourself" with 
nary a bump nor grind. 
</P>
<P>
But, as the singer announced, "this was just foreplay," and he soon trotted out 
his old moves for the remainder of the show -- a parade of such familiar tunes 
as "Green, Green Grass of Home," "Delilah," "With These Hands" and "What's New, 
Pussycat?" Jones' voice has lost none of its power and range, but, with his 
schmaltzy material, it was like using a giant redwood to make paper pulp for a 
tabloid. 
</P>
<P>
Two new tunes were airy, synth-pop ballads, but a third, by Irish songwriter 
Chris DeBurgh, hinted at what Jones might achieve with better material. Singing 
the words of a father who fears the world he has brought his daughter into, 
Jones exhibited a sense of drama and emotion that broke through the mere 
professional sheen he brought to the rest of the performance.JIM WASHBURN

'SADHANA' STUMBLES EN ROUTE TO THE HIMALAYAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the documentary -- or docu-drama -- "Sadhana" (which opens today for four 
days at the Nuart), a slim, trimly ascetic Quebecois named Marcel wanders off 
to the Ganges, the Himalayas and Haridwar with a series of gurus who keep 
lecturing him on finding the self. The road to the truth, we are often 
reminded, is hard and cold, strewn with ashes. Unfortunately, this movie, 
wafting along on its rosy carpet of New Age flutes and synthesizers (scored by 
Jean-Pierre Labreche), seems to be taking a few shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
In letters home, Marcel talks about the path he has chosen, about the masters 
to whom he must submit, the comforts he must eschew, the power and the fullness 
that he senses is around here somewhere in India and into which he wants to 
dissolve himself -- like a sugar lump in hot tea? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he is taken by his ash-covered adviser for a dip in the river during 
the Kumbh Mela, a mass holy ceremony that takes place every 12 years and 
coincides here with the arrival of Halley's Comet. 
</P>
<P>
All this is touching. The various spiritual advisers dispense wisdom cheerily, 
mostly in English, though they tend to repeat the same thing endlessly. But 
questions persist. Who is Marcel? Why is he being followed everywhere by a 
camera and sound crew? Are these events actual or restaged? 
</P>
<P>
In the press book, Marcel is identified as Marcel Poulin -- also the film's 
co-writer-director with Jean-Pierre Piche -- a Quebec restaurateur. Did Poulin 
give away his restaurant to follow the path? 
</P>
<P>
But maybe we're being crass, unspiritual, Old Age. Poulin and Piche wanted to 
make a film about the Kumbh Mela and their sponsors nudged them into 
"personalizing" the film. Hence the dreamy Marcel, the phony dramatic 
structure, the wistful narration. After all, to paraphrase "Sadhana" 
(Times-rated: Family), the road to cinema is hard and cold, strewn with ashes. 
To find the self, we must bury the self, then catch it with a camera and tape 
recorder. And repeat ourselves. Endlessly. 
</P>

HORTA CREATES DIN AT LE CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the heart and soul of the Brazilian guitarist Toninho Horta one suspects 
there is great musicality lurking. But he made it very difficult to discover 
Monday night at the Room Upstairs at Le Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting more than an hour for his first set to even begin, Horta 
proceeded to make the full house wait even longer for anything of musical 
significance as he led his sextet through a series of tunes that could best be 
described as deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the Room Upstairs is far better suited for softer acts, but Horta, who 
has recently been featured with singer Flora Purim, and his fellow players 
should know how to make such adjustments (leaving half of the amplifiers at 
home would have been a good start). It was a sad mistake that short-changed an 
enthusiastic audience as the rich textural qualities, rhythmic excitement and 
subtle flavorings of much of Horta's music were exchanged for a muddled din of 
monotonous excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Horta has fueled the Brazilian compositional traditions with electricity, 
creating an unattractive fusion like one that might occur if Jobim ever sat in 
with Spryo Gyra. And from the few established fusion traditions, Horta has 
borrowed such elements as unison melody statements, odd-metered transitions and 
riff-based improvisations. It was the samba that couldn't dance, the bossa 
without the nova. 
</P>
<P>
Contributing to all of this nonsense was the ever-dashing drummer Mike Shapiro 
and the booming bassist Gary Brown, both of whom seemed eager to be heard in 
Riverside without ever having to leave Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
All of Monday evening's interminable first set wasn't lost, however. Like the 
momentary aural refreshment offered when the subway finally stops, came a 
handful of beautiful ballads to offer pleasant respite. Horta's guitar playing 
took on new dimensions -- ones of grace and simplicity -- and his vocal on 
"Waiting for Angela" revealed a sensitive vocal stylist. A. JAMES LISKA

MANAGER DENIES MILES DAVIS AIDS REPORT; INSTRUMENTS DONATED TO LOCKE HIGH 
SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Contrary to a story which appeared in the Feb. 21 issue of the supermarket 
tabloid, the Star, trumpeter Miles Davis does not have AIDS, said Davis' 
manager, Peter Shukat, on Tuesday. "It's totally unfounded, totally untrue," 
Shukat said of the Star story. Shukat, who issued a press release denying the 
story, said the 62-year-old Davis had recently been in the hospital, battling a 
mild case of pneumonia and having a benign polyp removed from his vocal cords. 
"He's now resting comfortably at his Southland home," Shukat said, "and is in 
excellent shape for a man his age." Davis is expected to begin his 1989 world 
tour April. 
</P>
<P>
Young student musicians are invited to apply for the sixth annual Dolo Coker 
jazz scholarship, given in memory of the fine pianist who was an integral part 
of the Los Angeles jazz scene for many years. 
</P>
<P>
Coker, who resided in the Southland from the late '50s until his death in 1983, 
recorded several LPs as a leader and backed such greats as saxophonists Sonny 
Stitt, Dexter Gordon and Art Pepper, trumpeter Kenny Dorham and drummer Philly 
Joe Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship, which is awarded to full-time high school or college musicians 
-- ages 15-25 -- was created to both assist students seeking a career in jazz 
and to perpetuate the art form itself. The winners of this year's scholarships 
will perform at a benefit concert -- headlined by singer O.C. Smith, saxman 
Herman Riley and pianist Art Hillery -- for the Dolo Coker Scholarship 
Foundation, to be held at the Musicians' Union in April. Information: (213) 
666-3700. 
</P>
<P>
BASSIC GIVING: Blues composer-bassist Willie Dixon, whose classic songs such as 
"The Seventh Son" and "Spoonful" have been recorded by such jazzmen as Mose 
Allison and Gil Evans, is donating $3,000 worth of Yamaha musical instruments 
to Watts' Locke High School in memory of the late blues singer, Big Joe Turner. 
Dixon, a resident of Glendale, will make the donation -- which includes a 
matching grant from Yamaha Corp. -- through his Los Angeles-based Blues Heaven 
Foundation at a presentation at Locke on Thursday. To make sure the students 
have something to play the donated instruments on, Dixon is also giving the 
high school a stage band arrangement of his tune, "My Babe," scored by Lisa 
Webb, a graduate of North Texas State University. 
</P>
<P>
AROUND L.A.: The ebullient trumpeter Jack Sheldon's musical life used to be 
something like a lyric from the Dave Frishberg-Bob Dorough tune, "I'm Hip": "I 
was hep when it was hip to be hep." 
</P>
<P>
While a developing player here in the early-to-late '50s, native Floridian 
Sheldon -- though originally influenced by swing-era players -- emulated the 
then-in-vogue bop sounds of Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved Roy Eldridge, especially his version of 'Rockin' Chair,' with Gene 
Krupa's band," Sheldon, 58, said the other day. "Then I heard Bird and thought, 
'What is this?' It sounded really strange. But since I was supposed to like 
that kind of music, to be hip, I liked it. I did the whole thing, wore a beret, 
carried my trumpet in a leather bag. I was going with my peers." Sheldon's 
fiery bebop style can be heard on a number of LPs he made with the likes of 
altoist Art Pepper and bassist Curtis Counce. 
</P>
<P>
But when he joined the band on the Merv Griffin Show in 1960, Sheldon -- who 
appears in North Hollywood Tuesday and Wednesday at the Money Tree and Sundays 
at Alfonse's -- changed. "We started going to New York to play, and there they 
have more reverence for old guys, plus I got to hear Roy (Eldridge) and Ruby 
Braff play that older style, and I saw how good it was," he said. "So instead 
of trying to be hip, now I can really appreciate all these people." 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon's current performance finds him mixing searing trumpet work on the 
great standards with vocals and comedic banter. "I started doing comedy and 
singing when I was working with (singer) Julie London and (pianist) Bobby Troup 
in 1957-58," said Sheldon, whose latest LP is "Hollywood Heroes" (Concord 
Jazz). He says he gets the material from everyday existence. "My life is in 
utter chaos, so my stories about alcoholism, drug abuse, overeating and bad 
luck with women come from real true things," he said, only half kidding. 
Sheldon has been a recovering alcoholic for several years. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding a year ago he needed help, hornwise, Sheldon began studying trumpet 
with Uan Rasey, former first trumpeter at MGM Studios. "I had come up with my 
own way of playing, and he's teaching me to be a better player," he said. "Now 
I'm slowly getting better rather than slowly getting worse."

RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS: Billy Pierce's "Give and Take" (Sunnyside) finds the 
former Art Blakey tenor sax star fronting a quintet of talented young lions 
that includes pianist Mulgrew Miller and trumpeter Terrance Blanchard. Pierce, 
who's gradually shedding the Coltrane influence he's worn like a second skin, 
offers "Altered States" which races along at a gallop, "Farewell to Dogma," a 
sweet-then-edgy bossa where Blanchard and Miller deliver lucid, winsome 
statements, and "Aria's Dance," a full-of-juice unaccompanied romp.

POLICE END CLASH OF COMPTON GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police broke up a gang fight near Tragniew Park in Compton and arrested 40 
alleged gang members on charges including outstanding traffic warrants and four 
felony weapons offenses, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fight began Monday evening when about 10 members of one faction of the 
Crips gang entered the territory of a rival faction seeking retribution for the 
earlier beating of a gang member, Compton Police Lt. William Wallace said. They 
were met by about 30 members of the rival faction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the police arrived, several of the fighters ran to a nearby house, where 
police later recovered five guns and took many of the suspects into custody. 
Wallace said no shots were fired by the gang members or the police and there 
were no injuries.

U. S. Navy Capt. Alexander G. Balian testified Tuesday that he would have 
rescued a boatload of Vietnamese refugees his ship found adrift in the South 
China Sea if he had been correctly informed of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
His voice sometimes choking with emotion, the 48-year-old Balian told a Navy 
court-martial that, if he had known the desperate conditions aboard the 
Vietnamese craft, "there is no doubt in my mind I would tow them to my side and 
embark them. That's what I did on two previous occasions." 
</P>
<P>
Balian, a graduate of UCLA, is charged with dereliction of duty and failing to 
provide sufficient assistance to the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
His ship, the amphibious transport dock Dubuque, encountered the refugees' 
craft June 9, 1988, but Balian decided not to take them aboard. Thirty-one of 
the 110 refugees died, and survivors resorted to cannibalism before they were 
rescued by Filipino fishermen June 27 after 37 days at sea, U. N. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian testified that his crew gave the refugees 400 pounds of food and 55 
gallons of water and added, referring to the survivors: "If it wasn't for what 
we did, those people wouldn't be alive today. 
</P>
<P>
"I am being charged with giving insufficient assistance," he said. "What is 
sufficient?" he added, raising his voice. "If I assisted them forever and ever 
and ever and ever, would that be sufficient assistance?" 
</P>
<P>
When the Dubuque encountered the refugees' junk, Balian said, he ordered his 
executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley Halter, to determine if the craft was 
seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Halter, who went out in a launch to inspect the junk and reported to Balian by 
radio, told him the refugees said they did not need medical assistance and felt 
they could continue if given food and water, Balian testified. 
</P>
<P>
Based on poor interpreting, mistaken information and faulty communication, 
Balian said, he made the decision to leave the refugees behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my decision like any commanding officer had to," using the information 
at hand, Balian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we did a good job. In fact (the refugees) waved happily in thanks" 
after being given the food and water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said he later realized his crew had inadvertently given him incorrect 
information. 
</P>
<P>
He said Halter had told him the refugees said they had been at sea seven days 
when it was more like 19, according to later investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said Halter also said the refugees told him they had had no food and water 
for three days, although later investigation suggested it was more like a week. 
</P>
<P>
Halter also said the refugees reported they had no engine, although in fact 
they had a broken one. 
</P>
<P>
Balian also said he was unaware his executive officer had not placed any medics 
on board three boats sent out to check the conditions on the junk. 
</P>
<P>
He said he looked at the refugees through binoculars from the bridge of the 
Dubuque, at a distance of 240 to 600 feet, but could not see any naked refugees 
on board, nor the degree to which they were emaciated, as depicted in 
photographs taken with zoom lenses by his crew. 
</P>
<P>
Balian also denied allegations that he ordered crew members not to throw life 
rings to some of the Vietnamese who swam toward the ship. He said he did order 
an interpreter to tell swimmers to move away for fear they would be injured by 
the ship's propellers. 
</P>
<P>
Balian was relieved of command of the Dubuque in August, after the refugees 
reported the incident to U. N. officials in the Philippines.

AUTOPSY SHOWS 14 SHOTS HIT YOUTH; 
</P>
<P>
CORONER REPORTS ON SHOOTING DURING TUSSLE WITH ESCONDIDO POLICE OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Robert Scriven, killed by an Escondido police officer Jan. 2 
after the two struggled for the officer's handgun, was shot 14 times, according 
to an autopsy report released Tuesday by the county coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Escondido Police Department previously said the teen-ager had been shot at 
least 11 times, based on the number of bullets recovered during the autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chased by Officer 
</P>
<P>
Scriven, who lived in Escondido, was chased down on foot by Officer Martin 
Hewlett after the teen-ager was spotted driving a stolen car. He led police on 
a car chase before he abandoned the vehicle in the 3000 block of North 
Broadway, just north of the city limits, and ran into thick brush in an open 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett caught up with the youth on foot and the two struggled, with Hewlett 
ending up on his back with the teen-ager over him, according to Escondido 
police reports. Police Chief Vince Jimno said that, when Hewlett reached for 
his handgun, Scriven struggled for it and the officer, fearing for his own 
life, fired 15 rounds from the semi-automatic weapon, which was loaded with 16 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Scriven died at the scene of multiple gunshot wounds. The shooting sparked a 
controversy because of the number of times Hewlett fired his gun. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno defended his officer's actions, saying Hewlett did what he felt was 
necessary to save his own life during what he perceived as a life-and-death 
struggle with Scriven. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy report does not set out to justify the shooting, but merely lays 
out in medical language the number of times Scriven was shot, where he was 
shot, and the paths the bullets took through his body. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing for Drugs 
</P>
<P>
A separate toxicology report, which would show whether drugs were detected in 
Scriven's body, is not complete. Dr. Ronald Rivers, the chief medical examiner 
for the county, said Tuesday that the delay in receiving the toxicology report 
indicates that tests showed the existence of drugs and that further testing is 
being done to determine what types, and in what quantities, they were detected. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the gunshots, other injuries on Scriven that were noted in the 
autopsy report appeared consistent with Scriven and Hewlett fighting, including 
a broken thumb, bruises on his face and a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy report, prepared by Rivers, said Scriven was shot three times at 
close range, with powder burns on two wounds in his left hand and on a wound on 
the left side of his back. 
</P>
<P>
Scriven was struck by bullets 11 other times: Twice in his left chest, once in 
his left forearm, four times in his buttocks, twice in his left leg, once in 
his left hip and another wound, without powder burns, in his back. 
</P>
<P>
The two chest wounds and one of the leg wounds were from the front, the autopsy 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight of the shots hit Scriven from the back -- consistent, Escondido 
police have maintained, with Hewlett firing at Scriven even as he was falling 
off of the officer after the initial shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Review by District Attorney 
</P>
<P>
Rivers said his autopsy did not attempt to determine what position Scriven was 
in when he was shot. "To say they (the angles of the wounds) are consistent 
with him being bent over or sideways or upside down is pure speculation," 
Rivers said. "That would be something an attorney would have to bring out, 
along with the police. But, with that number of gunshot wounds, from lots of 
different angles, there were lots of possible positions. Many times an 
individual is in a moving position at the time they sustain as many gunshot 
wounds as we see here." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office is reviewing the case, as is customary when a 
police officer is involved in a fatal shooting. The Escondido Police Department 
has promised its own internal review of the incident as well, pending the 
district attorney's conclusions.

A man was killed trying to cross Interstate 5, just south of Interstate 805 in 
San Ysidro, Monday night, authorities said.

<P>
Maria de Los Angeles Ortiz, 21, was driving northbound at 50 m.p.h. in a 1983 
Plymouth when she struck the man about 10 p.m., California Highway Patrol 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the man was Mexican but have not established his identity.

<P>
The death occurred in an area where there has been a rash of pedestrian deaths. 
Freeways near the border have become dangerous barriers to illegal aliens who 
try to cross them at night.

COMPROMISE ORDERED ON INS SEIZURE OF PAPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge Tuesday ordered attorneys for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and advocates for farm-worker amnesty applicants to work 
out a compromise on a lawsuit filed against Border Patrol agents who have 
illegally seized documents from dozens of migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving in San Diego ordered INS attorney 
Charles Hamilton and Stephen Rosenbaum, a lawyer with the California Rural 
Legal Assistance, to reach a compromise by April 24. CRLA lawyers teamed up 
with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue the INS in December to stop the 
border agents from seizing the documents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seizure Stopped 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hamilton argued that the lawsuit is moot because the INS stopped 
seizing documents in the Western Region in October and the practice was 
discontinued in the rest of the nation by Dec. 28. INS officials admitted that 
Border Patrol agents seized amnesty documents from about 350 people who had 
legally obtained them from INS offices. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rosenbaum argued that the INS had not gone far enough. Rosenbaum said 
he wanted the INS to seek out the people whose papers had been seized and 
provide them with new documents. Dozens of migrants charged that Border Patrol 
agents forced them to sign phony confessions admitting that the documents they 
had received from INS offices were fraudulent. Rosenbaum also asked that these 
"confessions that were made through coercion" be stricken from the applicants' 
files. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge said that he saw some legitimate claims on these two issues and 
ordered both sides to work on a compromise," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton called the number of documents admittedly seized by Border Patrol 
agents insignificant. "The taking of documents from 350 people out of 1.3 
million applicants is not a statistically significant number," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the INS has already agreed to notify "everyone that the INS can 
identify who had their documents taken away." He called the dispute minor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allowed to Work 
</P>
<P>
Some workers have said they received their documents at border processing 
stations in Laredo, Tex., San Ysidro and Otay Mesa in the summer of 1987. The 
legal papers allowed them to work in the United States for up to 90 days, 
during which time they would also have to acquire more documentation to prove 
that they qualified for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
But the migrants said the documents given them by INS officials were seized at 
Border Patrol checkpoints by agents who accused them of buying them illegally 
and threatened them with prison terms.

San Diego police warned residents in the San Carlos area to lock their car 
doors and be alert for strangers after reports that one man has raped four 
women in the area since October. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the assaults, which occurred Oct. 21, Jan. 11, Feb. 1 and Feb. 17, 
the rapist approached the women at night as they were getting out of their 
cars, forced them back inside, drove them to a secluded area, then raped them, 
police spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, the man approached a woman sunbathing in the early afternoon, 
forced her to take him to her apartment, then raped her there, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have a composite sketch of the man and describe him as white, 5 feet, 8 
inches to 6 feet tall, 30 to 40 years old, weighing 150 to 160 pounds, wearing 
glasses and having a mustache and full beard. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to contact the police Sex Crimes Unit at

SEX SHOP ALLOWED TO REMAIN OPEN PENDING HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that a controversial Studio City sex shop 
can remain open pending the outcome of an April hearing in a lawsuit filed by 
the shop's owners against the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of Le Sex Shoppe at 12323 Ventura Blvd. filed suit Friday against 
the city because the City Council had denied their request to continue 
operating the shop until 1991, said G. Randall Garrou, an attorney for the 
shop. The lawsuit seeks to overturn the decision to close the shop, Garrou 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin ruled that the shop, which is operated by 
Erotic World Pictures, could remain open pending the outcome of the hearing, 
which is scheduled April 14. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Thomas A. Kathe said that a 1986 city ordinance requires 
sexually oriented establishments to move by the end of March, 1988, if they are 
within 500 feet of residences. Kathe said that many businesses with long-term 
leases, such as Le Sex Shoppe, applied for three-year extensions. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously Feb. 1 to reject the shop's request for an 
extension and ordered it to close by today. City zoning officials concluded 
that Le Sex Shoppe, which includes a bookstore and video arcade, violates 
another city ordinance prohibiting more than one adult business from operating 
under one roof, Kathe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General-Interest Films 
</P>
<P>
The shop's owners said that five of the arcade's eight viewing booths show 
general-interest films, such as "Crocodile Dundee," so it should not be 
considered an adult establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a technical issue," Garrou said. "We contend that there is only one" 
adult business on the site -- the bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
The Le Sex Shoppe chain operates 23 stores in Southern California, including 
four in the San Fernando Valley. Although the Studio City shop was denied an 
extension, Le Sex Shoppes in Sherman Oaks, North Hollywood and Canoga Park were 
granted extensions in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City shop long has been criticized by city officials and 
neighborhood residents, who maintain that it contributes to crime in the area. 
Since February, 1986, police have made 24 lewd-conduct arrests at the shop. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn filed a 
nuisance-abatement lawsuit on Jan. 31 against the owners of the Studio City Le 
Sex Shoppe to force them to increase security and discourage criminal activity 
in or around the premises. No hearing date has been scheduled.

L.A. MAN FOUND GUILTY OF HELPING TO PLOT DEATH OF POLICE DETECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A man who helped plan the 1985 revenge slaying of a Los Angeles police 
detective was acquitted of first-degree murder Tuesday but was convicted of 
conspiracy to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Voltaire Alphonse Williams, 25, of Los Angeles is scheduled to be sentenced to 
25 years to life in prison by Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz 
on March 27. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court jury convicted Williams of helping plan the Halloween, 1985, 
revenge slaying of Detective Thomas C. Williams, killed in a volley of gunfire 
as he picked up his 6-year-old son from a Canoga Park day-care center. The 
child escaped injury. Voltaire Williams is not related to the slain officer. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men, Daniel Jenkins, 33, and Ruben Antonio Moss, 26, were convicted 
earlier in the ambush killing. In October, Jenkins was sentenced to die in the 
gas chamber; Moss was sentenced to life in prison in December. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, a North Hollywood limousine company owner, had plotted to have the 
detective killed to prevent him from testifying in a robbery trial in which 
Jenkins was the defendant, according to testimony. But the plan to kill the 
detective did not work out and he testified, authorities said. Jenkins, who was 
convicted of robbery the day after the slaying, killed the officer in 
retaliation for his testimony, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated 2 1/2 days before reaching the verdict against Voltaire 
Williams. It is continuing to consider the fate of co-defendants Duane Moody, 
31, and Reecy Clem Cooper, 34, each charged with murder and conspiracy to 
commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have said the three men did not know each other. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors accused Voltaire Williams of meeting with Daniel Jenkins and 
another man on Oct. 24, 1985, at a Reseda skating rink to plan the killing. 
</P>
<P>
However, Williams' attorney, Lewis Watnick, said his client, an aspiring boxer, 
initially agreed to help Jenkins kill the officer but backed out. Watnick said 
Voltaire Williams was in Oakland at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave back the gun and the gloves six days before the murder took place," 
Watnick said, recalling witnesses' testimony during the 10-week-long trial. "He 
was going to do it, but then he couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
Watnick and Charles Lloyd, who also represented Williams, said they were not 
pleased with the verdict on the conspiracy charge and plan to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard L. Jenkins said: "We're pleased. We think the 
verdict was supported by the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor disputed the claim that Voltaire Williams had backed out of the 
conspiracy but agreed that he had been out of town when the shooting occurred.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

<TEXT>
<P>
A man was in critical condition Tuesday night at Mercy Hospital after being 
shot in the neck by a police officer who believed the man was trying to run him 
over in a City Heights parking lot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, whose identity was not available, saw a car he suspected was 
stolen in a parking lot at Modesto and Juniper streets shortly after 2 p.m. 
Tuesday. After running a license-plate check, which confirmed that the car was 
stolen, the officer approached the driver, police spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver suddenly backed out of a parking space and gunned his engine, Cohen 
said, leading the officer to believe the driver was trying to run him down. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired two shots at the car as it came toward him, then dived out of 
the way. Cohen said at least one shot hit the driver in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the car left the parking lot, turning onto Juniper Street and 
continuing to Sumac Drive, where the driver staggered out, bleeding heavily. 
The man walked about 100 yards before collapsing on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Mercy Hospital spokeswoman Laura Avalone said the driver, who was in his 20s, 
underwent surgery and was in critical condition.

BANE DEFENDS RECORD ON S &amp; LS; TASK FORCE TO REVIEW LAWS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bane (D-Tarzana) on Tuesday defended his record as a champion 
of savings and loan industry legislation, declaring that "every bill of mine 
was for the benefit of the public." 
</P>
<P>
Attention has been focused recently on Bane's efforts on behalf of savings and 
loans, especially his ability to tap thrift institutions for campaign 
contributions while carrying measures on behalf of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Also questioned was a bill he sponsored that revoked some state anti-fraud 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In a move that could affect that legislation, it was announced that a task 
force is being established to look into ways for the Legislature to strengthen 
regulation of the savings and loan industry, which has suffered an increasing 
number of collapses nationwide in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Assembly task force is expected to review a 110-page 
law designed to streamline regulation of the industry. Bane pushed the measure 
through the Legislature in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repeal of Statutes 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Patrick Johnston (D-Stockton), chairman of the Assembly Finance and 
Insurance Committee, said the task force will look into the law's repeal of 
certain anti-fraud statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Bane failed to tell colleagues about the repeal of the statutes, according to a 
public affairs program scheduled for broadcast tonight on a San Francisco 
public television station. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston indicated that state authorities should have the enforcement powers 
that were removed by Bane. Johnston cautioned that because both the state and 
federal governments charter savings and loans, it is important to give the 
state savings and loan commissioner "the authority to move against institutions 
and their officers" when they act improperly. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Thayer, legislative coordinator for the state Department of Savings and 
Loans, described Bane as "extremely cooperative with the department in carrying 
legislation which expanded the commissioner's power to regulate the savings and 
loan industry." 
</P>
<P>
She maintained that the anti-fraud statutes were deleted by Bane because they 
duplicated federal statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Thayer acknowledged, however, that some state anti-fraud provisions Bane 
removed, effective in 1984, including one that prohibited officers of savings 
and loans from pocketing huge loans fees or kickbacks, have not been put back 
into the law. She said similar prohibitions are in federal law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Received Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it was reported that soon after Bane received contributions from two 
financial institutions early in 1988, he introduced a bill that opponents said 
would have aided the two firms in a pending multimillion-dollar lawsuit. He 
denied anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bane scoffed at questions about his legislation, maintaining that 
the goal of his bills has been "to try to strengthen and secure the deposits of 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Bane also pointed to the growing number of savings and 
loans that have collapsed, saying, "If there's anything to indicate I was on 
the right track, it's what's happening today." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said he has been asked to head the task force on savings and loans. He 
added that it is likely that Bane, regarded as the Legislature's expert in the 
field, will be a member. 
</P>
<P>
Bane, 75, is chairman of the powerful Assembly Rules Committee. In 1987-88, he 
raised $1.2 million in campaign contributions, including $102,480 from the 
savings and loan industry, according to his campaign statements.

<TEXT>
<P>
Afire that spread through a dry-cleaning business in San Fernando caused 
$255,000 damage, the Los Angeles Fire Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 9:50 p.m. Monday at Day and Night Cleaners in the 1200 
block of Mott Street, officials said. Los Angeles firefighters, who provide

T-Bill Auction: The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion of three-month bills 
at an average discount rate of 8.51%, up from 8.49% last week. Another $7.2 
billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.50%, 
down from 8.54% last week. The rates for six-month bills were the lowest since 
Jan. 30, when they averaged 8.39%. The rates for three-month bills were the 
highest since they averaged 8.57% on Feb. 6. The discount rate reflects the 
price discount received when government securities are purchased at less than 
face value.

2 COURT RULINGS CURB FIGHT ON PORNOGRAPHY; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICES BAR STORE CLOSURES, PANDERING CHARGES BUT ALLOW SENTENCES ON 
ANTI-RACKETEERING LAWS 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected two novel and sweeping attacks on 
pornography, unanimously ruling that police may not padlock stores that sell 
obscene books and prohibiting California prosecutors from charging X-rated film 
makers with pandering. 
</P>
<P>
But, while those decisions deprive prosecutors of powerful weapons in their war 
against pornography, the high court also ruled that bookstore owners convicted 
of selling obscenity can be tried and sentenced to as much as 10 years in 
prison under federal and state anti-racketeering laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Without Trial 
</P>
<P>
Rather than trying to convince a jury that a book or movie is obscene, 
prosecutors in Indiana and Los Angeles had sought to shut down adult bookstores 
and X-rated movie productions without ever going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court concluded that the free speech clause of the First 
Amendment does not permit short-circuiting of the legal process. The result is 
that prosecutors must prove a book or film is obscene -- a tough task in many 
cities -- before they can take action against its producer or distributor. 
</P>
<P>
In the pandering case, the justices without comment rejected a plea by Los 
Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira B. Reiner to reinstate the conviction of an adult film 
maker who had hired actors to engage in sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices permitted prosecutors to use the tough provisions of 
anti-racketeering laws on a 6-3 vote in the Indiana case. The harsh penalties, 
contained in state and federal anti-racketeering laws, have been applied to 
obscene books or films only in the last few years. The conservative court 
majority said that it was not troubled by the idea that the threat of 
racketeering charges could promote censorship. 
</P>
<P>
"Some booksellers will practice self-censorship and remove (non-obscene) 
materials from their shelves," Justice Byron R. White conceded. "But deterrence 
of the sale of obscene materials is a legitimate end of state anti-obscenity 
laws." 
</P>
<P>
But his opinion also sidestepped a key question. Can a bookstore owner, once 
convicted of selling two or more obscene books, be labeled a racketeer and thus 
lose his entire store, including thousands of books that are not obscene? Or 
could a videotape dealer, convicted of renting two obscene films, be forced to 
forfeit his entire business? 
</P>
<P>
While a pretrial seizure of books or films is unconstitutional, White said, the 
court would reserve judgment on whether a sweeping post-trial forfeiture order 
is also unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Closely Watched 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana case (Ft. Wayne Books vs. Indiana, 87-470) has been closely watched 
since former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III proclaimed that the racketeering laws 
offered a powerful new weapon with which to attack obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970 Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, is 
feared by businesses -- both legal and illegal -- because it permits the 
government to seize any enterprise found to engage in two or more acts of 
"racketeering." 
</P>
<P>
At first, racketeering was limited to crimes such as murder and arson, but in 
1984 Congress amended the law to include "obscenity" as one of the offenses. 
Indiana was the first state to use the RICO law to attack pornography. Since 
then, 18 others, including California, have followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, police in Ft. Wayne picked up several allegedly obscene publications 
in a local adult bookstore. Later the same day, a prosecutor got a court order 
to padlock the store and seize everything in it, including cash registers and 
furniture. Two other outlets owned by the same people also were shut down. The 
case against the store owners has never come to trial, although the Indiana 
courts upheld the padlocking and the seizure. 
</P>
<P>
All nine justices said that such a pretrial seizure is unconstitutional under 
the First Amendment. But the six-member majority said that the state can use 
the RICO law to prosecute bookstore owners for selling obscene materials. The 
dissenters, Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood 
Marshall, said that the First Amendment forbids such prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed ruling gave both prosecutors and attorneys for the bookstores 
something to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
William Daily, chief counsel for the Indiana attorney general, said that RICO 
"gives us a valuable tool. This says you can't hide your criminal activity 
(selling obscene books) behind the fact that you are a bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills attorney who defended the booksellers, said 
that he is "pleased the court rejected this attempt to avoid First Amendment 
scrutiny by labeling something as racketeering." 
</P>
<P>
In the California case, Los Angeles prosecutors in 1983 charged X-rated film 
maker Harold Freeman with pandering for having hired actors to perform sex acts 
before the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
State law makes it a felony "to procure another person for prostitution," which 
in turn is defined as "any lewd act between persons for money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Stunned 
</P>
<P>
Freeman was found guilty of five counts of pandering. In 1987, a state 
appellate court in Los Angeles upheld the conviction in a ruling that stunned 
California's large adult film-making industry. Some Hollywood lawyers pointed 
out that this reading of the pandering law could make it a crime to hire actors 
for any sexually explicit scenes in plays or major motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
But last August, the state Supreme Court unanimously reversed the conviction. 
The opinion by Justice Marcus M. Kaufman said that the state's pandering and 
prostitution laws were not intended to cover actors. Moreover, applying them to 
actors and film makers "would infringe on First Amendment values," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner, appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court, complained that the state justices 
had used the U.S. Constitution to give X-rated film makers a "broad immunity" 
under California's pandering laws. 
</P>
<P>
But the justices dismissed the appeal (California vs. Freeman, 88-1054), 
apparently on the grounds that Kaufman's opinion was based on a reading of 
state law, not the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruled 6 to 3 that states may not exempt religious publications from general 
sales taxes on books, newspapers and magazines. The splintered majority, in 
three separate opinions, said that such exemptions amount to favoritism for 
religion (Texas Monthly vs. Bullock, 87-1245). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cleared the way for a trial in a $90-million slander suit against TV 
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart brought by rival evangelist Marvin Gorman. Swaggart 
contended that the Constitution does not permit the courts to interfere with 
church business, but justices rejected his appeal without comment (Swaggart vs. 
Adler, 88-1080). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to decide whether the City of Los Angeles must pay damages to a taxi 
company that went out of business after a 1981 labor dispute. Three years ago, 
the high court said that the City Council had acted illegally when it refused 
to renew the franchise of the Golden State Transit Corp. because of its labor 
troubles. But afterward, an appeals court said the company was due only the 
right to win back its franchise. Calling this a "hollow victory" because it had 
already ceased operation, Golden State appealed again seeking damages. The case 
(Golden State Transit vs. Los Angeles, 88-840) will be heard in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Agreed to hear next fall two cases (Michigan vs. Harvey, 88-512, and James 
vs. Illinois, 88-6075) testing the limits of the so-called exclusionary rule, 
under which illegally obtained evidence may not be used at a trial.

ASIA TRIP GIVES BUSH CHANCE TO REVIEW POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, embarking today on a whirlwind, 100-hour visit to Japan, China 
and South Korea, attends the funeral this week of the emperor who reigned in 
Japan during World War II and greets a dozen or so leaders whose cooperation he 
will need as he crafts a foreign policy for what he hopes will be a period of 
reduced global tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's first major international journey as President offers mostly symbolic 
opportunities in the crucial Pacific Basin rather than the prospect of 
direction-setting initiatives. The more immediate impact may be on the home 
front, where Bush is fighting suggestions that his measured, deliberative 
approach to setting a foreign policy is allowing the nation to drift on the 
world stage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Negative Approach' 
</P>
<P>
"I simply don't agree with that," Bush said, with an edge to his voice, at a 
news conference Tuesday. "I really hadn't ever heard such a negative approach 
to foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "we have a foreign policy," Bush said that the 17,000-mile trip 
will advance his process of carefully reviewing East-West relations, events in 
South America and the U.S. role in the Middle East as specific goals and 
courses are plotted. 
</P>
<P>
There will be time for only brief meetings in Tokyo with no more than a dozen 
of the approximately 60 government leaders visiting Japan for the funeral of 
Emperor Hirohito. But the trip -- according to White House National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft -- "is an opportunity to underscore not only the 
importance of the three countries that the President will be visiting to 
American interests, but also the growing importance of the U.S. relationship to 
Asia as a whole, and to point out, again, that the United States is an Asian 
power." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the high-profile appearance in international settings also 
presents a valuable opportunity in a more parochial realm. It is a chance to 
extend the honeymoon phase of the new presidency at a time when it is suffering 
the sorts of nicks and scratches that eventually dull the shiny veneer of a new 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
If shifting attention from controversies and criticisms in Washington "turns 
out to be a dividend, let it never be said (that) this Administration ever 
refused to accept a dividend," White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Criticism 
</P>
<P>
Criticism has been growing in Washington that the new Administration may be 
moving too slowly in developing foreign policy initiatives toward the Soviet 
Union, Nicaragua and other key nations and regions. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush did not spell out specific policies that will be pressed on the 
trip, he said that U.S. policy in the Middle East is intended to encourage 
discussions between Jordan's King Hussein and Israel. Bush plans to meet with 
Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli President Chaim Herzog in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also intends to meet with key figures from Belgium, Brazil, France, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, West Germany and Japan, said 
Scowcroft, in a schedule "that fills up almost every spare minute that the 
President has." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to see as many as possible, so the substance will not be 
extensive," Scowcroft said in a briefing for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said that the topics will range from superpower relations and 
the complicated U.S.-Japanese relationship to the unsolved problems of Third 
World debt. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the trip is "not with how long the meetings necessarily are 
and how much substance, but the significance of a face-to-face opportunity to 
get, at least, out on the table a few issues for discussion," Scowcroft said. 
"That's very, very important, and it eases the sense of communication between 
countries after that if you've had this kind of personal contact." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Courtesy Calls in China 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, several courtesy calls are being squeezed into a tight schedule but 
only one in-depth, lengthy session -- with Premier Li Peng -- is planned. A 
stop in Seoul on the way home from China is scheduled for barely four hours. 
</P>
<P>
The six-day trip represents the latest phase in a presidency that, in its first 
five weeks, has unfolded in phases. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first 10 days or so, the President's aides say, offered the nation a 
view of who George Bush is, and the standards -- particularly in ethical 
behavior -- that he expects from those who work for him. The ethics question, 
however, reflected unfavorably when two of his closest advisers, Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III and White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, encountered 
pointed criticism over their initial reluctance to release control over their 
substantial financial investments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Next came the unveiling of his fiscal 1990 budget priorities, meant to put 
some flesh on the vision of a "kinder and gentler" America that he drew during 
the presidential campaign. But he did not highlight any central themes of his 
proposal, provoking complaints from Democrats that he had turned over to 
Congress the political liability of deciding which programs to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Now the focus turns to foreign affairs, as the White House takes advantage 
of the timing of Hirohito's funeral during a politically difficult period in 
Washington when the Senate is focusing on the embattled nomination of former 
Sen. John Tower to be secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeking Direction 
</P>
<P>
Throughout it all, the Administration has been weighing the direction it 
intends to pursue in foreign policy, even as it continues to assemble its 
national security group at the Pentagon and State Department.

Asked for evidence that the United States had set a course for its relations 
with Asia, Scowcroft conceded that it is "unfortunate that the President 
doesn't have his national security team in place as yet," but he said 
sarcastically at a White House briefing for reporters: 
</P>
<P>
"One month after he's come into office we're already worrying that he's not 
charging off in all directions with finished policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the President is not trying to make quick headlines. What he is 
trying to put into place is a foreign and national security policy which will 
look forward . . . toward the end of the century and try to set in place 
near-term actions which will aid us in where we think we'd like to be at the 
end of the century." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bush said he is undismayed by such developments as the current 
Middle East tour of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be stampeded by the fact that the Soviet foreign minister 
takes a trip to the Middle East. In my view, that's a good thing," he said, 
adding that he envisioned "a limited role" for the Soviets in that troubled 
region. 
</P>
<P>
As for the timing of his own trip, of course, Bush had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Japanese announced that the funeral for Hirohito, who died Jan. 7, 
would be Feb. 24, the only question for the President was whether to attend -- 
a decision about which there was little debate, given the importance of Japan 
to U.S. policy in Asia and to the global economy, White House aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the view of White House officials, others who are advising Bush and 
such outside observers as Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, the timing 
provided an opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Many Glitches' 
</P>
<P>
"His takeoff hasn't been flawless. There have been too many glitches," said 
Hess, a student of the presidency since the Administration of Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. "Here's an opportunity to 'Come fly with me,' get above Washington 
and look like a statesman." 
</P>
<P>
While the President and his staff have yet to be caught in the grip of the sort 
of crisis atmosphere that invariably takes over the White House from time to 
time, there have been political crises of sorts, seen and unseen. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, they're still learning," said Rep. Richard Cheney (R-Wyo.), the 
assistant House minority leader and chief of staff in the Gerald R. Ford White 
House. "There's a shakedown process under way. They're learning. Give them a 
little bit of time." 
</P>
<P>
There was the quickly aborted plan to charge savings and loan depositors a fee 
on their savings to help bolster the sagging S&amp;L industry. And there were 
questions that flared up and then vanished as the White House mobilized behind 
the scenes to defend the Cabinet nominations of Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp, since confirmed by the Senate, and Louis W. Sullivan, who 
has yet to face Senate hearings as Bush's choice for secretary of health and 
human services. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the nomination of Tower to be secretary of defense ran into a wall of 
allegations and doubt that has not yet been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I'm very upset. I don't think this is any way to start a new 
Administration," groused one White House newcomer, recognizing the need for 
what he called "some serious damage control." 
</P>
<P>
Others, taking their cue from the President, say that the controversies have 
not diverted them from the initial tasks of setting the Administration on 
course. Indeed, they say, the Asian trip represents an opportunity to chart a 
course in a crucial part of the world without distracting them from more 
pressing domestic issues. 
</P>
<P>
"The White House is reeling. The White House is spiraling," a senior White 
House official muttered mockingly as he walked down the silent corridor just 
beyond the Oval Office on a day when the allegations about Tower were 
particularly bothersome. "I don't notice much reeling. I don't notice much 
spiraling." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A VISIT TO ASIA 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's trip to three Asian capitals will include these visits: 
</P>
<P>
TOKYO 
</P>
<P>
Akasaka Palace -- Modeled on the palace at Versailles and on the Louvre, it was 
completed in 1909 to be the crown prince's residence. Emperor Hirohito, whose 
funeral Bush will attend Friday, lived at the palace before he ascended the 
throne in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
The Imperial Palace -- The main ceremonial building within 284 acres of ponds, 
moats and forests in the center of Tokyo was built in 1968 to replace a 
structure destroyed in World War II. In the 17th Century the complex was the 
headquarters of the Tokugawa Shogunate that ruled Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Shinjuku Imperial Gardens -- This park, the site of Hirohito's funeral 
services, once served as the garden for the imperial household. 
</P>
<P>
BEIJING 
</P>
<P>
Great Hall -- Built for the celebration of the Communist government's 10-year 
anniversary in 1959, it sits on Tienanmen 
</P>
<P>
Square in the traditional heart of the city and is the site for all major 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
Zhongnanhai -- A 213-acre compound that includes two large lakes that used to 
be part of the imperial palace grounds, it now serves as Communist Party 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Chongwenmen Christian Church -- Bush is expected to attend services at this 
Protestant church. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Times 
</P>
<P>
SEOUL 
</P>
<P>
The Blue House -- The nation's presidential residence since the Republic of 
Korea was formed in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly -- Home of South Korea's unicameral legislative body. 
</P>
<P>
Yongsan garrison -- Actually a city within a city, this is headquarters for the 
Combined Forces Command, the U.S. Forces Korea, the U.S. 8th Army and the 
United Nations Command.

QUESTIONNAIRE MAY HERALD INSURANCE PRICING CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what could foreshadow a new approach to pricing auto insurance, the 
Automobile Club of Southern California is sending a detailed questionnaire to 
its policyholders, asking them such questions as whether they drink or smoke, 
exactly where they park their car and how many miles they commute each day to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The aim, said the Auto Club's director of underwriting, Alan Morris, is to 
compile a more precise personal record on each of the club's 1 million 
customers in preparation for enforcing Proposition 103's mandated downgrading 
of territorial rating -- the ZIP code where one lives -- as a key pricing 
criterion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a clamoring in the public saying, 'I want my premium to be based on 
me, not where I live,' " Morris said. "But we've found there is a reluctance to 
answer some of these questions." 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of those receiving the club questionnaire have not returned it. The 
questions include whether policyholders have "consumed alcohol" or "smoked 
tobacco" in the last 12 months, or whether those 55 or older have taken a 
Department of Motor Vehicles-approved eight-hour "Mature Driver Improvement 
Course." 
</P>
<P>
The organization recently sent out a "second request," telling its 
policyholders: "Please reply promptly. The questionnaire includes new 
information we must have for rating purposes under Proposition 103." 
</P>
<P>
Other major companies, such as Farmers, say they are waiting to see exactly 
what regulations on new methods for pricing policies are promulgated later in 
the year by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for 20th Century, Rick Dinon, said Monday: "One thing that's 
very clear is that the data our company is going to need from its policyholders 
will have to be broader and more accurate, as well as more timely. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Under 103, you do need more information and it needs to be specific to that 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 states that beginning Nov. 8, 1989, the most important criteria 
for pricing auto insurance, in order of priority, must be "the insured's 
driving safety record, the number of miles he or she drives annually (and) the 
number of years of driving experience the insured has had." 
</P>
<P>
Only after those three factors is the insurance commissioner allowed to "adopt 
by regulation" other factors she believes "have a substantial relationship to 
the risk of loss." She can assign a "respective weight" to be given to each of 
these other factors, but none of the additional factors can be as important in 
pricing as the first three factors. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of the Proposition 103 campaign, said this week 
that he believes that the Auto Club's questionnaire, about which he said he had 
heard many consumer complaints, is premature, since the commissioner has not 
yet issued any regulations. And he suggested that the questionnaire is too 
nosy. 
</P>
<P>
But the Auto Club's Morris said, "We will reach a point when we start surveying 
our policies that come up for renewal in November that we will have to have 
sufficient information to comply with whatever rating plan the insurance 
commissioner promulgates." 
</P>
<P>
This is presuming that the state Supreme Court upholds that part of Proposition 
103 when it rules on its constitutionality sometime this spring. State Farm's 
general counsel, Pete Ingham, said Monday that his company, the largest seller 
of auto insurance in California, is delaying sending out any questionnaire 
until it sees how the high court rules. 
</P>
<P>
But the Auto Club is getting ready now, and customers are being told that a 
response is necessary by a specified date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Detailed Questions 
</P>
<P>
The form is quite detailed. It asks, for instance, whether the insured vehicle 
is parked mostly on the street or in a driveway, a carport or a garage. 
</P>
<P>
Other questions concern whether the vehicle has an anti-theft device that 
either emits an audible burglar alarm signal, cuts off fuel or defeats 
ignition; whether it has been structurally or mechanically altered; whether it 
is driven more than once a week in a business, occupation or profession, or 
whether it has any special equipment such as four-wheel drive, winch or 
hydraulic lift. 
</P>
<P>
As for the drinking and smoking questions, Morris said, "We have been asking 
them on new policies since early last year, but we never captured that 
information on our existing policies until this time. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what rating factors the insurance commissioner will, in fact, 
permit or require," Morris said. "But if, for example, the commissioner would 
say that a nonsmoking discount is justified, we need to have that in our data 
base." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drinking Habits Asked 
</P>
<P>
If a policyholder answers that he has "consumed alcohol" in the last year, "it 
would not (immediately) affect the rates or our willingness to insure," the 
Auto Club official added. "The reason we've put that question in there is to 
determine sometime in the future if there's a correlation between nondrinkers 
and drinkers in claim frequency. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask the question, 'Are you a heavy drinker?' no one will say yes." So, 
Morris said, policyholders have been asked whether they drink at all on the 
assumption that most will answer that question honestly. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important questions being asked, he indicated, has to do with 
annual mileage. "Currently, we don't charge by annual mileage," he explained, 
"but under Proposition 103, that becomes an important factor."

GERBODE VALLEY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was no ordinary stakeout. But then, this was no ordinary crime. 
</P>
<P>
The man crouched behind the bushes was not a cop, and he was not tracking a 
robber. He was a volunteer ranger in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, 
and he was on the trail of cagier prey. He was stalking a rogue gardener. 
</P>
<P>
Someone, for some reason, has been seeding the park north of San Francisco with 
South African capeweed. Rangers, required by law to keep the park in a natural 
state, have been scrambling to tear out the thick, fast-growing pest before it 
chokes out native grasses, bushes and berries. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the capeweed is winning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Battle Against Exotics 
</P>
<P>
A small problem in a out-of-the-way part of California? Perhaps. But it is also 
the latest battlefront in a quiet world war against undesired non-native, or 
exotic, species that are killing off less hardy but more interesting -- and 
maybe ecologically more important -- native plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Park rangers, scientists and others around the country, and worldwide, are 
locked in combat with unrelenting armies of exotics. Not only do they battle 
South African capeweed, but also the Australian melaleuca, Japanese grass, 
Himalayan raspberries and Russian thistle. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service says exotic plants are the most widespread threat to 
the natural resources of the parks. Park Service rangers recently ranked exotic 
plants ahead of such other problems as wildfires, overcrowding, pollution, 
vandalism, oil drilling and off-road vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize it, but the problem is enormous," said Cliff Smith, a 
University of Hawaii botany professor and an exotic species scientist at the 
National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flourish as Pests 
</P>
<P>
Plants and animals need not be striking or fascinating or even unusual to 
qualify as exotic. Scientists consider species exotic after they move from one 
place to another, sometimes between continents, and flourish as pests in their 
new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, mongooses are exotic in Hawaii, but so are mountain goats in parts of 
Washington and rainbow trout in Tennessee. So, too, is the capeweed -- ordinary 
freeway-median ground cover -- in California, and feral house pets everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not just one of aesthetics. Scientists warn that exotics can 
impinge on agriculture, push endangered native species closer to extinction or 
in runaway cases restructure entire ecosystems with unknown consequences. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service biologist Gary Johnston cited as one example the case of 
mongooses being introduced to Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands as a means to 
control exotic rats. 
</P>
<P>
"But mongooses operate mainly during the day while rats go out at night," 
Johnston said. "As a result, they rarely met. In the meantime, those mongooses 
have had a tremendous impact (by eating) ground-nesting birds and reptiles, 
including two endangered species." 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, Smith said researchers have found 4,000 plants not native to the 
islands. Of those, nearly 850 thrive and reproduce without human cultivation -- 
and spread like weeds. By comparison, there are 892 native Hawaiian plants. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are essentially saying is that half of all our . . . flora has been 
(artificially) introduced," he said. "It (the spread of exotic species) is a 
remarkably invasive and intrusive problem." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problems Across Nation 
</P>
<P>
Other states are less severely affected than Hawaii, but exotics are a headache 
from wetlands in Florida's Everglades to forested mountains along Washington's 
Olympic Peninsula and from the Great Smoky Mountains to the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston and others said exotic species can thrive at the expense of native 
plants and animals because the exotics usually lack natural enemies in adopted 
environments. Without predators or diseases to thin their numbers, they simply 
crowd out not-so-fortunate native species. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that there is any such thing as a bad plant," said Greg 
Archbald of the Golden Gate National Park Assn., which recruits volunteers and 
raises money to supplement the park's funding. "They (exotics) are living 
things, and they are on our planet. But when you come right down to it, this is 
a managed natural area and we are supposed to manage it to keep it natural." 
</P>
<P>
"The point of having national parks is to preserve areas as distinct parts of 
America, just as the Everglades are a living example of the natural history of 
southern Florida," said Peter Doren, an Everglades National Park scientist and 
vice chairman of the Miami-based Exotic Pest Plant Council. "If melaleuca takes 
over, what will people see? Whatever it is, it won't be the real southern 
Florida." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, scientists worry that exotics often so successfully out-compete 
native species that they create areas called monocultures in which only one 
type of vegetation or one kind of animal survives. 
</P>
<P>
"The species (in one particular area) originally have developed there over 
hundreds of thousands of years and have adapted to all the area's stresses," 
Smith said. "Species introduced artificially in the last 100 years generally 
have not. . . . These very large monocultures can crash, and when they crash, 
they leave nothing behind them." 
</P>
<P>
Some exotic species were introduced to these areas out of ignorance, others out 
of carelessness. Apparently, few species are inflicted on an area with the 
malicious intent that investigators attribute to the man suspected of planting 
capeweed near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry guava came to Hawaii as a commercial venture, but Smith said its 
attractive fruit now is usually eaten by feral hogs, which later excrete guava 
seeds over more and more of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Melaleuca trees were imported from Australia by developers eager to use the 
species' remarkable thirst to drain Florida swamps for farms and houses. Doren 
said the trees instead threaten to drain Everglades National Park. 
</P>
<P>
Pampas grass came to California as an ornamental plant for landscaping. But 
feathery seeds from its distinctive panicles, or plumes, have long since spread 
the tenacious plant widely. English ivy is another ornamental plant headache. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain goats, meanwhile, were transported to the Olympic National Park as 
game animals. Johnston said the goats consume much of the available forage and 
trample the rest, disrupting native plants and starving native animals. 
</P>
<P>
One surprising example is the Russian thistle. Cowpokes call it tumbleweed, and 
as such it evokes romantic images of the unspoiled West. Botanists see the 
humble tumbleweed as just another pest in Death Valley and the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these exotic pests are so pervasive that the Park Service is trying to 
find some way to control or eliminate them without resorting to essentially 
weeding millions of acres of public land with hand tools and volunteer labor. 
</P>
<P>
Biological controls are the preferred method, but they can take up to 15 or 20 
years to develop because scientists try to make certain that by introducing a 
new exotic species to an area they will only control a pest and not wipe out 
any more native species. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulty of being absolutely certain of all the consequences, 
scientists say safe biocontrols can be isolated and used. In Redwoods National 
Park, for example, biologists are controlling the exotic Tansy ragwort, a tiny 
herbaceous plant, with exotic moths and beetles that feed on it. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, such solutions have not yet been found. Volunteers wielding 
razor-sharp tools are the only way to cope with the capeweed left behind by the 
Golden Gate National Recreation Area's rogue gardener. 
</P>
<P>
That person, whom park volunteer Tom Ness of San Francisco has shadowed and 
reported to federal prosecutors, is believed to have spread the capeweed along 
"virtually every trail up here," Ness said -- a distance of 20 miles or more. 
Eight volunteers recently needed an entire day to rip up thick, tenacious mats 
of capeweed from about 50 feet of trail. 
</P>
<P>
Ness said the person he reported to prosecutors has a grudge against the 
government stemming from past tax problems. 
</P>
<P>
Archbald, his hands muddy and cut from wrestling capeweed from the soil and 
unknotting it from native berry vines, said his volunteers are not discouraged 
from their seemingly Sisyphean task. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Lose This Battle' 
</P>
<P>
"He (the phantom planter) is going to lose this battle eventually because 
people will care about the park a lot longer that he will live," he said. The 
biggest problem, he added, is that capeweed distracts volunteers from clearing 
out the 28 other problem exotics that have accidentally invaded the park. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Sophia Sparks of San Francisco said the capeweed caper may seem like 
an eccentric prank but is more akin to arson. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kindling here," she said, holding a length of capeweed, "but if left 
alone, in 100 years it will lead to the equivalent of a wildfire. Habitat will 
be destroyed. Rodents can't eat it, so they would be driven out, and with them 
would go the hawks that prey on the rodents, and so on and so on."

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Navy Capt. Alexander G. Balian testified Tuesday that he would have 
rescued a boatload of Vietnamese refugees his ship found adrift in the South 
China Sea if he had been correctly informed of their plight. 
</P>
<P>
His voice sometimes choking with emotion, the 48-year-old Balian told a Navy 
court-martial that if he had known the desperate conditions aboard the 
Vietnamese craft, "there is no doubt in my mind I would tow them to my side and 
embark them. That's what I did on two previous occasions." 
</P>
<P>
Balian, of Los Angeles, is charged with dereliction of duty and failing to 
provide sufficient assistance to the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
His ship, the amphibious transport Dubuque, encountered the refugees' craft 
June 9, but Balian decided not to take them aboard. Of the 110 refugees who 
left Vietnam, only 52 survived and some of them had resorted to cannibalism 
before they were rescued by Filipino fishermen June 27 after 37 days at sea, 
U.N. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian testified that his crew gave the refugees 400 pounds of food and 55 
gallons of water and added, referring to the survivors: "If it wasn't for what 
we did, those people wouldn't be alive today. 
</P>
<P>
"I am being charged with giving insufficient assistance," he said. "What is 
sufficient?" he added, raising his voice. "If I assisted them forever and ever 
and ever and ever, would that be sufficient assistance?" 
</P>
<P>
When the Dubuque came across the refugees' junk, Balian said, he ordered his 
executive officer, Lt. Cmdr. Stanley Halter, to determine if the craft was 
seaworthy. 
</P>
<P>
Halter, who went by boat to inspect the junk and reported to Balian by radio, 
told him the refugees said they did not need medical assistance and felt they 
could continue if given food and water, Balian testified. 
</P>
<P>
Based on poor interpreting, mistaken information and faulty communication, 
Balian said he made the decision to leave the refugees behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I made my decision like any commanding officer had to," using the information 
at hand, Balian said. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we did a good job. In fact (the refugees) waved happily in thanks" 
after being given the food and water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said he later realized his crew had inadvertently given him incorrect 
information. 
</P>
<P>
He said Halter had told him the refugees said they had been at sea for seven 
days when it was more like 19, according to later investigation. 
</P>
<P>
He said Halter also said the refugees told him they had had no food and water 
for three days, although later investigation suggested it was more like a week. 
</P>
<P>
Halter also said the refugees reported they had no engine, although in fact 
they had a broken one, which Balian said his crew probably would have fixed for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Balian also said he was unaware his executive officer had not placed any medics 
on board three boats sent out to check the conditions on the junk. 
</P>
<P>
He said he looked at the refugees through binoculars from the bridge of the 
Dubuque, at a distance of between 240 and 600 feet, but could not see any naked 
refugees on board, nor the degree to which they were emaciated, as depicted in 
photographs taken with zoom lenses by his crew.

ITALIAN LEADER TO LOSE PARTY POST, PERILING COALITION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Against a backdrop of lofty rhetoric and savage infighting, Italy's largest 
political party is in the throes of a leadership change that could mean an 
early death for the coalition government led by Prime Minister Ciriaco De Mita. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates to a congress of the Christian Democratic Party, which has been 
Italy's party of government for four decades, will vote today to replace De 
Mita as party secretary and leader. 
</P>
<P>
Arnaldo Forlani, the elegant, 63-year-old former prime minister, is the party's 
choice to succeed De Mita. Forlani, who has a reputation as a cautious and 
patient mediator, represents the conservative wing of the party, whose members 
range from moderate leftists to traditionalist Roman Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
When De Mita became prime minister last April, he argued that holding that post 
and the party leadership simultaneously would lend stability and efficiency to 
his reform effort. However, the Christian Democrats, who have served in every 
one of Italy's 47 postwar governments, have preferred that the party leader not 
be prime minister; they believe this arrangement reduces the room for political 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, De Mita's five-party coalition has proven to be weak, unable to remedy 
such problems as a growing national deficit and poor public services; nor has 
there been any sign of the long-promised party renovation. 
</P>
<P>
De Mita, a polished tactician and scarred political realist, came to his 
party's 18th congress over the weekend ready to relinquish the party post he 
has held since 1982. Still, he hoped to see his own candidate, legislator Mino 
Martinazzoli, elected to replace him, thereby keeping command within the 
party's left wing. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Forlani's candidacy was forced on De Mita by Forlani's centrists, by 
defectors from his own faction and by the party's right wing, led by Foreign 
Minister Giulio Andreotti. 
</P>
<P>
In voting tonight, the congress may elect De Mita to replace Forlani as party 
president -- a sinecure -- but even that would not restore the prime minister's 
lost political authority. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how much power De Mita, shorn of his party post, will be able 
to exert in government over the shifting factions of his party or centrist 
coalition partners, who are disgruntled at what they consider his inflationary 
surrender to labor union demands last month. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 months in an office he has said he hopes to hold from two to four 
years, De Mita has achieved only one successful reform: abolition of the secret 
vote in Parliament, which had enabled maverick coalition legislators to 
undercut government legislation with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
The aftermath of the congress may nudge the Christian Democrats away from any 
possible De Mita-fashioned alliances with Italy's Communists and closer to 
their Socialist government partners. "We offer the Socalists solid ground, not 
quicksand," Forlani told the congress. 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled, silver-haired Forlani is seen as a unifying figure within the 
party.

HAVEL CONVICTED FOR PROTEST AMID COMMUNIST CRACKDOWN

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel was convicted Tuesday for his role in an 
unauthorized rally and sentenced to nine months in prison as Czechoslovakia's 
Communist authorities persevered in their hard-line stance against human rights 
activists and opposition forces. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, who was taken to and from a closely guarded courtroom in a sealed police 
van, had been in custody since his arrest Jan. 16 during a demonstration to 
honor the memory of a youth who burned himself to death to protest the Soviet 
invasion that crushed the "Prague Spring" reform movement in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright was charged with inciting citizens to take part in banned 
demonstrations and with obstructing police. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was sentenced, Havel, 52, told Helena Hvalata, the presiding criminal 
court judge, that he did not feel guilty and that the charges against him were 
not proven. He suggested that the authorities will one day be forced to "open a 
dialogue with society, not excluding anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Havel defended the activities of Charter 77, the human rights declaration that 
he helped write 12 years ago, arguing that he had often warned the authorities 
that resistance to reform would lead to increased public disaffection. 
</P>
<P>
"Warning voices of this kind were not listened to," Havel said, "and today the 
present power harvests what it has sown, the fruits of its own proud attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Havel's trial took place in a courtroom on a narrow street sealed off by 
uniformed and plainclothes policemen. Representatives from international human 
rights agencies were barred, but Havel's wife, Olga, and his brother, Ivan, 
were present. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
53 Others Charged 
</P>
<P>
During his trial, 53 other defendants were facing similar charges in courtrooms 
throughout the city. Seven other leading dissidents arrested in the memorial 
demonstrations, which spread over four days beginning Jan 15, were being tried 
together, and their cases were expected to be decided today. 
</P>
<P>
The specific charges against Havel, in the view of Western diplomats and 
representatives of human rights groups gathered outside the court building, 
were virtually irrelevant. The object of the proceeding, they said, was to use 
Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident as an example to show that the 
authorities have no intention of taking part in the reforms sweeping other East 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations that led to the arrest of Havel and the others were among 
the most sustained protests in Czechoslovakia in nearly 20 years. The stern 
police response, which included the use of tear gas, water cannon and dogs, 
brought widespread shock to Czechoslovaks, who had assumed that frequent 
government references to "radical reform" meant that a measure of tolerance had 
crept into the system. 
</P>
<P>
However, the government and the Communist Party apparatus seem to be firmly in 
the hands of officials whose rise to power followed the crackdown that came at 
the end of the 1968 reform movement. Any liberalization of the system, most 
observers say, would be taken as a decisive reversal for those officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Closed Off Options' 
</P>
<P>
"They realize that any liberalization would mean the end of them," said Jiri 
Dienstbier, an opposition activist and journalist. "They have closed off any 
other options." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-line stance of the Czechoslovak party bosses has been criticized not 
only by Western-based human rights organizations but by Communist Hungary and 
Poland, where officials have argued that further delay in undertaking reform 
could worsen Czechoslovakia's economic and political situation. Recent 
high-ranking visitors from both countries, diplomatic sources have indicated, 
urged party leaders to open a dialogue with the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovak authorities, however, seem determined to hold to their 
hard-line course. Dissident activists say the authorities are concerned 
especially about containing a growing mood of discontent among young people, 18 
to 25 years old, who have no memory of the 1968 events and have grown bolder in 
their protests in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents say that of the seven activists being tried together, the harshest 
sentence may be given to Jana Petrova, 22, who has emerged as one of the young 
people's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to teach the youth a lesson," Dienstbier said. "I am afraid the 
sentences of Petrova and the others will be for the maximum." The maximum 
sentences are two years for incitement and six months for obstructing police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Laws Against Protests 
</P>
<P>
The authorities recently introduced new laws to prevent demonstrations and 
protests, including fines of up to $1,000 and jail terms for those who fail to 
heed police warnings to disperse from any event that officials feel is 
provocative. 
</P>
<P>
The bite of the new regulations was evident outside the court building where 
Havel was tried. Scores of police officers were taking the names of passers-by 
and people lingering in the street, and anyone so recorded was subject to 
arrest and prosecution if caught on the street after an initial warning to move 
on. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Charter 77 supporters managed to get into the court building early in 
the day, but they were cleared out after the court took a brief break for 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Havel was seen by only a few of them, and only for a moment, as he passed 
through a hallway dressed in jeans and a brown sweater. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Ivan, said he spoke to Havel for a few moments after the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was in a good condition and in a good mood," he said. "He said he 
was touched by the local and international support, and he said his mood from 
this was more important than the sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Havel has had frequent brushes with the authorities since the early 1970s. He 
spent nearly four years in prison, from 1979 to 1983, and since then has been a 
frequent target for police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
With his internationally acclaimed status as a playwright, he has been the 
nation's leading dissident voice and a constant thorn in the side of the 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Among his plays, generally starkly modern, are "The Temptation," which will 
open in New York this spring; "The Garden Party," and "The Memorandum."

1ST SOVIET CHAPTER OF JEWISH ORGANIZATION GETS CHARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At a meeting that would have been prohibited as "anti-Soviet" a few years ago, 
50 Jews gathered here Tuesday evening to receive their charter as the first 
chapter in the Soviet Union of B'nai B'rith, the international Jewish 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Much has changed for Jews in the last two years, and much has not," said 
Alexander S. Shmukler, one of the organizers of the Moscow chapter. "With the 
help of B'nai B'rith, we frankly hope to be able to change more." 
</P>
<P>
Horace A. Stern, a senior vice president of B'nai B'rith International, 
promised the organization's help in deepening the sense of Jewish culture, in 
combatting anti-Semitism and in assisting the emigration of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendously Exciting' 
</P>
<P>
"To be here, presenting a charter to the first B'nai B'rith chapter in Moscow, 
is a tremendously exciting and significant moment for Soviet Jews as well as 
for B'nai B'rith," Stern said. "Even a year ago, it would have been impossible, 
and I think that means a year from now other things, even more important 
things, will be possible." 
</P>
<P>
Although long vilified by Moscow as a key part of the "international Zionist 
conspiracy," B'nai B'rith sent a delegation led by its president, Seymour 
Reich, to Moscow in December for preliminary discussions with Soviet officials. 
It received permission for a second delegation this month and is planning a 
follow-up visit in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking toward the establishment of a whole range of activities, 
contacts and exchanges, including the opening of a B'nai B'rith International 
office in Moscow," said Daniel S. Mariaschin, the organization's public affairs 
director. "The window is opening here. We are not sure how wide, but we want to 
find out." 
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the B'nai B'rith chapter follows the opening this month of 
the first Jewish cultural center in the Soviet Union in more than 50 years, as 
well as formation of more than 10 Jewish cultural groups in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the first center for Jewish religious studies in more than half a 
century will open in Moscow as part of an international cultural institute 
established by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Most of the students are 
expected to study for the rabbinate under Israeli, American and other teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our B'nai B'rith chapter will draw together all Jews -- those who 
are planning to emigrate, those who have been refused (permission to leave), 
those who intend to stay and those who are uncertain," Shmukler said. "What is 
important is a sense of identity as Jews as well as an opportunity to deepen 
our understanding of Jewish culture. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Attention has been focused for a long time on those who are emigrating, and 
more than half a million have left in the past 15 or 20 years, but well over a 
million Jews remain, and intend to remain, in the Soviet Union. What of them? 
To stay, they will need a stable situation, one where they are free to live 
their lives fully as Jews if they wish, and one where there is none of the past 
anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
Through the provision of Jewish literature, tours by Jewish speakers and 
assistance in organizing seminars and other programs on Jewish themes, the 
international B'nai B'rith expects to help the new Moscow chapter, Mariaschin 
said. Help will also be offered to Jewish communities in outlying cities to 
establish their own B'nai B'rith chapters, he added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Opportunities 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow chapter hopes to draw on the long experience of B'nai B'rith's 
Anti-Defamation League in fighting anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have new opportunities under perestroika and glasnost (political reform 
and openness), but so do some strongly anti-Semitic organizations," Shmukler 
said. "The mood is such, in fact, that we cannot speak too loudly about this 
new B'nai B'rith chapter -- or we might find ourselves literally under attack. 
So, many things have changed, and others definitely have not."

ASIAN DRUG RING CRUSHED IN N.Y.; RECORD CACHE OF 838 POUNDS OF HEROIN IS SEIZED

<P>
FBI and police raids crushed a major Asian narcotics conspiracy and confiscated 
the largest cache of heroin in U.S. history -- 838 pounds, enough to supply 
half of New York City's 200,000 addicts for a year -- authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, code named Operation White Mare, culminated in 45 arrests in 
New York, Buffalo, Los Angeles, Detroit, San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, 
Singapore and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said those taken into custody included Kok Leung Woo, a 71-year-old 
prominent resident and politician in New York's Chinatown, who was charged with 
being the ring's leader and chief broker. Authorities also recovered $3 million 
in cash. The heroin was valued at $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tops French Connection Case 
</P>
<P>
"It is the largest seizure ever in the United States," Assistant FBI Director 
James Fox told a news conference in Manhattan. By comparison, about 200 pounds 
of heroin were seized when the well-publicized French Connection heroin ring 
was broken in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"This won't win the war, but it was a remarkable hit," said Richard Condon, New 
York's first deputy police commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said Woo was a leading member of Chinatown's business community, where he 
was a former member of a local Democratic club. He was arrested at his liquor 
store in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Woo "knows both suppliers of heroin in Hong Kong and Singapore, couriers who 
import the heroin into the United States and Canada, and distributors of the 
drugs in the United States," a complaint filed in federal court in Brooklyn 
charged. "He and his partner, David Kwong, bring together those suppliers and 
purchasers for the purposes of culminating substantial heroin deals." 
</P>
<P>
Kwong Chock Chiu, alias David Kwong, also was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint said the investigation began about 18 months ago with a tip from 
an informant. 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, according to the court papers, Woo and Kwong on Dec. 
8, 1987, sold an FBI undercover agent in New York about a pound of high purity 
heroin worth $35,000. On July 27, 1988, 22 kilograms of cocaine were seized in 
Detroit as a result of surveillance of Kwong and an associate. Last Oct. 2, the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police recovered six pounds of heroin from associates of 
Woo and Kwong. And on Jan. 19, 30 pounds of heroin were confiscated in Hong 
Kong from the conspiracy's suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers said from last March until the present, hundreds of 
drug-related telephone calls were intercepted in the United States, Hong Kong 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"These conversations, which are often coded, reveal a worldwide conspiracy to 
import heroin into the United States from Hong Kong and/or Singapore, utilizing 
several different methods," prosecutors charged. 
</P>
<P>
As the investigation broadened, most of the FBI's 100 Chinese-American agents 
participated. The task force was bolstered by Chinese-speaking New York 
detectives. On Monday evening, more than 100 heavily armed police and FBI 
agents raided three locations in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said after the $3 million was seized at the first location in Queens, the 
agents found 838 pounds of heroin packed in a wheelbarrow and lawn-mower tires 
at the second spot they raided. At the same time, police were conducting raids 
in Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the Southeast Asian heroin was shipped from Hong Kong to Los 
Angeles before it was sent by truck to New York for distribution to Boston and 
other Eastern cities. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate New York City is home to 200,000 heroin users, half the 
heroin addicts in the nation.

WHAT WILL BE CUT? CONGRESS ASKS BUSH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush prodded the Democratic-controlled Congress Tuesday to start 
negotiations on a compromise budget package, but key lawmakers demanded more 
details on the President's proposed cuts in domestic programs before beginning 
serious talks. 
</P>
<P>
Budget Director Richard G. Darman, appearing later before the Senate Budget 
Committee to echo Bush's plea, came under sharp Democratic attack but warned 
that a prolonged stalemate over a federal spending plan is "fraught with risk," 
adding: "Although the real economy remains strong, interest rates are rising 
and markets seem less firm than one would wish." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talks to Continue 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House Budget committees, who attended 
a White House meeting with Bush, agreed to continue private talks with Darman 
but complained that they lack the information needed to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
and chairmen and ranking Republican members of the budget, appropriations and 
tax-writing committees sat in on the hourlong talk with Bush less than two 
weeks after he submitted his $1.16-trillion revised budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), head of the Senate Budget panel, said that the Bush 
budget proposes $10-billion worth of cuts in $136-billion worth of domestic 
programs but fails to say how they should be carried out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Budget Hearing 
</P>
<P>
"Where are the cuts going to come from?" Sasser asked as his committee held the 
first Senate hearing on the Bush plan. "We don't know where the cuts are at 
this point -- the Bush Administration has yet to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
His House counterpart, Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), said after the White 
House breakfast meeting that the budget process is on the right track but 
added: "When does he (Bush) start to make the tough choices? That's part of the 
process -- to find out what the choices are." 
</P>
<P>
However, Darman would not be specific about where cuts in domestic programs 
should be made and only offered options. He said that lawmakers could accept 
former President Ronald Reagan's proposed spending level, freeze the outlays at 
the current level or negotiate with the Administration on a compromise figure. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have it both ways," Sasser told Darman. "The Administration wants a 
line-item veto but it doesn't want to give us a line-item budget." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discounts Bush Proposal 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S. C.) said that he does not regard the Bush budget 
as a serious proposal, telling Darman: "You want us to hurry up to get a 
two-year budget to get past the next election . . . . You are more 
Jack-be-nimble than Stockman." 
</P>
<P>
Hollings' reference to David A. Stockman, Reagan's first budget director, who 
acknowledged that he had manipulated budget figures on behalf of the White 
House, drew laughter from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
As for the lack of detail in Bush's plan, Hollings added: "President Bush must 
think this is a CIA covert operation." Only "dummy Democrats," he said, would 
be willing to enter budget talks with the White House on this basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Called Productive 
</P>
<P>
However, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, Sen. Pete V. Domenici 
(R-N. M.), said that the meeting with Bush was productive because "everyone 
agreed to get on with the negotiating process" rather than delay budget-making 
decisions for most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N. H.) also had an encouraging word for Darman. 
</P>
<P>
"Every budget sent up here for the past eight years has been pronounced dead on 
arrival," Rudman said. "Yours is still quivering, so I guess you're ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats heaped criticism on the President's proposal, however. Sen. Frank R. 
Lautenberg (D-N. J.) said that it called for a reduction of $1.2 billion in 
sewage construction grants, noting: "It doesn't sound kinder and gentler -- it 
sounds dirtier and harsher." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said that Bush had failed to present a bold program to 
attack the budget deficit, estimated at $170 billion for the current fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Assault on Deficit 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, he ducked," Simon said. "The danger is that we are going to do the 
same thing. I hope we don't dance at the edges of this deficit but make a real 
assault on it." 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires the deficit, as measured by the Office of Management and 
Budget, to fall below $110 billion for the fiscal year starting next Oct. 1. A 
higher figure would trigger an automatic across-the-board reduction in 
spending, divided equally between domestic programs and defense, known as a 
sequestration. 
</P>
<P>
When Sasser told Darman that some senators favor sequestration to adoption of 
the Bush budget because it would provide more total money for domestic 
programs, Darman said he favors a compromise because it would be less damaging 
to national security. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal view is that we are very, very likely to reach agreement on a 
defense reduction program that will reach the (deficit) targets," Darman said.

PANEL TO VOTE ON PENTAGON NOMINEE THURSDAY AND SENATE COULD ACT ON CONFIRMATION

With a long-delayed Senate committee vote on John Tower now set for this week, 
President Bush offered a vigorous defense of his nominee for defense secretary, 
declaring that the most recent allegations about Tower's personal life and 
financial dealings "have been gunned down" and insisting that his support for 
Tower has "never wavered." 
</P>
<P>
Bush made his comments at a press conference as members of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee reviewed the 140-page government report that the President 
said cleared Tower of recent charges and prepared to vote Thursday on whether 
to recommend his confirmation by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prompt Action Promised 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) has said that the Senate is 
"prepared to act promptly" as soon as the Armed Services Committee sends the 
nomination to the floor, and congressional sources said that a Senate vote 
could be held as early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the FBI report, sent Monday to the White House and to 
Congress, cleared Tower of charges that illegal contributions had been funneled 
to his last senatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The report included detailed interviews with persons familiar with Tower's 
drinking habits. The finding, officials said, was that the Texas senator may 
have drunk excessively in the early 1970s but has moderated his consumption 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this as a reaffirmation of what I've felt all along, and that is that 
John Tower is qualified to be secretary of defense -- he will be a good 
secretary of defense," Bush said. "I hope the Senate will move forthrightly on 
this nomination." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alcoholism Reports Denied 
</P>
<P>
Bush denied suggestions that Tower may have a continuing drinking problem -- 
the issue that Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) has 
said he finds most troubling. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence of any kind of the disease (of) alcoholism," Bush said. 
"None. None, whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and Virginia Sen. John W. Warner, the ranking Republican member of the 
panel, announced that the committee would meet in closed session once more 
before it moves to a final vote on Thursday. The White House, in an effort to 
minimize further speculation about allegations against Tower, has pressed 
lawmakers to complete their deliberations in open session. 
</P>
<P>
But Nunn said that a closed meeting is necessary in some cases to protect the 
identities of confidential informants. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll also have to try to figure out a way to do that on the floor of the 
Senate -- if (the nomination) passes the committee and goes to the floor -- and 
that's not going to be easy," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Won't Criticize Committee 
</P>
<P>
Bush on Tuesday refused to fault the Senate committee's handling of Tower's 
confirmation proceedings, which have been stalled for more than three weeks as 
Nunn and Warner called for further investigation of allegations reaching the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Nunn has) been fair," Bush said, responding to a reporter's 
suggestion that Nunn hoped to dominate defense policy by delaying the Tower 
vote. "The idea that he will run defense policy, I think he'd be the first to 
say that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
But Bush added that Nunn "will be a key player in it, and I hope that he'll be 
able to support Sen. Tower." 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the latest FBI report, Nunn refused Tuesday to discuss his 
position on the Tower nomination, saying that he would not do so until the 
committee is ready to vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Kill Nomination 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the committee will vote first on whether to recommend Tower's 
confirmation. If a majority votes no, the committee could then take a vote on 
whether or not to send the nomination to the Senate floor for a vote by the 
entire chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn's position on Tower's confirmation is believed to be critical both within 
the committee and to a Senate floor vote. Since becoming chairman of the 
committee in 1986, Nunn has had broad influence on defense matters within the 
Senate among members of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
When asked Tuesday how his handling of the Tower confirmation hearings would 
affect his working relationship with Tower if the ex-senator is confirmed, Nunn 
replied cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
"One step at a time," he said.

CAPTIVE CONDORS PRODUCE THEIR 3RD EGG IN A YEAR

A California condor at the San Diego Wild Animal Park laid an egg Tuesday, the 
third produced by captive birds since March. It came one day after an egg was 
laid by another of the endangered species at the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The newest egg was produced by condors named UN1 and AC4, the same birds 
responsible for the female chick, Molloko, from the first egg laid in captivity 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The condors here and in Los Angeles are part of a breeding program begun in 
1980 to try to replenish the species for release into the wild sometime in the 
early 1990s, said Lora LaMarca, public information director for the Los Angeles 
Zoo. There are 28 California condors in captivity, evenly divided between the 
Los Angeles and the San Diego zoos. None of the birds are believed to remain in 
the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the San Diego Wild Animal Park will determine in the next 4 to 10 
days whether the eggs are fertile. The egg laid in Los Angeles is 3 1/2 inches 
from tip to tip, white with a very faint blue-green tint, and weighs 8 1/2 
ounces.

23 MUFFLER SHOPS IN STATE CITED BY EPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that 109 muffler shops 
throughout the country are violating federal law by installing improper 
after-market catalytic converters on cars. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that violation notices totaling more than $1 million in 
proposed fines have been sent to the shops, including 23 in California. Of the 
23 California shops, 15 were identified as Midas Muffler outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the violations involved the installation of what the EPA said were 
"cheaper, less effective" two-way catalytic converters on vehicles requiring 
three-way converters. Three-way converters control emissions of nitrogen oxide 
in addition to hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide is a major ingredient in photochemical smog. It combines in 
sunlight with hydrocarbons to form ozone. 
</P>
<P>
However, Richard G. Kozlowski of the EPA's enforcement office said that the 109 
shops represent only a small percentage of the estimated 250,000 muffler 
outlets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski said three-way converters are clearly more expensive than two-way 
converters. Retail prices on a three-way could run from $20 to $50 more. But, 
Kozlowski said, shops will sell a cheaper two-way converter either to draw in 
customers in a very competitive business or to "maximize their profits." In 
other cases, he said, incorrect installations could result from honest 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of several muffler shops that were cited, as well as a senior executive 
of Midas International in Chicago, denied that there was a profit incentive for 
a shop to install a two-way instead of a three-way converter because the price 
difference is small. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that is the case. All the franchisees I spoke to said it was a 
misapplication. It was not a matter of cost," Russell Richards, senior vice 
president of franchises at Midas International, said in a telephone interview 
from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon F. Bowley, attorney for the California Midas Dealers Assn., said, "It's 
not a fair characterization that it was something installed because it was 
cheaper to install. It was an error from the manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
One Midas dealer, Albert Beattie of Palmdale, said, "I don't think any of the 
shops that did it did it intentionally." 
</P>
<P>
They added that all affected customers are being notified and that the correct 
converters are being installed at no further cost. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for one of the converter manufacturers, Car Sound Exhaust System of 
La Mirada, said there have been no errors in either the instructions or part 
numbers for several years and that mistaken installations were probably the 
fault of the shop employees. 
</P>
<P>

CLEAN AIR ACT PROPOSAL MAY EASE CITY DEADLINES, EPA CHIEF SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration, intent on drafting a Clean Air Act able to withstand 
congressional criticism, is considering easing the stringent federal deadlines 
regulating air quality in the nation's largest cities, the Environmental 
Protection Agency administrator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The changes would seek to "reconcile what is ideal with what is also 
realistic," EPA chief William K. Reilly said in an interview with The Times. At 
the same time, he said, the Administration would seek enhanced 
"carrot-and-stick" powers to increase its leverage over cities failing to 
comply with the new deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
Such a proposal would come as an effort to close the glaring gap between the 
quality of air required by law and that currently breathed by 150 million U.S. 
residents. Los Angeles air remains the nation's worst, but a new EPA study 
reported last week that ozone pollution in nearly 100 U.S. cities last summer 
violated federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA chief refused to be more specific about the changes under 
consideration, saying that a proposal has not yet been completed and that it 
will be debated at a top-level White House meeting this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important that the Administration have a unified position on 
this," Reilly said of its attempt to reauthorize the Clean Air Act. A draft 
copy of the far-reaching legislation, which President Bush has described as one 
of his top domestic priorities, is expected to be sent to Congress next month. 
</P>
<P>
Observers on Capitol Hill said that an Administration proposal to make the air 
quality standards more realistic likely would establish a sliding scale of 
deadlines permitting Los Angeles and other smog-choked cities more time for 
compliance than cities in which air pollution problems have been less severe. 
</P>
<P>
Under current law, cities have been required to comply with uniform standards 
since 1982. But the EPA, acting on an ad hoc basis, has eased deadlines for Los 
Angeles and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Clean air advocates responded cautiously to news that the Administration was 
considering revising the Clean Air standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing to focus on is how long we're going to allow cities to take and what 
kind of pressure we're going to put on them," said Blake Early of the Sierra 
Club. "If we're going to put off yet again the time at which people can breathe 
healthy air, let's have a system to provide greater assurance that we're 
eventually going to meet the goal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly's comments about the clean air proposal, in one of the first interviews 
he has granted since taking office, came as he signaled a clear intention to 
assume an outspoken role on a host of environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
Suggesting that in the past the agency was regarded improperly as merely a 
"regulatory agency," Reilly declared: "This agency, under this President, has a 
mandate to think big. And I intend to." 
</P>
<P>
As evidence, Reilly's comments on a number of occasions reached beyond 
bureaucratic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on a matter now under consideration by the Transportation 
Department, Reilly made clear his view that automobile fuel economy standards 
should be tightened. On a matter normally the purview of the Department of 
Energy, Reilly said that he plans to speak out to instill a national sense of 
"urgency" about the importance of fuel conservation. 
</P>
<P>
And on a matter that falls primarily under local authority, Reilly said that he 
hopes to "stimulate a debate" about dilemmas posed by the shrinking space 
available for waste disposal. "We can do that irrespective of the fact that our 
jurisdiction is limited," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Reilly insisted that Bush's modest budget proposal for EPA -- unchanged from 
the Reagan Administration proposal, and an 8% decline from last year's funding 
-- should not be interpreted as an indication of a lack of commitment to the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that spending proposals contained in other agency budgets -- including 
$200 million for federal land acquisition and $3.1 billion for cleanup of 
nuclear waste sites -- address important environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
But the new EPA chief ruefully acknowledged that scarcity of funding for EPA 
had caused his focus to wander. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we have no money," he said, quoting an unnamed scientist, "we have to 
think."

WALTON IS WINNER IN ARBITRATION; 
</P>
<P>
A FINAL RESOLUTION MAY TAKE YEARS -- IF CLIPPERS GO TO COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Walton officially won his arbitration hearing against the Clippers Tuesday 
for $1.6 million in deferred payments, although it could take years before the 
case is finally resolved if the National Basketball Assn. team pursues the 
matter in court. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Collins, a professor at New York University Law School, ruled in favor of 
Walton last Friday. The decision, however, was not made public until this week. 
</P>
<P>
Walton was not immediately available for comment, but Gary Vandeweghe, his 
lawyer, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Bill is realistic about litigation. He's had prior dealings with contracts 
going to court and he also spent one year in law school. . . . He understands, 
and even anticipates, some of these problems. On the other hand, I don't want 
to under-emphasize how strongly he feels about this and how strongly he 
believed this matter belonged in arbitration." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who expected to lose the ruling, disagreed. Team President Alan 
Rothenberg, who did not return phone calls Tuesday, had said previously that 
the issue was outside an arbitrator's jurisdiction and belonged in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
The National Basketball Players Assn. regards the matter a possible test case 
on the strength of its collective bargaining agreement, in which arbitration is 
the agreed-upon method of settling disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers challenged Walton's 1979 contract, saying he concealed activities 
that were detrimental to his health. In a suit filed last December in Superior 
Court in Los Angeles, they contend that "certain activities" by Walton during 
the five-year contract impaired his ability to play. Vandeweghe has said that 
the team was implying drug abuse by Walton. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeweghe said that the Clippers have already missed two payments to Walton 
worth about $30,000 each, based on attendance clauses and the number of games 
he played. Another $1.6 million is also due as part of 12 1/2 years of deferred 
payments through 1996.

ANGLERS OPERATING IN BAY AREA WATERS SEARCH FOR THE MONSTER FISH THAT TIME 
FORGOT

Capt. Mike Andrews guided his boat slowly through the morning haze to an area 
just past Benicia. This, he said, seemed the best place to carry on the search 
for one of nature's more interesting creatures, the white sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-foot sportfisher, one of a small fleet berthed beneath the Carquinez 
Bridge, was the first out. A chilling breeze nipped at Andrews' red-faced 
passengers, all regulars, who hoped this would be their lucky day. 
</P>
<P>
The smell of rain was in the air and an approaching storm's clouds were already 
competing with the rising sun. But that didn't matter. Sturgeon fishermen, 
Andrews says, are a breed apart from fair-weather anglers. 
</P>
<P>
"These same guys were out last week and it was so cold I had to wipe the ice 
off the inside of the windshield before we could even leave the dock," he said. 
"We were out one day and got hit by lightning. Everything went dark on the boat 
. . . and it's true what they say about lightning having a weird smell." 
</P>
<P>
Rain or shine, Andrews, 34, who has fished these Bay Area waters and elsewhere 
for most of his life, says sturgeon fishermen are always willing to pay $35 for 
a chance to tangle with their favorite foe. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about this living relic of a fish that commands such dedication? 
After all, it sucks mud to get food and is arguably the ugliest creature to 
inhabit these waters. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it is the largest freshwater fish in North American waters. It 
can reach nearly a ton -- some say more -- and lives for more than 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Toothless, it has an unsightly sucker of a mouth that extends and probes for 
food through the mud and sand. It plows through San Francisco Bay and through 
the delta region, through the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and anywhere 
else it cares to go. The species thrives on the West Coast from Ensenada to the 
Gulf of Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Its rubbery whiskers and an acute sense of smell guide it through the water, 
brackish or fresh, and an armor-plated back provides protection. Fish and Game 
officials say it looks much the same today as it did when it swam the primeval 
oceans and estuaries 200 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of such a catch is enough to warrant a trip under any 
conditions, Andrews' passengers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Haskin, a Santa Rosa angler who has fished for sturgeon for the last 2 1/2 
years, said he has yet to catch a keeper, which must be at least 40 inches 
long. "And I come out at least once a week," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Phillips, also of Santa Rosa, caught his first keeper recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, it was 40 3/4 inches," Haskin interrupted, indicating that Phillips' 
first keeper was just legal. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Seymour's best in two years of fishing regularly for sturgeon has been a 
36 1/2-inch fish, but Andy Maez of Concord has done significantly better -- as 
the picture in his wallet attests. It shows the 245-pound sturgeon he caught 
off nearby Roe Island in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"It jumped 20 times and took four hours to catch," he boasted. "I've caught 
several." 
</P>
<P>
And others have fared even better. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing in 1983 off a point just south of the Benicia Bridge, Joey Pallotta 
caught a world-record 468-pound sturgeon that measured nine feet and was 
estimated to be 100 years old. Pallotta said he battled the monster for four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish surfaced immediately and when I first saw it, I went into shock," he 
said. "Even if I could fight it, I didn't think there was any way we could get 
it in the boat." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than attempt that, Pallotta, in an 18-foot runabout, radioed for help. 
Tom Glakeler, in a 26-foot cruiser, responded and Pallotta, pole in hand, 
hopped aboard. 
</P>
<P>
Said Glakeler: "The fish pulled us all over the place. The third time it came 
up, it danced on its tail across the water, like a marlin." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when Bill Stratton caught a 12-foot-2, 390-pound sturgeon not far from 
Benicia, he thought at first that the bite might have been a small catfish. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said at the time that after the initial "bump," he set the hook and 
the fish immediately began to pull the houseboat he was fishing from. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I knew whatever it was, it wasn't little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sturgeon, Stratton's first keeper in 3 1/2 years of fishing for them, was a 
world record in the 30-pound-test line category. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd caught six sturgeon before, all undersize, and tossed 'em all back," he 
said. "Like most guys up here who fish for sturgeon, I was hoping to catch a 
monster. Well, I did." 
</P>
<P>
In Stafford Lake near Novato, Calif., fishermen for years told of a creature 
that dragged poles into the water and then vanished. 
</P>
<P>
The lake was eventually drained by the Marin County Water District so a dam 
could be repaired and the mystery was solved. A 6-foot-5 sturgeon lay flopping 
in the puddle that remained, a fish that officials said was between 50 and 60 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
One sturgeon caught in the Soviet Union was reported to have been 26 feet long 
and weighing 3,200 pounds. The largest recorded in California -- one caught in 
a net -- was a 12-footer that weighed 1,285 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Such fish aren't common, but enough sizable fish show up in the fish counts to 
maintain a following among Andrews' customers, who in recent weeks caught fish 
ranging from the undersized shakers -- those that you shake off the hook -- to 
the 227-pounder caught during the recent blast of Arctic air that iced Andrews' 
inner windshield. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing about sturgeon is that they're really big and they're a real 
challenge, and that's what keeps everybody going," he said. "If you just went 
by numbers, nobody would ever want to go fishing for them." 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon are known not only for their size and mystique, but for their eggs, 
from which caviar is made. For this reason alone, its history as a fishery has 
been a precarious one. 
</P>
<P>
Iranians over the years harvested the fish to dangerous levels. The rare golden 
caviar, from the noble beluga sturgeon -- indigenous to the Caspian Sea -- was 
reserved solely for the royal court of the Shah of Iran in the early 1970s and 
was served only on ceremonial occasions or presented to visiting dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Iranian caviar production has dropped significantly because of pollution and 
over-fishing -- legally and illegally. Though Iranians themselves generally 
don't like caviar -- most is exported -- sturgeon kebabs are a specialty item 
in many restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing for the giant Chinese sturgeon has been banned because dams built on 
China's Yangtze River have threatened its survival. Everything from fish 
ladders to cutting the fish open, taking the eggs, sewing it back up, and 
releasing it alive, has been tried. But the decline continues. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing for sturgeon in the San Francisco Bay area had to be halted in 1917 
because of heavy commercial fishing pressure. Gill netters fishing for salmon 
in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers caught sturgeon by the thousands, and 
many considered them pests because their armor-plated backs destroyed the nets. 
</P>
<P>
Sportfishing resumed again in 1954 with a 40-inch, one-fish limit that is still 
enforced. Stiff penalties await those who attempt to market their fish 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts are under way at UC Davis to repopulate the species through artificial 
propagation and several thousand have been released. 
</P>
<P>
Based on legal-sized fish that were tagged and recovered by the Department of 
Fish and Game, population estimates have fluctuated from 11,000 in 1954 to 
139,000 in 1984, to 84,000 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There have been transplants to inland reservoirs, with varying degrees of 
success. Lake Havasu, for instance, was planted in the late 1960s and there 
have been no signs of the fish since. On the other hand, just three years ago, 
Irvine Lake received hundreds of small sturgeon, which it bills as "the fish 
that time forgot," and several in the 10-pound range have been caught. 
</P>
<P>
Spawning doesn't occur until the fish reach about 15 years. Females spawn -- in 
this area, usually above the San Joaquin-Stanislaus River junction -- from 
February to May. 
</P>
<P>
Fertilized eggs sink to the bottom and adhere to the rocky substructure, then 
hatch in two to 10 days. Seven to 10 days later the tiny fish begin feeding on 
small invertebrates. After that, they continue to feed on herring eggs, ghost 
and grass shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews' customers, and most sturgeon fishermen, use as many grass and mud 
shrimp as they can fit on their hook, along with a sliding sinker and 40-pound 
test line. 
</P>
<P>
Rocks and twigs have also been found in sturgeons' stomachs, and a half-bushel 
of onions was found in one fish caught in Idaho's Snake River. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing in San Francisco's central bay is closed from Jan. 15 to March 15, when 
herring spawning is at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
"The herring come into the bay to spawn and the sturgeon are really attracted 
to herring eggs," Andrews said. "They are easily snagged during that time." 
</P>
<P>
A snagged fish is an illegal fish and must be thrown back. 
</P>
<P>
Though Andrews says this has been a pretty good year, no sturgeon were caught 
after the first couple of hours on this particular trip. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of rain had subsided and the inactive but impressive Glomar Explorer 
was moored in the distance. A fleet of moth-balled cargo carriers, linked 
together in rows in Suisun Bay, offered an awesome display of steel. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no sturgeon. Just plenty of sturgeon stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they get on the line they make real long runs," Andrews said. "We fought 
a 7-footer this month for an hour and 20 minutes, and we had a 95-pounder that 
took 1:45, so there are some long fights." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, still hoping to catch a keeper, told of one that got away after he 
had hooked it in five feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
"It spooled about three quarters of my line so the skipper said, 'We're going 
to have to tie a bucket on the line and throw the rod over.' I said, 'What? . . 
. are you serious?' " 
</P>
<P>
The skipper was. He tossed Phillips' rod into the water and gave chase, the 
bucket surfacing now and then until the boat caught up two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"I reeled in half my line and there it was," Phillips said. "The fish was eight 
feet long and came completely out of the water right in front of the boat." 
</P>
<P>
But it had shaken the hook and immediately disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, a gentleman hooked a 90-pounder and it looked like I was going to 
have to pull the anchor up (to give chase)," Andrews said. "Then the guy on the 
back of the boat hooked a fish similar size and his fish is going the other 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews tied a float to one and tossed it overboard, chased down the other one 
and landed it after a 40-minute fight. He then went back and located the float, 
which was attached to another 90-pound sturgeon. 
</P>
<P>
"We got both fish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, attention shifted to the boat's stern. The tip of Seymour's rod was 
dipping ever so slightly. He picked it up and gave a quick jerk to set the 
hook. Several minutes later he pulled over the rail the first sturgeon, just 
shy of 40 inches. Seymour kissed the sturgeon's tube-like mouth with both lips, 
smiled, and tossed it back into the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a superstitious thing among some of these guys," Andrews said, explaining 
that if you kiss the undersized fish before throwing them back, they will grow 
into monster fish. 
</P>
<P>
One more shaker, a kiss goodby, and the boat headed back to Crockett 
Sportfishing to prepare for the next day's outing, and more hopeful sturgeon 
fishermen. 
</P>

Australian yachtsman Iain Murray has rebutted charges that Dennis Conner was 
given inferior sails and led astray by an Australian navigator in the ANZ 
12-Meter Challenge series he lost to Murray at Sydney last month, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"That is absolute rubbish," Murray told reporter John Roberson of Fremantle, 
Australia. "The sails were divided up according to age." 
</P>
<P>
Roberson wrote that Hugh Treharne, the Australian navigator assigned to 
Conner's boat, had warned Conner to stay outside of a line to avoid running 
aground, but that Conner sailed inside the line before scraping to a halt on a 
rock. 
</P>
<P>
Conner's boat manager and crewman, Bill Trenkle, had raised the points in a 
Times article when he returned home.

Margo Adams, the former lover of Boston third baseman Wade Boggs, details 
graphic descriptions of the sex lives of several Red Sox players in an article 
that appears in the April issue of Penthouse magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who is suing Boggs for $12 million, is being paid a minimum of $100,000 
by the magazine for the story. 
</P>
<P>
In the article, Adams also accused Boggs of making racist remarks in regard to 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Al Nero, Boggs' agent, said "it's a very sick, weak attempt on Margo's part to 
hurt Wade and his teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, in a statement issued by his lawyer, Jennifer King, said: "I'm going to 
take a day and then decide if I'm going to make any kind of statement," Boggs 
said in a statement issued by his lawyer, Jennifer King.

Seoul will back a South Korean tycoon's agreement to build a resort in 
Communist North Korea -- the first inter-Korean joint venture -- Prime Minister 
Kang Young Hoon said. However, Kang hinted that the government may impose a ban 
for security reasons on proposed joint ventures to build a shipyard and a 
rail-car factory. Chung Ju Yong, founder of South Korea's giant Hyundai Group, 
said earlier this month he had signed several joint venture agreements with a 
North Korean banker -- the first since the peninsula was divided after World 
War II.

Thirty thousand people packed a stadium in Minsk, capital of the Soviet 
Byelorussian republic, in a public gathering of informal political groups, many 
of which were earlier suppressed, the official Soviet news agency Tass 
reported. The gathering was sponsored by the local government. Tass said 
participants were given the chance to speak on democratization of the political 
system, ecology, economic reform and cultural development. After several hours, 
they adopted a series of resolutions, including one demanding an end to 
nuclear-power plant construction in Byelorussia, which was contaminated by the 
1986 Chernobyl disaster.

All eight people aboard an Air Force C-141 cargo jet that crashed into a remote 
swamp on Eglin Air Force Base were presumed to have died, military officials 
said. About 100 rescuers working in heavy rain built a makeshift road and 
prepared to install a 100-foot bridge to reach the plane that crashed Monday 
night. Those believed to have perished in the crash were identified as Capt. 
Mark J. Chambers, 30; Capt. John F. Young, 30; Master Sgt. Robert E. Wright 
Jr., 37; Tech. Sgt. Ronald D. Grubbs, 29; Staff Sgt. Karl M. Kohler, 32; Airman 
1st Class Scott D. Craig, 22, and Staff Sgt. John W. Remerscheid, 33. All were 
from Norton Air Force Base in Southern California. Retired Air Force Capt. John 
Galvin of Jacksonville, Fla., who flew on a space-available basis, was 
identified as the eighth victim.

David Duke's opponent filed a court motion seeking to block the former Ku Klux 
Klan grand wizard from taking the Louisiana Legislature seat he won Saturday. 
The motion filed by home builder John Treen asks that Duke's candidacy be 
declared illegal because he lives outside the suburban New Orleans district 
that elected him. State law requires a one-year district residency by 
candidates. District Judge Clarence McManus said he was studying the request.

SLOW-GROWTH MEASURE UPSET

An Orange County judge ruled unconstitutional a slow-growth measure approved by 
San Juan Capistrano voters in November that would have banned major new 
developments. Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald found that the city's 
Measure X -- virtually identical to a countywide initiative that failed in June 
-- placed an unfair burden on future developers to correct problems with 
traffic, sewer and other public works caused by previous developments. "This 
means that the slow-growthers will finally have to recognize the limitations 
that the Constitution and state law put on their ability to restrain 
development," said Jeffrey Thomas, an attorney for developers. Leaders of the 
slow-growth movement, frustrated by what they said was the judge's 
misinterpretation of the ordinance, say they now will be forced to seek new 
options for slowing development. Among those options, they said, could be 
case-by-case referendums on major projects.

San Francisco is losing the battle against crack cocaine, according to the San 
Francisco Chronicle, which spent two months investigating the problem. Several 
city agencies are devoting a majority of their time and money to the crime, 
health and social problems created by the highly potent drug. Last year, San 
Francisco spent about $72 million battling crack, an amount that was nearly 
three times the general fund expenditure for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome, the newspaper said. Among other statistics, the newspaper found that 
61% of felony cases filed last year by the San Francisco district attorney 
involved possession or sale of the drug, and 77% of foster care cases handled 
by the Department of Social Services involved parents addicted to crack.

Poland announced it will change a monument inscription in a Warsaw cemetery 
that now blames the Nazis for killing more than 4,000 Polish army officers 
during World War II in the western Soviet village of Katyn. It cited a Radio 
Moscow report quoting a Polish Red Cross document as indicating that the 
Soviets committed the massacre. Government spokesman Jerzy Urban stopped short 
of flatly saying that the Soviets were guilty, as Western historians contend, 
and he also did not say what the new inscription will say. A committee of 
Polish and Soviet historians is evaluating the Katyn issue as part of a 
re-examination of the two countries' histories.

Israeli owners of a luxury hotel at the center of a border dispute between 
Egypt and Israel agreed to a $37-million settlement, an Egyptian official said. 
Fuad Sultan, Egypt's tourism minister, said the two countries agreed on how 
much revenue the owners of the 322-room Sonesta hotel in the Gaza Strip would 
receive, the Middle East News Agency reported. Sultan, who headed the Egyptian 
side since the talks on the issue started in Cairo on Feb. 6, said agreement 
has also been reached on future management of the hotel. However, Israel and 
Egypt are still negotiating on compensation for a tourist village on the Taba 
resort, at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba.

HOLDEN DISCOUNTS RESULTS OF POLL ON MAYOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, a long-shot mayoral candidate, reacted to a Los Angeles 
Times Poll that shows him trailing incumbent Tom Bradley by 52 points on 
Tuesday by saying that he does not believe in polls. 
</P>
<P>
Holden also declared, "If I were the mayor, we wouldn't have gangs roaming the 
streets killing people." 
</P>
<P>
Holden stepped up his campaign with a verbal broadside Tuesday, blaming Bradley 
for gangs, drugs, traffic and pollution. Holden's attack came in response to a 
Los Angeles Time poll published over the weekend that found that although Los 
Angeles residents have turned pessimistic about crime, traffic, pollution and 
housing costs, Bradley seems to have escaped blame. 
</P>
<P>
"The buck stops in the mayor's office -- and let's make no bones about that," 
Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Bradley's failures after 15 years as mayor, Holden asserted, Los 
Angeles "is not the City of Angels. It is Dodge City -- a city of death." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, Holden suggested, may be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council, in my view, does the very best job it can, given the mayor 
we have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The poll of 873 city residents gave Bradley a 67% favorable rating -- not his 
highest rating but an improvement over his 63% positive rating in August, 1987. 
If the election had been held the day of the survey, 57% said they would vote 
to reelect Bradley. Only 5% said they would vote for Holden, while 4% said they 
would vote for former newscaster and former Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Baxter Ward, the only other widely known candidate in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Holden suggested a more meaningful survey could be taken simply by walking 
through his district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Double Locks' 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the homes have bars on the windows and double locks on their 
doors. That's your poll," the councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden pointed out that if some previous political polls were right, George 
Bush would not be President and Bradley would be called "governor." 
</P>
<P>
Expanding on his crime-fighting platform, Holden used the press conference to 
announce the introduction of a motion to deploy police at six housing projects 
to help ensure "safe passage" for children between home and schools. Some 
residents have kept their children out of school because of fears of gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the mayor's campaign brushed off Holden's comments as rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
"Nate's popping off as usual," said Dee Dee Myers, spokeswoman for the 
reelection campaign. "It's typical of Nate. He's always quick to point out 
problems but never comes up with solutions. . . . That's why the mayor remains 
popular -- because he's grinding out solutions."

BOY, 13, DRAWS GUN IN CLASS, IS DISARMED BY TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ESTHER SCHRADER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old boy drew a loaded gun on a junior high school teacher Tuesday in 
a La Crescenta classroom filled with students who watched as the teacher 
wrested away the .357 magnum, officials said. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Hours earlier, the teacher, Allan Eberhard, had told the boy that he would not 
let the yearbook publish a picture showing the boy in a T-shirt with an anarchy 
symbol. Eberhard said the boy did not appear angry about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the kid, I like him and I have a million questions as to why he would 
do it," said Eberhard, faculty adviser to the yearbook. "I really don't think 
he had any intent to fire the gun." 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, was arrested at Rosemont 
Junior High School about 10:20 a.m. He was charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon and was held at Sylmar Juvenile Hall, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Deputy Pat Hunter said. Hunter said the gun belongs to the youth's parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photos Called Inappropriate 
</P>
<P>
The boy had worn a T-shirt -- printed with a letter "A" surrounded by a red 
circle -- to the school's Valentine's Day dance despite Eberhard's suggestion 
not to, Eberhard said. Eberhard said he showed the boy the photographs taken at 
the dance in a drama class early Tuesday and told him that they were not 
appropriate for the yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I wanted him to look nice," Eberhard said. "I said I wasn't going 
to use it, that we'd have to retake the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Later, as Eberhard walked into his classroom to teach a seventh-grade class, 
the youth confronted him outside, saying, "I have a surprise for you," Eberhard 
said. Eberhard said he asked the boy to leave and offered to write him a hall 
pass but the boy, wearing a long green army jacket, followed him into the room. 
</P>
<P>
As the boy leaned over his desk, he said again, "I have a surprise for you," 
Eberhard said. The teacher said he again asked the boy to leave and was about 
six feet away from the boy when the boy's coat opened to reveal a holster. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, Eberhard said the boy took the gun out of the holster. Eberhard 
said he lunged toward the boy, knocked the gun out of his hands and wrestled 
him to the floor. Eberhard said he lay on top of the boy and shouted at the 25 
students in the class to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
Eberhard said the students, silent and motionless up to that point, ran out of 
the room and to the school principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Was Nervous' 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous," said Jenny Bandaret, 13, who had been in the "Skills for 
Adolescence" class when the youth confronted Eberhard with the gun. "I was 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
Eberhard said he remained on top of the struggling boy until the school's vice 
principal came to the room and picked up the gun. 
</P>
<P>
A team of psychologists met with students at the school after the incident, 
Glendale Unified School District spokesman Vic Pallos said. Rosemont Principal 
Lois Neil said she wrote a letter to parents explaining the incident. She said 
students were given the letter to take home at the end of the day.

SUSPECT IN FATAL BEATING KILLS HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man barricaded in his girlfriend's La Mirada apartment apparently killed 
himself Tuesday after refusing to surrender to deputies investigating the fatal 
beating of the woman, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the sheriff's Special Weapons Team stormed the apartment about 10 
a.m. and found the man dead in the kitchen and the woman dead in the living 
room, Deputy Van Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear how the man committed suicide, but investigators 
believe his girlfriend had been beaten to death during an argument. Their names 
were withheld until relatives could be notified. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies at the Norwalk sheriff's station were first alerted to the incident 
about 7 a.m. when the woman's 13-year-old daughter called and said her mother 
had been hurt in a fight with her boyfriend in the apartment in the 11500 block 
of Santa Gertrudes Avenue.

TALENT SCOUT GUILTY IN SEXUAL ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood talent scout pleaded guilty Tuesday to sexually assaulting two 
women he lured to his office through newspaper ads seeking models. 
</P>
<P>
Ross Washington, 56, pleaded guilty in Superior Court to one count each of rape 
and rape with a foreign object. Sentencing for Washington, who remains in 
custody, was scheduled March 17, when he could be sent to state prison for up 
to 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who lived in Marina del Rey, sexually assaulted two women in his 
Sunset Boulevard office after attracting them with newspaper ads, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Steve Sitkoff said. He raped one of the women Jan. 14, 1988, during a 
photography session in which he asked her to pose in bathing suits and men's 
shirts, and sexually assaulted another women under similar circumstances on 
June 3, 1987, Sitkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington operated four firms out of the same Sunset Boulevard address: Ross 
Washington Productions, Hollywood Career Center, Ross Elite Model Management 
and Starmaker International. He also operated the Miss West Coast Beauty 
Pageant, held at the Disneyland Hotel in August, 1987.

COUNTY EMPLOYEES TO GET 'WANTED' LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noting the success of television shows such as "America's Most Wanted," Los 
Angeles County officials announced Tuesday that photographs and descriptions of 
wanted criminals will be circulated among county employees. 
</P>
<P>
The county's 75,000 employees will receive the new Crime Alert Bulletin every 
other month as part of the County Digest, the official publication for county 
employees, Supervisors Ed Edelman and Mike Antonovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, the city of Los Angeles has been mailing similar bulletins to its 
38,000 employees. The program was initiated by City Controller Rick Tuttle, who 
acknowledged he borrowed the idea from "America's Most Wanted," the weekly Fox 
Television series. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Barbara Guarino said the city program has generated several leads 
from employees and other members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
The first arrest stemming from the program occurred recently when authorities 
located Abdulmalik Abdullahi Kurtu, a former parking lot attendant at Los 
Angeles International Airport who was wanted for embezzling receipts.

COMPUTER NETWORK DEBUTS WITH DELUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Hall in Santa Monica was swamped with calls Tuesday from more than 150 
people eager to register for the city's new computer network. 
</P>
<P>
The network, hailed as an innovative way to connect the public with its 
government, enables Santa Monica residents to use their personal computers to 
plug into a wealth of information on city events and issues. 
</P>
<P>
Users of the network can sign on to read City Council reports and agendas, find 
out how to get a building permit and see what books are available in the 
library. A resident who is hooked up can computer-message complaints or 
comments into City Hall and expect an answer, right on his or her computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
The system went "on line" as scheduled Tuesday, and the first member of the 
public to become a user signed on shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hill, a neighborhood activist credited with first suggesting the idea 
to city leaders, "accessed" the system and found a message awaiting him from 
Information Systems Director Ken Phillips: 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome aboard," the message said. "I hope you find it useful." 
</P>
<P>
Hill then whipped off a couple of messages to Phillips and City Manager John 
Jalili, congratulating them on their work.

CITY TOSSES 2 EXTRA PLAY HOURS TO DOGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted Tuesday to give dogs two extra hours each day to romp 
without leashes through Laurel Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 14 to 0 to extend the hours that pet owners may run their 
dogs without leashes at the park on Mulholland Drive above Studio City, the 
only facility in the city in which dogs are allowed to run free. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of Councilman Michael Woo, the council gave dogs and their 
owners an extra hour in the morning and afternoon -- meaning that the park now 
goes to the dogs from dawn to 10 a.m. and from 3 p.m. until dark.

45 ILLEGAL ALIENS DISCOVERED IN HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty-five illegal aliens, including a 2-month-old baby, were discovered inside 
a filthy, sparsely furnished house in Valinda on Tuesday, shortly after an East 
Los Angeles woman told authorities that her sister was being held for ransom 
inside the home. 
</P>
<P>
The tip led officers to a one-story frame home in the 18400 block of Hurley 
Street about 12:30 a.m., sheriff's deputy Van Mosley said. Inside, deputies 
discovered the immigrants from Central and South America who had, for an 
unknown number of days, shared a five-room house that has a single bathroom and 
is furnished with mattresses, chairs and a television set. 
</P>
<P>
"It is believed that all of them arrived in the U.S. within the last week," 
said Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were alerted to the home after a woman called the station saying that 
her sister, a Salvadoran immigrant, was being held captive inside the house, 
Mosley said. Officials discovered the woman, Maria Zuniga, 40, along with other 
illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador, said 
Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said Tuesday's raid led to the second such discovery in 
Valinda, a Los Angeles County community 28 miles east of Los Angeles, in less 
than two months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Patrol of Border 
</P>
<P>
Harold Ezell, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Western regional 
commissioner, said the California border will be "very aggressively" patrolled 
to stop any increase in illegal immigration by Central Americans fleeing a 
clampdown in Texas. California and Florida are the primary destinations for the 
flood of immigrants coming into the United States through Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Central Americans seeking asylum face arrest and deportation in 
Texas if their applications are denied under a new get-tough policy that seeks 
to send economic refugees home instead of giving them work permits while their 
requests are processed. 
</P>
<P>
Asserting an absolute "right to control our borders," Ezell said at a news 
conference that "economic refugees" will not fare any better at the California 
border. He also said he does not expect any increase of asylum applicants in 
either Los Angeles or at the California border. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to stand back and let our borders be overrun," Ezell said. 
"The message has to get down to Central America that you can't use this 
(asylum) to get into America." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 8, the immigration service started interviewing asylum applicants on 
the day they applied, before granting work permits. Until then, employment 
authorization was granted for up to a year without an assessment of the 
applicant's request. 
</P>
<P>
The number of applications surged last summer to 500 a day, Ezell said, but 
have dropped to about 100 since the new policy began. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the immigrants detained Tuesday were held for Border Patrol officers, 
and Zuniga was taken into protective custody. She told deputies that she had 
been held for $1,400 ransom. Although sheriff's deputies were uncertain whether 
others in the house had also been held captive, immigration officials said such 
ransom demands are common. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, smugglers will increase the price after escorting aliens across the 
border; and their families, who are expected to pay, sometimes contact police. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Way Station" 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Geer, head agent in charge of the San Clemente Border Patrol station, 
said the residence was probably a "drop house, a way station where aliens are 
placed until (their smugglers) can farm them out to wherever they're going." 
</P>
<P>
The house's front door, the lock of which was broken, led into a front room 
littered with beer cans, a few blankets and a baby food jar tossed next to two 
dirty mattresses. A baby's shirt lay near a television set, the only furniture 
in the room besides a wooden chair, lamp and water cooler. 
</P>
<P>
No suspected smugglers are in custody.

The Long Beach real estate broker who was shot to death and stuffed into the 
trunk of her car appears to have been killed in the office of a rival broker, 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach police Tuesday were seeking a warrant for the arrest of the broker, 
Vicente Lapid OCampo, but said the suspect may have fled to his native 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Police now believe that Arlene Lee Chee, 46, of Seal Beach was killed in the 
Realty One office owned by OCampo, 45, a former employee of Chee, Long Beach 
Police Detective Ron Pavek said.

"We found evidence that led to that conclusion," Pavek said. He declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Chee's body was found last Thursday night in the trunk of her 1985 
Mercedes-Benz a few blocks from OCampo's office on West Willow Street in Long 
Beach. Family members said Chee did not return home Wednesday night and, after 
searching for her Thursday, they found her car on 25th Street near Fashion 
Avenue. They called police, who opened the trunk and discovered the body. 
</P>
<P>
Family members told police that Chee had a noon appointment with OCampo on 
Wednesday. OCampo was last seen Wednesday afternoon, and his lawyer said he has 
not contacted family members. 
</P>
<P>
"Our client has not contacted us," said Leonard Matsuk, OCampo's lawyer. 
"Nobody's heard from him. His wife hasn't heard from him." 
</P>
<P>
Police said OCampo may have been angry with Chee because she recently hired one 
of his agents, who police identified as Corine Bolden. Bolden, who began 
working for Chee last week, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
OCampo was one of Chee's first employees when she opened her Century 21 Fortune 
office in the 2500 block of Pacific Avenue in Long Beach in 1982. Chee fired 
OCampo that same year and he set up his own real estate firm 
</P>
<P>
According to the state Department of Real Estate, OCampo's license was to be 
suspended for 30 days beginning Tuesday but he arranged to pay a $2,500 fine 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
The state determined that OCampo had handled a deal negligently, a spokeswoman 
for the Department of Real Estate said. In an action related to the same deal, 
OCampo was ordered to pay $3,500 to a family that had filed the complaint.

BERNARDI WANTS CITY VOTE ON USE OF $4.25 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi wants to hear from the voters on 
how Los Angeles should spend $4.25 billion in projected downtown property tax 
revenues -- money that Mayor Tom Bradley wants to spend, in part, on coping 
with the problems of housing shortages and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, long a critic of the mayor's and the Community Redevelopment Agency's 
hold over millions in redevelopment funds, moved Tuesday to put the 
$4.25-billion question on the city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he would seek cooperation with the mayor's office in preparing 
the advisory measure, which requires council approval and probably would not be 
ready until the June, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Running Dispute 
</P>
<P>
The effort is aimed at resolving a long-running dispute over who should control 
future tax-increment revenues generated by downtown redevelopment. Under a 1977 
court settlement, a ceiling of $750 million was placed on CRA spending -- a 
figure that is expected to be reached by 1997 or before. The mayor and the CRA 
are trying to persuade a judge to raise the limit to $5 billion. That money 
would be collected and spent over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The citywide vote being pushed by Bernardi would be a non-binding referendum on 
whether the limit should be lifted or left as is, in which case future revenues 
would come under the control of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley is pushing an agenda that, with the ceiling raised, calls for the CRA 
to spend half the money on continuing downtown redevelopment -- including 
additions to downtown's skyline, a gentrified residential area and restored 
historic areas. The other half would be used to build affordable housing and to 
finance an after-school program that Bradley touts as the key to keeping youths 
out of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Cannot Agree' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't question Mayor Bradley's concern for the city's housing crisis," 
Bernardi said. "But I cannot agree that we should give the CRA $2.2 billion in 
property taxes over the next 20 years to build more high-rise buildings 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
If the ceiling remains in place, Bernardi said, the city and county can still 
use tax money to pay for housing and anti-gang programs, and will also have 
more money to hire police officers and keep trauma care facilities open.

Rescuers used bulldozers and bridge-building equipment in an attempt to reach a 
wrecked Air Force cargo plane in a swamp on Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, 
but came no closer to learning the fate of the eight people aboard. The 
four-engine C-141B jet based at Norton Air Force Base near San Bernardino 
crashed and burned four miles north of Hurlburt Field, part of the base, in 
Florida's panhandle Monday while on its landing approach. Seven crew members 
from Norton were on board, along with a military retiree who boarded during a 
refueling stop in Colorado, officials said.

TEEN CLUB TAKES SOBER VIEW OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The line starts forming at 8:15 p.m. There are pale, short-haired boys wearing 
baggy pants with white socks, and bright-eyed girls in black leather 
miniskirts. 
</P>
<P>
As they reach the front of the line, each submits to a search. Holding their 
arms straight up, the boys are patted down by a security man wearing a two-way 
communications headset, while the girls open their purses for examination. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately inside the door, an electronic message board spits out red letters 
informing the entrants of house rules. "No drugs, no alcohol, no weapons, no 
bangers," the machine says, using a slang word referring to gang members. Then, 
evoking the name of a device traditionally associated with doctors, but in 
recent years favored by youthful drug dealers, the machine says, "Oh yeah, I 
almost forgot. No beepers. What are you, a brain surgeon"? 
</P>
<P>
It is Saturday night at Jets, Long Beach's only teen-age nightclub and one of a 
handful in Southern California. The club's purpose, according to its owners, is 
twofold: to give youths a place to party hard on Friday and Saturday nights in 
a drug- and alcohol-free environment and to provide a good living for its two 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friends Lost to Drugs 
</P>
<P>
So far, they say, it is succeeding wildly on the first count and just barely on 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd lost three of my friends to drugs before I was 16," said co-owner Craig 
(Jet) Sutter, 25, for whom the club is named. "What we're doing here is showing 
kids that they can have fun without (drugs and alcohol)." 
</P>
<P>
Adds his partner, Karl Kamb, also 25: "There's nothing to do here but dance, 
drink Coke and eat candy. It's as innocent as a Little League snack bar." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the club is the product of a friendship between the two men that dates 
back to when they were not much older than Little Leaguers. Born and raised in 
Malibu, they were fast friends through most of their childhood and adolescent 
years. Later they pursued separate careers -- Kamb into the car business and 
Sutter into a career in nightclubs. 
</P>
<P>
For six years, Sutter said he worked at a club for young adults in Santa 
Monica, first as a disc jockey and finally as manager. Surrounded by drugs and 
alcohol, he developed a drinking problem himself. And although he was able to 
eventually get the help he needed to curb it, Sutter said, the experience 
motivated him to want to help others. 
</P>
<P>
So two years ago, when the club in Santa Monica closed, throwing Sutter out of 
work, he sought out his old friend Kamb and asked him whether he would like to 
go into the teen-age nightclub business. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a lot of kids who are literally destroying their lives," Sutter said. 
"They have absolutely no future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unemployment Problem 
</P>
<P>
By providing an environment that is both hip and safe, he figured, he could not 
only solve his own unemployment problem but do his bit to help curb teen-age 
drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Kamb liked the idea enough to sink $250,000 into it from his savings, a loan 
from his mother and the sale of his house, car and motorcycle. It was with that 
seed money that the pair leased and renovated the 17,200-square-foot building 
in downtown Long Beach that is now Jets. 
</P>
<P>
After opening a year ago, Kamb said, the new club, which operates only on 
Fridays and Saturdays, was attracting about 100 customers a night. Today, he 
said, it averages 500 teen-agers on each of the two nights, still less than 
half capacity. The owners attribute the significant increase to word-of-mouth 
and an ambitious publicity campaign in which Jets deejays preside over 
lunchtime dances at various area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Unified School District officials say they applaud the idea of a 
non-alcoholic nightclub for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great," said Edward M. Eveland, assistant superintendent for 
secondary education. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt last year to sponsor a series of Friday night drug- and alcohol-free 
dances at Wilson High School had to be temporarily curtailed, he said, after 
the appearance of "riff raff from all over the city . . . who were not looking 
for fun but trouble." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, he said, the drinking and carousing outside the dance caused 
police to be summoned to avoid a violent confrontation. Since then, according 
to Wilson High officials, the dances have been resumed with tighter security 
that has eliminated the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm behind any kind of activity that is closely supervised and provides a 
place where kids can go for entertainment, other than wandering the streets or 
attending (unsupervised) parties," Eveland said, referring to Jets, which is 
supervised by a staff of young adults. "I think we need more of them." 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate its 15- to 21-year-old patrons, the nightclub features two 
separate dance floors, each with its own sound system and deejay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Themes 
</P>
<P>
One caters to lovers of what Kamb calls "top 40s" hits and "ethnic funk," such 
as rap music. The other, equipped with a smoke machine and floor-to-ceiling 
mirrors, is for more bizarre tastes. On Friday nights, its deejays play 
something called "ska" -- a reggae beat favored by "mods" whose style, 
according to Kamb, is patterned after the British subculture of the early 
1960s. And on Saturday nights the space is taken over by "death rockers," 80% 
of whom, he says, wear black. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the kids that the neighbors look at and say, 'My God, it's Satan,' " 
Kamb explained. "Actually, they are just ordinary kids into a certain type of 
music." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, he said, the club will add a third dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Each type of music suits a particular type of kid," Kamb said. "They're very 
picky about what they listen to. (The different groups) are like oil and water; 
they don't mix." 
</P>
<P>
While admission is $7 at the door, he said, a $2 discount is given to members 
of Alcoholics Anonymous and other drug- or alcohol-treatment programs, of which 
the club gets many. And although Jets is finally making a small profit, Kamb 
said, the profit is still too marginal to have made a dent in his $250,000 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my life," said Kamb, who three weeks ago quit his car sales job to 
manage the club full time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clothing Rules 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers seem to like the place, despite its many rules, including those 
forbidding clothing such as baseball caps and white T-shirts, articles that 
have become trademarks of certain gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty safe," said Jenna Mitchell, 17, of Long Beach. "We get tired of 
going to the movies all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Said David Cowan, also 17, a Buena Park resident who said he is enrolled in an 
Orange County drug-abuse program: "I come here regularly. It keeps me sober." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was overjoyed at the scene on a recent Saturday night, however. 
Allison MacBeth, 18, of Yorba Linda, for instance, said she was disappointed at 
the deejay's choice of music. 
</P>
<P>
"It was advertised as Mean Gothic but really it's New Wave," she complained. 
"We (Mean Gothic lovers) don't have any place to go anymore. It's annoying."

A BALANCHINE BREAKTHROUGH IN THE CITY OF HIS BIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until now, the ballets of George Balanchine have been contraband in the Soviet 
Union, performed privately -- and illegally -- if at all. Finally, thanks to a 
Los Angeles-born woman, Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" was at last 
performed Tuesday night at the Kirov Theatre in the city where Balanchine was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
Francia Russell, co-artistic director of Seattle's Pacific Northwest Ballet, 
sits at breakfast in her Leningrad hotel the morning of the Kirov dress 
rehearsal for "Theme." 
</P>
<P>
She was invited by the Kirov to stage the well-known neoclassic ballet to music 
by Tchaikovsky and to teach Balanchine technique. That has not been easy. And, 
on this day, only two days before the premiere, with a great deal of work left 
to be done, she shakes her head at the wonder of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Balanchine was the greatest choreographer of the 20th Century," she begins. 
"He was a product of the Kirov's school (before the company was named the 
Kirov), and was a dancer with the Kirov, but his ballets have never been 
performed here. Even China had his ballets before the Soviet Union," she says. 
(Russell set those pieces on the Shanghai Ballet). 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union is the last country with a ballet tradition -- in fact, it's 
the last country with an active ballet company -- to do Balanchine ballets." 
</P>
<P>
Her wonder at how this country could turn its back on its prodigious son is no 
less than that of the Kirov artistic director, Oleg Vinogradov. Why weren't 
Balanchine's works performed in the Soviet Union? 
</P>
<P>
"It was idiotic," says Vinogradov, refusing to mince words in this new era of 
glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
"His art was considered Western, and if it was Western, than it must be 
negative," he says, describing the official thinking of the past. It is not a 
thinking he subscribes to now, if he ever did. 
</P>
<P>
At present, Vinogradov is in the vanguard of the movement to challenge all 
official interference in the arts. Only three weeks ago, he "courageously," 
according to Russell, brought back Kirov defector Natalia Makarova to dance on 
the Kirov stage. 
</P>
<P>
She was the first defecting ballet star to do so, but not the last. Vinogradov, 
much to the consternation of those who consider the defectors traitors, has 
also invited back former Kirov dancers Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rudolf Nureyev. 
And in June he will lead his company on a multi-city tour of North America 
where the Balanchine works will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
But after generations of only one way of doing things -- the official, 
no-suggestions-are-welcome way -- it is difficult for the Kirov dancers to 
adapt to the newly permitted challenges, no matter their excitement at doing 
something new. 
</P>
<P>
And even more difficult for Russell to attempt to teach them movements they 
have never seen and never tried or a method of learning that requires constant 
attention, vigilance and effort. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Western dancers, Soviet members of a ballet company are employed for 
life, Russell explains. They are paid regardless of whether they dance. They 
grow up in a society that spoils them. 
</P>
<P>
Former stars become personal coaches to the up-and-comers, "pampering them, 
threatening them and watching out for their careers," Russell says. In short, 
they are not used to working quickly -- or working hard -- to learn a ballet. 
And the Kirov is no different from any other Soviet institution. Nothing is 
organized; everything takes time. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, last September when she first arrived to start working with the 
corps, Russell found herself facing hostile ballerinas who could not believe 
she would want them to start rehearsing on pointe when the actual performances 
were months away. In a tradition that gives dancers all the time in the world 
to rehearse ("unlike America, where time is money," Russell says), the corps 
could not get serious about their roles that far in advance. 
</P>
<P>
And in a company of more than 200 dancers, Russell says she never knew whose 
face would turn up in rehearsal from one week to the next, though she had been 
given carte blanche from Vinogradov to choose the dancers she wanted. When she 
left at the end of her first month there, to say the dancers were not prepared, 
was a "gross understatement," she says. 
</P>
<P>
To try her patience further, Russell found herself combating an exasperating 
tradition in Soviet ballet: the worship of male dancers. In a society 
chauvinistic at all levels, and especially about ballet, the male dancers were 
appalled to be instructed first by an American, when they consider themselves 
as the leaders in ballet, and second by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that Russell's credentials to do so are outstanding. She studied 
under Balanchine, was a soloist with his New York City Ballet, later becoming 
ballet mistress of the company. Since then she has staged more than 90 
productions of his works throughout the world, at the same time acting as 
co-artistic director for Pacific Northwest Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Sunday's sold-out dress rehearsal that had the audience standing 
in the aisles screaming "bravo" at curtain call after curtain call, proves she 
has won out. (Balanchine's "Scotch Symphony," as staged by Suzanne Farrell, was 
also danced on this program.) 
</P>
<P>
The Kirov traditionally dances at what Western dancers call "half tempo," 
providing time to lead up to each step, something not permitted in a Balanchine 
work where, says Russell, "there is a great emphasis on speed. He wanted ballet 
bigger, faster, with more of everything. He broke barriers." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this rehearsal, however the dancers, coaches and pianist seem to 
contrive only to break Russell's "barriers." The dancers' usual coaches take 
advantage of the fact Russell does not speak Russian -- though she speaks 
French, German and English -- to interrupt her French instructions to the 
dancers, shouting out their unasked-for input in Russian. Their proteges answer 
back in Russian. What the orders are and what the answers are remain a mystery 
to Russell. No one explains. No one apologizes. 
</P>
<P>
Russell calls for the translator and takes a deep breath. Then, ignoring 
interruptions, carries on with her instructions to the dancers both in French, 
and with the aid of the translator when necessary, in Russian. Midway through 
the rehearsal, through sheer professional stamina, she has managed to relegate 
the other coaches to the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a brilliant move of diplomacy, she calls one of the coaches over, 
showing him what she is trying to teach the dancers. The coach instantly takes 
up her instructional point, chastising the dancers for not following her 
direction. It is a small victory in a day when she never knows what will happen 
next, whom she will be working with or what the dancers are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest obstacle she has had to overcome is the fact the Kirov dancers 
have never been exposed to Balanchine. 
</P>
<P>
"Balanchine is abstract. They're used to story ballets. Classics are in their 
bones," she explains. "It's like stripping naked and going out there on stage; 
it's so unfamiliar. For Americans to do something new is stimulating and 
normal. Here it's not and they're filled with fright." 
</P>
<P>
In fact the lead dancers have all confessed that when they started to rehearse 
that they would not be able to do it. Says Zaklinsky, who was to dance the 
premiere with his wife, Altynai Assylmuratova: "There were moments when I was 
sure I wouldn't succeed. I had to make myself do it." 
</P>
<P>
Agrees the exotic looking Assylmuratova, at a party thrown by the American 
Consulate here after the dress rehearsal on Sunday, "Balanchine provides you 
with a new job for your legs." (Zaklinsky and Assylmuratova will be dancing as 
guests with American Ballet Theatre in Los Angeles early in March, though not 
in any Balanchine ballet.) 
</P>
<P>
After the success of the dress rehearsal, Russell is beginning to reconsider 
her decision not to set Balanchine's "Firebird" on the Kirov, as she has been 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my own company to get back to, so in September I said no, but now I 
feel better about doing it," she confesses. "Maybe."

SLOW-GROWTH STATUTE HELD UNCONSTITUTIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE STRIKES DOWN SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO LAW, RULING THAT IT PUTS UNFAIR BURDEN 
ON BUILDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County judge Tuesday struck down as unconstitutional a slow-growth 
measure approved by San Juan Capistrano voters that would have banned any major 
new developments in the city until existing public works needs are met. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge William F. McDonald found that the city's Measure X placed 
an unfair burden on future developers to solve problems with traffic, sewer and 
other public works facilities caused by previous developments. The initiative 
was narrowly approved by city voters last November after a nearly identical 
countywide plan failed at the ballot box last June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Legal Setback 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's decision dealt Orange County slow-growth advocates their second 
major legal setback in recent months. Last October, a judge rejected a similar 
San Clemente ordinance that also was approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that the slow-growthers will finally have to recognize the 
limitations that the Constitution and state law put on their ability to 
restrain development," said Jeffrey Thomas, an attorney representing one of two 
developers who joined with the Building Industry Assn. to fight the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the slow-growth movement, frustrated by what they contend was the 
judge's misinterpretation of the ordinance, said Tuesday that they now will be 
forced to seek new options for slowing development. Among those options, they 
said, could be case-by-case public referendums on major projects. 
</P>
<P>
"This is frustrating, but we're not going to be set back by mere legal 
technicalities," said Thomas C. Rogers, an architect of the countywide 
slow-growth measure and president of Citizens for Slow Growth and Traffic 
Control. "We just go back to the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano officials, who found themselves legally bound to defend in 
court a measure that they have criticized, said they had expected the 
initiative to be overruled. No decision was made Tuesday on a possible appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm personally glad that Measure X has been dealt this blow because I don't 
think it would have done the city any good," Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said. "It 
did nothing to really manage the volume of growth." 
</P>
<P>
By a margin of just 3 percentage points, voters in San Juan Capistrano were 
among several local communities last November to approve slow-growth measures 
aimed at meeting current and future demands on roads, sewers, parklands, police 
and fire protection, and other community resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Set Requirements 
</P>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano initiative would have required that a certain threshold 
of improvements to existing public works be met before any new developments 
could begin. 
</P>
<P>
No funding mechanism for such improvements was spelled out in the measure. But 
building industry representatives have said that the measure would, in effect, 
have forced developers of future projects to assume much or all of the cost of 
these expensive improvements -- even if they weren't the ones who created the 
problem in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough for the landowner to eliminate any negative impact of the 
development on these (public works) facilities" under the measure, attorneys 
for Kaiser Development Co. argued in opposing the plan. "He must also improve 
on the situation which existed before he began to develop his own land." 
</P>
<P>
But attorneys for the city, defending the measure before Judge McDonald in 
Santa Ana Tuesday, said they only want to see developers pay their "fair share" 
for placing increased demand on local resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Health and Safety Cited 
</P>
<P>
"A local municipality historically has always had the right to control local 
development to protect health and safety," attorney Daniel K. Spradlin, 
representing the city, told McDonald. He added that the measure "doesn't impose 
the cost exclusively on the developers." 
</P>
<P>
But Judge McDonald asked Spradlin skeptically: "Isn't (the developers') fair 
share zero?" He said it was unreasonable to expect developers to pay for new 
roads and other improvements to meet already-existing needs. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, citing Superior Court Judge John C. Wooley's rejection last October 
of San Clemente's slow-growth initiative, called the San Juan Capistrano 
measure defective. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Hausdorfer said the decision now allows the city to review a backlog of 
about 50 proposed projects for compliance with earlier city ordinances 
regulating growth. The projects had been on hold after the voters' November 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad a decision has been made. Now we need to settle down and plan for the 
future because (the measure) has caused a great deal of confusion," the mayor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the largest tracts for potential development may be those held by the 
firms that successfully blocked Measure X in court. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser Development holds title to the 17-acre Rosan Ranch in the south end of 
the city, on a hilltop parallel to Camino Capistrano, while Verde San Juan 
Estates General Partnership owns four residential lots on Toyon Drive in the 
hills above Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Have to Narrow Sights 
</P>
<P>
Slow-growth advocate Rogers said the second court defeat for a ballot 
initiative may force slow-growth forces to narrow their sights in future 
battles. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Building Industry Assn. (an opponent of the initiative) insists 
on fighting this thing in court ad nauseum, then the citizens, to defend 
themselves, are going to have to look to a simpler solution," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers said that may mean abandoning broad policy statements as sought in the 
ballot initiatives and, instead, putting specific development proposals to the 
voters. That was the case in Cypress, where voters last week rejected the 
proposed Cypress Downs project on the Los Alamitos Race Course grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But Rogers predicted that Tuesday's court defeat "will make us more determined 
than ever." 
</P>
<P>
Spradlin, the lawyer who represented the city in pushing to implement Measure 
X, agreed. "This decision is certainly a discouraging word, but it's not the 
last word," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
The intense demand on local roads, sewer systems and other public works, 
Spradlin said, "is not a problem that's going to go away if we stick our heads 
in the sand."

GIFT OF GAB: SLAIN WOMAN'S CHOICE FOR PROTECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS and HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robbyn Panitch decided not to buy a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Through her doors each day came the desperate and delusional, transients with 
private demons. 
</P>
<P>
It was dangerous but rewarding work for the 36-year-old Los Angeles County 
mental health worker. 
</P>
<P>
But at 5 feet, 2 inches, the only protection the red-haired Panitch had was a 
touch of fearlessness and a gift of gab. 
</P>
<P>
"Robbyn could carry on a conversation with a telephone post," said Dr. Randall 
Firling, a psychiatrist for the County Homeless Outreach Program, who worked 
with Panitch for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"She would start talking to people that, quite, frankly, I wouldn't know how to 
approach," he recalled. "She really didn't have any kind of fear." 
</P>
<P>
But a gun to protect herself from those needing help? No, she told relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"She had decided that she couldn't do that because she was in the business of 
trying to help people," said Mark Panitch, her 42-year-old brother from Yakima, 
Wash. "She said if she had to be afraid of the people she was dealing with, she 
should not be doing this." 
</P>
<P>
What she wanted, said her family, was added security provided by the county, 
but funding cutbacks made that impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"She had talked to me several times, saying how she had gone to her supervisors 
and asked for some kind of protection," Mark Panitch said, "but they told her 
they county couldn't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, a 26-year-old drifter with a 3-inch knife walked into the Santa Monica 
clinic where Robbyn Panitch worked and stabbed her to death. Panitch's screams 
alerted co-workers, who captured her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
As news of the killing spread through the mental health community, relatives 
and friends drew on the emotions of the day and recalled the woman they knew. 
</P>
<P>
At their house in Palos Verdes Estates, her parents, Allan and Gloria Panitch, 
recalled their daughter as a compassionate, loving person. 
</P>
<P>
"She liked to work with people," Gloria Panitch said only hours after the fatal 
attack, her eyes red with tears. "That is what she did -- what she was." 
</P>
<P>
Her father, pacing, interjected: "It's ironic that one of the people she was 
trying to help would do this." 
</P>
<P>
Panitch, a Democratic Party activist, said politics was partly to blame for his 
daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
The father contended that Republican-inspired budget cutbacks led to a lack of 
security at county mental health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to Proposition 13," he said. "It goes back to (Gov. George) 
Deukmejian. It goes back to (former President Ronald) Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
Continuing to pace, Panitch added: "They have to kill your daughter; they have 
to kill your baby for people to realize what's happening. . . . How was I going 
to know that my daughter was going to be sacrificed at the budget altar?" 
</P>
<P>
As they spoke, Panitch's fiance, Tom Flaherty, arrived and embraced the 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what you get when you have no funding," he said bitterly, referring to 
recent county cutbacks in mental health funding. "This guy has been running 
around the street. It could have been you, but it was her." 
</P>
<P>
Robbyn Panitch spent most of her childhood in Van Nuys. She attended high 
school in Palo Alto after the family moved there. Her father is a contract 
manager at Hughes Aircraft and her mother is a marriage and family counselor. 
</P>
<P>
After doing civil rights work in the 1970s, she attended Mills College in 
Oakland and later received two master's degrees -- one from USC in social work 
and another in Jewish communal studies at Hebrew Union College. She played the 
flute. 
</P>
<P>
Panitch chose psychiatric social work, her brother said, because "she was 
really concerned about people who had been dealt a low hand by society. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very dedicated to the idea that everybody deserved a decent shake from 
society, and she felt that what she was doing was a way of personally helping 
to put her ideals into practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked With Homeless 
</P>
<P>
On the streets of the South Bay area, where she had worked for more than a 
year, former colleagues recalled Panitch as a dynamo in working with the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times I told her she should be more careful," Firling said. 
</P>
<P>
She also helped troubled inmates in County Jail and at Sybil Brand Institute 
for Women, becoming friendly along the way with many people in the Sheriff's 
Department. Her fiance works in medical services for the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother said Panitch took part in the county's mobile psychiatric response 
team. She was among the mental health workers who responded to 911 emergency 
calls involving people acting strangely. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother said Panitch had been attacked several times by these people, only 
recently returning to work after back and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Santa Monica, Panitch was recently transferred to her hometown to 
work at the county's Santa Monica West Mental Health Clinic, a pale brick 
two-story structure in a quiet, tree-lined area dotted with apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Mitchell, acting district chief of the facility, said Panitch was eager 
to work with the caseload of transient mentally ill when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"She asked to come," Mitchell said. "When she talked to us, she saw it as an 
opportunity to work with the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Among her tasks at the clinic were manning the "cold weather shelters" where 
transients go for treatment during poor weather and working as part of the 
two-person mobile units that check on street populations in Santa Monica, 
Beverly Hills, Culver City, Westwood and parts of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, hiring was frozen at the clinic, and last week, the clinic laid off 
six of its 12 staff members. Panitch was considering starting a private 
practice and was looking for an office. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria and Allan Panitch said their daughter, a union activist who decried the 
layoffs, often volunteered to work overtime for free at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'She Knew' 
</P>
<P>
"She'd volunteer her time because the county would not give her enough time," 
her father said. 
</P>
<P>
More time meant more exposure to danger, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew," her mother added. "She told me that she was alone in this office 
where anybody could walk in."

EPA CITES 23 MUFFLER SHOPS IN CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that 109 muffler shops 
throughout the country are violating federal law by installing improper 
after-market catalytic converters on cars. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that violation notices totaling more than $1 million in 
proposed fines have been sent to the shops, including 23 in California, two of 
which are in Orange County. Of the 23 California shops, 15 were identified as 
Midas Muffler outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the violations involved the installation of what the EPA said were 
"cheaper, less effective" two-way catalytic converters on vehicles requiring 
three-way converters. Three-way converters control emissions of nitrogen oxide 
in addition to hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. 
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide is a major ingredient in photochemical smog. It combines in 
sunlight with hydrocarbons to form ozone. 
</P>
<P>
However, Richard G. Kozlowski of the EPA's enforcement office said the 109 
shops represent only a small percentage of the estimated 250,000 muffler 
outlets nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Kozlowski said three-way converters are clearly more expensive than two-way 
converters. Retail prices on a three-way converter could run from $20 to $50 
more. But, Kozlowski said, shops will sell a cheaper two-way converter either 
to draw in customers in a very competitive business or to "maximize their 
profits." In other cases, he said, incorrect installations could result from 
honest mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of several muffler shops that were cited, as well as a senior executive 
of Midas International in Chicago, denied that there was a profit incentive for 
a shop to install a two-way instead of a three-way converter because the price 
difference is small. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that is the case. All the franchisees I spoke to said it was a 
misapplication. It was not a matter of cost," Russell Richards, senior vice 
president of franchises at Midas International, said in a telephone interview 
from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon F. Bowley, attorney for the California Midas Dealers Assn., said: "It's 
not a fair characterization that it was something installed because it was 
cheaper to install. It was an error from the manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
One Midas dealer, Charles Margolin, whose shop on Centre Drive in El Toro was 
cited for five improper installations, said he already has replaced the 
converters on three of those cars at no charge and is attempting to contact the 
owners of the other two cars. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin, whose shop was honored by the Midas chain in 1987 for being the 
highest-volume franchise with no customer complaints, said the errors were 
inadvertent. 
</P>
<P>
"We comply strictly with the law, and we are trying to correct the mistakes," 
Margolin said Tuesday. "There were some errors made because the converters have 
the same shape but different numbers. The mechanics inadvertently installed the 
wrong ones." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Beattie, a Midas dealer in Palmdale, said, "I don't think any of the 
shops that did it did it intentionally." 
</P>
<P>
They added that all affected customers are being notified and that the correct 
converters are being installed at no further cost. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for one of the converter manufacturers, Car Sound Exhaust System of 
La Mirada, said that there have been no errors in either the instructions or 
part numbers for several years and that mistaken installations were probably 
the fault of the shop employees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that much money involved. It sounds like they're moving so fast 
they're not paying much attention to what they put in," said Car Sound attorney 
Stephen Gigliotti. 
</P>
<P>
Gigliotti said the wholesale price for a two-way converter is $49.95. The 
wholesale price of a three-way is $54.95. The retail markup is usually about 
300%, he said.

<P>
Most of the men and women who walk into county mental health outpatient clinics 
are a danger only to themselves, casualties of private wars that rage only 
within their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then, however, a patient will present a more tangible danger to 
the professionals who staff these psychiatric outposts. And, as word of the 
stabbing death of clinical social worker Robbyn Panitch spread among her 
colleagues Tuesday afternoon, many recalled their own close calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times you don't know who is sitting in front of you," said Dr. Randall 
Firling, a psychiatrist with the County Homeless Outreach Program. "It can be 
someone who is very paranoid, either delusional or hallucinatory. To (her 
assailant), Robbyn may have been his mother, a girlfriend who booted him out, 
God, or who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Even as investigators were trying to determine just why an outpatient, 
identified by Santa Monica police as David Smith, brutally attacked Panitch on 
Tuesday, mental health professionals said they fear that there could be more 
such attacks after dramatic budgetary cutbacks in the county mental health 
system take effect on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I hear something like this, it confirms my worst nightmare," said Julie 
Ann Hargaray, a psychiatric technician at El Camino Mental Health Center in 
Santa Fe Springs. "I've been kicked in the head, spat at, punched in the 
stomach. I'm concerned about what's going to happen with the clinic cuts." 
</P>
<P>
County officials, however, said there was no reason to believe that the attack 
was related in any way to the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tragic incident and it's important to note that people who have not 
had mental illnesses have committed such violence," said Mental Health Director 
Roberto Quiroz. He said he saw no reason to believe that clinics will be less 
safe for workers or the public after the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the most severely and chronically mentally ill will 
continue to get treatment and medication, and that many other patients will 
seek care at private clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Van Horn, executive director of the Mental Health Assn., which 
represents patients, their families and workers, agreed that the assault 
Tuesday was an isolated case. But he expressed fear that some mentally ill 
people who are being deprived of care might respond violently. 
</P>
<P>
Such patients "are getting frustrated and angry, and things are escalating," 
Van Horn said. "The real tragedy is that the state is not recognizing the level 
of the problem that we've got." 
</P>
<P>
Because a lack of state funds for mental health programs, Los Angeles County 
ordered $18 million in budget cuts, which will force the closure of eight 
mental health outpatient clinics, affecting about 20,000 patients from the San 
Fernando Valley to the South Bay. Services will be drastically reduced at 
another five clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the cutbacks, mental health workers said, patients with borderline 
psychoses will be forced out of the outpatient system to make room for the most 
seriously ill. Consequently, more mentally ill people will either have no care 
at all or be forced to be hospitalized during their worst episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely likely that an identifiable percentage of these patients will 
become violent," predicted Melinda Bird, a staff attorney with the Western 
Center on Law and Poverty that represents indigent, mentally ill patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Will Direct That Violence' 
</P>
<P>
"And they will direct that violence against those who are close to them. That 
will definitely include county mental health staff, and family members and 
people they bump into in the community as well." 
</P>
<P>
A dozen mental health care workers interviewed Tuesday said that most routinely 
have been exposed to dangers. But now, they stressed, they will have to deal 
with a greater percentage of seriously ill patients with fewer workers. 
Officials say between 240 and 280 mental health workers are to be laid off 
under the cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients do not deal with stress and change very well," said Paul 
Schettler, director of the San Pedro Mental Health Center. "Our concern is 
we'll see more and more crises similar to this. . . . This is the only 
fatality, but we've had many other situations come close." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the patients come through the front door of the county mental health 
clinics quietly depressed or disoriented. But others draw knives tucked under 
pant legs, hurl ashtrays at receptionists and threaten to kill the very people 
who are trying to help them. In one case a few years ago, a distraught patient 
followed a worker into a clinic coffee area and tried to strangle her. 
</P>
<P>
County officials in charge of security for clinics were busy investigating the 
assault Tuesday and could not be reached for statistics on previous attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Security provisions vary from clinic to clinic, workers said. At some, workers 
have silent alarms under their desks. Because of the patients' need for 
privacy, most interviews are done in private offices. In some clinics there is 
a security guard. But in most clinics, including the site of the slaying, 
staffers must call police if they need help, workers said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the drop-in clinics must remain open to serve clients who need help, 
the ranks of mental health workers on duty after hours is likely to drop, 
reducing the protection that workers feel from other staffers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, workers said, the county offered workers optional self-defense 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be turning down sex offenders, we're going to be turning down 
wife-beaters, we're going to be turning down all sorts of people who need 
help," said one veteran psychiatric worker who asked that his name not be used. 
"How would you like to be a woman working late at night with only a 
receptionist between you and the front door?"

A 21-year-old Riverside man has been arrested on suspicion of homicide in the 
death of Lee Matthew Clyde, 20, whose body was found in an El Toro motel room 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Romano Benjamin was arrested at an El Toro apartment complex Monday 
night after information developed by investigators "pointed to this person," 
said Lt. Robert Rivas of the county Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said he had no information on a motive in the killing or the relationship 
between Benjamin and the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde, who suffered a trauma to the head, was found at 9 a.m. Monday in a room 
in the Quality Suites Inn in the 2300 block of Lake Center Drive. Coroner's 
officials refused to provide the findings of an autopsy conducted Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said he did not know if or when Clyde, who lived in El Toro, or Benjamin 
had rented the motel room. No further information was available Tuesday.

TOPPLING OF A FORKLIFT TIES UP ORANGE FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic was snarled for about an hour on the southbound Orange Freeway on 
Tuesday afternoon after a truck towing an 18-foot-tall forklift struck a 
17-foot overpass. 
</P>
<P>
The force of the crash threw the driver of the truck, Roland Ostiguy, 44, of 
Yorba Linda, and his passenger forward, but the men were not injured because 
they were wearing seat belts, said Officer Mike Lundquist of the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Ostiguy was driving about 55 m.p.h. The boom of the forklift extended about 18 
feet into the air, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck passed under the Yorba Linda Boulevard overpass, but the boom struck 
it, causing the forklift to overturn onto the freeway, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Fire Department was called to clean up spilled gasoline. 
Caltrans officials checked the overpass for potential structural damage, 
Lundquist said.

3 'SKINHEADS' BLAMED FOR SCHOOL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three "skinheads" stabbed and robbed a student at Loara High School shortly 
after classes let out for the day Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified only as a 17-year-old male, was in stable condition at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange with two wounds to the leg and abdomen, according 
to Anaheim Police Sgt. Jim George. 
</P>
<P>
School officials summoned police about 3:30 p.m., but George could not say 
whether the attack occurred in the school or on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
George said the student was stabbed with a "butterfly" knife, a knife that 
flips open with a flick of the wrist. Police could not say how much money was 
stolen from the youth. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers were identified as three boys ages 16 to 17 with shaved heads, 
leading police to identify them as skinheads, or members of a group of youths 
with shaved heads who espouse white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers were described as white males, each between 5 foot 3 inches and 5 
foot 7 inches tall, and each weighing 120 to 150 pounds, George said.

ANAHEIM OKS SPECIAL TAXES FOR TWO AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONN JOHNSTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of future Anaheim homeowners were slapped with special taxes Tuesday 
night to pay for more than $21 million in road improvements, a park and a new 
police station to be built in the eastern part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
On a 4-0 vote, with one abstention, the City Council created two special tax 
areas called Mello-Roos districts, the first of their kind in Anaheim. The 
lawmakers postponed a vote, however, on a final list of road projects to be 
built in a third such proposed district. That district, for a development 
called the Summit, is expected to be created by a City Council vote in late 
March. 
</P>
<P>
No one yet lives in the three planned communities -- Sycamore Canyon, the 
Highlands and the Summit -- but lot grading for the 5,500 new homes and 
condominiums has already begun. The special tax will be imposed as a 
supplemental property tax on homeowners in the upscale communities after they 
move in. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the owner of a $300,000 home in the Sycamore Canyon Mello-Roos 
District will pay an extra $1,277 in annual property taxes, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The special taxes were requested by the communities' developers. Previously the 
developers -- Woodcrest Development, Presley of Southern California and the 
Baldwin Building Co. -- had agreed to city conditions that they would build 
certain roads and provide other area improvements as a condition for housing 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood, who abstained in the vote Tuesday, said last week: 
"This is very disturbing to me. We had development agreements reached last year 
on the three ranches and they had well over 100 conditions. They had agreed to 
a number of things very willingly, perhaps because Measure A (the countywide 
slow-growth initiative) was pending. Then they got all excited about 
Mello-Roos." 
</P>
<P>
Mello-Roos districts were made possible by a state law passed in 1982. Anaheim 
is only the second city in north Orange County to establish one, the first 
having been created by Yorba Linda in 1987 as a back-up financing tool for a 
road bridge. But such special tax districts have become increasingly common in 
the undeveloped south county area. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors has used Mello-Roos districts to pay for new 
roads, libraries, fire stations and other public construction. Mello-Roos was 
the central financing device for the Foothill Circulation Phasing Plan that 
will generate $240 million from developers for a network of new roads east of 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The bill to allow the creation of such districts was jointly sponsored by Sen. 
Henry Mello (D-Watsonville) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). Its 
passage created a novel way for special taxing districts to be formed to get 
around Proposition 13, the 1978 measure that slashed local governments' ability 
to raise money through property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 13 rolled back property tax rates and required a two-thirds vote of 
a community before any new tax could be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Under Mello-Roos, only the concurrence of the developer or property owner is 
necessary to impose the additional tax after a local government creates a 
Community Facilities District on undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
Money from Anaheim's Mello-Roos Community Facilities districts will pay for a 
new police substation in the eastern Anaheim Hills area, provide a new park in 
Deer Canyon and a storm drain, extend Serrano Avenue to Weir Canyon Road, widen 
Santa Ana Canyon Road and subsidize part of the ongoing costs of area police 
and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Will Sell Bonds 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved Tuesday night, the city will now sell bonds to pay for 
the improvements. The bonds will then be repaid over a 25-year period by 
homeowners in the Mello-Roos districts, said Gregory Trombley, administrative 
services coordinator for the city's public works and engineering department. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its agreement with the developers, the city required that first-time 
home buyers in the districts be warned of the additional property taxes they 
will be paying, Trombley said. 
</P>
<P>
Each development will have a different tax rate, all above the prevailing 
annual property tax rate of 1.05% for nearby communities already built, 
according to a city report. In Sycamore Canyon it will be 1.48%, for the 
Highlands 1.46%. And if the Mello-Roos district is approved for the Summit, the 
rate there will be 1.34%. 
</P>
<P>
According to city building permits, more than 50 of Sycamore Canyon's final 
1,100 homes should be constructed by this summer. More than 100 of the 
Highlands' 2,000 homes should be built by that time. The Summit development, 
with more than 2,000 homes planned, probably won't have any structures until 
the summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated prices for the most expensive homes in the developments range from a 
low of $328,000 in Sycamore Canyon to a high of $434,500 for the Summit, 
according to city figures.

CONDOMINIUMS MOVE CLOSER FOR LANDFILL IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ascon Properties moved one step closer Tuesday night to building hundreds of 
condominiums on its contaminated former landfill behind Edison High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach City Council voted 4 to 3 in favor of a General Plan 
amendment changing the property's designated land use from public, quasi-public 
and institutional to residential, with the possibility of up to 600 
condominiums. The actual number of condominiums will be decided later. 
</P>
<P>
While the approval is necessary for the developer to proceed with the project, 
it still is conditioned on numerous incomplete environmental studies now under 
way as to precisely how the landfill -- declared a hazardous waste site by the 
state -- can be cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 people attended the council meeting, most of them favoring no 
development on the property or, at most, single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
T.K. Brimer told the council that he had made some good land buys and some bad 
buys, but unlike Ascon, "I never had the nerve to come to the city to bail me 
out of one of my bad buys." 
</P>
<P>
But David Johnson argued that the council should do whatever it can to get the 
hazardous site cleaned up and urged approval of the condominium project. He 
said it would be "removing an eyesore and a hazardous area." 
</P>
<P>
Most everyone living around the parcel and its two hazardous waste pits have 
complained of noxious odors in past years, and Ascon subsequently covered one 
of the pits. And some residents said that they would opt for the dump over a 
development that, inevitably, will increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Ascon Vice President John Lindsey said consultants have estimated that it will 
cost the firm between $10 million and $15 million to remove the hazardous 
substances from the now empty, 39 1/2-acre parcel, which was used as a 
waste-disposal site for oil field operations from 1938 to 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the hazardous materials are low-grade petroleum products that can be 
treated on the site, according to a study conducted for Ascon by Radion Corp. 
However, some of the more highly toxic substances, such as styrene tar, will 
have to be hauled from the property to an Arkansas disposal site -- a more 
costly task. 
</P>
<P>
Ascon officials contend that they must build a project with more density than 
single-family homes in order to recoup the firm's substantial financial 
investment to clean up the site. Preliminary studies by the city's consultant, 
Kaiser-Marsten, suggest that a less dense development might generate income 
"adequate" to cover cleanup costs, plus a profit.

THE COLOR OF MONEY WAS JUST A BIT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Tachick brakes for bucks. Even counterfeit ones, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
Tachick, 42, was driving home about 10:30 Monday night with his friend, Brent 
Smith, when the car in front of them on Alton Parkway rolled over a garbage bag 
in the road, sending the bag's contents of $100 bills fluttering into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to Brent, I think that's money," Tachick said. "He said, 'No way.' But 
we stopped and he started yelling, 'It's cash!' " 
</P>
<P>
The euphoria was momentary. Tachick, vice president of franchise sales for a 
printing chain, recognized the bills as counterfeit. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a professional attempt -- it was pretty amateur," Tachick said. "The 
color was off and the paper wasn't right. Some of the bills were misprinted 
too, with a front or a back that didn't turn out." 
</P>
<P>
More than $100,000 was found in the bag and along Alton Parkway from Sand 
Canyon Avenue to the Costa Mesa Freeway in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller quantities were found at several other locations in Irvine and in 
southeast Santa Ana and Tustin, according to Irvine Police Officer Gary Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
"It was dark and the road wasn't very traveled, or we would have had a pretty 
interesting situation," Harvey said. "It must have been dumped just before they 
came along, because it scattered pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service, which investigates counterfeiting, is looking for the 
printer, said Harvey, who added that the quality of the bills was so poor that 
"it would have to be pretty dark to pass one of these." 
</P>
<P>
Tachick and Smith, who called Irvine police, helped officers gather the bills. 
As they were picking up the money, a young woman stopped her car, stepped out 
and handed them $900 of the bills that she had apparently picked up without 
realizing that the money was fake. 
</P>
<P>
"There were wet footprints all over the place around the bills," Irvine Police 
Sgt. Gary Shull said. "It looked like a lot of people went home with some 
counterfeit cash." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 32, a Utah native who is living with Tachick's family, said he is not 
sure what he would have done if it had turned out to be real currency on the 
roadside. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that I would do the right thing, but jeez, a bag of $100 bills in 
the middle of nowhere," Smith said. "Nobody would know. It would be tempting."

SAN JUAN MOVES TOWARD FARMLAND PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano City Council on Tuesday night took a first step toward 
buying 200 acres of farmland to prevent its development. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to a proposal by Mayor Gary Hausdorfer that the city hire 
consultants to study the idea of selling a municipal bond to raise money for 
the land. That bond, if approved by voters, would act as a savings account, 
giving the city funds to buy land from farmers in the open market. It also 
could be written to guarantee that the land would only be used for open space, 
a park area or possibly a school site. 
</P>
<P>
The bond would be repaid by an additional tax of between $200 and $500 per year 
on all property owners in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the city zoned 230 acres as farmland, a designation which depreciates 
its sale value, farmers have argued. Although buyers potentially could develop 
that land with city approval, the label itself tends to reduce the price that 
the land will command, farmers said. 
</P>
<P>
The bond would allow local farmers to sell their land to the city, which in 
turn would get more recreation space. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to preserve agriculture as a city, we need to come up with a system 
to let the farmers be treated fairly," Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants will develop financing options for the property, write a bond 
and appraise the sites, which include 56 acres of Kinoshita Farms off Alipaz 
Street and Charles Vermuelen Farms along Camino del Avion and along north 
Camino Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action was the first step toward putting the bond issue on a 
November, 1989, or April, 1990, ballot, Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question people are going to be faced with is whether they want the 
land to remain as open space or do they want it to be developed," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime farmer Robert Kinoshita of Kinoshita Farms said the 1977 farmland 
zoning has prevented him and his brother Shig from selling their land and 
retiring. The Kinoshitas have owned their farm since 1955 but are eager to sell 
it and move. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's money is as good as anybody else's," he said. "As long as we can 
get a fair market price." 
</P>
<P>
Some farm owners, however, have managed to make some deals despite the 1977 
zoning. 
</P>
<P>
William Bathgate's 77-acre ranch is in escrow with the Rev. Robert H. Schuller 
Ministries as a possible cemetery site. Alex J. Michaels has considered plans 
to sell his 23 acres of land to the owner of a San Clemente car dealership.

'NERDS' GET REVENGE AT UCI WITH A WEEK OF ZANY GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During most of the school year, UC Irvine's engineering students tend to fade 
into the wallpaper of the library. 
</P>
<P>
"They have so much to study, they can't be playing like some other students," 
explained Fred Sawyer, a former assistant dean of the School of Engineering. 
"Some call our engineering students 'nerds.' " 
</P>
<P>
But once a year at UCI, it is time for Revenge of the Nerds -- better known as 
Engineering Week. Like a rite of passage, the student engineers laugh at 
themselves with a series of zany games and events. "Engineering Week lets the 
students show they aren't all nerds and that they do have a sense of humor," 
Sawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine campus launched its 1989 version Tuesday. And as in past years, the 
usually staid decor of UCI's Engineering Plaza was transformed into something 
of a TV game-show set. 
</P>
<P>
Students threw paper airplanes from the upper levels of the Engineering 
Building, cheering on their entries. 
</P>
<P>
On the ground below, an engineering faculty member led another game, this one 
somewhat akin to "Simon Says." The student contestants, however, had to figure 
out rapid multiplications, subtractions and square roots -- while also jumping 
around and raising their hands and legs. 
</P>
<P>
In an upstairs classroom, students divided into teams for a contest resembling 
the TV game show "Win, Lose or Draw." Contestants raced to blackboards to draw 
clues to words and phrases. The competition produced groans, moans and cheers 
as student spectators watched combatting teams. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Harper, 37, an electrical engineering senior from Dana Point, looked 
anxious when she was told that her hidden phrase would be a term from 
astrophysics. But she grinned when she saw the phrase: black hole. She raced to 
the blackboard, drew a cavernous opening, and within seconds teammates yelled, 
"Black hole!" 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rigaud, 21, an electrical engineering student from Fountain Valley, 
paused only a second when he got his word: ion. Rigaud then quickly drew a 
nuclear ring, with a particle spewing out. "Ion! Ion!" shouted his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Rigaud and a teammate talked about why they enjoy Engineering 
Week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance to show we're not all stereotypes," Rigaud said. "One of the 
things people say about us is that engineering students are 'excessively 
diligent.' Now that is just not accurate. I certainly don't start all my 
homework on time." 
</P>
<P>
Lance Rushing, 20, an electrical engineering sophomore from Anaheim, said, "We 
spend long hours watching TV shows, like 'Star Trek.' " He added, with a grin: 
"So we can't be too far out of it, because we watch relevant TV shows." 
</P>
<P>
William A. Sirignano, dean of the School of Engineering, said that one of the 
things the annual celebration does is help lighten the image of student 
engineers. "My perception is that it helps make it look like it's more fun," 
Sirignano said. "And the contests during Engineering Week are fun." 
</P>
<P>
Not far from Sirignano's office, clusters of engineering students were taking 
part in a bridge-building contest. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty members gave stress and weight tests to the model bridges constructed 
of Popsicle sticks. The student builders, meanwhile, stood watching nervously. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy with our bridge," said Denis Bilodeau, 20, a junior from 
Southgate. He said that he and his teammate, Mark Schroeder, 20, a junior from 
Sacramento, had spent about 3 weeks building the model. The small bridge 
survived a test of more than 400 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
As Bilodeau watched, two non-engineering students walked across the Engineering 
Plaza and peered at the activity. One glanced at the model bridges, smiled and 
said: "Well, look at that. It must be Engineering Week again!" 
</P>

A COP'S BEST FRIEND

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Officer Judy Stanbra hasn't talked to her partner in 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Yet they went to school together. They walk the beat together. They even live 
together. 
</P>
<P>
But even though they aren't great conversationalists, Stanbra says, she and her 
partner get along quite well. 
</P>
<P>
Stanbra's partner is a dog -- Sammy, a 4-year-old Belgian malinois. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my partner during the day, but he becomes a pet at home," said Stanbra, 
an animal lover who, besides Sammy, lives with two civilian dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Stanbra, 31, is a 7 1/2-year police veteran. She has long had an interest in 
veterinary medicine and said she applied for the canine unit because she enjoys 
"being outside and working with animals." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons we picked her is because she had a special feeling working 
with animals," said Sgt. Raul Luna, head of Santa Ana Police Department's 
six-member canine unit. "She was excellent in training." 
</P>
<P>
Five of the department's dogs are Belgian malinois imported from the 
Netherlands, where they are trained by Dutch police before being sent to Santa 
Ana. (The sixth canine is a German shepherd.) 
</P>
<P>
The police officer and the dog then train together for 5 weeks before they 
begin patrolling the streets. Besides working together, they live together. 
</P>
<P>
The canine unit, which was started in February, 1982, is used primarily to 
assist in looking for suspects in buildings or other areas and in SWAT 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
"They're able to use their noses and give us a better chance of finding 
suspects," Stanbra said. 
</P>
<P>
"Dogs can also do the . . . (search) faster," Luna said.

KRAFT DEFENSE BLAMES ONE MURDER ON CHILD MOLESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense in the trial of Randy Steven Kraft continued its efforts Tuesday to 
shift some of the blame to a convicted child molester who committed suicide 
shortly after Kraft's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the judge has kept out most of the evidence involving the child 
molester, based on arguments from the prosecution that there is little, if any, 
evidence to connect him with the victims. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Donald A. McCartin said he would 
reluctantly allow testimony about the child molester. The defense wants to link 
the molester with several of the murders of Marines that Kraft is charged with. 
</P>
<P>
"In the abundance of caution," McCartin said he would allow the defense to 
introduce evidence he considered "pretty far afield." The judge also expressed 
concern about the slow pace of the case being put on by the defense for the 
last 4 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comment on Slowness 
</P>
<P>
"With the progress we're making here, the jury is going to get disenchanted, I 
don't know with whom," McCartin said. The judge added that he worried whether 
the slowness would cause jurors to have a problem grasping all the evidence 
before them. 
</P>
<P>
Kraft, 43, is on trial in Santa Ana charged with 16 murders in Orange County. 
If he is convicted, prosecutors might introduce evidence at a penalty phase 
that Kraft committed as many as 45 murders in Southern California, Oregon and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the 16 young men Kraft is charged with killing were Marines. Prosecutors 
have told the jury they believe that all 16 victims were either hitchhikers or 
were offered a ride by Kraft. Most of the victims' bodies showed signs of 
sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The defense is blaming the death of one of those Marines, Donnie Lee Crisel, on 
John McMillan, the convicted child molester who killed himself in 1983 -- just 
5 days after Kraft's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lived Near Base 
</P>
<P>
McMillan lived near the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station and at one 
time was a potential suspect in the June 16, 1979, death of Crisel, who was 
stationed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station but had visited friends at 
the Tustin base the night he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has kept out most of the evidence involving McMillan, based on 
arguments from Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown that none of it should be 
admissible. Brown argued that there was no connection between McMillan and the 
Crisel death other than that McMillan had once been placed under surveillance 
during the investigation of the murders, and a Marine reported that McMillan 
once took him home and wanted to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's relevant," Brown told the judge at a hearing outside the 
jury's presence. "What you have here is conduct of a homosexual out trying to 
get consensual sex . . . you don't have anything." 
</P>
<P>
But defense attorney D. Thomas McDonald countered: "I think the relevancy is 
overwhelming. . . . Reasonable doubt should be afforded to us in whatever form 
we can present it to this jury to consider." McDonald told the court that the 
defense may try to link McMillan to several other of the Marine deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also lambasted McDonald for what he considered insinuations by the 
defense that investigators for the district attorney were discouraging some 
witnesses from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Bent Over Backwards' 
</P>
<P>
"Judge, we have bent over backwards to help these guys (the defense) and the 
court continually allows them to go at this snail's pace; it's ridiculous," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense was granted a delay of nearly two months after Brown closed his 
case when McDonald told the court that he and co-counsel James G. Merwin were 
having trouble scheduling witnesses. Since Kraft attorneys began their case on 
Jan. 30, they have had trouble lining up enough witnesses to keep the trial 
going for full court days. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald explained that the problem was primarily in lining up witnesses. But 
also, he argued, he cannot always anticipate when the judge's rulings against 
him will interrupt his witness plans. 
</P>
<P>
In other evidence Tuesday, a tire design expert who worked for the Firestone 
Co. for 28 years testified that a tire print on Crisel's shorts, where the 
victim had been run over, did not come from Kraft's car. However, law 
enforcement officials are not contending that it was Kraft's car that left the 
mark. Crisel's body was partially on the Irvine Center Drive on-ramp to the San 
Diego Freeway when found.

A federal judge Tuesday ordered attorneys for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service and advocates for farm-worker amnesty applicants to work 
out a compromise on a lawsuit filed against Border Patrol agents who have 
illegally seized documents from dozens of migrant workers. U.S. District Judge 
J. Lawrence Irving ordered INS attorney Charles Hamilton and Stephen Rosenbaum, 
a lawyer with the California Rural Legal Assistance, to reach a compromise by 
April 24. CRLA lawyers teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union to sue 
the INS in December to stop the border agents from seizing the documents.

SANTA ANA'S OPPORTUNITY TURNS INTO A 1-0 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
El Toro High School's defensive lapse and Santa Ana's stamina were the keys in 
the Saints' 1-0 victory Tuesday in a second-round Southern Section 3-A boys' 
soccer match at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The only goal came about 9 minutes into the second half after the ball bounced 
off an El Toro defender about 20 yards in front of the El Toro goal. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't quite clear it and Marco (Silva) was able to get to it and put 
it in," Santa Ana Coach Ernie Salgado said. 
</P>
<P>
Silva, a halfback, got the ball and nailed a left-footed drive past goalie 
Kevin Rowe for his 10th goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a poor clearance," El Toro Coach Carlos Arce said. "You just can't make 
a mistake against the good teams. If you do, you're pulling the ball out of the 
back of the net." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Arce was pleased that the Chargers (12-7-3) were competitive 
with the third-seeded Saints (19-1-6). 
</P>
<P>
"Our team fought to the end, that means a lot, that's big time, " Arce said. 
"The last 10 minutes of the game they were there. The adrenaline was there." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana weathered a furious assault by El Toro in the waning minutes. The 
Chargers, who had only three shots on goals to Santa Ana's 11 in the first 
half, managed 11 second-half shots, six in the last 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some close calls in there," Salgado said. "In the playoffs when you 
get down to the last 10 minutes just about any team will start pushing people 
up because it's do or die." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' superior conditioning helped them survive the barrage, Salgado 
said. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro left wing Doug Barry continually threatened to score. One of his best 
shots on goal came in the first half. His header off a penalty kick 20 yards 
out bounced off the top of the Saints' goal. He had two more headers late in 
the game. One went wide right, and the other was picked off. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana was slightly out of sync defensively in the first half because of the 
absence of starting stopper Jose Navarrete, who did not attend the game because 
of "personal problems," Salgado said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana had several scoring opportunities in the first half but El Toro 
goalie Kevin Rowe, who had 10 saves, played solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed with their goalie," Salgado said. "He was fast and he was 
good. There was one play where Gus (Placensia) just fired it into the goal 
one-on-one and he stopped it." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana goalie Hector Ramos had seven saves as the Saints collected their 
13th shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints will play Riverside Poly, a 6-1 winner over Gahr, in the 
quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Salgado was pleased with his team's performance but said it would take a better 
effort to win the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're really to win (Southern Section), we have to start from the very 
beginning and control the whole game, not just part of the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In another 3-A match: 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 4, St. John Bosco 0 -- Midfielder Joe Max-Moore scored three 
goals to lead visiting Mission Viejo (22-1-3), the top-seeded team in the 4-A 
Division. Max-Moore leads Mission Viejo with 22 goals this season. Doug 
Roverson scored the other goal for Mission Viejo, the South Coast League 
champions.

Mater Dei High School's girls' soccer team plays host to Long Beach Wilson 
today in a Southern Section 3-A second-round match at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, the second-ranked team in the 3-A, is 20-4-2 overall, and defeated 
Trabuco Hills, 4-0, in last Friday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
A victory for Mater Dei today would be a landmark as the Monarchs have never 
advanced past the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs, which finished second to Mission Viejo at the Ocean View 
tournament final this season and last, are led by goalkeeper Michelle Lodyga, 
sweeper Saule Sadunas and midfielder Tina Manfre. 
</P>
<P>
In other 3-A second-round matches today, No. 6 Canyon (16-2-3) plays host to La 
Quinta (13-1-4); No. 7 Orange (11-1-2) travels to Santa Barbara (15-6-2); No. 9 
Troy (11-2-2) plays host to No. 3 Moreno Valley (15-2-1); El Modena (8-7-2) 
travels to No. 4 Bishop Amat (12-4-2) and Kennedy (11-9-1) plays host to San 
Gorgonio (16-4-4). 
</P>
<P>
In another featured 3-A match, top-seeded and undefeated Agoura (19-0) will 
play host to defending champion Buena (13-8-2). Last season, Buena defeated 
Esperanza in the 3-A championship match. BARBIE LUDOVISE

Jeff Bickmore led Southern California College to a 79-67 victory over Fresno 
Pacific in a Golden State Athletic Conference basketball game Tuesday at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
SCC trailed at halftime, 32-27, but Bickmore scored 14 points during an 18-0 
SCC run in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty much standing around defensively, playing pretty flat-footed 
and passively," SCC Coach Bill Reynolds said. "And you could say we alluded to 
that rather strongly at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
Bickmore scored on a layup, then Terry Scruggs stole the ball and took it 
fullcourt for a layup. In the next 5 minutes SCC (25-3 overall, 12-3 in 
conference) used a full-court press to force eight bad Fresno shots. 
</P>
<P>
"The second half I was just getting the ball and getting good position inside," 
Bickmore said. "(The run) was caused mainly by our defense getting loose balls 
and making steals." 
</P>
<P>
Said Reynolds: "We usually get a spurt like that, thank goodness. And we never 
know if or when it will come." 
</P>
<P>
SCC shot 50% during the second half and 41% for the game, but a 13-point lead 
became six points, 67-61, with 4 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our peak and then went right back into the valley, " Reynolds said. "I 
guess that's really what you call game slippage." 
</P>
<P>
SCC and Fresno traded baskets the first 5 minutes of play and after tying the 
score, 14-14, and three scoreless minutes, Fresno (17-12, 8-5) pulled ahead to 
take the halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Bickmore led all scorers with 25 points, Scruggs added 22 and Todd Dixon had 
21. For Fresno, Donnie Johnson had 18, and Brian Falls had 11. 
</P>
<P>
In another Golden State Athletic Conference men's game: 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran 130, Christ College Irvine 96 -- Steve deLaveaga scored a 
single-game school record 51 points for host Cal Lutheran. He was 20 of 30 from 
field and 7 of 12 from three-point range. It was the 81st consecutive game he 
has scored in double figures. He is averaging a conference high 28.1 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Clasen scored 22 points and Albert Gay added 20 points and a team-high 10 
rebounds for Christ College (4-25, 0-13). 
</P>
<P>
In a Golden State Athletic Conference women's game: 
</P>
<P>
Fresno Pacific 66, Southern California 50 -- Irene Robles and Kellie Fry scored 
17 points each to lead visiting Fresno Pacific (21-7, 11-2). Roxanne Trost 
scored 12 and Paula Hale 11 for SCC (5-24, 1-11).

DREXEL 'JUNK BOND' UNIT REPORTEDLY TO STAY IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission will permit Drexel Burnham Lambert's 
highly profitable "junk bond" department to remain in Beverly Hills under terms 
of a settlement likely to be made public soon, sources close to the 
negotiations said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In talks on settling pending SEC charges of fraud, insider trading and stock 
market manipulation, the agency had demanded that Drexel move the high-yield 
junk bond operation back to the firm's headquarters in New York, where SEC 
officials felt it could be more closely supervised. 
</P>
<P>
But Drexel strongly resisted, claiming that closure of the office would be 
catastrophic to the firm's business. Officials said they feared an exodus of 
key employees who were reluctant to move. The junk bond department, headed by 
Michael Milken, has been the direct or indirect source of most of Drexel's 
profits. Its activities also have been the source of nearly all of the firm's 
legal problems with federal regulators and the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of being forced to close the Beverly Hills office prompted Drexel in 
January to mount a lobbying campaign with Los Angeles city officials and 
congressmen from California. Both of California's senators and seven 
representatives wrote to SEC Chairman David S. Ruder asking that Drexel be 
permitted to keep the office open. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement, however, were worked out with the SEC's enforcement 
staff. Ruder and the other commissioners are believed not to have officially 
considered it yet, and it isn't known if they played any role in shaping it. 
The commissioners must formally approve the settlement before it becomes 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills office was founded by Milken in 1978. He had almost 
single-handedly developed Drexel's hugely profitable junk bond business in New 
York and then won approval to move the department to his native Los Angeles. 
The junk bond operation has been a major force in financing hostile corporate 
raids and leveraged buyouts. Although the department nominally was under 
control from New York, Milken in actuality was allowed much independence. 
</P>
<P>
The accord would end the SEC's lawsuit, which has been pending against Drexel 
since September. It also would clear the way for Drexel to carry out its 
announced agreement with federal prosecutors in New York to plead guilty to six 
criminal counts and pay $650 million in penalties. Under that agreement, Drexel 
is also supposed to fire Milken and deprive him of his 1988 bonus. But that 
provision is being challenged in court by Milken's lawyers. Milken, who denies 
any wrongdoing, is still expected to be indicted on a variety of securities 
fraud and racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the core of the junk bond operation will remain in Beverly Hills, the 
agreement will, as expected, require Drexel to move some peripheral operations 
back to New York, sources said. These include trading in convertible securities 
and the limited trading in stocks carried out by the high-yield department. 
</P>
<P>
Although the junk bond operation will remain where it is, the Beverly Hills 
office will be subject to much closer scrutiny under provisions of the 
tentative settlement, the sources said. The firm will be required to name at 
least two outside directors to its 22-member board, and it will pay for the 
services of a Philadelphia-based law firm, Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, 
selected by the SEC, to closely review Drexel's compliance with securities 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
It is understood that one reason the firm was selected is that it has offices 
in Los Angeles as well as in New York. A member of the law firm's management 
committee noted that the SEC commissioners hadn't taken final action on the 
settlement yet and so declined to comment on reports that his firm had been 
selected to monitor Drexel's compliance. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgan Lewis firm has been retained before to conduct this type of 
monitoring for the SEC. It was hired in 1987 to review procedures at Los 
Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co., a brokerage firm, after its founder and 
chief executive, Boyd L. Jefferies, pleaded guilty to securities fraud charges. 
The law firm found no major problems at Jefferies. But some congressmen and 
others at the time criticized the selection of Morgan Lewis because the firm 
had been Jefferies &amp; Co.'s outside counsel while Boyd Jefferies carried out 
his illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan Lewis, however, doesn't represent Drexel. And a source said the SEC is 
likely to require a much more extensive review of Drexel than it required of 
Jefferies &amp; Co.

U.S. EXPECTS TO PAY $30 BILLION TO CLOSE S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH SEEKS $44 BILLION MORE FOR MERGERS; SKEPTICS CALL PLAN TOO OPTIMISTIC 
</P>

<P>
The Bush Administration, unveiling financial details of its savings and loan 
rescue plan, said Tuesday that it expects to spend $30 billion to shut crippled 
S&amp;Ls and pay off depositors over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for additional outlays of $44 billion on "assisted" 
mergers, with the government offering substantial financial incentives and 
guarantees to persuade outside investors to buy ailing institutions. 
</P>
<P>
However, both figures may be too low, because they don't include enough funds 
to dispose of S&amp;Ls that are now solvent but ultimately will become too weak 
to survive, experts warned. 
</P>
<P>
"These numbers are understated -- conservatively you can add another $30 billon 
or more to the total," warned Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Issue Required 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan, which will be formally presented to Congress today by 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, depends on a bond issue and premiums 
collected from savings institutions for the financial rescue. 
</P>
<P>
The total price has been estimated at $126 billion over 10 years. Besides the 
outlays to shut insolvent S&amp;Ls and help finance new mergers, the package 
includes $52 billion to cover future costs of sales and mergers that have 
already been consummated. 
</P>
<P>
Specific details of the plan, including the amount to be spent on future 
S&amp;L closures, were issued Tuesday by the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration plan is directed at 350 insolvent institutions in which 
liabilities exceed assets. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred more may be solvent now, but are weak and unlikely to meet the 
tougher capital standards called for by the Bush program. "There are a lot more 
basket cases, and that's where I'm questioning whether they have enough money," 
Litan said. 
</P>
<P>
Rising interest rates will drive up the cost of doing business for these weak 
institutions because they will be compelled to pay higher rates to attract 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Although outlays would extend over a decade, the centerpiece of the Bush plan 
is a special bond issue to provide federal regulators with funds quickly to 
shut down insolvent institutions. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress approves the Bush program, $50 billion in bonds would be sold over 
the next three years to provide immediate cash. The balance of the $126 billion 
would come from premiums paid by financial institutions and from approximately 
$40 billion in taxpayer funds. 
</P>
<P>
However, some experts say the short-range need is greater than $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"That is clearly not enough," said Bert Ely, a financial consultant. "They 
should have gone for $65 billion. " 
</P>
<P>
The money "doesn't come fast enough," Ely said. More funds will be needed to 
close weak institutions that engage in costly rate wars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ailing S&amp;Ls commonly offer unusually high rates of interest to attract 
deposits, a policy that drives up costs for the rest of the industry, hurting 
the healthy S&amp;Ls by forcing them to pay extraordinary rates to stay 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The federal savings and loan insurance fund, which guarantees deposits up to 
$100,000, is currently insolvent. Regulators have been forced to permit many 
crippled S&amp;Ls to stay in business because there is not enough money to shut 
them down. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Bush plan, regulation of S&amp;Ls is shifting to the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., which oversees the safety of bank deposits up to $100,000. The 
FDIC already is moving to seize control of more than 200 insolvent institutions 
while waiting for Congress to act on the Bush plan. The former S&amp;L 
regulator, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., will provide personnel 
to work under FDIC leadership. 
</P>
<P>
This extraordinary concentration of regulatory power was sharply questioned 
Tuesday by Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.), chairman of the subcommittee that will 
write the S&amp;L rescue legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Annunzio said the FDIC's "current level of supervision over the banks that it 
insures is inadequate." In Texas, for example, the FDIC is responsible for 617 
banks, but has not examined 73 of those banks since 1985, he said in a 
statement on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDIC already insures $1.68 trillion in 8,400 banks, and I am concerned 
that it is too overextended to take on new work," said Annunzio, who is 
chairman of the financial institutions subcommittee of the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Can a federal banking agency that in the past two years has not conducted . . 
. examinations of hundreds of banks under its supervision, " he asked, "be 
trusted with additional supervisory authority over thousands" of S&amp;Ls? 
</P>
<P>
Annunzio's subcommittee will conduct a quick investigation of FDIC regulation 
of banks. The subcommittee "needs to determine whether the FDIC can handle its 
own work, let alone other agencies' work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said "auditing 
firms must share substantial blame for the S&amp;L crisis." 
</P>
<P>
The independent accounting firms failed badly in neglecting to identify bad 
loans that were uncollectible, Frederick D. Wolf, assistant comptroller 
general, told the committee.

JAMES FLANIGAN: BUSH CAN SHOW HE'S NO 'WIMP' ON TRADE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With President Bush and the U.S. TV network news shows in Japan this week for 
the emperor's funeral, we're getting a lot of comment on industrial 
competitiveness and trade issues -- much of it disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, got a head start last week in criticizing 
U.S. trade policy -- which, by one report, he called a "trade policy for 
wimps." The focus of Iacocca's anger was the U.S. Treasury's decision last week 
to classify imported trucks as passenger vans, allowing them to come in under a 
much lower tariff. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles in question don't meet U.S. safety or emissions standards for 
passenger vehicles; they meet only the less stringent standards for trucks -- 
which obviously is what they really are. Yet the U.S. government yielded to 
European and Japanese lobbying and said that Nissan, Volkswagen and Mitsubishi 
vans could come in as passenger vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Since Chrysler gets much of its profit from mini-vans and Jeeps, and will be 
directly affected by the ruling, Iacocca was speaking his own case. But he 
happens also to be right. The Treasury ruling was another example of the United 
States acting like a sucker on auto trade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parts Imports Increasing 
</P>
<P>
Last year the U.S. trade deficit on automotive products was $49 billion -- more 
than one-third of the total U.S. trade deficit. Roughly $25 billion of that 
auto deficit was with Japan -- which shipped $20.5 billion worth of cars to the 
United States and more than $4 billion in auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
And the deficit is unlikely to shrink because auto parts imports are 
increasing, even though car imports -- discouraged by the high yen and a 
glutted U.S. market -- aren't increasing. The trade problem is changing 
direction, explains one auto expert. As Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, 
Mazda and Isuzu set up or expand production in the United States -- a welcome 
event in many ways -- the U.S. auto parts industry is threatened by new 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese manufacturers all claim that at least 50% of the value of their 
U.S.-produced cars originates locally -- but that's a smoke screen. The 50% 
local content counts wages paid as well as advertising expenditures, even 
payments to lobbyists. Meanwhile, the windshields and spark plugs and other 
auto parts are brought in from Japan, establishing U.S. beachheads for Japanese 
parts suppliers but threatening the parts industry here. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the U.S. government is too timid or dimwitted to question such things, as 
governments elsewhere do, says auto analyst Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager 
Dietz &amp; Birney, a New York investment firm. To be sure the issue is 
complex, she adds. Often U.S. parts makers don't measure up on quality -- as 
U.S. cars didn't in the past. So U.S. parts makers need to improve to get the 
new Japanese business as well as to hold onto their existing U.S. customers. 
But they may not improve unless they get a shot at the new business. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denounced by Japanese 
</P>
<P>
The challenge to parts makers is yet another instance of industry going global 
and changing traditional patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes paradoxically so, as with Iacocca. The flamboyant Chrysler chairman 
is often denounced by Japanese executives for speaking one way, acting another. 
"Iacocca always complains but he himself doesn't contribute much to solving the 
trade deficit," observes Tetsuo Chino, head of Honda's North American 
operations. "He imports cars and components from Japan and Mexico and (South) 
Korea." True enough, Chrysler markets Eagle cars made by Renault of France and 
will distribute cars made in Canada by Korea's Hyundai. It owns 24% of 
Mitsubishi Motors, with which it is setting up a production venture in 
Bloomington, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
What's Iacocca's game? He's doing what he can to keep Chrysler in the race and 
free from takeover. For Chrysler is not quite big enough to be independent long 
term. Analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. suggests that it might be 
acquired by Fiat of Italy, which needs a strong presence in North America. More 
likely is a closer hookup with Mitsubishi, which needs Chrysler as much as 
Chrysler needs it. 
</P>
<P>
What both those companies lack are the worldwide scope of such as Ford and 
General Motors -- which loom almost as large in Europe as in U.S. car markets. 
In Japan, Ford owns 25% of Mazda and GM owns 34% of Isuzu. Truly, in global 
industry, a company's national identity is not a simple matter. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't stop other countries from recognizing, and fighting for, their 
national interests. In the mini-van case, the U.S. Treasury heard from 
government ministers of Britain, West Germany and Japan -- with the German 
finance minister, ostensibly in Washington to discuss high-flown currency 
questions, making sure to put in a word for Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government doesn't do that as readily or skillfully for U.S. business 
-- with the result that trade deficits are chronic and U.S. companies seem 
always to be set up for global target practice. 
</P>
<P>
Well, U.S. car makers have met and matched world competition and so can U.S. 
auto parts producers. But it wouldn't hurt if George Bush pressed Japan this 
week to give American parts makers more of a shot at the U.S. business of 
Toyota, Honda and the rest. Maybe he can show that on trade policy, he's no 
wimp.

investor Eli Jacobs. Terms of the purchase of Worlds of Wonder Inc., which will 
be in cash, debt and preferred stock, were not disclosed. The investor group 
plans to continue operating the company and Worlds will emerge from Chapter 11 
upon court approval of the plan, it said. The Fremont, Calif., toy maker filed 
for federal bankruptcy protection in December, 1987.

DOLE EXTENDS OLIVE BRANCH TO AFL-CIO LEADERS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR SECRETARY'S TONE FAR DIFFERENT FROM REAGAN ERA 
</P>

Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole launched President Bush's "kinder, 
gentler" era with America's unions Tuesday by telling the AFL-CIO executive 
council here that she has "great respect both individually and collectively" 
for them and that she will run a "people's department." 
</P>
<P>
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland referred to Dole as "a personal friend," with 
whom he hoped labor could pursue some common objectives. "I think her motives 
are sound, her objectives are laudable. I think she wants to be a good 
Secretary of Labor." 
</P>
<P>
The tone of the first meeting between the leaders of the labor federation and 
Dole contrasted sharply with the first such session of the Reagan presidency, 
when Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan and the union leaders clashed publicly 
over the President's economic plans. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland acknowledged that he was "certain" there will be some areas of 
disagreement. But he did not offer any specifics, and Dole scrupulously avoided 
responding to questions to any controversial topic in a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, she would not comment on the current labor dispute at Eastern 
Airlines. Monday, the AFL-CIO executive council called on Bush to convene a 
Presidential Emergency Board that would review the situation and make 
recommendations toward a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications Tuesday that on at least one key issue -- an increased 
minimum wage, where there are long-time differences between labor and Bush, 
that there may be a compromise on the horizon. Dole reiterated Bush's position 
favoring a so-called Youth Opportunity Wage, as an accompaniment to an 
increased minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
The labor movement has traditionally opposed such a device as a "sub-minimum" 
wage, which would tend to cause employers to get rid of older workers so they 
could hire teen-agers for less money. 
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday Kirkland did not denounce the concept as he has in the past. He 
simply said he favored pending Democratic legislation to raise the minimum wage 
to $4.65 an hour over three years, up from the current level of $3.35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources in the AFL-CIO and the House of Representatives said that 
labor could be amenable to a "training wage" that would be limited to 
first-time workers for a relatively short period of time, perhaps 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Dole told the executive council and a news conference that "we must . . . 
ensure that the American workplace is as safe and secure as we can make it." 
She added, "We need to begin focusing now on prevention rather than just 
correcting past mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Dole praised the idea of joint union-management safety committees and raised 
the possibility of using more criminal sanctions against employers who violate 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act. However, Dole said she did not favor 
amending the law as some labor leaders would like to do, and she indicated that 
it might be a while before a new head of OSHA is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland raised a cautionary note on the Bush Administration's attitude about 
workplace safety. "It's all very fine to favor . . . the protection of the 
health and safety of workers on the job. But if that is not accompanied by an 
adequate inspection service and the rigorous enforcement of the laws, then it 
is lip service and little more." 
</P>
<P>
One "sticky area" for Dole in the meeting was the Administration's plan to lift 
the longstanding ban on industrial homework in various industries, according to 
Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
The AFL-CIO opposes lifting the ban on the grounds that it is easy for 
companies to exploit employees who work at home. The AFL-CIO executive council 
noted in a resolution Monday that an internal Labor Department memo raised 
serious questions about the department's ability "to effectively oversee and 
monitor industrial homework activities." 
</P>
<P>
Dole said, in response to questions, that the department would hold more 
hearings on the issue, including one in Los Angeles in late March. 
</P>
<P>
Dole's meeting with the council was not open to the press. But her aides 
distributed a copy of her remarks, which included praise for cooperative 
labor-management programs launched by several unions.

POLAROID BEGINS BUYBACK TO THWART SHAMROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polaroid on Tuesday launched the first step of a $1.1-billion stock repurchase 
designed to thwart a hostile bid for the company by Roy E. Disney's Shamrock 
Holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The instant photography giant came out with an $800-million, or $50-a-share, 
offer for as much as 22% of its stock. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid's tender offer apparently disappointed Wall Street traders and 
analysts, who had hoped that the company would offer as much as $52 a share. In 
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Polaroid was off 37.5 cents 
Tuesday to close at $43.375. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock buyback is planned to come in two steps. It is offering to 
buy up to 16 million of its 71 million shares for $50 each in the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, Polaroid wants to spend an additional $325 million to buy 
shares on the open market or through "privately negotiated purchases." That 
$325 million, however, is not being spent yet because it was raised through a 
private investment deal that Shamrock is trying to scuttle in court. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold, in a prepared statement, called the 
Polaroid offer a "coercive self-tender detrimental to Polaroid's shareholders." 
Shamrock, owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, Walt Disney's nephew, owns 4.9 
million shares of the Cambridge, Mass., company and is offering $3 billion, or 
$45 a share, for the stock it doesn't own. 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid's announcement that it is considering privately negotiated purchases 
of its stock set off talk on Wall Street that the company might be considering 
ridding itself of Shamrock by paying greenmail to the Burbank investment 
company. Greenmail is a payment by a takeover target to a potential buyer. In 
most cases, the takeover target pays the suitor a premium not offered to other 
shareholders in exchange for an agreement not to pursue the bid. 
</P>
<P>
A Polaroid spokeswoman said the company will not pay greenmail. And Gold has 
previously criticized the practice. But that failed to comfort some investors 
and analysts, who questioned why Polaroid would include a reference to a 
private share purchase if it weren't considering buying out Shamrock. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me nervous. The only privately negotiated transaction I can see is 
with Shamrock," said B. Alex Henderson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
With Polaroid's stock repurchase launched, Shamrock's options are getting 
fewer. The company's chief strategy is to try to unseat Polaroid's board at the 
company's annual meeting in May. 
</P>
<P>
But Polaroid's buyback plan makes that effort harder to accomplish. To succeed, 
Shamrock would need support from stockholders with slightly more than 50% of 
the outstanding stock, which could mean as many as 30 million shares. And 
Polaroid has placed stock with the voting power of 16 million shares in 
friendly hands: an employee stock ownership fund and an investment fund named 
Corporate Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Once the buyback is finished, the acquired shares presumably would be retired, 
and those friendly shareholders could have close to a 30% stake in the company. 
The Polaroid spokeswoman said employees will decide how much, if any, of the 
stock owned by the employee stock fund is tendered as part of Polaroid's stock 
repurchase. Since Polaroid employees are siding with management, it is widely 
believed that they will hang on to their shares to increase their clout. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Pasquarosa, the most vocal spokesman for Polaroid's 10,000 employees, said 
he could not predict how workers will react to the tender offer but said they 
do not want to lose the leverage they have in the takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
Shamrock's only other hope is to overturn both the sale of shares to the 
employee fund and to Corporate Partners in Delaware state court. So far, 
however, its efforts there have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Traders speculated that Shamrock, now bidding $45 a share for the stock it 
doesn't own, may raise its bid to as much as $52. But they also questioned the 
wisdom because it isn't clear whether Polaroid is worth that much. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is the uncertainty over how much Polaroid will recover in the 
damages phase of a patent infringement case it won against Kodak. The case 
stems from Kodak's venture into the instant photography business in the 1970s. 
Polaroid could win as much as $11 billion, but most analysts believe it will be 
less, probably $1 billion to $2 billion.

TWO NORTHROP UNITS COMBINE; 500 JOBS CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Corp. merged its Orange County plant with its division in Hawthorne on 
Tuesday, a move that will eliminate about 500 jobs within the next year, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The exact means of the reduction, whether layoffs, or attrition, or some 
combination of those, is under review," said company spokeswoman Maria 
Oharenko. "I have no idea whether Anaheim or Hawthorne will be most impacted." 
</P>
<P>
The company alerted employees in October that it was studying a possible 
merger, examining whether the electro-mechanical division in Anaheim and the 
electronics division in Hawthorne were compatible and could be combined to 
streamline operations and improve productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The aerospace giant said in a prepared statement Tuesday that the 
reorganization of its $1-billion electronics business entailed "streamlining 
the management structure and providing for closer technical interchange between 
its electronics and aircraft activities." 
</P>
<P>
The merged divisions will be based in Hawthorne and will operate under a 
relatively simple name for an aerospace unit: the Electronics Systems Division. 
The division will design and manufacture navigation and guidance systems and 
advanced sensors for aircraft, helicopters and missiles. Both the Anaheim and 
Hawthorne plants will remain in operation. 
</P>
<P>
Oharenko said that the reorganization and the layoffs were not caused by "a 
contract loss or another customer action." 
</P>
<P>
"Aircraft not only fly, but they have complex electronics in them," Oharenko 
said. The reorganization follows a trend toward "continuing integration of 
electronics and aircraft systems within the defense industry." 
</P>
<P>
The Anaheim operation employs about 2,000 workers and manufactures electronic 
sensing and optical devices. The Hawthorne division employs just under 3,000 
and specializes in navigation and guidance equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Operating profits from Northrop's various electronics divisions dropped to 
$38.7 million last year from the $70 million reported in 1987. Contract 
acquisitions also fell during 1988 to $812.8 million from $1.1 billion.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE'S SURVEILLANCE CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
CFTC CALLS SYSTEM FOR DETECTING ABUSES 'DEFICIENT,' SAYS INQUIRIES DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Tuesday that the scandal-plagued 
Chicago Board of Trade has a seriously "deficient" system for detecting trading 
abuses. The agency charged that investigations are delayed too long and ordered 
the Board of Trade to send its investigative logs to Washington on a monthly 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism focused on the effectiveness of the exchange's computerized trade 
surveillance system. 
</P>
<P>
Recent revelations of potentially massive scandals have focused public and 
regulatory attention on the Chicago Board of Trade and on the city's other 
major futures market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Federal investigations 
at both exchanges reportedly have uncovered widespread patterns of fraud 
involving rigged prices and phony bidding. 
</P>
<P>
The investigations, which are being conducted by the FBI and the U.S. 
attorney's office in Chicago, focus on futures trading in Treasury bills and in 
foreign currencies. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a 
specified quantity of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price 
on a set date in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover FBI agents working as traders at the Chicago exchanges reportedly 
found cases in which brokers completed transactions at prices above or below 
true market levels and then pocketed the difference. 
</P>
<P>
This type of abuse presumably should be detected by the board of trade 
investigative system. But the Board of Trade procedures were found lacking in 
speed and efficiency, according to the CFTC. 
</P>
<P>
The board was very slow in its handling of investigations of potential trading 
abuses, according to the CFTC study. These are carried out through a 
computer-assisted operation known as a Trade Practice Investigation, or TPI. 
The CFTC regulatory staff reviewed TPI cases and found "lengthy delays," 
according to its 145-page report. 
</P>
<P>
There were 292 completed cases, taking from four months to 22 months to close. 
However, 224 of the cases took more than one year from initial investigation to 
final action. 
</P>
<P>
"This represents an absence of control over the progress of TPIs and a lack of 
attention to closing cases promptly once investigative work has been 
completed," the CFTC report said. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, involving alleged prearranged trading in options on corn, the 
Board of Trade received a complaint on Oct. 6, 1986. But the two members 
involved were not interviewed until the following August and September, when 
the traders said essentially that they couldn't remember what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the CFTC report, the Board of Trade said Tuesday that it has 
"always cooperated fully with the CFTC in their reviews of our enforcement 
practices and we intend to do so with this review." 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said: "It should be understood that most of the 
material on which the report is based is more than 1 1/2 years old, and many of 
the CFTC's recommendations have been implemented." 
</P>
<P>
The board has increased the size of its audit office by 75% and "fully 
computerized our audit trail surveillance systems," he said. In addition, board 
committees have been "examining ways to enhance our audit trail, surveillance 
and disciplinary action capabilities," according to Mahlmann. 
</P>
<P>
The board has allocated $1 million to improve its computerized system, "which 
will allow us to audit 100% of all trades daily," he said. "That is tantamount 
to the Internal Revenue Service auditing 100% of all taxpayers in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The CFTC's division of trading and markets conducted the study, which covered 
the period from July, 1987, through April, 1988. CFTC staff met with Board of 
Trade personnel from April, 1988, until October and then examined a sample of 
investigative case files, market surveillance logs and audits.

GOVERNMENT SEEKS $5-MILLION FINE AGAINST ROCKWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said Tuesday that they will seek a $5-million fine against 
Rockwell International Corp. for overbilling the government on a sophisticated 
satellite navigation contract. 
</P>
<P>
In a sentencing report filed in Los Angeles federal court, the U.S. attorney's 
office said the stiff fine is intended "to send a message of unparalleled 
clarity to all defense contractors that fraud on the government -- and the lies 
and deception that go with it -- will not be tolerated as simply a cost of 
doing business." 
</P>
<P>
One of the two employees indicted in the case, Robert L. Zavodnik of Fountain 
Valley, was sentenced Tuesday to a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors did not seek a jail term in the case, citing Zavodnik's cooperation 
in the investigation after his guilty plea and the fact that his boss, Donald 
Carter, was acquitted at trial in December. Zavodnik claimed that Carter told 
him to cover up the overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell entered a conditional guilty plea last month to two felony charges in 
an indictment charging the company and the two employees with overbilling the 
Air Force by nearly $450,000 on contracts for the $1.2-billion NAVSTAR global 
positioning system. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea agreement, Rockwell admitted that it was in contempt of an 
earlier court order stemming from a previous overbilling case but reserved its 
right to appeal the present conviction by arguing that it had uncovered the new 
fraud itself and sought to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Attys. George B. Newhouse Jr. and Stephen A. Mansfield urged 
U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall to impose a fine commensurate with 
Rockwell's profits on the NAVSTAR project, which are projected at $176 million 
through the nearly 10-year life of the production contract. A hearing is 
scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell's overall net profits last year totaled $812 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, if the government is going to have an impact in cases like this, 
dealing with multimillion-dollar projects, you're going to have to have 
multimillion-dollar fines," Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors said an earlier admission in which Rockwell acknowledged 
shifting costs from the NAVSTAR project to the space shuttle project also 
warrants a substantial fine. 
</P>
<P>
"These sanctions will ensure that limited investigatory resources and court 
time need never again be used to prosecute the conduct of this large, publicly 
held corporation, which has no business now or ever standing as a convict 
before the bar of this court," the government said in its sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has maintained that top-level corporate officials had no knowledge of 
the double-billing scheme, which occurred at the company's Satellite Systems 
Division in Downey and Seal Beach. When evidence of wrongdoing on the part of 
employees at the division came to light, they said, Rockwell corrected it and 
reported it to the federal authorities under the government's voluntary 
disclosure program. 
</P>
<P>
Stung by the subsequent indictment, Rockwell reserved the right to appeal the 
guilty plea on the basis of allegations that the government acted improperly by 
indicting the company for conduct the company had voluntarily disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors say the company reported the overbilling long after 
government auditors began asking questions about it. Prosecutors also said in 
their sentencing report that there is evidence that at least some higher-level 
employees at Rockwell, including Global Positioning System program manager 
James R. Eyman, knew about either the overbilling or the cover-up. Eyman, who 
has not been charged, has denied any knowledge or participation in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"If the cover-up were truly hatched by Carter and Zavodnik acting alone, to 
serve some unarticulated interest of their own," the government's report said, 
"why would they tell their superiors exactly what they were doing, both in oral 
reports and written memoranda? 
</P>
<P>
"The only rational conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence is that 
corporate officials at Rockwell knew about the deception, knew that the 
auditors were being told lies and approved, if not directed, that course of 
action. There simply is no other credible explanation."

FIGHT OVER IRVINE DEFENSE CONTRACTOR; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN SMOKE CLEARS IN BANKRUPTCY, KATZ HOLDS HELIONETICS REIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Helionetics Inc. has emerged from bankruptcy after a bitter 2 1/2-year 
reorganization battle with former director Bernard B. Katz firmly back in 
control of the Irvine defense contractor. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, there were four groups vying for control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
But under a plan approved in bankruptcy court in Santa Ana, Katz and his wife, 
Susan E. Barnes, and George de B. Bell, a Katz business associate and chairman 
of the Philadelphia investment bank Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., will have 
controlling interest in Helionetics. 
</P>
<P>
They will own 3.5 million, or about two-thirds, of the firm's approximately 
5.25 million common shares outstanding, said Charles W. Jobbins, a former 
Helionetics president. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John E. Ryan on Friday approved the reorganization 
proposed by Jobbins and Katz, a Beverly Hills businessman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jobbins Chairman and CEO 
</P>
<P>
Jobbins, who retired in 1983, was immediately named chairman and chief 
executive officer of the company. Stanley J. S. Emeterio will continue as chief 
financial officer, the post he has held during the reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganized Helionetics is a much-changed company. Since filing for 
bankruptcy, Helionetics has divested most of its operations, including a 
promising unit that was developing high-energy laser communication systems for 
the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The principal remaining business is Delta Electronic Controls, a manufacturer 
of electronic power conversion equipment, primarily for military applications. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Delta was Helionetics' predecessor and itself was rescued from 
bankruptcy by Katz in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the Helionetics reorganization, several lawsuits filed after the 
company went into bankruptcy in July 1986 have been settled. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for Bank of America and Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn., 
Helionetics' largest secured creditors and parties to all of the suits, to 
accept $7 million -- about 41 cents on the dollar -- to settle their claims 
against the company. The two financial institutions were owed $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics' unsecured creditors will receive 500,000 shares of newly issued 
stock in the reorganized company. The value of the settlement to those 
creditors will depend on the future performance of Helionetics' stock. 
</P>
<P>
Existing shareholders will receive one share of stock in the new company for 
every 10 shares they own, said Don Rothman, an attorney for Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Jobbins, who had headed Helionetics in 1980-83, said Tuesday that he is 
optimistic about the company's prospects. He predicted sales of $6.8 million in 
1989 and $9 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We have close to a year's business in backlogs, and that's great for a company 
coming out of Chapter 11," Jobbins said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said Helionetics "will be on the alert" for buying other companies that 
complement its present business. 
</P>
<P>
Jobbins said Helionetics is seeking approval to have its stock relisted on the 
Pacific Stock Exchange. The stock had been suspended from trading during the 
reorganization. 
</P>

Well-Known Figures on Board 
</P>
<P>
Helionetics gained national attention in the early 1980s when Katz recruited an 
impressive list of well-known military and government figures to the company's 
board of directors. The list included Edward Teller, the Nobel Prize-winning 
physicist and principal developer of the hydrogen bomb; former Treasury 
Secretary William Simon, and David C. Jones, a retired Air Force general and 
former chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by its prestigious board and the promise of its laser technology, 
Helionetics stock soared to nearly $30 per share in 1983. But the stock fell to 
less than $1 a share as the firm's fortunes tumbled in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Former management blamed an overambitious expansion strategy, undertaken in 
1984, for the company's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the attention was focused on Katz, not the company. The investor is 
a controversial figure who was the target of a 1977 Securities and Exchange 
Commission inquiry into his stock promotion activities. 
</P>
<P>
Katz ran into problems at Helionetics in 1984, when Wendell Sell, a former 
Helionetics chairman, and Marvin Stern, a former consultant, accused him of 
violating federal securities laws and state fraud statutes. 
</P>
<P>
Katz, who denied the accusations in court filings, agreed to settle the suit in 
May, 1988, by paying $475,000 to Sell and Stern. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reorganization plan, several major shareholders, including Teller, 
who resigned as a director in 1986, will have their stock, which was being held 
as collateral by the company's creditors, returned to them. 
</P>
<P>
Teller will receive 33,700 shares, less than 1% of the total shares 
outstanding.

DATA ON PROPERTY LIENS MISLAID IN COMPUTER FOUL-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The secretary of state's office said Tuesday that it temporarily misplaced 
records of about 20,000 liens against commercial property in California, 
resulting in lenders receiving incomplete information about the 
credit-worthiness of potential borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
The records -- temporarily lost because of a computer foul-up -- have since 
been retrieved and restored, said Don Swails, an assistant division chief in 
the secretary of state's office in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the office has issued to lenders as many as 40,000 
certificates listing liens against the assets of commercial borrowers -- 
primarily businesses and professionals such as lawyers and doctors, Swails 
said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials don't know how many of those certificates were erroneous, he 
said. But it has clearly inconvenienced many lenders and financial research 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
"It has at least doubled our workload," said Richard E. Hall, general manager 
of UCC Network, a Sacramento firm that researches lien histories for lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that his office has had to check financial records of borrowers three 
and sometimes four times, because at least 30% to 50% of certificates requested 
by his firm in the past two months were probably incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the foul-up will subject the state to liability if 
lenders made loans based on incorrect information and those loans subsequently 
sour. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, lenders making loans secured by assets such as real estate will seek 
to know if liens have been placed against those assets. The type of loans 
affected by the foul-up are business loans because under the state's Uniform 
Commercial Code, records of liens issued against commercial assets such as 
business equipment, accounts receivable or inventory are kept at the secretary 
of state's office. Lenders may obtain the information for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
Records of liens against homes and furniture, which could affect the granting 
of mortgages, are filed with county recorders' offices. Records of liens 
against personal vehicles, which could affect granting of auto loans, are kept 
at the state Department of Motor Vehicles. Neither of those agencies was 
affected by the computer mishap. 
</P>
<P>
Swails said the affected liens were issued in November, December and possibly 
January. The office suspended issuance of certificates about two weeks ago when 
the problem was discovered, he said. Issuance of certificates should resume 
today, but it had not yet been decided if the office can reissue new 
certificates to all lenders who believe they have received erroneous ones, he 
said. The office already has a 30-day backlog in processing requests for new 
certificates, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real headache," Swails said. 
</P>
<P>
The office was hit by a similar computer malfunction in 1986, but it was not 
nearly as severe as the more recent problem, Swails said. He blamed the latest 
foul-up on a computer designed in the 1960s. A new computer system is scheduled 
to begin operating on a test basis at the end of March, he said.

JUDGE CALLS FOR MORE DAMAGES IN AMOCO SPILL

A retired judge Tuesday recommended a $30-million increase in his $85.2-million 
judgment against Amoco Corp. for oil-spill damage from the 1978 wreck of a 
supertanker off the French coast. 
</P>
<P>
The revised award would be shared by the government of France -- which would 
receive the single largest portion, $44.4 million -- and some 100 French towns 
affected by the spill that fouled 100 miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Frank McGarr, who retired as a U.S. District Court judge after his 1988 ruling, 
continues to serve as special master in the case and made the recommendation 
after being asked by parties in the case to reconsider the award. 
</P>
<P>
The recommendation is subject to approval by another federal judge; no date has 
been set for a final judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides objected to the revised award as well and vowed to appeal. None of 
the money has been paid. The towns had received $7.3 million in the original 
judgment and sought an additional $8 million but received only $200,000 more.

$202,240 IN JANUARY;

AVERAGE HOUSE PRICE UP 11% IN S.D. COUNTY

<P>
The average price of a single-family house in San Diego County rose by 11% 
during January to $202,240, up from $182,320 in December, and up by 30% from 
$155,438 in January, 1988, according to statistics provided by the San Diego 
Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rapid price increase, demand remained strong. The total resales of 
houses and condominiums was 1,095 in January, up 64% from the year-ago total of 
669, said Karen Rountree, spokeswoman for the realty board. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Chuck Hoffman said the 64% increase in total sales was "not as 
dramatic as it really appears." January statistics, which include houses 
brokered by member agents in the cities of San Diego, Chula Vista and El Cajon, 
reflect sales that were in the works in November and December. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a lot of people for some reason closed a lot of transactions at 
the end of the year, which is somewhat unusual . . . . I think it will take 
February's numbers to tell exactly what happened," Hoffman said.

INVESTOR SEEKS 50% STAKE IN CASABLANCA FAN FIRM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An investor has offered to purchase 50% of the stock in CasaBlanca Industries 
in City of Industry, company executives said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was received by Diana Corp., a Milwaukee firm that owns about 50% of 
CasaBlanca, according to Jerry Holland, CasaBlanca's chief financial officer. 
CasaBlanca's stock, which is traded on the American Stock Exchange, closed 
Tuesday at $8.875, down 62.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
CasaBlanca's subsidiaries produce ceiling fans, lamps, chandeliers and other 
lighting fixtures. Diana, a diversified company, owns retail sales operations 
in Wisconsin, Ohio and New York. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the offer and the identity of the bidder were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Corp. Chairman Richard Fisher said he did not know the value of the bid 
or the identity of the bidder. He said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., the New York 
investment house handling negotiations for Diana, would present the proposal 
later this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we found that the offer is terribly attractive, we probably wouldn't 
sell," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael McDonald, legal counsel at Diana, said the offer may have been prompted 
by a statement that Diana issued in November saying it was willing to consider 
offers for its stake in CasaBlanca. 
</P>
<P>
The prices of the zinc and nickel used in ceiling fans and some lamps have 
risen 50% during the past 12 months, hurting the company's bottom line, 
according to John Pearson, CasaBlanca's controller. 
</P>
<P>
For the six months ended Dec. 31, CasaBlanca lost about $387,000 on sales of 
about $30.2 million, Pearson said. For the 12 months ended June 30, CasaBlanca 
earned about $3.3 million, compared to $4.1 million during the previous year.

COMPOSER FINDS HIS PATIENCE PAYS OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Anaheim composer Ric Flauding's "Refuge" album, the road to record-store 
shelves has taken more than a few twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
Flauding admits that the slow pace has been frustrating -- more than 2 years 
between the time he started recording and the album's release last month. But 
he says it was worth the wait: "Refuge" seems to be taking off, getting regular 
airplay on 125 stations across the country, including jazz-oriented KKGO-FM 
(105.1) and new-age KWVE-FM (94.7) in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It all started in late 1986, when Flauding, who also plays guitar and 
keyboards, and sound engineer John Fischer found themselves with time on their 
hands after losing their jobs at a video company that was scaling back its 
audio production department. 
</P>
<P>
Between free-lance assignments, primarily scoring corporate videos and slide 
shows, the two began recording Flauding's compositions in Fischer's home studio 
in Stanton. They weren't thinking album at the time: Flauding hoped to sell the 
tunes to other musicians, and he shopped his demos to record companies. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't get any bites, but by the end of 1987 he had put together eight 
songs. "I decided to put it out on my own," Flauding said, so he had 500 
cassettes with black-and-white covers made up. Last March, he decided to take 
another stab at attracting record company interest -- and ended up signing a 
three-album deal with Burbank-based Spindletop Records. 
</P>
<P>
But the wait wasn't over. Several scheduled release dates for "Refuge" came and 
went, until finally the instrumental album hit the record stores on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel better now when people ask me what I've been doing for the last 2 
years," said Fischer, 34, billed as co-producer on the album. "At least I have 
something to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
For Flauding, 35, recording his own album after years as a work-for-hire 
composer was a liberating experience: "It certainly was a pleasure sitting down 
and not having someone looking over my shoulder and telling me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Flauding's eclectic musical background includes performing in garage and Top-40 
bands, studying jazz and classical guitar (one of his teachers was jazz star 
Barney Kessel), composing chamber music, working as a staff arranger and 
orchestrator for the Crystal Cathedral, studying film scoring at UCLA and 
working for Yale Video in Anaheim, where he met Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
On "Refuge," he plays synthesizer and guitar, with lots of help on saxophones 
from in-demand session player Brandon Fields and local musician Keith Felch. 
Flauding calls the mellow, all-instrumental album "pop jazz," but Billboard 
magazine labeled the album "new age" in a Jan. 28 review. The record has been 
getting air play on both jazz and new-age stations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a new-ager from a theological standpoint by any means," Flauding said. 
But, he added, "it suits me as a player." While jazz tends to emphasize the 
player, he said, new age puts the focus on the composer. "I'm not a monster 
keyboard player," said Flauding, who considers himself a composer first. 
</P>
<P>
Although Flauding's musical interests are varied, the style of "Refuge" tends 
to reflect such favorite composers as Bob James, Dave Grusin and Bill Evans. "I 
would love to do a straight-ahead orchestral album," he said. But "if God stood 
before me and said I could do only one kind of music, this would be it. This is 
who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Flauding has assembled a band and performs occasionally in Los Angeles jazz 
clubs. "I love performing," he said, but he is a family man now and doesn't 
relish the idea of going on the road. He has toured with bands before, and "it 
gets tiring." But he will hit the road if the record company asks: "I'll do 
whatever I need to do to promote the album." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Flauding has written nine songs for the next album, and he and 
Fischer have started recording demos. "I've even thought about a couple of 
vocal cuts on the next album," Flauding said, emphasizing that he won't sing 
them himself. 
</P>
<P>
And the duo hasn't ruled out doing more sound-track work. "I need to make a 
living. I have a family," Flauding said. But, he added, "I would say that I 
love doing albums more than anything."

OUSTED MUSCOVITE WINS BALLOT SPOT

<P>
Boris N. Yeltsin, the ousted Moscow Communist Party chief and outspoken critic 
of party conservatives, won a spot today on the ballot to represent the capital 
in the new national legislature, Radio Moscow said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who lost the party job in 1987 after complaining about the slow pace 
of reform, received 532 votes at an electoral committee meeting that ended 
before dawn at the ornate House of Unions in downtown Moscow. Yevgeny Brakov, 
director of the giant ZIL automotive plant, received 570 votes and will compete 
with Yeltsin for one spot in the March 26 elections. Both were chosen by 
committee members from a field of 10 potential candidates to represent Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Because election law permits candidates to be nominated in more than one 
geographical area, Yeltsin also has been nominated in Sverdlovsk, where he 
could stand a better chance of election.

Anaheim police today are continuing their investigation into Tuesday's robbery 
and stabbing of a Loara High School student by three young men described as 
"skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Jose Irribarren, 18, was listed in fair condition 
today at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The school's principal, Gerald Glenn, said today that none of the suspects are 
Loara students. He said that the 3:30 p.m. attack occurred in front of the 
school, almost an hour after classes had finished, and that few people remained 
on the grounds. The school has not had any previous similar incidents, and the 
student body has not had any problems with "skinheads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
No additional security was planned at the school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Tuesday that the victim received two stab wounds to the leg and 
abdomen. He was stabbed with a "butterfly" knife, which flips open with a flick 
of the wrist, they said. It was not known how much money was stolen from the 
victim. 
</P>
<P>
The attackers were identified as three boys, ages 16 to 17, with shaved heads, 
leading police to identify them as skinheads. The attackers were described as 
white males, between 5 foot 3 inches and 5 foot 7 inches tall, and each 
weighing 120 to 170 pounds, police said.

A nurse was shot to death in a hail of gunfire when her car was ambushed as she 
left a patient's home in the Hollywood Hills above Studio City, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old victim, whose name was not released, was shot at 6:45 a.m. as 
she was driving home after completing an overnight shift, Los Angeles Police 
Lt. Ron LaRue said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently waiting for the woman, the gunman opened fire as she drove through 
the 7400 block of Woodrow Wilson Drive near Mulholland Drive, investigators 
said. The victim was shot several times, including at least once in the head. 
The woman was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where she died at 
11 a.m., following surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A motive for the shooting was under investigation. No arrests were made, and 
police were searching the area for the gunman.

POLICE SEEKING LONG BEACH REAL ESTATE BROKER IN SLAYING OF RIVAL 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police today were seeking Long Beach real estate broker Vincente Lapid OCampo 
for murder in the death of a rival broker last week. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charges were filed at the Long Beach district attorney's office 
against 45-year-old OCampo after police discovered blood on the carpet of his 
West Willow Street office that apparently matched that of Arlene Lee Chee, 46, 
of Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Chee disappeared last Wednesday after leaving her offices at Century 21 Fortune 
Realty in Long Beach for a noon appointment with OCampo. Chee's body was found 
Thursday night in the trunk of her Mercedes-Benz. She had been shot once in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
OCampo was one of Chee's first employees when she opened her office in the 2500 
block of Pacific Avenue in Long Beach in 1982. Chee fired OCampo that same year 
and he set up his own real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Police said OCampo may have been angry with Chee because she recently hired one 
of his agents. Police believe OCampo may have fled the Los Angeles area.

government said today in a report that the Federal Reserve chairman called 
disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets fell sharply in a reaction to the report and the Fed's 
comments about it. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks closed down 
42.50 points. (Details on Page 3.) 
</P>
<P>
Propelled by higher costs for food, energy and a variety of other goods and 
services, the seasonally adjusted increase in the consumer price index doubled 
the moderate 0.3% gains of November and December, the Labor Department said. 
</P>
<P>
January's rise, if it persisted for 12 months, would amount to an annual 
inflation rate of 7.2%, a dramatic increase from the 4.4% posted for both 1988 
and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Inflation 'Accelerating' 
</P>
<P>
"Inflation is accelerating, pure and simple," said economist Allen Sinai of the 
Boston Co. "It shows some signs of lurching out of control. Any way you cut 
that report, inflation was everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before a House Banking subcommittee 
today, called January's gain "disturbing" and said the rising prices were 
probably the result of accelerating wage increases. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan reaffirmed his view that the risks in the economy appear to be on the 
side of inflation, which could build if any attempt is made to lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is getting a little bit jittery," said economist Dan Seto of Nikko 
Securities Co. International Inc. in New York. "The market will look for the 
Fed to put more pressure on interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's 0.6% increase in consumer prices was the biggest jump since a 0.7% 
rise in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Higher prices for fuels, poultry, fish and eggs, coupled with a sharp advance 
in tobacco prices, accounted for much of the price acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Costs Up 0.7% 
</P>
<P>
Food costs were up 0.7% and energy costs rose 0.8%. Even excluding those two 
volatile categories, consumer prices were up 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Increased food prices were attributed in part to aftereffects of last summer's 
drought, but also to generally higher costs of doing business, including rising 
distribution and packaging expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Rising energy prices were pinned to higher costs for crude oil. Gasoline costs 
were up 0.9% during the month after dropping 1.6% in December. . 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest increases last month came in costs for tobacco and other 
smoking products, which jumped 4.7% after major cigarette makers raised 
wholesale prices in December. 
</P>
<P>
The only two bright spots in January's report were clothing and housing costs. 
Apparel prices were down 0.1% as retailers continued to mark down winter 
merchandise. Housing costs rose a modest 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Sinai called the report sobering because "it is always unacceptably high 
inflation that gets the economy in trouble since it (inflation) drives the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than anyone would like or 
expects." 
</P>
<P>
"Those higher interest rates damage the economy as part of the price of getting 
inflation down," he said.

WRITERS PROTEST THREAT TO RUSHDIE

Hundreds of authors marched outside the Iranian Mission to the United Nations 
in New York today, and some of America's top writers, vowing not to show fear 
"in the face of intimidation," read excerpts from Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic 
Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The members of the National Writers Union, on the sidewalk across from the 
mission, carried signs saying, "Free Speech Is Fundamental" and "Hands Off Our 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
"I write controversial books. What publisher is now going to take chances with 
a controversial book?" asked activist Abbie Hoffman, one of about 300 writers 
marching in a driving rainstorm outside the Iranian mission. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has been targeted for assassination by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, who considered the novel an insult to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Union President Alec Dubro was rebuffed by security officers at the mission 
when he attempted to deliver a letter there expressing outrage at the death 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'So Cowardly' 
</P>
<P>
The writers then marched on two Fifth Avenue bookstores -- B. Dalton's and 
Barnes &amp; Noble. Both stores are owned by B. Dalton, one of the chains that 
has pulled the book from its shelves in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
"To see book stores caving in like that to demagoguery is horrifying. These are 
the largest book-sellers in the country," said author Laura Shapiro. "They 
exist in honor of freedom of the press. For them to be so cowardly is 
despicable." 
</P>
<P>
Later today in New York, almost 1,000 people jammed the outside of the Columns 
meeting hall, where only 500 could be admitted under tight security, as 
prominent writers read excerpts from Rushdie's book. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 anti-Rushdie demonstrators marched across the street waving placards 
that read, "Down with Satanic Voices" and "Boycott Viking Penguin," Rushdie's 
publisher. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting of members of the 2,200-member writers' group PEN American Center 
included Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer, E. L. Doctorow, Joan Didion, Gay Talese, 
Robert Stone and Larry McMurtry. 
</P>
<P>
Sontag, president of PEN American Center, said the organization had been 
involved in the Rushdie controversy since India banned the book last October. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she said, "We all have learned how easy it is to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
"But if we show fear in the face of this intimidation, all of our institutions 
that support a free, literate society are hijacked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie sent his greetings to the meeting in a message delivered through his 
British publisher in which his American wife, poet Marianne Wiggins, told the 
group that she and her husband are in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
"We writers are a dangerous breed and always have been, and only fear can stop 
a writer writing and a publisher from publishing his work," she said.

FORMER KLAN LEADER SWORN IN AS MEMBER OF LA. LEGISLATURE

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke overcame two last-minute efforts to block 
him from taking his newly won seat in the Legislature today and was sworn in as 
a member of the Louisiana House. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Odon Bacquet objected to letting Republican Duke take his seat, claiming 
that he did not meet the residency requirement, but Bacquet's tactic failed 
when the House voted 69-33 to table his motion. Duke, who now heads the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of White People, then was sworn in. Outside 
the Capitol, about 25 students -- both black and white -- chanted "Don't seat 
Duke, keep Duke out." 
</P>
<P>
Just before the House met, a state district judge in Metairie, which includes 
Duke's district, refused a request by defeated House candidate John Treen for a 
restraining order to prevent his taking the seat. Treen appealed to the state 
Supreme Court.

CAN'T SUE NEGLIGENT OFFICIALS IN ABUSE CASES, COURT RULES

<P>
The Supreme Court ruled today that public officials may not be sued when their 
gross negligence permits a child to be abused by a parent. 
</P>
<P>
By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a state does not have a constitutional duty to 
protect people, including abused children, who are not in the state's custody. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said, "As a general 
matter . . . we conclude that a state's failure to protect an individual 
against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the 
(Constitution's) due process clause." 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual emotional dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun exclaimed, "Poor 
Joshua! It is a sad commentary upon American life and constitutional principles 
. . . that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the 
remainder of his life profoundly retarded" and without an opportunity to sue 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers were accused of violating Joshua's constitutional rights by 
failing to come to his rescue after repeatedly receiving evidence that he was 
being beaten. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not a Duty 
</P>
<P>
But Rehnquist said the state's awareness of the boy's plight does not mean it 
has a duty to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
Only "when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there 
against his will" does the Constitution require officials to take 
responsibility for the individual's safety and well-being, Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
"While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the 
free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to 
render him any more vulnerable to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day 
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justices William J. Brennan 
and Thurgood Marshall joined Blackmun in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taken to Hospital 
</P>
<P>
A suit in Joshua's behalf was filed against the Winnebago County, Wis., 
Department of Social Services and two of its employees after Joshua was treated 
at a hospital for head injuries that destroyed half his brain, leaving him 
profoundly retarded and institutionalized for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
A social worker had visited the DeShaney home on March 7, 1984, a day before 
the severe beating, and was told that several days earlier Joshua had fainted 
in the bathroom for no apparent reason. But according to court records, the 
social worker did not ask to see the boy. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to two to four 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Supreme Court ruling upheld a federal appeals court decision that threw 
out the suit. 
</P>
<P>
In another case decided today, the court ruled that states may not prohibit 
political party leaders from endorsing primary election candidates. The 
justices, by an 8-0 vote, struck down a California law as an impermissible 
infringement of constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The court also 
struck down as unconstitutional California laws limiting the term of office for 
party leaders and dictating the makeup of state party central committees.

Pan Am Corp. announced today it is offering a $99 one-way fare from East Coast 
points to cities in the continental United States, Western Europe and Central 
America. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the special fares, passengers must travel on Pan Am between Feb.

<P>
The $99 one-way fare is based on the purchase of a $198 round-trip ticket.

<P>
The special fares are in effect for travel starting between April 4 and May 17. 
All tickets must be purchased by March 3. 
</P>

Europe is available on eastbound flights on Sunday through Wednesday and on 
westbound flights on Monday through Thursday. Weekend travel is permitted for a 
$50 surcharge each way. 
</P>
<P>

The Supreme Court, in a victory for the federal government, today made it 
easier for some creditors to collect more money from companies that declare 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The court, by a 5-4 ruling in a case from Detroit, said the government is 
entitled to certain interest payments on taxes owed by a bankrupt company. 
</P>
<P>
The case stems from a petition filed by Ron Pair Enterprises before a 
bankruptcy judge in Detroit in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the company owed it $53,278 in taxes, penalties and 
interest accrued before the filing of the bankruptcy petition. 
</P>
<P>
The company agreed to pay the amount but refused to pay additional interest 
accrued after the filing of the petition. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the company should pay the post-filing interest because the 
collateral, tax liens on company property, that secure the debt owed the 
government exceed the amount of the original debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court today agreed, and overturned a ruling by the U.S. 6th Circuit 
Court of Appeals against the government. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, in his opinion for the court, said the bankruptcy 
code, which was revised by Congress in 1978, permits post-filing interest 
payments in such cases.

Foreign trade failed to make headway in 1988 due to production of shoddy goods, 
a fluctuating international economy and a failure of joint ventures to perform 
as expected, a newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year did not see any considerable rise in Soviet foreign trade, estimated 
at 132 billion rubles ($213.8 billion)," the Government Herald said. 
</P>
<P>
It said a drop in prices for basic fuel and raw materials and growing 
protectionist trends in Western countries made international markets 
unfavorable for Soviet goods over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, Soviet industry continues producing planes, vehicles, tractors and 
agricultural machines whose specifications differ very little from previous 
models and which are inferior to Western types," the Government Herald said.

Sammy Davis Jr., who stars with Gregory Hines in the current movie "Tap," is 
starting a new line -- a line of food products. 
</P>
<P>
Davis will hit supermarket shelves in April with his own brand of barbecue 
sauce, chili and mustard. The products will appear first in Pennsylvania and 
Ohio, then go national in the fall. "The mustard is tangy, but not too hot," 
said Davis. "The sauce has a nice little twang to it, but not too much, enough 
so that you can taste it." Davis' venture into cuisine follows a similar move 
by actor Paul Newman, whose face appears on his popcorn, spaghetti sauce, 
lemonade and salad dressing.

A book that detailed alleged improprieties by coach Jim Valvano and the North 
Carolina State basketball program will not be printed because it did not meet 
the publisher's standards. 
</P>
<P>
Pocket Books, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, said today that the decision 
not to proceed with publication of "Personal Fouls" was made after a review of 
the manuscript with Peter Golenbock, the author. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts of the book, based on book jacket blurbs, were published in the News 
and Observer in Raleigh, N.C., last month. 
</P>
<P>
The book, according to the jacket, alleged improper gifts to players and grade 
changes. It also alleged that a player deliberately lost State's first-round 
game in the 1987 NCAA tournament to avoid detection for drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"Following completion of careful pre-publication review by the editors with the 
author, it was determined that the manuscript 'Personal Fouls' by Peter 
Golenbock did not meet the publishing standards established by Pocket Books," 
the publisher said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The university said Valvano would not comment on the publisher's decision.

Former Raiders coach Tom Flores today was named general manager and president 
of the Seattle Seahawks by team owner Ken Behring. He replaces Mike McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement at Seahawks headquarters followed more than a week of 
speculation that Flores, 51, a longtime friend of the multimillionaire team 
owner, would be given the job. 
</P>
<P>
Behring said that he thinks the team of Flores and coach Chuck Knox can take 
the Seahawks to their first Super Bowl and that he is willing to bankroll the 
effort if they can produce a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to win," Behring said. "I'll pay the money if we can win." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knox Happy With Move 
</P>
<P>
Knox, who will work closely with Flores, said he is happy to have a former head 
coach as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a football man," Knox said. "He comes to Seattle with the knowledge of 
what it takes to win, from player personnel to coaching. I couldn't be happier 
with the selection with Tom Flores." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said he will not interfere with Knox's coaching duties. "I'm not going 
to tell Chuck how to coach his team," said Flores, who won two Super Bowls with 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
With the announcement, Behring, who along with partner Ken Hoffmann purchased 
the team from the Nordstrom family last year for an estimated $100 million, put 
to rest rumors that the job would be given to Mike Blatt of Stockton, the 
players' agent who brought the California land developer together with the 
Nordstroms. 
</P>
<P>
For the last month, Blatt had taken over most of the front office 
responsibilities formerly held by McCormack, the Seahawks general manager of 
six years, whom Behring fired Jan. 30, citing a "lack of communication." 
</P>
<P>
Behring said he chose Flores because he has known him since 1972 and believes 
that he is someone with whom he can communicate. 
</P>
<P>
Flores spent 22 years with the Raiders -- as a player, assistant coach and, 
from 1979 to 1987, as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were 91-56 in his nine seasons as head coach, including playoff 
games.

Harri Kirvesniemi of Finland took the gold medal after a furious finish in the 
men's 15-kilometer classic-style cross-country ski race today at the World 
Nordic Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Kirvesniemi, 30, one of the late starters in a field of 89 skiers, won the 
first major championship of his career by 3.3 seconds over Pal Gunnar 
Mikkelsplass, who is from Norway. 
</P>
<P>
A partisan crowd of 25,000 fans went wild as Kirvesniemi crossed the finish 
line in a time of 42 minutes 40.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 minutes earlier, Mikkelsplass had finished his race in 42:44.0. 
Mikkelsplass also was runner-up in this distance in the Olympics last year at 
Canmore, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Vegard Ulvang of Norway was third in 43:08.4, 27.7 seconds behind Kirvesniemi. 
Ulvang was a silver medalist in the 30K classic-style race Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Kirvesniemi's victory boosted host nation Finland's medal-leading total to four 
gold, three silver and three bronze medals. 
</P>
<P>
Aki Karvonen, another Finn, placed fourth, 37.1 seconds behind. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Boonstra of Burlington, Vt., was 41st in 46:29.5 for the best American 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Stone of Ketchum, Ida., was 47th in 47:00.4; Justin Wadsworth of La Jolla 
was 48th in 47:01.6, and Kevin Brochman of Park City, Utah, was 50th in 47:16.0 
out of 84 finishers.
