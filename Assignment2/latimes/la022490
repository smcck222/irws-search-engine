<P>
Regarding Charles Champlin's Feb. 8 column on who wrote Shakespeare's works: 
</P>
<P>
A group of graduate students, under my direction, have unearthed several 
dust-covered documents and pursued various phililogic and textual theories that 
have revealed an historic fact: Charles Champlin does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
One of my students has drawn up a lengthy article that shows, upon philological 
and semiotic analysis, that much of "Champlin's" articles are but a compilation 
of others: a snippet of Michael Wilmington's attitude, a graft of Kevin Thomas' 
esoterica, a collocation of Sheila Benson's critical vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
We don't know much about "Champlin's" origins. It surely cannot be that he had 
an uneventful childhood and adult life. A conspiracy of silence is going on in 
the Calendar section, and I have arrived to clear the air.

WOMEN ARTISTS AND REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Frankenthaler Retrospective Raises Questions," Feb. 9:. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Knight seems unable to review the exhibitions of internationally 
known women artists with any seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
When he reviewed the Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit last year, in the Herald 
Examiner, he called her "perhaps the most overrated American artist of the 20th 
Century" and attributed what he called her "gassily inflated reputation" to 
sexist tokenism. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Frankenthaler fared no better in his review in The Times. Knight 
questions why she was given the show at all and characterizes her entire ouevre 
as "a minor blip." Then, reusing the put-down he apparently reserves for 
world-class women artists, he calls her work "gassy and bloated." 
</P>
<P>
Readers -- and artists too -- deserve intelligent and serious art criticism, 
not superficial sarcasm.

FACES . . . : LIVING THE DREAM

<P>
"Meetin's on the Porch" at Beverly Hills' Canon Theater follows the stories of 
three women whose lives span the 20th Century. It's about ordinary lives and 
extraordinary events, and Carrie Snodgress, who's Amy in the play, knows a 
great deal about both. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Snodgress was working her way through college in the basement of a 
chemical company in Chicago, filling out shipping cards. She planned to be a 
teacher because, she says, "acting wasn't a profession. Acting was a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Then, everything changed. 
</P>
<P>
Director Alan Pakula saw Snodgress in a play and invited her to Los Angeles. 
Within a year, she starred in "Diary of a Mad Housewife." 
</P>
<P>
The film brought Snodgress two Golden Globes, an Oscar nomination and a phone 
message from rocker Neil Young. He'd seen Snodgress and wanted to meet her. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a rock 'n' roll girl," Snodgress remembers. "I said, 'Neil Young, 
Neil Young. Where do I know that name from?' " 
</P>
<P>
Snodgress and Young fell "madly and immediately" in love. Snodgress put 
Hollywood on hold and dedicated the next seven years to Young and their son, 
Zeke. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Hollywood to rediscover Snodgress has been tough. When the relationship 
with Young ended, Snodgress and her son returned to town. "I couldn't get into 
an office," says Snodgress. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors about drugs and alcohol, she says, but, even more damning, 
Snodgress had left her career at its height. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry wants you to be married to the industry. If you turn your back, 
if you go away once, then you're subject to doing that again any time in your 
career." 
</P>
<P>
Snodgress has worked a lot in TV and in plays. She's done a number of 
low-budget films, including the upcoming "Across The Tracks" with Rich 
Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to show the world, and this industry, the talent that's inside this 
girl. This girl? 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it funny that I called myself a girl? I'm still growing up, you know."

Not many people can think as fast as comic performer Reno talks. And when she 
does her act, an assault of talk titled "Reno Enraged" at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles, even the acerbic, kinetic whirlwind 
has trouble keeping up with herself. 
</P>
<P>
Reno (her complete name on and off stage) has emerged out of New York's network 
of performance art clubs and dens to become very visible. Her Los Angeles 
premiere comes in the wake of HBO's broadcast of her "Reno in Rage and Rehab" 
and a Rolling Stone notice as one of "1989's Hottest People." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people feel alienated from their environment," she says, "but it just 
so happens that I'm screaming about it. If I didn't approach things as funny, 
you might have known me as some killer on the rampage. I mean, up until about 
three years ago, I didn't think I was going to live long. I got into a lot of 
trouble," some of which she describes in her show. "I even spent time with the 
American Indian Movement in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I became immobilized just thinking about the world's problems. It was about 
'87 that I realized that, no matter what happened to me, life would go on. My 
only form of rebellion these days is not wearing a seat belt." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Reno was amazed that her friends stood by her. Friends, and her 
dog, are important to Reno. She photographed some of them for the just-released 
first issue of Egg magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Insisting that she's not a stand-up comic ("I don't do 1-2-3-joke"), Reno says 
her act tries to blend "the personal with the political." 
</P>
<P>
Will that go over well with the Hollywood deal makers she's currently meeting? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see. I'd like to make my live performance more visual -- for film, TV, 
whatever. I'll go after people in this country's power structure, but I don't 
want to judge people before I meet them." ROBERT KOEHLER

On Feb. 15, Calendar published a Jack Mathews news analysis under the heading: 
"Will the academy voters consider the year's angriest movie, 'Born on the 
Fourth of July,' to be the best? Don't bet on it." Would someone please tell 
Mathews that the Vietnam War was not fought against "the Red Menace." 
</P>
<P>
And when you do, please note that during the initial screenings of "Born on the 
Fourth of July," our great and noble country invaded Panama, another tiny, 
distant, foreign land. 
</P>
<P>
I think film editor Mathews really missed the point on this absolutely current 
motion picture masterpiece. Thus, he can be added to the immense list of those 
who can't see anything but what the government wants them to see.

<P>
The award-winning picture taken by Placentia amateur photographer Dick Krueger 
has become part of a permanent display at Eastman Kodak's Journey Into 
Imagination Pavilion at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The picture, titled "Flying Cowboy," won $200 for Krueger, an insurance sales 
manager, and was taken at a rodeo in 1988 at the Orange County Fairgrounds. It 
was chosen from about 500,000 entries. 
</P>
<P>
Krueger, 56, attends Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa and often works as a 
photographer for the college newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Katherine Parks, 37, a Huntington Beach single mother of three, was 
awarded $3,000 for academic excellence in a Kaiser Permanente nursing 
scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West College nursing student, who is expected to graduate in 
December and work as an emergency-room or intensive-care nurse, began to pursue 
a nursing career two years ago after the death of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided on a career in nursing," she said. "I had to ask myself, 'What is my 
family going to do?' and I knew it would need a good income." 
</P>
<P>
Her children are ages 5, 7 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Scaffidi of Placentia was awarded third place in the Arthritis 
Foundation's national photo contest. His photographs, like others in the 
contest, depict people in various activities, settings and situations conveying 
messages of hope for those with arthritis. They are on display at the Little 
Shop of Posters in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County men who led police to a accused purse snatcher hiding under 
a car in a Costa Mesa parking lot were declared Outstanding Citizens by the 
Newport Beach Villa Nova Restaurant and presented with commemorative plaques 
and complimentary dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Cirson, Richard Collins, Mark Vanous and Richard Henson combined to chase 
the suspect by car and on foot. 
</P>
<P>
Danny Herrera, a Golden West College cosmetology student competing against 45 
other contestants, won first place and $300 in the recent Men's Hair Cutting 
and Styling Competition at the Long Beach Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of the cut, I realized that most of the other contestants were 
styling (hair) the same way as me," said the Huntington Beach resident, who 
changed the style midway through the event. "Obviously, it paid off." 
</P>
<P>
Golden West student Don Anderson of Yorba Linda won fourth place and $25. 
</P>
<P>
A photo portrait of Jewell Plummer Cobb, the soon-to-retire president of Cal 
State Fullerton, has become part of the National Research Council's collection 
in its headquarters building in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The council selects outstanding people who have become leaders in the fields of 
science, engineering and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
An innovative program that provided free picture books for newborn infants at a 
local hospital earned Clinton Elementary School in Garden Grove a "Celebrate 
Literacy" award from the International and Orange County Reading associations. 
</P>
<P>
The school's "Born to Read" program consisted of a school paper drive and book 
sale to raise $150 to purchase storybooks for each infant born at Garden Grove 
Hospital and Medical Center during Children's Book Week last year. 
</P>
<P>
The project was intended to emphasize reading throughout a person's life. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia resident Larry D. Banares, culinary arts instructor at Orange Coast 
College and executive chef at the Hotel Queen Mary and Port Properties in Long 
Beach, was named Orange County's Chef of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
A former culinary arts student at the college and a former chef at the 
Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, Banares, 31, oversees 12 restaurants and three 
bakeries, supervising a staff of 124. 
</P>
<P>
He is a member of the World Assn. of Cooks' Societies and is vice president of 
the Orange Empire Chefs' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Park Ranger Eric Johnson won the city's third $500 graffiti award 
following the arrest and conviction of a suspect who was spray-painting at 
Brookhurst Park. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson asked for the suspect's driver's license after noticing that the man 
placed a spray can in his jacket. He then called police, as making arrests is 
not part of a ranger's duty. 
</P>
<P>
Besides receiving three years' probation, the suspect paid a $300 fine and $435 
in restitution fees.

PAMYAT, ISRAEL AND SOVIET JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One ugly aspect of the Soviet Union's greater toleration of political pluralism 
has been the emergence of far-right groups whose stock in trade is 
hatemongering and fomenting ethnic strife. Perhaps the most notorious of these 
is Pamyat, a Great Russian nationalistic movement whose anti-Semitic advocacy 
evokes chilling reminders of Russia's recent past. Now, reports a Soviet 
weekly, the Moscow prosecutor's office has begun proceedings against Pamyat 
under a section of the criminal code that forbids agitating to restrict the 
rights of others. The case, if it's pursued, could provide a key test of how 
minority rights will be protected in the new Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Soviet Jews, however, don't want to wait for the results 
of that test. Instead, they want out, and quickly, a desire strengthened by 
recent violence and threats directed against Jews in Moscow and other major 
cities. The natural destination for these people is Israel, which is eager to 
welcome them. But flights out of Moscow are booked through next fall and the 
Soviets, yielding to Arab pressure, now refuse to ratify an agreement for 
direct air links between Moscow and Tel Aviv. It should be noted that Arab 
pressures increased markedly after Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir let 
go with some loose talk that seemed to suggest new immigrants might soon be 
flooding into the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
History forbids ignoring anti-Semitic threats from Pamyat, or dismissing the 
rising sense of foreboding among Soviet Jews. In the uncertain Soviet political 
climate, accelerated Jewish emigration should be facilitated to the maximum 
extent possible. But the agitated political climate in and around Israel must 
also be taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position has long been that moving Israelis onto the West Bank -- 
including new Soviet immigrants -- undercuts opportunities to negotiate any 
Israeli-Palestinian political accord. This is the correct position to take. 
Possibilities do exist for speeding up the flow of Jewish emigrants from the 
Soviet Union, and certainly there are places in Israel proper where they could 
be housed. Those prospects might be helped along considerably if the Israeli 
government would make unequivocally clear that new immigrants would not be 
settled on the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Fairchild's column: 
</P>
<P>
Finally someone has written the truth about what Louis Farrakhan and the Nation 
of Islam represent. They represent a positive black role model for the African 
American. 
</P>
<P>
Although many may be skeptical about the religious practices, the African 
American community praises Minister Farrakhan for providing hope and 
encouragement for a productive and prosperous community. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Minister Farrakhan is feared by Americans is because he exposes the 
racial prejudice and white supremacist attitude that this country was built on. 
This attitude is rooted deep in the American ideology. Fairchild used the 
murder of Oliver Beasley, a member of the Nation of Islam, at the hands of a 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy as an example of the racist attitudes that 
are prevalent today. This must change. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild's analysis of the Nation of Islam clarifies the negative 
misconceptions expressed by the media. Fairchild recognizes the need for 
Farrakhan to find less antagonistic means in expressing his concerns regarding 
the Jewish community. However, Fairchild points out that more attention is 
focused on Minister Farrakhan's so-called verbal attacks on the Jewish 
community than on the Israel-South Africa connection. It is obvious that the 
Israel-South Africa connection has greater ramifications throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with Fairchild in regards to the fact that Farrakhan is much harder, 
verbally, on the African American community in comparison to the Jewish 
community. More media attention should be focused on the positive influence 
that Minister Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam bring to the African American 
community.

SOUTH AFRICA FREES MANDELA

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the long-overdue reforms are finally being established in South 
Africa, we must not make the mistake of forgetting the role that America played 
in apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the time comes that South African blacks possess civil rights equal 
to those of whites, the fact will still remain that there are American 
companies who refused to acknowledge the struggle for justice in South Africa 
by refusing to impose the sanctions which would undoubtedly have expedited 
these reforms. In this sense, they are as guilty as those who violently denied 
millions of individuals the freedom and equality that is their fundamental 
right.

SEN. MONTOYA AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who passes final judgment on former state Sen. Joseph Montoya after his 
conviction should also look at the way he has pursued issues involving the poor 
people of his district. The image is in stark contrast to the one generated in 
the legal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
In our case, his efforts have been pivotal in a matter involving nearly 200 
low-income apartment tenants who reside alongside the San Bernardino Freeway. 
We have long been waging a battle to get Caltrans to erect a freeway wall in 
front of our complex for both environmental and safety reasons. For months the 
transportation agency turned a deaf ear to our pleas. 
</P>
<P>
When our tenants association first approached Sen. Montoya for help last 
November, he was then preoccupied with the preparation of his legal defense for 
his trial that was to start only a few weeks later. It would have been 
understandable if he had chosen not to give us his time. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did he send a field representative to our press conference, but he 
also arranged to have Caltrans conduct long-sought noise testing. The upcoming 
results, which could lead to the wall, would not have been possible without his 
assistance. He never asked for anything in return. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate evaluation of Montoya's integrity should lie in how well he has 
represented those in his district who do not have a strong voice. Based on that 
criterion, I have more respect for Montoya than other lawmakers elsewhere who 
make it a regular practice to ignore the poor on vital issues of statewide 
concern.

SOUTH AFRICA FREES MANDELA

<TEXT>
<P>
On Feb. 11, a small bright spot appeared in the dark, gaping abyss called 
"White South Africa." A time to rejoice, yes, but it is also a time for a new 
beginning for the 23 million freedom fighters to attain what every living 
person should have: a right to stand up and be counted, to speak and resist 
freely. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Ronald Reagan's belief of the Soviet Union, white South Africa is 
the real "evil empire"; and it is still in power, still very lethal. What 
happens in South Africa affects South Africans most, but it also affects the 
entire world, economically and spiritually. In the words of our own Nelson 
Mandela, Dr. Martin Luther King: "An injustice to someone, somewhere, is an 
injustice to everyone, everywhere."

GERMAN UNIFICATION AND WORLD PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My overwhelming reaction when I read Jeff Douthwaite's letter (Feb. 9) was 
sadness. It's a shame that anyone has to harbor such irrational fears. 
</P>
<P>
To suggest that a reunified Germany would somehow be a military threat (or any 
kind of threat) to the rest of Europe in 1990 ignores present reality in favor 
of history. 
</P>
<P>
The Germany of 1914 had no tradition of democracy, but was ruled by the iron 
hand of the kaiser. And Hitler only had to kick the legs out from under the 
weak-kneed Weimar Republic, taking advantage of a decade of economic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast that with today's Federal Republic of Germany. The FRG is one of the 
most prosperous of the Western nations and has a two-generation-long tradition 
of democracy. What happened in 1933 is a virtual impossibility today. To 
suggest that Germans instinctively turn into militaristic aggressors whenever 
their country is unified borders on racism. 
</P>
<P>
There would be no need to impose a limit on Germany's military. With no 
appreciable threat left in the east, one would be hard-pressed to convince the 
Germans to fork up any cash for guns instead of butter. If Germany is going to 
do any conquering, united or not, it will be the field of economics, not the 
field of battle.

S. AFRICA-ISRAEL MILITARY TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jack Salem (letter, Feb. 14) criticizes Halford Fairchild ("Overcoming 
Captivity to the Worst in Us," Op-Ed Page, Feb. 2) for "singling out Israel" 
and its ties to South Africa. No matter how vehemently Salem and others seek to 
deny this, the history of Israel and South Africa manifests a bond between the 
two nations that distinguishes them from all others. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, comprehensive accords were signed by Israel and South Africa that 
created a standing ministerial committee that meets annually. Pursuant to some 
of these agreements, South Africa underwrites Israeli military research and 
development in exchange for a full range of modern weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the United Nations passed a mandatory arms embargo against South 
Africa. Israel has repeatedly violated this mandate, equipping the white 
minority government with a number of weapons, including missiles, several kinds 
of aircraft, long-range missile boats and other lethal equipment. Israelis have 
also trained South African troops and provided advisers to the apartheid state 
in its military attacks against Angola. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar value of Israel's military trade with South Africa have been 
published in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. In 1985, the 
figure provided was $250 million, while the estimate for 1986 was $400-$800 
million. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other nation, Israel has provided South Africa with the military 
wherewithal to oppress its black majority. African Americans who raise this 
issue are not anti-Semitic; they simply do not understand how Jews can justify 
cooperating with a government, many of whose members are not only racist, but 
also blatant Nazi sympathizers.

GERMAN UNIFICATION AND WORLD PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could it be that the rush for consensus between the Soviet Union and America 
over German unification portends a greater threat to world peace than 
politicians are willing to concede? Sure, the potential savings in troop 
budgets can help stem the red ink in both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. Certainly, too, 
West Germany is now well schooled in democracy and is showing itself ready to 
teach its Eastern brethren. But these are hardly reasons to believe that united 
Germans will not destabilize world peace and prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
The strengths of democracies rest in their functioning differently in different 
cultural environments to express their peoples' genuine desires. This cannot 
mean that democracies do absolute "good"; rather, if they are true democracies 
they follow their peoples' ideas, whether for "good" or "evil" in the rest of 
the world. It's not the governmental form that contributes to world peace; it's 
the content. Hitler, after all, manipulated the democratic German state by 
appealing to German cultural norms which had wide support in pre-World War II 
Germany and he achieved pre-eminence constitutionally. 
</P>
<P>
Hitler's "evil" was no more (nor less) than the realization through the state 
of his vulgar expression of German "greatness," "racial exclusivity," "manifest 
destiny," and "cultural imperialism" -- themes developed from great German 
artists and thinkers such as Nietzsche and Wagner -- and themes which had, and 
have, a wide following in the Germanys. As artistic or philosophic themes they 
can enliven and expand cultural surroundings; but, as exploited by popular 
politics, they can only refer back to Hitler's actions. The refrains of the 
militaristic "Deutschland Uber Alles" in the East and the West thus ominously 
reaffirm popular cultural ideas in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
Read in this larger context, the growing electoral power of right-wing parties 
in democratic West Germany over the past decade argues strongly against uniting 
Germans still holding notions of cultural supremacy. And, the sporadic violence 
against Jews and non-Germans (particularly Turks and Italians) which has 
peppered German society recently shouts that unification now would be a 
terrible mistake for Germany as well as the world. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the time to rush to consensus for the politically expeditious 
reasons obvious in the U.S. and Soviet accords. Rather, it is time to listen 
closely to the Europeans' judgments of the German popular cultural environment, 
which in the immediate past countenanced atrocities against them, and not to 
promote the threat to peace in German unification until they are satisfied that 
a united German democracy will express the positive aspects of the German 
cultural environment.

What disturbs me most about Melvin Durslag's column (Feb. 17) is that it 
utterly misses the whole point of the L. A. Marathon. In a spectator-oriented 
country where too many people are soft, unfit and unhappy with their physical 
conditioning, it's a wonderful thing to see 20,000 ordinary citizens get out on 
a Sunday morning to meet the challenge of a marathon.

In a city that has become habitually self-flagellating about all the things

<P>
I watched a great Loyola Marymount team recently embarrass the University of 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, before they discontinued their basketball program, partly due 
to the Quintin Dailey affair, USF had one of the proudest traditions on the 
West Coast -- if not the country. USF is still trying to dig out from under the 
Dailey scandal. Dailey's stint with the Lakers was also an embarrassment to him 
and the Lakers.

Quintin Dailey is a survivor, all right, but what he has left behind is nothing 
to be proud of.

Everyone knows that because Trevor Wilson cannot make two consecutive free

Given that: 1) Why was Wilson in the Stanford game with nine seconds left, and 
2) even if he was in, why did he get the ball?

Also, after missing the first free throw, why didn't he purposely miss the 
second? And, once he made the second, why wasn't a Stanford player immediately 
fouled?

Isn't there one answer, heretofore unmentionable, to the above four questions?

KING FAN HAS READ THIS SCRIPT BEFORE

<TEXT>
<P>
I've suffered with the Kings, or they have caused me to suffer, since 1967. 
I've seen them make trade after trade, giving up draft choices or young talent 
one after another. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, there comes this expansion team called the New York Islanders whose 
general manager says that he is going to build his team around young talent and 
draft choices with patience. 
</P>
<P>
A few years later, they obtained the services of one of the most popular Kings 
ever, Butch Goring, on their way to four Stanley Cups. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in their 23rd year, the Kings again have traded away their draft choices 
and young talent, and the Islanders are again building like they did then, with 
a lot of patience. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who's going to win the Stanley Cup again long before the Kings are? You 
guessed it.

EDDIE HART DIDN'T HAVE A LOCK ON GOLD MEDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Murray's claim (Feb. 15) that Eddie Hart was a shoo-in for the 100-meter 
dash gold medal at the 1972 Olympics was hardly based on facts. 
</P>
<P>
Murray dismisses Valery Borzov of the Soviet Union as though he were a 
second-rate sprinter, "with fast times at questionable places." 
</P>
<P>
Borzov was ranked fifth in the world in 100 meters in 1969, second in 1970 and 
first in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Hart was a fast but inconsistent sprinter. In 1972, he won two out of 
seven races at 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Borzov's Olympic victory over Robert Taylor marked the third year in a row he 
defeated the U.S. champion. The experts had no trouble ranking him No. 1 in the 
world for the second year in a row.

ESTANCIA IS ALL SMILES AFTER BEATING LOMPOC IN TRIPLE OVERTIME

<TEXT>
<P>
His hands were still shaking after it was over, but the grin remained on Tim 
O'Brien's face. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia High School's coach was smiling because the Eagles had just secured an 
81-78 triple-overtime victory over host Lompoc in a 3-AA semifinal Friday at 
Cabrillo High. 
</P>
<P>
"What you just saw was a great high school basketball game," O'Brien said. "We 
executed well down to the final play. So did they. It was almost like two 
points was a cushion." 
</P>
<P>
With five seconds left in the third overtime, sophomore forward Matt 
Fuerbringer drove the lane for a layup, was fouled and completed the 
three-point play for the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (19-9) will face Servite, a 74-60 winner over Culver City in Friday's 
other semifinal, in the championship game at 8:30 Wednesday night in the Bren 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
But that game will be hard-pressed to match this one for sheer excitement. 
There were 15 lead changes from the fourth quarter on. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unbelievable," O'Brien said. "I would never have believed we would get 
this far with these guys. But we've survived. We found a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's victory was no exception for the undersized, overachieving 
Eagles. Lompoc (21-6) held a 13-point lead late in the second quarter, thanks 
mainly to forward Maurice White's 15 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
But Estancia guard Agustin Heredia brought Estancia back in the second half. He 
hit seven of seven field goal attempts, and his pair of free throws with 19 
seconds left in regulation gave Estancia a 68-65 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Heredia's miss on the front end of a one-and-one with 11 seconds 
left that allowed Lompoc to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Garife buried an off-balance three-pointer with two seconds left to tie 
the score at 68-68. 
</P>
<P>
In the first overtime, Lompoc's Scott Morgan hit a turnaround hook to tie the 
score at 72-72, and Estancia failed to get off a shot as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
With 32 second left in the second overtime, Heredia put in his own missed shot 
to tie the score at 76-76. 
</P>
<P>
In the third overtime, White's looping layup with 59 seconds left tied the 
score at 78-78. Estancia's final play was designed for Heredia, but Fuerbringer 
saw an opening in Lompoc's defense and took it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was waiting for (the lane) to close, but it didn't," Fuerbringer said. "So I 
just put it up and in." 
</P>
<P>
Fuerbringer had nine of his 18 points in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia was the game's leading scorer with 32 points. Mike Haas added 14 and 
Torey Hammond 13 for Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
Lompoc, which upset top-seeded Morningside to reach the semifinal, was led by 
White's 22 points and 12 rebounds. Garife and Marshall Emerson scored 14 each 
for Lompoc, and guard Duane Jeter added 13.

The Ocean View, La Quinta and Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball teams will find 
themselves in unfamiliar positions when the Southern Section playoffs continue 
Saturday night: Each will be making the school's first appearance in the girls' 
playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (26-2) will play Buena (25-0) in a 5-A game at Ventura High School; 
La Quinta (25-3) will meet Palm Desert (25-2) in a 4-A game at College of the 
Desert, and Rancho Alamitos (20-3) will play San Dimas (16-6) at Bolsa Grande 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, the fourth-seeded team in the 5-A division, faces a difficult task 
for several reasons. Buena, the top-seeded team in 5-A, has plenty of playoff 
experience. Last year, the Bulldogs lost in the semifinals. They have been 
semifinalists four times before in the 4-A division, finalists five times, 
champions in 1979 and '84 and state champions in Division I in '83 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs have advanced to the playoffs in each of Coach Joe Vaughan's 16 
years. Vaughan has the best record (351-29) in the state among girls' coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Buena has lost only twice at home in the past 10 years, to Santa Barbara two 
seasons ago and to state champion Brea-Olinda last season. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Ocean View is that although the game is a home game for 
Buena, at least it won't be played in Buena's gym. All semifinal games are at 
alternate sites. The game will be played at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has a definite height advantage with 6-2, 185-pound Jennifer 
Sullivan (17.4 ppg, 14.6 rebounds) and 5-11 Tracy Wolfe (13.3 ppg, 9.5 
rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (18-9) vs Loara (16-10) at Savanna High School -- Loara has come on 
strong in the playoffs, upsetting Mission Viejo in the quarterfinals and 
second-seeded Woodbridge in the second round. Loara is led by 6-1 junior center 
Tracy Titus (16.6 ppg, 10.9 rebounds). Jennifer Leonard, Liz Redman and Kristin 
Thibodeau provided strong support, and senior guard Lisa Nakazono runs the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, like Loara, is unseeded. The Cougars upset third-seeded Westlake in 
the second round before eliminating Edison. They are led by 5-7 junior guard 
Cori Herman (16.45 ppg), an adept three-point shooter, and 5-9 sophomore 
forward Denise Rea (9.5 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A: 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (25-3) vs Palm Desert (25-2) at College of the Desert -- La Quinta 
has dominated the not-so-tough Garden Grove League, winning nine straight 
titles. But in the past, the Aztecs have faltered when they met tougher 
competition in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not so this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are led by Amy Jalewalia (33.4 ppg, 11.8 rebounds), a 6-1 
guard-forward-center who last year led the state in scoring. Heather Brannan, a 
5-11 senior forward, averages 15.0 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Palm Desert starts a good-sized lineup including leading scorers 
Tisa Read (5-10) and Brenda Joyce (5-10) each of whom average about 12 points. 
Senior guard Christie Dammer, whom coach Randy Housken calls the best defensive 
guard in Southern California, will attempt to stop Jalewalia. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (28-0) vs Alemany (20-6) at Esperanza High School -- Top-seeded 
Brea-Olinda has trounced two playoff opponents. The Lady Cats, the defending 
division champions, are led by state player of the year Aimee McDaniel and 
all-state guard Tammy Blackburn. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany, the fourth-seeded team in the division, is led in scoring by 5-2 
sophomore Rachel Corelli (10 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (26-4) vs. Estancia (14-12) at University High School -- Unseeded 
Estancia has come on strong in the playoffs, upsetting third-seeded Lompoc in 
the quarterfinals, thanks to a school-record 42-point performance by junior 
guard Melody Earle. 
</P>
<P>
Patrice Lumpkin, a 5-10 forward, averages 12.6 points a game. Forward Monique 
Sweet also provides some solid play. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes has won the Bay League title and reached the playoffs the past 
three seasons, advancing to the 4-A semifinals last year. The Sea Kings have a 
definite height advantage with three starters at least 6 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Humphreys, a 5-10 senior forward leads the Sea Kings in scoring with 15.2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A: 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas (16-6) vs Rancho Alamitos (20-3) at Bolsa Grande High School -- 
Rancho Alamitos, the top-seeded team in the division, is led by Jenny Newsome, 
a 5-9 senior who averages 24 points and 12 rebounds a game. San Dimas relies 
heavily on inside scoring, which should contrast strongly with the Vaqueros 
up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Kramer, a 5-11 senior center, and Shelly Baughn a 5-11 junior post 
player each average 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
South Hills (19-5) vs. Costa Mesa (15-11) at Estancia High School -- Costa Mesa 
is undoubtedly the Cinderella team of the division. The unseeded Mustangs were 
third in the Pacific Coast League, but they are in the semifinals after 
upsetting third-seeded Bellflower convincingly and defeating Notre Dame of 
Sherman Oaks in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are led by Orange County's best freshman -- Olivia DiCamilli. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli (5-10) averages 14.8 points and 11.8 rebounds but she's scoring more 
points in the playoffs. Junior forward Rachel Ward averages 10.8 points and 
senior guard Thuy Nguyen, a three-point threat, averages 11.1 points. Senior 
Michele Bryant runs the point and junior Robin Nichols is the fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded South Hills defeated at-large Yucca Valley by 14 points in the 
second round, then edged Cabrillo, another at-large team, by six points in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley (20-3) vs Santa Margarita (20-6) at Saddleback College at 7 
p.m. -- Santa Margarita, the fourth-seeded team in the division, meets its 
stiffest competition in top-seeded Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are led by sophomore Kristen Mulligan, the only Santa Margarita 
player who averages in double figures (22.1 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley has plenty of height. Amy Kisling (5-11) leads Santa Ynez 
Valley with 14.2 points a game, followed by 5-11 Amy Gillingham (11.2 ppg) and 
5-2 Jenifer DeMatteo (11 ppg).

SLAYBACK'S 2 GOALS LEAD LAGUNA HILLS PAST BELL GARDENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Slayback scored two goals to lead Laguna Hills High School to a 4-0 
victory over Bell Gardens Friday in a Southern Section 2-A quarterfinal match 
at Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Slayback tied the Laguna Hills' single-season record of 23 set by Brian Fleming 
(1986-87). 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kannenberg and Scott Clark also scored. Chad Davidson had eight saves for 
his seventh shutout for Laguna Hills (22-5). 
</P>
<P>
In another 2-A boys' match: 
</P>
<P>
Orange 5, Montebello 1 -- Montebello (19-2-4) led, 1-0, when Jose Juarez scored 
10 minutes into the match. But Tim Huhn scored 15 minutes later and Ricky 
Heimer scored three goals in the second half as host Orange (18-0-4) pulled 
away. Juan Viveros also scored for Orange, the top seed in 2-A. . It was the 
third time that Heimer has scored three goals in a match this season. Orange's 
Tres Martin had five saves 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A Division: 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 1, Mater Dei 0 (OT) -- Tom Hamlin scored two minutes into the 
second 10-minute overtime to give the hosts the victory. Simi Valley improved 
its record to 27-1, while Mater Dei finished at 16-7-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the Small Schools Division: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran 1, Temecula Valley 0 -- Jason Haynes scored five minutes into 
the match to lead host Orange Lutheran (16-2-2). Dave Hopper had six saves for 
Orange Lutheran and Chris Snodgrass had 14 saves for Temecula Valley.

THREE-POINTER FAILS, CHAPMAN FALLS

<P>
For the time it took a basketball to travel about 40 feet, Kevin Stafford 
looked like a Chapman College hero Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford was sure his three-point attempt with a second remaining was going in 
and the game with UC Riverside was going into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that was going in," Stafford said. "When I let it go, I just felt it 
was going." 
</P>
<P>
But the shot hit the back of the rim and UC Riverside held on to win, 67-64, a 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. game in front of a 1,600-fan homecoming 
crowd at the Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Riverside (19-7 and 9-4 in the CCAA) remained alone in second 
place. Chapman, already eliminated from the four-team postseason tournament, 
dropped to 11-15 and 3-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers, who trailed by 15 at halftime, put together a strong rally in the 
second half and came as close as two missed three-point shots in the final six 
seconds of sending the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside's Mike Ritter, the conference's second-leading free-throw shooter at 
85% entering the game, missed two front ends of one-and-ones in the final 30 
seconds. The first miss set up a three-point basket by Chris Martin to cut 
Riverside's lead to three; the second set up Stafford's near miss. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman made two runs at the Highlanders. Rog Middleton, who scored 31 in his 
conference high of the season, scored three consecutive baskets and Martin made 
a three-point shot to cut the lead to three, 53-50, with 10 minutes, 23 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But Riverside quickly upped its lead to eight when Kevin Krause put in a 
rebound and Ritter made a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside led by six with 1:15 remaining when Chapman made its final run. 
Middleton made two free throws, Andre Hill made a steal and a layup and Martin 
hit a three-pointer after Ritter missed a free throw. Leading by one with 14 
seconds remaining, Reggie Howard made two free throws to give Riverside the 
final three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside took a 37-22 lead at the half on the strength of its three-point 
shooting. The Highlanders made five of eight three-point attempts in the first 
half and made 10 of 23 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Ceballos, who opened the game with a three-pointer, scored 13 points to 
lead the Highlanders at the half. He and Howard each finished with 16 points to 
lead Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Reyes added 11 points and 14 rebounds for Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chapman guard Von Shuler was suspended from the team for the final two games 
"due to an attitude problem unacceptable to the basketball staff."

NRBQ IS SERIOUS ABOUT HAVING FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The English language gives most musicians credit for something they don't 
really do: No matter what happens on a stage or in a studio, the operative verb 
for music-making is "play." 
</P>
<P>
NRBQ truly played Thursday night at the Coach House. The venerable bar-rockers 
from the Northeast played the way kids play -- with delighted absorption in the 
sheer fun of fooling around. 
</P>
<P>
This is a band that has its priorities straight when it comes to play. In 
Webster's New World Dictionary, the typical musical definitions of play rank 
only sixth and seventh on the list of the word's possible meanings. NRBQ paid 
heed to meanings 1 and 2: "To move lightly, rapidly, or erratically; flutter" 
and "to amuse oneself, as by taking part in a game or sport." 
</P>
<P>
While most bands are satisfied with playing a given style of music, NRBQ got 
its kicks by playing with styles, the way kids play with Legos or Lincoln Logs. 
A kid at play might figure, why just build your basic log cabin? Why not put a 
skyscraper tower on it, or maybe a dome? Now wouldn't that be neat? In the same 
way, NRBQ threw out pop music's zoning laws and architectural codes, just for 
the fun of building something neat. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Adams, NRBQ's keyboards player, would fashion your basic, time-honored 
barrelhouse piano run and start dabbling around with the blueprints. How about 
wiring that solid old edifice of standard boogie with some far-out, chromatic 
free-jazz space music? Bet nobody's ever tried that before, huh? Bet nobody 
else would even dare. One thing is certain: With his hyperactively weird stage 
comportment and his ever-shifting looks of mischievous wonderment and 
spaced-out befuddlement, Adams was the strangest, most watchable rock 'n' roll 
piano player this side of Jerry Lee Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
A similarly playful attitude inspired guitarist Al Anderson to repeatedly take 
his beloved rockabilly runs on wide detours. Notes were bent and twisted and 
skittered together in ways that Carl Perkins never imagined. After one country 
guitar solo that he executed in the traditional, old-fashioned and sensible 
way, full of bassy twang, Anderson came right back with a solo in which he took 
bassy twang to sublimely ridiculous extremes. He fooled around with his 
Telecaster's tuning keys until the notes got so low and growly that they 
sounded like a grizzly bear waking up grumpy (come to think of it, with his 
considerable height and girth and his comical squint and scowl, that's what Big 
Al kind of resembles). 
</P>
<P>
NRBQ used these toying techniques to play music ranging from the fine, catchy 
pop of its fetching recent album, "Wild Weekend," to country howlers like 
George Jones' "White Lightning." Several winsome ballads and a sweetly odd, 
description-defying version of "Whistle While You Work" were thrown in for good 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
NRBQ resembles the Band in its ability to take roots-rock styles and sound both 
authentic and fresh, rather than simply imitative. Like the Band, NRBQ's lineup 
has been together so long, played so many roadhouses and developed such strong 
skills that it has gone beyond tightness -- the grail of most groups -- to an 
utter ease and looseness. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, with Adams and Anderson veering hither and thither around the solid 
center provided by drummer Tom Ardolino and bassist Joey Spampinato, NRBQ was 
loose to the point of sloppiness. A murky sound mix added to the extremely 
off-the-cuff feel of the performance. If NRBQ were to release a recording of 
this show, they would have to call the album "The Sub-Basement Tapes." 
</P>
<P>
But this basement was a funhouse from wall to wall, full of surprising 
attractions. In a world that is far too tight, long may NRBQ unwind.

FANS HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE NEW ACT. IT ISN'T ALWAYS PRETTY, BUT IT CONNECTS.

Roseanne Barr is one of the great improbables of late 20th-Century American 
culture, a figure who might have leaped out of the "Donahue" show into American 
pop consciousness with the provocative theme "When Bad Artists Do Good Things." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the crowd of 3,700 who caught Barr's new act here at the Circle Star 
Theater on Thursday may not have known that before she was America's No. 1 
sitcom mom, she was a stand-up comedian who catapulted out of the clubs into 
prime time, where by necessity she cleaned up her act without altering its 
essential appeal to those numberless women who have to fight out their 
existence amid squabbling kids, weary if not loutish husbands, meager incomes 
or an ongoing holocaust of advertisements designed to belittle their lack of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Barr is using her three-night stand to break in some new material and to 
introduce her new husband, comedian Tom Arnold. The theater -- located on the 
San Mateo peninsula about 15 miles south of San Francisco -- is a fairly 
popular stop for mainstream artists on national tours. B.B. King is playing 
next week with Bobby Bland; Diana Ross, the Beach Boys and Glenn Yarbrough and 
the Limelighters are upcoming acts. 
</P>
<P>
Barr's audience says as much about her as does her choice of material, or how 
she delivers it. Slightly more than half were women, as you'd expect. Many of 
them overweight, with upswept hairdos, spit curls, and wearing sequined 
pullover tops, their concession to formality. Strictly working class. The men, 
too, were blue-collar types, brave and willing, but somewhat ill at ease and a 
watchful reflexive step behind their girlfriends' or wives' impulses. They all 
cheered Roseanne's entrance with a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly she's become an icon. 
</P>
<P>
The first and briefest part of her act consisted of what she termed her "golden 
oldies," material she'd worked up over the relatively few years she spent in 
the clubs. For imagery, conciseness, language and rhythm, it was the best part 
of her program -- material she'd polished to durability in the raucous, smoky 
trenches of club life (on her husband's perpetually asking her to find things 
misplaced: "Like they think the uterus is a tracking device"). 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the program consisted in a solo turn by Arnold, a congenial, 
beefy young man with neck-length hair, whose most notable feature in the course 
of the evening was an eagerness to please his new wife by popping on stage with 
a bouquet of roses and a plate of chicken wings. Otherwise, he's a very 
ordinary and somewhat uncertain comedian. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a body builder," he told us. "These are the same pants I had in high 
school, only 8 inches lower," and "See what I look like? If a guy looks better 
than me, he's gay." 
</P>
<P>
Arnold had the wisdom to get off as soon as Roseanne was ready with the second 
part of her act, in which she played "Rosie With a Z," a showbiz parody of the 
calculated celebrity comeback, wearing a truly gaudy outfit: a full length 
splotchy black-and-white coat, a mustard-colored pullover with sequined chest 
design, leopard skin pants and boots. She also sings some standard showbiz 
champion songs, such as "I Am Woman" and "People," execrably off key and 
sometimes screechily, to the mock sanctimonious accompaniment of pianist Steve 
Moore. In an oddly masochistic exchange, she asked him what he did for 
Christmas, and he replied by calling her indifferent, fat and tone deaf. 
</P>
<P>
In this, and a following stand-up segment in which she returns to describe 
herself in the multiple personalities of a woman in the course of a menstrual 
month, she was probing but unfocused. Once she steps beyond domestic issues and 
the topic of having to deal with men, her observations aren't very sharp 
(though unlike Arsenio Hall, for example, she's refreshingly free of the 
showbiz commandment that thou shalt not speak ill of another celebrity). When 
she says "I still believe what the world desperately needs is love sweet love," 
you can't quite make out whether she's reaching for a message or parodying 
celebrity sanctimoniousness -- or waiting to take credit for whatever side the 
audience decides to set down its approbation. 
</P>
<P>
Her finale, in which she sings -- badly of course -- "My Way" with an Elvis 
impersonator named Michael Cooper, suggests that the whole thing is a sendup, 
which may in the end be a self-defense, the way sarcasm is a preemptive defense 
against ridicule. There's a strong element of self-hate in Roseanne's act that 
runs parallel to her stalwart feminist assertions and their rebellious 
vulgarity and tastelessness (a number of people walked out of her show). That 
may be one of the reasons she distances her audience in her references to it as 
"white nerds" and "Joe-nobodies." This was a crowd that was part Nathanael West 
and part John Waters, the kind of lonely crowd that looks to evangelists to 
alleviate the darkness that surrounds it. 
</P>
<P>
Roseanne Barr is not an artistically accomplished show-biz pro, not even as a 
mock amateur ironist, the way Martin Mull is. In all the reports we hear of her 
tantrums and her attempts to shape a public image, we can feel her distress 
under the awesome pressure celebrity confers on the unwary. Too, she may sense 
the appalling hunger she touches in an audience that responds to her the way it 
responds to no one else. Her act seems an acknowledgement and an attempt at 
intimacy, and a warning not to get too close.

A ONE-SIDED 'PROMETHEUS' RANTS AT HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
When Keith Antar Mason chose the infamous "wilding" incident that occured last 
year in New York's Central Park as the basis for a performance piece, he must 
have realized what he was up against. 
</P>
<P>
How could anyone of any race summon up a shred of sympathy for the pack of 
black youths accused of raping and nearly beating to death a white woman 
jogger? 
</P>
<P>
And yet "Prometheus on a Black Landscape: The Core," which opened Thursday at 
Highways in Santa Monica, is full of whining and ranting about the history of 
black oppression and the frantic needs of the black libido -- carryings on 
that, at the very least, make a mockery of black men who have not found it 
necessary or amusing to deprive others of their liberty. 
</P>
<P>
The attack itself is suitably horrific, with the five insolent, swaggering 
Ashanti Bloods closing in on the jogger (Erika Schickel), "beating" her and 
carrying her away as she screams in all-too-real terror and pain. 
</P>
<P>
But she remains a kind of cartoon figure, reappearing later to sob and droop in 
her downstage corner, comforted by her "spiritual" counterpart, Raina Paris, a 
shriekingly protective good-fairy figure in a blue tulle skirt. We never get to 
know her as a person, and the sole reference to her investment banking career 
-- "Tomorrow I was gonna make a kill" -- is shrilly stereotyped. 
</P>
<P>
As the woodenly paced, two-hour piece lumbers along, the Bloods sometimes hang 
out in front of the stage, staring down members of the audience, or laughing in 
a witless, evil way at occurences on stage. They get to do most of the moving 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Garbed in woolly loincloths, they crumble into doubled-over postures to 
illustrate how they are "the broken people," Outfitted in color-dappled 
jumpsuits, they form a genial chorus line. In slacks and shirts, they prowl 
with scuffing, sliding movements of their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Crank (Daryl A. Swann), one of the alleged attackers in this version, 
languishes in jail, where he is visited by various folk from his past and 
future. They include his impotently God-fearing father, a chic black woman 
(Alretha Rakel) who falls in love with him, urges him to greater things and 
ultimately gives him up, and Omo/Exu (Lynell Gardner), a wiry, hyperactive 
doomsayer whose body is painted with white letters. 
</P>
<P>
Wafting through the piece for no observable rhyme or reason are figures from 
Greek mythology and Western history. A black Medusa (Meri Danquah) does a 
perfunctory, pelvic-thrusting dance; another Medusa (poet Wanda Coleman) 
recites on a videotape. A white Perseus (Bruce Sanborn) is embarrassed about 
the size of his sexual organ and stabs himself in the foot with his cardboard 
sword. Crank's free-form trial at the end offers the opportunity for cameo 
testimony by Joan of Arc (Curtis York cutting a sweet, serpentine figure), an 
impossibly affected Virginia Woolf (Roxanne Beckford), John F. Kennedy and 
Angela Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Other personages are apparently Mason's own creations: KaKro (Brian Foster), an 
orotund, justice-meting vulture in a pearl collar and feathers and Drumrock 
(Keith Coleman), a leering, prancing, purple-headdressed spinoff of the 
Egyptian god Anubis. 
</P>
<P>
But the meeting of camp and rage in the piece not only evades the central issue 
of responsibility for crime; it also makes for bad theater in which too much is 
regurgitated and too little is experienced afresh. 
</P>
<P>
"Prometheus" will be repeated tonight and March 1-4.

MOTHERS' PEACE MOVEMENT FOCUS OF 'WOMEN IN WAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sincere idealism runs through the two-part report, "Women in War" (Sunday and 
March 4, 8 p.m, on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable channel) -- an idealism 
that tends to project both a sense of hope and an air of simplifying complex 
issues. Host Pat Mitchell, of the "Today" show's "Woman to Woman" segment, 
voices the idealism, but without the verve and color that a Linda Ellerbee 
might bring to the story. 
</P>
<P>
The first "Women in War" program on Sunday covers the turmoils in Northern 
Ireland and Israel's West Bank and Gaza Strip; the concluding segment travels 
to El Salvador and gang-ravaged streets in the United States. This 
juxtaposition places our domestic strife within a broader context of war, while 
making the efforts of inner-city mothers to organize and change their 
neighborhoods heroic and universal. 
</P>
<P>
That mothers' basic concerns are the same across the globe is surely true; as 
leading Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan Mikhail-Ashrawi states (and as her 
Israeli women allies agree), women have a deep stake in preserving life and 
halting war. It is just as doubtless, though, that the intifada, the Northern 
Irish "troubles," the Salvadoran civil war and the inner-city battles derive 
from horribly complicated circumstances with economic, religious and cultural 
sources. Mitchell is mindful of this but, in the end, seems assured that women 
can band together against the odds. 
</P>
<P>
Her own report raises doubts about such optimism. Dozens of activist Salvadoran 
women have lost their lives demonstrating peacefully. Northern Ireland's 
non-violent, mothers-led movement, Peace People, went from Nobel Prize-winning 
fame in the mid '70s to virtual dissolution in a few short years. Strife 
between Palestinians and Israelis has only accelerated, as it has in America's 
ghettos and barrios. 
</P>
<P>
"Women in War" contains many portraits of women who have found power within 
themselves in disempowering conditions. Perhaps they are the only hope; one 
only wonders if they are enough. ROBERT KOEHLER

'LEGACY' UNITES CHILDREN OF CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spirit of elation -- that seems to be the best word -- flows through a 
two-hour special Sunday (8 p.m., KCAL Channel 9) that tries to lay witness to 
the next steps in the march toward civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
"Legacy of a Movement" is edited from a discussion among a panel of children of 
"the Movement" during the National Youth Summit Conference sponsored last 
October in Washington, D.C., by the Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
Writer-producer-host Larry Carroll also intercuts interview bites from veterans 
of the struggle. One woman sounded a keynote: "One day we knew we would sit at 
a lunch counter . . . (and ride) in the front of the bus. . . . Now that it's 
here, I think (that) some parts of us have stopped dreaming. It's as if they 
have reached the Promised Land." Not yet, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel -- "shareholders in the harvest" -- includes Martin Luther King III, 
Atallah Shabazz (daughter of Malcolm X), Jesse Jackson Jr., Thurgood Marshall 
Jr., Pam Gregory (daughter of Dick Gregory), and Mpho Tutu (daughter of South 
African Bishop Desmond Tutu). You'll seldom see young people with a more 
ferocious sense of commitment. "If you walk like a victim, you can't walk," 
Shabazz says. "We cannot 'march' slums away," says Jackson Jr. "We cannot 'sit 
in' the slums away. We cannot 'protest' the slums away. We have to 'finance' 
the slums away." 
</P>
<P>
They rage about political imbalance, dreams thwarted by the drug culture, the 
absolute need for cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of rambling rhetoric but it's largely articulate and wily, 
often witty, testifying that this next generation will be powered by its own 
eloquence. They'll make all of America proud. 
</P>
<P>
The ironies, of course, don't go away. "Thirty years ago," one of them notes, 
"we could not have met in this hotel." IRV LETOFSKY

'FAMILY FOR JOE' PUTS UNLIKELY TWIST ON MARY POPPINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Mitchum boggles the mind as a crusty, grizzled sort of Mary Poppins in 
the TV movie "A Family for Joe" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39), 
the pilot for a series that NBC will show later this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchum takes on the nanny role in this unlikely story about four upscale 
orphans who hire a derelict to live with them as their grandfather, so they 
won't have to go to foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
Joe (Mitchum), unshaven and dirty, former resident of a cardboard box, moves 
into the orphans' comfortable suburban house and, surprise, he cleans up 
nicely. Underneath the grime is a strong, ex-merchant marine (and ex-alcoholic, 
reassuringly sober for years), who settles down with only token protest to take 
his grandfathering seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Watching requires blanket disbelief and a high tolerance for heartstring 
tugging: Will 6-year-old Mary, silent since her parents' death, ever speak 
again? Will teen-age Nick decide drugs are wrong? Will Christopher's accident 
keep Joe from leaving? Will they all become a real family at last? 
</P>
<P>
Writer Arnold Margolin and director Jeffrey Melman telegraph the answers in 
traditional small-screen style. It's Mitchum's laconic, larger-than-life 
presence that doesn't quite fit their formula. Known for his supermacho movie 
roles, he looks as if he'd wandered onto the wrong sound stage and decided to 
hang around for kicks. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers may find it worth hanging around just to see him loll in a bubble bath 
chewing a big, ugly cigar or to hear him object to a skeptical social worker 
(Barbara Babcock) as "some highfalutin broad" and inform the bereft orphans, "I 
ain't Santa Claus." LYNNE HEFFLEY

DAY HIKE: EXPLORE A CANYON OF RUGGED, RUSTIC BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rustic Canyon is every bit as woodsy and secluded as its name suggests. The 
surprisingly rugged little enclave is located in the Pacific Palisades section 
of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
To the concern of conservationists, the greater part of Rustic Canyon is owned 
by the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. That means -- you guessed it -- 
the canyon could become the site of Rustic Sanitary Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
More dump sites are needed, says the county. 
</P>
<P>
Don't fill beautiful canyons like Rustic with garbage, say conservationists. 
</P>
<P>
But Rustic Canyon and neighboring mountain canyons have a lot of friends and 
supporters. Because a proposed garbage dump can be the hottest of political 
issues, the canyons are far from doomed. As you ramble through Rustic Canyon, 
you might contemplate the words of Aldous Huxley: "In the course of human 
evolution, man is supposed to have sacrificed the greater part of his olfactory 
center to his cortex, his sense of smell to his intelligence. Nevertheless, it 
remains a fact that in politics, no less than in love and social relations, 
smell judgments continue to play a major role." 
</P>
<P>
For the hiker, Rustic Canyon and neighboring Sullivan Canyon provide an 
interesting contrast. Sullivan is a gently sloping canyon with a wide flat 
floor shaded by sycamores. Rustic is wild, narrow, steep, with dramatic rock 
walls. One way to reach Rustic Canyon is to descend via Sullivan Canyon; 
another way (this day hike) is via Will Rogers Park. 
</P>
<P>
Rustic Canyon has a storied past. A hundred years ago, the Santa Monica 
Forestry Station was established next to the canyon. The many eucalyptus trees 
in and around the canyon are a result of the efforts of tobacco millionaire 
Abbot Kinney, developer of Venice and forestry pioneer. The eucalyptus, an 
Australian import, thrived in Southern California but, to Kinney's 
disappointment, proved to be a miserable source of timber. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Rustic Canyon remained undeveloped until the early 1920s, when it 
became the woodsy retreat of a group of Los Angeles businessmen know as The 
Uplifters. 
</P>
<P>
The group, at first an offshoot of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, was chartered 
to "uplift art, promote good fellowship and build a closer acquaintance among 
its members." 
</P>
<P>
L. Frank Baum, author of the "Wizard of Oz" books, came up with the name "The 
Lofty and Excellent Order of the Uplifters." Cabins, clubhouse buildings and an 
outdoor theater were built in the canyon. The club was strong during the 1920s, 
slowed during the Depression years, and came to an end after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
This day hike begins in Will Rogers State Historic Park. You'll follow the 
trail to Inspiration Point, march a mile or two up the Backbone Trail, then 
descend into Rustic Canyon and loop back to Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
One highlight of Rustic Canyon is Rustic Creek. Most streams in the Santa 
Monica Mountains flow only after rains, but Rustic Creek is one of the few that 
is spring-fed and thus usually flows all year round. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile of the trail through Rustic Canyon is right next to, and even in, 
Rustic Creek. It's wet going, it's poor trail and not for beginning hikers. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades, turn north 
on the access road leading to Will Rogers State Historic Park. There is a state 
park day use fee of $3. Park near the polo field or Rogers' house. A tour of 
the cowboy philosopher's home is well worth your time. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: From Will Rogers home, on the east side of a wide field, take the 
paved road leading past a line of eucalyptus trees to a riding ring. Soon 
you'll intersect a dirt road. Turn left on this road (actually, right is OK too 
because the roads join). If you head left, be sure to stay on the main fire 
road and ignore rightward turns on lesser roads. 
</P>
<P>
The fire road ascends to a place just below Inspiration Point, where you'll 
spot an information kiosk. Continue to Inspiration Point for inspiring 
clear-day views of the city if you wish, but our hike joins a trail to the left 
of the information kiosk (which used to have information and a nice map, but is 
usually empty these days). 
</P>
<P>
Climbing Chicken Ridge, the trail offers great views of downtown, Century City, 
the sweep of Santa Monica Bay and Catalina Island. The trail you're following 
is the beginning of the Backbone Trial, a 65-mile path that when completed will 
travel the spine of the Santa Monica Mountains from Will Rogers Park to Point. 
Mugu State Park. 
</P>
<P>
After a mile's climb along the ridge, the trail crests, then descends another 
quarter-mile to an unsigned three-way junction. The two leftward trails are 
high- and low-route continuations of the Backbone, but you'll turn sharply to 
the right and begin a steep descent on a connector trail. This manzanita-lined 
trail wastes no time descending half a mile over a slippery slope to the bottom 
of Rustic Canyon. Ahead is a white barn and an unsigned intersection with 
Rustic Canyon Trail. Left up Rustic Canyon leads to Camp Josepho, a Boy Scout 
camp. You bear right, down-canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Rustic Canyon Trail stays at the canyon bottom, crossing and re-crossing the 
creek. You'll pass the ruins of homes that have suffered the ravages of fire 
and flood. Rustic Canyon flora includes the usual riparian growth plus some 
stray exotics such as cactus, aloe, jade and periwinkle. German ivy, a pretty 
but invasive plant with little yellow flowers, has really taken over in some 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pass a small dam. The trail narrows, the canyon walls close in. A trail 
sign tells you it's 0.3 mile back to Will Rogers Park. You'll follow an 
elaborate trail, fashioned with enough wooden trestles to support a freight 
train, then cross a white bridge over a culvert and spy the parking lot and 
Rogers' house, where this hike began. 
</P>

HANDCRAFTS, MACHINE AGE MEET AT MARYLAND PLANT

Furniture designer and craftsman Peter Danko fits snugly into that space where 
handcrafts meet high tech, where the ancient harmonies of nature intersect with 
the streamlined ethos of the machine age, where industry and cottage industry 
find common ground. It's not a well-populated space, to be sure, but it offers 
a multitude of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Danko's studio, in a block of warehouses in this suburb of Baltimore, is 
emblematic of his crossroads position. It's a big, unadorned, garage-like 
space, with busy artisans at their machines in one warehouse, stacks of chairs 
and chair parts in another. As commercial as they come, in other words. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there's a feeling of not factory but family warmth here. Peter Danko and 
Associates is indeed a family affair; Elizabeth Danko runs the business end of 
the company she owns with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
The firm produces several lines of furniture, including love seats, dining 
tables and occasional tables, but is best known for its chairs, which range 
from versatile stackables to upholstered handmade cherry rockers. These can be 
found in restaurants (including the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center and the 
new Wright Place in the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space 
Museum), libraries, corporate board rooms and the Museum of Modern Art -- as 
well as in private homes. 
</P>

Danko furniture, which is sold mostly through architects and interior 
designers, has echoes of art nouveau in its sinuous organic shapes. Its spare, 
unfussy lines recall the Bauhaus "form follows function" dictum. In short, it 
is a synthesis of classic and contemporary stylings, clean-lined and simple 
enough to please modern purists, but flowing and curvilinear enough for 
romantics. 
</P>
<P>
Although their handsome lines and wood construction might indicate otherwise, 
nearly all of Danko products are mass-produced. And with his most famous 
invention, the Bodyform chair, Danko expanded into advanced technology: These 
chairs are produced not by the hand of man but by a complex system of 
computerized robotics. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband's career has, Elizabeth Danko says, progressed in a very different 
manner from that of many artisans. Whereas they might turn out simple 
production pieces until they can afford to do the one-of-a-kind work they love, 
he actually prefers the challenges of mass production to the prestige of custom 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"For every piece he makes, he'll do up to 20 prototypes," she says. "All are 
hand-built, and each one is a little bit different. To him, that's the 
challenge: to take a design and perfect it, so that it's beautiful and well 
designed and easy to manufacture, as well. He would rather do that than just be 
a craftsman, and have each piece be different." 
</P>
<P>
Danko says: "If you're going to do something that's artistic, it's nice to be 
able to do it more than once. I guess it comes down to this: I spend so much 
time getting something perfect that I could never do one of a kind. The last 
chair I designed took 2 1/2 years." 
</P>
<P>
When Danko entered the furniture business, he saw himself more as a sculptor 
than a cabinetmaker, in the tradition of 17th- and 18th-Century craftsmen whose 
work involved much carving and ornamentation. 
</P>
<P>
His early '70s style was distinctive. He would take large blocks, made of 
layers of laminated wood veneers, and carve them in his own curvaceous style. 
His portfolio shows a variety of his work from this period: a desk that is 
supported on voluptuous, almost human legs; a sofa made of snakelike wooden 
tendrils supporting bulbous leather cushions, a lamp that's a Paul Klee 
squiggle. 
</P>
<P>
"These are all antiques now," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
One particular inspiration was the bentwood technique developed by 19th-Century 
designer and manufacturer Michael Thonet. Danko improved on the Thonet 
principles by developing his own molds that take sandwiched layers of veneer 
and shape them under pressure into chair forms. Any number of pieces can be 
made from a single successful mold. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of time goes into the mold," he says. "Before you make your production 
mold you make your prototype molds, and keep throwing them away until you get 
it exactly right." 
</P>
<P>
The Bodyform chair, designed in 1976 and first manufactured two years later, 
has taken Danko's process to its high-tech extreme. The chairs are made from a 
single sheet of plywood, cunningly cut and molded for strength and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
"The neat thing about this chair also is that it's now made totally by a 
computerized machine station," Danko says. "I guess robot would be the word 
you'd use. 
</P>
<P>
"After it's molded, it has all this glue oozing out, and the layers are uneven, 
so the layers have to be machined. So they have this computerized machine that 
does all the edges and levels the chair. It machines the hand-hold in the back, 
and if the chair will be upholstered, it drills the holes for the seat. Since 
this is the only chair made out of one piece of wood, it's the only chair where 
you can do all these operations at once." 
</P>
<P>
The factory, Sauder Manufacturing in Stryker, Ohio, makes the Bodyform chairs. 
</P>
<P>
While Sauder is responsible for most of the mass-produced Danko furniture, the 
workshop in Clinton, where Danko moved three years ago, handles smaller orders. 
They make the parts for the new Waveform chair and the Lazy Spiral, an Art 
Deco-influenced adjustable chair "named for our favorite neighboring galaxy." 
</P>
<P>
"It's still very much a craft shop," Danko says. "That's kind of where I like 
it. If I was really big, I wouldn't be able to play in my shop any more, and if 
I was really small, I'd be working all the time just to pay for my shop. 
There's a happy area in between, and I'm pretty close to being where I want to 
be."

BOB GREENE: MY ONE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout history, it has been said that if a man accomplishes only one great 
thing during his time on Earth, then his life has been worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good thought. Some men have become inspiring political leaders and have 
helped bring peace to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some men have become religious leaders and have brought a sense of spirituality 
and reverence to the world. 
</P>
<P>
Some men have become brave generals and have led the forces of goodness to 
victory over the forces of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
And now, at last, I have accomplished the one great thing that justifies my 
presence on the planet -- the one great thing I will always be remembered for. 
</P>
<P>
I am the guy who is responsible for getting the comma out of the title of 
"Louie Louie." 
</P>
<P>
This monumental achievement actually took place about a year and a half ago, 
but it became official in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
What happened was that last week I received a long-distance telephone call from 
John Rockwell, a music critic for the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation did not get off to the best of starts. Here is a transcript: 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell: "Hello, this is John Rockwell of the New York Times." 
</P>
<P>
Me: "I hate you." 
</P>
<P>
There was a brief silence on the other end. I explained to Rockwell that in 
1974 he had given a bad review to a book I had written. 
</P>
<P>
"I did?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you did," I said. "Not that I would be small enough to remember such a 
thing 16 years later." 
</P>
<P>
"Are you sure I did?" Rockwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you like me to quote the bad things that you said about my book?" I 
said. "I somehow seem to have this remarkable ability to remember every word." 
</P>
<P>
We laughed heartily. Well, we laughed. Then Rockwell. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I think I'm going to refer to him as "Mr. Rockwell" from this point 
on. That's New York Times style -- "Mr." I've always wanted to use it. "Mr." 
That looks nice in a newspaper. "Mr." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, then Mr. Rockwell told me he was getting ready to write an analysis of 
the song "Louie Louie," and that he needed to locate the column I had written 
about the song. 
</P>
<P>
"Louie Louie" was the 1963 record by the Kingsmen that -- in the words of Mr. 
Rockwell -- "lives on as America's primordial party anthem, the quintessential 
signature tune of rock as good-natured sloppy excess." The success of the 
Kingsmen's version of "Louie Louie" is widely attributed to the fact that many 
young people, when the record was first released, thought the Kingsmen's 
muffled lyrics were dirty. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the dignified spirit of finding out if this was true -- if "Louie 
Louie" was really a dirty song -- that in 1988, in the service of a magazine I 
was writing a column for at the time, I tracked down one Richard Berry. Richard 
Berry was not one of the Kingsmen; he was a rhythm-and-blues singer who wrote 
"Louie Louie" in 1955 and sold away the rights to it soon after. Berry told me 
that, no, the lyrics to "Louie Louie" were never dirty. He sang me the song to 
prove it. 
</P>
<P>
That is not why Mr. Rockwell was calling, however. Mr. Rockwell was calling 
because he remembered that the question of whether there was a comma between 
"Louie" and "Louie" had been addressed in the column. 
</P>
<P>
I had told Berry that the fact-checkers at the magazine I wrote for were going 
to drive him crazy unless Berry could tell me whether it was "Louie, Louie" or 
"Louie Louie." Berry said he had no idea -- he had written the lyrics to "Louie 
Louie" on a piece of toilet paper in a nightclub dressing room. "That piece of 
toilet paper that I wrote 'Louie Louie' on fell apart many years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
I insisted it was important to determine whether there was a comma in the 
title. I told Berry he was going to have to make a decision. "OK," he said, as 
much to get rid of me as anything else. "'Louie Louie.' No comma." 
</P>
<P>
And here was Mr. Rockwell inquiring about the correct style of "Louie Louie" -- 
and soon after, in a New York Times headline, there was the song title: "Louie 
Louie," no comma, now as much a part of Times style as the courtesy term "Mr." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Rockwell's story about "Louie Louie" was quite formal; he actually compared 
the song to the works of Beethoven. Referring to the lasting power of both 
Beethoven and "Louie Louie," Mr. Rockwell wrote: "The success of a masterpiece 
derives partly from its inherent worth, but also partly from the more 
unpredictable, volatile interaction of the work, its public and the Zeitgeist." 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't know about that. But I do know what Berry told me about the song: 
</P>
<P>
"I never could understand the popularity of it. It was a song with three stupid 
guitar-chord changes in it."

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: CHECK PEDIGREES OF THE FAMOUS AND INFAMOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRA V. GORMLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may be related to someone rich and/or famous -- or even an historical 
character who's infamous. Most of us are curious about the possibility of being 
related to some well-known person, or finding an ancestor whose brave deeds are 
recorded in history. 
</P>
<P>
To learn about such connections requires research of your own families, plus 
the genealogies of the famous or infamous. 
</P>
<P>
The pedigrees of American presidents, for example, can be examined by checking 
"Burke's Presidential Families of the United States," a book found in the 
reference section of many libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The more recent "Ancestors of American Presidents" by Gary Boyd Roberts is 
available in many libraries' genealogy collections. 
</P>
<P>
To prove (or disprove, as is often the case) family traditions of being related 
to someone famous or infamous, start by tracing your own family, then go to the 
local library and read everything you can find on the well-known person. Most 
of this information will be found in biographies and in histories of counties 
and states, in old newspaper accounts or in military histories. 
</P>
<P>
Compile the information about the well-known person and put it onto pedigree 
charts and family group sheets. You need to know when and where he or she was 
born, lived, married and died. Biographies will include some of this 
information, but research in such records as censuses, probates, deeds, 
marriages and military records will be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
If family tradition claims a connection to Jesse James, for example, as many 
Midwestern families' histories do, start your research about Jesse James in an 
encyclopedia, which will tell you he was born near Kearney (then Centerville) 
in Clay County, Mo., on Sept. 5, 1847, and died in St. Joseph, Mo., on April 3, 
1882, and that his family was originally from Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
From this meager information, you can start your research in the 1850 Clay 
County, Mo., census by looking for a 3-year-old Jesse and his brother, Frank 
(born 1843). 
</P>
<P>
That census should give you the names of their parents, their ages and where 
they were born. 
</P>
<P>
Then by checking in a county history of Clay County, you may learn more about 
Jesse and Frank's parents and their exact Kentucky origins. Research in land, 
probate and marriage records in Missouri and Kentucky will fill in more 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, you may be able to find a copy of "Background of a Bandit, the 
Ancestry of Jesse James," by Joan Beamis, which was published in 1971 and is 
available at the Library of Congress and also at Allen County Public Library, 
Fort Wayne, Ind.; Kansas State Historical Society in Topeka, Kan.; Los Angeles 
Public Library; St. Louis Public Library, and Sutro Branch of the California 
State Library in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have traced your own family, compare information about it with what 
you have on the well-known person. Does anything match? If your line does not 
merge with the famous one in surnames, localities, dates or social status, you 
probably are not related -- or the connection is so nebulous (via some marriage 
of an in-law) that it is not worthwhile pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
Or you may learn that you are indeed related to someone famous, and will be 
able to determine your exact kinship and include the information in your family 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Your ancestry is unique. Even if family traditions prove to be untrue, you will 
discover you are descended from many people of whom you can be proud, even if 
their names do not appear in the history books. The people who really made 
America were ordinary people, whose stories you should compile and preserve.

BOYCOTT SOUNDS A SOUR NOTE;

ECONOMIC SANCTIONS MAY HAVE MORE TEETH, BUT FOR MIDDLE-CLASS SOUTH AFRICANS THE 
CULTURAL CURBS HAVE MORE BITE.

SUN CITY, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sun City preserves its fondest memories in a deserted corridor away from the 
slot machines' jingle. Barry Manilow and Frank Sinatra are there on 
well-lighted posters. So are George Benson and Dolly Parton, Chicago and Queen, 
Cher and Liza. 
</P>
<P>
All have been "live at Sun City," playing for the world's biggest money in the 
Super Bowl, Africa's best-equipped music hall. On one memorable evening, Elton 
John, on his way out of town, sat down to play piano for Rod Stewart, who had 
just arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like Vegas in the old days," Jon Gathright, the theater operations 
manager, said recently, smiling at the five-year-old memories. 
</P>
<P>
But the bright stars have disappeared from the Super Bowl marquee. The other 
day the stage was being set for a Tupperware convention. After that, the hall, 
with its $2.5-million sound system and a world-class music stage crew, was 
booked for a dog show. 
</P>
<P>
The cultural boycott of South Africa, affecting everyone from crooners to 
authors to movie makers, has been one of the world's most widely applied 
sanctions. For privileged whites, generally gregarious people who yearn to be 
liked by the world, the boycott has taken an immeasurable psychological toll. 
</P>
<P>
While the cultural boycott lacks the teeth of more publicized economic 
sanctions, its effects are more deeply felt in the day-to-day lives of most 
whites, who avidly follow American popular culture and despair at being shunned 
by their favorite singers and actors. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have to understand about white South Africans is that they are part 
of the world middle class," said Eric Louw, director of the Contemporary 
Cultural Studies unit at the University of Natal in Durban. "Living in Los 
Angeles is not very different from living in the suburbs of Pretoria. Whites 
consider themselves part of that same culture." 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, a local disc jockey played the melancholy tune "Rainy Night in 
Georgia" and told his listeners wistfully: "That was Brook Benton, who came 
here long ago, back when performers still came to South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to hear these people play in my country or even to see a Woody 
Allen movie, but the situation doesn't allow for it," says an official in the 
South African Musicians' Alliance, which supports the boycott. "The boycott is 
still the only way to bring home to a lot of whites that this isn't a normal 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-apartheid leaders say the combination of the cultural boycott and economic 
sanctions imposed over the past five years have brought South Africa to where 
it is today, with black nationalist leader Nelson R. Mandela free and the 
nation's 5 million whites and 27 million blacks edging toward negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Whites already are asking how much longer they will have to be a world pariah. 
And they don't much like the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural officers of the African National Congress, the liberation movement 
largely responsible for the boycott, insist that the pressure must be 
maintained until there is evidence of concrete change, such as the dissolution 
of laws that racially segregate neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher lifted Britain's ban on cultural, 
scientific and academic links with South Africa a few days ago, no foreign 
entertainers are rushing to sign contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's way too soon," said Christopher Dalston, head of international bookings 
for Triad Artists in Century City, Calif. "Apartheid is still very much alive, 
and people at this point won't even consider South Africa until apartheid is 
gone. We have a lot of black clients, and it would be wrong for them to work 
down there." 
</P>
<P>
Hazel Feldman, a South African who travels the world in search of acts for Sun 
City, says she is encouraged by the first steps of change in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"But it would be naive to think it's going to open doors," Feldman said the 
other day. "There's a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said she thinks the single biggest restriction on American and European 
entertainers now "is no longer their own convictions about apartheid; sadly, 
it's the potential reaction of their peers." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, fears of the apartheid blacklist permeate the entertainment industry. 
Several noted agents in Los Angeles refused to even come to the phone to 
discuss the cultural boycott with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't talk about that subject at all," one secretary explained. 
</P>
<P>
Dalston conceded: "We could lose a lot of clients if we dealt down there (in 
South Africa)." 
</P>
<P>
The Commodores, a black American singing group, quietly signed a contract to 
play Sun City last July, only to pull out under pressure from anti-apartheid 
groups when the news leaked back home. Instead, the Commodores performed for 
mostly white South African audiences in Botswana and Lesotho -- sparsely 
populated countries whose capitals are only a 10-minute drive from South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, singer Laura Branigan played Sun City last year and donated 
part of her fee to the charity work of Operation Hunger. She later lost a 
booking in the Philippines because of her appearance in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's wrong," Feldman said. "Musicians go to Russia, Turkey and Chile. 
There's bloody trouble everywhere. I think music should not be used to shut out 
people, but to break down barriers between people." 
</P>
<P>
The cultural boycott reaches far beyond music, however. Many publishing firms 
have suspended shipments of books and educational materials to South Africa, 
and some American libraries still refuse to share resources with institutions 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Well-intentioned Americans are unwittingly aiding the South African government 
in its systematic starvation of young black minds," Lisa Drew, a vice president 
of William Morrow &amp; Co., and Robert Wedgeworth, dean of the School of 
Library Services at Columbia University, wrote in an article that appeared in 
the New York Times in December. They urged publishers and librarians to end the 
book boycott. 
</P>
<P>
South Africans still have access to many American movies in theaters that are 
now open to all races. A few filmmakers allow their movies to be shown only at 
film festivals sponsored by anti-apartheid organizations. And a handful, 
including Woody Allen and Spike Lee, refuse to allow their films to be screened 
here at all. 
</P>
<P>
State-run television carries American programs, from "Dallas" to "Murphy 
Brown," but other popular shows have been withdrawn. Before "The Cosby Show" 
was canceled here, it was highly popular among black South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott of South Africa and South African entertainers, like any broadly 
applied sanction, has hurt many of the people it is designed to help. 
Progressive artists inside the country, for example, find their nationality an 
almost insurmountable obstacle to building an international following. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, anti-apartheid groups agreed at a U.N. meeting in Athens last year 
to replace the total boycott with a selective boycott that will encourage 
progressive culture in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"We're saying boycott apartheid institutions in South Africa but support 
democratic institutions in South Africa," said Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's foreign 
affairs director. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes it is difficult to tell the good guys from the bad, and most 
entertainers prefer to stay away entirely. 
</P>
<P>
The starless stages of Sun City and other resorts are the best evidence of the 
cultural boycott's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Sun City is one of the areas where the cultural boycott has worked," Louw 
said. "It's affected a whole cross-section of people." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman agreed. "We're treated like a leper with AIDS," she complained. 
</P>
<P>
Sun City is a sprawling, $80-million desert resort in the nominally independent 
"homeland" of Bophuthatswana. It was targeted because the ANC saw it as part of 
the government's attempt to avoid sanctions and lend credibility to the 
homeland system, which stripped South African citizenship from about 10 million 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria created the self-governing homelands in the 1970s, when the black 
majority was agitating for a vote in national affairs. Most are located on 
desolate tracts of land, far from major urban centers, and four of them, 
including Bophuthatswana, were granted independence by South Africa and have 
black heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
But no other country has recognized their independence, and the South African 
government recently conceded the failure of its homelands system. One of the 
major questions South Africa will face in drawing up a new constitution is what 
to do with the homelands, whose black leaders are not likely to give up their 
power willingly after 11 years of independence. 
</P>
<P>
The primary sources of revenue in the homelands are gambling resorts, which 
feature casinos and soft-porn entertainment and cater largely to white 
vacationers from South Africa, where gambling and X-rated shows are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The flagship of the resorts is Sun City, about 100 miles northwest of 
Johannesburg. Frank Sinatra opened the 8,000-seat Super Bowl in 1981 and was 
followed onto the stage there by some of the best-known entertainers in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, Sun City was dealt two severe blows. The first was a protest song 
and video, "Sun City," recorded by anti-apartheid musicians and distributed 
worldwide. The second was a speech made by Pieter W. Botha, then the president 
of South Africa, who had been angered by increasing threats of sanctions and 
said his country did not need outsiders meddling in its affairs. He invited 
them to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Bookings dropped almost immediately, and about the only performers Sun City was 
able to attract were fading stars who needed the money or the rare artist who 
did not care about being blacklisted. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of groups out there hurting, and we don't pay bad money," said 
Gathright, an American who oversees Sun City's three stages. "They see us as a 
way to get financially back in good standing. We pay, and we pay well." 
</P>
<P>
Some acts have tried to turn the boycott to their advantage by issuing press 
statements falsely saying that they have turned down lucrative deals with Sun 
City, which pays entertainers $3 million to $5 million for two weekends' work. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, singer Boy George said he had turned down an offer from Sun City 
after the resort asked him to leave his black drummer at home. Feldman said Boy 
George was never invited to Sun City, and she noted that it has had several 
black artists on its stage. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl is managed by Billy Domingo, who is one of 3,500 blacks employed 
at Sun City, some of them in executive positions. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here because we did the rock 'n' roll shows," Domingo said recently. "I 
didn't come to do dog shows and car shows." Domingo has been offered jobs in 
Europe, only to have those offers withdrawn because he has a South African 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, Feldman is getting a slightly warmer reception on her trips 
to Los Angeles and other entertainment capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never really had doors slammed in my face," she said. "But I've sensed 
that I've been an embarrassment to people who've had contact with me." 
</P>
<P>
Now, though, "I have people inviting me in, wanting to hear what I have to 
say," she said. "And at least I'm not getting the old nonsense trotted out to 
me that Sun City is a place where only white people are allowed to go."

SEVERE RESTRICTIONS LAST MONTH.

Two of Southern California's best-known thrifts -- Imperial Savings in San 
Diego and Mercury Savings in Huntington Beach -- were seized Friday by 
government regulators in a further crackdown on the nation's largest troubled 
savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, the 15th-largest thrift in the nation and 12th-largest in California 
as of Sept. 30, becomes one of the largest thrifts ever seized by the federal 
government and the largest in California now under government supervision, 
surpassing Gibraltar Savings, based in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The seizures had been anticipated after both thrifts were put under severe 
operating restrictions last month as their financial conditions worsened. Those 
restrictions, which prohibited the thrifts from making even a home or car loan, 
were widely viewed as a way to control losses while regulators prepared to take 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Friday's action is sobering news for the savings and loan industry. It 
shows that regulators are unlikely to permit troubled thrift operators to stay 
in business long if they cannot meet tough new capital standards that took 
effect in December, requiring institutions to maintain a stronger financial 
safety net to protect against losses. Those new standards were enacted as part 
of the nation's massive S&amp;L bailout that is expected to cost taxpayers more 
than $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers said they viewed the seizure of Imperial and Mercury as 
a sign that regulators are stepping up their efforts to deal with large, 
troubled thrifts amid criticism from Congress that they are moving too slowly. 
Nationwide, 12 S&amp;Ls were seized Friday, bringing the total number of 
thrifts taken over since early last year to about 360. Nearly 60 nationwide and 
seven in California have been seized since Jan. 1. "A lot of the tall trees are 
getting cut down. I think they realize they have to start moving," said Bert 
Ely, a thrift consultant in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Two other major Southern California S&amp;Ls, Santa Barbara Savings and Valley 
Federal Savings, remain under strict operating rules. Many industry executives 
believe they will eventually be seized as well. 
</P>
<P>
Branches of both Mercury and Imperial will remain open under normal business 
hours, and depositors are unlikely to notice any difference. Federal government 
insurance of deposits up to $100,000 will remain in effect. Imperial has 80 
branches and Mercury has 24. 
</P>
<P>
Both thrifts were taken over by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which named 
the federal Resolution Trust Corp. as conservator, a job that includes finding 
buyers for the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial and Mercury took vastly different paths leading to Friday's seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's troubles stem from a high-flying period in the mid- to late 1980s 
when the thrift, led by former chief executive Kenneth Thygerson, became a key 
member of a group of buyers of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. That group was 
assembled by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street firm that collapsed last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 31, Imperial held slightly more than $1 billion in junk bonds, 
making it the second-largest holder of junk bonds among thrifts nationwide. 
Thrifts are required under federal law to sell all their junk bond holdings by 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds, issued by companies with low credit ratings, pay investors higher 
yields to compensate for their higher risk. Junk bonds have tumbled in value in 
the last six months, largely because of recession fears and troubles with 
junk-bond issuers such as Robert Campeau's retail chains. Imperial also 
suffered from problem car and mobile home loans. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Imperial touch," said Michael Abrahams, analyst in Los Angeles with 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "Everything they touched was junk to begin 
with. I think that, as time goes by, (lawsuits) will dig deeper and we'll find 
even more problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mercury's seizure, by contrast, was ironic. The thrift for years was viewed as 
the archetypal S&amp;L that operated conservatively in an era when renegade 
S&amp;L operators gambled taxpayer-insured deposits on such things as risky 
real estate projects and junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
That changed when Mercury, which has $2.15 billion in assets, lost $13.8 
million in 1988 and $5.4 million in the first nine months of last year, mainly 
from accounting adjustments it was forced to take because people paid off 
adjustable-rate mortgages sooner than expected. Mercury had been claiming 
future profits by assuming that those mortgages would have a much longer life. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury also had problems with two large troubled loans that financed hotels in 
Irvine and in Tulsa, Okla. Last month, it began foreclosure proceedings on the 
loans, which total $60.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of Mercury is an especially humbling blow for Leonard Shane, 67, 
who served as chairman since the S&amp;L was founded 26 years ago. Shane is 
former president of the thrift industry's main trade group, the U.S. League of 
Savings Institutions, and was often outspoken about wayward thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment specifically on the government's action, but confirmed 
that he will serve as a consultant to regulators on Mercury. Earlier this 
month, Shane stepped aside from managing the firm's day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial and Mercury had sought unsuccessfully to persuade regulators that they 
could turn around, and publicly expressed confidence that they could recover. 
Mercury had been shopped around by investment bankers for some time, but no 
buyer was found. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators said that although both institutions have been losing money, they 
hope to whip them into shape and sell them. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury is only $100,000 in the red under the common definition of insolvency, 
which is assets minus liabilities. But under new, restrictive definitions, 
Mercury has a negative $33.3 million in tangible capital, the basic cash 
available to act as a last resort against losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercury is not deeply insolvent, not way in the hole like so many other 
S&amp;Ls," said Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. "There's a good deal of marketability there, and the conservator 
will preserve what can be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
But, Smith said, Mercury also had suffered serious losses that were likely to 
continue, driving it further into debt and putting the deposit insurance fund 
at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial had $9.7 billion in assets at the end of 1989. Its parent firm, 
Imperial Corp. of America, was not seized.

Federal regulators Friday seized San Diego-based Imperial Savings Assn., the 
nation's 16th-largest S&amp;L, ending speculation over the fate of the thrift 
that earlier in the year was ordered to stop making even the most common kinds 
of loans and investments. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial becomes the largest financial institution ever to fail in San Diego 
County. It is one of the largest thrifts ever seized by the federal government 
and the largest in California now under government supervision, surpassing 
Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators on Friday said that Imperial's 80 branches throughout California 
will remain open, but that day-to-day management has been transferred to 
Resolution Trust Corp., which disposes of failed thrifts and banks. 
</P>
<P>
For Imperial customers, "It's business as usual, during normally scheduled 
hours," said Kevin Shields, spokesman for the federal Office of Thrift 
Supervision, which turned the thrift over to Resolution Trust. Deposits of up 
to $100,000 are protected by federal insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, regulators seized Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of 
Huntington Beach, a thrift with $2.16 billion in assets and negative net worth 
of $33 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the ailing thrifts had been anticipated after both were put 
under severe operating restrictions last month as their financial conditions 
worsened. Those restrictions, which prohibited the thrifts from making even a 
home or car loan, were widely viewed as a way to control losses while 
regulators prepared to take over. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Friday's seizures were sobering news for the S&amp;L industry because 
they showed that regulators are unlikely to permit troubled thrift operators to 
stay in business long if they cannot meet the tough new capital standards that 
took effect in December. Those regulations require S&amp;Ls to maintain a 
stronger financial safety net to protect against losses. The new standards are 
part of the nation's massive S&amp;L bailout, which is expected to cost 
taxpayers more than $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers said they viewed the seizures of Imperial and Mercury 
as a sign that regulators are stepping up their efforts in dealing with large, 
troubled thrifts amid criticism from Congress that they are moving too slowly. 
Nationwide, 12 S&amp;Ls were seized Friday, bringing the total number of 
thrifts seized since early last year to about 360. Nearly 60 nationwide and 
seven in California have been seized since the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
This month alone, such large problem institutions as Franklin Savings Assn. in 
Kansas, Ben Franklin Federal Savings in Oregon and CenTrust Bank in Florida 
were seized. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's seizure was not unexpected by shareholders of Imperial Corp. of 
America, Imperial's parent company. ICA's stock, which just two years ago 
traded for $19 a share, has traded at a dollar or less in recent months. 
Regulators did not seize control of ICA, but Imperial was by far ICA's most 
important asset. 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial's failure was inevitable," said Irving Katz, director of research for 
Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. "The stock price indicated that there was no 
way they could survive. It was a basket case." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, which had $9.7 billion in assets on Dec. 31, had liabilities, or 
debts, of $9.6 billion. The thrift's supply of available capital had fallen to 
a negative $60.1 million. Federal regulators said that Imperial's failure was 
driven by "a high level of risky or poor-quality assets and non-performing 
consumer and mortgage loans." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Huntington, which operated largely as a "traditional" thrift making 
low-risk loans, most of Imperial's recent problems were linked to its foray 
into the now-troubled junk bond market. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 31, Imperial held slightly more than $1 billion in junk bonds, 
making it the second-largest holder of junk bonds among thrifts nationwide. 
S&amp;Ls are required under federal law to sell all their junk-bond holdings by 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds have tumbled in value the past six months largely because of 
recession fears and troubles with junk-bond issuers such as Robert Campeau's 
department store chains. Imperial also suffered from problem car and 
mobile-home loans. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's heavy investment in junk bonds was orchestrated largely by former 
President Kenneth Thygerson. Imperial purchased most of its junk bonds through 
Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street firm that collapsed last week. 
</P>
<P>
As the value of Imperial's junk bonds plummeted, regulators forced the thrift 
to write down their value by more than $200 million. Largely due to those 
write-downs, Imperial's parent company reported a $136.2-million net loss for 
the nine-month period ended Sept. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to stem the S&amp;L's financial woes, federal regulators on Jan. 6 took 
the highly unusual action of prohibiting Imperial from making any more loans or 
investments. The federal Office of Thrift Supervision also ordered Imperial's 
managers to submit a plan that explained how Imperial could meet the strict, 
new capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L industry analysts viewed the restriction against making new loans and 
investments as a way to stem further losses until regulators could take over 
Imperial. 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial is going to make a good book for someone" to write, said Mike 
Abrahams, an S&amp;L industry analyst in Los Angeles with Bateman Eichler, Hill 
Richards. 
</P>
<P>
While Abrahams said that "junk bonds were a big issue with Imperial," he 
maintained that the S&amp;L's woes began with a $900-million wholesale consumer 
loan portfolio "that had a lot of problems . . . there was a complete lack of 
managerial control over that group." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the Imperial touch," Abrahams said. "Everything they touched was junk 
to begin with. I think that, as time goes by, (lawsuits) will dig deeper and 
we'll find even more problems." 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the S&amp;L ran into trouble when its consumer loan portfolio went 
sour, but that "the icing on the cake was when the feds ordered them to (value) 
their junk bonds at market price, not by what they paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
"That really put them under. They had negative net worth, they don't meet any 
of the new capital requirements, and they obviously weren't going to meet 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be darned . . . that's ugly, really, really ugly," said ICA shareholder 
Jim Wagner, upon hearing that regulators had seized Imperial. "It looks like 
old Ken Thygerson really pulled the old shell trick on us." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, who lives in southern Los Angeles County, had purchased $24,000 of ICA 
stock before realizing that it was facing problems linked to its junk bonds and 
the ill-fated consumer loan portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The only shareholder to publicly attack ICA's investment and loan strategy 
during last year's ICA annual meeting, Wagner on Friday blamed the thrift's 
failure on ICA's board of directors and federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury, which has $2.15 billion in assets, lost $13.8 million in 1988 and $5.4 
million in the first nine months of last year, mainly from accounting 
adjustments it was forced to take because people paid off adjustable-rate 
mortgages sooner than expected. Mercury had been claiming future profits by 
assuming those mortgages would have a much longer life. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury also had problems with two large loans that financed hotels in Irvine 
and Tulsa, Okla. Last month, it began foreclosure proceedings on the loans, 
which total $60.7 million. 
</P>
<P>

Supervision. "There's a good deal of marketability there, and the conservator 
will preserve what can be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
Mercury's 24 branches will remain open under normal business hours, regulators 
said. As is the case with Imperial, the federal government will insure deposits 
up to $100,000.

U.S. TELLS OF MEXICAN GIFTS TO ORTEGA PARTY

<P>
In a covert political operation that could prove pivotal in Nicaragua's hotly 
contested election, the ruling party of Mexico has secretly contributed more 
than $11 million in cash and supplies to the reelection campaign of leftist 
President Daniel Ortega, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions, which are said to include thousands of T-shirts, posters and 
gifts for voters as well as cash, were more than three times as valuable as the 
estimated $3.3 million in U.S. government aid that has gone to opposition 
candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they charged, the Sandinista campaign failed to report the 
contributions from Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to 
Nicaragua's Supreme Electoral Commission, as required by the country's election 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials refused to comment on the U.S. officials' charges, but 
Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez, Ortega's running mate, denied them. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a falsehood," Ramirez said in Managua on Friday evening. "We have 
declared all the donations we have received. . . . We have received nothing 
from the Mexican government or the PRI, except advisers." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials insisted that their charges are true. They said Mexican 
officials privately admitted the contributions -- although they contended that 
their value was far below $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very solid report," said Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state 
for Latin America. "The Sandinistas appear not to have complied with the very 
rules that they established." 
</P>
<P>
Aronson and other Administration officials emphasized that the reported 
contributions -- and the Sandinistas' failure to report them -- cast additional 
doubt on the fairness of the campaign leading to Sunday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Under Nicaraguan law, the Sandinistas would be required to report any foreign 
contributions and to give the Supreme Electoral Council half of any foreign 
cash donations. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said the State Department is informing the leaders of 
the major international observer groups in Nicaragua -- former President Jimmy 
Carter, former Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson, and Organization of American 
States chief Joao Baena Soares -- of the report "so they know that something 
wasn't square." 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican donation, which was first reported by the New York newspaper 
Newsday, could also cause an unexpected strain in the Bush Administration's 
so-far friendly relationship with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no desire on our part to muddy the Mexicans with this," one State 
Department official was quick to say. "We're trying to keep the focus on 
Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Still, other officials said, the incident was reminiscent of the early 1980s, 
when Mexico actively sought to thwart U.S. policies in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexicans have always seen themselves as a major power in Central America, 
and the PRI has always had a close relationship with the Sandinistas," said 
one. "That may never have changed." 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials told U.S. aides that the PRI made the contribution without 
the knowledge of Salinas or other government officials in Mexico City -- an 
assertion some officials said was difficult to believe if the donations were as 
large as $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials noted one irony in the discovery that the PRI has also sent 
advisers to Nicaragua: The PRI is widely held to have stolen Mexico's last 
presidential election by stuffing the ballot boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The reported contribution would at least explain one phenomenon in the 
Nicaraguan election campaign: the sudden appearance in Managua of thousands of 
handsomely printed Sandinista T-shirts, coffee mugs and other trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Vice President Ramirez acknowledged that the Sandinista campaign 
received about 60,000 T-shirts from Mexico, but he said they had been donated 
by private "solidarity groups," not by the government or the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would they accuse us of getting money from Mexico?" he asked. "I would 
think they would say it came from Libya, or from the Ayatollah." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas appear to have easily outspent the opposition during the 
campaign, but they have reported only about $300,000 in foreign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has provided $9 million in U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan election, but 
earmarked most of the money for officially nonpartisan voter registration and 
election monitoring groups. Approximately $3.3 million of the fund went to the 
Chamorro campaign and a group closely associated with the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
McManus reported from Washington and Miller reported from Managua.

Sniper fire escalated to mortar duels between Christian forces that killed at 
least three people, wounded 22 and jeopardized a six-day-old truce in East 
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst cease-fire violation since the truce went into effect. By 
police count, the battle for control of the Christian enclave between Samir 
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia and the rival army troops of Maj. Gen. Michel 
Aoun has killed 688 people and wounded 1,906 since it broke out Jan. 30. Geagea 
had declared his war to be over, but Aoun said the existence of two military 
forces is not acceptable.

The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a plan to tackle every phase of 
the international drug trade, from the cultivation of coca leaves and poppies 
to street-corner sales of cocaine and opium. The plan, which carries no 
immediate price tag, includes proposals for halting the smuggling of narcotics 
and the "laundering" of profits through the banking system, and for 
rehabilitating millions of addicts.

In a letter made public Friday at a conference of Jewish peace activists, the 
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, endorsed an 
active role for Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in peace talks 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the first direct indication from Arafat that he accepts the 
offer of such talks and that Arabs in the occupied lands would take the lead in 
them. Egypt, which has been working with the United States and Israel toward 
setting up Israeli-Palestinian talks, had been pressuring the PLO to give West 
Bank and Gaza leaders a prime role. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Arafat said that Palestinians in exile also would take part, a 
proposal that Israel rejects. 
</P>
<P>
"The PLO once more leaned over backward and approved the idea of a dialogue 
between representatives of the Israeli government and representatives of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories and the Diaspora," the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat demanded that the talks be aimed at reaching a "comprehensive and final 
settlement" of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on an election proposal 
put forth by Israel, as well as ideas endorsed by Egypt that include a 
withdrawal by Israel from territory occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the participation of local Palestinian leaders did not mean 
the demise of PLO influence. He suggested that Palestinians will accept only a 
settlement endorsed by the PLO. For the Palestinians, he wrote, "the only 
guarantee of their own security and their political future lies in the full 
participation of the PLO in all stages of the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that if Palestinians from abroad take part, they would be the 
most direct conduits for PLO authority. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the letter from Arafat appears to accept an offstage role by the 
PLO at least in initial stages of talks. This willingness may put pressure on 
Israel to accept an invitation from Secretary of State James A. Baker III to 
hold preliminary talks on the formation of a Palestinian peace panel. Baker 
wants to convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt to 
work out a list of Palestinian delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat's letter provided a surprise finale to a three-day international 
conference on peace sponsored by the Tel Aviv-based International Center for 
Peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Hauser, a peace activist from New York, told reporters that the letter was 
received Thursday by telefax from Tunisia, where the PLO is based. She said it 
was kept secret until Friday because organizers of the conference were unable 
to "get it fitted in" the conference's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
However, other sources at the conference said that organizers had worked for 
weeks to get such a letter sent. They had backed off at the last minute out of 
concern for appearing to interfere in sensitive diplomatic affairs. But the 
letter, dated Feb. 17, arrived anyway and the organizers had no other recourse 
but to make it public. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Hauser played a role in persuading Arafat to make pledges to renounce 
terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist. The pledges, made by Arafat in 
Geneva, led to the opening of a dialogue between the United States and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today, "The government is 
not interested in the PLO's position in peace talks." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli politics are convulsed over the issue of whether to enter peace talks. 
Shamir's Likud Party is badly split over the prospects. Many of its members 
feel that negotiations will inevitably lead to the loss of the West Bank and 
Gaza, which the rightist Likud views as part and parcel of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Friday in the Jerusalem Post, Shamir rejected any PLO 
role. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing (the PLO) should do is dismantle itself," Shamir said, "because 
its minimal demand is a Palestinian state, and a Palestinian state cannot 
coexist with Israel." 
</P>
<P>
The center-left Labor Party, which is the other pillar holding up Israel's 
coalition government, has set a two-week deadline for movement on negotiations. 
Party leaders have threatened to pull out of the government, a move that will 
lead either to a new coalition headed by Labor or Likud, or a general election. 
</P>
<P>
The talks also hold risks for Arafat. A back-seat role for the PLO could give 
unprecedented prestige to West Bank and Gaza Palestinian leaders.

Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual mentor of the Iranian-backed 
Hezbollah (Party of God), appealed for the release of 17 Western hostages in 
Lebanon, saying the West has used their plight to "disfigure the image of Islam 
and Muslims." The cleric may have been reacting to an editorial in Iran's 
pro-government Tehran Times, which said, "Regardless of the West's propaganda 
ploys, Muslim forces out of Islamic and humanitarian considerations should work 
to get hostages free with no precondition."

North Korea will hold a parliamentary election in April, six months before the 
scheduled end of the lawmakers' four-year terms, the official Korean Central 
News Agency announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The news report said the decision to hold the election for the Supreme People's 
Assembly was made in a meeting Thursday. The report, monitored in Tokyo, did 
not say why the election is being held six months early. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly, North Korea's legislature, officially is the highest government 
body, but generally serves only to ratify decisions made by the Korean Workers' 
(Communist) Party.

VILNIUS, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A visitor doesn't have to go any farther than the Central Square in front of 
Communist Party headquarters here in the Lithuanian capital to grasp the 
significance of today's republic-wide elections. 
</P>
<P>
Twin signs in the national colors of red, yellow and green -- one in Russian, 
one in Lithuanian -- proclaim, "A Lithuania without sovereignty is a Lithuania 
without a future." 
</P>
<P>
As little as two years ago, the idea of Lithuanian independence from the Soviet 
Union was still too radical for public discussion. And it was only a year ago 
that the powerful grass-roots reform movement known as Sajudis clearly embraced 
the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Now, most Lithuanian Communists proclaim independence as their goal. And it is 
clear that the republic's new Parliament, to be chosen today in the Soviet 
Union's first real multi-party elections since 1918, will be pioneers, 
attempting an unprecedented peaceful secession from the world's last great 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the new Parliament will want to put itself in the pages of history 
and declare independence," commented Algis Zukas, an aide to Lithuania's reform 
Communist president, Algirdas Brazauskas. 
</P>
<P>
More than 80% of the nearly 500 candidates competing for 141 seats in the new 
Parliament are running on platforms calling for independence. The mood of the 
ethnic Lithuanian majority in the republic is also clear. 
</P>
<P>
At a campaign debate at a school in the Kosmonautu district of Vilnius the 
other night, a disgusted Lithuanian woman stormed out after an ethnic Russian 
candidate running as an unreconstructed Communist rejected a questioner's 
contention that the republic is occupied by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't have the patience to listen to them," the woman explained. "They 
just don't understand Lithuanians." 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the independence issue is so widespread, in fact, that the 
election campaign itself has been relatively unexciting. There are campaign 
posters around, a lot of political advertising on television and daily public 
meetings at which opposing candidates answer questions from the constituents. 
</P>
<P>
There is a faint hint of American-style political glitz, such as the reform 
Communist whose official campaign portrait shows him riding a bicycle in his 
track suit, or the ethnic Russian who is depicted snuggling his young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, however, there is such a lack of street rallies or other signs of 
public enthusiasm that some politicians say they expect many voters will simply 
stay home. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't even any juicy vote-rigging scandals or other types of campaign 
skulduggery so far, according to Election Commission officials. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the heady political atmosphere that reigned here when Sajudis-backed, 
non-party candidates trounced the Communists in voting for the national 
Congress of People's Deputies last March, editor and People's Deputy Algimantas 
Cekuolis commented: "It's as if a person was hungry for weeks or months. Then 
he gorged himself, and now he doesn't want to think of food." 
</P>
<P>
The political scene has also gotten a lot more complicated here since those 
earlier elections. The Lithuanian Communist Party split in December after 
reformers under President Brazauskas divorced themselves from the policies of 
the national party leadership in Moscow. They jumped aboard the independence 
bandwagon for fear that otherwise they would be wiped out in today's elections. 
</P>
<P>
The move won the reformers an immediate boost in the opinion polls and the 
endorsement by Sajudis of 32 of their candidates for the republic's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, whose campaign literature doesn't even contain the word communism 
any more, suddenly has an unprecedented 85% public-approval rating. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas aide Zukas said in an interview that the reformed party hopes to win 
30% to 40% of the seats in the new legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A half-dozen credible new parties have also appeared since Lithuania became the 
first Soviet republic to approve a multi-party system late last year. Sajudis, 
which prefers to remain an umbrella movement rather than become a political 
party itself, has also endorsed some candidates from those new parties, as well 
as 92 non-party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the Alice-in-Wonderland country," quipped Cekuolis about the profusion 
and confusion of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Except for those Communists who still swear allegiance to Moscow -- mostly 
members of the ethnic Russian minority living in Lithuania -- the only 
difference among the rest of the parties is over the form of independence they 
seek and how hard they are ready to push for it. 
</P>
<P>
"This election will decide at what tempo and what grade of determination we 
will go to independence," said Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the Sajudis 
Executive Council. 
</P>
<P>
The reform Communists are cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the United States, it took years after the Declaration of Independence 
for this independence to become a fact of life," Brazauskas said in an 
interview with a Lithuanian newspaper earlier this month. "So, I am ready for a 
difficult road ahead on the way to our goal." 
</P>
<P>
"The question is not independence," Zukas said. "It's more how we are going to 
achieve it. The (reform) Communist Party is for achieving it in small steps." 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democrats, under economist Kazimieras Antanivicius, 52, have no 
apparent quarrel with the reform Communists' program but are anxious to 
disassociate themselves from any part in the old system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're for getting rid of the kind of socialism that existed here for 70 
years," Antanivicius told about 150 people at a defense-plant social club the 
other day. "That socialism was slavery. It was worse than feudalism." 
</P>
<P>
More to the right are the Christian Democrats, Democrats and the most radical 
Lithuanian Freedom League, which argues that the current leadership of both the 
reformist Communists and Sajudis have so discredited themselves by past 
compromise with the system that they are unfit to lead the way to independence. 
</P>
<P>
With so few issues involved, the race focuses heavily on personalities. 
</P>
<P>
The final list of candidates makes it clear that the largely inexperienced 
politicians who will be trying soon to negotiate Lithuania's independence will 
be a highly educated, mostly male and middle-aged lot. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 94% of them have college degrees, an extraordinary figure in a country 
where workers and peasants have long been allotted seats in government. 
</P>
<P>
Only 28 of the candidates are women. "This is different from all previous 
elections, when the number of women was fixed from above," said Sajudis 
Election Committee official Angonita Rupsyte. Also, she said, noting the 
hardships of everyday life in Lithuania, "it's very difficult to harmonize a 
family and politics in our conditions." 
</P>
<P>
About one-third of the candidates are under 40, another third 40 to 50 and the 
rest over 50. 
</P>
<P>
Final results of the elections may be some time coming. Run-offs may be 
required in many constituencies if fewer than half the registered voters turn 
up or no candidate manages to win more than 50% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the elections will result in the first coalition government 
in the Soviet Union since shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution. And that 
government will try to negotiate the terms of Lithuania's independence with 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging news on that front came out of Paris this week, 
where an aide to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said no one could prevent 
Lithuania's seceding from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Aide Andrei Grachev said he hopes that all three Baltic republics can be 
convinced that it is in their interest to remain in a revitalized Soviet 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
"But if this discussion doesn't convince the Lithuanian people that their 
interest is to remain within a renewed federation, they make the decision, and 
no one can prevent them from fulfilling it," Grachev said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent countries 
from just after World War I until they were annexed by the Soviet Union in 
1940. Under a secret protocol to a 1939 nonaggression treaty between Josef 
Stalin's Communist regime and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, the Communist and 
Fascist powers had conspired to carve up Eastern Europe into areas of control. 
Soviet military units began occupying the three nations that year. Annexation 
was completed after "elections" that purportedly supported the Soviet takeover. 
The nonaggression pact was abrogated on June 22, 1941, when Nazi forces 
attacked the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
Congressional Democratic leaders said Friday they are considering a proposal to 
raise income taxes on the wealthy, which could be used to help pay for a small 
reduction in Social Security taxes for middle-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, suggested by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine, would be to require upper-income 
taxpayers who now face a tax burden of 28% to pay at the higher 33% rate 
imposed on part of the income of many less affluent Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest income people should be paying the highest tax rate," Foley told 
reporters, "and not the people who are a step below." 
</P>
<P>
Although House Democrats last year failed with a similar proposal that was 
aimed at blocking President Bush's capital gains tax cut, reviving such an 
approach could help Democrats focus attention in this year's election campaign 
on the issue of tax fairness. 
</P>
<P>
The upper-income tax hike would only hit about 600,000 families with incomes 
above $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Such a tax could theoretically help pay for a rollback of this year's 
$6-billion Social Security tax hike, which increased payroll taxes from 7.51% 
to 7.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats are considering a rollback as a less expensive alternative to the 
politically appealing proposal offered by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N. 
Y.) to slash Social Security payroll taxes by $62 billion over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Not only would the Moynihan plan sharply widen the federal deficit, Democrats 
worry even more that it would also generate a political backlash among elderly 
voters who fear it as a threat to their Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats say that extending the 33% marginal tax rate paid by some 
upper-middle-class taxpayers so that it hits the top 1% of all Americans would 
be eliminating the "bubble" in today's tax code. Under current law, a family of 
four with a taxable income above roughly $210,000 pays a flat 28% rate, while 
those with incomes from about $75,000 to $210,000 pay 33% on each dollar earned 
between those levels. 
</P>
<P>
Tax analysts estimate that by bursting this bubble, the federal government 
would initially raise $3.8 billion and then generate an extra $7.6 billion in 
the first year it was fully effective. Over five years, the plan would raise 
taxes on the wealthy by $41.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The bubble seems to be kind of our crutch -- use it for child care, capital 
gains," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento). "And now (Democrats) are 
talking of it as a way to pay for rolling back the Social Security tax 
increase." 
</P>
<P>
But Democratic leaders conceded that President Bush has the power to thwart any 
proposed tax hike and Mitchell cautioned against mounting a futile attack in 
the face of White House opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not going to be a Democratic light cavalry charge on that (tax) 
issue," the Senate leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, however, said that trying to raise tax rates on the wealthy to 33% would 
not qualify as the kind of "quixotic activities" he also wants to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
And Mitchell suggested that Democrats need to find some way to challenge Bush 
on taxes. Former President Ronald Reagan "proposed and supported and signed 
into law 13 tax increases and in the process convinced everyone in America that 
he was against all of them," Mitchell said. "President Bush has got the 
(anti-tax) words down right but it remains to be seen whether he has the 
political skill to (accomplish) the same result." 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic leaders said that a House-Senate task force led by House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephart of Missouri is continuing to look at a 
number of alternatives to the Moynihan payroll tax cut. But both Mitchell and 
Foley hinted that Democratic lawmakers are backing away from a trial balloon 
floated earlier this week of providing an income tax credit to middle-income 
taxpayers for part of their Social Security tax payment.

SHERIFF CAN USE ARMORY AS JAIL FOR TWO WEEKS

<P>
After a weeklong standoff with the state, a sheriff with a crowded jail won 
permission Friday to keep a makeshift prison at a National Guard armory for at 
least two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge endorsed a temporary settlement between the state, which 
owns the armory, and Hampden County Sheriff Michael Ashe, who seized part of 
the building Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Ashe, whose action sparked a war of words with the state and drew support from 
many citizens, said he had just decided to "go out and do what I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff was under a federal court order forbidding him to hold more than 
500 prisoners in the 102-year-old Hampden County Jail, which is designed to 
house 279 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Nineteen inmates were held Friday at the temporary lockup at the armory, in a 
large room with a concrete floor and a volleyball net stretched between the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a victory for the people," Ashe said after the hearing in which 
lawyers for the county and state agreed to let him keep using the armory until 
March 12. On that day, both sides are to report back with a permanent solution, 
or a hearing will be held on the sheriff's request for an injunction allowing 
him to keep using the armory. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement approved by Judge George Keady, Ashe agreed to allow the 
Guard to keep operating out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what we wanted to do is keep it on the front burner but turn down the 
heat," said Lawrence Fletcher-Hill, assistant state attorney general.

GIRL FOUND -- MOTHER WAS JAILED 2 YEARS FOR HIDING HER; 
</P>

Seven-year-old Hilary Foretich, whose mother spent more than two years in jail 
as part of a bitter legal battle over alleged sexual abuse by her father, has 
been located in New Zealand with her maternal grandparents, her parents 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hilary's mother, plastic surgeon Elizabeth Morgan, said that her daughter has 
been staying in New Zealand with Morgan's parents, and that they are seeking 
court approval to remain in that country indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Hilary's discovery already has touched off a complex tangle of international 
litigation as both parents seek to reclaim her. A court hearing is scheduled in 
New Zealand next week over the issue of who should have custody of the child. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is great, " Morgan said in an interview Friday night. "I called 
twice today. I talked to my parents. Hilary is doing fine." 
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand authorities "seem to really care about children," Morgan said. 
"That's all I want. That's all I've ever wanted. I have confidence they will 
put her welfare first." 
</P>
<P>
Hilary's father, Virginia oral surgeon Eric A. Foretich, said the girl was 
found as a result of an international search conducted on his behalf by several 
teams of attorneys and private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"I found my daughter through my own private means," Foretich said in an 
interview. "This is the culmination of two arduous, very painful years. But 
just to know that she's alive means so much to me." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan sent Hilary into hiding in 1987 after she became convinced that the 
child was being sexually abused by her ex-husband. Foretich has vehemently 
denied the accusation, contending that it was Morgan who did the molesting. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was imprisoned in a Washington jail on Aug. 28, 1987, because she defied 
a court order to produce her child for unsupervised visits with Foretich. 
Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon Jr. said he found the evidence of sexual 
abuse inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was released last Sept. 25 after President Bush signed a law, enacted 
specifically on Morgan's behalf, that placed a one-year limit on civil contempt 
imprisonments in child custody cases in the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand authorities said they learned that Hilary and her grandparents, 
William and Antonia Morgan, were in the country after they applied for 
permanent residency. They have been living in a motel in Christchurch, where 
Hilary reportedly had been attending private school. 
</P>
<P>
The Morgans and their granddaughter had moved to New Zealand from England, 
where they had lived more more than a year, according to an account published 
in the London Times. The child was using the name Ellen Morgan, friends of the 
family confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The London Times report said that information about Hilary's whereabouts was 
disclosed by a BBC television producer who was faced with the threat of jail 
for contempt of court. The producer reportedly had been served with a court 
order obtained by Foretich. 
</P>
<P>
The producer's knowledge of Hilary was based on information provided by a 
teacher in Plymouth, England, who recognized a picture of Hilary on a 
television documentary, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher said that Hilary was a former student at Beechfield College, a 
private prep school, and had left in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said that Hilary is being represented by a court-appointed attorney and 
is being evaluated by an expert in child psychology. Foretich has been 
prohibited from having any contact with his daughter pending the outcome of the 
evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said she will attempt to join her daughter and her parents in New 
Zealand if she can persuade Judge Dixon to return her passport. She intends to 
renew a request for the passport on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich said he has had a team of lawyers and detectives working both in 
England and New Zealand and intends to travel to New Zealand soon to press his 
legal efforts to obtain custody of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich said the information provided by the teacher "helped piece things 
together." Based on a tip he received last week, his investigators located 
Hilary and her grandparents at a motel in Christchurch, Foretich said. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I am going over there," Foretich said. "I will probably be over 
there for some time. It's going to be a dogfight. I expect Elizabeth Morgan to 
apply her slander, her same tactics there, as she did here. I expect her to 
generate a lot of media attention." 
</P>
<P>
Foretich said the passports of Hilary and her grandparents have been 
confiscated by New Zealand authorities, and they have been restricted to the 
motel pending the outcome of the custody hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich's attorney, Elaine Mittleman, said the custody fight will be 
complicated by the fact that New Zealand has not signed the Hague Convention on 
the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. 
</P>
<P>
The international agreement specifies that abducted children are to be returned 
to their preabduction status and location until legal custody is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, the courts of New Zealand will have to do something," 
Mittleman said. "We just don't know what. It's one more battle. We're 
apprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan separated from Foretich shortly before Hilary was born. Both parents 
claim not to have seen the child since Morgan sent her into hiding in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The legal battle over Hilary commanded national attention as Morgan became a 
cause celebre for women's rights groups and other supporters who applauded her 
willingness to go to jail to protect her child. Her detractors, however, saw 
Morgan as a woman who simply defied the law.

EX-EXECUTIVE PLEADS GUILTY IN NAVY CONTRACT FRAUD

A former executive of a United Technologies Corp. division pleaded guilty 
Friday to conspiring to illegally obtain inside information about a Pentagon 
competition for a lucrative Navy contract. 
</P>
<P>
Roger K. Engel, 49, a former vice president of the company's Norden Systems 
division in Norwalk, Conn., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Engel, who agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation of 
Pentagon procurement fraud called Operation Ill Wind, could receive a five-year 
sentence and be fined up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va., scheduled sentencing 
for May 11. 
</P>
<P>
Engel is the third former Norden Systems executive to plead guilty to 
participating in the conspiracy to obtain inside bid information about a 
$150-million contract to build a battlefield air traffic-control system for the 
Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
A former senior vice president of Norden, James E. Rapinec, 54, and C. J. 
Richardson, a former marketing executive, pleaded guilty in December and are 
also cooperating with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
The three men have admitted that they arranged in 1988 for Norden to pay 
defense consultant Thomas E. Muldoon $49,500 to get information about the 
Navy's contract competition from his contacts in the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
Muldoon was paid $27,500 before the Ill Wind investigation was disclosed in 
June, 1988, when FBI agents searched the offices of a number of defense 
contractors. Muldoon was sentenced last week to 27 months in prison in an 
unrelated procurement case.

CUSTODY CASE CHILD IS SAID FOUND SAFE IN NEW ZEALAND

<P>
Seven-year-old Hilary Foretich, whose mother spent more than two years in jail 
rather than let her visit her father, reportedly has been found safe in the 
custody of her maternal grandparents in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan was found at a motel in Christchurch with 
her grandparents, WRC-TV reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
District of Columbia police spokesman Quintin Peterson said police were 
attempting to confirm that the girl was in New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
But Sgt. Russell Hawks, a detective investigating the case in New Zealand, said 
she had been living in the city "for some time." 
</P>
<P>
"She's fine, in a healthy state, no problems there at all," Hawks said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Another police official told the Associated Press that the case was already 
before a family-court judge and that the girl was in the custody of the 
grandparents. He declined to be specific about the case, and would not confirm 
that the girl in question was Hilary. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan and Foretich were not immediately available for comment. Hilary's 
court-appointed guardian, Linda Holman, and one of Morgan's attorneys, Adrian 
Roe, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan spent 25 months in jail for civil contempt of court rather than disclose 
the girl's whereabouts. She maintained that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, 
had sexually abused the girl, and she refused to give him court-ordered 
visitation rights. Foretich has denied abusing the child. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was released from jail in September after President Bush signed a law 
limiting civil contempt in District of Columbia child-abuse cases to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter for Radio New Zealand, Jill Gallop, told the television station that 
police had confirmed that Hilary and her grandparents, Morgan's parents, have 
been in Christchurch for three years. The grandparents last year sought 
permission to live in New Zealand permanently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's identity was revealed when New Zealand authorities checked with U.S. 
officials to determine if there were any outstanding court orders pertaining to 
the child, Gallop said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for a Morgan support group said the group was upset that Hilary 
had been found. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope New Zealand will give her sanctuary," said Alice Monroe of the Friends 
of Elizabeth Morgan. "There's no reason for her to be sent back here." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan has vowed that she would go without seeing her daughter until the girl 
turned 18, if necessary to protect her. 
</P>
<P>
Foretich has created a fund and appealed for donations to pay for efforts to 
search for his daughter. He said the costs of his legal battle with Morgan and 
fees charged by previous private investigators have left him financially 
strapped.

HOUSE REPORT SEES PERIL IN INSURANCE INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATORS: PARALLELS TO THE S&amp;L CRISIS ARE CITED. STUDY FINDS 'SCANDALOUS 
MISMANAGEMENT' COULD SET OFF WIDESPREAD FAILURES. 
</P>

<P>
The insurance industry is threatened by "scandalous mismanagement and 
rascality" that could trigger widespread failures similar to the massive crisis 
in the savings and loan industry, according to a House subcommittee report 
issued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The parallels between the present situation in the insurance industry and the 
early stages of the savings and loan debacle are both obvious and deeply 
disturbing," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee's oversight subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The report said more than 150 property and casualty insurance firms have become 
insolvent since 1969, with nearly half the failures taking place in the last 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the biggest failures, including the collapse of two Los Angeles firms, 
Mission Insurance and Transit Casualty, ultimately will cost the public more 
than $5 billion, the subcommittee study said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies falling into trouble often expanded too rapidly, failed to hold 
sufficient financial reserves and suffered from reckless management, said the 
report, titled "Failed Promises -- Insurance Company Insolvencies." 
</P>
<P>
The insurance business "is uniquely suited to abuse by mismanagement and 
fraud," according to the study. "The prepayment of large, often vast, sums of 
money with few restrictions lends itself naturally to monumental wasting of 
assets through greed, incompetence and dereliction of duty." 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry executives said their business is generally in good shape 
and accused the subcommittee of exaggerating the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We are greatly troubled by the analogy drawn to the S&amp;L industry," said 
Marc Rosenberg, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute. 
</P>
<P>
"There were four major insolvencies they looked at, and in those four they 
found characteristics of improper, if not criminal, behavior," Rosenberg said. 
"If you walk into a morgue and four bodies are being autopsied, you find a 
cause of death for those four. You do not find any information about whether 
the rest of the population has cause to worry. The subcommittee report moves 
from the specific to the general too quickly." 
</P>
<P>
The American Council of Life Insurance "considers insolvency developments 
important enough to have formed a task force to identify the problems more 
fully," said Benno Isaacs, an ACLI spokesman. "But we do not foresee a serious 
threat to our members." 
</P>
<P>
Isaacs noted that a Congressional Research Service report last summer declared 
the industry in good shape. "The insurance industry has had an excellent record 
in that insolvencies have been rare, and in cases that have occurred, 
regulators and guarantee funds have usually prevented loss to the 
policyholders," the research service said. "It must be emphasized that there 
are no signs of imminent crisis for this industry." 
</P>
<P>
However, the subcommittee report focused on the significant potential for 
financial abuses. 
</P>
<P>
The "record of inquiry on both the insurance and thrift industries shows that a 
relatively few crooks, scoundrels and incompetents are capable of bankrupting 
huge companies, and possibly an entire industry," the subcommittee report said. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell called for intensified activity by state insurance commissioners to 
keep the industry financially sound. "The regulatory system must anticipate and 
deal effectively with the activities of the pirates and dolts who inevitably 
will plague an attractive industry, such as insurance, where customers hand 
over large sums of cash in return for a promise of future benefits," Dingell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia, 
said that "particularly in the aftermath of the savings and loan catastrophe, 
Congress must make certain that all insurers are financially able to pay 
claims. While most insurers are sound, flaws in existing regulation need to be 
promptly addressed to prevent insurance insolvencies from spreading." 
</P>
<P>
The report included an extensive review of the problems at Mission Insurance, 
which was placed into conservatorship by the California Department of Insurance 
in 1985, and liquidated in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mission aggressively sold vast numbers of property insurance policies and then 
reinsured this business with other companies. "Most of those were unlicensed 
carriers that could not write policies themselves, so Mission was the 'front' 
to write business that was immediately transferred to the books of unregulated 
companies," the subcommittee said. 
</P>
<P>
When claims were filed, the re-insurance companies couldn't make payments to 
Mission, which in turn, couldn't pay the policyholders. The system failed. 
"Like an empty fire extinguisher, it looked fine until it was needed," the 
report said.

DRIVER WHO KILLED 27 GETS 16-YEAR TERM; 
</P>
<P>
DRUNKENNESS: DEFENSE ATTORNEYS' PLAN FOR PROBATION IS REJECTED BY KENTUCKY 
JUDGE.

<P>
A man convicted of killing 27 people in the nation's worst drunk-driving 
accident was sentenced Friday to 16 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll County Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite denied a defense motion to 
place Larry Mahoney on probation, and instead imposed the sentence recommended 
by the jury that convicted the 36-year-old chemical-plant worker Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Satterwhite said the community would not stand for probation and that 
punishment must be strong for such a serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
One survivor of the crash, 18-year-old Tammy Darnell, said Mahoney should have 
been sent to prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen years does not take the place of the friends I lost," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney was driving the wrong direction on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, when 
he crashed into the front of a school bus packed with teen-agers on a church 
outing. Twenty-four teen-agers and three adults died in the fiery crash. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney was convicted of 27 counts each of second-degree manslaughter and 
first-degree wanton endangerment, 12 counts of first-degree assault, 14 of 
second-degree wanton endangerment and one of drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended sentence totaled 611 years, but the jury said the terms should 
run concurrently. That effectively gave Mahoney 16 years. He is classified as a 
violent offender under Kentucky law and must serve at least half of his 
sentence before being considered for parole. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney William Summers, one of Mahoney's three attorneys, urged 
Satterwhite to make something positive out of the tragedy. The defense 
recommended a probation plan under which Mahoney would have lectured to 
schoolchildren about the dangers of drunk driving, served volunteer time in 
hospital emergency wards, and spent one year in a work-release program. 
</P>
<P>
"Judge, we must do as much good with this as we possibly can. His punishment 
has already been death. He already has been given a life sentence," Summers 
said, referring to Mahoney's suffering since the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky Jr. of the state attorney general's office opposed 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
"He alone is responsible. He alone brought us to this place today," Richwalsky 
said. "Regardless of statements the defense would make, it's time for 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Russell Baldani, another of Mahoney's attorneys, had said earlier that 
Satterwhite's decision would be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
During testimony, jurors learned that Mahoney was upset over financial problems 
brought on by expensive medical bills for his daughter, who suffers from a 
spinal birth defect. He spent most of the day of the crash visiting friends and 
drinking beer at several taverns, according to testimony. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that he only occasionally drank beer and abhorred hard liquor. He 
said he did not remember drinking hard liquor at a party later that evening. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had no recollection of getting into his pickup and driving the wrong 
way on the interstate. 
</P>
<P>
The collision punctured the gas tank of the bus, sending a stream of flaming 
gasoline into the passenger compartment. 
</P>
<P>
The 27 deaths were attributed to smoke inhalation, but Mahoney's attorneys 
contended that toxic smoke emitted from the plastic seats poisoned the 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
When Mahoney took the stand, he apologized for the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Richwalsky said earlier in the week that he did not expect Friday's hearing to 
be the last of the Mahoney case. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over and done with," he said. "I'm sure there will be an appeal and 
so we change gears and go into another arena."

Voter opinion on Proposition 111, the state measure that would raise gasoline 
taxes for road improvements and transit systems, is now evenly divided, 
according to the latest California Poll. 
</P>
<P>
The poll results, released this week, found that 46% of the 1,007 voters 
questioned earlier this month were in favor of the measure and 46% were against 
it. Proposition 111 will be on the June ballot. Soon after the Oct. 17 Bay Area 
earthquake, the proposition was favored 55% to 45% in a California Poll.

<P>
State schools Supt. Bill Honig has announced plans to seek a 1992 ballot 
initiative to raise the taxes of the "super rich" unless the governor and 
Legislature act first on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We should raise (state) taxes by 5% on the top 1% of families in this state," 
Honig said Thursday as he introduced the idea at a California Taxpayers' Assn. 
meeting. Honig said the 5% increase would affect families making more than 
$208,560 a year who pay less in combined federal and state taxes than those who 
earn $70,000 or more. Honig said his proposal would raise $2 billion a year to 
finance California's future education, transportation and health care needs. If 
he follows through with his plan, Honig probably would have to seek a ballot 
initiative, given Gov. George Deukmejian's steadfast opposition to tax 
increases.

TRAFFIC SPAT VICTIM HAD PREGNANT WIFE

<P>
A surprise baby shower planned for today won't be held. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gloria Sanchez's mother, sisters and brother will be in a hospital 
maternity ward keeping a close eye on the young woman, who is due next week. 
She was hospitalized early after learning that her husband had been shot to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Marco Anthony Sanchez, 24, was shot and killed on a Pacific Beach street 
Thursday, and Howard Barton Jr. was booked on suspicion of murder. He was being 
held without bail in County Jail, said Sgt. Ray E. Sigwalt of the San Diego 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's death, stemming from a heated exchange of words in traffic, has left 
his in-laws in shock. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell you things all the time when you are driving," said his 
mother-in-law, Nellie Goodwin, as she wiped her tears with a paper towel. "But 
that doesn't mean you can shoot them." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was on his way to send some packages to Goodwin's family in Texas, she 
said, from a store in the 1000 block of Garnet Avenue, that is owned by 
Goodwin's husband. 
</P>
<P>
It all began about 10 a.m. at Grand Avenue and Ingraham Street in Pacific 
Beach. Riding with Sanchez was one of his sisters-in-law. In a car in front of 
them was Andrea Barton, 20. 
</P>
<P>
"The lady was in front of us and she was going really slow, so Marco honked," 
said Sanchez's 12-year-old sister-in-law. "Then she went fast and slammed on 
her brake. . . . Marco got in front of her and she tried to cut him off." 
</P>
<P>
The two drivers traded insults, she said, with each one trying to get in front 
of the other. Police reports said Barton's car had been stalled in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"She gave him the finger, and he gave her the finger and it was just going back 
and forth," said the 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
"She turned off, and . . . Marco spit on her car, on her window. And I guess 
she saw where we parked. When we parked, she went and got her dad." 
</P>
<P>
They unloaded some of the boxes and took them into a Garnet Avenue store where 
they were going to mail them. Then Sanchez told the girl that Andrea Barton had 
come back with her father, Howard Barton. 
</P>
<P>
After Sanchez left the store, he walked into a nearby sporting goods shop and 
the Bartons followed him. The three of them argued inside the sports shop, then 
stepped outside. Sanchez then got into his car. 
</P>
<P>
A witness to the shooting said that he saw Barton yelling into the driver's 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Barton) was over on the driver's side and he had a gun out. And he was 
yelling at the guy to get out of the car that he was going to shoot him," Daryl 
Zack, who manages a store on Garnet Avenue, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that, I think, twice. Then, there was a little pause. The next thing I 
heard him say was, 'Put the knife down or I'm gonna shoot you.' He might have 
said it one more time. Right after he said it, there was a pop." 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez got out of the car then staggered back into the store where his 
sister-in-law was. "He came in . . . he just fell on the floor," the 
12-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Barton is a real estate agent who works out of an office in the 4900 
block of Cass Street. Two agents who share the office with him were stunned by 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
They both declined to give their names, but one of them said of Barton: "He's a 
good, solid family man. . . . His father was a gentleman and so is he." Barton, 
46, is a La Jolla resident. 
</P>
<P>
A clerk at the sporting goods store where the three people argued, Melissa 
Kropp, said she has known Andrea Barton since high school. Although she does 
not know the father very well, Kropp described Andrea Barton as "just a normal 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Sigwalt said Sanchez was shot in the upper right back. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez was described by his mother-in-law as a good young man who took care of 
her daughter. Her daughter and Sanchez met about five years ago, were married 
in June and lived in National City. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen her so happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Sanchez treated Gloria's 6-year-old son as if the child were his 
own. "He took him everywhere," she said. And if Sanchez could not be found, it 
was because he was playing Nintendo with the little boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He had so many plans," Goodwin said. She said Sanchez planned to build her a 
gazebo and plant a garden for her. "Now it's just half way," she said.

NEIGHBORS UNITE TO PONDER CRIME IN CLAIREMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilman Bruce Henderson, whose district includes the Clairemont 
neighborhood where two young women have been stabbed to death in the past six 
weeks, said Friday that investigators have told him they don't believe the 
slayings are the work of a single, serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
"Police have indicated to me that there are certain dissimilarities in each 
case, enough to suggest that they were committed by separate suspects," 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, a standing-room-only crowd of about 400 gathered in the 
conference room of a Clairemont apartment complex, near where both slayings 
occurred, to address just that concern -- that a serial killer might be loose. 
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting was over, several people complained of what one man called a 
"stunning" rise of crime in Clairemont. A representative of the San Diego 
Police Department conceded that the drug problem in the area is "serious." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Clairemont is known for labs that manufacture crystal 
methamphetamine, and that burglaries in the area are dramatically on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
"And, as I'm sure you know, most arrests for burglary are drug-related," said 
Jim Watkins, a public affairs officer in the Northern Division, which covers 
Clairemont and nearby beach areas. 
</P>
<P>
But what brought most people to the meeting was the fear that a serial killer 
might be responsible for the slayings of two area residents. The two crimes 
bear striking similarities. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Paige Schultz, 20, an English major at San Diego State University who 
moonlighted as a nude dancer at a Loma Portal nightclub, was found stabbed to 
death in her apartment in the 3100 block of Cowley Way on Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Janene Marie Weinhold, 21, a UC San Diego political science major, was found 
stabbed to death in her apartment in the 3300 block of Clairemont Drive, two 
blocks from where Schultz lived, exactly five weeks later, on Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Burns, a 28-year-old construction worker engaged to Schultz, was 
arrested shortly after he reported finding her body and was held for five days 
in County Jail. He was released when the San Diego County district attorney did 
not issue a murder complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives maintain that Burns remains a prime suspect, and that they 
believe Schultz's killing was "domestic" in nature. But, on Friday, Sgt. Ray 
Sigwalt, the investigator handling both cases, declined to discuss parallels 
between the two killings. 
</P>
<P>
Weinhold lived in the Buena Vista Gardens apartments, whose management 
organized Friday night's meeting at Henderson's behest. Schultz lived in a 
condominium in Canyon Ridge, which is run by the same company, Anza Management 
of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Rosborough, a spokeswoman for the company, announced Friday night that 
tenants would be provided -- beginning today -- 24-hour armed security patrols, 
with no fewer than three officers on duty at any time. She and two police 
representatives also announced the formation of a Neighborhood Watch chapter 
for the sprawling Buena Vista Gardens and Canyon Ridge apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the tenants seemed happy with the results. Several asked angrily if 
this would mean an increase in rents. Abe Rochester, 82, who attended the 
meeting with his wife, Rose, 78, said the elderly were concerned with the rise 
of crime in the neighborhood, particularly with the two slayings, but were 
outraged over numerous rent hikes. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived here nine years, and we've had four to five major rent increases," 
Rochester said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosborough responded "absolutely not" to questions about a rent increase, but 
Betsy Keller, an Anza representative, said rents for each tenant are evaluated 
annually and will continue to be. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Wisted, 29, who lives with her husband in Buena Vista Gardens, said that, 
through her work as a clerk with the San Diego Police Department, she has 
researched the rise of crime in Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is, the management of these complexes (Buena Vista Gardens and 
Canyon Ridge) have not done enough to beef up security, and they regularly 
increase the rents," she said. "I live in a one-bedroom apartment, and my rent 
was just raised from $600 to $645 a month."

A QUICK HALT TO THE SPRAYING IS UNLIKELY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: CITIES WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT MALATHION IS DANGEROUS AND, EXPERTS SAY, 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SWAY A JUDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts in environmental law say Los Angeles and other Southern California 
cities stand little chance of winning a quick halt in court to the state's 
aerial spraying of malathion, aimed at killing the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
They say the cities would have to prove the spraying is dangerous. So far, they 
have been able to point only to studies that suggest it might be. 
</P>
<P>
This weaker position is probably not enough to persuade a judge to overrule 
Gov. George Deukmejian, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has declared, in effect, that minimal health risks are worth taking 
to combat the Medfly, whose presence, he contends, constitutes an emergency 
threat to the state's agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
When the governor declares an emergency, judges tend to scramble out of his 
way, much like motorists making room for an ambulance. Unless it can be shown 
that the governor turned on his "siren" irresponsibly, judges probably will not 
block him. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very much that a judge would intervene," said UCLA law professor Henry 
W. McGee Jr., unless there is "some very powerful proof" that spraying makes 
people sick. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state has repeatedly used helicopters to spray small sections of 
Los Angeles County, the only comparable large-scale spraying of an urban area 
occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1981 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Legal challenges to that spraying got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the current fight, seven cities, including Los Angeles, have taken the state 
to court. It is unclear, however, how determined some of them are. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city councils of three Orange County cities -- Huntington 
Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster -- gave their lawyers 36 hours to prepare a 
lawsuit asking judges to immediately stop the spraying. One Medfly expert said 
the lawyers were in such a hurry that they turned down his offer of 
information, saying they had no time to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, a Superior Court judge in Sacramento rejected these cities' bids 
out of hand. The councils have not authorized further legal actions, one of the 
lawyers said. A similar effort by the city of Pomona in Superior Court also was 
dismissed, although officials there say they anticipate the council will 
authorize additional attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than ask for immediate intervention, the cities of Los Angeles, Glendale 
and Burbank decided to bide their time when they filed suit this week. 
</P>
<P>
Keith W. Pritsker, a Los Angeles deputy city attorney who played a key role in 
drafting these cities' suits, said he recognized there was almost no chance 
that a Superior Court judge would intervene at the drop of a hat. Therefore, 
Pritsker said, the cities did not ask him to. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they said in a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court, they would ask 
for an injunction later -- presumably in several weeks -- after they had built 
a better case. 
</P>
<P>
City lawyers said they would use the additional time and court procedures to 
compel the state to turn over the entire documentary record of why officials 
decided to spray malathion and why they believe the spraying is safe. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the cities hope to show that the governor's emergency declaration 
was a sham concocted to keep agricultural interests happy and avoid the 
requirements of state environmental laws. The laws require a fair-minded impact 
study, with public participation, whenever an action such as spraying may 
significantly affect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
They also hope the documents will show that the governor and state agricultural 
officials did not consider less-risky alternatives to aerial spraying such as 
stripping trees of fruit in affected areas and introducing a parasite known to 
feed on the fruit fly's larvae. 
</P>
<P>
The cities have a substantial ally in the Natural Resources Defense Council, a 
national, nonprofit environmental group that filed its own suit along with more 
than a dozen state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
While the cities' interest may be short-term -- stopping the spraying to 
protect the health of its residents -- the Natural Resources group is seeking 
long-range reform of pest control practices statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The state says it was not required to do an environmental impact report on the 
aerial spraying because the California Environmental Quality Act specifically 
allows impact studies to be skipped in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
But the cities argue that state agricultural officials brought the disputed 
emergency on themselves by failing to plan alternative methods for combating 
the Medfly infestations that have been detected in California periodically 
since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
As Pritsker said: "Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency 
on our part." 
</P>
<P>
Both the cities and the Natural Resources Defense Council are demanding that an 
environmental impact assessment be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a back-and-forth argument that seems likely to intensify, Deputy Atty. 
Gen. Charles Getz said state agricultural officials have already completed the 
"functional equivalent" of an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
The adequacy of this so-called "functional equivalent" is likely to be the key 
issue in court, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
In the only suit that succeeded in stopping aerial spraying of a pesticide in 
California, Northern California environmentalists and organic farmers won an 
injunction in 1985 to stop the state from spraying the pesticide Imidan against 
an infestation of apple maggot fruit flies. The state had planned to spray 
Imidan statewide for up to seven years but did not carry out an environmental 
impact assessment or, the courts found, an equivalent study. 
</P>
<P>
After a court-ordered halt to that spraying, the Legislature enacted a statute 
to make it easier for state agricultural officials to claim they had done an 
equivalent study. 
</P>
<P>
The new law provided that any time the state approved a pesticide for regular 
agricultural use, it was the "functional equivalent" of an environmental impact 
report. The cities hope to show, with the state's own documents, that this 
registration procedure is inadequate to be considered the equivalent of an 
environmental impact report, regardless of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said they also hope to show that the state manipulated data 
for political reasons by overplaying the Medfly's potential economic cost to 
farmers and underplaying health risks to city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the state have said farmers face $200-million-a-year losses if the 
Medfly infestation is not stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Mary D. Nichols, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
said the state's claim that it needs aerial spraying to "eradicate" the Medfly 
is misleading and wasteful. The Medfly appears to be indigenous to California, 
she said, and probably cannot be eradicated. Probably, it can only be 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we are talking (about an attempt to control a long-term problem), we 
have the time and the necessity to sit down and look at the full range of 
options," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the detection of the Medfly an emergency, she said, "becomes an excuse 
for not evaluating alternatives" such as using the "mini-wasp," a parasite that 
feeds on the larvae of the Medfly, that could be introduced into the state 
along with sterile Medflies in a program that might take a year or so to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction between controlling and eradicating the Medfly is also 
significant because it determines who pays for a program that is expected to 
cost $30 million by June, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency eradication programs -- at $20,000 per helicopter flight -- are 
financed by general tax dollars. By law, long-term management and control 
programs are financed by agricultural interests, she said.

TEEN-AGE WAR GAMES FLIRT WITH FRONTIER OF DANGER; 
</P>
<P>
THE BORDER: YOUTHS CARRYING FAKE ARMS DO MOCK BATTLE IN CANYONS NEAR 
U.S.-MEXICO LINE, WHERE REAL-LIFE VIOLENCE IS ROUTINE.

Armed with guns that shoot paint and BBs, a few dozen teen-agers regularly play 
war games in the darkened canyons near the U.S.-Mexico border. The participants 
belong to groups with names such as Metal Militia or Sudden Death and regularly 
do battle starting about 9 Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I do it to prepare for my future in the military," said Jason MacAllister, a 
17-year-old Imperial Beach resident. "And, yeah, it's fun, it's really fun." 
</P>
<P>
The teens act on their own, without adult supervision, in an area that is 
riddled with violence. Border Patrol agents encountered the groups at least 
three times in December and January and say the youths pose a twofold danger: 
Their guns could be mistaken for real by agents in the canyons or they could be 
hurt by criminals prowling the region. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's dark and we can't tell in the dark whether those are real 
guns. The danger is . . . if they come at one agent waving one of those guns," 
said Ted Swofford, spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
"And there are an awful lot of bandits in that area. We get assaults, rapes and 
robberies on a fairly regular basis. I sure wouldn't want my kids out there." 
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, law enforcement officers have killed eight people while 
patrolling the border area, said Lt. Gary Learn of the San Diego Police 
Department's homicide unit. In 1988, five homicides were reported; more recent 
figures are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Non-fatal shootings are not uncommon. In one recent case, a controversial 
shooting involving police left a 17-year-old Mexican boy paralyzed. The youth 
wielded a screwdriver and the Border Crime Intervention officers mistook it for 
a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
But MacAllister and other boys said they do not worry about their safety. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are in Vietnam, you should be scared. But this is not Vietnam," said 
15-year-old David, who declined to give his last name. 
</P>
<P>
The boys play war games instead of cowboys-and-Indians. The groups have 
officers, such as MacAllister, who has attained the rank of "colonel." For 
them, Sylvester Stallone is a hero. In their mock battles, those who are shot 
must drop and be counted as dead. Surviving in the underbrush is more important 
than winning at Space Invaders. 
</P>
<P>
But parents are concerned. David's mother, who also declined to give her name, 
said she worries but has confidence that her ninth-grade son can take care of 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I didn't like it," said MacAllister's mother, who declined to use 
her first name. "I can't really get used to it. But either he goes out there 
with my permission or he goes out there without it. I'm stuck -- I taught him 
to be independent. I wish I could be there to guard him, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the boys come from South Bay high schools. Eight attend Mar Vista High, 
said school principal Jaime Mercado, who added that the school does not 
encourage nor support the boys' activities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stupid and ridiculous and utterly non-thinking to allow your son to be 
out there, even if it's nothing but war games, which apparently are popular," 
Mercado said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said police and Border Patrol officials, who have 
encountered the teen-agers, should discuss the boys' activities with parents 
and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
"They should tell parents and schools that is not appropriate for the kids to 
be in that area, and that there is great danger," Bates said. "I don't think 
they should be there at all -- and certainly not playing war in uniform and 
armed." 
</P>
<P>
In letters, Bates last week asked San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen and 
Sweetwater Union High School District Supt. Anthony Trujillo to investigate the 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol's encounters with the youths occurred around Dairy Mart Road, 
about 3 miles from the border crossing. The first time, on Dec. 9, the agents 
mistook the 12 youths for illegal aliens, said Lt. Bill Brown of the Southern 
Division of the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose ages range from 13 to 18, were dressed in camouflage and 
toting plastic pistols, air guns, nunchakus, knives and slingshots, according 
to Dale Cozart, Chief Patrol Agent with INS. The teen-agers, encountered at 10 
p.m., said they were playing war. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, border agents came across seven youths carrying air guns. 
Then, on Jan. 28, agents found another group, playing war games at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The teens violated the city's curfew law, which prohibits youngsters under 18 
from being outside unsupervised by adults from 10 p.m. to dawn unless 
participating in school-related functions. But, on each occasion, police 
released the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's just kids playing out a game that many adults enjoy -- it's their 
version of tactical maneuvers," said Lt. Bill Brown, second-in-command at 
Southern Command, which patrols the area. "It's never caused anyone harm." 
</P>
<P>
But, on a recent Saturday afternoon, one Imperial Beach resident said he was 
frightened when he came across three youths toting play guns, wearing 
camouflage outfits and face paint. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Schnorr, an instructor at Southwestern College, said one youth whirled 
and pointed a pistol at him. When he yelled at the boys, they ran into the 
bushes. Schnorr said teen-agers have played war in the area for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Fox Television Stations is scheduled to air a report on border 
violence, concentrating on "secret para-military groups," according to a press 
release. The network's "The Reporters" show alleges that "Rambo-like" gangs 
shoot and harass undocumented workers. In the program, a number of youths are 
seen rounding up Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister and others, however, say the "Reporters" crew asked them to rough 
up Mexicans and their group members do not shoot or bother undocumented 
workers. They say some groups, not theirs, do harass Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't touch illegal aliens," said MacAllister, who has played war for two 
years in the border area. "We tell them it's dangerous and they should leave. 
Maybe we give them a drink of water if they ask for it. Sometimes, they scare 
us, they pop out of nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Stone, executive producer of "The Reporters," says he stands behind the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We are quite disturbed by any claim that we sensationalize what happens. From 
the footage, it's quite clear they (the teen-agers) were using procedures that 
they used a number of times before. We are fairly well-trained to separate fact 
from fiction, and it's clear to us that the footage is realistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and INS officials say they don't believe the teen-agers are harassing 
Mexicans who attempt to cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone is taking vigilante action, the San Diego Police Department would 
not tolerate it and would do everything it could to stop it," Brown said. 
"There have never been any reports of camouflaged youths accosting illegal 
aliens or that there were any vigilante actions." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Bates, Cozart of the INS said: "The Border Patrol has not 
received any reports of individuals playing 'war games' who were using force to 
approach undocumented persons." 
</P>
<P>
The 28 members of Metal Militia usually meet every Saturday night. The boys, 
ranging from 13 to 21 years old, divide themselves up into teams and take off 
into the underbrush. Some are recruits, others, have played the game for years. 
Eddie Smith, 18, said he has played war games for five years. 
</P>
<P>
The boys have different reasons for joining. Rodrigo Vazcones is a 15-year-old 
ninth-grader from Mar Vista. Vazcones, who has been involved with the group for 
three months, said that he likes the thrill of "going into the war zone" and 
that it helps him avoid doing chores at home. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the others, like David, want to join the military when they get 
older. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting us ready for our future," said David, who hopes to become a 
Marine. The group learns how to read a map, build shelters and find food, such 
as insects, said David, who added that he had never actually eaten any bugs. 
</P>
<P>
However, Senior Chief Petty Officer Bob Howard, a Navy spokesman, said: "I 
guess they are in some way preparing themselves for conflicts that would have 
occurred 60 years ago, but we don't have a whole lot of call in the service 
these days for those skills. I'd much rather have a kid who stayed home and did 
his homework."

EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Wilmington residents are gearing up to fight a proposed expansion of an auto 
salvage yard, saying they want to reverse the community's longstanding 
reputation as the junkyard and heavy-industry capital of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As an amendment to the area's community plan -- still to be approved by the Los 
Angeles City Council -- the proposal would increase by half the size of Ecology 
Auto Wrecking at 1710 Eubank Ave.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POOL OF 5 CLAIMS LAST SHARE OF LOTTO 
JACKPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Carpenter of Long Beach came forward Friday to claim the last share of 
Wednesday's record $68.56-million Lotto jackpot, state lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who represents a group of five people who pooled their money to buy 
tickets, said, "It sure beats Social Security." 
</P>
<P>
Two other Southern California winners -- Joan Young of Laguna Niguel and Lydia 
Neufeld of Simi Valley -- joined Carpenter at a news conference Friday. Young, 
who moved to Southern California a year and half ago with her family, said they 
plan to travel. Neufeld said she wants to build a Pentecostal church for her 
pastor, and her husband, Dave, a building contractor who is concerned about the 
environment, wants to support the Coalition Against Gill Net Fishing off the 
Southern California coast.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CBS EMPLOYEE ARRESTED IN COCAINE 
INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to a request for an investigation, Los Angeles police went 
undercover for three weeks at CBS Television City in the Fairfax District and 
arrested an employee on suspicion of selling cocaine, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas George Krueger, 33, of Van Nuys, was arrested after allegedly selling 
cocaine to an investigator in a network parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
CBS had reported suspicions of drug sales on company property and assisted in 
the investigation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
CBS issued a statement condemning the use of drugs and vowing to fire drug 
users. A spokesman refused to confirm reports by CBS sources, who asked to 
remain anonymous, that more than 30 behind-the-camera employees were being 
interviewed and that some have been suspended for two weeks with pay.

2 L.A. MEN CHARGED AFTER GUN BATTLE WITH SECRET SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TWO UNDERCOVER AGENTS ARE WOUNDED DURING ATTEMPT TO BUY COUNTERFEIT 
BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two Los Angeles men arrested in connection with a shoot-out that left two U.S. 
Secret Service agents wounded during an attempted undercover buy of $485,000 in 
fake $50 bills were booked Friday on suspicion of attempted murder of a police 
officer -- a state crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Because federal officers were involved, the shooting would normally be handled 
as a federal case. However, the men were being held on the state charge at the 
request of federal authorities, who want more time to prepare their own case, 
said Richard Griffin, Secret Service agent-in-charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the luxury of time to put together whatever federal charges need to be 
brought," Griffin said. "These people are not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities declined to be specific about what charges they are looking 
at, although counterfeiting U.S. currency and attempted murder of a federal 
officer are two charges that could be filed as early as next week, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Padilla, 44, who was shot and critically wounded in the incident 
Thursday night at a four-unit apartment complex in the unincorporated Florence 
district, and Oliveros Orosco, 26, were being held without bail pending further 
investigation, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the two federal agents wounded in the incident, identified only as a 
37-year-old male, sustained a bullet wound in the foot and was being treated at 
Brea Community Hospital, a spokeswoman for the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
The other agent, identified as a 30-year-old woman, was treated and released 
for a graze wound in the leg at County-USC Medical Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting broke out shortly after another Secret Service agent -- who was 
trying to negotiate a "buy" of "poor quality" counterfeit money for about 8 
cents to 10 cents on the dollar -- decided to end the discussion and arrest the 
men, both of whom were armed, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
"An altercation ensued," Griffin said. "There was some grappling with a suspect 
who tried to flee. It progressed from there." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla came out of the apartment in the 6900 block of South Compton Avenue and 
fired one round from a handgun at backup Secret Service agents and sheriff's 
deputies who were waiting outside, said Patrick Hunter of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. The other officers returned fire with handguns and 
at least one shotgun, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two injured agents, who were wearing protective flak jackets, were among 
those waiting outside the building, according to Sheriff's Sgt. Craig Boyett. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the federal agents were shot by the suspects or by 
backup officers, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we are not in a position to discuss that because some of the 
people involved in this have not been interviewed because of their injuries," 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he added, "when you are dealing with a shotgun it is hard to say 
where every single pellet wound up." 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who was shot in the arm, hip and leg, was taken to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center where he was listed in critical but stable condition 
after undergoing surgery Friday morning, Boyett said. 
</P>
<P>
Orosco, who was not injured in the incident, dropped his handgun as officers 
entered the apartment to arrest him, Boyett said. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service's office in Los Angeles has been the "busiest in the nation" 
in terms of counterfeit money seized during the last two years, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the most recent fiscal year, there was $17 million worth of counterfeit 
currency seized in the Los Angeles area," Griffin said. "That reflects 25% of 
the total counterfeit currency seizures nationwide."

4 FILIPINOS INDICTED ON GUN-SMUGGLING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Philippine vice governor and three other Filipinos were indicted by a 
federal grand jury Friday on firearms and customs violations in connection with 
an alleged attempt to smuggle more than 300 weapons and 500,000 rounds of 
ammunition into the Philippines, acting U.S. Atty. Robert Brosio announced. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges Antonio Paredes, 65, now of Long Beach; his son, Quintin 
Paredes III, 42; Maria Louisa Tan Hang, 34, and her husband, Kerwin Hang, 42, 
with attempting to smuggle the handguns and pistol primers to unnamed 
co-conspirators in the Cagayan province of the Philippines. In recent months 
that area has been the site of considerable anti-government activity. Quintin 
Paredes, Maria Hang and her husband are residents of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Paredes is free on $250,000 bail. The younger Paredes and Maria Hang 
are being held in Los Angeles without bail. Kerwin Hang has not had a bail 
hearing yet, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, the defendants paid a local gun dealer more than 
$50,000 cash for the firearms. 
</P>
<P>
The case was jointly investigated by the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Bureau agents became curious when they noticed 
the gun dealer, whose name is being withheld, making heavy purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam, who is prosecuting the case, declined to 
provide details beyond the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
But Gillam said Antonio Paredes is a retired judge and former vice governor 
from the Philippines, and his father also held prominent political positions 
under the late Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Gillam said that 
Quintin Paredes III is a lawyer practicing in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Maria and Kerwin Hang, both Manila-area residents, 
were the financiers of the smuggling operation. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 8, authorities intercepted an arms shipment -- containing 371 pistols 
and 500,000 rounds of ammunition -- that apparently was destined for a cargo 
container that was to be placed aboard a ship heading for the Philippines, 
Gillam said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment states that Quintin Paredes III placed the first order for 
weapons with a local gun dealer, who is now cooperating with the government in 
the case. Paredes subsequently placed several other orders until the plot was 
discovered, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach lawyers for the defendants were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment 
and a possible fine of $1 million on the customs violation, and five years each 
on the five firearms counts. The maximum fine on the firearms charge is 
$250,000 per count.

VARSITY LEARNERS; 
</P>
<P>
ACADEMICS: LETTERS, TRADITIONALLY RESERVED FOR ATHLETES, WILL NOW BE GIVEN TO 
OUTSTANDING STUDENTS AT SAUGUS HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike von Buelow remembers slaving for good grades in high school and being 
annoyed that there was little recognition for academic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
"You put so much time and effort and you set your priorities for academics and 
you work and work and nobody notices," said von Buelow, now principal of Saugus 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
So starting this spring, his remedy is to reward Saugus High students with 
varsity letters, not for whacking balls out of the park or slam-dunking 
basketballs but for winning top grades. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to let them know that achieving academically gives them a much 
better chance of being successful than excelling only in extracurricular 
activities," said von Buelow, who worked on the idea for more than a year with 
faculty and parents. "We wanted to come up with something to tell the students 
that we and the parents are very proud of their academic performances." 
</P>
<P>
Susie Lange, press secretary for state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, 
said few schools award academic letters, but the idea "is something we 
applaud." 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly our society has been sending students mixed messages," Lange said. 
"You're supposed to do well in school, but everybody who does well is made fun 
of -- the smart student is a nerd -- and athletes get all the attention." 
</P>
<P>
Saugus students will qualify for scholastic letters by making a 3.6 grade point 
average -- an A-minus average -- or by participating in academically oriented 
competitions for at least two semesters. Similar to those awarded to athletes, 
the block-style letter "S" will be light blue, bearing a symbolic torch of 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the 2,000 students are expected to get academic letters this 
spring, after filling out applications for them, he said. He expects about 150 
to qualify, but some will miss the deadline and "some will be a little too shy" 
to apply, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Ronnie Mimran, an athlete whose grades qualify him for a letter, said he 
favors the idea because students who do not excel in sports due to handicaps 
will be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Students with good grades sometimes get rewards, usually scholarships, he said, 
but scholastic letters will reinforce the importance of learning. "It's a way 
of getting your priorities straight." 
</P>
<P>
A few schools, such as nearby Canyon High School, also give their top students 
letters, school jackets, medallions or pins. Saugus' letters will be given out 
each semester. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone on the faculty is happy with the idea. "If we started giving 
letters for people in academics, before you know it, the importance of athletic 
letters will be diminished," said the school's head basketball coach, John 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an advocate of academic work, and we really stress academics with our 
basketball players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he is not totally against rewarding academic achievers with letters, 
but "there are other ways to recognize academic success. The letter is a 
traditional athletic kind of reward, and it's been around for 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Forsyth, a consultant at the state Department of Education, said some 
educators criticize rewarding academic achievers as "elitist." She finds that 
laughable, she said, when schools interrupt class so students can witness 
athletic award ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hot issue, this business of rewarding kids who have extraordinary 
production in academic and creative areas," she said, but letters provide "a 
legitimate, institutionalized recognition to yet another area of excellence" in 
addition to athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Buelow said students told him that they would study harder for letters and hope 
that this, combined with other programs, will be an incentive for B students to 
push for higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
But one 11th-grader said she is not excited about letter recognitions. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean anything, it's nothing big," said C student Mariza Scoglio. 
</P>
<P>
She expects the same reaction from her friends and said that only "the people 
who get good grades" will like the program.

CONTEMPT FINDING SOUGHT ON SILBERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Businessman Richard T. Silberman, recovering from a suicide attempt, should be 
held in contempt of court for failing to sign papers allowing government 
investigators access to foreign bank account records, federal prosecutors said 
in legal papers filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they have been trying for months to get Silberman to sign a 
form allowing investigators to search those accounts and had been told by 
defense lawyers that Silberman would allow access to Swiss accounts. However, 
Silberman still hasn't signed any forms and should either do so immediately or 
be held in contempt, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors want to search the records, in part, to try to trace government 
funds that they claim Silberman, reputed mobster Chris Petti and three other 
men laundered through a complex series of fund transfers involving a number of 
companies in different countries. 
</P>
<P>
The five men are accused of laundering $300,000 given them by an undercover FBI 
agent who allegedly had told them it was the proceeds of Colombian drug 
dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman abruptly vanished last week from San Diego and was found two days 
later in a Las Vegas hotel room, unconscious. After leaving a suicide note, he 
tried to kill himself with an overdose of sleeping pills, his wife, San Diego 
County Supervisor Susan Golding, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman disappeared about two months before his April 10 trial date on the 
money-laundering charges. Immediately after being released Monday from a Las 
Vegas hospital, he checked himself into the Langley Porter Psychiatric 
Institute, a UC San Francisco hospital noted nationally for its psychiatric 
treatment, where he remains. 
</P>
<P>
No information on his condition is available from hospital officials, who say 
state law forbids them from discussing patients. 
</P>
<P>
In the legal brief they filed Friday, prosecutors did not disclose the number 
or location of Silberman's foreign accounts or explain whether they were held 
by him or merely for him. U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, who is 
presiding over the case, set a hearing on the request for next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, prosecutors filed papers asking Irving to revoke Silberman's 
$500,000 bail, contending that his trip to Las Vegas suggests he is a flight 
risk. A hearing on that request also is set for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's defense lawyers also filed legal papers Friday responding to 
prosecutors' request to revoke bail. The papers were not available, however, 
because they were delivered under a special procedure at the downtown San Diego 
federal courthouse permitting filings after the clerk's office closes to the 
public but before the clerks actually leave.

TRANSFER OF JAPAN-BOUND CARRIER TO DRAIN MILLIONS FROM ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: WITH MORE THAN $100 MILLION A YEAR IN CONTRACTS, SERVICES AND 
SALARIES AT STAKE, LOCAL OFFICIALS REGRET LOSS OF INDEPENDENCE. 
</P>

<P>
San Diego will lose more than $100 million in Navy contracts, services and 
payroll when the aircraft carrier Independence departs for Japan in 1991, Navy 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The move, meant to reassure Japan that it remains the linchpin of the U.S. 
Pacific defense, has surprised few but shaken many. And, for the first time in 
more than 20 years, San Diego will have only one aircraft carrier, the Ranger, 
based here. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact on the community is not only ship repair companies but other 
businesses, and it's going to have a heck of an impact," said David Bain, 
president of Pacific Ship Repair and Fabrications. "We are all going to be 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Japanese officials this week that the 
Independence would replace the World War II-era carrier Midway. The 
Independence will take to Yokosuka its 2,836 officers and crew, as well as 
three squadrons with 530 pilots and crew, said Senior Chief Petty Officer Bob 
Howard, spokesman for the Naval Air Force U.S. Pacific Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Although the move has long been expected, some congressmen said they will fight 
to bring another carrier to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important not only to the San Diego community, which has always 
supported the Navy, but to our Navy presence in the Pacific that the Navy 
commit one of the new carriers . . . to San Diego," said Rep. Duncan Hunter 
(R-San Diego) in a letter sent Friday to Secretary of the Navy Lawrence 
Garrett. "It is essential that a strong carrier presence be maintained in San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Confirmation of the Independence's new assignment comes only 10 days after the 
departure of the aircraft carrier Constellation, which will undergo a 29-month 
overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. The Constellation is scheduled to 
return in 1993, once its $750-million refurbishment is completed. 
</P>
<P>
But, in recent years, San Diego has been home to three carriers: Constellation, 
Independence and the Ranger. And the eight San Diego shipyards, which have 
divvied up about $25 million in repairs for each carrier annually, will now 
start to scramble, Pacific Ship's Bain said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we only have one carrier sitting here, and there are other reductions in 
the defense budget, you aren't going to have eight shipyards in San Diego -- 
not that I'll be one of the ones leaving," Bain said. 
</P>
<P>
Bain, like officials at other ship repair companies, has tried to diversify his 
business to include more work on other types of ships. In 1989, aircraft 
carrier repairs made up 75% of Bain's business, including about $8 million in 
repairs to the Independence. This year, he expects 40% of his business to be 
devoted to carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The Midway, scheduled to be retired in 1991, will be decommissioned in San 
Diego after its trip from Japan, Howard said. The carrier will remain overseas 
until the Independence arrives. It is not known whether the carrier will be 
sold or turned into scrap metal. 
</P>
<P>
The Independence's presence in Japan means a significant upgrading of military 
power because the carrier is host to the F-14 Tomcat -- a high-performance 
fighter jet that the Midway could not accommodate, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Independence's salaries, repair and supply contracts add up to $104 million 
a year, Howard said. "That's a $100-million decision to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
But some predict that another carrier will soon call the city its home, easing 
the sting of the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very optimistic. I have no doubt in my mind that, by the time the 
Independence goes, we will have a ship named to replace it -- if not already," 
said Pete Litrenta, vice president of military affairs with the San Diego 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Others said that the loss is not nearly as great as it might have been in a 
time of military budget cuts and proposed base closures. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry to see us lose the economic benefits of the Independence, but, on 
balance, with base closings and other military consolidations, I think San 
Diego won't lose," said Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego). "While I regret its 
leaving, I think we are still strong."

KIDNAP-ROBBERY IN PALMDALE FOILED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: GUNMEN HELD A SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSISTANT MANAGER AND HER HUSBAND CAPTIVE 
FOR 24 HOURS BEFORE TRYING TO ROB THE S&amp;L.

Two gunmen held the assistant manager of a savings and loan and her husband 
captive in their Palmdale home for more than a day, then forced the woman to go 
to her office in a robbery attempt that was foiled by a silent alarm, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, responding to the alarm, rescued Denise 
Adkins, 24, at Southern California Savings in Newhall early Friday and arrested 
Brian Keith Sims, 29, of Duarte, after a short chase, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Another man -- identified as Tyrone McCraw, 29, of the Pomona area -- escaped 
by commandeering a car at gunpoint and remained at large Friday night, an FBI 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers did not harm Adkins or her husband, Dennis, during the 36-hour 
ordeal in the house in the 5300 block of East Avenue R-11 in Palmdale, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very traumatic experience, but they were not physically abused," said 
Michael Iracondo, Denise Adkins' father. Iracondo accompanied his daughter to a 
neighbor's home to be reunited with her husband Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they were terrified to learn that the couple had been held 
captive without anyone's knowledge in the house on the quiet cul-de-sac in a 
new subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, the incident began Wednesday evening when Denise 
Adkins returned home from work and was confronted by two masked men, one armed 
with a pistol. The men, who had broken into the house earlier, also armed 
themselves with a shotgun they found in the residence. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins' husband, a Los Angeles city firefighter, was working an overnight 
shift. 
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday morning, the gunmen forced Denise Adkins to call her husband and 
ask him to come home on the pretext that she was suffering severe back pains, 
according to authorities and neighbors. The robbers bound Dennis Adkins when he 
arrived, then held the couple captive in the house for the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"He said they treated them fairly decently," said Billy Pricer, a Sheriff's 
Department chaplain who comforted Dennis Adkins. "They gave him water and food, 
they let him smoke a cigarette and go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
The robbers left Dennis Adkins bound in a bathroom early Friday morning and 
took his wife to the Southern California Savings branch office. 
</P>
<P>
About 5:30 a.m., the robbers forced Denise Adkins to open the savings office 
and told her to remove money from the vault. But she could not open the vault 
because the time lock would not unlock until shortly before 9 a.m., said John 
Doyle, a spokesman for the savings office. 
</P>
<P>
An alarm sounded at the Santa Clarita office of the Sheriff's Department about 
5:45 a.m. FBI spokesman Jim Neilson would not say whether Adkins triggered the 
silent alarm intentionally or whether it went off automatically.

said. Another man -- identified as Tyrone McCraw, 29, of the Pomona area -- 
escaped by commandeering a car at gunpoint, FBI spokesman Jim Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Neilson described McCraw as black, 5 feet, 8 inches tall and about 125 pounds. 
He was last seen wearing a hooded dark sweater and driving a 1989 Toyota 
Corolla. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers did not harm Adkins and her husband, Dennis, during the 36-hour 
ordeal in the house in the 5300 block of East Avenue R-11 in Palmdale, 
authorities said.

Neighbors said they were terrified to learn that the couple had been held 
captive without anyone's knowledge in the house on the quiet cul-de-sac in a 
new subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
"Little did we know what was going on next door," said Rachel Taylor, a 
neighbor who was awakened by a distraught Dennis Adkins pounding on her door. 
Adkins, bound for most of his captivity, managed to untie himself after the 
kidnapers left for the savings and loan office with his wife early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Dennis Adkins called sheriff's deputies. But by the time their 
report was received, other deputies were already responding to the alarm at the 
savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's ordeal began Wednesday evening when Denise Adkins returned home 
from work and was confronted by two men, one armed with a pistol, who had 
broken into the house, authorities said. The men had also armed themselves with 
a shotgun they found in the residence. 
</P>
<P>

according to authorities and neighbors. The robbers, who wore masks, bound 
Dennis Adkins when he arrived, then held the couple captive in the house for

</P>
<P>
"He said they treated them fairly decently," said Billy Pricer, a Sheriff's 
Department chaplain who comforted Dennis Adkins. "They gave him water and food, 
they let him smoke a cigarette and go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
The robbers left Dennis Adkins bound in a bathroom early Friday morning and 
took his wife to the Southern California Savings branch office in the 26400 
block of Sierra Highway in Newhall, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Adkins was warned that his wife would be harmed if he attempted to free 
himself, Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
About 5:30 a.m., the robbers forced Denise Adkins to open the savings office 
and told her to remove money from the vault. But she was unable to open it 
because a time lock was set to remain on until shortly before the office opens 
at 9 a.m., said John Doyle, a spokesman for Southern California Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle said the robbers forced Adkins to turn off one alarm, but she triggered a 
second alarm when she complied with their instructions to try to open the 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
The alarm sounded at the Santa Clarita sheriff's station about 5:45 a.m., 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Neilson nor Doyle would say whether Adkins triggered the silent alarm 
intentionally or it went off automatically, citing security considerations. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrived at the savings and loan shortly afterward to rescue Denise 
Adkins and arrest Simms. 
</P>
<P>
McCraw fled on foot, then stole a car from an unidentified driver at gunpoint 
near the savings branch and escaped, Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Sgt. Gunars Heine said detectives are trying to determine whether the 
suspects had watched the couple in the days before the kidnaping and why they 
singled out Adkins for the robbery attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said they did not notice any suspicious activity, although Taylor 
said she had thought it strange that the couple's trash cans remained outside 
on Thursday and that the husband's car was in the driveway during a time when 
he normally was at work. 
</P>
<P>
Iracondo said his daughter and son-in-law bought their house in Palmdale two 
years ago partly because they believed the area was more tranquil and had less 
crime than the San Fernando Valley, where they had previously lived. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt a lot safer out here," he said.

OTHER CITIES REV UP ANTI-MALATHION EFFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A day after the city of Pasadena launched a novel scheme to use police 
helicopters to shadow and ticket the state's squadron of malathion-spraying 
choppers, several more Southern California cities moved Friday toward launching 
their own aerial wars against the state. 
</P>
<P>
The political battle over malathion also heated up Friday in the state 
Legislature as Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) unveiled a proposal that 
would seek an end to funding of the program and make the state more liable for 
lawsuits arising from the Medfly eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell introduced a measure 
similar to the Pasadena ordinance that bans low-flying aircraft over the city. 
The Los Angeles City Council voted 9 to 3 to hear the measure, but because it 
fell a vote short of the 10 votes required for emergency consideration, the 
motion was sent to a council committee. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa city officials also vowed Friday to implement a similar ordinance just a 
day after they followed Pasadena's lead and voted to approve their own ban on 
low-flying helicopters. "We're not sure whether it will do the job," Azusa City 
Councilman Tony Naranjo said, "but it will grab somebody's attention." 
</P>
<P>
And city officials in Monterey Park, San Gabriel and South Pasadena also said 
Friday that they are discussing or scheduling to act on similar ordinances over 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a clear indication of the concern that is shared by all these 
public officials," Pasadena City Director William Paparian said. "It is 
gratifying to see other public officials step forward and take action." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena ordinance aims to stop aerial malathion spraying by banning 
formation-flying by aircraft under the altitude of 700 feet. On Thursday, that 
measure had its first test as a Pasadena police helicopter followed state 
pilots, warning them that they were violating the new law and could face a 
penalty of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The state has attacked the ordinance, saying the city has no authority to 
regulate air traffic. Pasadena officials responded that they have the right to 
stop the helicopters because of the potential hazard of a mid-air collision and 
the effects of the pesticide on residents. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Roos joined local efforts to curb malathion spraying by announcing 
that he will introduce legislation Monday that would remove a one-year statute 
of limitations, making the state liable for any future injuries or illnesses 
caused by malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Roos said no one has ever sued the state on those grounds, but added that his 
measure will ensure that the option remains open if spraying eventually proves 
to have long-term health effects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's going to be easy," Roos said, "but if the governor says 
there is no danger, let's remove the one-year limitation." 
</P>
<P>
Roos, the Assembly Speaker pro tempore, said he has also asked a joint 
Senate-Assembly committee in charge of approving funds for spraying to "turn 
off the spigot" until a public hearing is held on the aerial eradication 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp also announced Friday that his office 
is launching an investigation into whether malathion sold in stores should be 
regulated under the restrictions of the state's Proposition 65. The proposition 
imposes strict notification and discharge requirements on the release of toxic 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, whose office has been defending the state in lawsuits aimed at 
stopping malathion spraying, said his investigation will focus on potentially 
dangerous impurities, such as arsenic, cadmium and lead, that are found in some 
brands of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The state released test results Wednesday showing that no chemicals regulated 
by Proposition 65 have been found in the malathion used by the state in aerial 
spraying. Van de Kamp said he has asked for a re-evaluation of those test 
results by an independent body. 
</P>
<P>
Planning to announce his candidacy for governor this weekend, Van de Kamp said 
even if regulated chemicals are found in the malathion the state is using, his 
office will not be able to stop the spraying over urban areas because state 
agencies are exempt from the restrictions of Proposition 65.

COURT ORDERS OWNERS TO HALT DRUG DEALING IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court order was issued Friday to force owners of a row of battered and 
overcrowded apartment buildings in Atwater to immediately halt drug trafficking 
in the buildings and to clean up the rundown area. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn obtained the order after Los Angeles police made more 
than 140 arrests for drug-related crimes during a six-month investigation last 
year at three apartment buildings in the 3400 block of Drew Street. 
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, the city attorney's office has been working with the 
Police Department to enforce the state's Controlled Substances Act, a law that 
went into effect in 1971 but previously had been little used. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows the city attorney, district attorney or a private citizen to 
file civil action against anyone with a legal interest in a property 
consistently used for selling, storing, giving away or manufacturing controlled 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
Police Officer Efrain Baeza, who led the abatement investigation, said the 
neighborhood "is known throughout the area and Los Angeles" as a place to buy 
PCP, cocaine and other narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
"There's heavy drug dealing, constant drug dealing. It's one of the worst," 
Baeza said. 
</P>
<P>
The area also is plagued with gang problems related to narcotics activities, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The court order -- a preliminary injunction issued by Los Angeles Superior 
Court Judge David P. Yaffe -- requires owners to evict tenants arrested for 
drug-related activities, to hire private guards to patrol the premises and to 
install lighting, fences, security gates and take other measures to discourage 
trafficking and to assist police. The order also requires landscaping and other 
physical cleanup measures. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said the drug dealing at the three buildings at 3401 1/2 to 3411 Drew St. 
"has been creating a major problem for the entire Atwater area for over a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Special abatement teams have investigated several other drug-trafficking 
locations in the Northeast Police Division area, but landlords in those cases 
have since corrected the problems without court action, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the Drew Street apartments have refused to cooperate, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to comply with the court order, a civil action, could result in stiff 
penalties against the owners and possible closure of the apartment buildings 
for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The injunction stemmed from abatement lawsuits filed by the district attorney 
Oct. 6 under the California Controlled Substances Abatement Act. 
</P>
<P>
Defendants in the suit are Yuri D. Shane and Claudia Lee Shane of Fountain 
Valley, Dean Winston Monroe and Vane Eugenia Monroe of Huntington Beach and 
Riven and Polina Polyakov and Ilya Polyakov of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Shanes and the Monroes could not be contacted. Riven Polyakov refused to 
comment.

CITY, DEVELOPER SEEK $5.5-MILLION LOAN FOR MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's Community Redevelopment Agency and developer Alexander Haagen are 
negotiating a deal that could provide a loan of up to $5.5 million for 
improvements to the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza to entice stores to locate 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The agency and the Alexander Haagen Co., joint developers of the 
800,000-square-foot mall, opened talks this month in an effort to attract shoe 
stores, card and gift shops, sporting goods outlets and women's clothing 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
The mall is the first regional shopping center in the nation to be built in a 
predominantly black community. It opened more than a year ago amid much 
celebration from the residents of the largely middle- and upper-middle-class 
communities of Baldwin Hills, View Park, Crenshaw and Leimert Park.

ASSEMBLYWOMAN WILL PAY $13,200 FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) has agreed to pay a $13,200 fine 
for double-billing both the state treasury and her campaign fund for 
legislative trips, as well as using political donations to pay for fashion and 
beauty treatments for her staff, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The fine, which Mojonnier must pay to the state out of her personal account, is 
"a substantial amount of money" and one of the largest extracted from an 
officeholder for misusing campaign funds, said Alan Ashby, an attorney 
general's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The largest was levied against Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), who agreed in 
December to pay $21,075 for using campaign funds for personal travel and such 
personal expenses as a graduation party. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the stiff penalty -- double the $6,618 in travel money involved -- 
Mojonnier said Friday she was "delighted" with the outcome of the attorney 
general's probe. She said the investigation showed that the financial 
irregularities were a result of inadvertent bookkeeping errors. 
</P>
<P>
"The attorney general found that nothing was done intentionally (but) that 
there were errors made," Mojonnier said. 
</P>
<P>
But the two-page agreement released by the attorney general's office Friday 
makes no mention of Mojonnier's intentions except to say that the Republican 
lawmaker signed the settlement without admitting wrong-doing. 
</P>
<P>
Ashby, in a telephone interview, told The Times: "If you spent money on travel, 
reimburse yourself from your campaign fund and then the state reimburses you 
for the same travel and you pocket the money, I find it difficult to believe 
that any intelligent person in our society would not perceive that as wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The terms of the settlement between Mojonnier and the attorney general bar the 
state from pressing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's office initiated the investigation after newspaper 
stories last summer reported the apparent double-dipping on trips and the use 
of $845 in political funds on beauty and fashion services for five female 
employees of Mojonnier's San Diego district office. The services consisted of 
individual sessions with a fashion consultant and make-over treatment at a 
beauty parlor. 
</P>
<P>
The northern San Diego County lawmaker -- a member of the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee, a powerful panel that helps shape the state budget -- said she 
overlooked the double-billings for a variety of reasons, including the fact 
that she was switching accountants last year. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor, she said, was her divorce, which has yet to be finalized. "My 
husband had been handling all the personal affairs when I was in office, and 
because of the divorce situation, that no longer occurred," she said.

POWER OUTAGE SNARLS SUNSET STRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A power outage caused a major blackout in the Sunset Strip area of West 
Hollywood on Friday night, cutting electricity to nightclubs and causing a 
major traffic jam on Sunset and Santa Monica boulevards, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Traffic has just come to an absolute standstill and it's giving us fits," said 
Sgt. Gaylord Cox, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
An explosion in an underground vault may have caused the 8:45 p.m. outage, said 
Melanie Savage, a Southern California Edison Co. spokeswoman. She said that 
about 550 customers in the area lost electricity. 
</P>
<P>
"We put candles on the tables and dangled flashlights from overhead lighting 
fixtures," said Barbara Lazaroff, co-owner of Spago restaurant.

CELTICS LET TRADE DEADLINE PASS DESPITE ROAD TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER MAY, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There were the usual temptations. There were countless conversations. 
</P>
<P>
But after spending the day on the phone -- the telephone companies must love 
this day better than Mother's Day -- Boston Celtics General Manager Jan Volk 
emerged from his Boston bunker to report the team you have been seeing all 
season will be the one you will be seeing the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
There were a couple of minor deals as the National Basketball Assoication's 
trading deadline came and went Thursday. There was the blockbuster featuring a 
Teutonic tradeoff involving Chris Welp and Uwe Blab. 
</P>
<P>
Another involved Winston Garland, a point guard the Celtics could have had if 
they wanted him. They did not want to pay the price, so Garland went to the Los 
Angeles Clippers for two second-round picks. The Golden State Warriors gladly 
would have taken Ed Pinckney. 
</P>
<P>
One source said the Celtics and the Charlotte Hornets were talking about Reggie 
Lewis and Dell Curry -- not in the same deal -- but nothing came of that. 
Boston had a known interest in Rex Chapman and also called about Vernon 
Maxwell, who the San Antonio Spurs sold to the Houston Rockets Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure would have liked to have known about his availability," Boston Coach 
Jimmy Rodgers said of Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
But Volk had said he would not make a trade simply to make a trade and he was 
true to his word, despite the team's generally uninspiring play of late. They 
have lost four in a row, three via blowout. 
</P>
<P>
"We explored every possibility with the hope of improving our team," Volk said. 
"But we weren't going to make a deal just to stir things up. We had a lot of 
conversations that provoked further conversations, but nothing which caused us 
to make a deal." 
</P>
<P>
The deadline passed as the team spent the day in the Bay Area. The night 
before, the Celtics had been bushwhacked by the Utah Jazz, 116-103. And that 
defeat had come 24 hours after another pounding by the Phoenix Suns, 120-99. 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret the Celtics need something. They are old and slow up front, 
although still devastating at times. Their guard play has hit all notes on the 
scale, bottoming out in Utah when Dennis Johnson went zero for five and Reggie 
Lewis scored six points, his lowest output since Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But help did not come via trade, which neither surprised nor disappointed 
Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have any expectations," Rodgers said. "When you think that a number 
of things may happen and they don't, then you're going to be disappointed. But 
I never thought anything was up. So we just move on and go about our business." 
</P>
<P>
And now, business has not been booming. After the Utah debacle -- it was not a 
13-point game by any stretch of the imagination -- a visibly distressed Kevin 
McHale addressed the team's many inadequacies. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have more margin for error than we do now," he said. "We're a 
very fragile team. If we're out of sync, it's a disaster. We've got to have 
more room for error than we give ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be going zoom, zoom but instead it's clunk, clunk, clunk. It's 
almost like teams can pick and choose what they want to take away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Last year at this time, McHale was open and candid about the team's need for 
help. He suggested Derek Smith. Walter Berry. LaSalle Thompson. Anyone. 
</P>
<P>
This year, when asked if he felt that way again, McHale said, "I don't think it 
makes any difference how we feel." 
</P>
<P>
McHale admitted the Los Angeles Lakers' game last Sunday took a lot out of him 
and, perhaps, the team. The Celtics played an excellent game and still lost. 
</P>
<P>
"And we haven't done much since then, so maybe it took a lot out of us," he 
said. "It's just really frustrating trying to get this thing going. It's awful 
tough."

KING FIGHTING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF DOUGLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In boxing parlance, Don King is fighting off the ropes. He's been in the 
position before but worked himself out of it. This time, he's battling to 
regain control of James "Buster" Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
King has lost his opportunity -- at least for the time being -- to promote a 
Douglas-Mike Tyson rematch and gone to court to try to win back Douglas's 
services and block Las Vegas hotel magnate Steve Wynn from putting on a 
Douglas-Evander Holyfield heavyweight title fight. 
</P>
<P>
A man of many words, King summed up his situation Friday succinctly. The 
self-proclaimed "man of the hour in the news" is "beleaguered." 
</P>
<P>
He gave the keynote address at Howard University's fifth annual Salute to 
Blacks in Business Conference, sketching the history of racism in America and 
urging black students to study diligently to prepare themselves to face a 
"racist society." 
</P>
<P>
During the speech, he referred to Douglas's upset of Tyson in Tokyo and his own 
futile efforts so far to promote a rematch. He cited his "vilification" for 
protesting the "long count" that Douglas was given before he knocked out Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
King criticized Mirage Hotel owner Wynn for signing Douglas to a "conditional 
contract," although he did not mention Wynn by name until a news conference 
after the speech. The Mirage, and Douglas, filed suit earlier this week to 
determine whether King has a valid promotional contract with Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
King contends he is Douglas's promoter "whether he knows it or not," and 
indicated his best chance to regain control of Douglas is through his 
breach-of-contract suit against Douglas, filed Thursday. "I believe in 
America," King said. 
</P>
<P>
While Tyson's estranged manager Bill Cayton and former trainer Kevin Rooney 
have criticized King for his handling of Tyson, King sees his role as Tyson's 
friend, promoter and de facto manager as just the opposite. "Every fighter I've 
ever had anything to do with," King said, "they've all gotten an opportunity to 
gain fame, acclaim and affluence." 
</P>
<P>
In his attempt to promote Douglas's next fight, King told the audience that he 
met recently with "a top fight executive" who told him "the day of you, Don 
King, is like a dinosaur -- it's extinct. ... " 
</P>
<P>
"Since I didn't acquiesce to his intimidation," King added, "he sued me." 
</P>
<P>
Later King said, "What's happening here, as the guy told me, Steve Wynn, it's 
only business." 
</P>
<P>
Wynn clearly wants to get into the heavyweight business in a big way, 
reportedly offering Douglas $25 million to fight Holyfield and if successful 
another $35 million to fight Tyson. Said King's rival promoter Bob Arum: 
"Douglas asked for big figures. And Wynn said yes." 
</P>
<P>
King and Arum appeared to agree on one thing: It was a staggering offer. 
</P>
<P>
As Douglas tries to rid himself of King legally and rake in the jackpot Wynn 
has offered him, King charges that Douglas is turning his back on him. 
</P>
<P>
"All the years I've taken care of this guy," King said. "I still had the faith 
to keep putting him in. Not once, but twice. I got him two world title fights. 
One was Tony Tucker in 1987, one in 1990 ... nine years of total subsidization 
... stayed with him all this time ... after all the money, time and effort I've 
invested, and love, and helping him when many would have discarded him. ... " 
</P>
<P>
King also claimed Douglas's manager, John Johnson, has a short memory. "I took 
care of John Johnson the last four years because I thought John was good for 
the fighter," King said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy (Douglas) who was getting $50,000 a fight (getting) $1.3 million 
(for the Tokyo fight). That's a nice jump. And before that, every card you saw 
Buster Douglas. Now, wouldn't he even consider sitting down to discuss without 
just jumping off, and then suing me, too? 
</P>
<P>
"Now I've never talked about them negatively in any way, shape, form or 
fashion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest fight in the world for (Douglas) would be Mike Tyson. He told me 
when he was going into the ring, if I win I want the rematch. Not me asking him 
that, he told me that. So now I'm going along with what he said. Plus, the 
ennobling qualities of loyalty, integrity and honesty, commitment to these guys 
is what he's decrying. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how he got the shot, by me having a relationship with Mike Tyson. So 
now he's not going to reciprocate? He's going to abandon everything and go 
another direction because the guy put so much money on the table that he just 
found that he couldn't refuse? 
</P>
<P>
"But he still could have gotten the money. If he stayed there and be smart 
enough and we didn't have to do anything. Because I told him and his manager, I 
said, you've captured lightning in a jug. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the thing to do is to get paid. There ain't nothing wrong with getting 
paid, but we should do the same when we came to the table. Let's accommodate 
him. Let's don't try to do it at one or the other's expense." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson could not be reached for comment Friday, but before he met King in New 
York last week Johnson said, "We feel some loyalty because he helped us out 
when nobody did." 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas and Johnson reportedly believed that King didn't show Douglas 
enough "respect" when they met. 
</P>
<P>
That left the way open for Wynn, "the man," according to King, "who is 
interfering with my contract." 
</P>
<P>
"The guy don't want me to deal with (Douglas)," King said. "He wants to deal 
directly. He just wants to go to your fighters and buy them from everybody." 
</P>
<P>
For now, Tyson is odd man out. Douglas wants to fight him next February, after 
Holyfield. King said Friday that Tyson has to get back to work and that it 
wouldn't make sense for him to wait long for Douglas although King sidestepped 
a question about the possibility of Tyson fighting George Foreman. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike should be ready to fight soon," King said. 
</P>
<P>
Cayton has criticized King because Tyson has fought much more infrequently than 
he did under Cayton's direction, and that Tyson was out of shape and neither 
physically nor mentally prepared for Douglas.

UC IRVINE LOOKS OK IN 22-POINT LOSS TO UNLV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe there is hope for these UC Irvine Anteaters after all. Maybe not this 
season, but in those to come. 
</P>
<P>
Although Irvine lost to Nevada Las Vegas, 99-77, Thursday night in the Bren 
Center, the Anteaters had their moments. 
</P>
<P>
There was Jeff Von Lutzow gliding down the lane for a right-handed dunk over 
Larry Johnson in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
There was Von Lutzow again, swatting Johnson's five-foot jumper into the front 
row a moment later. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a 6-foot-7 junior, is considered to be one of the finest big men in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Dylan Rigdon driving fearlessly around Stacey Augmon, leaning in 
for a short jumper while drawing a foul. 
</P>
<P>
Augmon, the Big West Conference's player of the year last season, is widely 
considered the nation's best defender and was a 1988 Olympian, largely because 
of his defensive skills. 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow and Rigdon are freshmen. Von Lutzow had a team-high 22 points and 
five rebounds. Rigdon had 19 points and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
And Ricky Butler had 20 points, making all eight of his shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
On another night against another team, it might have added up to a victory. 
</P>
<P>
But this was UNLV, one of the best teams in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson Hunt led a late UNLV surge with 25 points, including three 
three-pointers in the final 5:36. Johnson added 23, making 10 of 13 from the 
field, and had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-ranked Rebels are 23-4 overall, 14-1 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which set a school record for losses in a season, is 3-21, 1-14.

SIMI VALLEY DOWNS MATER DEI ON HAMPTON'S GOAL IN OVERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andy Silva was especially relieved to get through his team's Southern Section 
4-A Division quarterfinal match Friday against Mater Dei High. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Simi Valley was stumped in the quarterfinals last season by 
Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, the Pioneers kept their coach in suspense through a scoreless 
regulation period and until Craig Hampton scored with nine minutes left in the 
second overtime -- 91 minutes into the match -- to give Simi Valley a 1-0 
home-field victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I just feel that the quarterfinal matches are the toughest to get through . . 
. for me," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
A shot by Kenny Greninger rebounded off a Monarch defender and back to Hampton, 
who pumped it in for the deciding goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers (27-1-0) outshot Mater Dei, 16-6. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley will play Don Lugo on Tuesday in a semifinal at a site to be 
determined. 
</P>

SMALL SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist 1, Cerritos Valley Christian 0 -- Ron Simpson scored on a penalty 
kick seven minutes into the second half and goalkeeper Jeff Hampsten recorded 
his 10th shutout to spark the Knights at home. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist (20-2-2) was awarded a penalty kick when Valley Christian 
goalkeeper Chris Miller tackled forward Dan Stepper in the penalty area in an 
effort to stop a free kick by Kurt Rayners. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinal round Tuesday, top-ranked L. A. Baptist will meet No. 3 
Harvard. The teams tied, 0-0, in a nonleague match Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard 5, Fillmore 0 -- Midfielder Andrew Weiss scored two goals, one 
unassisted, and Jerome Schwartz had two assists to pace the Saracens (18-3-4) 
at Harvard. Schwartz, striker Mark Fein and midfielder Dar Rejayan also scored 
for Harvard. 
</P>

Mission Viejo 1, Simi Valley 0 -- Sophomore midfielder Jill Florey scored off a 
head pass from Kelly Hampton with five minutes left to lift No. 8 Mission Viejo 
(19-3-3) over the top-ranked Pioneers in a 4-A match in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley defender Liz Albin dislocated her hip late in the second half and 
was treated at Mission Regional Medical Center. Goalkeeper Kim Duran, who has 
43 career shutouts, made eight stops for Simi Valley (26-2), the Marmonte 
League champion. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands 1, Agoura 0 -- The Chargers' season ended as visiting Redlands 
(15-4-6) scored what Agoura Coach Don Hagenburger termed a "fluke goal" in a 
3-A match. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (23-2-2), which had won four consecutive division titles, outshot 
Redlands, 25-3.

TOON SPARKS SEMIFINAL WIN FOR VAN NUYS; 
</P>
<P>
GIRLS' BASKETBALL: SENIOR CENTER SCORES 26 POINTS AS WOLVES DISPATCH NARBONNE, 
60-43, AND EARN CITY FINAL BERTH.

<P>
Van Nuys High Coach Tony Magnante took something less than an optimistic stance 
before his team faced Narbonne in a girls' City Section 4-A Division semifinal 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we can say we made it to the Sports Arena," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, he can say more than that. The Wolves surprised even themselves by 
pounding Narbonne, 60-43, at the Sports Arena to become the school's first 
girls' basketball team in seven years to advance to a City final. The 1983 team 
advanced to the championship game where it was defeated by Fairfax. Van Nuys 
(22-3) will play for the title next Friday at the Sports Arena against 
top-seeded Washington, which routed Carson on Friday, 73-34. 
</P>
<P>
Stacie Toon, a 6-foot senior center, carried the Wolves into the final, scoring 
26 points and grabbing 17 rebounds against Narbonne, both game-high totals. She 
converted 10 of 15 field-goal attempts and was perfect on six free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even describe how great it feels to win here," Toon said. "Just to say 
that we won this game is enough to cap my senior year." 
</P>
<P>
But Magnante's gloomy pregame forecast appeared accurate after the Wolves 
started slowly and trailed, 15-8, at the end of the first quarter. Van Nuys, 
however, rallied in the second period and took a 21-19 lead on a basket by Toon 
with 1 minute 42 seconds left before halftime. Van Nuys made six of six free 
throws in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"That really helped us," Toon said. "We were nervous in the first quarter, but 
after the ball started going in, we were more confident." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys took control in the third quarter behind Feltina Means, a 5-foot-3 
senior guard who scored 10 of her 18 points in the period. The Wolves expanded 
a 23-22 halftime lead to 42-33 and started the fourth quarter with an 8-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
Means finished the game seven of 11 from the field and made four of four free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys helped its cause at the free-throw line, sinking 17 of 22 attempts 
(77%). Narbonne hit only 10 of 22 (45%). 
</P>
<P>
Huong Thai, the Wolves' 4-foot-10 point guard, played with a sore neck and back 
she sustained in a car accident this week. Regardless, the diminutive dribbler 
scored six points and had 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"Huong is the key to our offense," Magnante said. "I don't care if she scores 
zero points, she passes the ball to our scorers. She is the key to our team." 
</P>
<P>
Thai had problems early in the game when Narbonne (18-8) forced eight turnovers 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know that they had so many short girls like me," Thai said. "Usually 
the other team has to reach down to catch me." 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne's Shasta Paris scored 13 points and had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington is going to be the toughest game we've ever played," Means said. 
"It'll be depressing if we lose after we got this far."

DOS PUEBLOS STOPS HARVARD WITH SURGE IN FINAL QUARTER 
</P>

<P>
Mark Estabrook scored 12 of his game-high 27 points in the fourth quarter to 
lead Dos Pueblos High to a 76-65 upset of top-seeded Harvard in a Southern 
Section 3-A Division semifinal playoff game at San Marcos High on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos (15-13), the fourth-place team from the Channel League, held a 
48-47 lead heading into the fourth quarter, but an 11-4 run in the first four 
minutes sparked the Chargers to the win. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Pueblos converted 16 of 18 free throws in the fourth quarter to seal the 
victory and finished 27 of 32 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Harvard (23-3), the San Fernando Valley League champion, attempted 
only nine free throws, making six. 
</P>
<P>
"They were phenomenal at the free-throw line," Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard 
said. "We haven't seen shooting like that all year." 
</P>
<P>
It was a close battle throughout, with Harvard holding its only lead of the 
game at intermission, 34-33. 
</P>
<P>
Estabrook made a quick basket and a free throw in the first 11 seconds of the 
third period and Harvard never led again. 
</P>
<P>
Estabrook and 6-6 forward Chris Gaines (24 points and 13 rebounds) spurred the 
Chargers in the final quarter, outscoring the Saracens, 28-18. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard guard Mike Wolf scored a team-high 24 points, and the only other 
Saracen in double figures was center Andres Carlo, who had 14 points and 10 
rebounds. Rick Osterloh, the team's leading scorer, was plagued with foul 
trouble and scored only eight points. 
</P>
<P>
"They played well, they played smart, and they took away what we do well," 
Hilliard said. "We couldn't get our running game going and we didn't get back 
on defense." PAUL OLSON

SHARTS, VIGO LIFT CSUN WITH KEY HOME RUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as Cal State Northridge was about to be enveloped by darkness and its own 
error-prone play Friday, Scott Sharts, Denny Vigo and a soon-to-be beleaguered 
relief ace named Jamy Villa reduced the game of baseball to its basics. 
</P>
<P>
The result was an unlikely 10-9 victory for CSUN over California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. foe Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Villa, Dominguez Hills' hard-throwing closer, faced Sharts, CSUN's Sultan of 
Swat, with one on, two out, and the Toros clinging to a two-run lead in the 
bottom of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then George Wing, Dominguez Hills' coach, sauntered to the mound. Keep the ball 
in on his hands, Wing told his ace right-hander. Nothing out over the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The count went to three balls and two strikes and Villa did exactly what he was 
told not to do: He threw a fastball over the outside portion of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
It was last seen sailing over the fence in right center field -- Sharts' third 
home run in three hours. It ties the score. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Vigo, CSUN's other Matador of Muscle, as Northridge Coach Bill 
Kernen offered a tip for his sophomore slugger as the sun dipped under the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Kernen, fearing that the umpire was about to suspend the game because of 
darkness, wanted to make sure the previous two runs would count. Swing for the 
fence, he told Vigo. If you strike out, we're tied and we can start all over 
another day. And if you hit it . . . 
</P>
<P>
Vigo soon addressed that possibility, blasting a full-count fastball high over 
the left-field fence to keep CSUN undefeated in three CCAA games, 8-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, we dodged a bullet," Kernen said. "We made a baserunning error, we 
threw the ball around on defense and we didn't throw strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"But we did hit the ball well." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Northridge punched out 14 hits, including five home runs -- a 
school-record-tying three by Sharts and two by Vigo -- against a trio of Toro 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
Vigo's game-winner -- his fourth homer in three games -- afforded the Matadors 
an opportunity to forget, at least temporarily, three errors, seven walks, and 
a base-running blunder by Greg Shockey that almost cost them the game. 
</P>
<P>
Shockey led off the bottom of the ninth with a single, advanced to second when 
Eric Johnson walked, then was caught in a rundown when he failed to break for 
third on a hit-and-run play. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Todd Denhart pitched a rather shaky 4 2/3 innings to pick up his 
second victory. Denhart allowed three runs, two earned, on six hits, and he 
walked one and struck out six after replacing starter Monte Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 6-3, after four innings, scoring twice in the first, twice in 
the third -- on back-to-back homers by Sharts and Vigo -- and two more in the 
fourth on a two-run blast by Sharts, who would finish with four hits and six 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez (6-4-1, 0-1) took the lead with a four-run fifth inning, then added 
two more in the seventh. CSUN pushed over an unearned run in the seventh.

GRAY'S TIME RAN OUT AFTER FIRING OF HARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED EISENHAMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the day Dick Harter was fired as the Charlotte Hornets' coach, 7-foot center 
Stuart Gray knew his days on that expansion team were numbered. So there were 
no surprises Thursday when Gray was traded to the New York Knicks for a 
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
Gray, a former Kennedy High standout, was acquired by the Hornets from the 
Indiana Pacers at the urging of Harter, who had worked with Gray while employed 
as a Pacer assistant. But Harter was fired Jan. 31 and replaced by Gene 
Littles. 
</P>
<P>
Gray played in only one of the Hornets' next eight games -- for eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Dick was gone, (Charlotte management) wanted a witch hunt to get rid of 
anyone he brought in," Gray said from New York on Friday night. "I was one of 
them. (Jerry) Sichting (who was cut on Thursday) was another. And I don't think 
they're through yet." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who averaged 2.6 points and 3.4 rebounds for the second-year Hornets, is 
expected to back up Patrick Ewing with the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Gray and his wife, Ruthanne, moved into a new home in Charlotte, N.C., just 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to try to sell it," said Gray. "I like Charlotte. I have no 
problems with Charlotte per se. It's the team that kinda disappointed me. The 
(Charlotte) people, though, are great. They've really accepted the team there." 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets are in last place in the Western Conference's Midwest Division. The 
Knicks, on the other hand, lead the Eastern Conference's Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel really good about the trade," said Gray, who plans to suit up for 
Sunday's nationally televised game against the Detroit Pistons.

DAVE DISTEL: TO TURN PRO OR NOT? ANSWER WAS EASY FOR CORONADO'S GAVALDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great thinkers and lawmakers, perhaps an incongruous alliance, spend 
considerable time contemplating the consequences of athletes turning 
professional after their junior years of college competition. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard the fuss surrounding, for example, the deliberations of one Junior 
Seau, an aptly named young man from Oceanside who has been employed as a 
football player at USC and seeks to improve himself by moving to the more 
lucrative NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Seau ultimately resolved that it was time to be paid by check rather than by 
room and board, but not before his ponderings had been examined so thoroughly 
you would think he had been asked to determine the outcome of the 
SDG&amp;E-SoCal Edison merger. 
</P>
<P>
The wisdom that must prevail, of course, is that a person cannot be prohibited 
from making a living in a chosen field, regardless of whether or not athletic 
eligibility has been exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly interesting this week, because another junior from this 
neighborhood turned professional without accompanying brouhaha and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't such a big decision," said The Athlete. "I did it because it was 
time." 
</P>
<P>
But Angelica "The Athlete" Gavaldon has little in common with the collegiate 
behemoths who crave to play for pay in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, Gavaldon did not choose to turn pro after her junior year, but 
rather during. What's more, Gavaldon is doing all this while a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Gavaldon, all of 16 and a year removed from winning her second CIF 
championship for Our Lady of Peace, made her professional debut this week in 
the $150,000 Virginia Slims of Oklahoma. She advanced to the today's semifinals 
by defeating Brenda Schultz of the Netherlands, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who followed her exploits at the Australian Open would not have been 
surprised by her decision. She reached the quarterfinals in that tournament, 
which is a Grand Slam event and not a parochial exercise lost somewhere in the 
outback. 
</P>
<P>
That tournament was, in fact, the turning point in making the decision now 
rather than waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely," she said by telephone from her hotel room. "On the way home on 
the airplane, my mom and I were discussing it. We decided I would turn pro 
after I was in the top 100." 
</P>
<P>
Why, after all, remain an amateur? To win another CIF championship? To earn a 
college scholarship? 
</P>
<P>
When Gavaldon arrived home in Coronado, she learned she was ranked 97th in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The time had come. 
</P>
<P>
The time had come to get paid for playing well. By her recollection, she would 
have pocketed $24,000 for her showing in the Australian Open. As an amateur, 
she was limited to expense money. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that she played as an amateur in 10 tournaments in 1989, how much 
money might she already have won? 
</P>
<P>
"Around . . . ," she said, hesitating and then laughing. "I don't really know, 
and I'll have a fit if I think about it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a 16-year-old cannot worry too much about lost time. The future 
belongs to her, years and years of it. 
</P>
<P>
Gavaldon's biggest problem, perhaps, is finding time to study. She is taking 
literature, American history, art and biology via correspondence courses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard," she said. "It's like going to school, except I don't have 
anyone to explain things to me." 
</P>
<P>
She probably could use an economics course, as well, because she is going to 
make a lot of money playing this game she started learning eight years ago when 
the family lived in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom played for fun, and my dad played, too," she said. "They put me into 
tennis lessons, and I started playing some tournaments and winning. Everything 
started getting really serious after I started winning." 
</P>
<P>
When the family moved to Coronado, Gavaldon kept right on winning. 
</P>
<P>
But Angelica, has it become too serious? 
</P>
<P>
"It's my career," she said. "It has to be serious. But it's still really fun, 
and I'm enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
But what of those high school days? Football games? Dances? Yearbook pictures? 
</P>
<P>
"You miss out on a lot," she said, "but I think I'm better off doing this. And 
I want to be somebody in life." 
</P>
<P>
And so Angelica Gavaldon's prof tennis career is on its way. It's business now, 
a serious business, but one in which she can seriously have some fun and also 
make some serious money. 
</P>
<P>
That, in short, is the difference between this week and last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think much about it," Gavaldon said. "Playing tennis is just 
about the same as a professional or as an amateur. It wasn't any big decision." 
</P>
<P>
No big decision at all. Not when the time is right.

left unprotected by the Washington Redskins, has signed with the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, 6-feet-7 and 300 pounds, started 11 games in 1989 and played in 15. He 
is the first of 17 unprotected Chargers to sign with another team before the 
April 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Mickles, 5-10, 210, played in nine games on special teams for the Redskins and 
did not have a carry. He spent the first six games and the last one on injured 
reserve with a knee injury. He was drafted last April by Charger General 
Manager Bobby Beathard when Beathard held the same position with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
Mickles is the second Plan B player to sign with the Chargers. Bruce Plummer, a 
cornerback from Indianapolis, signed earlier this week. CURT HOLBREICH

MOVIES: FOR THE FIRST TIME, TWO SOVIET FILM FIRMS ARE TAKING PART IN AMERICAN 
FILM MARKET, HAWKING TITLES THEY FEEL HAVE INTERNATIONAL APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood has long issued warnings -- silly as well as serious -- that the 
Russians were coming. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the Russians are here. And they're targeting Hollywood. Their purpose: 
cinematic glasnost -- not to mention commercial gain. The battlefield: the 
American Film Market, the world's largest motion-picture trade event that 
opened Thursday and continues through Friday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. (The 
market is not open to the public.) 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of more than 115 U.S. and 85 foreign companies that license 
motion pictures are in attendance. So are about 20 firms that sell 
entertainment-related products/services. Plus, 685 prospective film buyers. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 10-year history of the film market, two Soviet 
companies are vying for the attention of those buyers -- as well as American 
film makers interested in co-ventures. Also on hand from Eastern Europe: Film 
Polski and Czechoslovak/lfex Films. 
</P>
<P>
From their respective suites, situated at opposite ends of the Hilton, Mosfilm 
and Sovexportfilm are each hawking Soviet-made titles that they believe have 
appeal for American and international moviegoers. While here, both companies 
also plan to do some buying of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the Moscow-based Sovexportfilm was the only Soviet 
representative at the market -- a status that officially began in 1987. (In 
1986, Sovexportfilm sent representatives to observe the proceedings.) Founded 
more than 60 years ago, Sovexportfilm is the country's biggest 
importer/exporter of films. Until recently, it was the country's only such 
firm. But in the spirit of perestroika (and with lessening restrictions on 
foreign-trade activities), there is now competition -- namely, the powerful 
Mosfilm. The biggest studio in the Soviet Union, Mosfilm makes about 50 films a 
year -- roughly half the country's film output -- plus about a dozen TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
To sell their films, both Mosfilm and Sovexportfilm are touting the newly 
liberated Soviet cinema. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nudity," smiles Sovexportfilm public relations representative Oleg M. 
Sulkin. "Our film makers are now exploring narcotics, prostitution and crime," 
exclaims Vladimir N. Dostal, general director of Mosfilm. Dostal also happens 
to serve as deputy chairman of the State Committee on Cinematography of the 
U.S.S.R. -- also known as Goskino -- an irony, since Goskino once kept tight 
control over the country's film makers. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Moscow, Goskino used to oversee the scripts from the country's 15 
republics. Censorship was common. But as new freedoms have swept the country, 
Goskino's role has changed. It now acts as more of a coordinator of various 
film activities. 
</P>
<P>
Today, pornography remains prohibited. But just about everything else seems to 
go -- judging from the promotional materials in the Mosfilm and Sovexportfilm 
suites. 
</P>
<P>
A promotional trailer for Sovexportfilm's "Zero City," a surrealistic social 
satire from Soviet film maker Karen Shakhnazarov, includes female frontal 
nudity -- and bizarre Daliesque sights, such as a sequence in which the main 
character sees an exact likeness of his head on a platter. A knife then cuts 
into the head, extracting a piece of it (it has a cake-like texture) and 
carefully placing it on a serving plate. 
</P>
<P>
A company promotional catalogue, which solemnly acknowledges Russian classics 
available on videocassette such as "Battleship Potemkin" and "October," 
includes plenty of nudity to hype its contemporary product. Then there's the 
large-format Sovexportfilm calendar (a giveaway to some lucky film market 
visitors), which is a virtual pin-up parade of Soviet screen actresses. 
</P>
<P>
This particular exercise in glasnost ranges from a California girl-ish Anna 
Tikhonova in blue jeans and jean jacket, posing with posies, to a shot of 
Yelena Sotnikova, wearing a smile and some strategically draped 35-millimeter 
film. She's biting suggestively into an apple. 
</P>
<P>
Mosfilm's most highly touted product, the contemporary romantic tragicomedy 
"Black Rose, Red Rose," is being hyped with promotional materials that include 
nude photos of an androgynous character known as "Homo Sovieticus." 
</P>
<P>
Mosfilm is also selling the taboo-shattering "Up to the Limit." "It deals with 
a subject that couldn't have been done before," says Dostal. The story line: A 
rebel within a modern-day Soviet prison-camp leads his fellow prisoners in an 
uprising against "the ruthless camp's system." 
</P>
<P>
A Mosfilm "proclamation of independence" hand-out stresses that the studio has 
come to the market "free of government control." The proclamation goes on to 
sing the praises of seven films it is selling, as well as film services 
including "13 sound stages, 5,000 highly qualified professionals and resources 
that include anything from tanks and airplanes to a 3,000-horse cavalry unit." 
Western producers are further promised "fantastic deals at extremely 
competitive prices." 
</P>
<P>
Still another sign of burgeoning Soviet competition: a film on the boards at 
Mosfilm will be shot simultaneously in both English and Russian. According to 
Dostal, the Soviet actors who will star in the tentatively titled "Cossacks," 
an epic about a real life 15th-Century Cossack hero who united the tribes of 
Siberia, are currently studying English. (Shooting is scheduled to begin late 
this year.) 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to the oft-troublesome translation and dubbing problems of 
Soviet-to-English films (the languages are so different that dialogue almost 
never seems in sync with the characters), Dostal admits, "If Americans will not 
come to our movies, we will bring our movies to them." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there's another Soviet presence among the AFM crowd: the U.S.S.R. 
Film Service, a division of Soyuzkinoservice, which was formed 20-years ago to 
assist Western film makers in the Soviet Union. But where the company used to 
wait for film makers to come to them, it now courts them. A Los Angeles office 
was opened in June, 1989. By June of this year, a New York office is expected 
to be in operation, said president Yuri Spilny, who is attending the film 
market along with chief executive officer David Gamburg. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Mosfilm and Sovexportfilm, Spilny's U.S.S.R. Film Service doesn't have 
films to sell. What it hawks is access -- and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: an American film maker in search of a Siberian village location 
recently approached U.S.S.R. Film Service. They suggested Seerdlovsk, in the 
Ural Mountains of Southern Siberia, not too far from a film studio in 
Novosibirsk, where there are the necessary accommodations. (A deal is now 
pending.) When Carolco Pictures and Turner Entertainment went in search of 
locations for their upcoming TV production "Last Warning," about the Chernobyl 
disaster, U.S.S.R. Film Service found a Chernobyl look-alike power station in 
Kurchatuv. 
</P>
<P>
Along with rounding up facilities and locations, U.S.S.R. Film Service provides 
location consultants to counter any problems with language/customs. "In a way, 
we are selling confidence to Americans," says Spilny, adding, "And at the same 
time, we are educating the Soviet side." 
</P>
<P>
Spilny believes that because of recent changes in Eastern Europe, there will be 
a new hunger to see movies filmed in, and about, the Soviet Union. Says Spilny: 
"The doors are now wide open -- and the world is peering in."

ANGRY PREACHING PUTS UNNECESSARY SHACKLES ON 'FREEDOM AND OTHER MYTHS'

<TEXT>
<P>
Freedom was America's rallying cry when it broke from Great Britain in 1776. 
But, in 214 years, if Americans have learned anything, it is that freedom is 
more than just pushing someone's army off your soil. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom is also the freedom to think, to feel, to believe and to love whom one 
loves, regardless of race, creed or sex. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fried, in a series of monologues called "Freedom and Other Myths" at 
Sushi Performance Gallery tonight, wonders whether America is really 
comfortable with freedom. Aren't stereotypes and racial slurs a way of limiting 
freedom by keeping people in some predetermined place, he asks in "Jungle 
Bunny." 
</P>
<P>
It's a nice point, but one that smacks of preaching to the converted. It is 
hard to imagine any of the dozen or so people who turned up at Sushi on opening 
night defending stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
Fried makes some elegant points about the illusion of freedom in America: "We 
were free to be what we were taught we were supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
But he slips just as easily into banality when he describes how he felt being 
identified first as a Jew, then as a gay. "I was an object, not a person." 
</P>
<P>
Standing alone on a corner of the bare Sushi space, with a chair, a hot white 
light and a compact disc player, Fried holds out the promise of intimacy with 
the storyteller. Fried's best moments come when he lets the dogma go and tells 
us stories that feel personal and true. 
</P>
<P>
The best piece in the 90-minute show is called "Abbott," a tale originally 
presented at the "Actors for Life" benefit in San Diego. It tells the story of 
a man who died of AIDS-related pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
"There was this one time with Abbott," he begins with music playing softly in 
the background. As the story unravels, it delves into the coming of age of the 
narrator and the emotional devastation left by his father's death. It becomes 
the story of a friendship, replete with all the longings, frustrations and 
satisfactions that come with caring deeply. It becomes a story of loss for 
anyone who has lost someone dear and doesn't know what to do with his feelings 
for that person anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The story, as narrative, has its flaws. Instead of staying one step ahead of 
the listener, Fried throws out clue after clue that Abbott has AIDS, without 
letting his narrator catch on. (Abbott shows up at the door tired and weak, 
after having suffered from shingles and pneumonia; he cheers up at the thought 
of crashing on a roadside, and the narrator doesn't have a clue that anything 
is wrong with him?) 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, the narrator never once questions that he himself may have caught 
AIDS from Abbott, even though they had been lovers once. 
</P>
<P>
Is it really possible that this man has not a thought in the world for himself? 
</P>
<P>
But the sense of the narrator's heart hurting is, ultimately, what touches the 
listener's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Fried also touches on the '60s. The usual points are made about love-ins and 
people wanting their rights, and Fried is back into his role of the angry 
preacher, explaining acidly to all the morons out there how we all have ears 
but do not hear, etc. etc. 
</P>
<P>
The tedium of these holier-than-thou moments would make it easy to dismiss this 
show if it were not for other moments, all too brief, when Fried turns to the 
personal tales that draw the listener in. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it is the personal narratives that hold the promise of moving 
mountains more than the overtly political points do. Fried has a rich ore of 
material to dig from in the story of the disenfranchised gay class seeking its 
place in America. Let him avail himself of the freedom to explore that tale in 
its fullness, and he will find a greater wealth of stories than he has found 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"FREEDOM AND OTHER MYTHS"

A FINE NEW PRINCESS APPEARS IN A TACKY OLD 'TURANDOT'

Her name is Ealynn Voss. Don't forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, courtesy of Opera Pacific at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, she calmly stepped out of a silly plastic bubble and laid instant claim 
to one of the most formidable roles in all opera. Hats off, gentlemen. A 
Turandot. 
</P>
<P>
The vocal challenge of Puccini's icy protagonist has defeated many an 
illustrious pretender. The role isn't very long, but it is very cruel. 
</P>
<P>
The tessitura lies high, and the line is dangerously exposed. Puccini demanded 
a voice of steel, an Italian Brunnhilde, if you will. He wanted a soprano who 
could dominate a massive orchestra, a convulsive chorus and, when desperate, a 
highly competitive tenor. 
</P>
<P>
The first of numerous heroic climaxes arrives with Turandot's entrance aria. 
Before the opera ends, when love melts the heroine's heart, a successful 
interpreter must also demonstrate some affinity for lyrical expansion. 
</P>
<P>
A late bloomer who happens to live in Malibu, Voss managed it all. She was so 
persuasive, in fact, that one wanted to overlook the bizarre, hand-me-down 
decors by Allen Charles Klein that pretend "Turandot" takes place amid the 
clutter of some tacky old Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Voss couldn't make a weak chorus strong or a thin orchestra thick. She couldn't 
energize a lethargic conductor (Louis Salemno). She couldn't compensate for the 
excessive frailty of an Emperor (Riki Matsufuji) equipped with a very long 
beard and a very short voice. 
</P>
<P>
But she could sing. Her soprano, always bright and well-focused, cut through 
the opposing fabric with authority. Her generally cool tone took on an added 
gleam at the top. She didn't force. She didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
She asserted lofty majesty, yet hinted at the character's underlying anxiety, 
with "In questa reggia." She conveyed sympathetic pathos in "Del primo pianto." 
She also provided a grandiose counterforce for the exquisite Liu of Maria 
Spacagna. 
</P>
<P>
Although somewhat matronly in demeanor, Voss looked properly statuesque in 
Klein's ornate robes and outrageous headgear. As directed by Matthew Lata, she 
struck the wonted poses with primitive, nicely muted urgency. 
</P>
<P>
Other roles will tell us more, of course, about her versatility, and about the 
solidity of her middle register. Let us hope that she husbands her resources 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
She was to have been partnered by an equally new Calaf, Giorgio Tieppo. The 
duties of the unknown prince fell once again, however, to Lando Bartolini, who 
capitalized on easy, ringing fervor. The management offered no official apology 
for the cast change, but the unhappy Tieppo -- who was found sitting out front 
-- explained that Opera Pacific had mistakenly contracted both tenors for the 
same performance. His chance would come later. 
</P>
<P>
The company also turned out to be a bit negligent in its program materials. The 
name of Franco Alfano, who completed the opera after Puccini's death, was 
nowhere mentioned. Although 21 pages were devoted to production credits and 
sponsor acknowledgements, no room could be found for historic annotation. 
Orange County audiences deserve better.

BLACK CHURCH'S GOSPEL OPERA TO BENEFIT LOS ANGELES FESTIVAL; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: THE BLACK COMMUNITY'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE L.A. FESTIVAL THIS YEAR IS 
SEEN AS SPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT, SINCE BLACKS WERE VIRTUALLY SHUT OUT OF THE 1987 
VERSION.

<P>
It's 7 p.m. on a weeknight, and the Mid City-area parking lot of the First 
A.M.E. Church is overflowing. Inside, more than 100 church members -- wearing 
everything from nice dresses to sweat pants -- are milling around in a 
downstairs meeting room, greeting one another and partaking of coffee, cookies 
and hot chocolate. Then, after a fervent prayer, they begin to sing. 
</P>
<P>
Such has been the scene -- three hours a night, five nights a week -- for the 
past month. About 185 First A.M.E. Church members -- all volunteers -- have 
been putting together a benefit production of the gospel opera "Job," which 
opens Sunday at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre. Organizers hope to raise $75,000 
for September's Los Angeles Festival through the production, which will 
continue at the theater on March 9 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
"Our community needed to be involved because culture touches the soul," said 
Remell Hence, a First A.M.E. member, executive producer of "Job," and chair of 
the African-American Community's efforts to raise a total of $100,000 (with the 
remainder coming from individual and corporate donations) for the 
Pacific-themed arts festival. "Once culture touches the soul, we can see how 
much the same we all are, and we thought we had to raise our share to make that 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike festival fund-raising efforts by other segments of the community -- 
such as the Asian sector, which is working toward it's $2-million fund-raising 
goal through large corporate donations -- Hence said the black community must 
do its work through the church. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the people are in the black community," she said. "We've been 
shut out of the country clubs and that type of thing, but we are here in our 
churches." 
</P>
<P>
The black community's involvement is much touted by festival organizers. For 
the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, key organizers said, the African-American 
community was virtually overlooked in both the planning and participation 
stages. Thus, their involvement this year is seen as especially important. 
</P>
<P>
(In July of 1987, members of Dance Umbrella, a service organization for black 
dancers, charged that local black dance troupes had been left out of the 
festival and petitioned the City Council for funds to produce a separate 
minority arts festival to coincide with the Los Angeles Festival. The council 
took no action on the matter. At that time, the festival's then associate 
director, Thomas Schumacher, said that the black community was represented in 
the multi-cultural program through foreign black artists, classical jazz 
performers and others.) 
</P>
<P>
Cecil (Chip) Murray, senior minister of First A.M.E. Church and a recognized 
leader in the black community, said financial backing of the festival by his 
community is vital, especially since the next Los Angeles Festival (scheduled 
for 1992 or 1993) is planned to focus on the African continent. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't have participation on the stages without participation in the work -- 
no inspiration without perspiration," said Murray. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent pep-talk to "Job" cast members, L.A. Festival Director Peter 
Sellars underscored the symbolic importance of the participation of the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the most segregated city I've ever lived in," said Sellars. "But as 
you set foot on this stage, you are created equal. The point is that culture, 
art, is not something people should have to go buy. It's something you're born 
with. It's something you own already." 
</P>
<P>
The "Job" production is led by a professional star -- Gospel recording artist 
and Stellar award winner Daryl Coley -- and a professional director -- Cliff 
Roquemore, who has directed a number of inner-city theater productions, 
including "The Gospel Truth," "For Heaven's Sake," and a boxing musical called 
"TKO." While most of the production staff and musicians are also paid, most of 
the planners and the more than 100 additional cast members are all volunteers. 
But Roquemore says that won't hurt the caliber of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've ever worked with a complete group of novices -- 
98% of them have never done anything but sing in church, but they're working 
better than most of the professionals in Los Angeles," Roquemore said. "They're 
more dedicated, they take instruction better. It's gonna blow people's minds to 
see (this production). It's blowing my mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Job," which takes the biblical story and sets it in current times, was written 
two years ago by First A.M.E.'s minister of music, Joe Westmoreland, and 
pianist, Charles May. The church's Freedom Choir then performed the piece -- 
which at that time had no dialogue -- for approximately 35,000 people at a 
national A.M.E. church conference in Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Said Westmoreland, who also worked with Roquemore to add dialogue to the 
production: " 'Job' is about the basic human emotions of being wealthy, then 
being poor, your children dying, and your friends turning against you but still 
surviving and having an unshakable faith in God." 
</P>
<P>
Westmoreland said sharing Job's story is a large motivation for volunteers 
performing in and working with "Job." But in addition, he said, "It will give 
them an opportunity to be a little part of history. . . . It is an honor to 
help the black community participate (in the Los Angeles Festival) and to be 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Conner, a drummer for the church who plays a servant in the production, 
says the hours spent rehearsing for "Job" will pay off for several reasons. 
"I'm an artist in general -- a drummer and a songwriter -- and I thought it 
would be a good experience for me as well as a chance to show my versatility. 
In addition, it's a worthwhile effort. It's a good cause. And it's a good story 
-- people need to know about Job, because in today's world people are not that 
faithful." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for "Job," which will be presented at 7 p.m. on Sunday and at 8 p.m. on 
March 9 and 16, range from $15-$50. Information: (213) 689-8800 or (213) 
221-9556.

DISPUTE OVER CEMETERY RAGES AMID JEWISH DECLINE IN EGYPT; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSITION: AL BASATIN, AN AGING JEWISH BURIAL GROUND, IS THE UNLIKELY CENTER 
OF AN AGELESS DISPUTE OVER PROGRESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
On a windy plateau adjoining the vast City of the Dead, 350 crumbling Jewish 
tombs represent much of what remains of the people Moses delivered out of 
slavery. Amid the honking taxis and high-rise apartment buildings that now 
populate the cities of Egypt, the Jews seem destined to disappear from the 
country forever. 
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 Jews dominated Egypt's wealthy merchant class in the early 
20th Century. Now, barely 64 are believed to remain. There is in all of Cairo 
only one Jewish family. The last rabbi left in 1972. There are no bar mitzvahs. 
There are no weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"The very big problem is when one dies, there is not another born in his 
place," said Jacques Jaffe, a 78-year-old former textile merchant who is one of 
the few native Jews left in Egypt. "The battle will finish because there are no 
fighters. This is the story." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years after Egypt's official peace treaty with Israel, the late President 
Anwar Sadat's pleas for the Jews to return to Egypt have gone unheeded, and the 
aging Jewish cemetery on Cairo's outskirts has become an unlikely new boiling 
point for an ageless dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Plagued with choking traffic that for several hours a day virtually paralyzes 
Cairo, the city's engineers are in the midst of a $197-million project to 
construct a ring road to allow much of the regional traffic to skirt the 
teeming heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Several substantial sections of the highway already have been built, including 
approaches near both ends of the 1,021-year-old Jewish cemetery of Al Basatin, 
believed to be the oldest continuous Jewish cemetery in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers were due to plow into the cemetery last month until a rabbinical 
delegation from around the world stepped in when Cairo's dwindling Jewish 
population proved unable or unwilling to take on the Egyptian authorities over 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute -- which has drawn in rabbis from Israel, England, France, Canada, 
Switzerland and the United States, as well as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
-- has become a symptom of the chilly peace that has existed between Egypt and 
Israel in the years since the Camp David accords. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Israeli government has carefully avoided any role in the cemetery 
dispute, talk of 20 years of war between Egypt and Israel has emerged during 
talk about the dead, and few -- Egyptian or Israeli -- express surprise that 
peace with Israel has failed to rejuvenate Egypt's dying Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
"The peace treaty came 10 years too late," one diplomat said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish population of the 1930s and 1940s was among the most successful and 
cosmopolitan in Egypt, dominating Alexandria's social scene and operating 
banks, factories and department stores all over Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
But the creation of Israel in 1948 sent the first wave of immigrants out of 
Egypt to populate the new Jewish state. And the Egyptian revolution and the 
subsequent 1956 war with Israel created a backlash against Egyptian Jews that 
sent many of those who remained fleeing for Europe, Israel and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, barely 1,500 Jews remained in Egypt. 
Their numbers have been dwindling since. 
</P>
<P>
The peace treaty so far has been insufficient to attract Israeli businessmen 
back to economically troubled Egypt, and many Egyptians have been content to 
leave it that way. Egypt's syndicates for lawyers, journalists and engineers 
still forbid members to have contact with Israel. Egyptian newspapers rail 
about Israeli leaders' perceived recalcitrance in settling the Palestinian 
issue, and, in many cases, still refer to Israel as "the Zionist entity." 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really say, 'Let's get on with being friendly and forget the past,' 
" explained Hussein Husseini, a well-known Egyptian journalist. "This will not 
happen, not with this generation -- perhaps not with the next." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most expect Egypt's Jewish community to disappear within the next 
few years, and a new crop of Israeli Jews, most say, probably will not emerge 
in Egypt unless the troubling Palestinian issue is settled. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, the cemetery debate has nothing to do with peace treaties, but 
nearly everyone involved admits that politics has fueled much of the emotional 
fervor. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, Egyptian authorities say privately that they fear a backlash 
from their own citizens if they give special treatment to the Jewish cemetery, 
when nearby Muslim and Coptic Christian graveyards already have been moved to 
make way for the new highway. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is no problem, except all the Jews in the world make it a 
problem," said Mohammed Raschi Morad, Cairo's director of reconstruction and 
overseer of the ring road project. 
</P>
<P>
The matter was about to be resolved a year ago when Cairo's Jewish community 
agreed to move the 350 graves to Israel or to a nearby location in exchange for 
a $31,400 settlement from the government to cover the costs, and provided that 
a rabbi from Israel perform the appropriate ceremonies to consecrate the new 
grave sites. 
</P>
<P>
The chief rabbi in Israel appeared poised to approve the plan when rabbinical 
groups from the United States stepped in and quickly drew support from other 
rabbis around the world. Last month, former Sephardi Chief Rabbi Ovadia Yosef 
issued a statement declaring he had never given permission to transfer the 
bones buried at Al Basatin and insisted that "the graves must be left intact." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to take this lying down," declared Brooklyn, N.Y., Rabbi 
Herpz Frankel, chairman of the International Society to Preserve Jewish 
Cemeteries. "The world Jewish opinion is united in this effort to achieve the 
goal of preserving this cemetery, period. If the Egyptian government brings the 
bulldozers, they will pay the consequences, I think, frankly speaking." 
</P>
<P>
A rabbinical committee that toured the site with engineers in November suggests 
building a bridge over the cemetery, or perhaps a tunnel below it, to preserve 
the graves. 
</P>
<P>
Morad says he would go along with the plan if the rabbinical group could also 
suggest where to find the estimated $80 million to $100 million such a 
diversion would cost. And what, he asks, of the bones buried beneath the 
pilings of an overpass? 
</P>
<P>
Another plan suggests relocating the bodies and building a fence around the new 
cemetery at government expense, a proposal that is now tied up in the Egyptian 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
The aging president of the Jewish community in Cairo died in November, and his 
successor, Emil Russo, throws up his hands when asked about the cemetery. He 
says he is leaving it for the rabbis to debate.

DISCOVERY: RUTABEGORZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Back in 1969, four college students at Cal State Fullerton dreamed of opening a 
coffeehouse in Fullerton. In 1971, after two years of planning, they opened 
Rutabegorz, named after the rutabaga -- a turnip-like vegetable. They wanted to 
bring to Orange County the Bohemian atmosphere found in the coffeehouses of New 
York and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The current owner and member of the original group that started the restaurant, 
Paul Berkman, says, "We wanted to create a place where people could come and be 
themselves, where they could sit down and have a lively conversation, read 
poetry, play music, hang their paintings or play chess while drinking espresso. 
We introduced espresso and cappuccino to many Orange County residents almost 
two decades before the recent resurgence of coffeehouses in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
In the early days, the restaurant survived with the help of friends and 
customers who pitched in to make repairs to the 57-year-old Mediterranean-style 
building that is today a local landmark. "We put together this restaurant with 
what money we had. When it was time to replace the espresso maker, I had to 
sell my Volkswagen van to finance a new one." 
</P>
<P>
No 1960s subculture gathering place's history would be complete without a clash 
with the Establishment, and Rutabegorz was no exception. "Many people were 
against us. They did not want a restaurant like this in Orange County -- a 
place where young people would sit and talk for hours about war and other 
topics." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, the telephone company wanted to tear down Rutabegorz to accommodate 
the expansion of its service center. The local community rallied, protests were 
held, and after a court battle, the utility acquiesced and the property was 
sold to the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Berkman has seen changes in the attitudes of his customers. "It 
used to be that you could come in with a guitar and play folk songs and command 
a room. Now you'll have four or five people complain (if that happens)." 
</P>
<P>
The days of poetry readings are over. But live music can still be heard at 
Rutabegorz on Wednesday nights, when a guitarist and classical musicians 
perform. There is still room for modern art, and chessboards continue to be 
available upon request. 
</P>
<P>
And to his credit, Berkman refuses to bend to trendy changes. "Everything that 
you see today that is changing into Southwestern, or something like that, is 
not lasting," he said. "If you go back to a restaurant that you once identified 
with, today it has totally changed. We have kept the same atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Managing a restaurant has been a learning experience for Berkman. "It has been 
a lot of hard work. Many of the people who helped start the restaurant tired 
quickly when the fun turned to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berkman remembers that in the early years, most of the restaurant pricing 
decisions were made on an emotional basis, without consideration of the 
business's needs. "We would ask ourselves, how much would someone want to pay 
for a cup of coffee; we did this without considering its cost. I have really 
had to develop my business sense in order to keep the restaurant open." 
</P>
<P>
Berkman has not only kept Rutabegorz open, but has opened a second location in 
Tustin. 
</P>
<P>

Lunch Lines 
</P>
<P>
A quick-witted L.A. newscaster and a sweetly proselytizing psychologist 
entertained a lunch bunch at Le Meridien on Tuesday, courtesy of the Spyglass 
Hill Committee of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. About 300 women and 
maybe 10 men attended the $50-per-person benefit, raising an estimated $12,000, 
according to event chairwoman Cathy Udall. Before food and table-side modeling 
of Adrienne Vittadini fashions came two pre-lunch lectures -- first a riotous, 
punch-line-pocked hour from KNBC's Kelly Lange, then a jokey, heart-tug sermon 
by local behaviorist Taylor Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
Intros 
</P>
<P>
First at the podium was Erich Vollmer, executive director of the Philharmonic 
Society, with a Bartlett's-like quote from Emerson -- something about the 
influence of good women. (The luncheon was dubbed "Celebrating Women Today.") 
Next up was Lydia McCroskey, who read an introduction written in rhyming 
couplets, including the verse: "For quality and class we all trust Kelly 
Lange/To start off our program with a megaton bang." 
</P>
<P>
Lange Bang 
</P>
<P>
"Newport Beach -- pul-eeze!" Lange began, sounding more than a little like Joan 
Rivers and launching right into what it takes to be "women today" -- never mind 
the "celebrating." At breakneck speed: "We're bringing up children. We're 
bringing up husbands. We do the hair and the nails and the clothes and the 
exercise, half an hour a day. We asked to be liberated and look at us now: 
We're pooped!" There followed an almost seamless hour of autobiography and 
wickedly funny behind-the-scenes anecdotes from the 19-year-veteran of TV news 
shows. Highlights included: 
</P>
<P>
* An image of Lange in the late '60s beginning her career as a 
helicopter-riding traffic reporter. Her bosses had renamed her Dawn O'Day. 
"Sounds like a stripper, doesn't?" And they made her wear -- in those bad old 
pre-feminism days -- a silver lame jumpsuit. "Can you imagine this? It took six 
men and a boy to get me into that thing every morning." 
</P>
<P>
* An image of Tom Snyder standing on a news desk in Bermuda shorts, full of 
fury, cracking a bull whip while a shocked crew and news staff looked on in 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes into Lange's talk, McCroskey, sitting at a front table, signaled 
that Lange's time was up. "What?" said Lange, not missing a beat. "Please 
finish? Well, I've been thrown out of some pretty good places, but none as good 
as this!" 
</P>

Not to be rushed from a speech going as well as it possibly could, Lange

Next up was O.C.-based psychologist Taylor Hartman, who has written and 
self-published a book called "The Color Code," which categorizes personalities 
as red, blue, white and yellow. Hartman explained his theories with 
generalizations such as, "If you are married to a Red, you're either gorgeous 
or have lots of money." And, "Blues have unrealistic expectations. Nobody gets 
lied to as much as a Blue mother." Toward the end of his 45-minute talk, 
Hartman said: "If you only knew the power of what I just told you, you'd know 
that I came to change your life. If you're humble enough to see it. . . . "

PHOTOGRAPHY: COUNTY FAIR CONTEST OFFERS ENTRANTS A BIG AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A county fair is usually thought of as a place to pet fuzzy critters, eat 
cotton candy and test your endurance on thrill rides. But for local 
photographers, it is an opportunity to compete in the largest photo contest in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Fair photography contest has grown in 15 years from 300 
entries to more than 1,200, and visitor interest in the winners' exhibition has 
increased, according to contest supervisor Russ Williams of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"We have about 70,000 people go through our building," Williams said. "I can't 
think of any museums or art galleries that have that many people (in 12 days). 
Plus there is the possibility of even more people viewing our exhibit because 
over a half-million attend the fair." 
</P>
<P>
The competition is designed for amateurs, Williams says. There are three 
different classes in each division: one for people who have never won a 
contest, one for those who have won two or more awards, and advanced 
photographers who have been consistent winners at the fair. There are also a 
few categories for professionals. 
</P>
<P>
For Williams, a teacher at Mission Viejo High School, overseeing the annual 
contest is his summer job. "I enjoy the contest, and my family has grown up 
with the fair," Williams says. "I have three kids, and they love the whole 
atmosphere. A lot of my photography students work for me at the fair. It's 
really a nice environment." 
</P>
<P>
During his 15 years of supervising the contest, he has seen a tremendous 
increase in the number of novices who enter. 
</P>
<P>
"(With the new cameras), people aren't afraid of photography," Williams said. 
"A lot of people were confused with the idea of f-stops and shutter speeds and 
the technical aspects. Several people who have won big with us have never 
really entered before. They have good cameras that do a lot of the work." 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, the largest category has been commercial processed 
color. The biggest decrease has been in the self-processed black-and-white 
category. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really down," he said. "Black-and-white is a beautiful medium, and it's 
sad to see it go by the wayside. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason is because it's so expensive to print your own black-and-white 
photos. Black-and-white photo paper is more expensive than color. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know what will win because the judging is very subjective. 
Consistently, good photos of young children do very well. The judges do try to 
look for unique things." 
</P>
<P>
The contest is open to Orange County residents, with one slide category open to 
people who live outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
Judging criteria includes sharpness, composition, mounting and retouching. 
</P>
<P>
Selecting a quality photo lab is important for people who are entering the 
commercially processed color category. Williams warns that some labs turn out 
the prints without being too critical of the work; it is important to find a 
quality lab that stands behind its work. 
</P>
<P>
Entry forms must be received for the amateur, junior and professional contest 
by 4 p.m. June 6. The deadline for delivering the entries is June 26. Judging 
takes place July 3, and the entries are returned July 23. The Orange County 
Fair runs from July 11 through July 22. 
</P>
<P>
For more information or to obtain the Competition Handbook entry forms, call 
the Orange County Fair office at (714) 751-3247. 
</P>
<P>
The Photography column, which runs Saturdays in Orange County Life, is intended 
to help both the serious amateur and weekend shooter.

THEY HOLD ON TO WIN BY A HARE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: NO TORTOISES, THE 76ERS NEARLY OVERCOME ANOTHER LAKER FAST 
START/SLOW FINISH BEFORE L.A. WINS, 122-116. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Their habitual second-half lulls had become quite irksome as a topic of 
conversation among the Lakers. But they still seem incapable of preventing 
them, perhaps because they usually win anyway. 
</P>
<P>
It happened again Friday night against the Philadelphia 76ers but, this time, 
the Lakers were in no mood to dwell on the negative. They just seemed so happy 
-- no, relieved -- to finally put away the 76ers, 122-116, before 17,505 at the 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by 23 points and shooting nearly 70% early in the third quarter, the 
Lakers entered another prolonged slump, from which they barely emerged in time. 
</P>
<P>
That, too, is another Laker habit, which might be why they are not overly 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"It happens," Magic Johnson said. "Right now, I'm not going to worry about it. 
If it continues on, I'll worry. We've just got to kick it up a gear." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, another victory was all that really mattered to the Lakers, who 
improved their NBA-best record to 40-12. The Laker victory, combined with 
Portland's loss to the Chicago Bulls, increased the Lakers' Pacific Division 
lead to 3 1/2 games over the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' level of concern equaled the quality of competition. They were 
angry Wednesday night, when they blew most of a 14-point lead at Denver and won 
by two points. Friday, however, they lost an even more significant lead to the 
34-20 76ers, one of the NBA's hottest teams. 
</P>
<P>
While it may seem like quibbling, one Laker -- center Mychal Thompson -- said 
he is concerned about the day when the Lakers lose a big lead and do not 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting ridiculous now, the way we blow double-digit leads," said 
Thompson, who suffered a sprained ankle during the fourth quarter but continued 
playing. "We're getting complacent out there. There's no excuse for a veteran 
team like this to let that happen time and again. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't stop it soon, it's going to come up and kick us in the butt. When 
you run the 100-meter sprint, you don't want to cross the finish line walking 
with your back to it." 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers cut the Laker lead to four points with 5:10 to play and pulled to 
four again with five seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
But Coach Pat Riley, who has publicly fretted about the Lakers' habit of 
blowing leads, was satisfied by his team's effort. He said it was nearly 
impossible for the Lakers to maintain their torrid first-half pace. Thus, he 
felt Philadelphia's second-half resurgence, led by Charles Barkley and Derek 
Smith, was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great win," Riley said. "I never felt like we'd lose the game. When 
it got to four points, it gave us something to think about. But I don't think 
there has been a big lead this year when we haven't lost part of it. That 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we were going to lose was if we quit, and I knew that wasn't 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Laker transformation from world beater to Team Vulnerable did not begin 
immediately. They played about as well as they are capable in the first half, 
making 69.7% of their shots to take a 67-51 lead. Their fast break was in full 
throttle, and Byron Scott scored 21 points -- most from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
But after seven consecutive points in the first 1:11 of the third quarter gave 
the Lakers a 23-point lead, they watched it slowly dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley scored 20 of his game-high 32 points in the second half. But the prime 
mover for the 76ers was Smith, who had 15 points and resembled the shooting 
guard he was before suffering a knee injury with the Clippers, circa 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
At one point early in the fourth quarter, Smith scored seven consecutive points 
-- enabling the 76ers to pull to seven points with 8:17 to play. The 76ers 
pulled to 109-105 when Ron Anderson made a jump shot with 5:10 to play. 
</P>
<P>
That is when Johnson emerged. He made two free throws with 5:00 minutes left, 
then sank a three-point shot with 4:19 left to make the Laker lead 114-105. 
</P>
<P>
But the 76ers would not yield, and Johnson needed to strike again. He made a 
three-point play with 1:37 left, then another drive with 1:17 left for a 
120-112 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia made another run, but the Lakers had pulled through again. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had a right to be happy with the victory, regardless of what 
transpired in the second half. They made 58% of their shots. A.C. Green scored 
24 points and had eight rebounds. Scott finished with 24 points, all but two in 
the first half. And, Johnson had 22 points and 17 assists. 
</P>
<P>
It was a combination of Laker fatigue and a change of 76er strategy that 
contributed to the second-half turnaround. The half-court trap the 76ers threw 
at the Lakers failed in the first half, because the Lakers were able to make 
their outside shots. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Coach Jim Lynam basically abandoned the trap and went to a 
more conventional double-team on the ball. And the 76ers became the offensive 
aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually, teams that are down a whole bunch of points tend to give up," Lynam 
said. "But we came out in the second half and made it a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
That is the Lakers' point. Most of the players felt it unfair to lump Friday's 
blown lead into the same category as Wednesday's blown lead against Denver or 
last-week's blown lead at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Give them credit," Johnson said. "They are a good team. They can capitalize on 
any situation. We played a good game to beat them. We just had that stretch 
where we hit nothing. We were just missing shots. It was different than Denver. 
We made turnovers (in Denver), and then you're upset. Tonight, we just didn't 
hit the shots." 
</P>
<P>
Said Riley: "It wasn't so much a letdown on our part this time. They were 
hitting the threes. Derek Smith went off on us. Ron Anderson went off, and 
Charles kept banging away. It just happens. It's hard to maintain that type of 
lead against that type of team." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Cooper, in his first game back after hitting his head on a metal stair 
while diving for the ball in San Antonio on Tuesday night, played eight minutes 
in the first half before sitting out the rest of the game because of a sore 
neck related to his fall. . . . The Lakers have 10 consecutive victories 
against the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy said his severely bruised right shoulder makes playing painful. 
"As long as it doesn't get hit during the game, it's OK," Worthy said. "But it 
gets hit every time I go through the lane." During timeouts, Worthy applies a 
heating pack on his shoulder. "Mostly, to keep (the shoulder) loose. I don't 
want it to get stiff." 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac's English has improved enough so that he now can sing the national 
anthem. "I've known the words for two or three weeks," he said. Divac paused, 
then added: "I know last word -- freeeee." Divac says he wants to teach 
teammates Mark McNamara the Yugoslav anthem. McNamara has been learning 
Serbo-Croatian, Divac's native tongue, this season and now can converse with 
Divac in two languages. 
</P>
<P>
The starting time of the Lakers' game at Denver on April 8 has been changed 
from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., at the Nuggets' request. . . . The Lakers are off today 
and will play the Utah Jazz on Sunday night at the Forum.

LOYOLA CLINCHES CONFERENCE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Westhead could hardly decide what to celebrate first Friday night. His 
Loyola Marymount team defeated San Diego, 131-119, to clinch the West Coast 
Conference title before a crowd of 4,156 in Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
The victory made the Lions the top-seeded team in the conference tournament. 
The Lions will face last-place Gonzaga next Saturday in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, which raised Loyola's record to 21-5 overall and 12-1 in the WCC, 
was also Westhead's 100th in his fifth season at the school. Loyola tied its 
NCAA record with its 23rd 100-point game of the season and tied another of its 
records by having three players score more than 30 points each. Bo Kimble had a 
game-high 43 points. Hank Gathers had 35 and Jeff Fryer 33. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, it was Westhead's 27th wedding anniversary. A dilemma? "Not 
even close," Westhead said with a grin. "You know it's 27 years." 
</P>
<P>
While Westhead could toss out one-liners, San Diego Coach Hank Egan could only 
consider what might have been. The Toreros shot 53%, outrebounded the Lions, 
54-39, and were within 117-115 with 2:55 to play and a chance to tie. 
</P>
<P>
But with the Toreros moving the ball upcourt, Loyola forward Per Stumer 
intercepted a pass near the sideline and found Kimble for a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
After San Diego's John Jerome scored, the Lions missed a shot but Stumer went 
up in a crowd and volleyballed the ball to Fryer, who swished his ninth 
three-point basket. That ended San Diego's threat. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros, 14-11 overall, fell to 9-4 in the WCC and go into Pepperdine 
tonight in a second-place tie with the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it a good old try. I thought we might take (a victory) out of here 
when it was two points," Egan said. "That was a tough turnover at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola made 13 of 21 three-point shots. Pat Holbert led six San Diego players 
in double figures with a career-high 27. Jerome added 23 and a game-high 11 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
With Fryer scoring the game's first eight points and Loyola playing an active 
press, the Lions sped to a 24-12 lead and appeared on the verge of putting the 
Toreros away early. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego kept its composure, had a 32-20 rebounding edge in the half and 
began chipping away at the lead, led by the outside shooting of Holbert. San 
Diego pulled to within a point on a basket by Holbert, then took a 40-38 lead 
on a Holbert three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola grabbed the lead back 10 seconds later on a three-point shot by Fryer, 
who had six in the half on the way to 20 points. The Lions hit 10 of 14 
three-point attempts in the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions took a 57-52 lead into the final minutes of the half, but San Diego 
scored the next eight points for its biggest lead, 60-57, with two minutes to 
go. In the final nine seconds of the half, San Diego missed three consecutive 
free throws, and Loyola took a 64-62 halftime lead on a drive through the lane 
and a dunk by Kimble to beat the buzzer. Kimble also had 20 points at the 
break. Holbert had 13 to lead the Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
Holbert opened the second half with a quick basket to tie the score and the 
teams were tied again, 75-75, but the Toreros could never quite get over the 
hump, though they stayed close. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions built leads of eight and nine points midway through the second half 
but San Diego pulled to within 108-107 with 4:30 to play. Kimble immediately 
answered with a three-point play, but San Diego was within two points two 
minutes later when Holbert scored his last basket, making it 117-115. 
</P>
<P>
That was when Stumer made his big plays. "Per had a couple smart end-of-game 
plays," Westhead said. "We call that one (where he batted the ball) the Swedish 
tip." 
</P>
<P>
Stumer, a native of Sweden, said: "I have a problem (rebounding) against the 
high-jumping guys, so when I can't grab it I try to tip it. Every once in a 
while it helps." 
</P>
<P>
Of his steal, he said Westhead forecast where the San Diego pass would be. 
"They'd been running that play all game," Stumer said. "I was waiting back 
there for it, got a hand on it and saw Bo on the break." 
</P>
<P>
The 22nd-ranked Lions were coming off last week's defeat at Pepperdine 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys the sign of a good team is how you play after a loss," 
Westhead said. "We'll try to finish as strong as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Egan has more immediate worries. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have learned to compete," he said. "We didn't execute that well, but 
we competed. It's important that we go out of here with our heads up and get 
ready (for Pepperdine)."

MELVIN DURSLAG: U.S. GETS NO KICK FROM SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Performing in soccer the other night amid the historic splendor of the Los 
Angeles Coliseum, whose preservation exceeds in importance that of any of the 
great pyramids, the Soviet Union and Colombia drew only 18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, one was dealing here with box office nations, appearing in the news 
almost as much as the Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
And now, as before, one inspecting attendance was led to ask oneself that 
question of vital sociological concern -- why won't U.S. spectators go for 
soccer? 
</P>
<P>
Soccer is an excellent game, appreciated by viewers the planet over. If 
something exists that may be called the true international sport, it would be 
soccer. Its World Cup enjoys status of an athletic classic. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the effort of soccer to establish a beachhead in the United 
States, whatever arguments made in the game's behalf, soccer has lost its 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
And, professionally today, the sport here is reduced to an endeavor labeled 
indoor soccer, performed under a roof on a short field flanked by plexiglass 
boards, off which the ball can be played on the carom, as in jai alai. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas standard soccer features 11 to a side, indoor calls for six. And if you 
wonder idly what an indoor participant looks like, be assured he comes with one 
head, two arms, two legs and the usual number of fingers and toes. 
</P>
<P>
The indoor league, once comprising 12 teams, is down to eight, struggling to 
keep its pulse in the tradition of any form of pro soccer in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced in 1967 that outdoor soccer stood on the doorsill of greatness in 
North America, promoters put together two leagues, consisting of 22 teams. Such 
confidence was vested in the sport that the rival leagues, amazingly, 
overlapped in five cities. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, for instance, was the home of the Toros and the Zorros, the latter 
owned by Jack Kent Cooke, who exclaimed rapturously: "What a marvelous game! Do 
you realize you can outfit a whole soccer team for what it costs to dress one 
football player?" 
</P>
<P>
Making sure he had a place large enough to accommodate the throngs, Jack booked 
his games in the Rose Bowl, capacity 106,000. Opening night, he looked 
wistfully at a Zorro audience of 1,251. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros selected as home the L.A. Coliseum, capacity 93,000. Asked by a 
sportswriter for two tickets to the opener, the publicist responded, "How about 
a section?" 
</P>
<P>
If one got into a soccer deal, who needed Lincoln Savings? 
</P>
<P>
Feeling it had found the Lost Dutchman mine, CBS came aboard, blowing an 
immense amount of money in putting the games on the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those who like soccer still aren't able to believe they have on their hands in 
this country a spectator disaster. The game, they argue, has a massive base, 
stemming from 8,000,000 amateurs who are playing the sport at levels ranging 
from 4-year-olds to the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, soccer boosters insist, identify with the pro players, who are average in 
appearance. They don't weigh 275. They don't rise 7 feet. They have the teeth 
they came with. 
</P>
<P>
When the late Abe Saperstein formed the American Basketball League, he promised 
to put players on the floor of normal height. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is sick of looking at freaks," announced Abe, who, crashing with 
his league, misread public taste. 
</P>
<P>
Are soccer players too normal for the game's good? 
</P>
<P>
Those trying to explain why the sport can't build a flame in American hearts 
usually begin by noting that soccer bucks baseball, and is judged by football. 
</P>
<P>
Will fans accustomed to watching the 49ers move the ball sit still for a Soviet 
Union-Colombia match the other night, ending 1-0 with a penalty kick in 
overtime? 
</P>
<P>
In soccer, 1-0 can be a slugfest. The Netherlands and Italy, two of the world's 
top teams, played to a scoreless draw earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
Then it has been asked whether Americans reject soccer because teams here have 
featured too many foreigners? Well, baseball brims with Dominicans, Puerto 
Ricans, Cubans and Panamanians, and the only ones rejected are those who hit 
.210. 
</P>
<P>
But, for all its reversals in the United States, soccer remains hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the Wichita Wings assured us one day: "It's just a 
matter of getting our foot in the American door. We have a fast, lively 
product. Our players are appealing. They don't wear pads, helmets, or face 
masks. And the ball is easier to follow than a puck." 
</P>
<P>
It even may be easier to follow than a horse on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
Soccer makes a compelling argument. All it has to do is sell it to those who 
don't buy its tickets.

<P>
If she had her way, PattiSue Plumer would not have competed Friday night at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
She is taking the bar exam Tuesday, and has been suffering from a cold for a 
week. The Mobil Grand Prix Indoor Track and Field Championships was the 
furthest thing on her mind. 
</P>
<P>
She had no choice. As an athlete funded by The Athletics Congress, she was 
committed to the national governing body's indoor meet. When Plumer asked to be 
excused, she was told her reasons were not valid. 
</P>
<P>
She thought that was unfair, but was not about to relinquish her $800 a month 
stipend for being one of America's best distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
So all Plumer did was start quickly and turn the women's 3,000 meters into the 
meet's best race, finishing second to Lynn Jennings of Newmarket, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings set a U.S. indoor record with a time of 8 minutes 40.45 seconds, 
followed by Plumer in 8:41.45 and Vickie Huber of Philadelphia in 8:42.13. All 
were faster than the previous mark of 8:44.68, set by Lesley Lahane in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, who also finished second in the mile, does not believe the rule forcing 
TAC's elite athletes to compete in its major events is applied evenly. 
</P>
<P>
She was not the only runner upset with the TAC Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Scott, finishing the mile and his indoor season impressively, thought he 
won until learning that the finish tape was not really the finish. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? So was Scott, who discovered the discrepancy after a victory lap in 
front of an appreciative crowd of 11,849. Instead of winning, he ended in a 
dead heat with Marcus O'Sullivan of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to have the finish at the finish line," Scott said. "It is a false 
sense of where the finish line is, and that is the fault of TAC." 
</P>
<P>
Scott, of Encinitas, and O'Sullivan were timed in 3:57.35. Neither could 
remember a tie in a mile, at least not in such an important meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Steve had won it," O'Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was told that the tape was six inches ahead of the actual finish line, 
O'Sullivan changed his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The reason the tape is not the true finish is because it would interfere with 
the automatic photo timer, said TAC official Howard Schmertz. 
</P>
<P>
After officials examined a photograph of the finish, they concurred that the 
runners were even. 
</P>
<P>
Scott and O'Sullivan contended that most races have light strings to designate 
the finish, but Schmertz disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Scott lost $2,000 in prize money because of the official result. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a little cheated," said Scott, whose sprint in the last 100 yards 
caught O'Sullivan on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many lines out there you don't know where the finish is. You need 
to use a tape as a judge." 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, who lives in Mountain View, Calif., and recently finished law school at 
Stanford, was not worried about her finishes. 
</P>
<P>
Or her starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to run," she said. "If I had done well or poorly, it would have 
been a distraction." 
</P>
<P>
After a personal record in the 3,000, Plumer got into the spirit of 
competition. Against her coach's best wishes, she jumped into the mile race. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked over and the race was about to go off," she said. "I said, 'Well, why 
not try.' " 
</P>
<P>
She was not strong enough to challenge Romania's Doina Melinte, who won in 
4:27.62. Plumer finished second to the indoor record-holder in 4:31.29. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Kingdom, the world record-holder in the 110-meter hurdles, lost in a 
stunning upset to Tony Dees and Arthur Blake in the 55-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Dees, who is training at the University of Tampa in Florida, started in the 
second lane and pulled away from the field. That sounds more like the way 
Kingdom destroys his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Dees' winning time of 7.03 seconds was just ahead of Blake in 7.09. Kingdom was 
at 7.12, followed by Tonie Campbell in 7.16. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stuck in the (starting blocks) box again," Kingdom said. "But I have to 
give Tony credit, he ran an excellent race." 
</P>
<P>
In the meet's other outstanding performance, Hollis Conway won the high jump in 
7 feet 8 1/2 inches, an event record. Conway held off Romania's Sorin Matei who 
cleared 7-7 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Track Notes 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cooper of Florida, winner of the 55-meter dash, has suffered through one 
personal drama after another. In June, he chipped a bone in his foot. In 
September, his girlfriend, Krisden Tanuve was murdered in Huntington Beach when 
a former lover fatally shot her and then himself. In November, his mother 
suffered a heart attack. Then he reinjured his foot. "I only had two weeks of 
practice, I knew what was ahead of me," he said.

John McEnroe's appeal of his disqualification from the Australian Open and 
$6,500 in fines was rejected Friday by the International Tennis Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Federation spokesman Ian Barnes said all the evidence surrounding McEnroe's 
fourth-round disqualification in Melbourne, Australia, had been studied by 
Grand Slam tournament administrator Bill Babcock. 
</P>
<P>
Under federation rules, any player accruing fines of $7,500 within a 12-month 
period automatically is banned from the next Grand Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes emphasized that Friday's decision applies only to Grand Slam events. 
McEnroe still could accrue fines at regular Assn. of Tennis Professionals 
tournaments, and not have to miss any of the Grand Slam events. The next Grand 
Slam event will be the French Open, beginning in May. Wimbledon begins in June.

SELES STOPS SHRIVER IN WASHINGTON

Monica Seles, who said her hands were shaking, turned back a belated comeback 
bid by Pam Shriver to advance to the semifinals of the Virginia Slims of 
Washington Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Seles won, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), after holding a 5-2 lead in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, who lives in nearby Landover, Md., fought off four match points and 
won four consecutive games to go ahead, 6-5. But Seles, seeded third, then held 
serve at love before winning the final three points of the tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just chickening out," said Seles, who never had played Shriver. "I 
couldn't hit the ball, I was so scared. My hands were shaking." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Seles will Martina Navratilova, who defeated Anne Smith, 6-4, 6-2. 
Navratilova is 19-1 against Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Other quarterfinal winners were Zina Garrison, who beat Nathalie Tauziat of 
Francis, 6-0, 7-6 (7-4), and Natalia Zvereva, who defeated Nicole Provis of 
Australia, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Petr Korda won 11 of the last 12 points to defeat fourth-seeded Jay Berger, 7-6 
(7-5), 6-1, in the U.S. Pro Indoor at Philadelphia. All of the top six seeded 
players have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Pete Sampras defeated fifth-seeded Tim Mayotte for the third time this 
year, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3; Mark Kratzmann overcame sharp muscle pain to defeat 
eighth-seeded Jim Courier, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9-7); and seventh-seeded Andres Gomez 
served 12 aces to stop Paul Haarhuis, 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (3-7), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh victory in as many days for Kratzmann, who had to enter 
through a qualifying tournament. In the semifinals, Sampras will play 
Kratzmann. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, ranked No. 1 in the world, beat Patrick Kuenhen of West Germany, 
6-3, 6-3, to reach the semifinals of the ATP Eurocard tournament at Stuttgart, 
West Germany. Boris Becker, seeded second, defeated Miloslav Mecir of 
Czechoslovakia, 6-4, 6-2.

ANGEL EXHIBITION SERIES REPORTEDLY OFF

<P>
The Angels' opening series of spring training against the San Diego Padres in 
Yuma, Ariz., will be canceled, according to sources who declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Even though negotiators for baseball's players and owners will continue to meet 
through the weekend in New York, several sources said Friday that it's too late 
to save the first four games in Yuma March 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
Yuma Mayor Bob Tippett said the lost series will cost the city about $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it's something we anticipated," Tippett said. "It's too bad, 
because we had the Saturday and Sunday games (March 3-4) sold out. We just hope 
it doesn't get any worse." 
</P>
<P>
Although no one has provided a specific timetable for spring training should 
there be an agreement, several baseball officials said Friday that they have 
been advised it will take at least 12 days after a settlement before games are 
played. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner's office has informed clubs that players will be allowed at 
least five days, but probably a week, to report to camp once a settlement is 
reached. Then there is the matter of practice time before a game can be 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"The general rule of thumb is that they will be given 10 days of practice time 
before playing games," said Jack McKeon, Padre manager and vice 
president/baseball operations. "That could be shortened by a couple of days, 
but that's about it."

Arkansas ended Texas' 132-game Southwest Conference winning streak in women's 
basketball by winning, 82-77, at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Juliet Jackson made six free throws late in the second half as 25th-ranked 
Arkansas (21-3 overall, 14-1 conference) handed the sixth-ranked Lady Longhorns 
(20-4, 13-1) their first SWC loss since the conference began formal competition 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Texas actually had won 183 consecutive games against SWC opponents dating to 
Jan. 23, 1978, when the Lady Longhorns lost to Texas A&amp;M, 59-52. The league 
didn't sanction women's sports until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Said Texas coach Jody Conradt: "It hurts, and it's going to hurt more in the 
morning. We have taken pride in the streak. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had to happen, I am glad it happened at home and not on the road where 
we would have felt alone," Conradt said.

ROCCO MEDIATE MAKING A NAME FOR HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time we get this straight. Rocco Mediate's name is pronounced wrong much 
too often. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a thousand different versions," Mediate said. 
</P>
<P>
The first name is simple -- Rocco, as in Rocky. And yes, he is from 
Pennsylvania. Not Philadelphia, but Greensburg. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he even looks a little like Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia, who is also 
from Pennsylvania -- Upper Darby. 
</P>
<P>
And the last name is Mediate, as in mee-dee-ate. Long A. Not meditate, as it is 
often pronounced. And not the Italian pronunciation -- Mee-dee-ah-tay -- even 
though he is Italian. His grandfather's name was also Rocco. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Mediate by itself would be OK, but when you put Rocco in front of it, 
it makes it hard," Mediate's wife, Linda, said Friday as she watched her 
husband shoot a four-under 67 in the second round in the L. A. Open at Rivera 
Country Club. He finished at 10 under, in second place, a stroke off the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The name used to be pronounced the Italian way, but somewhere along the line 
it got changed," she said. "But Rocco says he wants to be known for his golf, 
anyway, not his name." 
</P>
<P>
Even the officials here at the prestigious Riviera Country Club can't get it 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have heard the guy announce him yesterday," said Dave Stockton, who 
was grouped with Mediate for the first two rounds. "Then he says Rocco is from 
Pontro Verdo. At least he got the Florida part right." 
</P>
<P>
That's Ponte Vedra, Fla., where Mediate lives now. But what he's called doesn't 
really matter to him. What he cares about is how he is playing -- and right 
now, he's playing well. 
</P>
<P>
This is Mediate's fifth year on the tour. In his first four years, he made a 
total of $395,099. His best finish was a tie for second at the 1987 Provident 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly, his rise to prominence began a few weeks ago at the Pebble Beach 
National Pro-Am, where he was a stroke off the lead after three rounds, but he 
faltered with a 77 on the final day. 
</P>
<P>
His goal was to finish in the top 10. He finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
But it was his experience at Pebble Beach that Mediate said helped his game the 
most. As one of the leaders, he was paired with Mark O'Meara, who won the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"O'Meara just went out and played consistent, and Rocco realized that you don't 
have to perform miracles on every hole to win a tournament, you just have to be 
consistent," Linda Mediate said. 
</P>
<P>
"His attitude is better, also. Some of the guys have the feeling that they 
don't belong playing with the big guys, the winners. But Rocco feels now that 
he can be up there with the others. He says there's no more messing around." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate said Pebble Beach also taught him not to be afraid to lead a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"The last three years, I didn't want to get in this position (the lead) because 
I was afraid," Mediate said. "Everyone is looking at you and all. But I'm not 
afraid anymore. Because of Pebble, I knew that I could get here." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate shot a 65 Thursday and began the second round two strokes off the lead. 
He birdied the first hole, then two-putted on each of the next six holes to 
stay at seven under. He sank a 10-foot putt on No. 8 for a birdie that put him 
eight under. 
</P>
<P>
On the backside, he birdied 10 and 17, finishing at 10 under for the 
tournament, a 67 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I had fun today," Mediate said. "I'm hitting as good as I ever have." 
</P>
<P>
That is perhaps the best thing about watching Mediate, he looks as though he is 
having fun. 
</P>
<P>
And, he's approachable. Before he teed off Friday, he signed autographs and 
shook hands with the fans flocking around the practice putting green. In his 
baggy pants and oversized golf shirt, the 6-foot-1, 200-pound Mediate appeared 
relaxed, tranquil. 
</P>
<P>
His goal, Mediate said, is to get to the top in golf, and then see how he 
performs. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do have the lead, I have to learn to play with it," he said. "I'm not out 
here to finish 30th every week. I do it a lot, but I just want to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate, 27, did not start playing golf until he was 16. He said a few of his 
friends were playing, so he decided to give it a shot. He was at Florida 
Southern University when his game improved, "when I was about 20," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Mediate's golfing days, he spent his time pitching baseballs. His 
father, Anthony Mediate, was a minor league pitcher in the Pittsburgh Pirate 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a decent player, but I don't know if I would have been any good," 
Mediate said. 
</P>
<P>
In golf, he doesn't have to wonder.

Beth Daniel made four consecutive birdies on the back nine Friday to open a 
two-stroke lead after two rounds of the Hawaiian Ladies Open at Honolulu. 
</P>

Daniel, with 18 LPGA Tour victories, had six birdies and one bogey for a 
five-under-par 67 on the firm greens of the new 6,206-yard Ko Olina Golf Club 
course on Oahu's west shore.

Amy Benz was two strokes back after shooting a 70. First-round co-leader Elaine 
Crosby, defending champion Sherri Turner and Judy Dickinson were three strokes 
back. Crosby had a 72, Turner a 71 and Dickinson a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel started the day two strokes behind Crosby, Cathy Gerring and Patty 
Sheehan. But Sheehan shot a 73 to drop four strokes back with DeeDee Lasker, 
Lori Poling and Hiromi Kobayashi of Japan. Gerring dropped to even-par for the 
tournament with a 75.

Guards Kevin Ollie and Alexous Scruggs combined to score 50 points, but it took 
four points in overtime from senior center David Washington to give Crenshaw 
High School a 91-90 victory over Reseda Cleveland in a City Section 4-A 
Division semifinal boys' basketball game Friday at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Washington cost the Cougars a victory in regulation when he missed two 
uncontested layups. 
</P>
<P>
But in the overtime period, his inside scoring proved to be the difference as 
the defending City and State champions advanced to the City final for the third 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I missed in regulation, everyone told me that they knew that I'd come 
back," said Washington, whose overtime points accounted for his only scoring. 
"I just tried to go up strong with the ball in overtime." 
</P>
<P>
Washington finished off what teammates Ollie and Scruggs set up for Crenshaw. 
Ollie, a junior, scored 17 points in the second half, and Scruggs, a sophomore, 
scored 11 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (21-6) was led by senior guard Eddie Hill, who scored 24 points, 
including 14 in the fourth and overtime periods. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw (22-4) will play Manual Arts in the final for the third consecutive 
season next Friday at the Sports Arena. LONNIE WHITE

Manual Arts 72, Dorsey 48 -- Marcell Capers scored 19 points and Dwain 
Bradberry added 16 to lead the top-seeded Toilers in the other 4-A semifinal at 
the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts outscored Dorsey, 24-9, in the second quarter, with Capers and 
Bradberry combining for 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Toilers (24-4) had a distinct advantage in the backcourt. Dorsey's starting 
guards, Kareem Sconiers and Tim Cage, managed only 13 points, with Cage scoring 
nearly half of that total in the game's final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The big court hurt Dorsey more than it hurt us," Manual Arts Coach Randolph 
Simpson said. "We have big guards who can cover more area. We wore Dorsey down, 
and a guy like Marcell (Capers) took over." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said he is looking forward to facing Crenshaw in the final once again. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody wrote us off at the beginning of the season, but our goal was to get 
to the City final," Simpson said. "Now that we're there, we will face Crenshaw, 
but this year should be different because we are deeper."

STANFORD GRABS EARLY LEAD; UCLA IN THIRD, USC FIFTH

Stanford got off to a fast start by winning three of five events Friday at the 
Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championships at East Los Angeles 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal leads California, 519 to 376. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is third at 340, Arizona State fourth at 304 and USC is fifth at 236. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Stanford senior Katie Connors won the one-meter springboard diving 
event at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Connor edged UCLA freshman Kristen Walls, 410.85 to 409.65. Because the East L. 
A. pool has no diving facilities, those events are being held at USC. The 
three-meter springboard finals are today at 1:30 p.m. and the 10-meter platform 
is Sunday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford took up where Connors left off. After Cal won the 200-yard freestyle 
relay, the Cardinal depth took over. Janet Evans led four Stanford swimmers in 
the championship final of the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:43.74. In the 
next event, the 200-yard individual medley, Stanford swimmers placed first, 
third, fifth, sixth and seventh, led by freshman Janel Jorgensen in 2:02.81. 
Teri O'Laughlin of USC was second in 2:03.67. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Stoudt of UCLA won the 50-yard freestyle with an NCAA qualifying time of 
23.36 to give the Bruins their only victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-10 men's diving championship started as UCLA sophomore Chris Dudka won 
the three-meter springboard. He defeated USC's Brian Earley, 551.40 to 527.05.

Another massive slide in stock prices Friday on the Tokyo exchange sent 
financial jitters around the globe as investors reacted to the possibility of 
the Japanese selling their substantial international investments and thus 
sending stock prices into a tailspin worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
But securities experts question whether the Japanese market, which has fallen 
6.9% in the past week, really has that much influence on investors in the 
United States and other Western industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be some kind of joint knee-jerk reaction, but the long-term trends 
in various equity markets are really dependent on trends in the individual 
economies," said Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative analysis at Merrill 
Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction in many countries was substantial, however. Share prices 
in Britain, France, West Germany, Switzerland, South Africa and Hong Kong all 
fell more than 1% following the 935.87-point, or 2.6%, drop in Tokyo's 
225-share Nikkei index Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The decline capped a dismal week in Japan, where the Nikkei tumbled 2,569 
points to close at 34,890.97 amid worries that interest rates would continue to 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks become less attractive when interest rates rise because investors can 
earn more from government bonds and bank deposits. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Nikkei index's decline had little effect in the United States, 
where the Dow Jones industrial index closed at 2,564.19, down only 10.58 
points, or 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. market experts had been concerned that a steep decline in the Nikkei index 
would be echoed by the Dow for two reasons. The Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 
dramatically after the Wall Street crash of 1987, which was taken as a sign 
that in today's global economy all stock exchanges are linked. Second, there 
were worries that if the Japanese exchange were to suffer a major decline, 
investors might be persuaded to sell their overseas holdings and reinvest at 
home. That could hurt both the U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are few recent statistics, the Japanese are believed to be 
substantial holders of U.S. Treasury bonds as well as corporate stocks. 
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese pulled out of the bond market, it is possible that the U.S. 
government would have to raise interest rates in order to attract new buyers 
for its debt. This, in turn, would put strong downward pressure on stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The underlying concern is that when something happens in a stock market, it 
frightens people, and frightened people sell stocks," said Gail Dudack, vice 
president and market strategist at S. G. Warburg &amp; Co. in New York. "If 
something happens to frighten people in Japan, they might sell stock all over 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
Last week's trading activity did a great deal to quell those fears because the 
U.S. market did not react violently to the problems in Japan, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"As the Japanese market has shown its fragility, U.S. prices have held up very 
well," said Alan R. Ackerman, market strategist for Grunthal &amp; Co. "We are 
not held hostage to the Japanese, but we are clearly concerned about what they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, analysts maintain that the effect of the Japanese on the U.S. stock 
market may be less substantial than previously imagined. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors owned only about 6.3% of U.S. companies' stock outstanding in 
early 1989, Dudack said. Additionally, although the Japanese habitually snap up 
close to one-third of the U.S. debt sold at Treasury auctions, they also often 
resell the bonds, said John Hickling, portfolio manager of the Fidelity 
International Growth &amp; Income Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Still, investors may see further declines in both U.S. and Japanese stock 
prices, even though the two exchanges are clearly not trading in tandem. Both 
countries, after all, are experiencing some of the same woes -- namely, 
deteriorating corporate profits and rising interest rates, Hickling said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese rates for 10-year government bonds have jumped about 1 percentage 
point since year-end 1989, to 6.8%, and U.S. rates have risen a similar amount 
and now yield about 8.5%, said Joseph Wahed, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors fear that further increases could be in the offing since the 
Bank of Japan has said it intends to tighten credit in order to quell 
inflation, added Rod Swanson, senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporate profits are suffering in both countries and are expected 
to remain lackluster throughout 1990.

Sweden's car maker Volvo and the French state-owned automotive concern Renault 
said Friday that they intend to make sizable investments in each other to try 
to make both companies more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made during a news conference in Amsterdam, capped a year of 
negotiations between the two companies, whose sales have been under pressure in 
an increasingly competitive world market. 
</P>
<P>
Volvo has been suffering from the slump on the previously profitable U.S. 
market for European auto sales, while Renault is rapidly losing ground to the 
Japanese at the top end of the market. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the equity investments, the companies said they intended to 
enter into an "extensive cooperation agreement" under which they would 
coordinate elements of product development, purchasing and investment plans. 
</P>
<P>
But they said each company would maintain its independent identity, trademarks 
and distribution organizations and would continue assembling and marketing its 
own cars, trucks and buses. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the companies would exchange a 45% interest in their 
respective truck and bus divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for Renault to become a limited company in which AB Volvo would 
acquire through a special issue 20% of the shares and an option to obtain 
another 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Renault, at the same time, would acquire a 25% share of the Volvo car 
operation. Moreover, Renault intends to buy a 10% interest in AB Volvo, the 
parent company of the Swedish industrial giant. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the transactions was estimated at about $4.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is subject to French government approval, but Raymond Levy, Renault's 
chairman and chief executive, said, "I wouldn't be here if I hadn't been sure 
about the position of my government." 
</P>
<P>
Volvo President Pehr Gyllenhammar told reporters that the move "will give (the 
companies) the size, breadth and depth well above the critical mass necessary 
to survive in this fiercely competitive industry." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Volvo and Renault will maintain their headquarters in Goteborg, 
Sweden, and Paris, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
But he did not rule out the eventual development of a joint new model. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedish-French agreement was expected to have far-reaching consequences for 
the auto market in the European Economic Community, also known as the EEC. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the EEC Commission, the Community's executive body, said it would 
review the proposed deal to assess its impact on competition in the European 
Community motor vehicle market. 
</P>
<P>
A Commission spokesman said the it had been told informally several months ago 
that talks were under way between Renault and Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new law that takes effect Sept. 21, major mergers in the 12-nation 
Community must be submitted to the Commission for prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimated that the Volvo and Renault companies would produce about 2 
million vehicles a year, or about 20% of the European market. 
</P>
<P>
The companies would produce more than 140,000 trucks, beating the current 
leader in that field, Daimler Benz of West Germany, by about 25,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the latest year for which complete figures were available, Renault 
more than doubled its net profit to 8.913 billion francs, or $1.59 billion, 
from 3.689 billion, or $658 million, the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the French company manufactured more than 1.6 million passenger cars 
and 80,250 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Volvo had an operating profit of 4.06 billion Swedish crowns, or $676 million, 
for the first nine months of 1989, down 14%.

DELTA PLANS SHARP INCREASE IN L.A.-S.F. SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE CARRIER HOPES TO FILL A VOID LEFT BY AMERICAN'S PULLBACK. USAIR 
SAYS IT WILL END ALL LONG BEACH FLIGHTS.

<P>
Delta Air Lines will greatly expand its presence in the hotly contested air 
corridor between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the airline said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, USAir said it will abandon all of its flights in and out of the Long 
Beach airport at the beginning of May because of lack of business. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning June 1, Delta said, it will operate 16 round-trip flights a day -- 
more than five times the three flights it now operates on the route. The 
flights will leave hourly. 
</P>
<P>
"Western Air Lines (which Delta acquired four years ago) had similar-type 
service before our merger," Al Kolakowski, Atlanta-based Delta's vice 
president-sales, said in a telephone interview. "But we put it aside to 
allocate our equipment elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been part of our long-range growth plan to get back in the market, and 
the time is appropriate now," Kolakowski said. "When we go into a route, we 
stay there. This is a long-term commitment. We know this is a tough market. 
There is a lot of capacity, but on a level playing field we think we can have 
an impact in the market." 
</P>
<P>
The Delta action follows by a month United Airlines' announcement that it would 
boost its service between Los Angeles and San Francisco to a flight every half 
hour between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Observers said the added competition could mean a drop in fares. At the moment, 
according to Delta, fares range from $136 one way for an advance purchase 
ticket to $180 for a ticket purchased at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Delta said Friday that it had not planned to announce the flight expansion yet. 
However, its chief pilot, Harold Alger, "jumped the gun" in a tape-recorded 
telephone message to pilots. As a result, word got out to the public about the 
airline's plans. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was "a bit premature," Kolakowski said. "A number of 
operational considerations had not been finalized." 
</P>
<P>
Delta, according to its chief pilot's message, will operate four 107-seat 
Boeing 737 aircraft on the route. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Delta felt that there was a significant opportunity as a result 
of American Airlines' action in the last 18 months of pulling back about 40% in 
the California corridor. In addition, USAir, another major player in the 
corridor, is losing money in the market. Its Chairman Edwin I. Colodny had said 
in a recent interview that competition was so stiff on the corridor that no one 
could make money there. 
</P>
<P>
"Both United and Delta have watched American's presence decline and have seen 
USAir as a victim, so they are turning the heat up," said Daniel I. Hersh, 
airline analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los Angeles investment 
firm. "United and Delta are looking for a windfall." 
</P>
<P>
Hersh added that United and Delta are expanding their San Francisco-Los Angeles 
service because "each seeks to establish itself as the top carrier for . . . 
businessmen who want service and convenience and are willing to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Transportation Department, in the third quarter of 1989, the 
latest period for which figures are available, United had a 27% share of the 
market, USAir had 30.9% and American had 18.8%. Southwest Airlines has about 3% 
of the market. During that three-month period, a total of 633,410 passengers 
traveled up and down the corridor. 
</P>
<P>
American's intentions concerning its future participation in the corridor 
market are not known. "The entire market is under evaluation," Alton Becker 
Jr., an American spokesman, said Friday. "American has not made a decision to 
further increase in that market. We already have 12 (daily) round-trips between 
Los Angeles and San Francisco, and we operate 13 daily flights between Los 
Angeles and San Jose." USAir and United had no comment on Delta's move. 
</P>
<P>
USAir said it was ending service at Long Beach because its flights have been 
going out carrying loads of only 25% to 35% of capacity. USAir operates five 
flights daily at Long Beach -- two to San Francisco, two to Las Vegas and one 
to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
A USAir spokesman said these routes could be adequately serviced with its 
flights in and out of Los Angeles International Airport and John Wayne Airport 
in Orange County.

STRUGGLING NATIONAL LUMBER TURNS TO INVESTMENT BANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., the struggling home improvement retailer, 
said Friday that it had retained Wedbush Morgan Securities of Los Angeles to 
help raise money for an ongoing restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber President Melvin C. Jaffee declined comment on whether a sale 
of all or part of the firm was contemplated, saying he was "waiting for advice" 
from the investment banker on how to raise "millions" in new funds. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe also said the company will close its Santa Ana warehouse next week and is 
entering the market for upscale kitchen, window and door products as part of a 
revamp aimed at bringing the company back to profitability by mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
A pioneer in do-it-yourself hardware stores, National Lumber has suffered 
declining fortunes since the mid-'80s and lost $4.4 million in the first three 
fiscal quarters ended Oct. 31. The company, which lost $4.6 million a year ago, 
has not yet reported year-end figures for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have attributed to the Fountain Valley-based company's 
problems to the failure to respond to the competitive challenge posed by the 
proliferation of hardware "super-stores," such as Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber has begun renovating its 21 stores to accommodate new displays 
for upscale kitchens, windows and doors, Jaffee said. The renovation is 
scheduled to be completed by the end of April.

NORDSTROM TO CHANGE ITS TIMEKEEPING PROCEDURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nordstrom department store chain, accused of pressuring employees to put in 
extra hours without pay, said Friday that it is refining its timekeeping 
procedures to do a better job of tracking how long its sales staff works. 
</P>
<P>
But a union official representing nearly 2,000 Nordstrom workers in the Seattle 
area, where the company is based, said the changes do not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom's record-keeping revisions were prompted by a finding by the 
Washington Department of Labor and Industries last week that the prestigious 
retailer has violated the state's minimum-wage act. The agency ordered the 
company to pay an unspecified amount of back pay. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities acted after investigating complaints by the United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union that the company pressures employees not to report the 
hours they put in writing thank-you notes, delivering merchandise to customers 
and attending staff meetings. Some Nordstrom employees have said the company's 
system of grading workers' performances on the basis of their sales per hour 
has encouraged workers to "punch out" before performing these duties. 
</P>
<P>
The changes disclosed Friday provide for Nordstrom stores to post sign-out 
sheets for salespeople who perform extra duties after normal work hours. 
Staffers leaving a store could punch out on the time clock but also indicate on 
the sign-out sheet that they are making a work-related stop on the way home. 
The next day, they would submit a time sheet showing how much extra time was 
put in. 
</P>
<P>
But Joe Peterson, president of Local 1001 of the commercial workers union, said 
the new setup "is trying to place the burden on employees to keep records, when 
it's their (Nordstrom's) responsibility to keep records." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson also took issue with a related policy memo Nordstrom sent out this 
week to its 30,000 employees across the country. The memo indicated, among 
other things, which tasks performed away from the sales floor would be 
considered sales or non-sales duties for judging employees' sales performances. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said the new policy, by classifying such work as writing thank-you 
notes as sales duties, would continue putting pressure on workers to avoid 
reporting the hours they work on these tasks.

PERSONAL FINANCE: HOME OFFICE WRITEOFF TRICKY BUT BENEFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Self-employed people, doctors, small-business owners and others seeking to take 
the elusive home office tax deduction may find the going a bit easier, thanks 
to a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
But the rules are still tough, and you'll have to be careful if you want to 
avoid triggering an audit. 
</P>
<P>
If you qualify, a home office deduction can be quite beneficial. Homeowners can 
write off a percentage of depreciation, utilities and other operating expenses. 
Also, once you qualify, you can deduct your costs of traveling from the office 
to other places of work as business-related travel expenses. And it's easier to 
take accelerated depreciation writeoffs on a computer or other office 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Qualifying is the hard part. You must use your home office exclusively -- and 
regularly -- for business. Also, authorities have generally maintained that you 
must generate income from activities in your home office -- in other words, it 
must be the "focal point" of your business activity. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Tax Court ruling last month has somewhat weakened that focal point 
requirement. The court ruled that an anesthesiologist who had no office in the 
hospitals where he worked could deduct home office expenses, despite the fact 
that his income was directly generated by seeing patients at the hospitals. 
That is because he phoned patients and hospitals, prepared for specific 
patients, kept records, read journals and performed other activities in the 
home office. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service had disallowed the deduction on grounds that the 
doctor did not generate income at his home office. But the Tax Court overturned 
that decision, saying he could deduct the costs of the home office because it 
was necessary for managing his business, he spent a lot of time there and no 
other space was available. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling mean in effect that you don't necessarily have to meet the focal 
point test to claim a home office deduction, says Sidney Kess, a New York CPA 
and tax attorney. Instead, like the anesthesiologist, you can meet an 
alternative "facts and circumstance" test that determines whether your home is 
a "principal place of business," Kess says. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, you must meet three criteria: Your home office must be used to 
carry out functions essential to your business activity; you must spend 
substantial time there, and you must have no other location available. 
</P>
<P>
Who can this ruling help? 
</P>
<P>
Kess cites an example of a full-time college professor who has no office at the 
college where he teaches and therefore must write papers and perform other work 
at home. The ruling might also help a professional musician who has no office 
at the concert hall or other locations where he performs and uses his home for 
practicing, writing songs or other work. An owner of a small business, such as 
a Laundromat, that contains no space for an office also could qualify, Kess 
says. 
</P>
<P>
However, you still must show that you use your home office exclusively -- and 
regularly -- for business, Kess says. 
</P>
<P>
And if you are not self-employed, you must meet yet another strict rule: You 
must show that you maintain a home office "at the convenience" of your 
employer. That means your employer fails to provide adequate office space for 
you to do your job at the workplace. A sales agent, for example, might claim 
the deduction if his employer provides no office space to keep logs of sales, 
make phone calls and the like. 
</P>
<P>
If you think that you can meet these criteria, by all means claim the home 
office deduction. But be careful. That deduction is subject to great abuse and 
thus warrants tough IRS scrutiny. Accordingly, it's one of the primary things 
that can trigger an audit.

SOUTHLAND READY TO LET MARDI GRAS ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Somehow, the motto of Mardi Gras seems to say it all: Laissez les bons temps 
rouler! (Let the good times roll!) And Southlanders will be able to do just 
that at festive celebrations today and Tuesday in Hermosa Beach, Santa Monica 
and San Luis Obispo and on Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In French, Mardi Gras means Fat Tuesday. The annual celebration falls on the 
Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent, a Christian period of 
penitence and fasting that concludes on Easter Sunday. The idea is to have a 
rip-roaring good time before Lent starts. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not just for Christians. The good-humored fun is there for anyone to 
enjoy. In fact, the origins of Mardi Gras are hazy, but it probably began in 
the Middle Ages and may have been a way of giving religious significance to 
ancient festivals celebrating the rites of spring. Today, it is celebrated in 
much of Europe and the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
The French brought the seeds of Mardi Gras with them when they colonized 
Louisiana in 1699, but it took a while for the idea to catch on. The traditions 
of Mardi Gras as it's now celebrated in New Orleans began in the 1880s and have 
come to encompass a month of parades and parties culminating on Fat Tuesday, 
which this year is Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, this celebration is known as Carnival, which is believed to 
come from the Latin phrase carne vale, "farewell to flesh." 
</P>
<P>
In some countries, Carnival is celebrated on the three days before Ash 
Wednesday, while other countries indulge in a monthlong revelry. The Rio de 
Janeiro Carnival is perhaps best known, but Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, 
Bolivia and Mexico also celebrate. In Mexico, part of the celebration includes 
bidding farewell to Senor del Mal Humor, an effigy symbolizing bad feelings and 
evil spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Mardi Gras celebrations this year include: 
</P>
<P>
* Hermosa Beach -- Queen Ida and the Bon Temps Zydeco Band bring their special 
brand of music -- a mix of Cajun, Creole, reggae, calypso, country and blue 
grass -- to the Hermosa Beach Civic Theatre, 710 Pier Ave., tonight at 8. Queen 
Ida won a Grammy in 1983 for her album "On Tour." 
</P>
<P>
Concert-goers are asked to come in costume to this Mardi Gras-themed event, 
sponsored by the Hermosa Beach Community Center Foundation. A post-concert 
reception featuring Cajun food from Jeanette's Classic American Cuisine is 
included in the price of the concert tickets, which are $40 each. Tickets are 
expected to be available at the door. For information, call (213) 318-3452. 
</P>
<P>
* San Luis Obispo -- "It's Magic" is the theme of the annual Mardi Gras 
celebration in San Luis Obispo today in the downtown area. Daytime events 
include a gumbo cook-off and other New Orleans-style food, when Garden Street 
becomes Bourbon Street West. A parade with bands, elaborate floats and costumed 
characters starts at 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a parade you've seen anywhere else," says Don Koberg, a 
professor of architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He launched Mardi Gras 
there about 12 years ago because he missed the celebrations of his native New 
Orleans. "It's like a neighborhood Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
Koberg suggests parade-goers plan to come early and stay late and enjoy the 
many parties being held in downtown eating establishments. 
</P>
<P>
For those truly into the spirit of the event, there's the Mardi Gras Ball, 
which will be held at San Luis Veterans Memorial, Monterey and Grand streets, 
after the parade. Tickets for the ball are $20. Some tickets will be available 
at the door, but only to those in appropriate costumes. The ball, Koberg says, 
helps pay for the parade each year. For information, call (805) 543-0223. 
</P>
<P>
* Olvera Street, Los Angeles -- The burning of Mal Humor is part of the 
festivities planned on Olvera Street Tuesday starting at 6 p.m. There will be 
dancing to the Latin rhythms of Los Marischal and a parade. Special 
performances are also scheduled by Embrasamba, a Brazilian band, at 7 p.m. and 
9 p.m. and Soul of Brazil, a dance company, at 7:30 p.m. Olvera Street shops 
and restaurants will be open until about 10 p.m. For information, call (213) 
687-4344. 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Monica -- Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica, is 
presenting a parade, carnival and dance on Tuesday starting at 5 p.m., when the 
members of the procession will gather on the grass meridian at Olympic 
Boulevard and 11th Street. The parade, which will proceed to Highways, will 
include performers from "Sex, God &amp; Politics," an intercultural festival 
that plays there through April 14; 85 children from Edison Elementary School 
for whom Hugo Sanchez, a Mexican artist in residence at Highways, helped create 
costumes and masks, and walking murals and large movable puppets, also created 
by Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Burnham, co-director of Highways, says the parade will be "small, but 
colorful and interesting." The carnival, which will be held in a warehouse next 
door to Highways, includes African food booths, mask-making booths, mural 
painting and a display of murals by Sanchez. There is no admission charge for 
the carnival. A dance at 8:30 p.m. is $5 per person and features the music of 
San Andreas Fault, a band from Tijuana. For information, call (213) 453-1755. 
</P>
<P>
You may well have also heard of the UCLA Mardi Gras, planned for May 18, 19 and 
20, or the premiere of the Long Beach Mardi Gras due Oct. 13 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the UCLA festival has little to do with Mardi Gras other than the 
name. The event, a fund-raiser for UniCamp, a UCLA charity for underprivileged 
children, is actually a carnival with rides, food booths, games and crafts, 
mimes, clowns and magicians. Admission is $5 for adults and $2 for children. 
</P>
<P>
Then how did it get the name Mardi Gras? Karla Johnson, public relations and 
promotion director for the event, says it began as a masquerade ball in 1941 
when a Mardi Gras theme was chosen. The event evolved into a carnival, but the 
name was maintained because of the recognition it had acquired. UCLA Mardi Gras 
is held at the UCLA athletic field at the corner of Sunset and Westwood 
boulevards. For information call (213) 825-8001. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach event will try to recreate the atmosphere of Mardi Gras, but it 
was scheduled in October for two reasons. First, holding it in late February 
would place it too close to the Long Beach Grand Prix, according to Linda S. 
Wall, president of Mardi Gras International, the firm presenting the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she says, it wasn't desirable to be in direct competition with the annual 
Mardi Gras in New Orleans, because her firm hopes to build the Long Beach event 
to one of national stature. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Mardi Gras will include a golf tournament, a cruise; Mardi Gras 
ShoreFest with entertainment, Cajun food and international music; the "Wanna-Be 
Parade" (participants are encouraged to be whoever or whatever they "wanna be") 
and the Mardi Gras U.S. Western Regional Kinetic Sculpture Race, where 
people-powered vehicles that are also works of art traverse terrain obstacles 
such as mud and sand. For information, call (213) 433-2400.

TOPIARY SHAPING UP IN CONTEMPORARY GARDENS; 
</P>
<P>
GARDENING: TRAINING AND TRIMMING SHRUBS INTO ORNAMENTAL SHAPES IS AN OLD ART 
THAT IS FINDING NEW POPULARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA TYSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say topiary and these images might pop into mind: lions, tigers, bears and 
perhaps bunnies lovingly shaped and snipped from the greenery of an English 
garden. But the world of topiary is much broader. 
</P>
<P>
Quite simply, topiary is the pruning and training of shrubs and trees into 
ornamental shapes, and those shapes may be as basic as geometric forms or as 
elaborate as a ship in full sail. 
</P>
<P>
Topiary encompasses small, portable plantings as well as the great, maze-like 
hedges of estate gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an old art that's become popular again," says Dorothy Bohannon, a topiary 
devotee and a 11-year volunteer at South Coast Botanic Garden. 
</P>
<P>
On March 4, Bohannon will give Southland gardeners an introduction to the 
"World of Topiary" through a 2 p.m. lecture and demonstration at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Bohannon's interest in topiary is an outgrowth of European trips with her 
husband. During their travels, she saw the topiary of many European gardens, 
especially the formal, elaborate gardens still tended along France's Loire 
River. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so prevalent there -- it's in almost all the countries -- that it was 
fascinating to me," she explains. "I tried a little on my own and got some 
books and read up on it." 
</P>
<P>
In England, she notes, many of the topiary gardens are less formal. 
</P>
<P>
"The English like it more whimsical," she says. "Very often you'll see animals, 
even a whole hunt scene as a hedge. There will be a man on a horse going over a 
fence with hounds and in front of them, the poor little fox, and it'll all be 
done in greenery." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the best, most elaborate examples of topiary can be found 
at the Ladew Topiary Gardens at Monkton, Md., and at Green Animals in 
Portsmouth, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home and more familiar to Southern Californians may be the romping 
topiary figures near Disneyland's "It's a Small World" ride. 
</P>
<P>
Bohannon notes that topiaries, in their portable form, are often seen at 
outdoor weddings and lawn parties. Small, movable shaped plants and trees often 
are placed around to add greenery.

About six years ago, Bohannon started clipping and shaping topiaries at the 
botanic garden. 
</P>
<P>
At South Coast, her handiwork is scattered around near the English Garden, 
about half a mile from the front entrance. There's no formal topiary area, 
although the garden's foundation hopes to establish one on the grounds and has 
included it in the garden's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
For Southern California gardeners, Bohannon recommends "generally, vines and 
small-leaf compact plants that you think of as close shrubbery -- that do not 
have large blooms. A camellia, for example, would not do well. You want the 
form; you're not looking for large flowers during the year." 
</P>
<P>
And that lack of blooms, Bohannon notes, is one of the advantages of topiary. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks good on a year-round basis," she says. "It's not something just to 
look forward to for three months a year." 
</P>
<P>
But blossoming vines like bougainvillea are also candidates and, Bohannon says, 
are quite beautiful in bloom. Herbs like rosemary and thyme also are 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a large round circle of rosemary," Bohannon says. "It's lovely to see. 
It's aromatic and you can snip a piece for culinary use." 
</P>
<P>
If you're worrying about the amount of time topiary will take, don't. 
</P>
<P>
"It really doesn't take a lot of clipping," she says of her home topiary 
efforts. "I clip about every three weeks and it takes only about a half-hour." 
</P>
<P>
And you need only a good pair of hand clippers for equipment, she says. 
</P>
<P>
For beginners, Bohannon recommends as a reference "The Complete Book of 
Topiary" by Barbara Gallup and Deborah Reich, which includes plenty of 
illustrations and explanations on how to make a form and train the greenery. 
</P>
<P>
An easy introduction to topiary that Bohannon recommends requires a pot, a 
frame (readily available at many Southland nurseries) and small-leaf ivy: 
</P>
<P>
"Start the ivy all around the pot and tie it to the frame. Within a year, it 
would virtually cover the frame," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And if you happen to use a cone shape, you might add lights and ornaments for 
an instant Christmas tree, come holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike some other forms of trained plants, such as bonsai, "there isn't a 
formula," Bohannon notes. "You can be quite creative and no one will criticize 
you."

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's 
spill response log for December.

QUICK HALT TO MALATHION SPRAYING UNLIKELY, LEGAL EXPERTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: CITIES WOULD HAVE TO PROVE THAT MALATHION IS DANGEROUS AND, EXPERTS SAY, 
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SWAY A JUDGE. 
</P>

<P>
Experts in environmental law say Los Angeles and other Southern California 
cities stand little chance of winning a quick halt in court to the state's 
aerial spraying of malathion, aimed at killing the Mediterranean fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
They say the cities would have to prove the spraying is dangerous. So far, they 
have been able to point only to studies that suggest it might be. 
</P>
<P>
This weaker position is probably not enough to persuade a judge to overrule 
Gov. George Deukmejian, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has declared, in effect, that minimal health risks are worth taking 
to combat the Medfly, whose presence, he contends, constitutes an emergency 
threat to the state's agriculture industry. 
</P>
<P>
When the governor declares an emergency, judges tend to scramble out of his 
way, much like motorists making room for an ambulance. Unless it can be shown 
that the governor turned on his "siren" irresponsibly, judges probably will not 
block him. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very much that a judge would intervene," said UCLA law professor Henry 
W. McGee Jr., unless there is "some very powerful proof" that spraying makes 
people sick. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state has repeatedly used helicopters to spray small sections of 
Los Angeles County, the only comparable large-scale spraying of an urban area 
occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1981 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Legal challenges to that spraying got nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the current fight, seven cities, including Los Angeles, have taken the state 
to court. It is unclear, however, how determined some of them are. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city councils of three Orange County cities -- Huntington 
Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster -- gave their lawyers 36 hours to prepare a 
lawsuit asking judges to immediately stop the spraying. One Medfly expert said 
the Orange County lawyers were in such a hurry that they turned down his offer 
of information, saying they had no time to absorb it. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the word at 10 p.m. on Monday (Jan. 22), and we were in court in 
Sacramento on the morning of the 25th," said Huntington Beach City Atty. Gail 
Hutton. "I wished we had more time. We worked really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Robert Sangster said city officials believed they had 
"favorable factual circumstances," but they were aware that they faced 
tremendous odds in their bid to halt the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that a mated Medfly has not been found within five miles of the 
city," Sangster said. "But I think that the judge, as probably most judges are, 
was very reluctant to overrule a declaration of emergency by the governor. If 
there is a conflict, the court is going to resolve the conflict in favor of the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, a Superior Court judge in Sacramento rejected these cities' bids 
out of hand. The councils have not authorized further legal actions, one of the 
lawyers said. A similar effort by the city of Pomona in Superior Court also was 
dismissed, although officials there say they anticipate the council will 
authorize additional attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than ask for immediate intervention, the cities of Los Angeles, Glendale 
and Burbank decided to bide their time when they filed suit this week. 
</P>
<P>
Keith W. Pritsker, a Los Angeles deputy city attorney who played a key role in 
drafting these cities' suits, said he recognized there was almost no chance 
that a Superior Court judge would intervene at the drop of a hat. Therefore, 
Pritsker said, the cities did not ask him to. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they said in a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court, they would ask 
for an injunction later -- presumably in several weeks -- after they had built 
a better case. 
</P>
<P>
City lawyers said they would use the additional time and court procedures to 
compel the state to turn over the entire documentary record of why officials 
decided to spray malathion and why they believe the spraying is safe. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the cities hope to show that the governor's emergency declaration 
was a sham concocted to keep agricultural interests happy and avoid the 
requirements of state environmental laws. The laws require a fair-minded impact 
study, with public participation, whenever an action such as spraying may 
significantly affect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
They also hope the documents will show that the governor and state agricultural 
officials did not consider less-risky alternatives to aerial spraying such as 
stripping trees of fruit in affected areas and introducing a parasite known to 
feed on the fruit fly's larvae. 
</P>
<P>
The cities have a substantial ally in the Natural Resources Defense Council, a 
national, nonprofit environmental group that filed its own suit along with more 
than a dozen state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
While the cities' interest may be short-term -- stopping the spraying to 
protect the health of its residents -- the Natural Resources group is seeking 
long-range reform of pest control practices statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The state says it was not required to do an environmental impact report on the 
aerial spraying because the California Environmental Quality Act specifically 
allows impact studies to be skipped in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
But the cities argue that state agricultural officials brought the disputed 
emergency on themselves by failing to plan alternative methods for combating 
the Medfly infestations that have been detected in California periodically 
since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
As Pritsker said: "Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency 
on our part." 
</P>
<P>
Both the cities and the Natural Resources Defense Council are demanding that an 
environmental impact assessment be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a back-and-forth argument that seems likely to intensify, Deputy Atty. 
Gen. Charles Getz said state agricultural officials have already completed the 
"functional equivalent" of an environmental impact report. The adequacy of this 
so-called "functional equivalent" is likely to be the key issue in court, 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
In the only suit that succeeded in stopping aerial spraying of a pesticide in 
California, Northern California environmentalists and organic farmers won an 
injunction in 1985 to stop the state from spraying the pesticide Imidan against 
an infestation of apple maggot fruit flies. The state had planned to spray 
Imidan statewide for up to seven years but did not carry out an environmental 
impact assessment or, the courts found, an equivalent study. 
</P>
<P>
After a court-ordered halt to that spraying, the Legislature enacted a statute 
to make it easier for state agricultural officials to claim they had done an 
equivalent study. 
</P>
<P>
The new law provided that any time the state approved a pesticide for regular 
agricultural use, it was the "functional equivalent" of an environmental impact 
report. The cities hope to show, with the state's own documents, that this 
registration procedure is inadequate to be considered the equivalent of an 
environmental impact report, regardless of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said they also hope to show that the state manipulated data 
for political reasons by overplaying the Medfly's potential economic cost to 
farmers and underplaying health risks to city dwellers.

FORMER DOCTOR GETS PRISON TERM FOR ATTEMPTING SEX CHANGE ON O.C. MAN

<TEXT>
<P>
A former doctor whose medical license was revoked because of gross negligence 
was sentenced Friday to three years in prison for attempting a sex change 
operation on a young man. 
</P>
<P>
John Ronald Brown, 67, of Chula Vista was found guilty in December of four 
counts of practicing medicine without a license. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez ordered Brown to pay $10,000 in 
restitution to the patient, a 30-year-old Orange County man. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's attorney, Jacqueline Crowle, said he had performed 500 "gender 
reassignment surgeries" in his 40 years of practice. She urged the judge to 
grant probation and allow him to return to Mexico. Crowle said Brown was 
willing to return the $9,300 the victim had paid him for the surgery, which was 
not completed. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Eichler said Brown was convicted in San Francisco in 
1985 of practicing medicine without a license, doing the same type of surgery, 
and was ordered not to continue. Brown's license was revoked in 1977, and he 
unsuccessfully attempted to have it reinstated in 1983, Eichler said.

MEDICAL CENTER 'SATURATED' SINCE TRAUMA UNIT CLOSED 
</P>

<P>
Nurses are threatening to quit, surgeons are "up in arms" and the emergency 
room at UCI Medical Center has been "saturated" day after day, in part because 
one of Orange County's four trauma centers closed last year, UCI Medical Center 
director Mary Piccione told a meeting of health care experts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Piccione warned that Orange County officials must quickly recruit another 
hospital to operate a fourth trauma center and share the burden of the county's 
critically injured patients because her hospital cannot operate under siege 
conditions indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue at the level we're working at," Piccione told two dozen 
health care experts who comprise the Orange County Coalition for Health Care 
Solutions, a task force organized by state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
Piccione's comments followed a report by county Emergency Medical Services 
officials that suggested there have been few problems in the trauma system 
since Dec. 27, when Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center closed 
its trauma center for good. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, many health care advocates said the closure sounded the death 
knell for Orange County's nationally known emergency care system. They 
predicted that the three remaining hospitals -- UCIMC in Orange, Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana and Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in 
Mission Viejo -- would not be able to care for all of the county's accident and 
gunshot victims. And, warned Dr. John West, the surgeon who helped found the 
trauma network in 1980, many more trauma patients would die because of longer 
ambulance or helicopter rides. 
</P>
<P>
County officials initially suggested that the system would survive fine without 
Fountain Valley, which had cited too many indigent patients and an inability to 
recruit neurosurgeons as the reasons it closed down its trauma center. But 
lately, officials have been negotiating with Los Alamitos Medical Center, 
trying to persuade it to join the trauma system and fill the gap left by 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to exert every effort we can to get a fourth trauma center," Ron 
DiLuigi, assistant director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county EMS manager Betty O'Rourke and EMS medical director Robert 
Bade released a report showing that longer paramedic runs -- lasting more than 
20 minutes -- were occurring no more frequently than last year before Fountain 
Valley closed its trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
The report did note that the UCIMC and Western Medical Center-Santa Ana have 
taken most of the patients that would have otherwise gone to Fountain Valley -- 
in all 95 patients were sent to UCI this January and 92 to West-Med. The report 
also said that those two hospitals were closed to trauma cases because they 
were full 41 times this January, compared to 23 times in January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In brief comments to Bergeson's task force, O'Rourke said many of the closures 
occurred because both hospitals' intensive care units were full, but she said 
this situation "has not had an adverse effect" on the hospital's trauma 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Piccione disagreed. The EMS figures "don't reflect the full picture" of a 
hospital, she argued. In January, for instance, UCI handled not 95 trauma cases 
but 123, she said. The additional cases involved neurological injuries, 
Piccione said, but "they're trauma cases and they have to be done." 
</P>
<P>
She added that UCI's operating rooms were so filled with trauma cases lately 
that many elective cardiac surgeries were canceled and "our surgeons are up in 
arms." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana did not attend Friday's meeting, 
but Dr. Rand Hardy, trauma center director there, said in a brief interview, 
"We're seeing some of the same problems" as UCI. "Our intensive care unit has 
been filled and we had to open up some additional ICU beds to handle the 
traumas coming in. It has placed some strain on the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said his statistics showed that trauma cases since Fountain Valley closed 
are running 30% above last year. "Our physicians are coping with the increase," 
although the nursing staff was a little "thin" and some surgeons were unhappy 
that their elective cases have been bumped, he said.

CREWS FOCUS ON OIL SETTLED IN JETTY ROCKS

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As cleanup costs for the Orange County oil spill topped $12 million, biologists 
warned Friday that Alaskan crude still buried on beaches and trapped in rock 
jetties may threaten a nearby wildlife marsh for weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists also reported that, for the first time since the Feb. 7 spill, a 
sheen of oil residue entered the Huntington Beach wetlands earlier this week. 
Although county officials have rebuilt a 15-foot-high earthen dike to block 
oil-fouled high tides from reaching the 25-acre marsh near the Santa Ana River 
mouth, about 100 feet of the 25-acre marsh may have already been damaged. 
</P>
<P>
State fish and game experts said oil that seeped into the wetlands came from 
nearby jetties, where thick pools of black crude have settled in rock crevasses 
that are nearly impossible to clean. 
</P>
<P>
The jetties mark the entrance to the river mouth and two adjacent channels, 
including the Talbert Channel that leads to the wetlands that environmentalists 
consider among the most significant on the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still a lot of oil in those jetties, and the incoming tides and waves 
keep leeching it out," said biologist Gordon Smith, chairman of the Huntington 
Beach Wetlands Conservancy. "It's going to be a problem for some time. . . . 
The cleanup is far from over." 
</P>
<P>
As concern focused Friday on the Santa Ana River jetties and the nearby 
wetlands, cleanup officials walked much of a 10-mile stretch of shore from 
Bolsa Chica State Beach near Warner Avenue to the Newport Pier, assessing 
damage and the cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, officials in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach prepared 
today for a possible onslaught of beach-goers and oil gawkers, drawn to the 
coast by warm, spring-like weather. 
</P>
<P>
Sightseers, however, will find beach parking lots closed and access to the sand 
sealed off by yellow police tape, as cleanup crews tackle the remnants of the 
394,000-gallon spill from the ruptured tanker American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-mile strip of beach is closed for health and safety reasons. Officials 
warned that the ban will be strictly enforced, with violators being ticketed by 
police and lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no exceptions," Newport Beach marine safety officer Dave Wenger 
said. "We had a lot of disappointed people (Friday) who were turned away. I 
expect more of the same over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with British Petroleum, which owned the oil, announced Friday that 
the cleanup has so far cost the company $12 million, most of it for the 
1,400-worker force that was marshaled on the beach when the slick reached shore 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy announced that the 
three-member State Lands Commission will investigate the tanker accident during 
a hearing March 7 in Huntington Beach. The commission regulates offshore oil 
leases and related activities in state waters three miles out from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy also said the proposed Oil Spill Prevention and Response Act will be 
amended to double fines assessed to owners of single-hulled tankers involved in 
oil spills. If adopted, the fine for a vessel such as the American Trader would 
be $20 per gallon spilled, and $60 if the spill was caused through "gross 
negligence." 
</P>
<P>
An Assembly committee is reviewing the legislation, which would also create 
several new oil spill control programs and a $500-million response fund. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, cleanup officials met to establish guidelines for 
reopening beaches. Discovery of oil embedded up to 12 inches deep in sand above 
the high tide line has raised concerns about the cleanup's effectiveness and 
long-term safety to the public once the shoreline is reopened. 
</P>
<P>
Although no firm policy was adopted, Coast Guard Capt. James C. Card said after 
the meeting that the beaches will remain off limits until "all the oil that can 
be removed is removed." 
</P>
<P>
The general criteria officials will rely upon in deciding whether to reopen a 
beach will be "when you don't see, feel or smell any oil," he added. 
</P>
<P>
With most of the surface oil mopped up, cleanup workers Friday used varied 
techniques to scoop up the crude hidden below the surface. Along Bolsa Chica 
State Beach, so-called sanitizer machines separated sand from tar balls, while 
tractors plowed up sand on the north side of the Huntington Beach Pier to 
expose oil globs to sunlight and oxygen, in hope that the crude will eventually 
evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
"The beaches themselves -- from Warner Avenue to Beach Boulevard -- are in as 
good a shape as they've been" since the spill, Huntington Beach Fire Chief 
Raymond C. Picard said. 
</P>
<P>
Picard, however, said in some areas, particularly near the Santa Ana River 
mouth, "we're still tasting, feeling and seeing oil." 
</P>
<P>
Across the Talbert Channel, just east of the Santa Ana River, bulldozers on 
Friday rebuilt the sand dike washed out by last week's rain. Biologist Smith 
said the dike is needed because a thin layer of oil has reached the fringe of 
the Huntington Beach wetlands and threatened to contaminate the mud flats in 
the marsh, where shore birds feed. 
</P>
<P>
A culvert with a metal flap was installed at the base of the dike so rainwater 
from the river channel can push its way out but tainted seawater cannot flow 
back in. Officials hope that the culvert will be an effective alternative to 
the hole they had to punch in the berm to release runoff during last weekend's 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California Department of Fish and Game officials approved using a 
water solution heated to 190 degrees to clean the stubborn oil coating the 
jetties. A similar approach is being used on the rocks dotting the shoreline in 
Newport Beach, but that solution can be no hotter than 90 degrees -- a 
temperature considered safe for crabs, starfish and other marine life among the 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said the oil residue is so thick on jetties near the river mouth that 
any marine animals still in the breakwater are probably in "sad shape." Thus, 
using the hotter solution, sprayed from a pressurized hose, is a trade-off to 
save the wetlands, home to dozens of species of waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a choice between what life might be left in the rocks and a tidal marsh 
that has not been touched by oil," Smith said. "It's most important to save the 
marsh."

LAND TITLE DISPUTE IS HEADED FOR TRIAL

<P>
The controversy over plans for the Pierside Village development, which call for 
building more restaurants on the beach side of Pacific Coast Highway, is now 
headed for trial in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
A court commissioner Friday declined to hear the city's request to dismiss a 
suit in which the State Lands Commission argues against giving full title to 
the land involved to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. Robert G. Collins said the commissioner ruled there was 
not enough time before the trial date to schedule a hearing on the request for 
a summary judgment. The trial is scheduled to begin March 12. 
</P>
<P>
"The city had hoped to knock the state out of the lawsuit before the trial, but 
they weren't able to do that," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission, represented by the attorney general's office, is 
fighting the city's proposal to gain full legal title to about two acres 
immediately south of the Huntington Beach Pier now occupied by parking lots. 
The city wants to lease out the land between Main and 1st streets for a 
multimillion-dollar redevelopment project that would involve at least two new 
restaurants. Currently, Maxwell's is the only restaurant on the beach side of 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
The city does not own the land but has a right of way on it for public access, 
and the Lands Commission has argued that the city must guard that public access 
and not use it for commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
The city, in rebuttal, has argued that the public would be better served by 
building a restaurant area and plaza that people of all ages and the 
handicapped could visit. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups have led the opposition to Pierside Village, arguing that 
the development would be "visual pollution" to the public beach. Several 
business groups support the proposal, saying it would change "an ugly paved 
area" into an "accessible, landscaped" plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the Pierside Village project in concept on Tuesday 
night. Work on the project cannot begin until the city gains title to the land, 
however, and whether it will is to be decided at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Pierside Village project is a key element in the massive city redevelopment 
project now under way in the area around the intersection of Main Street and 
Pacific Coast Highway. BILL BILLITER

CLASSES MAY RETURN TO CLOSED SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fullerton School District is considering reopening Maple School for 
specialized programs while continuing to use it as a community services center. 
</P>
<P>
That recommendation for the closed elementary school was contained in a report 
to be considered during a public hearing at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the Maple 
Senior Multiservice Center, 701 S. Lemon St. 
</P>
<P>
The report was written by a task force of school and city officials, along with 
members of the public. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton School District leases space at the school to the city and other 
organizations providing community services. Services include day care, Head 
Start classes and the Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, which provides 
short-term housing for the homeless and emergency food supplies to low-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Duncan Johnson said he would like to see those services remain but add 
specialized school programs for some students. Maple School would not be 
reopened to provide regular classes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommends holding specialized classes at the school, such as 
advanced academic classes and specialized language classes for students 
learning English as a second language. The school should be open to 
preschoolers through sixth-graders from throughout the district, the task force 
said. TOM McQUEENEY

BUILDING STARTS ON UCI WOMEN'S CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 20 years of holding workshops in borrowed places, a women's center at UC 
Irvine is getting a permanent home on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Construction started last week for the Rachel Long Morgan Women's Opportunities 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The group has been renting offices in University Tower, across the street from 
the main campus, and offering seminars at local schools, libraries and vacant 
college classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"It means the culmination of a dream of a place of our own," said Elaine Hart, 
the center's director. "It means validation of the goals and the activities of 
the women's opportunity center by the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
For a $35 fee, the center offers classes on building self-esteem, dealing with 
divorce and grappling with career changes. Lawyers, corporate executives and UC 
Irvine professors offer advice about how to handle personal crises, legal 
issues and interviewing for jobs. For those who cannot afford the fee, a 
revolving scholarship fund has been established. 
</P>
<P>
"What we do is help people enrich their lives and open them up to opportunities 
that exist," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 people attend workshops and seminars regularly, not including members 
who may just stop to browse job listings. Although the programs are intended 
for women, men are permitted to belong to the center and attend workshops. 
</P>
<P>
The new center is to be built near UCI's Alumni House and is scheduled to be 
completed in summer, 1991. DANICA KIRKA

CLEAN-AIR RULES CALLED A ROADBLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials complained Friday that the three planned tollways, the Santa 
Ana Freeway widening project and other local transportation improvements could 
face lengthy delays due to "red tape" generated by proposed clean-air 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments, a regional planning agency, and 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District are adopting rules that would 
subject new transportation projects to additional public hearings and reviews 
to determine their conformance with regional clean air and traffic goals, said 
Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to reopen environmental impact reports or go through another 
layer of bureaucracy on projects that are almost ready to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed rules are a disaster," said Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley. "We're looking at delays possibly as long as six months to a year." 
</P>
<P>
SCAG and AQMD officials, however, said Friday that the situation is not as bad 
as it may first appear. 
</P>
<P>
SCAG spokeswoman Cindy Krebs said: "We have grandfathered in all transportation 
projects for which an environmental document has been circulated prior to March 
1. I think we have alleviated many of Orange County's concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County officials disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, they said that the three planned tollways in South Orange County 
could run into problems with the new regional air quality and mobility plan 
because the agency building them does not want to install car-pool lanes until 
the tollways have been open for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
While the new regulations do not require car-pool lanes, they give preference 
for projects that have them and require documentation explaining why they are 
not included. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie said he will ask the county Transportation Commission on Monday to 
approve a letter to SCAG outlining Orange County's objections. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new procedures contained in the regional Air Quality Management Plan, 
transportation officials must document how their project fits into SCAG's 
so-called regional mobility plan and affects air quality, how other 
alternatives also would affect the air, and why car-pool lanes, mass transit or 
other transportation-demand management tools have not been included. 
</P>
<P>
The regional traffic mobility plan includes four strategies for attaining 
federal clean-air standards. They include improving the balance of housing and 
jobs, travel demand management, better transportation systems management, and 
capital improvements such as new roads and rail lines. JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, A JACKPOT; 
</P>
<P>
LOTTERY: A FAMILY THAT MOVED TO ORANGE COUNTY FROM NEW JERSEY WILL SPLIT A 
$17-MILLION SHARE OF THE LARGEST-EVER LOTTO PAYOFF. HOW MUCH WAS SPENT? $30.

<P>
Joan Young had only bought her usual few dollars worth of lottery tickets. But 
the $30 gamble paid off big. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who recently moved to Laguna Niguel from New Jersey with her husband, 
split the largest-ever Lotto jackpot with three other Californians. Her share: 
$17.14 million. 
</P>
<P>
"To adopt a California phrase: It's wow, awesome!" Young said Saturday at a 
press conference at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Young beamed excitedly as she sat under glaring TV lights. Seated to her right 
was another winner, Lydia Neufeld of Simi Valley. And standing behind was her 
daughter, Donna Picciano, who gripped the back of her mother's chair and 
smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Young said she will use her new-found wealth to travel and help keep her 
father, Charles Stahl, healthy. Stahl, 78, who has a consumptive heart 
disorder, was at the press conference, peeking between TV cameras at his 
daughter and granddaughter from his wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
The windfall will be paid in segments of $685,600 each year for the next 20 
years. Young said she will divide the annual money evenly with her husband, 
Charles; her daughter and her daughter's husband, Frederick Picciano. 
</P>
<P>
The four chipped in $1.25 apiece Tuesday after a turkey dinner to buy five 
entries. Before buying the winning ticket, the family had already bought $25 in 
Lotto tickets. Young bought the winning ticket at a nearly empty Circle K store 
at 30009 Crown Valley Parkway, near her home. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the lines were going to be bad on Wednesday, so I went on Tuesday," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Her suspicions were right, said John Garner, South Coast regional manager for 
the California Lottery. Lotto machines throughout California sold 100,000 
tickets per minute as the deadline approached for the jackpot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After the six balls fell into their slots, revealing that the Youngs had the 
randomly selected six numbers, they were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
"We checked the numbers over and over," Charles Young said. "We didn't believe 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Young, 55, had worked as legal secretary in Hackensack, N.J. Her 
60-year-old husband retired after working 38 years for Public Service Electric 
&amp; Gas Co. in Newark, N.J. The couple celebrated their 37th anniversary on 
Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more than what we've made all our lives," said Joan Young of their 
winnings. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Picciano, 35, left her hometown of Teaneck, N.J., three years ago when 
her husband, who is 38, landed a job with Tarbell Realtors in San Juan 
Capistrano. Her parents joined them in Orange County in October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
California schools will receive $65 million from ticket purchases for 
Wednesday's game, the lottery's Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps the schools, and that's the best part," said Picciano, who plans to 
vacation soon in Hawaii. She has not yet decided whether she should quit her 
job as a legal secretary in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Young confessed that she is not a big gambler. She usually wagers $5 when there 
are big jackpots. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming a millionaire this week, she had won $5 a couple of times and 
$70 once, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really a wild player," she said. "I wouldn't play $100." 
</P>
<P>
Circle K Corp. will receive a $85,700 jackpot bonus commission for selling a 
winning ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The two other winners, not present at the press conference, were Michael Yang 
of Valencia and George E. Carpenter of Long Beach. The winning numbers were 12, 
21, 27, 34, 41, 44. The bonus number was 6.

DISABLED DENIED PROPER STATE FUNDING, ADVOCATES SAY

<P>
Orange County advocates for the handicapped on Friday painted a bleak picture 
of the quality of services provided to mentally disabled residents and 
predicted a "crisis" in care if state spending is not increased. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the (current levels of spending) is to direct problems back into 
the community," said Richard B. Farmer, a representative of the Assn. of 
Retarded Citizens. "People without adequate programs will roam the streets and 
create havoc that will be reflected in increased police services and other 
areas of the community." 
</P>
<P>
The comments came at a state legislative hearing at Tustin City Hall that 
attracted nearly 100 residents and officials from throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Three legislative subcommittees are looking into allegations that the state has 
neglected services to the developmentally disabled and were seeking comment 
from parents, service providers, consumers and local agencies on how the system 
can be changed. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's hearing was the last of 16 such community-based gatherings in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who testified charged that the state is providing inadequate 
staffing at regional developmental centers and paying severely inadequate wages 
for employees at state hospitals and community-care homes. 
</P>
<P>
"At some of our community-care facilities, the clients are making more than the 
staff who serve them," said Debra Marsteller, a representative of Orange County 
service providers. Some of those who testified also denounced a proposal by the 
state Department of Developmental Services to have parents with incomes of 
$50,000 or more pay fees for some services. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Macomber, director of the Department of Developmental Services, denied 
that there has been inadequate funding for the handicapped. In testimony at 
Friday's hearing, he called the proposed state budget increase of $59 million 
next year for community services a "step forward" in addressing the needs of 
the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
According to state figures, more than 95,000 people in Orange County are 
developmentally disabled, including people with brain disorders, those who are 
unable to walk, are blind or are deaf. About 25% reside in community-care 
facilities while the balance live at home with their families. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates for the handicapped say that many more patients could be housed in 
community-care homes if more money was provided by the state. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is especially acute in Orange County where the high cost of housing 
has forced the closure of an estimated 300 community-care homes, said Rhys 
Burchell, executive director of a Tustin-based social watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, the Area XI Developmental Disabilities Board, has charged that the 
state Department of Developmental Services is "out of compliance" with state 
laws protecting handicapped people for not providing proper housing. 
</P>
<P>
The group has threatened to sue the state and will hold a public hearing April 
4 at Tustin City Council chambers.

DEFICIT FORCED DENNARD OUT AT FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Preston Dennard, who last week said he resigned his position as a Cal State 
Fullerton assistant football coach, now says he did not resign but was 
dismissed because of a staff cut caused by concerns over an athletic department 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Dennard, a former Ram receiver, coached at Fullerton for one season. He lost 
his job when Coach Gene Murphy was told to reduce his staff to eight 
assistants, one below the NCAA standard for Division I programs, Dennard and 
other department sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennard had the least seniority on Murphy's staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I very much wanted to be there," said Dennard, who had said he resigned to 
pursue other opportunities. "Technically, what happened was I was informed that 
it was brought upon (Murphy's) shoulders to make a decision to remove one or 
more persons from his staff to add to cutting the budget. . . . I love Murphy 
dearly. It came down to business. I happened to be the last guy hired." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Athletic Director Ed Carroll declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic department is operating with a deficit of $236,000, an athletic 
department source said. 
</P>
<P>
More cuts are likely in what Carroll said in a department memo will be "a 
difficult spring" for the department, which operates 17 sports on a budget of 
$4.37 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the current deficit, Fullerton must deal with the budgetary 
implications of a recent study that showed that the university must allocate an 
additional $145,000 to women's programs to come into compliance with Title IX, 
the federal law that requires women's sports to be funded proportionally to 
men's. 
</P>
<P>
Dennard, 34, said he is pursuing work in the broadcasting field and possibly in 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely enjoying coaching," he said. "I did not resign." 
</P>
<P>
With Dennard's departure and the resignation of Ed Donatell, who is leaving to 
become an assistant coach with the New York Jets, Murphy has seven assistants 
on his staff.

FULLERTON FACULTY QUESTIONS STATUS OF FOOTBALL PROGRAM

<P>
A Cal State Fullerton faculty group has sent a set of questions to university 
President Jewel Plummer Cobb about whether the school should continue its 
Division I football program, according to a source at the university. 
</P>
<P>
The Academic Senate, an advisory group, has asked Cobb to respond within two 
weeks to 19 questions, ranging from the program's financial feasibility to the 
possibility of moving it to Division II or III to the impact of not having a 
football team to play in the planned $10.2-million stadium and sports complex 
scheduled to open in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb in November pledged an additional 20 scholarships to the program in a plea 
for Coach Gene Murphy to turn down offers from other schools, saying then that 
Division I football was an important part of the athletic program's future. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Ed Carroll responded to the faculty group's move, saying 
Division I football is central to the athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that the Cal State Fullerton football program has finished 
first or second in the Big West (Conference) for six of the past seven years. 
We have a stadium coming on board. We have a financial plan that has funded the 
program in the past. It is certainly in the best interests of the entire 
athletic program and institution to maintain the commitment that we have shown. 
That is certainly what we are going to do." 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Murphy, who has been the Fullerton coach for the past 10 
seasons, were unsuccessful, as were attempts to reach Cobb and members of the 
faculty group. ROBYN NORWOOD

STOP-SMOKING FIRM READY TO CASH IN ON BAN;

<P>
The skies will become anything but friendly to smokers Sunday, and Charles 
Sleichter couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
Like an air-conditioning salesman sensing a summer heat wave, Sleichter 
predicts that sales of his company's "smoking alternative" chewing gum will 
take off when a smoking ban on almost all U.S. airline flights takes effect 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The potential is "phenomenal," said Sleichter, president of Advantage Life 
Products Inc. in Laguna Hills. "If you look at all the smoking bans, this one 
gives (smokers) no way out." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Advantage is moving to capitalize on the ban. It has wooed a chain of 
airport gift shops to stock its CigArrest chewing gum and has plans for a 
$4-million advertising campaign later this year. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Hills firm has set up displays in department stores, pharmacies and 
airport gift shops featuring a new slogan: "Help Me Make It Through the 
Flight." 
</P>
<P>
The business prospects brought about by the ban have not been lost on 
Advantage's competitors in the growing $285-million stop-smoking industry, a 
market expected to grow by 17% annually through 1995, according to a study by 
MarketData Enterprises, a Lynwood, N.Y., market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
Dep Corp., the Rancho Dominguez distributor of Ban-Tron stop-smoking pills, 
says it is trying to negotiate a deal with some airlines in which its gum would 
be offered to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Schick Laboratories, one of the largest stop-smoking clinic chains in the 
nation, is braced for a new onslaught of customers in the wake of the ban. The 
company is cutting its fees and sponsoring a television special that will 
highlight the need to stop smoking in light of the airline ban, said Schick 
spokesman Ed Butler. 
</P>
<P>
The new law bans smoking on all flights within the United States except for a 
few that last six hours or longer to or from Hawaii or Alaska. Congress passed 
the law last year to replace a 1988 smoking ban on domestic fights of two hours 
or less. 
</P>
<P>
But since the ban has received relatively little press attention since it was 
passed, the president of an anti-smoking lobbying group believes that firms 
have been slow on the uptake. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there has been very little publicity and very little public 
controversy (now that) the ban is going into effect," said John F. Banzhaf III, 
executive director of Action on Smoking and Health in Washington. "I think the 
reality of it is that it has yet to hit the smokers. But once it does, I would 
expect that companies would capitalize on it." 
</P>
<P>
But not every company in the stop-smoking industry views the ban as a major 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Merrell Dow Inc., the Kansas City-based maker of the Nicorette chewing gum, is 
not planning any special promotions. Product Manager Jim Dawson said the 
nicotine-laced Nicorette is sold only by prescription as part of a medically 
supervised program to stop smoking. He said a promotional campaign to call 
attention to the airline smoking ban would encourage use of the gum as a 
temporary aid, rather than part of a permanent solution to a smoker's habit. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike CigArrest or Ban-Tron, Nicorette is recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration as a proven aid to alleviate the smoking urge. By contrast, the 
key ingredient in CigArrest and Ban-Tron -- lobeline sulfate, a non-addictive 
derivative of Indian tobacco -- is considered "unproven" though "possibly 
helpful" to smokers trying to kick their habit, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson would not comment on the success of Nicorette, but one private marketing 
study found that sales have more doubled since the product hit the 
pharmaceutical shelves in 1984. It ranked 89th on a list of the 200 most 
frequently prescribed drugs in the nation last year. 
</P>
<P>
Advantage's CigArrest does not contain nicotine and can be bought without a 
prescription, making it easier to market to air travelers trying to survive a 
flight without lighting up, Sleichter said. 
</P>
<P>
Sleichter has had his share of ups and downs so far in his effort to win the 
hearts of smoking air travelers. CigArrest is now stocked in gift shops at 
about six major airports and the firm is talking with other major operators of 
airport gift shops as well, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But CigArrest has failed to ignite much interest from the airlines on its offer 
to let flight attendants hand out free samples of the product to frustrated 
smokers. To alleviate airline officials' concerns that passengers will stick 
wads of gum on airline seats, Sleichter has gone so far as to demonstrate how 
the gum can be tucked back into the packaging foil. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't work, Sleichter has another solution: a new version of 
CigArrest in throat lozenge form. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the airline-smoking ban will help sales, Sleichter predicts that 
his publicly traded company's sales will increase to $12 million when its 
current fiscal year ends in April, up from $5.5 million in 1989 and $1 million 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1986 as Advantage Entertainment -- a distributor of exercise 
cassette tapes -- the company changed its name to Advantage Life Products to 
reflect its move into stop-smoking products. Advantage claims to have 10,000 
letters of endorsement from customers. And Sleichter proudly notes that there 
is only a 2% return rate on the product's money-back guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was totally worthless, you would have a higher return," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The average smoker doesn't kick the habit on the first or even second try, 
Sleichter said, which means that a single customer may try CigArrest several 
times. The product is also pitched to ex-smokers to "curb the urge to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
He said the company is careful in its claims about CigArrest. "We're not saying 
it's going to help you stop smoking, just help with the withdrawal."

NATIONAL LUMBER RETAINS BANKER TO HELP RAISE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
National Lumber &amp; Supply Inc., the struggling home-improvement retailer, 
said Friday that it has retained Wedbush Morgan Securities of Los Angeles to 
help raise money for a continuing restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber President Melvin C. Jaffee declined comment on whether a sale 
of all or part of the Fountain Valley-based firm was being contemplated, saying 
he was "waiting for advice" from the investment banker on how to raise 
"millions" in new funds. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe also said the company will close its Santa Ana warehouse next week and 
that it is entering the market for upscale kitchen, window and door products as 
part of a revamping aimed at bringing the company back to profitability by the 
middle of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a pioneer of the do-it-yourself hardware store, has suffered 
declining fortunes since the mid-'80s. For the three quarters ended Oct. 31, it 
reported a loss of $4.4 million. The company lost $4.6 million a year ago. It 
has not yet reported year-end figures for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts have attributed National Lumber's problems to a failure to 
respond to the competitive challenge posed by the proliferation of hardware 
"superstores" such as Home Depot. Jaffee personally has been criticized for not 
delegating more authority and not adapting to changing market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said the 112,000-square-foot Santa Ana warehouse could be closed because 
the company has a new inventory system that will allow it to reduce the amount 
of merchandise in stock while allowing quicker delivery of products. 
Inventories will now be managed within the 21 individual stores, which have 
been grouped into four districts. 
</P>
<P>
Closing the warehouse will save the company $250,000 per month, Jaffee said, 
and more efficient inventory management will result in further savings. The 56 
warehouse employees have been placed in other jobs with the company. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber has begun renovating its stores to accommodate the new displays 
for the upscale kitchens, windows and doors, Jaffee said. In addition, the 
company will for the first time be offering in-home sales and installation of 
those products and also of complete custom kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe said kitchens, windows and doors now account for just 2% of sales but 
that the new upscale-product strategy could raise that to 10% or 15%. 
Renovation for all stores is scheduled to be completed by the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
There are no plans for other major changes in National Lumber's product mix or 
pricing strategy, Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
The company has, however, implemented other cost-cutting measures, including a 
$1-million reduction in advertising expenditures and a $1.2-million cut in 
payroll costs resulting from a new "flex-plan" staffing system. Jaffee said 
there have been no layoffs among the company's 1,300-member staff and that none 
are contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the company appointed Frank Stephen as the company's chief financial 
officer, succeeding Jim Carnavale, who will remain as a consultant to the firm. 
Bill Takacs has been named vice president and chief of operations. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also increasing the amount of training given store managers and 
assistant managers. In addition, to enhance supervision and customer contact, 
it is establishing separate areas, each with its own assistant manager, in the 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said he expects the company to be profitable again, after six 
consecutive quarters of losses, by the fiscal 1991 second quarter ended July 
31. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed at $1.25 Friday, up 25 cents in trading on the 
over-the-counter national market system. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber was founded by Sol Jaffee in 1942. Melvin Jaffee, who now owns 
50% of the stock, was credited with spearheading a successful expansion 
beginning in the 1960s.

VAN DOREN TAKE GIANT LEAP WITH VANS SHOES LINE

If the Van Doren Rubber Co. has its way, Vans Shoes will be stepping out -- and 
making tracks all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange-based maker of the canvas sneakers made popular in the movie "Fast 
Times at Ridgemont High," has big plans to double its current annual sales of 
$60 million by May, 1992, said Jerry Gross, executive vice president at Van 
Doren. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Van Doren is gearing up for a national expansion of Vans Shoes, its 
line of classic and custom tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, about 35% to 40% of sales are through 57 Vans stores in Southern 
California, with a small amount of shoes sold through independent retailers, 
Gross said. A third of total sales are in Mexico, with the rest sold through 
7,000 store locations -- ranging from Nordstrom to mom-and-pop retailers -- 
across the United States and in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The real opportunity for growth is to develop markets outside Southern 
California," said Gross, who added that Van Doren hopes that the expansion will 
shift sales so that at least 50% are outside California. 
</P>
<P>
To aid the national expansion, Van Doren recently told Ripley-Woodbury of 
Cerritos to take a hike and handed its $3-million advertising account over to 
Eisaman, Johns &amp; Laws/L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt a larger agency with more national presence could help us get to the 
$100-million level more effectively than Ripley could have," Gross said.

S&amp;L BAILOUT LAWS SADDLE DOWNEY WITH $9.4-MILLION LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE SECOND STRAIGHT RED-INK QUARTER IS A DIRECT RESULT OF CAPITAL 
RESERVE REGULATIONS, WHICH FORCED THE STILL-SOUND S&amp;L TO SET ASIDE $20.7 
MILLION. IT POSTED A $13.6-MILLION PROFIT FOR THE YEAR.

<P>
Downey Savings &amp; Loan Assn., scrambling to comply with the tough strictures 
of the new thrift industry bailout law, on Friday reported a $9.4-million 
fourth-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts and Downey officials, however, said that the loss should be a 
one-time thing, forced on Downey by new accounting rules and capital 
requirements. The 33-year-old thrift continues to be financially sound, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Downey in fact posted a full-year profit of $13.6 million despite the sizeable 
fourth-quarter loss and a $3.7-million loss in the third quarter. The thrift, 
which has 49 offices in the state, ended the year with $41 billion in assets 
and a capital base of $219.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
That makes it one of only a few hundred thrifts nationwide that meets or 
exceeds the three tough new capital reserve requirements established by 
Congress, industry officials said. In all, there are about 2,800 thrifts in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Downey's third- and fourth-quarter losses were direct results of new federal 
regulations requiring S&amp;Ls to carry investment properties and securities on 
their books at or below initial purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rules, a thrift cannot show an increase in the market value of an 
investment property but must lower the value or set aside a reserve equal to 
the drop in value if the market value falls below the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
The rules also require S&amp;Ls to set aside reserves to cover a joint venture 
partner's potential losses as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Downey's case, a $20.7-million reserve was established for the fourth 
quarter to comply with the new rules. That reserve ate up what otherwise would 
have been an $11-million operating profit for the three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
But the thrift, which has announced plans to divest itself of its $590-million 
portfolio of shopping centers and other real estate holdings to meet the 
capital requirements in the next five years, is likely to make up for the 
losses with profits from the sale of properties, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
And Downey's fourth-quarter loss was in keeping with what analysts had 
predicted, so the thrifts's stock -- which is traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange -- did not lose much value after Friday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Downey common stock closed at $16.88 Friday, down 12 1/2 cents a share in 
moderately heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss for the quarter was less than I thought it would be," said Michael 
Abrahams, a thrift industry analyst with the regional brokerage firm of Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The regulators are being pretty rough these days, with the seizure of 11 
thrifts" Friday, including Mercury S&amp;L in Huntington Beach and Imperial 
Savings in San Diego, Abrahams said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw with Downey was similar to what happened to some of those others, 
with the regulators forcing Downey to set up perhaps unnecessarily large 
reserves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The regulators are trying to show how tough they are," said Abrahams, "but 
Downey is one of the best capitalized thrifts around and is well known as one 
of the classiest acts in the business." 
</P>
<P>
He said there is no sign that Downey is in trouble or will have to take another 
significant write-down of the value of its investments. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell Chaney, an analyst with Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, said Downey 
should do well this year because it won't have to pay federal income taxes on 
the first $95 million it earns. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the thrift has $95 million in operating losses from failed 
Butterfield Savings in Santa Ana, which it recently acquired, that Downey can 
use to offset an equal amount of profit. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald H. McQuarrie, Downey's chief executive and co-founder, said Friday that 
the thrift must use up the entire $95 million this year or lose it and plans to 
accelerate the sale of its shopping centers and other investment properties to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
"We have five years to sell all of our real estate," he said, "but we will sell 
the biggest part of it this year."

EX-PUPPETEER OF SEX PISTOLS ABANDONS SPOOFS FOR POLITENESS ON LECTURE CIRCUIT

<P>
Malcolm McLaren, the art-school expellee who exacted revenge on the world by 
unleashing the Sex Pistols, came to Cal State Fullerton Thursday to warn of the 
newest youth craze threatening suburbia: "The return of etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, I might've been somewhat against it," reflected McLaren, whose 
London leather goods boutique -- Sex, it was called -- was a spawning ground 
for the Buzzcocks and Boy George as well as the Pistols in the 1970s. "But 
nowadays, I rather like the reservation of it. Etiquette is so romantic," he 
mused. 
</P>
<P>
Now 44, the one-time puppeteer of spoof-musicians Adam Ant and Bow Wow Wow 
sounded more like Prof. Henry Higgins than Svengali. Fortunes were made, sure, 
but McLaren, an intellectual as well as a fop, saw his orchestration of 
no-talent vulgarians into rock stardom as an amusing social experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept was to be good by claiming to be bad," he said of the Sex Pistols. 
"By not playing, by not turning up at gigs, we made a movement out of it. It 
was mind-blowing." 
</P>
<P>
Propelled by driving, barely intelligible anthems like "Anarchy in the U.K.," 
the Pistols released a platinum record before disintegrating with the 
heroin-overdose death of the group's bassist, alleged murderer Sid Vicious. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful to see the aristocrats of the rock industry terrified at this 
audacious and ridiculous concept," McLaren said, recalling the self-mutilating 
band's onstage razor-blade antics. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other celebrated poseur of his era, Ronald Reagan, the McLaren who 
once shaped a generation through style now finds a receptive audience on the 
lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Taking the university lectern in his striped Oxford shirt and V-neck sweater, 
McLaren told the assembled students that when he was their age, "the thought of 
a career seemed absolutely vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
Possessing no talent as a writer, musician or visual artist, however, McLaren 
realized that only one profession seemed open to him: "Plunder. I asked myself, 
could I enter the world of plunder like the great masters?" 
</P>
<P>
He found inspiration in the world of English literature. "Like Fagan, I decided 
to get a lot of little boys to do my stealing for me." 
</P>
<P>
With the demise of the Pistols -- and the fading popularity of their look -- 
McLaren turned in the early 1980s to the next fad in fashion/music: New Wave. 
</P>
<P>
Viewing New Wave more as "a new hair style" than a musical trend, McLaren 
repackaged punker Adam Ant as an 18th-Century pirate, and assembled Bow Wow 
Wow, a synthesizer dance band distinguished by its singer, a bald, half-Burmese 
13-year-old girl named Anabella. 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, the admitedly non-musical McLaren was releasing records under his own 
name, and scored a hit of sorts with the square-dance novelty tune "Buffalo 
Gals," from his "Duck Rock" album. Not a composer or a lyricist, McLaren calls 
himself a "director" of music. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled his early creations somewhat uncharitably, describing John Lydon, 
nee Johnny Rotten, as "a New Wave Neil Diamond," and the ex-dandy Adam Ant as a 
pathetic failure "who should've stuck with being a pirate." 
</P>
<P>
At the Fullerton lecture, however, students seemed more interested in McLaren's 
philosophy than his colorful past. 
</P>
<P>
In seemingly random answers to the students' serious questions about the state 
of Western culture, McLaren gave cryptic clues to a Weltanschauung that 
embraces everything from rubber marital aids to Puccini operas. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to assess the lessons of the 1980s, he announced, "Girls are more 
interesting than boys. 
</P>
<P>
"They understand the word nuance. They aren't afraid to use the word pretty. I 
mean, girls aren't afraid to go into a room and say, 'Isn't this a pretty 
room,' " he stressed. 
</P>
<P>
McLaren praised the invention of the fax machine, asserting that it will lead 
to a triumph of the written word over its old enemy, the telephone 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
He offered reassuring words to Americans fearful that the United States has 
lost its place in the world economy: "All those Orientals on the other side of 
the Pacific are desperate consumers of Marilyn Monroe, rock 'n' roll and 
Coca-Cola," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But mainly, he professed the virtues, nay the ubiquity, of posing as a 
principle of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"From the girl back in the '50s who stuffs tissues in her bra to show that she 
has a bigger bust than other girls at the prom, to the lad with electric-shock 
hair in black leather who whips himself with chains to show he's not part of 
the money pit called London -- they're all brilliant poseurs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Posing is the repackaging of the form, whether you use it for a lofty 
intellectual pursuit or you use it just to get down and boogie," he said, 
adding disconnectedly, "and the form is that basic instinct of the beat." 
</P>
<P>
McLaren, who now lives in Hollywood, told The Times he is hard at work trying 
to repackage his own form. 
</P>
<P>
He has a film project, called "Waltz Darling," which depicts his hero, Oscar 
Wilde, discovering rap music on a trip to Africa in 1880. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps inevitably, he revealed a budding alliance with the corporate 
incarnation of posing, the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
The wholesomeness-based entertainment conglomerate had invited the ex-Sex 
Pistols' manager to Orange County to discuss the reformation of "The Mickey 
Mouse Club" under his guidance, McLaren said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Hollywood," he said. "They desire to stay in touch with the taste of 
the people."

PBS WILL EXTEND U.S. AIRING OF SOVIET NEWSCAST; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ALTHOUGH PBS WILL SHOW "VREMYA" FOR TWO MORE WEEKS, ORANGE COUNTY'S 
KOCE MUST END THE SHOW THURSDAY DUE TO ITS PLEDGE DRIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Public Broadcasting Service's two-week trial showing of "Vremya," the 
Soviet Union's official, state-produced nightly television newscast which had 
been scheduled to conclude Friday, will be extended for two weeks. But KOCE 
Channel 50, Orange County's PBS station, announced Friday that because of 
special spring membership festival programming, it will carry "Vremya" only 
through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Foster, executive producer of the news department at WGBH, the Boston 
station coordinating the "Vremya" broadcasts, said reaction to them has been 
large and positive. Still, he added, "we felt four weeks (of testing) would be 
a better test than two weeks. We want to find out if it's not just a viewing 
novelty and will have sustained viewership." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Schaefer, KOCE's director of public information, said that if the 
station was not involved in its pledge drive, it would air "Vremya" throughout 
the two-week extension. But "because our pledge schedule was locked in previous 
to the 'Vremya' offer, and all our promotional efforts had already been made, 
we are unable to schedule 'Vremya' during the last week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster estimated that he has received 100 cards and letters a day regarding 
"Vremya" since its debut Feb. 12, and "the fascinating thing is that 99.9% have 
been positive. When you make television shows, you can always get people not to 
like something about it. But I can only remember one post card saying, 'It 
stinks.' No one has called it communist propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Clark of Dana Point is one Orange County resident who has written in 
praise of "Vremya": "I believe 'Vremya' helps the American people to see that 
the Soviet people are human beings just like us," Clark wrote to KOCE. 
</P>
<P>
"They have families, trouble with their government, love their children and 
enjoy sports just like we do, and they are not a composite Evil Empire." 
</P>
<P>
"Vremya" is being made available to PBS stations free of charge by 
International Video Broadcasts Inc. in Fairfax, Va., which has an agreement 
with Gosteleradio, the Soviet state-controlled television network, for 
exclusive U.S. rights to its broadcasts. The program is translated into English 
by Soviet nationals working for IVB. 
</P>
<P>
KOCE is airing "Vremya" weeknights at 11:30. KCET in Los Angeles aired "Vremya" 
at midnight during the initial two-week run; a station spokeswoman said Friday 
the station had not yet decided whether it would carry the program for the 
additional two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Vremya" is airing on 88 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a lot in the Deep South and not much of the Southwest -- although 
Lubbock, Tex., and Las Cruces, N.M., are running it," Foster said. "But 
otherwise, the heartland of America has really taken to it, as has the big 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Continued presentations of "Vremya" will depend on finding corporate or 
foundation backing. Foster estimates it would cost $1 million annually to keep 
"Vremya" on the air in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The conviction is burning in my mind that there is appropriate corporate 
altruism or self-interest to keep it going," he said. "Given the attention the 
American people been giving it, it's a smart and cost effective underwriting 
venture for an American corporation or foundation."

THE GERMANS OF ORANGE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
EUPHORIA PREVAILS AT PHOENIX CLUB AFTER DRAMATIC EVENTS IN ANCESTRAL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERMAN WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the 400 German-Americans crowded into their own Phoenix Club in Anaheim 
last Nov. 10, the night was the most joyous celebration of their lives. They 
cheered, toasted and cried at every image that flashed across the television 
screens. To them, every scene of the thousands of Germans milling around the 
just-opened Berlin Wall was an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime sight. 
</P>
<P>
They cheered again when other Phoenix members unfurled a huge banner in German, 
reading "Finally, Freedom for East Germany," across one dance-floor wall. They 
shouted once more when Phoenix president Hans Klein announced club plans to 
sponsor the resettlement in America of five East German families. 
</P>
<P>
And the media, including Los Angeles television stations, were there in full 
force, making the celebration the most visible gathering in the history of 
Orange County's large German-American community. 
</P>
<P>
The euphoria of that night has yet to die down. 
</P>
<P>
"No one expected it (the opening of East German borders) to happen like this -- 
so suddenly, so completely. The wave of freedom has finally reached that part 
of Germany," said club member Erwin Simons. 
</P>
<P>
And Gunter Kunkel, a past Phoenix president, saw yet another impact from the 
Nov. 10 drama. "You're going to see more people (in America) showing their 
pride at being German-Americans," he said. "You're going to see them coming out 
of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
Such public displays of German-American pride are still rare in Orange County, 
even though the German-American population here is one of the largest in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The county has roughly 140,000 residents of direct German ancestry -- German 
immigrants or their immediate American-born descendants -- a total second only 
to Los Angeles County in California, according to Phoenix Club officials. 
Another 320,000 Orange County residents are believed to be of part-German 
ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
And German immigrants have played a pivotal role in Orange County history, 
dating back to 1857 when a band of German immigrants established the vineyard 
colony that was incorporated 21 years later as the town of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Yet established German-American organizations -- such as the 30-year-old 
Phoenix Club, the biggest social-cultural organization of its kind in Southern 
California -- have long kept a low, noncontroversial, rather innocuous profile. 
</P>
<P>
Before the monumental upheavals in East Germany and Eastern Europe, and the 
current high-diplomacy talks over reunifying West and East Germany, the 
German-American community in Orange County -- like those in many other American 
regions -- was usually ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Or taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"There has not been a clear-cut German ethnic identity or opinion bloc in 
America for generations -- not like there is, say, for the Italian or the 
Polish communities," said Robert Henry Billigmeier, a UC Santa Barbara 
sociologist and specialist on German-American history. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Phoenix Club, which has a membership of 3,500 families, most of 
whom are from Orange County, has for decades been the only German-American 
organization of any importance in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The already small number of private German-language schools has shrunk even 
further -- three schools in Orange County with overall enrollment of only 130 
children. The only Orange County church that still offers regular 
German-language services is the tiny Old World Community Church in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of all-out ethnic activism, social scientists have argued, is due in 
large part to an obvious phenomenon -- the swift and thorough assimilation of 
most German-Americans. In that sense, German immigrants -- whose overall 
numbers since colonial times have been surpassed only by English settlers -- 
are among the quintessential melting-pot success sagas. 
</P>
<P>
But the stigma of two world wars in which Germany was America's enemy is 
another crucial reason for the low profile of most German-American 
organizations. The fears of being thought of as foreign-culture militants or 
promoters of German nationalism are strong even today, social scientists and 
German-American organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about people denying or being ashamed of their German 
heritage. But we are talking about people who have found that for political or 
emotional reasons, you do not go around proclaiming it," explained historian 
Henry Cord Meyer of UC Irvine, himself the son of German immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Yet German-American organizers hope the events surrounding the opening of the 
Berlin Wall will bolster what amounts to an ethnic-roots movement for their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how assimilated we are, no matter how much we have been absorbed, we 
need to recognize our cultural past as much as any other group," said Elsbeth 
Seewald, president of the 30,000-member German-American National Congress, a 
Chicago-based cultural and civic affairs organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We need more than ever to reaffirm the great cultural, scientific and economic 
contributions of German-Americans in building America," Seewald added. "We must 
not be so reticent about such things." 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Club was founded on Aug. 4, 1960, by members of the last great wave 
of German immigration to America. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 local families, whose fathers were mostly craftsmen and businessmen, had 
left Germany during the 1950s, when their native country was still widely 
devastated from the war. 
</P>
<P>
However, this core group found that Orange County in the 1950s -- despite 
sizable German-American populations in Anaheim, Orange, Santa Ana, Huntington 
Beach, Garden Grove and Fullerton -- did not have a major gathering place for 
German immigrants and other German-speaking people. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving hundreds of replies to a classified ad about a German club, the 
core group in late 1960 held the first of its dances and other gatherings at 
local union and lodge halls. 
</P>
<P>
The name Phoenix Club "was very appropriate because we wanted to see our native 
culture reborn from the ashes of World War II," explained founding member Hans 
Klein, 68, a restaurant equipment consultant, who immigrated from the Hamburg 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But Phoenix was chosen only after more Germanic titles were dropped from 
consideration. "We also wanted a neutral name," Klein added. "We didn't want a 
name that suggested any of the old negative political or national images." 
</P>
<P>
The 19,000-square-foot clubhouse, built on a then 4 1/2-acre site near Anaheim 
Stadium and the Santa Ana River, was opened on April 21, 1965. "Except for the 
foundation and shell, we did it all with volunteers. That is why it's more than 
a clubhouse to us -- it's truly a home," said one of those club volunteers, 
Erwin Simons, 56, an interior architect who emigrated from Cologne. 
</P>
<P>
But the spacious club, with its dance floor, dining tables, huge bar, athletic 
facilities and outdoor kiddie rides, isn't all schnitzel, beer, polkas, sports 
and oompah-pah fellowship. The club also offers choir groups, ballet classes, 
German-language films and other such cultural pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
And the club not only provides its own German-language classes for adults, it 
also supports the German-American School Assn. of Southern California, which 
teaches 500 children in Saturday classes. The association's 15 schools are in 
Mission Viejo, Huntington Beach and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The club's current programs will remain intact even if it has to vacate its 
present site -- which is earmarked for the city of Anaheim's proposed sports 
arena complex -- and move to another location in the same area. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some club members believe that further erosion of the old German customs 
and the language is inevitable -- a situation, they said, that afflicts all 
ethnic groups. "We know that it becomes more and more a struggle to pass the 
heritage on to the younger generations. But it's our task to try and keep it 
alive as long as we can," said Hans Habereder, 74, originally from Munich and 
leader of Die Gemuetlichen Schuhplattler, the club's Bavarian-styled dance 
troupe. 
</P>
<P>
The club's own membership rolls are showing the slippage. Although 70% of the 
club's families are German-Americans, the number of member families has dropped 
from 5,500 in the 1970s to the current 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
One reason, club leaders said, is the familiar one of assimilation. Another is 
the sharp decline in new immigrant families, a key source of support for groups 
like the Phoenix Club. In 1951-1960, the number of Germans entering the United 
States was 345,000, the largest of any national group that decade. By 
1971-1980, the total had declined to 66,000. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp drop, said Seewald of the German-American National Congress, was due 
to a sweeping change in U.S. immigration laws and the vastly improved economic 
conditions in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
But one situation hasn't changed, some Phoenix Club members said, despite the 
passage of nearly 45 years since the end of World War II. They argued that the 
stigma of the war -- and the Hitler-era atrocities -- still lingers, especially 
for those who had lived in Germany during that era. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they said, it is an issue that shows little sign of truly fading. For 
example, they said, there has been a barrage in recent years of American 
television programs about or set in Nazi Germany. They argued that such 
programs have only perpetuated simplistic views of the Hitler era. 
</P>
<P>
"We were, as much as anyone, victims of (Hitler's) dictatorship," said the 
former Phoenix Club president, Kunkel, 55, a print-shop operator who was born 
in the Saar Basin. "But too often this issue of blame and guilt is greatly 
simplified when applied to the German people." 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing," Kunkel said, "critics have the habit of ignoring the crucial 
political and economic conditions throughout Europe that were just as much a 
part of that era." 
</P>
<P>
And some club members feel the magnitude of the Holocaust needs to be 
re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an issue that can be too easily exploited," said the Rev. Juergen Bless, 
48, a native of Hamburg and pastor of the Old World Community Church in 
Huntington Beach. "There seems to be hysteria at both ends of the issue -- 
those who claim that the Holocaust never happened and those who maintain that 
as many as 6 million people were killed." 
</P>
<P>
"The truth, many of us feel, is somewhere in the middle," Bless added. 
</P>
<P>
(Despite Bless's contention, the belief that Nazi Germany exterminated 6 
million Jews during World War II in death camps and other areas is widely 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-million figure is "based on much scholarly research since 1945, as well 
as on personal accounts and other documentation of that era. We consider that 
figure to be an accurate reflection of that tragedy," said Sam Eskenazi, staff 
spokesman for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, a federally created agency 
whose 65 members, mostly U.S. senators and congressmen, include Gov. George 
Deukmejian.) 
</P>
<P>
On the overall issue of stigma and guilt, Seewald viewed it this way: "There is 
no question of the horrors of that era. But many feel that such a debate over 
who was right and who was wrong can't go on forever. They believe there should 
be a time to put the past behind us -- and to start anew." 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the Phoenix Club was smaller than usual this February night, but 
the members there were no less spirited. 
</P>
<P>
The Karneval court royalty and entourage, resplendent in their formal attire, 
medals and feathered caps, were strolling around the dance floor. The Bavarian 
dance troupe -- the men in somber-hued shorts and vests, the women in flowing 
red dresses -- were high stepping their way though a rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't all conviviality and clubby camaraderie. The memories of the 
club's Nov. 10 celebration were proudly on display. 
</P>
<P>
The banner in German -- "Finally, Freedom for East Germany" -- still hung on 
the wall. Copies of German newspapers and photographs on the Berlin Wall 
opening were placed in the lobby cases. 
</P>
<P>
And on one table, like revered relics on an altar, were chunks of rock and 
cement. To club members these were more than souvenirs. They were symbols of 
reunion and rebirth. And of pride. These were pieces of the fallen Wall itself 
-- chiseled by Phoenix Club members in recent visits to Berlin.
