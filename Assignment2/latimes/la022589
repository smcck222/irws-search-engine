When a Pomona Ford dealer left a new model worth $20,000 parked next to his lot 
after closing hours with the keys in the ignition, it seemed like an invitation 
to steal. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what it was. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as three alleged thieves discovered, was that this Ford had a few 
glitches installed, at the request of Pomona police. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been experiencing a lot of thefts at dealerships," Detective Ray Birch 
said. "So we got together with the dealer's mechanic and rigged up a little 
surprise for them." 
</P>
<P>
The three suspects waited until the dealership closed at 10 p.m., Birch said, 
then jumped into the car and sped off. They sped all of about three blocks when 
the engine died. And the power door locks jammed so they couldn't get out of 
the car. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
"The arrests went very smoothly," Birch said. 
</P>
<P>
An eye for an eye, an artwork for an art. . .

That's the attitude of KFI-AM personality Tom Leykis, who announced Friday that 
he plans to organize a record burning of the music of Cat Stevens after the 
latter endorsed the Ayatollah Khomeini's death threat against novelist Salman 
Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to say something about that," said Leykis referring to the 
statement by Stevens, a converted Muslim who changed his name to Yusuf Islam 
and lives in England. 
</P>
<P>
However, Geoff Edwards, another KFI personality, blasted Leykis' plan on his 
own program and threatened to resign over it. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards "believes you don't burn and destroy artistic work . . . because that's 
exactly what the ayatollah is doing," explained Paula Schuster, Edwards' 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
Date and location of the record roasting have not been set, said Alan Eisenson, 
producer of Leykis' self-professed "combat radio" show. As a sort of warm-up 
Friday, Leykis played Stevens' hit "Peace Train" with machine-gun fire edited 
into the sound track. 
</P>

"Who was Stephen White?" was a not uncommon question around the corner of 1st 
and Hill streets in downtown Los Angeles where the statue of the 19th-Century 
U.S. senator stood for years. It was identified by nothing more than a 
nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
When the sculpture was moved up to 1st and Grand last year to clear it out of 
the way of Metro Rail construction, an explanatory plaque was added. Then, 
earlier this year, the statue was transferred to San Pedro in commemoration of 
White's campaign to win funds for Los Angeles' harbor there in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was unveiled this week. Meanwhile, the explanatory plaque remains at 
1st and Grand in Los Angeles . . . to mystify a new generation of passers-by. 
</P>

A Fighting-Fish Simulator Chair will be one of the curiosities at the Western 
Fishing Tackle and Boat Show in Long Beach next week. The would-be angler holds 
a fishing pole with a line that can be adjusted to impart as much pressure as 
that of a 1,000-pound marlin. But, warns show director Fred Hall, "you don't 
get your picture taken with a fish."

AL MARTINEZ: ALWAYS LEAVE 'EM LAUGHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By AL MARTINEZ

<TEXT>
<P>
I was in a place called Kinko's the other day making copies of some records for 
my tax man when I noticed a person copying a script and puffing furiously on a 
cigarette. The reason I noticed him is because the cigarette wasn't lit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to quit," he said when he saw me staring. There was a jittery 
quality to him that I assumed was caused by the sudden absence of nicotine in 
his system. I complimented him for working at giving up cigarettes. "Not 
cigarettes," he said. "I'm trying to quit writing for sitcoms." Then he laughed 
loudly and looked around to make sure everyone had heard him. 
</P>
<P>
The guy was a comedy writer and at the time was preparing a script to submit to 
"Roseanne," the new television series about crude fat people. I said that was 
very interesting and went about my business, satisfied to have limited our 
contact to those few peculiar moments. 
</P>
<P>
But then he said, "Maybe we can have dinner sometime." I had never seen him 
before in my life, and the likelihood of our having dinner together was remote. 
I didn't even know the man's name. I am, however, a civil human being and said 
sure, yeh, we certainly ought to do that, and he said, "Seven o'clock OK?" 
</P>
<P>
I said I was busy at 7 o'clock, finished copying my tax stuff and left. His 
last words to me were, "Seven o'clock is a lousy time anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
I mention the strange encounter only because the man was not untypical of 
people who write comedy, of which there are thousands in L.A. They are 
different than you and I, in touch with a vision one of them refers to as 
transcendental atticism, a state of mind he attains by staring through the 
screen of his word processor into its very soul. He claims to have actually 
seen a computer's soul once and says it resembles a gossamer and very beautiful 
microchip. 
</P>
<P>
By pointing out some of the eccentricities of people who write comedy, I do not 
mean to dismiss them as useless lunatics. They are a little loopy to be sure, 
but we owe them a great deal. More than once a comedy episode has lifted me 
from despair by the sheer lightness of the laughter it has stimulated. I don't 
rise from the couch singing madrigals exactly, but I do rise from the couch, 
which in itself constitutes a kind of psychic triumph. 
</P>
<P>
I discussed all this the other day at Junior's Deli with Martin Ragaway, who 
has been a comedy writer for 45 years and who has written about 800 shows for 
radio and television. He is the one, by the way, who asked the question during 
the Reagan Administration, "If anything happens to Nancy, will Ronnie become 
President?" 
</P>
<P>
Like so many comedy writers, Ragaway has about him the furtive manner of a 
hunted animal, as wary of the shadows as he is of the light. His moods range 
from gloom to an almost spiritual belief in comedy's healing qualities. On the 
one hand he is saying canned laughter has ruined the business; on the other he 
is offering to share his talent with any young comedy writer willing to tap 
into his experience. He is writing a book about the business, by the way, which 
he calls an unauthorized autobiography and which will offer anecdotes gathered 
over almost five decades. 
</P>
<P>
He tells, for instance, about a fellow comedy writer who considered his baby 
son too short. The writer took the infant to an orthopedic doctor who attempted 
to stretch him on a rack-like device meant for that purpose. When Ragaway asked 
if the treatment was helping the boy add height, the father replied, "No, but 
he's confessed to 300 crimes." 
</P>
<P>
During the dangerous, red-hunting McCarthy Era of the 1950s, Ragaway says, two 
men who wrote for the Bob Hope show were in Russia with Hope and thought it 
would be great fun to send him a three-month subscription to Pravda. "The 
loathing in the eyes of the mailman," Ragaway said, "was indescribable. I'm 
surprised I was never called to testify." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Twain said, "The secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow. There is no 
humor in heaven." That may be untrue now due to the new presence of comedy 
writer Lester White, who died last month of leukemia, but who in the spirit of 
one who reveled in life's absurdities did not die without a punch line. The 
story was first told to me by Ragaway and verified by White's son, Steve, a 
television executive. 
</P>
<P>
White, 77, was hospitalized and close to death but still had hope. "It ain't 
over," he was telling a hospital visitor, "until the fat lady sings." Just 
after he said it, an extraordinarily obese nurse entered his room with 
medication. White observed her for a moment and then with a timing perfectly 
equal to the occasion said, "Don't sing." What a way to go.

GREENING THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles and Inyo County can put an early end to more than two 
decades of legal struggles by agreeing on a long-term plan governing the city's 
water exports from the Owens Valley. It is in the best interest of both to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
An equitable conclusion to the affair will not make Los Angeles officials 
entirely happy, for they will not be able to pump as much ground water from the 
eastern Sierra valley as they would like, when they would like. But then 
nothing the city can ever do will make up for the clandestine manner in which 
it took the valley's water three-quarters of a century ago, and began to 
dominate Owens Valley affairs. Thad Taylor, a member of the Inyo County Water 
Commission, was right on both counts when he said recently: "One, we cannot 
turn back the clock. And two, Los Angeles is not going to go away." 
</P>
<P>
The latest legal skirmishes began in the early 1970s after the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power completed its second aqueduct to carry water from 
the Owens Valley and Mono County to Los Angeles. The city increased its pumping 
of ground water in the valley and the effect was immediately seen in dead 
vegetation and dry springs and artesian wells. Inyo County sued under the 
California Environmental Quality Act to require Los Angeles to justify its 
increased pumping in an environmental-impact report. It also adopted a 
ground-water management ordinance in an attempt to gain control over pumping. 
</P>
<P>
Each side scored victories of sorts. The courts rejected two city environmental 
reports as inadequate and imposed limits on pumping. Inyo's water ordinance was 
declared unconstitutional. In 1982 both sides agreed to attempt a negotiated 
settlement, leading in 1983 to a five-year interim agreement during which an 
attempt was to be made to mitigate environmental damage in the valley and to 
negotiate a conclusive agreement. The lawsuits were put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Now the armistice is ending. They must reach agreement by April 1 if they are 
to meet a court deadline to develop a joint environmental-impact report by June 
30, 1990. If the court approves their agreement, further legal action would be 
abandoned. Without an agreement, the city will be required to write a new 
impact report to justify additional pumping, or restrict its pumping to about 
one-fourth of capacity. Inyo would pursue its ground-water ordinance suit. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Owens Valley interests want Los Angeles to forgo any pumping that 
degrades the valley environment. This is not an unreasonable request and the 
city of Los Angeles would be hard-put to argue otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
The city also should consider a proposal to let water flow 50 miles along the 
now-dry Owens River bed before it is diverted back into the aqueduct at the 
southern end of the valley. This would require construction of a pumping plant, 
probably costing several million dollars. But using the river bed rather than 
the aqueduct for that stretch of the water's journey would allow restoration of 
riparian vegetation, waterfowl habitat and fisheries -- all items that would 
enhance valley tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The department makes millions of dollars in profit annually from its Owens 
Valley water and hydroelectric power operations, and economic development of 
the valley is severely limited because the city owns virtually all the 
developable property. What is most critical to Los Angeles is the water. The 
more amenable the city is to projects like the lower Owens River bed, the more 
willing Owens Valley residents are likely to be to share their water.

AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have been reading in our daily newspapers about Muslim fundamentalists 
demanding that America ban "The Satanic Verses." It has only been a few months 
since similar Christian fundamentalists were calling for the banning of the 
movie "The Last Temptation of Christ" right here in California. 
</P>
<P>
I think that both Christian fundamentalism and Muslim fundamentalism are two 
sides of the same dangerous coin. If it were up to these religious experts on 
everything, we would know nothing about real history, astronomy, organic 
evolution, or rationalism.

AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Satanic Verses" has created commotion and furor throughout the world. We 
think that this book is blasphemous, disparaging and totally baseless. 
</P>
<P>
What has enraged the Islamic world is that under the false guise of a novel, 
the book makes untrue and derogatory attacks on the Holy Koran, our Prophet 
Mohammed (peace be upon him), his wives, his companions and even on Prophet 
Abraham, who is the prophet of Jews, Christians and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
In October of last year when we learned that this book was about to be 
published by Viking-Penguin in the United States, we as an organization, and 
many individuals, wrote letters of protest to the publisher, requesting that 
the book not be published and warning of grave consequences should 
Viking-Penguin decide otherwise. All requests fell on deaf ears. Apparently the 
publisher was only interested in making money through the sale of this book 
without regard to the Muslim community's feelings, for which it is now facing 
the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
We demand that this book be stopped from further publication both in the United 
States and in England, and the author submit a written and public apology for 
writing this book. 
</P>
<P>
The West has always condemned terrorism. Terrorism can take many forms -- it 
can be the blowing up of buildings and airplanes, the killing of innocent 
civilians, the kidnaping of individuals, or writing malicious literature with 
"poisoned ink." Our organization condemns all forms of terrorism including the 
writing of this book. The civilized world believes that terrorists should be 
appropriately punished. We feel the same way about this author.

I've got my order in for a copy of "The Satanic Verses" and I'm pleased to say 
my bookseller tells me there is a long list of waiting buyers. 
</P>
<P>
I'll wait. It was 30-odd years before I finally got around to reading "The Last 
Temptation of Christ" and what a wonderful discovery it was. It taught me more 
about the profound meaning of Christ the man and myth than all the turgid 
sermons I ever heard before I finally gave up looking for any sense or 
spirituality in churches as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
I eagerly look forward to learning something about Islam that isn't filtered 
through the twisted megalomania of a power-mad old imam or, even worse, through 
the self-righteous "moderate" high priests who don't necessarily want to kill 
the author but would stop any of us from making our own choices by banning the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
And by the way, shame on those booksellers who so quickly ducked their heads in 
the sand.

IACOCCA ON THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
Iacocca neatly sidestepped a couple of subjects in his column. He offers no 
explanation of why truck tariffs are 10 times greater than car tariffs. 
Obviously, there would be no incentive to avoid this excessive (25%) tariff if 
it was anywhere near the level imposed on cars (2.5%). 
</P>
<P>
He also claims we don't send people to foreign countries to influence their 
governments. We just send clandestine CIA operatives to foment uprisings, 
influence elections, and incite assassinations. That's real meddling! Compared 
to that, foreign lobbyists are benign.

IACOCCA ON THE INFLUENCE OF FOREIGN LOBBIES IN WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"From Toshiba to Trucks, We're Being Run Over by Foreign Lobbies," screams the 
headline on Lee Iacocca's column (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 15). Iacocca complains that 
"every time foreign lobbyists in Washington jerk a string . . . the American 
government jumps." Iacocca contends that his complaint is not a tariff issue or 
a trade issue, but "who's got the power to change the" law of the United States 
if they don't happen to like it." 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca argues that the people we elect to make our laws, instead of being 
bought by foreign lobbies, should be bought by American lobbies -- that 
American interests should jerk the strings that make government jump. To this I 
say "the pox on Iacocca and his special-interest groups!" 
</P>

What we need instead is a separation of state and economy. Let there be no laws 
in the United States that interfere with free market exchanges between willing 
buyers and willing sellers -- regardless of race, sex or nationality. Without 
such laws there will be nothing to sell to lobbyists. Corruption in Washington 
will be vastly diminished. Our welfare will be vastly improved.

AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death threat by Iranian leaders against a British author, plus the sizable 
bounty to murder the writer, represents a serious challenge to Muslim leaders 
throughout the world. They have a choice to renounce this vicious example of 
terrorism or to remain silent and give the impression that such despotism is 
not inconsistent with Islam. 
</P>
<P>
Political democracies, especially Britain and the United States, are also 
challenged. Are they willing to permit interference with the artistic freedom 
of expression that has played such a central role in Western civilization? Our 
recent history suggests that such attacks on our basic values should not be 
ignored.

AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "No Safety Behind the Wall" (Feb. 15): 
</P>
<P>
I, of course, agree with your disgust at the bigotry represented by the conduct 
of many regarding "The Satanic Verses." But I was startled by your statement, 
"The Ayatollah Khomeini is no more a religious leader than was the Borgia 
Pope." That statement is simply untrue. Both men, by definition, are or were 
religious leaders. You also noted that, "Such squalid goings-on have as little 
to do with religion as they have with literature." Surely you have heard of the 
squalid, religion-based goings-on in the Middle East, Northern Ireland, 
Northern India, Pakistan, and the list could go on for pages. 
</P>
<P>
History teaches very graphically that religion, no matter what its bent, has 
never been a wellspring of tolerance for the beliefs of others. By its very 
nature, religion is an absolute. Honest education and a free society, with all 
of its imperfections, remain our only hope.

As a World War II front-line nurse in the admittance tent of an evacuation 
hospital in Europe, I have tried for many years to get Colorado congressmen to 
support a statue of the World War II combat nurses to no avail. Nurses 
volunteered, we were not drafted. Many men would have died if they had not 
received front-line care. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses on Corregidor suffered the most. I saw some at Fort Dix when they 
returned. I'll never forget the faces of these young women. Faces of wounded 
and dead servicemen still are in my mind after 44 years. We all suffered shock. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses deserve a statue for service in any war that a man has a statue erected 
to him. We helped to preserve democracy.

I have heard several of my fellow Muslims, both here in the U.S. and all around 
the world, call for the death of Rushdie. They have claimed that this book is 
blasphemous and that it has insulted the feelings and beliefs of all Muslims. 
While I do agree that the book is an attack upon my religion and that I do 
consider the book an insult to myself and to all Muslims, I still, however, 
consider the life of a human being infinitely more valuable than an insult. 
</P>
<P>
After all, with time, and through the deep love of our religion, injured 
feelings can be healed and insults forgotten. But a human life can never be 
brought back!

KINGS ARE BEATEN IN EDMONTON, 4-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EDMONTON, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he probably could have used two or three times as many, Edmonton 
native Kelly Hrudey requested only eight tickets for his debut Friday night as 
the Kings' No. 1 goaltender. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to rock the boat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably just as well because Hrudey and his new teammates were treated 
rudely by the Edmonton Oilers, who held Wayne Gretzky scoreless and beat the 
Kings, 4-1, before a crowd of 17,503 at the Northlands Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, who was held without a shot on goal for the first time this season, 
has yet to score a goal against his former teammates, and the Kings are 1-4 
against the Oilers, their probable first-round opponents in the National Hockey 
League playoffs, which start in less than six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the fine play of Hrudey, who was acquired Wednesday in a trade with 
the New York Islanders, could help the Kings, who haven't won a regular-season 
game at Edmonton in more than two years, losing six and tying one since last 
winning at the Northlands Coliseum on Jan. 7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
This one started to slip away in the first two minutes, when the Kings were 
penalized because Coach Robbie Ftorek sent out a different starting lineup than 
the one that had been announced. 
</P>
<P>
The two-minute bench minor wiped out a power play. 
</P>
<P>
It only got worse for the Kings after that. They gave up two power-play goals 
and a short-handed goal and failed to score during seven manpower advantages of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey gave up two goals in the first 10 minutes, including one on a shot that 
he probably should have saved, and said later that he was so nervous and unsure 
of himself that he didn't feel comfortable in his skates. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like I had foreign objects on my feet," said Hrudey, who later settled 
down and made several nice saves while facing 34 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey, who flew from New York to Los Angeles Wednesday and then from Los 
Angeles to Edmonton Thursday with his new teammates, appeared anxious even 
before a low-key practice Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't wait to get this first game over with and start to feel more 
acclimated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey said it would be wrong for the Kings to think of him as a savior, 
although Gretzky reportedly helped initiate the trade when he cornered Islander 
General Manager Bill Torrey at the All-Star game 2 1/2 weeks ago and inquired 
about the goaltender's availability. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just another piece in the puzzle," Hrudey said. "It's a team game. 
Obviously, we're a highly talented team, but we have to play as a unit and we 
have to show some chemistry because as I look around the (locker) room, there 
aren't a lot of guys who have been in this organization a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Does he feel pressured? 
</P>
<P>
"Who doesn't," said Hrudey, who is expected to provide a missing link for the 
Kings. "There's been a lot of hype. As much as you try to block it all out, you 
can't. You're always going to be subject to it." 
</P>
<P>
Especially now that he's with the Kings, who have given up more goals than all 
but two other teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey found out why in a hurry, when Edmonton's Craig MacTavish stole the puck 
from King defenseman Steve Duchesne along the right boards in the Kings' zone. 
MacTavish fed the puck to Charlie Huddy, whose shot from the top of the left 
circle deflected off Hrudey's pad and trickled into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The short-handed goal -- Doug Halward was in the penalty box for hooking -- 
gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead just 6 minutes 8 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton made it 2-0 at 9:53, again taking advantage of a mistake by the Kings. 
Actually, it was a pair of mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
First, a bench minor for having too many players on the ice gave the Oilers a 
power play. Then, Gretzky was unable to control a clearing pass in the Kings' 
zone. The puck glanced off his skate and was chased down by the Oilers' Jimmy 
Carson, who quickly passed to Esa Tikkanen. 
</P>
<P>
Tikkanen, streaking in from the right side, took the pass, juked Hrudey with a 
pretty move and tapped a short shot into the net. 
</P>
<P>
That goal, however, made up only part of Tikkanen's contribution. Described by 
Mario Lemieux of the Pittsburgh Penguins this season as the NHL's premier 
checker, Tikkanen this time hounded Gretzky, his former linemate, holding him 
without a point for only the sixth time in 61 games. 
</P>
<P>
How would Gretzky rate him? 
</P>
<P>
"By his performance tonight, he's got to be one of the best," Gretzky said. "He 
shut me down." 
</P>
<P>
And the Oilers shut down the Kings. The first period ended with the Kings 
trailing, 2-0, and in serious trouble. Edmonton is 17-0-1 this season in games 
it has led at the end of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Taylor finally scored for the Kings at 8:56 of the third period, but that 
only cut their deficit to 3-1. A power-play goal by Jari Kurri, who scored from 
in front off a pass by Mark Messier, had given the Oilers a 3-0 advantage at 
5:02 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Healy, suddenly the Kings' No. 2 goaltender, on reports that teammate 
Wayne Gretzky initiated the trade that brought Kelly Hrudey to the Kings from 
the New York Islanders: "I'm not going to hold it against Wayne. It disappoints 
me that 25 wins, with (18) games still to go, isn't enough. But when everything 
is all cut and dried, if it brings us the Stanley Cup, I'm not really going to 
mind so much. But it is discouraging." Only Mike Vernon of the Calgary Flames 
and Ron Hextall of the Philadelphia Flyers have won more games this season than 
Healy, who is 25-16-2. Mario Lessard established a club record when he won 35 
games for the Kings in the 1980-81 season.

SOCKERS HAVE GOOD TIME, ROUT SIDEKICKS 
</P>

<P>
There was a buzz in the Sports Arena throughout the Sockers' 8-2 victory over 
the Dallas Sidekicks Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was because of Waad Hirmez, who returned to town and kissed the floor 
when he was introduced before the game, then helped floor Dallas with a 
third-quarter goal that made it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe it was because of Victor Nogueira, who returned to the lineup after 
his wife gave birth to a girl Thursday and made three of the better saves of 
the year, robbing Richard Chinapoo late in the third quarter and stopping Mark 
Karpun on two breakaways in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Probably though, it was just the appearance of the Sidekicks that had everybody 
feeling good. The Sockers always seem to play their best when Dallas is in 
town, and on this night it was no different as the Sockers dominated every 
phase in front of 8,845 fans. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez, who spent the first half of the season with the Los Angeles Lazers, 
sparked an evening's worth of home-town entertainment when he knelt on his 
knees and kissed the floor during the pregame introductions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how much I missed San Diego," Hirmez said. "I was so happy to be back." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd, which seemed happy to have him back, went wild and then never really 
had a chance to settle down after that. 
</P>
<P>
Branko Segota scored just 5:45 into the first quarter when he surprised 
Sidekicks' goalkeeper Krys Sobieski by directing a re-start kick on goal. 
</P>
<P>
Sobieski was screened when Segota's shot arrived and had no chance to prevent 
the Sockers from taking a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Segota scored again 6 minutes later when he collected Ralph Black's shot off 
the boards and drilled home a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Segota, who now has 23 goals -- only one fewer than Zoran Karic, the team 
leader -- didn't play in the second half because of a bruised right thigh. It's 
unclear whether he will be able to play Sunday night against Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that the Sockers' didn't really need him in the second half 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chueden scored to make it 3-0, and then Hirmez struck a shot from the 
right boards that banked in off the far post. 
</P>
<P>
Hirmez, who scored three goals in first game back in a Socker uniform Thursday 
night in Los Angeles, ran to the boards and slapped high-fives with some fans 
after this one, his 15th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Alan Willey scored twice and even Paul Dougherty -- shut 
out at home since Jan. 2 -- scored once as the Sockers continued to have a good 
time. 
</P>
<P>
With eight goals as a backup, Nogueira did not need to be at his best Friday, 
but he was anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Every chance Dallas had of catching up were snuffed out. The Sidekicks, who 
failed to get a shot in the second quarter, put together some good second-half 
efforts but rarely produced. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cacho suffered a pulled left hamstring in the Sockers' 10-9 loss to Los Angeles 
Thursday night and is expected to be out two to four weeks. . . . Midfielder 
Brian Quinn, who suffered a strained left arch more than a month ago, said 
he'll be back this season, but he doesn't know exactly when. "It's just hard to 
say," Quinn said. "It doesn't feel to bad, but I just can't play yet." . . . 
Tatu, the Dallas' Sidekicks' leading scorer, missed Friday night's game with a 
sprained right shoulder. . . . Gordon Jago, the only coach the Sidekicks have 
had since the franchise was formed in 1984, also missed the game, but that's 
because it has been reported he will soon become the team's new president, 
replacing David Shutte. Sidekick assistant Billy Phillips, who is rumored to be 
Jago's replacement, coached the Sidekicks' in Jago's absence Friday night. . . 
. The Sockers will play the Los Angeles Lazers Sunday at 6:05 in the Sports 
Arena, then won't return home until March 10 to meet league-leading Baltimore.

STOLZ TO STAY WITH AZTECS, COACH GOLF;

<P>
HE'S REASSIGNED TO ASSIST KLEIN, WORK WITH MEN

Denny Stolz, fired as San Diego State football coach in November, will remain 
at the school as the men's golf coach. 
</P>
<P>
The reassignment was announced by Athletic Director Fred Miller in a news 
release late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz replaces Marty Maher, a part-time assistant who resigned Feb. 1 for what 
John Klein, SDSU director of golf, said were financial reasons. Klein said he 
will continue as director and coach the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said that although Stolz, an avid golfer, has never coached the sport, 
his general coaching background could help the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to have Denny with me," Klein said. "His coaching experience and 
philosophy will be a real asset to the program. Denny and I have had a good 
relationship since he has been coaching here, and nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Klein said he discussed the golf program with Stolz two weeks ago but did not 
learn of the reassignment until Friday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Miller nor Stolz could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
John Rosenthal, SDSU sports information director, said Stolz agreed to the 
reassignment and that he would begin his new job Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The move apparently ends negotiations between Stolz, 54, and school officials 
that began shortly after he was fired Nov. 14. The discussions had centered on 
how the university would honor the remaining three years of Stolz's contract, 
which was to pay him approximately $64,000 a year through February 1992, 
sources have said. 
</P>
<P>
Those sources also have said the negotiations included discussions of whether 
the university would be responsible for continuing other benefits Stolz 
received as football coach, including the use of an automobile and payments 
from equipment and other endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Stolz compiled a 16-19 football record at SDSU. He won the school's only 
Western Athletic Conference football title in 1986, his first as Aztec coach, 
but his next two Aztec teams finished 5-7 and 3-8. He was told of his dismissal 
with one game remaining in the 1988 season and was replaced after the season by 
Al Luginbill, former associate athletic director.

PADRES SHOULD PLAY AL OPPONENTS, TOO

<TEXT>
<P>
Clearly a unique team sport and acknowledged as America's pastime, I find major 
league baseball lacking an obvious dimension -- regular-season inter-league 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's "weaker sisters" (NBA, NFL, NHL) all seem to understand its appeal, 
but I've yet to see baseball address the issue, or for that matter, find the 
media discussing the topic. In lieu of the same old schedule, the Padres could 
add a home-and-home series with each American League team. Wow! Could you 
imagine all those American League teams in town? The 162-game season would 
still be honored but simply adjusted to accommodate its new personality. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the fans would love it, and consequently the owners would benefit from 
the increased attendance.

ELLIOTT'S PAC-10 MARK SHOULD GET AN ASTERISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While I agree that Sean Elliott is quite a basketball player and scoring 
machine, it would logically appear to me that either he, Reggie Miller and the 
other top Pac-10 scorers should have an asterisk by their records, or Lew 
Alcindor should have one. 
</P>
<P>
Alcindor made his record in three seasons, while the others took four. 
</P>
<P>
Fair is fair.

WITH RAVELING, USC BASKETBALL PROGRAM CONTINUES TO UNRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I like George Raveling. Always have. I admired his incredible success in that 
remote outpost, Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
But when Raveling charges that criticisms of his USC program are racially 
motivated, well, it shows that George is losing more than just ballgames. 
</P>
<P>
Within weeks of Raveling's arrival at USC, he forced three blue-chip players, 
two of whom are black, out of USC's basketball program. During his tenure, USC 
is 25-57, has finished in the cellar for two consecutive years, lost 13 
consecutive games this season and is a lock for finishing in the basement for 
the third year in a row. Bob Boyd, coaching year after year against John 
Wooden, was 216-131 at USC. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing. Despite John Thompson's Olympic setback, he has proved year in 
and year out that he can recruit and coach. But if Walt Hazzard is Raveling's 
idea of a great coach, he soon may join him on the sideline.

GOLF ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
CHIPS FALL FOR GLASSON; HE LEADS DORAL BY ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Glasson chipped in twice in a round of seven-under-par 65 that gave him 
to a one-stroke lead Friday at the halfway point of the $1.3-million Doral Open 
golf tournament at Miami, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The first of those chip-ins, from about 40 feet, "was pivotal for me," said 
Glasson, who chipped in for par on the third hole following a 3-wood shot into 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"When I made it, well, that kind of let me be more aggressive the rest of the 
way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also chipped in from 35 feet for an eagle on the eighth hole and completed 
two rounds over the windswept Blue Monster course at the Doral Country Club in 
136. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Levi was next at 137 after a 69, and Mark Calcavecchia, the first-round 
leader; Buddy Gardner; John Huston, and Fred Couples were at 138. Calcavecchia 
had a 73 that included a one-putt double bogey. Gardner shot a 68, and Huston 
and Couples had 69s. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Henning made a 50-foot chip shot on the 18th hole to join four other 
golfers in a tie for the first-round lead in the Senior Challenge at Naples, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Henning's chip-in, his second of the day, gave him a birdie and a two-under-par 
70, tying him with Miller Barber, Chick Evans, Gene Littler and Bruce Crampton. 
</P>
<P>
At Princeville, Hawaii, Betsy King and Jody Rosenthal slogged to two-under-par 
63s on a 16-hole course to take the first-round lead in the rain-plagued 
Women's Kemper Open. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains that washed away Thursday's first round and forced tournament 
organizers to shorten the $400,000 event from 72 to 54 holes also compelled 
officials to shorten the course from 18 to 16 holes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The par-3, 130-yard third hole and the par-4, 316-yard fourth hole both were 
covered with water following more than 12 inches of rain this week. 
</P>
<P>
A group of 11 golfers were one stroke behind the leaders.

DAVE DISTEL: GARVEY PROVES TO BE HUMAN, BUT IT'S NOT A LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it just me, or does it seem that what Steve Garvey is encountering 
hereabouts is a cross between the mentalities of National Enquirer and David 
Letterman? 
</P>
<P>
Is this Dallas, the slop opera, or San Diego, America's Finest City? 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have spent the past couple of days hiking in the back country, you 
know that the former Padre first baseman is in a pickle the likes of which he 
never encountered on the basepaths. He has, by his own admission, been accused 
by one woman of fathering her child and by another of impregnating her. All of 
this is complicated by the fact that he was married last weekend . . . to yet 
another woman. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a situation to brighten the day of any of the persons involved. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no humor here. The town is rampant now with Steve Garvey jokes. 
All are ribald or downright tasteless, the type of stuff that makes morning 
disc jockeys drool into their coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Let's try to take a look at a bigger picture with a bit more perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey is not the Wade Boggs of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a married ballplayer dragging equally married teammates into a 
quagmire of controversy after openly consorting with a mistress while on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey is not the Gary Hart of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a married politician running for president of the United States 
while engaging in a clandestine encounter in a Washington D.C., townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
However, as I see it, Steve Garvey is not the Steve Garvey of San Diego either. 
He has become is a mere mortal . . . a flesh-and-blood human being. If you are 
thinking that the Garvey image was too good to be true, maybe it was. Images 
can be mirages. 
</P>
<P>
Those who sympathize with the women involved, and it is hard not to, might 
argue that Garvey was being a typically opportunistic male. 
</P>
<P>
I hope this in no way sounds like an excuse for Garvey, because my calling in 
life is not to assess transgressions, but these were a single people behaving 
as single men and single women are sometimes known to behave. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, I would hate to try to estimate how many single men and single women 
were involved in just such activities within the past few hours, probably after 
exchanging a Steve Garvey joke or two. They are either right or wrong according 
to individual convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The problem here is that the public can become a monster in such situations. No 
prey is quite so tempting as an invulnerable target suddenly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, was Mr. Clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last week, in fact, a couple of family friends were extolling the virtues 
of Steve Garvey. They had met him at the Pro-Am at the Torrey Pines golf 
tournament and found him almost unbelievably cordial as he signed autographs 
and posed for pictures in the middle of his round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
This was a man headed for the Hall of Fame and political office, and it was a 
toss of a coin which came first. Though none of the revelations will have one 
iota of an impact on his inevitable election to the Hall of Fame, it is much 
too premature to guess what influence they might have politically. Again, 
that's not my department. 
</P>
<P>
The point, I suppose, is that this brouhaha has escalated as it has because 
Steve Garvey's situation is so much at odds with Steve Garvey's image. 
</P>
<P>
Let's back up to the concept that Garvey is, indeed, a human being rather than 
a larger-than-life individual so impeccable in character that he should have 
played baseball in a robe and halo. I bet he has occasionally had a drink 
stronger than milk and maybe even uttered an expletive stronger than darn (or 
even damn). 
</P>
<P>
From what I have heard the past couple of days, it almost seems that this man 
would not have been subjected to as much ridicule or sensationalism if he had 
peddled cocaine at a grade school. 
</P>
<P>
People, for some reason, really think this is funny. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly humorous to the people involved. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, consensual relationships existed between Garvey and the women in 
question, one of whom was his fiancee at one time. It is not for anyone to 
attempt to speculate about who was or was not responsible for what during these 
liaisons . . . or who did or did not make private promises. Those points seem 
moot anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
What Garvey has stressed is that he will accept whatever responsibility is his, 
presumably financially and otherwise. Potentially, this could stir more 
controversy, because the parties involved do not always agree on exactly what 
is an acceptable discharge of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of lives are being unfairly scrutinized, Garvey's not 
necessarily foremost among them. 
</P>
<P>
This is no way for the new Mr. and Mrs. Steve Garvey to start a life together. 
Candace Thomas, a Palos Verdes interior decorator, has been thrust into this 
ugly spotlight less than a week after becoming Mrs. Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
This is no way for the two former companions to start the lives they are 
starting. An unnamed San Diego women has given birth to a baby she says is 
Garvey's and Rebecca Mendenhall, the former fiancee, is carrying a baby she 
says is his. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way this whole situation should be treated either with bar room 
levity or media sensationalism. These are lives that have been touched . . . 
and hurt . . . by human beings being human.

FREMONT GAINS FINAL AFTER LATE RALLY STOPS EL CAMINO REAL, 66-63 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a guy has the hot hand, he'll do anything to get the ball. Wave his arms 
over his head, scream at his teammates . . . or tear it right out of an 
opponent's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Fremont High junior Adrian McCovey opted for the latter, which 
was just his way of saying, "Stand back, it's my turn. Please pass the 
leather." 
</P>
<P>
McCovey made three consecutive three-point shots in the fourth quarter as 
Fremont rallied from a 13-point first-half deficit to defeat El Camino Real, 
66-63, in a City Section 3-A Division semifinal playoff game at Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
McCovey averaged 5.2 points this season as a reserve off-guard. Friday night, 
when it was crunch time, he was Fremont's on-guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I've been saving it," McCovey cracked. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real never trailed until midway through the fourth quarter, when the 
cracks started to show. McCovey, who finished with 11 points, all in the fourth 
quarter, drilled a three-point basket with 5:30 left and was fouled in the 
process. He converted the free throw to cut a six-point El Camino Real lead to 
53-51. 
</P>
<P>
McCovey was just getting warmed up. On Fremont's next possession, he made 
another three-pointer to hand the team its first lead of the game, 54-53. And, 
convinced that he had found the touch to put Fremont in the City final, he 
ripped the ball out of Conquistadore guard Jason Farrell's arms when the latter 
was a little slow in surrendering the ball after an El Camino Real turnover on 
its next possession. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always told to be aggressive," McCovey said. "You have to want the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
You want it? You got it. 
</P>
<P>
Ten seconds later, McCovey nailed another three-point bomb to give Fremont a 
57-54 lead with 4:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
"I always give him three shots," Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan said. "I know after 
three shots whether he's on or not. He gets three shots and I don't say a word. 
If he misses, he's gone." 
</P>
<P>
And three shots was all McCovey needed to give top-seeded Fremont (25-3) its 
15th consecutive win. 
</P>
<P>
"We were doing fine until everybody got hot from three-point range," El Camino 
Real Coach Mike McNulty said. "That four-point play just absolutely killed us, 
momentum-wise." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (11-9) played perhaps as well as it could against Fremont for 3 
1/2 quarters. Led by senior forward Brent Lofton's game-high 34 points and 15 
rebounds, the Conquistadores jumped to a 25-11 lead midway through the second 
quarter and held a 30-26 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Without Lofton, El Camino Real may as well have stayed home. He often brought 
the ball downcourt, set up the offense, and then switched into the low post and 
pounded bodies inside. It was a chiropractor's nightmare for Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy wanted it so bad, he did everything in his power to win this game," 
Sullivan said of Lofton. "He carried them on his back all game, but I think he 
just got too tired." 
</P>
<P>
Lofton keyed El Camino Real's first-half surge with 16 points. Fremont was 
horrid during that span, making only nine of 30 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Sullivan said the deficit wasn't a curse, but more like a comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that after playing that terribly and only trailing by four that we'd be 
OK," Sullivan said. "No way we play the whole game like that." 
</P>
<P>
Yet behind Lofton, El Camino Real appeared poised to pull off the upset of the 
year in the 3-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lofton, who will attend Utah State in the fall, scored 12 points in the fourth 
quarter and gave El Camino Real a 51-47 lead on a jump shot with 5:37 left. 
Senior center Jason Steele made both ends of a one-and-one with 5:37 remaining 
to give the Conquistadores a 53-47 lead. Steele made only two of 10 free throws 
in the game, so it appeared the Conquistadores' chances were again on the 
upswing. 
</P>
<P>
But McCovey's three three-pointers keyed a 13-1 run that sent El Camino Real 
reeling. 
</P>
<P>
With a six-point lead and two minutes left, McCovey and a teammate showed some 
hot moves on the hardwood, too. The pair went into a prearranged victory dance, 
something choreographed just in case something like this happened. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Fremont moves its act to the big dance floor -- the Sports Arena.

SIMI VALLEY RUNS INTO A 'WALL' IN 2-0 SOCCER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Simi Valley High boys' soccer team had a shot -- more than a dozen, 
actually -- at reaching the Southern Section 4-A Division semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers, at home Friday against Hawthorne, rifled 13 shots on goal to the 
Cougars' five. None, however, counted. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne (17-9-2), conversely, made a pair of shots count to record a 2-0 
upset and hand the Pioneers (22-4-1) their first shutout since December. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, which trailed by two goals at halftime, kept intense pressure on 
Hawthorne goalkeeper Dana Lindleman throughout the second half and fired seven 
shots in a furious assault. 
</P>
<P>
Lindleman, however, got by with a little help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the whole team backing me up all the way," said Lindleman, who recorded 
his eighth shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Hawthorne's defenders stood in front of their netminder, forming a 
line of red-jerseyed bodies to deflect several Simi Valley offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Four times in the second half, the Pioneers fired from point-blank range. Four 
times they drew a blank. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Kinsley and Craig Hampton both headed balls sharply, but Lindleman made 
lunging saves. James Albin shot wide to waste another opportunity, and Matt 
Brill's attempt was smothered by players piled in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat their keeper," Simi Valley Coach Andy Silva said. "They just put a 
wall up in front of the goal. It won them the game." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, first-half goals by Sergio Medrana and Dennis Stone did the job. 
Medrana booted his, a 30-foot shot, past diving goalkeeper Dan Madsen at the 
25:30 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley midfielder Willie Ruiz and forward Brian Weaver each missed from 
close range before halftime. Ruiz, amid heavy traffic in front of the goal, 
fired wide to the left. Weaver gunned a left-footed shot that Lindleman 
smothered while sprawling to his left. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a couple of good shots on our keeper, but he made some good saves," 
said Hawthorne Coach Bud Regan, whose team advances to a semifinal match 
against Edison, a 1-0 winner over Chino in overtime. "When we scored the second 
goal, I figured it looked pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
With 1:10 remaining before halftime, Stone fielded a pass from Kenny Alexander 
and dribbled between two Simi Valley defenders before beating Madsen from less 
than 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, we were not the Simi Valley soccer team we have been all season," Silva 
said. "We didn't do what we normally do on the field."

USC KEEPS NORTHRIDGE WINLESS IN CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Price, Cal State Northridge's men's volleyball coach, said that it was a 
case of "could have, should have and would have," Friday night against USC. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge could have won, but it came up a little short every game as USC, the 
defending national champion, swept to a 15-11, 15-13, 18-16 victory in a 
Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. match at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
USC, ranked fifth in the nation, improved to 13-5 overall and 5-3 in conference 
play. Northridge, ranked 12th, dropped to 3-7 overall and 0-7 in the WIVA. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's loss follows last week's five-game defeats to UC Santa Barbara 
and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"We were good enough to win," Price said. "We've lost three close games to 
three of the top-ranked teams in the country. I guess we are the world's best 
0-7 team." 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors should have won the first game against USC after bolting to a 7-0 
lead. The Trojans, however, came back with nine consecutive points behind the 
front-line play of Tom Duke, Bryan Ivie and Leon Devaney and captured the game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge would have won the second and third games had the Matadors found a 
way to finish off the Trojans after tying them late in each game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge broke a 12-12 tie in the second game on a kill by Ron Graening. But 
after a sideout, USC ran off three consecutive points on a Northridge hitting 
error, a Northridge net violation and a kill by Trojan outside hitter Chris 
Martz. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 16-16, in the third game, USC went ahead when a ball 
deflected off the hands of Northridge's Andrew Greskovics. With Martz serving, 
Devaney put away match point with a kill. 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Bob Samuelson paced Northridge with 23 kills. Neil Coffman added 
15 kills for the Matadors and setter Tom Ribarich had 25 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Duke and Martz each registered 18 kills for USC and setter Dan Greenbaum had 68 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge continues its quest for its first WIVA victory tonight when it plays 
host to UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors will visit UCLA next week.

CITY FINALS GIVE DE JOHN LAST CHANCE TO TAKE A BOW

Dare the City Section wrestling championships script a play this corny? This 
bold? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. It would be too far-fetched. Too perfect. Too Hollywood. Too . . 
. . Sam De John. 
</P>
<P>
For De John, the man most often credited with bringing wrestling to the City 
Section some 17 years ago, a San Fernando High title this morning in his team's 
own gym is almost too much to expect. 
</P>

He's had his City championships -- six in all. He's had his individual 
champions -- 46 at last count. 
</P>
<P>
But today, on the eve of his retirement, De John will take a shot at one last 
shining moment. 
</P>
<P>
And he issues one final warning. 
</P>
<P>
"You can never count San Fernando out," De John promised. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. After a disappointing dual-meet season in which San Fernando won only 
one of five Valley League matches, the Tigers roared back for a second-place 
finish in last weekend's Valley League finals. 
</P>
<P>
"I concentrate on what happens at the end of the year," De John said. "So I 
have to swallow my pride and take my lumps during the year." 
</P>
<P>
And then dish it out at the close. 
</P>
<P>
The task today, however, appears formidable. El Camino Real, the defending City 
and Valley League champion, is strong. The Conquistadores won the league 
tournament handily and are heavy favorites today. Wilson, the champion from the 
Central League, also rates as a top contender. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has to come together and we have to have all the breaks," De John 
said. "We just can't compete against El Camino's depth. We never give up, but 
we're a long-shot." 
</P>
<P>
The odds are long but not impossible. Ten San Fernando wrestlers advanced to 
the City finals. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, we don't go head-up with El Camino where we're tough and 
they're tough," De John said. "They are strongest in the heavy classes, and we 
are in the light classes." 
</P>
<P>
But in what will be De John's final curtain call, he figures to go out a winner 
in at least one respect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we put on the best show in town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, Newbury Park and Channel Islands each qualified two wrestlers for 
this morning's Southern Section Masters Meet at Fountain Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
T. R. Merickel of Channel Islands and Chris Kilbane won their respective weight 
classes at 126 and 154 pounds, and Westlake's Neil Mason (145) and Billy Hunter 
(175) finished second in last weekend's 4-A Division championships. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, the Marmonte League champion, placed fifth in the team standings, the 
highest finish in school history. Newbury Park, which also qualified 
third-place heavyweight Jeff Jay, was eighth in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Valo Barajas (98) of Channel Islands and Bryan Ha (138) of Simi Valley each 
placed third and will also compete. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa will send three wrestlers who reached the 3-A Division finals to the 
Masters. They are Tony Flores (191), Robby Cook (132) and Wyatt Anderson (145). 
</P>
<P>
The top six wrestlers in each weight class at today's meet will qualify for the 
state championships March 4 at University of Pacific in Stockton.

EL CAJON'S PIERCE HAS PLAN FOR BIGGER, BETTER THINGS IN RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ask Ron Pierce something about his racing career, and he reaches into his 
briefcase and pulls out his self-prepared press kit. 
</P>
<P>
It seems Pierce, 20, has learned one important fact early in his career: You 
can't get to the top of your profession by just sitting behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, from El Cajon, has his resume ready in case he should run into any 
potential sponsors. Another fact of the sport: No sponsors, no racing. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Pierce hasn't had too much trouble attracting them. He has dominated 
the superlite class in off-road racing, winning more main events than any 
driver. He will be competing in the San Diego stop of the Mickey Thompson 
Off-Road Championship Gran Prix tonight at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The series is nothing new for Pierce, who won the overall superlite title two 
years ago and finished second last year. 
</P>
<P>
But if everything goes as planned on the 10-race circuit this season, he will 
leave superlite for bigger and better things. If there is one thing Pierce 
works on besides driving, it's planning. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce works full time for his father's plumbing business and spends his off 
hours contemplating his racing career. 
</P>
<P>
The first item on Pierce's resume: Career Goals . . . 1992 Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Pierce has listed what he has to do to get to Indianapolis. 
Somehow, things look more possible when they're in print. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my last year in superlites," Pierce said. "I've got to move on. For 
what I want to do, which is road race, I finally decided I have to move on and 
get in a bigger car." 
</P>
<P>
Getting into something bigger than superlite won't be too difficult. To get an 
idea, imagine strapping an engine with the approximate horsepower of a 
subcompact car onto a frame of lightweight steel tubing that is less than seven 
feet long. 
</P>
<P>
What you get is one of the more popular race classes with fans, especially 
women and children. Women like them because they are cute, and children enjoy 
them because they can relate to the size. On first glance, a superlite looks 
like something you would find in the toy section of a department store 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
But these are not toys. A superlite can reach speeds of 40 m.p.h. racing around 
the tight stadium courses. And every driver has experienced the thrill of 
flipping the 600-pound car. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing for Pierce this season is erasing the No. 2 on his 
car, which represents his finish in the point standings last season. Russ East 
won the championship. 
</P>
<P>
"After being No. 2, you want to get No. 1 back again," Pierce said. "You want 
to win, but you have to have that little extra to do it. Last year, I wanted to 
win, but I just didn't have that little extra." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce nearly pulled out the title at the end of the season. He would have had 
to get the best qualifying time, win his heat and win the main event in each of 
the circuit's last two stops. He pulled it off in Denver but fell short at Las 
Vegas, where he had the best qualifying time and won the main but finished 
third in his heat with a flat tire after crashing into a wall. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not going to race (superlites) this season and instead drive in the 
Barber-Saab Pro Series," Pierce said. "But my sponsor, Cal Bumper, asked me to 
drive again, and I would like to be known as the top driver in my class before 
I move up." 
</P>
<P>
Next season, Pierce plans on racing in the Barber-Saab. He hopes to make a few 
dollars on the circuit this year (he earned $6,000 two seasons ago and about 
$4,000 last season) and then figures to sell the superlite he built after last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A superlite costs around $12,000 to build. But the Barber-Saab series is run in 
bigger cars with a bigger price tags. 
</P>
<P>
The car is Indy style and about three-quarters the size of those used on the 
Indy circuit. The car gets its name from Skip Barber, who designed the vehicles 
using Saab engines. Each driver has the same car with the same engine, so 
driving ability and luck are the two important factors. It costs $5,400 per 
race to rent a Barber-Saab car, and that includes a mechanic. What it doesn't 
include is insurance. If a driver wrecks the car, and it was his fault, he has 
to pay for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
This venture is considerably more expensive than Pierce's first car. When he 
was 14, his father matched his $700 savings, and Pierce purchased an Odyssey, 
which is what the superlites used to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce went out and won his first race at Borona Oaks in 1983. He also won the 
Riverside/SCORE Off-Road World Championship in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce isn't exactly sure when he decided he wanted to race. He says he can't 
remember that far back. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather used to own half a sprint car and I'd go with him to all the 
races," Pierce said. "I just loved racing. I think I've wanted to race ever 
since I was born." 
</P>
<P>
There was one particular instance, however, that may have had an impact on an 
impressionable boy. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron Shuman (well-known sprint car driver) was my hero for about five years," 
Pierce said. "I had his posters in my room, and I joined his fan club. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 11, I was at a race in Arizona and the announcer kept saying Ron 
Shuman would be arriving. He was at a race back east, flew to Arizona and 
landed in a helicopter behind the track. He got out, won the main and left to 
fly back to another race. I said, 'Gosh, I'm going to be just like him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now that was planning.

USIU BEGINS ITS VERSION OF 'FEBRUARY MADNESS' AGAINST SAN DIEGO STATE TONIGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. International's game tonight against San Diego State at the San Diego 
Sports Arena is the start of its "playoff" season. For the Aztecs, it is little 
more than a late-season break from a Western Athletic Conference season gone 
sour. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls are approaching the 7:30 game as if it were the first half of a 
two-game playoff against San Diego's other NCAA Division I teams -- the Aztecs 
tonight, the University of San Diego on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It is an interesting way for USIU to end what Coach Gary Zarecky says is the 
best of his four seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The city rivalries have given his team something to play for when normally 
their season would be winding down. As an independent with a losing record 
(11-15), the Gulls have no chance at post-season play, but victories in these 
final two games could make their season, Zarecky said. 
</P>
<P>
The games will serve as a shortened city series. Scheduling difficulties 
prevented SDSU and USD from playing each other this season, the first time 
since 1978-79 that the teams did not meet. That leaves the Gulls to provide a 
late-season measuring stick between the programs. "In the past, by the time 
February hit, the kids realized they weren't playing for anything," Zarecky 
said. "This has given them a reason to get emotional about the end of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
Pardon SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg if he doesn't share Zarecky's enthusiasm. His 
team, too, has a losing record (11-14), but unlike the Gulls, the Aztecs can 
still qualify for post-season play by winning the WAC tournament. The game 
against USIU comes at time when Brandenburg would prefer to be preparing his 
team to play its final WAC regular-season games next week at New Mexico and 
Texas El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg said he would have preferred to play this game in December, along 
with his other non-conference games. 
</P>
<P>
"We play our games where the schedule says they fall," Brandenburg said. 
"That's all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
Both coaches expect a return to an earlier date next season. So Zarecky figures 
he might as well enjoy the opportunity while it lasts. He just hopes it works 
out more like the Gulls' 87-81 victory in 1986-87 than their 103-68 loss last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I don't want to happen is to be blown out," Zarecky said. "That 
did nothing to help our respect or credibility."

CORONADO GIRLS RALLY, REACH DIVISION IV FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado advanced to the final of the section Division IV girls' basketball 
playoffs with a 39-38 victory over Christian Friday at Granite Hills High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado will play the winner of tonight's Mountain Empire-Holtville game for 
the title. 
</P>
<P>
Christian (11-11) led, 26-13, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting going to the finals," Coronado Coach Ernie Dickerson said. "I 
wasn't especially pleased with our play. We fought back at the end and made 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The only time Coronado (13-12) led was with 7 seconds left, after a basket by 
Ijnanya Roberts. Julie Lochte scored 20 points for Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"Our press worked well the first half but they beat us on the boards. It was 
the second shot off of their rebounding that beat us tonight," Christian Coach 
Rod Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Erika Jonte scored 18 points for Christian and Stacy Patsko had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Division I quarterfinals 
</P>
<P>
Poway 65, Bonita Vista 45 -- Poway (19-9) jumped to 17-4 first-quarter lead en 
route to a 65-45 victory over Bonita Vista (21-6). The key to Poway's victory, 
Coach Jay Trousdale said, was the man-to-man pressure defense that forced 27 
turnovers. Laura Nugent led Poway with nine rebounds and seven blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans shot 54% from the field, led by Christy Fortney (19 points) and Dawn 
Gigstad (15). Torril Purvis scored 16 points and Colleen Gannon added 15 for 
Bonita Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Division II quarterfinals 
</P>
<P>
Mission Bay 53, Torrey Pines 48 -- Trailing, 14-8, after the first quarter, 
Mission Bay rallied to outscore visiting Torrey Pines, 16-2, in the second and 
then held on for the victory. Cristina Willis scored 23 points, and Bonnie 
Martin added 15 for Mission Bay (20-7). Torrey Pines (16-10) tied the game with 
3 minutes remaining, but Mission Bay again pulled away. Tiffany Booth led 
Torrey Pines with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 49, Castle Park 42 -- Castle Park led by seven with just over 3 
minutes to play, but multiple turnovers down the stretch held the Trojans to 
just one more point, while Oceanside rallied for 14 points to advance. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Tonya Lee scored six of her 17 points, and Keche Fowlkes 
six of her 10 for Oceanside (20-8). Mildred Conston added 11 points and 15 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Christina Murguia had 21 points and 26 rebounds.

ATLANTIC RICHFIELD PLANS TO SELL ARCO SOLAR UNIT, CITES POOR PROSPECTS FOR 
GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield acknowledged Friday that it is looking for a buyer for Arco 
Solar Inc., the subsidiary that Arco built into the world's leading producer of 
photovoltaic cells after buying a small solar firm amid much hoopla in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the growth of the solar market as unacceptably slow because energy 
prices haven't climbed nearly as high as some had projected in the 1970s, Arco 
said it is discussing the sale of all or part of Arco Solar with "a number of 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Among the potential buyers is James Caldwell, the former president of Arco 
Solar, who confirmed Friday that he took a leave of absence from the firm in 
mid-November to spend his time trying to line up investors. 
</P>
<P>
Arco officials and Caldwell declined to discuss details of any such 
negotiations or other suitors. But they apparently include foreign interests, 
possibly Japanese. Caldwell said he believed a sale will be concluded 
"relatively soon." 
</P>
<P>
Arco becomes only the latest of several oil companies to enter and depart the 
solar business. Exxon, Shell and Sohio have all dabbled in the potential for 
harnessing the sun's energy. British Petroleum, which bought Sohio, maintains 
an active solar business in England. 
</P>
<P>
Though there was skepticism in some quarters about the motives of oil companies 
getting into renewable forms of energy that could eventually compete with oil 
and gas, Arco dispelled such doubts and became a hero of sorts in the 
renewable-energy community. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been the notion among some people that oil companies would buy 
up the technology and then sit on it," said Robert Steele, analyst at the solar 
marketing and research firm Strategies Unlimited in Mountain View, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"But you certainly can't accuse Arco of sitting on the technology." 
</P>
<P>
A tiny part of the $17-billion oil, gas and chemical company -- the subsidiary 
rated one brief paragraph in the company's latest annual report -- Arco Solar 
benefited from the parent firm's infusion of cash and came to dominate what 
remains a small business worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Arco's proposed sale of the $30-million-a-year business -- 
particularly the possible sale to foreign interests -- has alarmed some 
advocates of renewable energy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a technology that's going to go the way of the VCR," said Edwin 
Rothschild, director of the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition in Washington. "It's 
outrageous that they would think of selling it to the Japanese, of all people." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Arco's leadership, the nation is already a net importer of solar 
thermal systems, a recent study by the General Accounting Office said. The GAO 
blamed cutbacks in federal funding of research and development for eroding U.S. 
leadership in photovoltaics technology. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is strong in solar technology, both for industrial and consumer use, and 
boasts perhaps half a dozen companies that might want to buy Arco Solar, Steele 
said. Among them is Arco Solar's joint-venture partner Showa Shell. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell argued that the sale will be good for both Arco and Arco Solar because 
the oil company management was unable to devote the attention that the solar 
unit needs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, I believe this is going to prove to be the correct 
decision, from the standpoint of Arco and Arco Solar," Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the photovoltaic industry in this country is in jeopardy," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Arco Solar has never turned a profit because of the high proportion of 
research-and-development outlays to sales, Caldwell said. But he said the 
business "can be made profitable in the short term." Up to 40% of revenues are 
plowed back into R &amp; D.

DISCOUNT RATE INCREASE JOLTS STOCK MARKET; DOW FALLS 43

<P>
The Federal Reserve Board's hike in the discount rate jarred the stock market 
Friday, slicing 43.92 points from the Dow Jones industrial average and closing 
out the market's worst week since August. 
</P>
<P>
Selling gathered momentum through the session as some investors fretted that 
the half-point rise in the discount rate wouldn't be sufficient to halt 
inflation and others worried that future rate increases might finally choke off 
the long economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
It was the market's second sharp fall in three sessions, leaving the Dow off 
79.28 points, or about 3.4%, for the week, closing at 2,245.54. The Dow lost 
42.50 points on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The market's recent slide has eaten up a good chunk of the gains that stocks 
achieved in January. The widely watched Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index 
had gained about 5.6% in value from Jan. 1 through the trading Thursday, but it 
lost about 2% of that in Friday's slide, said James D. Wright, chief investment 
officer at Banc One Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"It was steady pounding, across the board," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a number of analysts said Friday's tumble could have been worse, 
considering the week's difficult economic news. And they saw much bullish 
sentiment remaining in the market. 
</P>
<P>
They cited the general strength of corporate earnings and the momentum of a 
national economy that has been virtually unaffected by the interest rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the sort of knee-jerk reaction the market frequently has to interest 
rate moves, but we think it may come out of it strongly," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Nicoski, market analyst with the Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood 
brokerage in Minneapolis, said his firm has recently advised clients to put up 
to one-quarter of their portfolios in cash. Only last month, Piper Jaffray was 
recommending that clients put 100% of their assets in the stock market, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nicoski said the firm is concerned that the market has hit a "violent air 
pocket" because of worries about inflation and how well the Fed will be able to 
handle it as it simultaneously struggles to remedy the thrift crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"This air pocket may last longer than some people anticipated," he said. "But 
in a few weeks, we may be out of it and heading back north." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene J. Peroni, market analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, 
said he expected that the Dow would fall to about 2,100 from the post-crash 
high of 2,347.14 that it reached Feb. 7. But after a weak period that may last 
through March, the bull market will re-emerge, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Peroni pointed out that recently there has been a change in how the market has 
reacted to interest rate hikes. The market absorbed news of rate hikes with 
"reckless abandon" last year as it recovered from the October, 1987, crash and 
was buoyed by strong corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honeymoon May Be Over 
</P>
<P>
"The market's now reacting more violently to rate rises than it has in some 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investors had long expected a rise in the discount rate, which was lifted to 7% 
from 6.5%, and initially Friday there was little reaction to the Fed's 
announcement. But the selling increased with computer-assisted trading, which 
continued fitfully through the session. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, volume was moderate, with 160.68 million shares traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange, compared to 150.37 million Thursday. Declining issues 
outnumbered gainers by a 7-to-2 margin. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;P 500 index fell 4.92 to 287.13, as the NYSE composite index lost 
2.37 to 161.72. The average share price was off 49 cents on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Peroni said the Senate Armed Service Committee's negative vote on John Tower's 
nomination to be defense secretary might have been a "secondary factor" in the 
day's trading. "A lot of people in the market have focused on their hopes for 
this Administration, and it looks like the honeymoon may be ending." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing Issues Off 
</P>
<P>
The stock selloff was felt across most sectors. Among the blue chips, 
International Business Machines fell 2 1/4 to 121 1/8, American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph lost 3/4 to 29 3/4, Eastman Kodak skidded 1 1/2 to 46 5/8 and 
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing slid 1 5/8 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
Bethlehem Steel gave up 1 1/8 to 25, Merck lost 1 1/8 to 62 3/8 and Du Pont 
fell 2 1/8 to 95. 
</P>
<P>
Companies in the housing and auto industries, always hurt in rate rises, were 
hit hard. General Motors was off 2 1/2 to 84 1/4, Ford tumbled 1 3/8 to 51 3/4 
and Chrysler gave up 1/2 to 25 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Home fell 1/4 to 1 7/8, Kaufman &amp; Broad Home slid 1/4 to 15 3/4 and 
Centex gave up 3/8 to 27 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among the gainers, Emhart jumped 7 1/8 to 39 7/8, substantially above the $35 a 
share offered by Topper L.P., a partnership consisting of the Fisher real 
estate family and oil heir Gordon Getty. 
</P>
<P>
In the airline industry, UAL fell 2 3/4 to 125 1/4, AMR lost 1 1/8 to 59 7/8, 
Southwest Airlines eased 3/8 to 23 3/8 and Delta was unchanged at 56 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
The airline sector's big gainer was NWA, which has been the subject of takeover 
speculation. Its shares rose 3 5/8 to 72 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Among issues on the American Stock Exchange, New World Entertainment was up 1/2 
to 5 1/2 on news that it will be acquired by Pathe Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
California Energy dropped 3 7/8 to 16 7/8. The Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
investment firm issued a recommendation to sell the stock, saying there were 
"numerous claims" on the revenue from its main geothermal project. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the Financial Times 100-share index ended the day 2.9 points, or 
0.1%, higher at 2,019.5. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed Friday for the 
funeral of Emperor Hirohito.

MANY FIRMS HAVE BOOSTED FEBRUARY MAGAZINE AD BUDGETS TO CASH IN ON BLACK 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This month -- weeks after most magazines have shrunk to normal size following 
the end of the heavy Christmas advertising season -- many black-oriented 
publications such as Ebony, Essence and Black Enterprise are fat with ads, 
thanks to the designation of February as Black History Month. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to garner good will from the nation's black consumers who spend an 
estimated $240 billion annually, many of the country's biggest advertisers -- 
including Anheuser-Busch Inc., AT&amp;T, Burger King, Miller Brewing Co., 
Eastern Airlines, McDonalds and Coca-Cola -- have taken out full-page ads in 
black magazines and newspapers touting the achievements of black historical 
figures and celebrating black history month. 
</P>
<P>
"The February issues of most magazines tend to be thin issues after the heavy 
spending from September through December," explained Clarence O. Smith, 
president of Essence Communications Inc., publisher of the black women's 
magazine Essence. "If it were not for Black History Month, we, as well as other 
black publications, would do a lot less well in February." 
</P>
<P>
The February issue of Ebony contains at least 10% more advertising than the 
December issue and is the largest behind the special August issue of Ebony, 
said Dennis Boston, vice president of advertising. The February Black 
Enterprise, with 244 pages, was more than twice the size of the 100-page 
December issue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the special advertising efforts have boosted the economic fortunes of 
many black advertising agencies and black publications, some black historians 
complain that the educational value of the campaigns may be suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility exists for exploitation . . . because these companies are 
engaged in business to make money," said Karen A. Robinson, executive director 
of the Assn. for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, a 
Washington-based group that founded Black History Month. "They are not 
historians. I think a better way for Black History Month to be celebrated would 
be for corporations to work with organizations like ours that have some 
expertise in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Black historical achievement has been publicly recognized each year since at 
least 1926, when historian Carter G. Woodson started Negro History Week. But 
corporations did not embrace the observance as a marketing tool until they 
began hiring black advertising agencies in the 1970s, said Ken Smikle, editor 
and publisher of Target Market News, a Chicago-based trade publication that 
follows the black consumer market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awards, Scholarships 
</P>
<P>
The trend gained momentum in 1986, Smikle said, with the designation of Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s birthday as a federal holiday. As a result, he said, more and 
more of the $700 million advertisers spend annually to reach black consumers -- 
out of the $24 billion in total ad spending -- is showered on black 
publications between January and February. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, companies such as Miller, McDonalds and Coca-Cola spend millions 
more in promotions and sponsorships aimed at black consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Coke, for example, will award more than $130,000 in college scholarships 
through Coca-Cola's "Share the Dream" scholarship sweepstakes that run in 
conjunction with Black History Month, said Charles Morrison, vice president of 
black and Hispanic consumer markets. 
</P>
<P>
While the advertisers emphasize that they market to black consumers throughout 
the year, they say they make special efforts during February in order to 
maintain awareness of their products as well as enhance their reputations as 
being sensitive to the black community. 
</P>
<P>
"These ads are not intended to sell products," said Ivan Burwell, Coors 
national program manager. "I simply see it as a recognition by Coors of the 
importance of the black consumer market. It certainly is an honest and sincere 
effort to recognize black achievement." 
</P>
<P>
However, historians complain that many ads avoid controversial political 
figures in black history. 
</P>
<P>
Although at least two recent ads mention Black Muslim Malcolm X, most highlight 
inventors or pre-colonization African royalty. An AT&amp;T advertisement 
depicts inventor Lewis Latimer, for example. Similarly, an Eastern Airlines ad 
features African kings. 
</P>
<P>
Historian John Henrike Clarke, a professor emeritus of African History at 
Hunter College in New York who has written or edited 25 books on black history 
and served as a historical consultant to companies that do Black History Month 
advertising, says that while some of the ads expose Americans to information 
they might not otherwise be aware of, some of the efforts at black history are 
"superficial." 
</P>
<P>
"In general, these are not benevolent efforts; they are mostly public 
relations," Clarke said. "I'm not saying they are evil in any way. Its just 
that they have their own self-interest, which is to sell more of their products 
and services. As a result, they cite the safe historical figures. They don't 
cite . . . ones like Marcus Garvey because they don't want to cause trouble." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1926 as "Negro History Week" by historian Carter G. Woodson, Black 
History Month attempts to spotlight the influence of blacks on history. The 
seven-day tribute was expanded to all of February in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The observance is sponsored by the Assn. for the Study of Afro-American Life 
and History, a Washington-based group of about 200 historians founded by 
Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's observance is "The Role of Afro-American Churches in 
Economic, Political and Social Development at Home and Abroad."

HOME SAVINGS SEEKS TO SWITCH DEPOSIT INSURERS; 
</P>
<P>
NATION'S BIGGEST THRIFT PREFERS FUND FOR BANKS OVER AILING AGENCY FOR S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Home Savings of America, the country's biggest thrift, said Friday that it is 
seeking approval to drop its membership in the Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
Insurance Corp. and to join the deposit insurance system for commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based financial institution indicated that the move was sparked 
by the Bush Administration's plan to increase levies on thrifts to help fund 
hundreds of S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
The move underscores the turmoil surrounding FSLIC, an insolvent government 
agency that gets its funds from the nation's 3,000 federally insured savings 
and loans. FSLIC's job is to rescue troubled thrifts and protect deposits up to 
$100,000 per account. 
</P>
<P>
Home Savings has joined a growing group of healthy thrifts in California that 
are signaling they want to leave the FSLIC system and to receive coverage 
instead from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"This is their way of saying of saying: 'We're mad as hell and won't take it 
any more,' " said Allan Bortel, a financial analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been fed up for a long time," agreed a spokeswoman for Home Savings. 
</P>
<P>
Two other thrifts that want to drop their FSLIC insurance in favor of FDIC 
coverage are Great Western Financial in Beverly Hills and Home Federal Savings 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue plan proposed by Bush, estimated to cost anywhere from $126 billion 
to more than $300 billion, is to be financed largely by U.S. taxpayers and the 
thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
To come up with the money, annual thrift premiums will be temporarily increased 
from 21 cents to 23 cents on every $100 of deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the larger the thrift, the larger the premium that it will have to pay. 
Home Savings has deposits of nearly $30 billion and more than 350 offices in 
nine states. 
</P>
<P>
Its size means that the firm "will be forced to bear the largest cost burden to 
resolve the problems of the FSLIC -- problems we did not create," Home Savings 
Chief Executive Richard H. Deihl said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
FSLIC has traditionally insured deposits at savings and loans, while the FDIC 
insures deposits at commercial banks. Though thrifts have specialized in 
mortgage lending and banks in business loans, those differences have become 
increasingly blurred in recent years as banks and thrifts have begun making the 
same kinds of investments. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the FSLIC, the FDIC is solvent and charges its members far less for 
deposit insurance. Deihl said Home Savings paid nearly $50 million for deposit 
insurance in 1988 -- double what it would have paid if it were FDIC-insured. 
</P>
<P>
One potential roadblock to Home Savings' plan is that the Bush proposal, which 
must be approved by Congress, would bar shifts from FSLIC to FDIC for five 
years. The five-year ban would extend a moratorium mandated by Congress that is 
scheduled to expire in August. 
</P>
<P>
Home Savings officials believe that they would qualify for a "grandfather" 
exemption to the extension because the firm indicated nearly two years ago -- 
before the Congressional ban went into effect -- that it might apply for FDIC 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
If regulators find the grandfather exemption to be valid, "then I assume they 
will be allowed to leave," said Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the Federal Home 
Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
To effect the change, Home Savings has applied for permission to merge its 
operations into its wholly owned Bowery Savings Bank, which is based in New 
York and is already insured by the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
The move is similar to an application filed last October by Great Western 
Financial, which wants to merge its FSLIC-insured operations in California, 
Florida and Arizona into its FDIC-insured holdings in the state of Washington. 
A Great Western spokesman said the application is pending.

SANTA ANA MAN CONVICTED ON 27 LOAN FRAUD COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury in Los Angeles has convicted Orange County businessman 
John F. Hayden of defrauding Bank of America and 21 other financial 
institutions by issuing millions of dollars in worthless loan guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
The jury on Wednesday convicted the Santa Ana resident of 27 fraud counts but 
acquitted him of one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. On 
Friday, the jury was unable to return a verdict on a single count of 
conspiracy. U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp declared a mistrial on the 
conspiracy charge and dismissed it, according to an FBI spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In an 11-week trial, prosecutors alleged that Hayden used Glacier General 
Assurance Co. of Montana -- of which he was president -- to induce lenders to 
make millions of dollars in real estate loans that were never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
Glacier, which had an office in Tustin, did that by guaranteeing repayment of 
the loans. When the loans later turned out to be fraudulent, Glacier was unable 
to make good on its guarantees and was declared insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
The persons who received the loans never used them to market a proposed 
condominium project in Oregon or to build homes in Chatsworth, as was intended 
by the lenders. Instead, they diverted millions of dollars into their own 
accounts, prosecutors alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Among Hayden's victims, prosecutors said, was giant Bank of America, which sued 
Hayden and others in what it alleged was a scheme to swindle $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said loans from 22 lending institutions were involved in the fraud. 
Hayden was first indicted with six other men in 1986. All but one have been 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI spokesman said Friday that Hayden's defense attorney has made a motion 
for a new trial on the the 27 counts of fraud.

IT'S NOT SO 'BAD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Michael Jackson is truly disenchanted because "Bad" did not outsell 
"Thriller," he should look at his unrealistic expectations rather than at Frank 
Dileo ("Pop Star Jackson Fires His Manager," by Patrick Goldstein, Feb. 15). 
</P>
<P>
He might also look at quality. Although "Bad" is a solid album, one of the best 
of the last few years, it certainly is no "Thriller." One listen to "Billie 
Jean" or "Beat It" should remind him of that. 
</P>
<P>
If Jackson were to talk with Prince, Fleetwood Mac, or Peter Frampton, he would 
be overjoyed with "Bad's" sales and ability to stand on its own. After all it 
could have gone the way of the follow-ups to their mega-selling albums. Does 
anybody remember "I'm in You?"

CRUISE AND QUAYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was enormously insulted by Greg Morrison's suggestion that Tom Cruise 
obviously accounts for the popularity of "Rain Man" with female audience 
members. ("What's Driving 'Rain Man?' Women," by Nina Easton, Calendar, Feb. 
10). 
</P>
<P>
Isn't this reminiscent of some members of the Republican Party suggesting a 
cute vice presidential candidate like Dan Quayle would attract women voters and 
close up the gender gap? I don't mean to suggest Tom Cruise in any way 
resembles our vacuous VP, but I went to "Rain Man" because of the subject 
matter and Dustin Hoffman's brilliance as an actor.

PRAISE FOR THE RAPPERS' BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I admire the position taken by the three rap acts in boycotting the Grammy 
Awards ("Grammy Nominees in Rap Promise Boycott," Feb. 10). I wished in past 
years that the jazz artists and jazz labels had the courage to do the same. For 
years, I had fought with the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences 
to include at least one jazz artist on the telecast, but they couldn't be 
bothered with jazz -- ironically, when Mike Melvoin, a self-professed jazz 
musician, was president of NARAS. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't sour grapes as far as winning Grammys, because I had produced on 
Verve and Pablo Records 22 Grammy-winning albums (with Ella, Basie, Dizzy, 
Oscar Peterson, et. al.). It was insulting that artists of this importance and 
quality were not given the same telecast exposure as pop and rock artists and 
in frustration I resigned from NARAS, having been a member since its inception.

As your report stated, Pierre Cossette is still coming up with the same tired 
excuses that there are too many categories; thus, he cannot find room for rap 
nominees, as he couldn't for jazz. Cossette and NARAS continue to equate 
quantity of sales with quality of music. 
</P>
<P>
Once again my hat's off to the rappers, who in their first year on the Grammy 
Awards conducted themselves with dignity.

The Academy Awards spectacle is getting more predictable each year, so much so 
that the bottom-line is now "Who cares?" 
</P>
<P>
Where are "The Thin Blue Line," "Wings of Desire," "Dominick and Eugene" and 
"Bagdad Cafe"? 
</P>
<P>
To say that the Oscars determine what the best films in America are is like 
saying that George Bush is the best-qualified person to run the country because 
he won the election.

SOVIET CELLIST GUTMAN IN PHILHARMONIC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, Times Music Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the current illness of composer/conductor Oliver Knussen intervened, the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic program at the Music Center this week contained three 
first performances as well as major works by Shostakovich and Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday night's event at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, with assistant 
conductor Heiichiro Ohyama substituting for the indisposed British musician, 
Shostakovich (the Second Cello Concerto) and Stravinsky ("Firebird" Suite) 
remained. But the premieres still await exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Ohyama led the first of three performances of this agenda, now including 
Mussorgsky's Prelude to "Khovanshchina" and Elliott Carter's Elegy (the 
scheduled premieres had been by Knussen and Carter). The auditorium was not 
full, but those who attended expressed approbation, at least at the ends of the 
larger pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Philharmonic played strongly, and with a full palette of dynamics. 
It sounded better, in fact, than Ohyama's sometimes tentative gestures looked. 
</P>
<P>
After a timid run-through of the Mussorgsky excerpt, the 41-year-old 
violist/conductor gave Natasha Gutman solid and informed support in the 
depressed and depressing rhetoric of Shostakovich's virtuoso lament. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Soviet cellist made all its tricky and complicated passages seem 
easy, one's attention could be fully focused on the work's thoroughgoing 
sadness. Through even its fast and loud perorations, this basically muted solo 
piece manages to sap the energy of its performers and auditors. 
</P>
<P>
In her Philharmonic debut, the 47-year-old Gutman produced as wide a range of 
expressiveness as may be possible in this work, and with a thorough economy of 
means as well as genuinely imperturbable technique. After the quiet, receding 
closing bars of the dance-on-the-grave finale, the audience went to the other 
extreme with noisy approval. 
</P>
<P>
There was poetry as well as noise in the Philharmonic's polished playing of the 
"Firebird" excerpts. If Ohyama's reading offered nothing new or distinctive, it 
gave full value to the well-known virtues already present in the score. 
Preceding the Stravinsky suite, the conductor drew lush and motivated playing 
from the Philharmonic strings in Carter's 50-year-old Elegy, a relic that reeks 
charmingly of the 1930s.

SEDUCTIONS RAMPANT IN CBS' 'NAKED LIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Naked Lie" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8) has a basic appeal to 
voyeurs and betrayed women. It's populated with a corrupt judge (James 
Farentino), a lovesick prosecutor (Victoria Principal), sleek call girls and 
assorted denizens of law, order and vice. 
</P>
<P>
Writers Timothy Wurtz, Glenn Benest and John Bensink dart right to the point: a 
gorgeous blonde with a long-stemmed rose enters a fancy hotel, Farentino passes 
her in the bar, and seconds later he is unrolling her silk stockings in the 
penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you exactly what to do," he lasciviously whispers, wearing only 
black shorts. She chews on his fingers (it gets much steamier) and then -- 
flash! click! The woman's pimp materializes out of the shadow, a Polaroid 
picture in hand. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody said blackmail was easy. The lamp-wielding judge kills the hooker, 
and the pimp is tried for the murder. 
</P>
<P>
The fun, as in trash that glitters, is watching Farentino preside over a trial 
in which he's the killer. But the emotional lark is the unwitting Principal. 
She's not only the judge's secret lover, ignorant of his affliction for sex for 
hire, but -- in a delicious conflict of interest -- the D.A. assigned to his 
courtroom to nail the pimp (Jack Ross). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, director Richard Colla and his cinematographer, Ron Garcia, enfold 
the cad of a judge and his love-smitten D.A. in endless silken shots of 
lingerie, thighs and groping hands. Farentino is not an actor you expect to see 
enact emotional devastation, but his breakdown at the conclusion is unflinching 
and even wracking. Principal (who was co-executive producer) trembles in her 
awakening, gleams in her despair. 
</P>
<P>
Glossy production values mirror the sheen of San Diego watering holes. The 
credited Chamber of Commerce can be happy. Now if they can just keep those 
hookers off the streets. RAY LOYND

'DAUGHTER' KEEPS SOPPY SENTIMENT AT BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Macauley's Daughter" (on cable's Disney Channel at 9 tonight) is meant to be a 
heart-warming tale of father-and-daughter bonding, but it takes time to warm up 
to this Bryan Brown vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the respected Australian actor whose most recent film credits include 
"Gorillas in the Mist" and "Cocktail," plays Macauley, a '40s drifter in the 
outback, surviving on side-show boxing matches and ranch work. 
</P>
<P>
When he's suddenly saddled with his 7-year-old daughter Buster (Rebecca Smart), 
it cramps his style. It is obvious, however, that Mac will succumb to Buster's 
spunkiness and loyalty. The only mystery is how long it will take. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Mac stuck with Buster? Because, while on the rebound from Lily (Noni 
Hazelhurst), he married Marge (Lorna Lesley), spent six months with her, then 
took to the road. When he returned seven years later, he found Marge with 
another man, was outraged and took Buster out of spite. 
</P>
<P>
Although director George Ogilvie's avoidance of soppy sentiment is to be 
applauded, viewers have a problem: how to like angry, cold Mac for the first 
half of the film. 
</P>
<P>
For at least an hour he seems little better than a kidnaper. It would help if 
Tony Morphett's script (based on D'Arcy Niland's novel "The Shiralee") let us 
know sooner that Marge is really an unfit mother. 
</P>
<P>
When Mac finally does start warming up, it's a credit to Brown's powerful gifts 
as an actor that he makes the turnabout so convincing. The remarkable young 
Smart, with her freckled, pixie face and brash mouth reminiscent of Tatum 
O'Neal in "Paper Moon," makes no small contribution to the chemistry between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long wait, though. LYNNE HEFFLEY

'REVENGE OF CAPONE' RIDDLED WITH CLICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Revenge of Al Capone" (Sunday at 9 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39), a new 
made-for-TV movie, takes up where the hit theatrical film "The Untouchables" 
left off -- with the heinous title gangster on his way to a stiff prison 
sentence on a tax evasion rap. 
</P>
<P>
It seems, however, that not even prison will stop Capone's reign of terror in 
the Chicago underworld, as old Scarface himself continues to rule the mob with 
an iron fist from his rather unsupervised prison digs. Who will step into the 
fray and stop the madness? Good old Eliot Ness, we presume? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, Uzi-breath. This is a TV ratings "sweeps" period, after all, and Ness' 
sacrosanct popular legend is just a tad too squeaky-clean to allow him to play 
protagonist when teaser commercials full of steamy sex are what's called for. 
Thus, in this version of the tale, Ness (played by Scott Paulin) is only a 
supporting character -- and seen as an uptight, by-the-rules sycophant of J. 
Edgar Hoover whose "prima donna" rigidity stands in the way of true justice. 
</P>
<P>
The "real" hero: Fellow Treasury Dept. special agent Michael Rourke (Keith 
Carradine), who is no less righteous in his abhorrence of corruption but who 
isn't above jumping into the sack with a seemingly sweet gun moll (Debrah 
Farentino) for a little prime-time adultery. Rourke will pay for his 
indiscretion, of course, but not before the ratings points are in. 
</P>
<P>
"Revenge" intends to be taken as ironic romantic tragedy as well as bloody 
gangland saga, and comes up short all over. In Tracy Keenan Wynn's perfunctory 
script (directed by Michael Pressman), Rourke's deteriorating marriage and 
family life is sketched in much the same way as his blossoming affair with a 
speakeasy hostess: briefly, and entirely in cliches. 
</P>
<P>
What's most needed, of course, is a galvanizing Capone capable of inspiring 
obsession on either side of the law -- a la the bat-wielding Robert De Niro of 
"The Untouchables." What's offered is appropriately rabid but never believable 
scenery-chewing from Ray Sharkey. This Capone -- especially in his last, 
disease-ravaged days, which frame the film's flashbacks -- resembles nothing so 
much as John Belushi's or Chris Elliott's late-night comedy takes on Brando. 
</P>
<P>
"Revenge" is an offer that can be refused. CHRIS WILLMAN

WHO WAS THAT MASKED MAN? ASK THE INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The masked man appears wherever his people are suffering injustices, a crusade 
that has taken him from the run-down tenements of Mexico City to the chambers 
of the Mexican Congress and now, to the streets of Spanish-speaking Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The short and stocky man who calls himself Super Barrio came to California this 
week to see for himself how things are going for his "brothers on this side of 
the border." And on Friday, he learned firsthand about what some of his 
compatriots consider the heavy hand of the immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican folk hero, who dons red tights, a flaming yellow cape and a bright 
red mask to become the "defender of tenants and scourge of greedy landlords," 
was detained by agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service who 
had received anonymous complaints that he was here illegally. The allegations, 
the agency later acknowledged, turned out to be false. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hustled Away 
</P>
<P>
As Super Barrio walked with his entourage near Union Station about 2 p.m., he 
was handcuffed and hustled away by plainclothes INS agents. He was held for 
more than 2 1/2 hours until his attorney, Antonio Rodriguez, met with INS Los 
Angeles District Director Ernest Gustafson and persuaded the official to 
release him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't committing any crime, I just came here to talk and dialogue with 
people," Super Barrio said after his release. "This has opened my eyes to the 
situation lived not only by Mexicans, but by all foreigners in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Before his run-in with authorities Friday, Super Barrio spent a busy week, 
speaking before the Los Angeles City Council on behalf of men who solicit work 
on street corners, meeting farm workers in Oxnard and homeless men who seek 
shelter at a downtown church. He also found time to insult the Mexican consul, 
whom he called an "accomplice" of abuses committed against immigrants at the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Although Super Barrio disappeared soon after his release Friday, a San 
Francisco publicist for his tour angrily said his detention was an act of 
retribution for his pointed criticism of INS policies. 
</P>
<P>
"He came here to talk about abuses on the border, about Mexican and poor 
people's rights and why they don't have those rights," said the publicist, who 
declined to be named. "That's why they detained him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephoned Tips 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson acknowledged that Super Barrio, whose true identity is a carefully 
guarded secret, had the proper papers for his visit -- a visitor's visa that he 
used to enter the United States on Feb. 19. Gustafson said that INS agents had 
taken Super Barrio into custody because of "two or three" tips telephoned into 
the agency over the last week. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some calls regarding his status from various people anonymously," 
Gustafson said, adding: "I wish this guy had his documents on him at the time" 
of his detention. 
</P>
<P>
The masked man appears in Mexico City to aid people suffering injustices -- a 
crusade that has taken him from the Mexican capital's run-down tenements to the 
chambers of the National Congress and now, in his first visit across the 
border, to the streets of Spanish-speaking Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any work in Mexico, so they come over here," Super Barrio said on 
Thursday as he watched a group of Latino men soliciting work on Pico Boulevard. 
"They've practically been driven into economic exile." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing gold lame bikini briefs and with "SB" emblazoned across his chest, 
Super Barrio inevitably drew a few laughs at some of his appearances. The 
portly super hero is taken seriously in Mexico, however, where he has an impact 
on urban politics. 
</P>
<P>
Super Barrio is the symbol of the Assembly of Barrios, a movement of urban 
slum-dwellers that has flourished since the September, 1985, earthquake 
destroyed much of Mexico City's poor, inner-city neighborhoods. Modeled on "El 
Santo," a popular wrestler, Super Barrio's exploits have since become the stuff 
of legend. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prevented Evictions 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, he appears suddenly and unexpectedly when poor tenants are 
about to be evicted from their homes and more than once he has prevented those 
evictions from taking place. He took to the ring to wrestle and defeat a 
mythical "Nuclear-saurus" during protests against a nuclear power plant in 
Veracruz, and he has been invited to attend meetings at Los Pinos, the Mexican 
equivalent of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Unaware of his wide-ranging exploits, some council members smirked and laughed 
out loud when Super Barrio arrived at the chambers of the Los Angeles City 
Council on Wednesday to speak on behalf of immigrant day laborers. 
</P>
<P>
But the costumed super hero strode with dignity down the marble-lined aisles of 
the chamber, his long yellow cape flowing behind him. At the podium, he made a 
short but impassioned speech. 
</P>
<P>
"Work is one of the fundamental rights of life," he told the council, which was 
considering an ordinance that would have made it illegal for the immigrant 
workers to solicit work on street corners. "We are not delinquents, we are 
workers and we want to be treated like human beings." 
</P>
<P>
The council members were impressed enough that they quickly drew up a 
commendation and presented it to the costumed hero after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was amazing," said Marjorie Bray, coordinator of the Deparment of 
Latin American Studies at Cal State Los Angeles, where Super Barrio spoke 
Wednesday. "He had a theoretical grasp of what he was doing, but his language 
was very clear and down-to-earth." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Idea Behind Costume 
</P>
<P>
Before his detention, he gave a relaxed interview in the home of a Westlake 
family, his home during his stay in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the costume, Super Barrio explained, is to capture the 
imagination of Mexico's poor, working people by using the symbols of popular 
culture to deliver a "social message." 
</P>
<P>
"In the ring and in the movies, the wrestlers fight against false enemies -- 
mummies, vampires, ghosts, whatever. I decided to step out of the ring and 
fight against the real enemies, the landlords and the corrupt politicians," he 
said, in costume and masked, as always. 
</P>
<P>
Little is known about the real man behind the mask. He has revealed that he has 
a wife and family, and that he lives, like the people he represents, in a 
dilapidated apartment building in downtown Mexico City. He said he was once 
part of Mexico City's large army of street vendors, hawking trinkets, candy and 
cigarettes to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
Even after his detention Friday, his identity remained a mystery. "I've seen 
several different names," Gustafson said. "And I can't remember any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Super Barrio says his anonymity serves a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"When we are united we are strong," he said. "If we are divided and dispersed 
then I'm not strong, we're not strong. The mask represents the idea that our 
struggle is a collective one, that it doesn't belong to one individual. 
</P>
<P>
"Superman doesn't wear a mask," he continued. "All of his victories belong to 
him, they are his. I try to be the opposite of that." 
</P>
<P>
The masked hero's last day in Southern California started out with an 
appearance at the House of Ruth, an East Los Angeles shelter for homeless 
Latina women, and a second stop at the Mexican Consulate, where a small group 
of people were protesting the results of last year's presidential elections in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing INS Agents 
</P>
<P>
As he and his entourage walked to their car, Super Barrio found himself facing 
the INS agents. It was only his latest hair-raising encounter with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Super Barrio laughed when he recalled an impromptu wrestling match he had with 
the governor of the state of Jalisco. The super hero was delivering a speech 
calling for housing reform and the governor, Super Barrio said, attempted to 
remove his mask. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily, the people came to help me and nothing happened," he said. "There are 
many functionaries who don't understand the symbols of the people. What would 
they win by unmasking me? Super Barrio is everyone."

MOB CHASES MAN DOWN BROADWAY, KILLS HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An angry mob of 15 men wielding sticks and pipes chased a man for two blocks 
before beating and stabbing him to death on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles 
early Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, a 20-year-old transient, apparently became involved in an argument 
with a group of men at Main and 5th streets shortly before 1 a.m., said Police 
Detective John Dunkin, who refused to speculate on the nature of the argument 
or motive for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The mob caught up with the man in front of the Palace Theater, 630 S. Broadway, 
Dunkin said. The man was beaten and stabbed eight or nine times with a 
four-inch knife and died on the northbound lanes of Broadway. His name was 
being withheld pending notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a blade out of a Buck-type folding knife," Dunkin said of the 
murder weapon found bent at the scene. "It's the weapon of preference, of 
choice in this type of attack." 
</P>
<P>
Dunkin said the victim had apparently been robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the early morning attack flagged down a police patrol car and 
officers arrested four men as they were running from the scene minutes after 
the stabbing, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects are James Turner and Adrian Norris, both 19; Robert Riley, 18, and 
Gerald Jackson, 25. All were arrested on suspicion of murder and were being 
held Friday at Parker Center without bail, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Though police would not speculate on a motive for the killing, Dunkin did say 
that the area is the site of frequent sales of crack cocaine and that an almost 
identical mob killing occurred at nearby 6th and Spring streets last month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Drug Deal Gone Bad' 
</P>
<P>
"In that case, it was definitely a drug deal gone bad," Dunkin said of the 
killing of Fred Matthews, 38. Five suspects were arrested in Matthews' killing, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the businesses on Broadway's busy shopping strip were closed at 
the time of the killing. During the day, the site of the attack is a busy bus 
stop. Most merchants and passers-by said they had not heard about the killing. 
</P>
<P>
"The last movie here ends at 10:30 (p.m.)," said Maria, an usher at the Palace 
Theater who asked that her last name not be used. "People don't come to the 
late movies because it's dangerous at night. There's nothing but winos out on 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bartsouleas, manager of a video arcade next to the theater, said he 
closed his business at 8:30 p.m. He said he found yellow police tape on the 
street when he opened his store Friday morning. 
</P>

"If there were that many people, it must have been a gang," Bartsouleas said. 
"I don't think it was regulars" in the neighborhood.

<P>
'Become Safer and Safer' 
</P>
<P>
Dunkin said the mob killings occurred during a period when homicides in the 
downtown Skid Row area have declined. "It's become safer and safer all the 
time," he said. "There's less killings. They seem to be more focused and less 
random." 
</P>
<P>
But Mike Neely, director of the Homeless Outreach Project on 5th Street, said 
Friday's killing is similar to the drug-related assaults that have become an 
everyday occurrence on Broadway and other downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy tries to get the drugs for free and a group of people chases him down 
the street and beats the hell out of him. That's the way these things happen," 
Neely said. "I've seen it happen before. I've seen guys beaten with baseball 
bats. I've seen it on Broadway quite often."

2 INDUSTRY SMOG PLANS WON'T WORK, AQMD SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Regional air quality officials, stepping up their drive for quick approval of 
their own clean air plan, disclosed Friday that a new analysis shows that the 
South Coast Air Basin would never meet federal clean air standards under two 
controversial alternatives proposed by industry. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the South Coast Air Quality Management District said that claims 
by Southern California Edison Co. and the Western States Petroleum Assn. that 
their less-costly alternatives would bring the nation's smoggiest urban area 
into compliance with the federal ozone standard are based on questionable 
assumptions and in many cases are undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Would Not Work 
</P>
<P>
"They would never meet the standards," AQMD Executive Officer James M. Lents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We went line by line, assumption for assumption, measure by measure . . . and 
found a number of points where the facts simply did not support the conclusions 
they reached," said Pat Nemeth, AQMD deputy executive officer for planning and 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that the district had publicly stated that the Edison and 
Western States Petroleum plans would fail to meet the federal ozone standard, 
which is 0.12 parts per million. The district has previously said that the 
indus try plans would fail to meet federal standards for nitrogen dioxide, 
carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter. 
</P>
<P>
The district's analysis was quickly disputed by both Edison and Western States 
Petroleum. They repeated earlier arguments that their proposals would not only 
clean up the air basin 10 years sooner than the AQMD but at far less cost. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's analysis, released at a press conference at district headquarters in 
El Monte, comes just three weeks before a scheduled showdown vote March 17 on a 
far-reaching clean air plan to bring Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties into compliance with federal clean air standards by the year 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's proposal is roundly opposed by business and industry as too costly. 
Business interests have warned that the plan would cost tens of thousands of 
lost jobs, a charge denied Friday by the district. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's plan was originally scheduled for a vote last December. But the vote 
was delayed after legal problems with the plan's environmental impact report 
were discovered. Since then, the district has reviewed its plan, as well as 
those offered by industry. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear Friday that the AQMD staff had not retreated, and Lents said he is 
now convinced that there are enough votes on the board to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the case is strengthened, not weakened," Lents said. "We are calling 
for action now." 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD said Friday that its plan would cost $2.79 billion a year, compared to 
$1.59 billion annually under the Edison plan and $1.63 billion under the 
Western States Petroleum plan. The costs are for air pollution control measures 
proposed only in the first five years under what the district calls Tier I of 
its control measures. The costs do not include between $37 billion and $40 
billion in new freeways and mass transit systems that would largely be built 
even without an air quality plan but are nonetheless a factor in meeting clean 
air standards. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials said the industry contention that their plans would meet the 
ozone standard were based on the incorrect assumption that each air pollution 
control measure they endorsed would result in greater emission reductions than 
the district thought likely. 
</P>
<P>
District officials also said a new analysis of recent data disproves Edison's 
claim that the federal standard for microscopic particulate matter, known as 
PM10, could be met with fewer controls. Neither industry plan would meet the 
standard for oxides of nitrogen, one of the key ingredients of photochemical 
smog, the district argued. 
</P>
<P>
Fine particulate matter is largely responsible for poor visibility and appears 
as the brown haze often seen in the basin. Particulate matter can also bypass 
the human body's defenses and lodge deeply in lungs and cause respiratory 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, which accounts for about 95% of photochemical smog, has been shown to 
reduce lung capacity, causes coughing, burning of the eyes, impedes the body's 
immune system, results in reduced lung capacity and damages trees, crops, and 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's conclusion that the Edison plan failed to meet the ozone standard 
"is not based on Edison's latest submittal to the district in January, 1989," 
Edison said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said its PM10 proposal "is consistent with U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency guidelines." Both Edison responses, offered by Nader Mansour, 
the firm's environmental regulations manager, were disputed by Nemeth. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wang, manager of operating and environmental issues for Western States 
Petroleum, said, "I don't feel that their analysis is reflective of our plan. I 
don't know how they're running the model . . . but we have double- and 
triple-checked our runs."

HOUSING BOARD MOVES TO CLAMP TIGHTER RULES ON AGENCY'S CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The Los Angeles City Housing Authority Board of Commissioners appointed a 
special committee on Friday to tighten contracting regulations and to ensure 
that the procedures are followed by Executive Director Leila Gonzalez-Correa. 
</P>
<P>
The action came in response to a report Friday in The Times that 
Gonzalez-Correa had violated federal procurement regulations on at least six 
occasions while awarding Housing Authority contracts to her acquaintances and 
to political supporters of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission should play a much more active role in this," said Dori Pye, 
who along with the other board members had been unaware of the contracting 
irregularities. Pye added in an interview, "The rules have to be heeded. From 
here on in they will be heeded. I can assure you, as a commissioner, of that." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa was expected to report on the contracting violations Friday at 
the request of Bradley, but was unable to attend the board meeting because she 
was ill, her aides said. A Bradley spokesman said the mayor was not satisfied 
with a memo explaining the violations that was submitted by Gonzalez-Correa. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the six violations of federal contracting procedures, The Times 
also has learned that Gonzalez-Correa was told by city officials that she 
should have solicited formal competitive bids in awarding other contracts, but 
she ignored the warnings. 
</P>
<P>
In one case involving the refinancing of the Owensmouth Gardens apartment 
complex, Gonzalez-Correa was advised by the city attorney's office in November, 
1987, and later by the chief administrative officer of procurement rules that 
required her to seek other financial firms capable of handling the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Gonzalez-Correa continued to deal exclusively with a group of 
financial consultants and lawyers that she had invited to put together the 
multimillion-dollar refinancing package, records show. The financial team, 
which received about $500,000 in commissions and fees, included Donald Carter, 
president of Benton Mortgage Co. of Tennessee and a friend of Gonzalez-Correa, 
and two Bradley allies -- former City Councilman David Cunningham and former 
Congresswoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Could Be Challenged' 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa, with the help of Deputy Mayor Grace Davis, persuaded 
commissioners to approve the Benton proposal, despite concerns expressed to her 
at the time by the city attorney's office that she had failed to invite other 
companies to participate. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be challenged by other (companies) that feel they might have been 
able to do as good or better a job," said Deputy City Atty. Dov Lesel, 
according to transcripts. Lesel said Gonzalez-Correa avoided an outright 
violation of federal contracting regulations by stating in reports that she had 
made informal contacts by telephone with other firms. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Correa also acknowledged in recent interviews that the Housing 
Authority's contracting practices are in need of reform because of sloppy 
accounting procedures. In several cases, Gonzalez-Correa has issued purchase 
orders to her acquaintances and to Bradley supporters without requiring any 
accounting of the services provided, records show. 
</P>
<P>
In once case, Washington attorney Jane Lang received $24,666 in legal fees 
after submitting monthly billing statements without the customary documentation 
of services, invoices show. Lang is a former general counsel of the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development who met Gonzalez-Correa several 
years ago as a fellow housing lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to institute a more careful processing of bills and all that," 
Gonzalez-Correa said in the interview. "I am going to ask Jane to send us an 
absolute printout of everything she's done for the Housing Authority. Hour by 
hour. She'll do it. I will take immediate steps to correct it." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the city attorney's office advised Gonzalez-Correa to begin using 
standard employment contracts -- instead of blanket purchase orders -- to spell 
out specific consulting and other services purchased by the Housing Authority. 
This recommendation is among several to be considered by the special committee 
of three commissioners established Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley must shoulder much of the blame for the Housing Authority's current 
contracting troubles because they are strikingly similar to those that occurred 
under Homer Smith, Gonzalez-Correa's successor, said City Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor took so much flak when Homer was there and they were good friends 
and all. . . ," Flores said. "You would think that (Bradley) would say, 'I'm 
going to make sure that this never happens again. I'm going to assure that 
there are checks and balances and I'm going to instruct my commissioners.' " 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she advised the Board of Commissioners several months ago to hire a 
full-time analyst to keep track of spending activities by Gonzalez-Correa and 
her staff. The board on Friday postponed a motion to recruit an analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Several board members on Friday expressed surprise that Gonzalez-Correa had 
issued contracts exceeding $10,000 without soliciting competitive bids or 
seeking board approval as required by federal regulations and the Housing 
Authority's own purchasing policy. 
</P>
<P>
In her report on contracting practices submitted to Bradley and the board on 
Friday, Gonzalez-Correa did not report three of the six procurement violations 
that are documented in Housing Authority records. These involved a $44,979 
training contract to Carlos Garcia, a former colleague of Gonzalez-Correa; a 
$35,000 contract for legal services to attorney Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a key 
Bradley ally; and a $9,500 contract to the accounting firm of Deloitte Haskins 
Sells, a Bradley contributor. All three contracts were issued by 
Gonzalez-Correa without competitive bids. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Lang, Gonzalez-Correa reported Friday that the Housing Authority 
is preparing to invite other attorneys to vie for the legal services that Lang 
currently provides. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the federal 
agency that funds the Housing Authority, offered no reaction on Friday to the 
contracting violations. HUD officials in Los Angeles were unaware of any 
irregularities in the hiring of consultants or other contractors, in part 
because the federal agency has not conducted a comprehensive audit of Housing 
Authority books in five years, said HUD spokesman Reagan Reed. The Housing 
Authority has been designated "operationally troubled" by HUD since May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
HUD officials "will most likely tell the Housing Authority to get its act 
together" in the wake of the contracting violations, said Lesel, the deputy 
city attorney who serves as the housing agency's legal counsel.

RENT CONTROL WINS ROUND IN U.S. COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major victory for Santa Monica, a federal judge Friday granted the city's 
motion for summary judgment and ruled against a 93-year-old landlady 
challenging the city's strict rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords had hoped to use the case to overturn Santa Monica's rent controls on 
constitutional grounds. But U.S. District Judge Ronald S. W. Lew in a 14-page 
ruling said the law could not be found unconstitutional because there was no 
evidence that it deprived owners of the use and control of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the landlady, Lena Schnuck, complained that the rent law 
prevented her from evicting a tenant and had sought a jury trial. Attorney 
Robert Jagiello said he planned to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"Our audience is not a trial judge in Los Angeles," he said. "It's the Supreme 
Court in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Monica Deputy City Atty. Barry Rosenbaum said the ruling "should send 
a clear signal to any landlord organization that if they want to change rent 
control laws, this (the courts) is not the avenue."

FIRE, SMOKE BLAMED ON POWER FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A power failure Friday morning at the Fletcher Oil refinery in Carson produced 
large flames and a billowing cloud of black smoke that was visible for miles. 
</P>
<P>
Company Vice President Richard D. Erdman said the power outage knocked out 
controls on a refinery unit and excess gases were burned off through a flare, 
sending flames soaring 80 to 90 feet into the air. "It was rather spectacular 
because it went straight up," Erdman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-minute outage was caused by a battery failure in "a very critical piece 
of equipment" designed to supply uninterrupted power, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A South Coast Air Quality Management District spokesman said the refinery will 
not be cited for violating air pollution laws because the smoke was the result 
of "a legitimate breakdown."

BUILDING BAN VOTED NEAR STADIUM SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irwindale City Council has put a moratorium on building permits in the area 
south of Live Oak Avenue and west of the San Gabriel River Freeway where city 
officials contemplate locating the proposed Los Angeles Raiders football 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Charles Martin said the moratorium, which is for 45 days but could 
be extended after a public hearing, was needed to prevent anyone from trying to 
drive up the value of several properties while their use is considered for the 
stadium, and the council quickly adopted it unanimously at its Thursday night 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also said he and other Irwindale representatives will meet with Raiders 
team owner Al Davis in the coming week to seek his approval for making the Live 
Oak site the preferred choice for the stadium instead of the gravel pit west of 
the Irwindale Avenue exit on the north side of the Foothill Freeway.

SOUTHERN BAPTISTS PLANNING DOOR-TO-DOOR DRIVE IN VEGAS

Southern Baptists plan a door-to-door evangelism campaign this summer when they 
hold their convention in Las Vegas -- the city of slot machines and legalized 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,160 lay people and pastors from several states already have signed 
up to knock on doors before the denomination's annual meeting in the Nevada 
city June 13-15. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an organized witnessing effort to share Christ with every home in the 
city," said Larry J. Lewis, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Home 
Mission Board. 
</P>
<P>
The Home Mission Board also has distributed pages of the Las Vegas telephone 
directory to more than 6,000 "prayer volunteers," who have pledged to pray for 
residents of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers will get pep talks from television minister Jerry Falwell and 
Los Angeles Baptist Pastor E.V. Hill -- neither of whom are Southern Baptists 
-- and Arthur Blessitt, a Hollywood evangelist who has dragged a cross through 
much of the world, and Florida evangelist Rick Stanley, stepbrother of the late 
Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
They will distribute about 10,000 New Testaments and 10,000 gospel tracts in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce President Mark Smith, a 30-year resident of the 
gambling capital, said he has "never heard of anything like this happening in 
Las Vegas before. But it may be better received than a lot of people might 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous revivals are set for eight Las Vegas area churches during the week 
before the annual meeting, which is expected to attract about 20,000 Southern 
Baptists.

VICTIM'S KIN ASSAIL DEAL ON SHORTER TERM FOR RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The family of a USC rape victim blasted the Los Angeles district attorney's 
office Friday for negotiating what they called an "outrageous" plea bargain 
with the admitted rapist. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement forced Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ernest M. Hiroshige to 
choose a prison term of 16 to 22 years for Maurice J. Cornett. The judge 
sentenced Cornett to 20 years. Los Angeles Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Sitkoff 
said Cornett would have faced up to a 56-year prison term for the rape had he 
gone to trial and been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the plea bargain was a result of Cornett's full cooperation -- 
at considerable risk to his own safety -- as a key witness in two gang-related 
murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
Before the sentencing, the rape victim, who turned 23 on Thursday and returned 
to Los Angeles from Maine for Friday's proceeding, asked to address the court 
outside Cornett's presence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refused to Leave 
</P>
<P>
But Cornett, 19, refused to leave the courtroom. Hiroshige then invited the 
woman -- the granddaughter of a former USC law dean -- up to the bench for a 
private conference. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom afterward, the woman said she simply wanted to impress 
upon the judge "how it put a lot of fear into my life." She said she did not 
want Cornett to gain any satisfaction from hearing about her lingering 
emotional trauma. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by her parents, the woman said afterward that she hopes Cornett 
will "experience some of the same fears in prison" that she has endured in the 
last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, now married, was raped by Cornett at knifepoint in her Troy Hall 
dormitory on the night of Aug. 8, 1986. Cornett had been living in the dorm 
illegally for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Over a two-day period, he burglarized five rooms, in addition to committing the 
rape. He was caught by security guards while trying to drive away in the 
woman's car, which had a stick shift. He did not know how to drive such a 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
In another unusual development, a former prosecutor in the murder cases and now 
a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge, David Milton, was called to testify on 
Cornett's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Milton explained that the plea bargain was reached because of Cornett's 
cooperation as an "indispensable" witness in the two murder cases. Milton 
called the plea bargain agreement fair. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshige also barred a news photographer from taking pictures of Cornett, 
saying there is ample evidence that he faces possible retaliation for his 
cooperation with prosecutors in the murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
Sitkoff said he too would have preferred to prosecute Cornett but added that it 
is paramount that the murderers be brought to justice. Cornett was the sole 
eyewitness to one of the shootings in which a mother and her 14-year-old son 
were gunned down in their home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suspect Convicted 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshige had presided over the trial of one of those cases, in which the 
killer was convicted and sent to state prison for life without the possibility 
of parole. The second case is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the rape victim's uncle addressed the court, speaking on behalf of 
her family. The woman's parents also were in the courtroom, as was a woman who 
later identified herself as Cornett's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
The uncle, David Evans, a Los Angeles attorney, said his family considered the 
plea bargain "an outrageous deal." He called Cornett "a racist, Nazi thug." 
Evans said Cornett, who is black, had confessed to police that he had wanted to 
"do a white girl." 
</P>
<P>
Evans asked Hiroshige to impose the maximum 22 years "to make a gesture that 
will help ease our pain." 
</P>
<P>
The judge said he was "very touched" by the plight of the Evans family. But he 
said it was "unfortunate" that he now was put "in the middle" of the Cornett 
plea-bargain controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Hiroshige said, "The D.A.s are supposed to know . . . the value of 
a case," adding, "When a prosecutor gives me a range (of sentences), I have to 
consider it." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his age, Cornett will probably serve most of his term in the 
California Youth Authority but will go on to state prison after he turns 25, 
Sitkoff said. He could be eligible for parole in about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Evans family reached a $275,000 out-of-court settlement in a 
civil suit against USC. 
</P>
<P>
The rape victim was an honors student in accounting and, at graduation, was 
recruited by every one of the country's Big Eight accounting firms, Evans said. 
But because of her lingering trauma, the woman has chosen to live in a small 
town in Maine.

WITH MAGIC BACK, LAKERS CELEBRATE; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS' 115-103 LOSS IS THEIR 37TH STRAIGHT AT THE FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Even though the Dr. in front of his name signifies a doctorate in chemistry and 
not an expertise in orthopedic medicine, it was Laker owner Jerry Buss who gave 
clearance Friday night for Magic Johnson to return to the lineup after he had 
missed five games due to a partially torn left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
But it did not take Buss, who had the final say on Johnson's return simply 
because he signs the paychecks, to determine that Johnson is once again 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers might not have really needed Johnson to beat the Sacramento Kings, 
115-103, before 17,505 fans at the Forum, but they certainly thought it was 
nice to see him on the floor again. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Reynolds, the coach of the Kings (14-38), said he approached Johnson 
before tipoff and told him to take another night off. But Johnson apparently 
listens to Buss more than Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just our luck Magic played tonight, although we knew he would," 
Reynolds said. "I told him he shouldn't play, but he did anyway. He should. 
He's the best player in the world. He reminded me of myself in my prime, the 
spring of '47." 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott, seemingly hitting his prime, probably could have subdued 
Sacramento on his own. Scott, who had 33 points Monday night in Sacramento, 
scored 31 points Friday night. It was the first time in nearly a month that the 
Lakers had Scott and Johnson together for a full game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson played 23 minutes in his return, scoring eight points and passing for 
eight assists. More important, from a Laker standpoint, was how Johnson felt 
after playing for the first time since Feb. 8, when he was injured while 
scoring a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," he said. "It's going to take a game or so to get back 
your timing and senses, but it was all right tonight. It was good to get this 
game under my belt and know I'm back." 
</P>
<P>
The plan, according to Laker Coach Pat Riley, was to play Johnson sparingly in 
the hope of having him close to full strength for Sunday night's showdown 
against the Phoenix Suns, who remained 1 1/2 games behind the Lakers with a 
victory over Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good time for him to come back, with our most important game of the 
season coming up," Riley said. "He looked sharp, strong and confident. He 
played 17 minutes in the first half and, to me, he didn't show any effects (of 
the injury), except maybe being physically (tired)." 
</P>
<P>
This was not vintage Johnson, but that also was the plan. Johnson said he 
consciously curbed his usually aggressive game in order to ease the strain on 
his hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"I had already set it in my mind to ease back into it, rather than just come 
back the way I was," Johnson said. "I just wanted to come back, not go wild and 
crazy. I had to tell myself to stay under control." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, according to Scott, seemed more in sync with teammates during the 
Lakers' half-court game, as opposed to the fastbreak, which was to be expected. 
Still, Johnson demonstrated in the first half that he can cut and drive to the 
basket without hindrance. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half, (the hamstring) was great," Johnson said. "In the second 
half, I got a little tired. I felt it more then." 
</P>
<P>
All told, Johnson missed 15 days with the hamstring tear, which Laker trainer 
Gary Vitti termed "moderate to serious" at the time of the injury. But by 
working out twice daily, at the Forum during the day and at a private health 
club at night, Johnson reduced the length of his absence. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he felt ready to play after Friday morning's practice, but he 
called Buss to get permission. 
</P>
<P>
"It's his team, so he makes the decisions," Johnson said. "If he would have 
said no, then I wouldn't have played." 
</P>
<P>
And the Lakers probably would have won, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Scott made 13 of 22 shots, including four three-pointers. It was a vast 
improvement over his 5-for-20 shooting performance in Wednesday night's loss at 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green contributed 13 points and 15 rebounds, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and 
Michael Cooper 13 points each and Mychal Thompson 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, such as they are after a week of trade upheaval, were led by guard 
Kenny Smith, who had 30 points. Jim Petersen, now the starting center at 6 feet 
10 inches, fouled out with 14 point and 8 rebounds as the Kings were saddled 
with their sixth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
Those really were the Kings at the Forum Friday night. You could tell just by 
the fact that they lost to the Lakers in Inglewood for the 37th straight time 
since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
In some respects, however, this was a vastly different Sacramento team, and the 
change was not necessarily for the better. After a flurry of trade activity 
this week, the Kings are left with only five players who were on the roster at 
the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman Tisdale, acquired from Indiana Monday, was in the lineup Friday, but 
newly acquired Danny Ainge and Brad Lohaus had yet to make the trip from 
Boston. That left the Kings with only nine players to take on a Laker team that 
had added Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between the teams became evident almost immediately. After the 
Lakers needed late free throws by David Rivers to beat the Kings by three 
points in Sacramento Monday night, Los Angeles dominated from the outset Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
They built a quick 13-6 lead in the first three minutes and extended the 
advantage to 30-14 with 3:20 remaining. At that point, Riley brought in Rivers 
to replace Johnson, who had assumed his usual playmaking role from the opening 
tip. 
</P>
<P>
The first sign that Johnson was back and not ailing came 40 seconds into the 
game, when he drove through heavy traffic in the lane and drew a foul. 
</P>
<P>
About a minute later, Johnson posted low on Kenny Smith and sank a hook shot 
for his first field goal since being injured in that game against the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson would only score one other basket in the first half, but the Lakers 
were not in need of his scoring. They had a 32-21 lead heading into the second 
quarter, before the Kings made a brief run, cutting the Laker advantage to 
44-39 with 6:21 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But after a timeout, the Lakers regained command. Abdul-Jabbar began the run by 
sinking a sky hook. Two missed King shots were converted into a Worthy inside 
move and a Scott jump shot, returning the Laker lead to double figures. It 
remained that way for the remainder of the half, the Lakers taking a 64-49 lead 
into the locker room and a 16-point advantage into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, coming back from a partially torn left hamstring, said before 
Friday night's game that his lateral movement had improved to the point where 
he could play without fear of reinjury. But he said he wants to return 
gradually to maximum capacity. "I feel good," Johnson said. "I know it's going 
to be a longtime thing. I don't want to try to do too much. But it's good to be 
back." . . . Danny Ainge, acquired along with Brad Lohaus Thursday for Joe 
Kleine and Ed Pinckney, is not expected to join the Kings until Monday night's 
game against Seattle. Thursday, Ainge told the Hartford Courant: "I always 
thought I'd be here (in Boston) the rest of my career, until this season. But 
with the team struggling, something had to happen. When it finally did happen, 
I wasn't prepared for it." . . . Pinckney told the Courant that he was just 
happy not to be traded to the Clippers. A deal involving Kleine and Pinckney 
for Benoit Benjamin had been discussed, without success.

For a team that seemed to have all the answers, UC Irvine staggered out of 
Thursday night's loss to Cal State Long Beach with a lot of questions. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (11-13, 8-7 in the Big West) had just one day to regroup. They 
will play New Mexico State (17-8, 10-5) at 5 p.m. today at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State dominated Irvine in the teams' first meeting, 90-69. The 
Aggies' front line of Johnny Roberson, Willie Joseph and center James Anderson 
made a combined 23 of 37 shots and scored 54 points in that game. JOHN WEYLER

Al Lewis scored 20 points, including two on foul shots with 13 seconds left in 
overtime, to lead 19th-ranked St. Mary's over Gonzaga, 67-63, at Spokane, 
Wash., and give the Gaels the West Coast Athletic Conference regular-season 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary's, which this week moved into the top 20 for the first time in school 
history, improved to 23-3 overall and 11-2 in the conference. The victory, 
coupled with Pepperdine's loss to USF, assured that the Gaels will be seeded 
No. 1 for the WCAC tournament March 4-6 in USF Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzaga erased a nine-point deficit in the last 2:30 of regulation and tied the 
score, 57-57, with 31 seconds left on a three-point shot by Jim McPhee. He led 
the Bulldogs (13-13, 4-9) with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
James Dailey's basket and two free throws by Robert Haugen put St. Mary's 
ahead, 61-57, in the first minute of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee made five straight free throws in the extra period before missing the 
back end of a one-and-one with 1:50 left that would have tied the score at 
63-63. 
</P>
<P>
Haugen scored on St. Mary's next possession, and Lewis' free throws sealed the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
U. San Diego 53, Portland 31 -- Danny Means scored 12 points to pace the 
Toreros (7-18, 2-11) to the win at Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, which shot just 22% from the floor, is 2-24 and 2-11.

RAVELING PLANS TO START SENIORS IN HOME FINALE

<TEXT>
<P>
USC Coach George Raveling plans to start seniors Chris Moore, Rich Grande and 
Andy Olivarez in the Trojans' final home game of the season today at 3 p.m. 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Pollard, senior forward, probably won't play because he has a hip pointer. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 9-18 overall and 2-13 in the Pacific 10 Conference. Washington is 10-15 
and 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have lost five of their last six games, most recently to UCLA 
Thursday night, 101-78. 
</P>
<P>
"Washington is a strange team," Raveling said. "They're a lot like us. They've 
had some moments when they looked like they could be one of the best teams in 
the conference and they've had some games (in which) you're puzzled as to what 
the heck's going on with them." CHRIS BAKER

<P>
Second-seeded Boris Becker rallied from a first-set loss to overpower Christo 
van Rensburg, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, Friday night in the $602,500 U.S. Pro Indoor 
Tennis Championships at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, top-seeded Andre Agassi defeated Dan Goldie, 6-1, 6-4, advancing to a 
semifinal match today against third-seeded Tim Mayotte, who defeated Brad 
Gilbert, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Becker will meet No. 4-seeded Mikael Pernfors of Sweden, who defeated Robert 
Seguso, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Becker had eight double-faults, including three in the fourth game of the first 
set and two in the second game of the third set, both times losing his service. 
"Sometimes my concentration goes a little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldie, seeded eighth, made a stand in the second set against Agassi after 
trailing 1-3. Both players used a two-handed backhand as they dueled from the 
baseline, and Goldie closed the gap to 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the 14-point final game, Agassi lost five match points, then Goldie 
backhanded a volley wide to set up the sixth. Then Goldie hit a return into the 
net to end it. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in 10 days, John McEnroe had little trouble beating Carl 
Uwe Steeb of West Germany, this time advancing to the semifinals of the 
$291,000 Grand Prix tournament at Lyon, France, with a 6-2, 6-2 win. 
</P>
<P>
Last week McEnroe beat the West German, ranked 92nd in the world, handily in 
the first round of the Milan tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"After I took the game at 1-1, I feel the tide just turned. I was feeling very 
comfortable," McEnroe said. "Everything just felt right. That's what I hope to 
have in the next two days." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe, seeded second, will next play Jonas Svensson, who defeated fellow 
Swede Magnus Gustafsson, 6-2, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Navratilova defeated Jenny Byrne of Australia, 6-1, 6-3, to 
reach the semifinals of the $250,000 Virginia Slims of California at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova will face Larisa Savchenko of the Soviet Union, who defeated Patty 
Fendick, 6-1, 6-1. Another Soviet player, second-seeded Natalia Zvereva, 
advanced and will meet Zina Garrison.

Denny Stolz, fired as San Diego State football coach in November, will remain 
at the school as the men's golf coach, the school said in a news release. Stolz 
won the school's only Western Athletic Conference football title in 1986, his 
first as Aztec coach. But his next two Aztec teams finished 5-7 and 3-8, and he 
was fired with one game remaining in the 1988 season.

BRIAN HEAD, UTAH'S BEST-KEPT SECRET, IS CLOSE AS LAKE TAHOE

BRIAN HEAD, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away on a shelf at 9,600 feet in the southern Wasatch Mountains, this 
place is perhaps the best-kept secret in western skiing. 
</P>
<P>
It's not Snowbird or Park City, the state's two world-class resorts, but then 
it's not 750 miles from Los Angeles, either. It's about 475, all except the 
last 16 via four-lane Interstate 15. That's the same mileage Southland skiers 
must drive to reach Lake Tahoe, a trip with several stretches of two-lane 
passing roulette, plus four snowy summits. 
</P>
<P>
"Skiers arrive here on a weekend from Southern California or Las Vegas and say, 
'Wow, there's nobody around,' " marketing director Julie Amsden said. "Then 
they try to keep it to themselves because they don't want the crowds to come 
and spoil everything." 
</P>
<P>
Still relatively unspoiled are 500 acres of ski terrain on two mountains with a 
top elevation of 11,000 feet, served by seven chairlifts and covered by Utah's 
famous powder. About 45% of the runs are intermediate, 35% advanced and 20% 
beginner. Cross-country skiers can choose from a number of trails, including 
the scenic route to Cedar Breaks National Monument and back. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, Brian Head is an especially attractive destination for a ski 
week because of the opportunity to add a little sightseeing in nearby Zion and 
Bryce Canyon national parks. Then there's always Las Vegas to break -- in more 
ways than one -- the monotony of the eight-hour drive across the desert and 
mountains, either coming or going. 
</P>
<P>
But skiing has been the principal attraction here since the Navajo lift was 
opened in January 1965. The Giant Steps Lodge across the road, with four lifts, 
came later, and Brian Head Station, with two more lifts around the bend, is the 
most recent addition. A free shuttle-bus service connects the three base areas. 
</P>
<P>
On a sunny Sunday recently, there were only about 2,000 skiers scattered over 
the slopes and inside the lodges. Lift lines were non-existent. At $22, the 
all-day ticket is priced reasonably; Snowbird and Park City charge $32 tops, 
but of course, they're both bigger than Brian Head. 
</P>
<P>
Base depths currently range between four and five feet, following a slightly 
later-than-usual start this winter. Although the big resorts near Salt Lake 
City were open by Thanksgiving, Brian Head remained just south of the jet 
stream and didn't get enough snow to start operating until the Tuesday before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd had two good years in a row before that, so it was a bit deflating to 
have to sit around while others were skiing," Amsden said. 
</P>
<P>
Also somewhat deflating has been the current status of Brian Head Enterprises, 
which is undergoing Chaper 11 reorganization, according to Amsden. 
</P>
<P>
"It has caused some problems," she said. "But skiers aren't being affected, and 
we're fortunate to have a trustee who understands the ski business. Rene Meyer, 
the boss now, has been an executive at both Sun Valley (Ida.) and Snowbird." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight accommodations are separate from the ski operation, and there is a 
mix of hotels and condominium units supplying beds for about 4,000 skiers in 
the town of Brian Head. Additional lodging is available in Parowan, at the 
junction of Interstate 15 and Utah 143, and in Cedar City, 32 miles away. Cedar 
City also has an airport that is projected as a future gateway for commuter 
airline connections with Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Apres-ski activity is limited mainly to a few restaurants, including a new 
gourmet spot called The Junction in Brian Head Station. Utah's liquor laws are 
somewhat obscure to most visitors, but the bottom line seems to be that it's OK 
to drink with a meal, or if you go through the fiction of paying nominal dues 
to join a "club." 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah is known upstate as Dixie, also as "Color Country." It's usually 
10 to 30 degrees warmer down here, but old Brian Head hands are hoping, 
probably in vain, that it doesn't become a skiing hot spot. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
A 30-member panel selected Marc Hodler, longtime president of the International 
Ski Federation (FIS), as the seventh winner of the AT&amp;T Skiing Award, given 
annually to an individual "whose commitment to excellence and dedication to 
skiing has profoundly enriched the sport." The other finalists were Jean-Claude 
Killy, France's 1968 triple Olympic gold medalist, and Andrea Mead Lawrence, 
1952 double Olympic gold medalist, who lives in Mammoth Lakes. Previous winners 
included Bob Beattie, Jimmy Heuga, Serge Lang, Billy Kidd, Warren Miller and 
the late Willy Schaeffler. 
</P>
<P>
World Cup racing continues this weekend at Steamboat, Colo., where the women 
are competing in another downhill and a super-G, and at Whistler Mountain, 
Canada, where the men are doing likewise. . . . Vreni Schneider of Switzerland 
tops the women's standings with 286 points, 62 more than teammates Maria 
Walliser and Michela Figini, both two-time World Cup overall winners, who are 
tied for second place. Carole Merle of France, who had been Schneider's closest 
pursuer, injured her right knee last week in a training run at Lake Louise, 
Canada, and was sent home for arthroscopic surgery, her season over. . . . Marc 
Girardelli of Luxembourg has all but clinched his third men's overall title 
with 358 points, 116 more than three-time champion Pirmin Zurbriggen of 
Switzerland. . . . The circuit winds up with two slaloms and two giant slaloms 
for both men and women early next month at Furano and Shigakogen, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing on TV this weekend: World Cup women's downhill today at noon, then World 
Cup women's super-G Sunday at 3 p.m., both on Channel 7. . . . "Ski World" 
Sunday at 2:30 p.m., followed by World Cup men's downhill at 3, both on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
The World Nordic Ski Championships continue through Sunday at Lahti, Finland. 
The host Finns lead the medal count with 13, including six golds; Norway is 
next with eight (two of them golds), followed by the Soviet Union and Sweden 
with five each (including two golds apiece). Nancy Fiddler of Crowley Lake 
scored the first Nordic World Cup point for the United States in four years 
when she finished 15th in the women's 15-kilometer classic race last Tuesday. . 
. . The World Freestyle Ski Championships will begin next Tuesday and run 
through March 5 at Oberjoch, West Germany.

Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., is in second place on the U.S. Pro Tour, 15 points

Doug Pfeiffer, "father of freestyle skiing" and former editor of Skiing 
magazine, is again teaching his Pfeiffer's Pfun Class at Snow Summit, and he 
says, "Anybody capable of making half-fast christies is invited to enroll" and 
learn some new tricks. . . . Buzz Bainbridge, a longtime New Mexico ski 
executive in various capacities, was the guest of honor Friday night in Santa 
Fe, N.M., during the weekend-long WinterFestival, celebrating 50 years of 
skiing there. . . . More than 35,000 beginners turned out at 260 ski areas 
around the country on "National Learn-to-Ski Day" last month, according to the 
sponsoring National Ski Areas Assn. and Ski Industries America. . . . 
"Free-Heel Skiing," a recently published book by Paul Parker, tells 
cross-country skiers all they need to know about telemark turns and how to 
apply Alpine parallel techniques so they can ski anywhere, in all conditions.

DAVIS DOESN'T MIND BEING LEFT OUT IN LEFT

Chili Davis doesn't get defensive when asked about his new residence in left 
field. Some might say he wasn't too defensive in right field, either, but 
that's too easy a line; this is a new year, and those 19 outfield errors in 
1988 were really no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Left field?" Davis said. "I don't mind. Whatever helps us win. Actually, I 
thought they'd put me at first base -- just in case Wally didn't sign." 
</P>
<P>
Such a precaution won't be necessary. First baseman Wally Joyner signed his 
1989 contract with the Angels earlier this month, two days after Davis had 
signed a three-year deal worth more than $4 million. And that was a month after 
the Angels had signed Claudell Washington to a three-year contract, the move 
that set Davis' shift to left in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, a good defensive player, will replace Davis in right field, where a 
club-record 19 errors went skipping off and around Davis' glove last season. 
Davis is to be stationed in left, where Manager Doug Rader hopes the change in 
scenery will do him good. 
</P>
<P>
"Chili had some defensive shortcomings in right, especially early last year," 
Rader said. "It might be to his benefit to put him in (left field) and not 
bring back any old memories." 
</P>
<P>
Davis didn't play much left field during his six seasons with the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"Just in spurts," he said. "Usually when Roger (Craig, Giant manager) came up 
with one of his ingenious ideas. He'd want to keep a pitcher in a game (after 
making a pitching change), so he'd move the pitcher to right field and me to 
left." 
</P>
<P>
There's more permanence surrounding this move. Barring an injury to Washington 
or center fielder Devon White -- or designated hitter Brian Downing -- Davis 
figures to be left in left. 
</P>
<P>
He promises no Gold Glove, but expects to hold on to more baseballs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I was a little tentative," he said. "I had surgery the year before 
and they put a pin in my shoulder. When I first signed here, there were some 
questions about my shoulder. It was recommended to me that I stay away from 
diving at balls for a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I did dive a few times and nothing happened. I didn't get hurt, so I think I 
can be more aggressive and go back to taking chances in the outfield." 
</P>
<P>
Davis also discussed his biggest catch as an Angel -- the lucrative three-year 
contract he wangled out of the supposedly tight-fisted Mike Port. 
</P>
<P>
"My negotiations were real pleasant," Davis said. "I have to give my agent (Tom 
Reich) a lot of credit. He has a good rapport with a lot of teams, and with 
Mike. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go in and try to play hardball with (Port), he'll play hardball back 
with you. He's got to feel comfortable with you. He's not as tough a cookie as 
I had read, if you go in and establish credibility with him." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Davis established some credibility with the bat, hitting 21 home runs 
and driving in a career-high 93 runs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the task at hand is getting it right with the glove. 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Mark McLemore requested and received permission to leave camp 
Friday and returned home to Diamond Bar "for personal reasons," the club 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
According to Rader, McLemore called him Thursday night and asked for a short 
leave. The Angels say McLemore is expected back in Mesa by the end of the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Angels signed pitcher Terry Clark to a one-year contract worth $85,500 
Friday afternoon. Clark, 6-6 with a 5.07 earned-run average with the Angels in 
1988, tied Bo Belinsky's club rookie record by winning his first five decisions 
before hurting his shoulder and slumping to 1-6 the rest of the way. During the 
winter, Clark's injury was diagnosed as a partial tear of the right rotator 
cuff, but Clark decided to forgo surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to build it up with weights," Clark said. "With some guys who've 
had the same thing, they've healed in a couple of weeks or a couple of months. 
If it's still bothering me by opening day, we can 'scope it (have arthroscopic 
surgery) and try to fix it then." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels will play their annual charity game for Desert Samaritan Hospital 
Sunday afternoon. The opposition will be provided by a group of local 
businessmen, who pay for the privilege of playing an inning or two against 
major leaguers.

ANTI-AMERICAN RANCOR TO TINGE BUSH'S S. KOREA VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In sharp contrast with President Bush's ceremonial visit to Japan, where he 
attended the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, and his so-called "sentimental 
journey" to China, tension will be in the air when Bush makes a brief, 
five-hour stopover Monday in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
The country is simmering with anti-American rancor expressed with violence. A 
bilateral relationship that was once considered basically sound is now strained 
by trade disputes. And much confusion is arising from an awkward retooling of 
joint security arrangements at a time when the Seoul government is making 
ambivalent peace overtures to its bitter military foe, Communist North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Americanism promises to be the theme of the day. Students and dissidents 
have already begun a series of protests against the Bush visit, and they have 
vowed to demonstrate in force on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush is not likely to be threatened or disturbed, or even to see a protester. 
But he might smell something unusual, as the government can be expected to 
deploy thousands of riot police to quell any unrest with their usual clouds of 
acrid pepper gas. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Suk Kyu, assistant minister of foreign affairs, dismissed the growing 
concern over U.S.-South Korean ties at a recent meeting with foreign reporters. 
He said anti-Americanism is "a minority view and a passing phenomenon, despite 
loud voices and anti-American activities." 
</P>
<P>
But there are clear signs that the problem is getting worse, not better. The 
American Cultural Center in the southwestern provincial city of Kwangju has 
been attacked three times in the past month by radical students wielding rocks, 
firebombs and, in one incident, sledgehammers. 
</P>
<P>
After a particularly vicious attack at the end of January, U.S. officials let 
it be known that they had had enough and were considering shutting down the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"If we must close our center to protect human life, we do so, although with 
great reluctance," Thomas Brooks, U.S. charge d'affaires, reportedly told 
Kwangju Mayor Choi In Ki. 
</P>
<P>
Kwangju, in fact, is the crucible of South Korean hatred for things American. 
It was there that former President Chun Doo Hwan used regular South Korean army 
troops, released from the operational control of an American commander, to put 
down a 1980 civilian revolt with tragic results. The government says nearly 200 
protesters were killed, but unofficial estimates of the death toll are much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents allege that U.S. authorities gave tacit approval to Chun's brutal 
measures by releasing the troops, but the charges do not stop there. Washington 
stands accused of meddling in South Korean affairs and propping up a succession 
of dictators. Proponents of a revisionist view of history maintain that the 
United States was solely responsible for dividing Korea at the end of World War 
II and now wants to perpetuate that division to advance its own geopolitical 
aims. 
</P>
<P>
Disenchantment with the American benefactor is spreading among the mainstream 
population too, as South Koreans awaken to new national pride. In the Seoul 
Olympics last year, the crowds cheered for Soviet teams and booed the 
Americans. The Korean YMCA sponsored a nationalistic campaign to boycott 
American cigarettes after U.S. trade pressure pried open the market to imports 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
South Koreans are "annoyed by Washington's 'arrogance' and 'heavy-handedness' 
in trade negotiations with Seoul," Byung Chul Koh, professor of political 
science at the University of Illinois in Chicago, wrote in a recent monograph 
on U.S.-South Korean relations. "Some are even beginning to question the value 
of the American military presence, something that had been unthinkable until 
very recently." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Have Lunch With Roh 
</P>
<P>
Bush will have little time to get into substantive discussions when he meets 
President Roh Tae Woo over lunch. The two leaders are likely to discuss ongoing 
revisions in the joint-command structure and the Status of Forces Agreement, 
the treaty under which U.S. troops are stationed here, as well as recent 
progress toward reconciliation with North Korea, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for withdrawal of some of the 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South 
Korea, however, are not expected to be on the agenda. Nor is the controversy 
over North Korean demands -- backed now by students and dissidents in the south 
-- that the joint U.S.-South Korean "Team Spirit" military exercises be 
canceled next month to nurture the north-south dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush, making the first presidential visit here since Ronald Reagan came in 
1983, may be forced to depart from the script when he goes to the National 
Assembly to give a speech and meets the "three Kims," opposition leaders who 
head rival parties. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging heavy over the Bush visit will be the threat of U.S. retaliatory 
sanctions under the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. After negotiations on U.S. demands 
that Seoul open its telecommunications market broke down in Washington earlier 
this month, South Korea appears to be a candidate for designation as an unfair 
trading partner. Disagreements over intellectual property rights and 
liberalization of agricultural imports are also pending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plan to Cut Trade Surplus 
</P>
<P>
Trade Minister Han Seung Soo announced a plan to cut tariffs and boost U.S. 
imports by 29% to $16.5 billion this year, thus cutting the bilateral trade 
surplus from $8.5 billion in 1988 to $6.5 billion in 1989. But officials say 
they are perplexed over how to satisfy the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that after negotiations, Korea will be excluded from the list" of 
unfair trading partners, Han said. "We hope to explain to the Congress and to 
the Administration that what we have been doing in the past was the maximum we 
could do, and that we'll do the maximum in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Shin Doo Byong, director general of the Foreign Ministry's American Affairs 
Bureau, said that although the "basic fabric" of the relationship is in good 
shape, ties could be strained by continued trade friction. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States should be very careful not to pick on Korea as a scapegoat," 
Shin said. "There'd be a backlash in every sense." 
</P>
<P>
Already, the anti-American theme has become a standard plank in nearly all the 
frequent ritual protests in Seoul. On Feb. 13, for example, about 12,000 angry 
farmers stormed the National Assembly building in a riotous protest over an 
irrigation tax and red pepper prices. They also denounced U.S. beef imports -- 
and mimicked dissident slogans criticizing the Bush visit and demanding the 
withdrawal of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
"The red light is starting to blink for the United States," said Kim Keun Tae, 
a dissident leader. He said that anti-American violence is likely to worsen "if 
America continues to make foolish choices in its Korea policy." 
</P>
<P>
Kim cited the recent appointment of Donald Gregg, a career Central Intelligence 
Agency official and former national security adviser to Vice President Bush, as 
U.S. ambassador to Seoul. Gregg was CIA station chief here from 1973 to 1979, 
and he replaces another CIA man, James R. Lilley. 
</P>
<P>
"He was here with the CIA during one of our darkest eras, when human rights 
were grossly violated," Kim said. "This shows the U.S. considers Korea an 
operational center, where they can manipulate politics."

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY HELD IN PROSTITUTE KILLINGS; 
</P>
<P>
GUN FOUND IN TRUNK LINKED TO 3 MURDERS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A veteran Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics investigator has been arrested 
on suspicion of murdering three prostitutes in South-Central Los Angeles, where 
police have been investigating the deaths of several women who trade sex for 
drugs, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Rickey Ross, 40, who has been with the Sheriff's Department for 18 
years, was spotted with a prostitute in an unmarked county car near the Harbor 
Freeway and Gage Avenue at 1:30 a.m. Thursday, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates said at a Friday morning news conference. 
</P>
<P>
According to a police statement, Ross was held as a murder suspect after 
ballistics tests showed that a loaded gun found in the car "had been used in 
three murders of women involved in prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Number' of Suspects 
</P>
<P>
Ross is one of "a number" of suspects under investigation in a series of 
prostitute slayings, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris said Friday. There 
have been reports that perhaps as many as 12 murders are being investigated 
together, although officials have declined to enumerate or provide any 
specifics about the case, saying only that it involves prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, it was learned, officers have been showing Southside 
prostitutes two composite drawings -- one of a white man and one of a black. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any other suspects were sheriff's deputies, Norris responded, "I 
can't say." 
</P>
<P>
Gates said there was evidence Ross and the woman had been smoking cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
As patrol officers approached them, police said, the unmarked car "pulled away 
from the curb in an erratic manner." The officers forced the car to a stop and 
said they discovered Ross, who was off duty, "under the influence of an 
intoxicating substance." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, according to Gates, "was a prostitute who was concerned for her 
safety." Officers said the woman told them that she had become frightened when 
Ross wanted to go to the trunk of the parked car. She was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they found the gun in the trunk of the car, a Ford Tempo leased 
by the county and used by Ross' narcotics investigation unit. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Ross was booked at THE 77th Street Police Station on suspicion of 
driving under the influence. Then, according to Lt. Fred Nixon, Police 
Department spokesman, he was turned over to the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies accompanied him to his home in Rialto and, according to Nixon, stayed 
with him while ballistics tests were being conducted on the gun. Late Thursday, 
they booked him as a murder suspect. He was held without bail at Parker Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police stressed that the gun was not Ross' service revolver. They said a second 
weapon was found in the car, but they described neither. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victims Identified 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Judith Simpson, 27, who was found dead last Oct. 
14 at 88th and San Pedro streets; Cynthia Walker, 35, whose body was found Nov. 
18 at Flower and 46th streets, and Latanya Johnson, 24, found Dec. 11 on West 
94th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Gates told reporters that their murders had been investigated together because 
the same weapon had been used in each. 
</P>
<P>
The chief said Ross was not a suspect before his arrest and was not being 
followed. Ross did not have his badge or Sheriff's Department identification 
with him when arrested, Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gates, Ross waived his rights and spoke with police, admitting 
that he picked up the prostitute found in the car, but he was unable to explain 
what he was doing with her. 
</P>
<P>
Gates declined to say whether the woman with Ross was a "strawberry" -- street 
slang for prostitutes who trade sex for drugs. Most victims in the unsolved 
string of Southside slayings were such women, police have said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, police have been warning prostitutes about the possible 
presence of a serial killer. Gates said the woman with Ross had been 
"well-informed, well-briefed" by police. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block described the effect of the arrest on the Sheriff's 
Department as "devastating." It was, he said, "a very sad day for the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department." 
</P>
<P>
Block, who joined Gates in announcing the arrest of Ross, said the deputy had a 
"very fine record" and had been "a very effective investigator in the narcotics 
bureau." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Devastating Thing' 
</P>
<P>
He said: "I think it's . . . important to say that in law enforcement the most 
devastating thing that could happen to any organization is the death of one of 
its members -- and close behind that is an incident where one of the agency's 
members goes over the line and is involved in serious criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
Although many of his fellow deputies described Ross as an affable, hard-working 
officer, the attorney of an elderly Pasadena woman who collected $30,000 from 
the county because of a raid by Ross and other narcotics deputies on the wrong 
apartment three years ago described him as "a very intense, nervous 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
Carol A. Watson's client, then 69 years old, was in the hospital when the 
deputies burst into her apartment during the early hours of Jan. 8, 1986, 
looking for drug peddlers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite arrogant about the correctness of his position," Watson said. "I 
could only conclude that either his informant was a liar or that Rickey Ross 
was a liar." 
</P>
<P>
A clerical worker in the medical records section of the Men's Central Jail, 
where Ross once was assigned, alleged in a 1981 lawsuit -- later dismissed -- 
that he and several other deputies searched her purse, ordered her to strip and 
then subjected her to a "skin search." 
</P>
<P>
The clerk contended in her lawsuit that the deputies then searched her car and 
booked her at Sybil Brand Institute on false charges. The charges were not 
specified in the suit. The clerk alleged further that she was fired by the 
county the same day. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was dismissed by Superior Court Judge Jack E. Goertzen in June, 1985, 
because the clerk and her attorney failed to proceed with the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gates said at the press conference that he had not previously considered the 
possibility that a law enforcement officer was involved in the prostitute 
killings. This disturbed Margaret Prescod, whose community activist group has 
claimed police harass South-Central prostitutes and do not thoroughly 
investigate when they are murdered. 
</P>
<P>
Prescod said she and her Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders had 
talked to several street women who had survived attacks and believed that the 
man was some sort of law officer. 
</P>
<P>
"We did try to bring the information forward through the proper channels," 
Prescod said. "It just didn't get very far." 
</P>
<P>
She said that subsequent to one early meeting her group had with police, she 
was contacted by "some women who worked in the area, because some experiences 
they had had pointed in that direction. They said they had passed this 
information on to police, but weren't getting anywhere because they were viewed 
as prostitutes." 
</P>
<P>
Prescod's group was formed during an earlier wave of prostitute killings in 
South-Central Los Angeles. Prescod contended then that refusal to publicize the 
slayings until after at least 10 women were dead had endangered the lives of 
poor black women in the district. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 17 women were found strangled in South-Central Los Angeles between 
September, 1983, and July, 1986. Nearly all had also been stabbed. Most had 
prostitution arrest records. One man has been convicted in one of the killings. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the arrest of a sheriff's deputy spread rapidly among prostitutes in 
South-Central. "I prayed over this for the last few months," said a woman named 
Mary as she stood in front of a motel at Figueroa and 81st streets, "and thank 
God he's off the street." 
</P>
<P>
Others were more circumspect: "So what?" snapped a woman standing at 47th 
Street and Broadway wearing red shorts and bedroom slippers. She said that even 
if Ross is proven to be the killer who preyed on prostitutes, "another will 
come along to replace him." 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who attended John Muir Junior High School and Manual Arts High, joined 
the Sheriff's Department in July, 1971, after graduation from the department's 
academy.

Two weeks ago, when Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
complained that the White House had failed to deliver promised documents about 
John Tower's nomination as defense secretary, White House spokesman Marlin 
Fitzwater blamed the minor snafu on "confusion and incompetence" in the 
fledgling Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Administration critics say he might have been describing the White House's 
entire handling of the crippled Tower nomination, which after Thursday night's 
negative vote in the committee now appears in danger of defeat by the full 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
An Administration lobbyist assigned to guide Tower's nomination through the 
Senate said Friday: "I don't know what the White House could have done" to 
prevent the 11-9 party-line vote against Tower. 
</P>
<P>
But the record of the Tower nomination is littered with missed warnings, blown 
opportunities, faulty intelligence and inept relations with key lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the November election, Nunn and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the 
Armed Services panel's senior Republican, warned President Bush in a letter 
that whomever he chose to head the Pentagon would be subjected to unprecedented 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, both already had strong doubts about Tower, a 24-year Senate 
veteran whom they knew to be Bush's top choice for the post. Nunn, coming from 
a tradition of Southern reverence for the military and a deep sense of 
senatorial privilege, was concerned by Tower's reputation for hard drinking and 
womanizing. Warner, a former secretary of the Navy, was deeply troubled by the 
example Tower's past conduct would set for American men and women in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Warner was prepared to vote against Tower as late as Thursday morning, 
when he was browbeaten by GOP colleagues and relentlessly lobbied by the White 
House to "stick with the program" and vote to confirm Tower, several Republican 
Senate sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Washington operatives, from both sides of the aisle, said Friday that 
Bush and his aides had been slow to recognize the problem he faced and inept in 
handling it. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that's bothersome is where the heck have these guys been since Nov. 
8," one longtime Republican adviser said. "They brought this on themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Member Cites Enmity 
</P>
<P>
One Bush Cabinet member, who asked not to be named, suggested that it was crazy 
to have chosen Tower in the first place because of questions about his private 
behavior and the wide swath of enmity he had created by his brand of 
body-contact politics. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Bush, who has long trusted and admired Tower, may have been lulled 
into a false optimism by Tower's assurances that he had conquered earlier 
drinking problems, and he accepted his friend's word that the many allegations 
against him were groundless. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Bush Cabinet officer said, the Tower appointment is dragging the 
President down like "an anchor around his neck." 
</P>
<P>
Other critics list several missteps, each of which gradually brought disaster 
closer for Tower. 
</P>
<P>
First, they argue, lengthy and public airing of Tower's problems for five weeks 
between Bush's election and the announcement of Tower's nomination Dec. 16 made 
defending him more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush aides had taken more than a month to review Tower's qualifications 
and controversial background, they could hardly complain when the committee 
took a similarly deliberate pace, critics noted. 
</P>
<P>
Once the nomination had been made and the committee's investigation began, the 
Administration made its problem worse by underestimating the opposition to 
Tower and the degree to which the rules of the game have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"They were counting on the honeymoon carrying them through," said a former 
longtime Bush aide. In addition, he said, Bush advisers believed that the 
Senate's traditional deference to its former members would protect Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when the committee moved from investigating into the crucial phase of 
rounding up votes, the Administration appears to have misjudged the one person 
who was held to be the key to the proceedings -- Nunn, the Senate's most 
influential force on defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty inept," said one longtime congressional lobbyist, a Democrat who 
has worked on controversial nominations in the past. Administration officials 
antagonized Nunn by being tardy in delivering documents and pressing him for an 
early vote. 
</P>
<P>
Even when Nunn told them two weeks ago that he was leaning against Tower, one 
GOP adviser said, White House officials did not recognize the gravity of the 
situation. And until as late as the night before the vote they still assumed 
that Tower would survive. They devoted little effort to lobbying the Democratic 
votes he would need. 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Shelby, a conservative Democrat from Alabama and a prime candidate 
for suasion, said Friday that the White House never even contacted him. 
Sometime Wednesday, Shelby, previously leaning toward Tower, decided to vote 
with his party colleagues after he changed his mind, or as one Senate staffer 
said: "Somebody broke his knees." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defections Held Surprising 
</P>
<P>
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said the defections of Shelby and two other 
committee Democrats that the White House was counting on came as a surprise. 
"Our intelligence wasn't very good," he acknowledged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The most the Administration could do was try to ensure that it kept the 
committee Republicans in line by "putting the screws to Warner," one source 
said. Bush himself called Warner on Tuesday afternoon to insist that he remain 
loyal. 
</P>
<P>
Working against them was Nunn, who made a solid Democratic vote against the 
nomination "a test of his loyalty to himself, to his party, to his 
chairmanship," one Republican Senate aide said. 
</P>

INTEREST COSTS RISE FURTHER AS FED HIKES DISCOUNT RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, sending a strong public signal that the central bank is 
determined to continue its year-long trench warfare against inflation, boosted 
a key lending rate from 6.5% to 7% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hike in the Fed's discount rate to its highest level in almost three years, 
although widely expected, jolted Wall Street and helped spark another round of 
broad interest-rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 43.92 points to 2,245.54, and most banks 
immediately fell in line behind Chase Manhattan Bank, which lifted its prime 
lending rate Thursday from 11% to 11.5%. The interest rate hikes will be 
translated quickly into higher borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and 
business loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's board of governors, citing "inflationary pressures in the economy," 
approved the hike in the discount rate -- the interest rate that the central 
bank charges financial institutions for emergency loans -- on a 6-1 vote. 
Martha Seger was the lone opponent of the move. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, the first since August, brought the discount rate to its highest 
level since April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, speaking at a press conference in Tokyo before departing for 
Beijing, said of the Fed's action: "I can't say I'm happy about the rise in 
interest rates." But he minimized his differences with Alan Greenspan, chairman 
of the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Greenspan and I are far apart," Bush said. "We've got a little 
difference . . . on how you read the indicators on inflation . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He said that interest rates would decline once the White House and Congress 
reach agreement on a plan to reduce the U.S. budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has expressed concern that higher interest rates might choke off the U.S. 
economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The increase came at the end of a week of steady rises in another key interest 
rate controlled by the Fed. The federal funds rate, which banks charge each 
other for overnight loans, rose from roughly 9.25% at the beginning of the week 
to close at 9.875% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed fixes the federal funds rate, regarded as an even more significant 
measure of the central bank's policy intentions than the discount rate, by 
controlling the supply of credit to the banking industry. The federal funds 
rate last was as high as 9.875% in October, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The boost in the discount rate followed closely on the heels of two recently 
released inflation reports, which showed that prices at both the wholesale and 
consumer levels jumped sharply in January. 
</P>
<P>
It also came only a day after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady presented 
the most critical of a series of comments by Bush Administration officials over 
the last few weeks questioning the Fed's policy of trying to curb higher 
inflation by gradually pushing interest rates up. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see as strong evidence of inflation right now as does the Federal 
Reserve," Brady told the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
But there were signs Friday that the Bush Administration was having second 
thoughts about the wisdom of its verbal jawboning of Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
"Keeping inflation low is essential to sustaining the economic expansion . . . 
" Brady said. "The Federal Reserve's actions must be viewed in light of those 
goals." 
</P>
<P>
Another key member of Bush's economic team, Richard G. Darman, director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, told reporters that public criticism of the 
Fed generally does the Administration more harm than good. It is "extremely 
unhelpful," he said, "to have overt, visible disagreement (between) key 
economic policy makers of an Administration and the chairman of the Fed." 
</P>
<P>
Darman acknowledged the Administration is worried that if higher interest rates 
"continue over a period of time, it would have seriously adverse consequences" 
on its hopes for sustained economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Budget Bargaining 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to prod Democrats on Capitol Hill to launch behind-the-scenes 
bargaining with the White House on the budget, he said that the recent rise in 
interest rates should give both Congress and the White House "all the more 
reason for negotiating (a deficit reduction agreement) on some basis that isn't 
business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Boskin, the White House's chief economic adviser, said that he 
supports the Federal Reserve in its goal of trying "to keep inflation low and 
prevent it from rising." 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate move also appears to have deflected a potential rift between 
a group of Fed regional bank presidents, who frequently have pushed for tougher 
actions against inflation, and the Washington-based board of governors, some of 
whom had thought inflation fears were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate is set by the board, while actions that affect the fed funds 
rate are determined at meetings attended by all of the Fed's top officials. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Angell, a Fed governor, insisted that "it is way too simplistic to talk 
just about a dichotomy between the (regional bank) presidents and the board." 
But he added that "some of us here are very well aware that monetary policy in 
the past has often led to stop-go policies, and we have a large incentive to 
avoid those kinds of disruptions." 
</P>
<P>
And some signs of tension inside the Fed remained. The central bank said that 
two of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks -- Cleveland and Dallas -- did not 
join in the request for a 7% discount rate, and it appeared that those banks 
would have preferred an even sharper increase in the discount rate. 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate was last at 7% from March 7 to April 18, 1986, when it 
dropped to 6.5%. The rate bottomed at 5.5% in August, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were sharply divided over the impact of the Fed's action. 
</P>
<P>
Some said that they believe the central bank's discount rate hike does not go 
far enough to stem inflationary pressures. "The Fed was too little, too late," 
said A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Against Tightening 
</P>
<P>
But other economists said that they are just as convinced that the Fed should 
avoid any further credit tightening. They argued that recent signs of 
escalating inflation will soon dissolve and that the Fed is unnecessarily 
running the risk of pushing the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed is moving the economy into an unknown danger zone," warned Richard 
Rahn, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "They are overreacting 
to nothing more than an inflationary blip we're in and already have gone far 
enough that there's a good chance we'll move into a low-growth posture." 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts, however, agreed with Shilling that the Fed's action is necessary 
to prevent the economy from overheating and help keep inflation from 
escalating. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Fed waited too long to confront the growing inflation problem, you 
could blow this economy out of the water," said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed 
governor who is chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Assn. "The economy is 
still too robust for its own good." 
</P>
<P>
John Makin, a top economist at the American Enterprise Institute here, agreed 
that the Fed "is moving in the right direction. If they hadn't tightened, 
interest rates would have gone up anyway and the Fed would be further behind 
the curve." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged, though, that signs of higher inflation increase the odds of a 
recession later this year or next year. "They may be doing the best they can," 
he said, "but there are no guarantees the Fed won't make a mistake."

BALIAN LOOKS BACK AT WRECKAGE OF A CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Capt. Alexander G. Balian thought he was "headed for good things" in the Navy 
after 26 years that had brought him a Purple Heart, two Bronze stars and a 
stack of glowing evaluations. Not too many months ago, promotion to rear 
admiral seemed to be in sight. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, Balian, 48, found himself trying to explain what appeared to be 
the end of the line for advancement in his Navy career. The culprits, he said, 
are the Navy legal system in general and a young prosecutor in particular, 
along with unidentified Navy officials and an incompetent crew on his ship. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like failure," Balian told reporters. "And this is failure." 
</P>
<P>
A court-martial had just found Balian guilty of dereliction of duty for failing 
to give adequate assistance last June to a group of Vietnamese refugees adrift 
in the South China Sea. He provided them with food, water and directions to the 
nearest land but decided not to take them aboard his ship, the amphibious 
transport Dubuque. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drifted Another 19 Days 
</P>
<P>
The refugees drifted for another 19 days before they were rescued by Philippine 
fishermen. Only 52 of the original 110 survived the harrowing 37-day voyage. 
They said they resorted to cannibalism to keep from starving. 
</P>
<P>
The six Navy captains who heard the case ordered that Balian be given a letter 
of reprimand, the mildest punishment. Still, the conviction itself is enough to 
derail a Navy career, and Balian was angry. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the penalty was announced, Balian entered a room crowded with 
reporters and talked for more than half an hour before stopping to take 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife and daughter sitting behind him, Balian talked about his love of 
commanding ships, and how this had kept him in the Navy. Now, he said: "I never 
go back to command of anything. I sit at a desk somewhere, now that I'm allowed 
to stay in the Navy. I'm a seagoing sailor. This is not success." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Railroaded off' His Ship 
</P>
<P>
At the top of his list of targets was the legal procedure that led to his 
court-martial, which he said would "make you sick." He said he was "railroaded 
off' his ship and that there had been "behind-the-scenes bad business going on" 
during the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying the trial was unfair," Balian said. ". . . But the procedures 
leading up to it were really dirty, and I think you should know." 
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, he said, he was denied a lawyer or denied permission to 
travel to San Diego to meet with his lawyers to prepare his defense. Of a Navy 
legal officer involved in preparing the charges, Balian said, "That man is 
unethical and unprofessional." He would not identify the officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I would ask the public to look at the military justice system . . . what goes 
on behind the scenes," Balian said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Lt. Cmdr. Raymond H. Carlson, the prosecutor at his court-martial, 
had committed a number of offenses. During the court-martial, Carlson addressed 
the captains hearing the case as "gentlemen," Balian complained, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I submit that's a disgrace. I was embarrassed for the Navy, a lieutenant 
commander talking to senior captains." 
</P>
<P>
"What should he have said?" a reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Sirs," Balian responded. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said he was offended that Carlson accused him of not caring about the 
welfare of the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to submit to you publicly and for everybody's notice," he said, "that 
that's wrong. I care about the refugees. I care about people in distress. 
You've got a guy who's never been to Vietnam, who's never seen boat people, who 
wasn't there. . . . That's disgusting, disgraceful, unethical and 
unprofessional." 
</P>
<P>
Of his crew on the Dubuque, people he believes gave him incomplete and 
erroneous reports about the refugees, he said: "I also feel that the personnel 
that didn't perform adequately, causing me to make the decision I made, should 
be held accountable." Yet, he said, "I'm not trying to take anybody down." 
</P>
<P>
Balian had no kind words for his superiors in Washington. He said they had made 
him a scapegoat because the refugee incident was "politically messy for the 
Navy; the Navy was embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
Balian, who has been living in Sasebo, Japan, where the Dubuque is based, will 
move to Washington and become assistant chief of staff for the Naval 
Telecommunications Command. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will appeal his conviction and press the Navy to hold others 
accountable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not over," Balian said. "Nobody in the public should expect it to be 
over."

AFGHAN REBEL REGIME SEEKS RECOGNITION

<TEXT>
<P>
Afghan guerrilla leaders ended a two-week assembly here Friday with a call for 
the United Nations and "all the nations of the Free World" to recognize their 
government in exile as the government of Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
Their new president, Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, said the exile government 
"represents all the Afghan people," and he pledged that it will move to new 
headquarters in Afghanistan "in one month, God willing." 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats are skeptical about the extent of Afghan support for the new 
government, which was elected Thursday from among the seven leaders of the 
seven-party rebel alliance based in Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Many Afghans have said that the largely fundamentalist alliance does not 
reflect the views of the majority of the 5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan 
and Iran. They say it is not likely to attract large numbers of defectors from 
the regime of President Najibullah in Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
There were already signs that the fundamentalists' hold on the new government 
is not as firm as it had appeared to be. Yet Western diplomats said they were 
encouraged by the makeup of the Cabinet announced by Mojaddidi at a press 
conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mojaddidi said it is he and not Prime Minister Abdul Rasul Sayyaf who is chief 
executive of the new government. And reports that fundamentalist Gulbuddin 
Hekmatyar had been named minister of defense were proved wrong when Mojaddidi 
announced that the post will go to moderate leader Mohammed Nabi Mohammedi. 
</P>
<P>
One Western diplomat observed that the rebel government will at least "provide 
some channels through which assistance can flow. Before, we had a stalemate on 
every decision." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said it will be weeks or months before most governments decide 
whether to recognize the rebel government rather than the Soviet-supported 
Najibullah government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Test Is Degree of Support 
</P>
<P>
"The real test," one said, "is the extent to which this government can draw on 
people from abroad and from commanders in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Another said: "I don't see anything quick. You might see a movement first to 
de-recognize the government in Kabul." 
</P>
<P>
He said the rebel government's first test will come when it tries to take over 
a city as its capital, and added: "How they do that will matter a great deal. 
If it's a blood bath with a lot of civilian casualties, they lose." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the delegates to the rebel assembly left Islamabad disturbed and angry. 
A moderate delegate, noting the deep divisions between the moderate and 
fundamentalist factions that have come into the open here, told a reporter: 
</P>
<P>
"This group of narrow interests has brought dishonor on our brave moujahedeen 
(the rebel movement) and tainted our valiant 10-year war. This shura (the 
assembly) was convened as the last Soviet soldiers were leaving our country, 
and we were promised that it would bring us a broad-based, unified government 
deserving of international recognition. This new government is neither 
broad-based nor unified, and any nation that recognizes it is as foolish as we 
were in creating it." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said Friday that the United States is 
encouraged that Afghan resistance groups have selected a government in exile 
but is not yet ready to extend diplomatic recognition, wire services reported. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Charles Redman said the exile government does not meet the usual 
criteria for recognition and diplomatic relations, including "control over 
territory, a functioning civil administration, broad popular support, and 
ability to honor international obligations." 
</P>
<P>
But he said its selection was "an encouraging development in the process of 
bringing about self-determination for Afghanistan, which is an objective that 
the United States has long supported."

40,000 PROTEST TO BACK YUGOSLAV MINERS' STRIKE

<P>
About 40,000 ethnic Albanians in the republic of Serbia refused to work on 
Friday in support of striking miners protesting ethnic discrimination and 
demanding the resignation of a provincial Communist Party chief, state-run 
media said. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Communist Party leader Stipe Suvar spent three hours 3,000 feet 
underground in a futile meeting with strikers at the Trepca lead, zinc and 
silver mine in the autonomous Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
Although he would not comment on the meeting, sources said he had been told by 
Aziz Abrasi, the director of the mine, that the strikers said, "You can have us 
out only in our coffins." 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 ethnic Albanian miners, some of whom are also on a hunger 
strike, have refused to leave the mines since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Right to Issue Ultimatums 
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, Suvar met with management at the mine, located in Mitrovica, 
which lies just north of Pristina, the provincial capital. State-run media said 
he told the officials that "nobody, not even the miners, have a right to issue 
political ultimatums to the country." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the province, schools and most businesses closed, and the official 
Tanjug news agency described the region as "on the verge of a general strike 
and total paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
The state-run media said 40,000 people staged sympathy strikes across the 
southeastern province, which borders Albania. About 1.8 million ethnic 
Albanians and 200,000 Serbs and Montenegrins live in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters condemn Serbia's drive to secure greater control over Kosovo by 
changing the current constitution, fearing they would lose autonomy granted to 
them in 1974. They also demand the resignation of provincial party leader 
Rahman Morina, whom they consider an ally of Serbian Communist Party chief 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
Serbian leaders have asserted that they must have more control in Kosovo to 
protect the mainly Christian Slav minority allegedly persecuted by 
predominantly Muslim ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
Suvar, 52, accompanied by Milosevic, later flew to Pristina to help ease the 
tension by reassuring the protesters that changes in the Serbian constitution 
will not violate their rights. 
</P>
<P>
In late November, about 10,000 ethnic Albanians took to the streets in Pristina 
for five days of demonstrations in support of two Kosovo ethnic Albanian 
leaders, Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari, who they said were dismissed under the 
Serbian Communist Party leadership's pressure.

Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. and Maine's only congresswoman, Olympia J. Snowe, 
exchanged marriage vows Friday in a private ceremony attended by about 100 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful," Snowe said as the newlyweds talked briefly with reporters 
outside the Greek Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity. Snowe is of Greek 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked around the table four times -- we did it so well, we did it an extra 
time," McKernan said, jokingly referring to the ceremonial walk that is part of 
the traditional wedding ritual. 
</P>
<P>
No governor and member of Congress have ever married while both were in office, 
according to records checked by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony in Maine's second-largest city, adjacent to Snowe's hometown of 
Auburn, consummated a romance the two have quietly maintained for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The two met as Republican members of the Maine House of Representatives and 
served together as the state's two representatives in the U.S. House in the 
early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
McKernan, 40, was divorced from his first wife in 1978. Snowe, 42, was widowed 
in 1973 when her first husband was killed in a car crash. The governor has an 
18-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
The couple planned to fly on a friend's plane to New York City for a honeymoon 
weekend. After that, they will travel to Washington, where McKernan will attend 
a national governors' conference and Snowe will tend to her congressional 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
About 7,500 people have been invited to a March 4 reception at the Augusta 
Civic Center; the tab will be covered by leftover funds from Snowe's last 
campaign.

GROWING DOUBTS DOOMED TOWER, DEMOCRAT SAYS 
</P>

Richard C. Shelby, a freshman senator from Alabama who joined 10 other 
Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday night in voting 
against Defense Secretary-designate John Tower, has never had any trouble 
crossing party lines to vote his own conservative conscience. 
</P>
<P>
As a four-term member of the House of Representatives, Shelby regularly 
defected from the Democratic ranks, voting for aid to Nicaragua's Contras and 
Angolan rebels, for the MX missile and against limits on "Star Wars" 
anti-missile research funding. 
</P>
<P>
Even when early reports of Tower's heavy drinking and alleged sexual 
improprieties began reaching the committee, Shelby believed that he would join 
most Republicans -- and some fellow Southern Democrats -- in voting to confirm 
the feisty former senator from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
But, three weeks later, as fresh allegations of Tower's misconduct continued to 
surface, Shelby's ideological kinship with Tower finally was overwhelmed by 
growing doubts about the nominee's fitness for the Pentagon's top job. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Tower and I share a lot of ideological beliefs and views . . . . If it 
were strictly ideological, I would certainly have voted for him," Shelby told 
The Times on Friday. "But the cumulative effect of all these allegations 
bothered me, and they never went away. It was a very wrenching decision." 
</P>
<P>
Although Shelby is the Armed Services Committee's most junior Democrat, his 
vote against Tower may be second in significance only to that of the panel's 
chairman, Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
If the White House had hoped to obtain a favorable recommendation on Tower from 
the committee, it needed the backing of such Southern conservatives as Nunn, 
Shelby and Tennessee Democrat Albert Gore Jr. 
</P>
<P>
And, if the President hopes to pull Tower's nomination out of the fire on the 
Senate floor, Shelby said, he will need the support of other Southern 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"But he lost us," Shelby said, and the White House's task will be doubly hard 
as a result. The committee Thursday night voted down the nomination, 11 to 9, 
along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
It became apparent to Shelby by Tuesday night that Nunn was turning against 
Tower and that his confirmation prospects had suffered a major blow. 
</P>
<P>
"Nunn's position makes a lot of difference," Shelby said. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby did not come under any pressure from the White House. Although his 
defection from the Democratic camp might have been the crucial break in the 
otherwise party-line vote, no one in President Bush's Administration ever 
contacted him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby said he had received no clear signals from his mostly conservative 
Alabama constituents either. In a recent round of town meetings in Alabama, 
Shelby said, only five constituents had approached him on the Tower nomination, 
all urging him to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Shelby's reaction to continuing new allegations was echoed by other Democrats, 
including Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
"I closed in on it gradually," said Nunn, who said he had believed that he 
would support Tower "not only at the beginning, but through the first few 
hearings." Nunn said the cumulative effect of the allegations began to take 
hold after a hearing at which conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich testified 
that Tower lacked the "moral character" to lead the Pentagon.

TOWER PRESSED TO PULL OUT BUT BUSH VOWS TO WIN; 
</P>
<P>
VOTES OF CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS SOUGHT FOR SHOWDOWN IN SENATE

<P>
President Bush vowed Friday to "win the battle" to save the endangered 
nomination of John Tower as secretary of defense, but pressure mounted from 
Democrats to have Tower withdraw and avoid a bruising Senate showdown next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe he (Tower) is going down the drain," Bush told reporters in 
Tokyo after attending the funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito. Despite 
Thursday night's rejection of Tower by the Senate Armed Services Committee, "I 
will do whatever I can to talk to individual members (of the Senate) and have 
them know how strongly I feel about it," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quayle Meets With Tower 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Vice President Dan Quayle and Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.) met with Tower to plan strategy. The GOP plan will depend heavily 
on a series of one-on-one sessions between Bush and conservative Democrats, 
whose support is crucial to Tower's chances. 
</P>
<P>
Although disappointed, Dole said, Tower is "optimistic. He's still hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
However, one influential conservative Democrat, Sen. David L. Boren of 
Oklahoma, delivered a blow to White House hopes by calling on Tower to withdraw 
for the sake of the country and of President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
And well-placed members of both parties agreed that Tower's nomination now 
faces long odds in a Senate floor fight that is scheduled to begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejected on Party Lines 
</P>
<P>
"We need a defense secretary that can garner more unified support. Polarization 
on a nominee of this importance is not good for the country," Boren said in a 
statement. The Armed Services panel's vote against Tower was 11 to 9, along 
party lines. 
</P>
<P>
Dole, directing the uphill effort to get Tower confirmed, said that he would be 
satisfied with a one-vote victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If you win, nobody remembers the score," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, composed of 55 Democrats and 45 Republicans, it would require 
only 50 votes to confirm Tower because the vice president could break a 50-50 
tie by voting for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Counting on All Republicans 
</P>
<P>
Dole said he is counting all 45 Republican senators as pro-Tower votes and 
noted that Bush will meet personally with a dozen Democrats in hopes of winning 
the needed number of converts. 
</P>
<P>
Other Senate sources said, however, that a few GOP lawmakers might vote against 
Tower, including Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, who has said in the past 
that Tower's name should be withdrawn because of the potential for conflicts of 
interest involving the nominee's lobbying work for defense firms. More 
recently, Pressler has said that he would "reserve judgment" on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston of California, a member of the official 
U.S. delegation traveling with Bush, told reporters in Tokyo that the 
nomination was doomed by the committee's negative vote. 
</P>
<P>
Another Democratic leader, who asked not to be identified, added: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine the Administration trying to get more votes in a losing cause 
when it will be just an embarrassment for the President and further beating up 
of Tower." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Tower Withdrawing 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic congressional leader, who also requested anonymity, said he was 
convinced that Tower would relent and withdraw his nomination. "Our crowd 
thinks the way this will work is that Bush can be seen as standing up for Tower 
while Tower can say he has decided not to put all the senators and the 
President to any more travail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats said that Bush should now concentrate on nominating someone 
previously confirmed for the post -- such as former Defense Secretaries Donald 
H. Rumsfeld, a Republican who served during the Administration of Gerald R. 
Ford, or James R. Schlesinger, a Democrat who served under Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush insisted that he will not give up on Tower, declaring that his 
last-ditch push for his nominee is "not too little and not too late." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I'm going to fight it right through to the end," he said in a press 
conference before leaving Tokyo for a state visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he is looking forward to talking with senators "who still have 
an open mind" and would make his case for the nomination "as forcefully as I 
can." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bush Calls Bentsen 
</P>
<P>
In a direct appeal to one key conservative Democrat, Bush called Sen. Lloyd 
Bentsen of Texas and asked him not to make up his mind yet. Bentsen said late 
Friday that he told Bush he would wait until he sees the FBI report on Tower. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few Democrats began disclosing plans to vote against Tower. Sen. Max 
Baucus (D-Mont.) announced that he could not support Tower, saying that the 
public deserves a defense secretary of "unquestionable integrity." Tower, who 
has been besieged by allegations of heavy drinking, womanizing and close ties 
to the defense industry, should withdraw and avert the brutal floor fight, 
Baucus said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other senators, Boren said that the opposition of Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has influenced his stance on 
the Tower nomination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of 'Partisan Binge' 
</P>
<P>
Although Dole accused Nunn of going on a "partisan binge" by turning his 
committee against Tower, Boren asserted: "There is no other member of the 
Senate who has greater integrity than Sen. Sam Nunn. Time and time again he has 
been criticized by Democrats for not being partisan enough, and I am absolutely 
convinced that his vote accurately represents what he feels is best for the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Others -- including many members of both parties -- said that they would 
reserve a decision but would insist on reading the massive, seven-chapter FBI 
report on allegations concerning the 63-year-old former Texas senator, who was 
once chairman of the committee that voted to deny him the top defense post. 
</P>
<P>
No one looked forward to the Senate debate, which promised to be bitter, 
sharply partisan and intensely personal. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be unpleasant for everyone," Nunn said. "But it will be part of the 
democratic process . . . . I would have preferred that we never had this agony 
to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), one of the Southern conservatives invited by Bush 
to a White House meeting to discuss the embattled nomination, said that he 
would approach the issue with an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
In his Senate dealings with Tower, he never saw him consume too much liquor, 
Heflin noted, and he added: "I liked him. He was a friend of mine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influenced by Nunn 
</P>
<P>
But he said also that he has great respect for the judgment of Nunn, who said 
that Tower's drinking problems ruled him out for a post in which he would be 
equivalent to "deputy commander in chief" with a key role in any use of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.), addressing the Conservative Political Action 
Conference, declared that he sees a conspiracy at work among anti-Tower forces. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think this thing with John Tower hasn't been orchestrated?" Lott asked. 
"The real plan is to get John Tower out of the way so, hopefully, they can 
bring along a weaker secretary of defense. . . . They want John Tower out of 
the way because he has been strong on defense, because he has been a 
conservative and because he is a friend of the President. 
</P>
<P>
"The President . . . knows he's not a saint, he's not asking that we canonize 
him," Lott added. "He's asking that we give him the man he chose." 
</P>
<P>
However, Nunn rejected the Republican criticism, saying: "I've noticed that, 
when I agree with the Republicans, I'm called a statesman. When I disagree, I'm 
called a partisan." 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen, the former Democratic vice presidential candidate and one of the 
Democrats Bush invited to the White House, is regarded as a likely pro-Tower 
vote because he praised the nominee during the opening hearings before the 
Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The two men represented Texas in the Senate together for 14 years and often 
teamed up to advance the state's interests but never had a warm personal or 
social relationship, a Bentsen aide said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Save the Day 
</P>
<P>
Although some Republican sources said that Bentsen's backing of Tower could 
save the day for his fellow Texan, Bentsen's spokesman said that he is 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) said after the committee's vote that Bush could 
salvage a victory on the Senate floor if he "puts on a full-court press."

BLIZZARD SLAMS INTO EAST COAST AS SOUTH SHIVERS IN RECORD COLD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A blizzard battered the East Coast with wind and snow Friday, lashing the sea 
into 30-foot waves, and the Deep South shivered with unaccustomed temperatures 
in the teens that iced highways and froze early spring blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures dropped to record lows for the date in 35 cities from the Great 
Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico as arctic air surged south. Miami posted a record 
low of 37, equaling the temperature Friday in Minot, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
Slippery roads were blamed for hundreds of accidents, and schools were closed 
from Georgia to New Jersey. Three weather-related deaths were reported. 
</P>
<P>
"All the roads are covered; we've got ice, and people are wrecking right and 
left," said Officer Dennis Anders of the Alleghany County, N.C., Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The storm dumped 12 inches of snow in southeastern Virginia, and winds gusted 
to 60 m.p.h., said Terry Ritter, chief meteorologist for the National Weather 
Service in Norfolk. He said it was the region's first storm classified as a 
blizzard since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The winds generated waves up to 12 feet on Chesapeake Bay, and 30-foot waves 
were reported on the Atlantic Ocean, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy cut back on all but essential services and delayed the departure of 
seven Norfolk-based ships that had been scheduled to sail Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is visibility. There is none," said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a 
spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm formed as a low pressure system off the coast of the Carolinas. 
The storm center, spinning counterclockwise, raked its wind across the coast 
out of the northeast, earning it the label of a "nor'easter." 
</P>
<P>
Winds gusted to 59 m.p.h. near Cape Hatteras, N.C., and the state shut down six 
of the seven ferries it operates along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Blizzard conditions were reported along the Outer Banks islands and in North 
Carolina's Gates and Hertford counties, where 18 inches of snow and drifts to 3 
feet were reported, weather service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Roads through North Carolina were covered with snow; up to 11 inches fell in 
parts of eastern Virginia, and drifts 4 feet high were reported in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures fell into the teens across parts of Mississippi, Alabama and 
Georgia -- just a week after record highs in the 70s and 80s brought peach 
trees and daffodils into premature bloom. 
</P>
<P>
Record lows Friday included 16 degrees in Birmingham, Ala.; 19 in Mobile, Ala.; 
23 in Baton Rouge, La., and 28 at New Orleans. Atlanta tied its record of 17. 
Grand Rapids, Mich., hit a record 9 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Shelters in Birmingham opened for people needing a warm place for the night. 
"Anyone can come is as long as they don't cause problems," police community 
service officer Alton Morgado said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold was especially noticeable to tourists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably warmer in New York," Kristin Horne, 28, said in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla. "I didn't bring any warm clothes to Florida. We couldn't even go to the 
beach today." 
</P>
<P>
The cold also threatened some crops in the South. 
</P>
<P>
At Plant City in central Florida, where a strawberry festival is planned to 
open March 2, farmers worked to shield their plants. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how your stomach feels when you think you could lose everything you 
worked for? That's the feeling we're getting now," said Tommy Brock, whose 
fields are east of Plant City. 
</P>
<P>
Peach growers in Alabama burned tires and coal in orchards during the night to 
protect trees against the cold, but there were scattered reports of damage.

A 14-year-old was sent to the state penitentiary because he is a smart youth 
who wants to be a criminal when he grows up, the judge who sentenced him said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager, the youngest person ever held at the prison, received a sentence 
of up to four years but could be paroled in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo County Judge DeWayne Wolf decided Thursday to send Richard Boswell to 
the penitentiary after he was convicted as an adult of auto theft and of 
escaping from a state institution. 
</P>
<P>
"I sat and stared at this kid," Wolf said Friday. "He's a smart person. He 
knows what he wants, and, unfortunately, what he apparently wants is to be a 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
Public Defender Gary Hogg, who represented Boswell, said the judge's only 
choices were to send Boswell to the Youth Development Center in Kearney, from 
which the boy had escaped at least twice, or the state penitentiary.

OVERTAXED UC HOSPITALS TURNING AWAY AIDS CASES, LEGISLATORS TOLD 
</P>

The University of California system, on which a third of the state's AIDS 
patients depend for medical services, is reaching its capacity for AIDS care 
and has been forced in several cases to begin refusing new patients, officials 
testified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The outpatient AIDS clinic at UC San Francisco has been closed to new patients 
one-fourth of the time over the last year, officials said. The AIDS clinic at 
UC San Diego this month imposed its own limit and expects shortly to begin 
turning away patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Enormous Crisis' Feared 
</P>
<P>
"That closing of the doors will happen throughout the University of California 
system," Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) warned Friday at a hearing on 
the university's role in AIDS care. "Then we will have an enormous crisis that 
we will have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, university officials and physicians accused private hospitals 
and doctors of failing to share the burden of the AIDS epidemic -- in part 
because growing numbers of AIDS patients are indigent and in part, they said, 
out of ignorance and prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, 90% of the Medi-Cal funding for AIDS care has gone to just 40 
of the state's 600 hospitals. Seventy-five percent went to just 15 hospitals -- 
a group that includes the UC medical centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San 
Diego, Irvine and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"It is long past time to mainstream prevention and care efforts," said Dr. W. 
Christopher Mathews, director of UC San Diego's Owen Clinic. "We should abandon 
rhetoric which highlights our fear of being labeled as 'AIDS hospitals' or 
'AIDS providers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mathews and others drew a startling picture of how AIDS is swamping their 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
At the AIDS clinic at the UC San Francisco Medical Center, the number of 
patient visits jumped from 1,000 in 1985 to 4,200 in 1988. The patients coming 
into the clinic in recent months are both sicker than in the past and more 
likely to be indigent. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ruth Greenblatt, a physician at the UC San Francisco clinic, testified that 
31% of the patients were covered by the state's Medi-Cal insurance program for 
the indigent in 1988. In the last three months, the percentage leaped to 47%, 
according to a recent study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clinic Visits Quadruple 
</P>
<P>
A similar pattern is evident at UC San Diego where the number of monthly clinic 
visits quadrupled in the last two years. Mathews said 35% of the patients at 
the Owen Clinic are covered by Medi-Cal and 20% by the county's program for the 
indigent. Only 15% have private insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Medi-Cal reimbursement rate is dropping: The percentage of 
hospital charges covered by Medi-Cal dropped from 66% in 1984-85 to 56.3% in 
1987-88, according to Bob Heilig of the California Assn. of Hospitals and 
Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
"The Medi-Cal program pays far less than the minimum cost for necessary medical 
care," Dr. Gerard Burrow, UC San Diego vice chancellor for health affairs, told 
members of the Assembly subcommittee on higher education. "Neither the 
university nor other health-care providers can hope to solve this problem 
without a major shift in present reimbursement policies." 
</P>
<P>
Physicians and administrators also called for educational programs in AIDS care 
for private physicians trained in an era before AIDS. One private hospital 
chief of staff called for a state law mandating AIDS training for all 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one physician was pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Brett Cassens, an AIDS specialist at UC San Diego and in private practice, 
said there are numerous disincentives to treating AIDS: The disease is 
complicated, treatment changes rapidly and even physicians themselves risk 
being stigmatized as AIDS doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Cassens said he could see neither a short-term nor an easy long-term solution 
to the problem plaguing the UC medical centers, adding, "And I don't believe it 
lies in the private community."

NEW CHP CHIEF URGES PLAN TO AVERT TRAGEDY

Maurice J. Hannigan, the new commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, 
warned Friday of traffic congestion and public safety problems beyond "our 
wildest imagination" in the 1990s unless plans are made to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
Hannigan, 48, issued the warning to several hundred CHP officers and civilian 
employees shortly after being sworn in as commissioner of the 8,600-member 
organization. He succeeds James E. Smith, who retired last month. 
</P>
<P>
Hannigan, a CHP officer for 25 years who was Smith's deputy for the last five, 
said California's expected swift growth during the coming decade is among the 
challenges facing the patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"That growth will bring traffic congestion and public safety problems beyond 
our wildest imagination, unless we plan and prepare for it now," Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
He said enforcing the law and educating Californians in the areas of "drunk 
driving, speed violations and seat belt usage must remain our highest 
priorities if we are to significantly reduce the needless tragedy upon our 
highways." 
</P>
<P>
"We must rigidly control the transportation of hazardous materials upon our 
highways, overcome urban congestion by working with Caltrans (California 
Department of Transportation) and local agencies . . . (and) build upon our 
cooperation with allied law enforcement agencies to stem the flow of illicit 
drugs and other crimes throughout our state," Hannigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Hannigan, assigned briefly to Los Angeles as a rookie officer in 1965, became 
the sixth consecutive up-from-the-ranks patrolman to be appointed commissioner 
of the CHP.

PUC PROPOSES NEW PREFIX FOR X-RATED CALLS 
</P>

The state Public Utilities Commission proposed Friday that phone companies be 
required to use a prefix other than the commonly used 976 for services with 
sexually explicit material, that they supply such services only by 
presubscription and allow commercial customers to block those calls. 
</P>
<P>
The action was hailed by attorney Robert Gnaizda of Public Advocates, who 
represented 12 groups that sought changes to protect consumers and prevent 
children from "running up bills of thousands of dollars" with the expensive 
entertainment and information calls. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative PUC decision, which is up for a final vote on March 22, expands a 
1987 ruling that allowed residential customers to block the 976 calls. 
Businesses and schools have sought the option because many of their phones are 
easily accessible but not constantly monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Recorded and live messages intended for adults only would be limited to a 
separate telephone prefix. 
</P>
<P>
The commission said businesses requesting blocking before a specified cutoff 
date will pay $1, but will pay $15 later. It also limited costs to no more than 
$5 for the first minute and $1 for each additional minute, with a $20 maximum 
charge per call. 
</P>
<P>
Gnaizda said the change in per-minute charges was the most innovative aspect of 
the PUC ruling. Pacific Bell, he said, had sought to charge $10 for the first 
minute and $5 for each additional minute. 
</P>
<P>
The largest monthly bill for 976 service known to Gnaizda was $6,000. "Many of 
them (bills) were in the $5,000 to $6,000 range. So that's not surprising at 
all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gnaizda was skeptical about the PUC plan to have phone companies use three 
different prefixes to distinguish between services with sexually explicit 
material that would be harmful to children, and to provide such messages only 
by presubscription. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll never be able to define it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also said that introductory messages must be used to warn 
callers of the price of the call and give them a chance to hang up without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
"While this (revised settlement) does not constitute a perfect 900 service, in 
our judgment it will produce a service with substantial benefit for 
California," the PUC said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to disconnect dial-a-porn," said Pacific Bell spokesman Jim 
Herold. "But until we have legal authority to do that, we've designed our new 
900 service to solve the problems some consumers have had with 976."

JUSTICES WON'T DROP CASE AGAINST EX-JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The state Supreme Court has refused to dismiss disciplinary charges against 
former Los Angeles Municipal Judge David M. Kennick, saying allegations of 
misconduct must still be resolved even though the judge has retired from the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
Kennick's removal had been sought by the state Judicial Performance Commission 
on charges that he improperly favored attorney-friends in court appointments 
and suggested to a highway patrolman that the officer could drop the 
drunk-driving case in which the judge was later convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, in an order filed Thursday, said that when the commission 
recommends removal, the court must determine whether such action would be 
warranted had the judge not retired -- and, if so, whether Kennick should be 
permitted to practice law. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed a series of unusual moves in the case of the 51-year-old 
Kennick, who took medical leave from his post in 1987 after serving as a judge 
for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after the commission asked for the judge's removal, Kennick informed 
the court he had retired irrevocably from the bench and urged that the case be 
dropped as moot. 
</P>
<P>
The court then ordered the case dismissed, but hastily reinstated the matter 
when the commission objected. The disciplinary process would be frustrated, the 
commission argued, if accused judges could evade final resolution of the 
charges simply by voluntarily stepping down. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the court sent a letter to Kennick offering to drop the case if 
he agreed not to practice law or again seek judicial office. In reply, 
Kennick's attorneys told the justices that if the purpose of the proceedings 
was "protection of the public," his retirement from the bench was sufficient 
and the case should be dismissed. But he would not voluntarily relinquish his 
right to practice law, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
"Any decision ordering disbarment without a hearing on that precise issue, even 
if in line with the California Constitution, would result in the denial of 
equal protection and due process under the United States Constitution," the 
attorneys said in a letter to the court. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's one-page order, signed by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, the 
court formally denied Kennick's motion to dismiss the proceeding as moot. 
</P>
<P>
The court gave lawyers for both Kennick and the commission until March 17 to 
file additional briefs on whether Kennick should be suspended from the practice 
of law.

NEW YORKER TO HEAD LONG BEACH MUSEUM OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harold B. Nelson, a New York-based art administrator with a vision of Long 
Beach's potential as a culturally diverse art center, has been named director 
of the Long Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old administrator is director of exhibitions at the American 
Federation of Arts, which circulates art exhibitions to museums throughout the 
country. He will take over the Long Beach post April 3, succeeding Stephen 
Garrett, who resigned last August after a four-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his New York office, Nelson said he hopes to raise the profile of 
the rather sleepy museum by helping it to find a central place in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't plan to make radical changes," Nelson said in a telephone interview. 
"I want to continue and enhance the fine programs that have been going on 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But there has been a "problem" with "a lack of identity that has confused the 
public about the museum's mission," Nelson said. "I'd like to enhance the 
museum's educational role and reach out into the community, which I understand 
is 51% non-white and includes Asian, Hispanic and black Americans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the Long Beach Museum of Art should not duplicate efforts of other 
Southern California institutions. Instead, it should distinguish itself by 
focusing on the ethnic diversity of the community, which sets Long Beach apart 
from Newport Beach and Laguna Beach -- two nearby cities that also have art 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
He also thinks programming should address the fact that Long Beach is a major 
port on the Pacific Rim. An upcoming exhibition of Japanese-American artist 
Masami Teraoka's paintings is "a good example of the interface between Eastern 
and Western cultures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Nelson envisions a program that would continue to show Southern 
California art but with a stronger community context. He hopes to facilitate 
energetic outreach programs and make more extensive use of video-taped 
interviews with artists. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's internationally known art video program will continue, Nelson 
said, but it will become more accessible. Video programs will be incorporated 
within the museum's exhibition program instead of standing alone as separate 
units. And now that the medium has come of age, video artists are less 
interested in simply exploring the form and are more inclined to investigate 
"larger issues" of concern to the public, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda McCullough, president of the museum's board of directors, said she was 
delighted with Nelson's appointment and with interest in the position. "We had 
applicants from all over the United States" who were eager to take on the 
"challenges and opportunities" at "a small museum in a growing community in 
Southern California," she said. The museum currently has a staff of eight 
full-time employees and three contract workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hal has extensive experience with exhibitions that appeal to the museum 
public. He has serving the public in mind and that's what the museum is all 
about," McCullough said. 
</P>
<P>
She also lauded Nelson's experience with grant-writing and corporate 
fund-raising. The Long Beach museum's current annual budget is about $800,000. 
Both McCullough and Nelson said they would like to raise the budget to $1 
million in the near future. They also hope to enlarge the membership, which 
currently stands at about 1,150. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Museum of Art was a city institution for 30 years, but in 1985 
it was reorganized as a private foundation. The city agreed to allow the museum 
to continue to occupy its seaside location on Ocean Boulevard and to provide 
financial support of $357,000 a year until 1990, when the agreement will be 
evaluated in light of the museum's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson has been at the American Federation of Arts since 1983. (Part of that 
time he was director of exhibitions for the San Francisco-based Art Museum 
Assn. of America, which merged with the AFA a year and a half ago.) 
</P>
<P>
At the federation, Nelson has been in charge of a $1.7-million budget and a 
staff of 11 employees. His development responsibilities have included preparing 
grant requests for government funding and soliciting corporation and foundation 
support for AFA/AMAA programs. Nelson has also assessed the merits and 
marketability of exhibitions proposed to the federation. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to his federation post, Nelson worked in art museums. He was head 
registrar at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York from 1980 to 1983. 
For three years before that, he was registrar and curator of American and 
contemporary art at the Museum of Art and Archeology at the University of 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson was graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1969, 
obtained his master's degree from the University of Delaware in 1972 and is a 
Ph.D. candidate at the State University of New York at Binghamton, where his 
dissertation topic is artist Romaine Brooks.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's Saturday morning and you're tuned to National Public Radio, that bastion 
of culture, bulwark of refinement and fount of thoughtful social and political 
analysis. Your host, Mr. Michael Feldman: 
</P>
<P>
"Can you get the flu from ducks?" 
</P>
<P>
"I think so. What do you think, Steve?" says Chris, the studio contestant. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's flip a coin here," says Steve, another contestant on the phone 
line from Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
"I would flip a duck," Feldman interjects. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think you can probably get it from anything," says Steve. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, you can," says Feldman, banging a desk bell for emphasis as the audience 
cheers both Chris and Steve, another step closer to winning wind-up teeth and 
other gifts from the fabulous treasure-trove of prizes. "In fact, according to 
American Health magazine, every strain of flu is in a duck's gut. Try that at a 
cocktail party around the guacamole. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Well, whad'ya know, it's time once again for another edition of "Whad'ya 
Know?," the quirky comedy-quiz-talk-interview-call-in show that is on its way 
to becoming one of the hottest entertainment properties on public radio since 
"Prairie Home Companion." 
</P>
<P>
If all that seems a little incongruous, consider this: a live, two-hour weekly 
program featuring the wit and urbane, off-the-wall ad-libs of a Milwaukee-born 
Jewish host originating from studios in central Wisconsin that has developed a 
loyal following on dozens of stations from Boston to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume there's some appeal of the heartland that draws them," Feldman says. 
"Of course, we're the left aorta of the heartland." 
</P>
<P>
The show has also turned into the latest camp attraction for the high-brow 
Midwestern baby-boomer set, who drive by the carloads from hundreds of miles 
away to be part of the studio audience. And a television production company 
will soon tape a pilot for a possible video version for cable or syndication. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if anyone can explain why it's so popular, but it certainly does 
have a large and loyal audience," said Sarah Carlston, a spokeswoman for NPR, 
which is based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the quirky quiz, now in its third year, took off after Garrison 
Keillor folded his long-running "Prairie Home Companion" in mid-1987, and 
stations that had carried it began to shop around for something to fill the 
void. 
</P>
<P>
That is where the similarity ends, though fans often refer to the newer 
offering as the "Dairy Home Companion." Instead of folksy schmaltz, Feldman's 
stock-in-trade is irreverent, topical shtick. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know my mother still doesn't like Bush," he wisecracked on the air 
recently. "She thinks he said a kinder, Gentiler nation." 
</P>
<P>
A one-time high school teacher and cab driver, the bespectacled, 38-year-old 
Feldman has been dabbling on the edges of audio peculiarity since 1977, when he 
convinced the manager of a small independent station here to let him host a 
morning show from a local greasy spoon next to the rescue mission. He 
interviewed diners as they ate breakfast, but the show was often interrupted by 
bar fights. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of similarly avant-garde ventures on Madison radio, Feldman 
caught the attention of WGN, Chicago's top-rated commercial station, which 
hired him in 1984 to host a talk show. It quickly flopped and Feldman was 
fired, but two years later he was back at Madison's WHA, the University of 
Wisconsin-run public outlet, with carte blanche to develop a new program. The 
result was "Whad'ya Know?," which Feldman says is just a refinement of his past 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to pin it down in print is a little difficult because the format and 
rules shift to fit Feldman's whims. Armed with a portable microphone, he walks 
through the studio bantering with the audience, the show's piano player, who 
performs periodic musical interludes, and callers from around the nation. There 
is also a community salute -- a new town picked on each week's show by throwing 
a dart against a map and then calling residents at random. 
</P>
<P>
It all loosely revolves around a quiz, which Feldman admits is just a gimmick 
to hook listeners and get them to call during the show. Questions, as well as 
prizes, range from the obscure to the ridiculous: 
</P>
<P>
Question: "Is it true what they say about the sex life of clams?" Answer: "Yes, 
they turn from boys to girls. Many have appeared on Phil Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
All this may seem grating or silly to the public-radio purist, which is both 
the show's promise and biggest problem. "Public radio formats tend to either be 
classical or talk- oriented, but reasoned talk a la 'All Things Considered,' " 
Feldman says. "This is unreasoned talk. This is a few things ill-considered." 
</P>
<P>
The show is currently carried by about 90 stations, up from only four two years 
ago. That is fast growth by the standards of public radio but a far cry from 
the 300 or so affiliates that featured Keillor's show by the end of its 13-year 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Carlston said conservative managers at many stations are reluctant to air the 
show because it contrasts with the sobering tone of traditional public-radio 
programming. Yet, she said, those stations that do take the plunge report that 
pledge-week contributions rise considerably when the show airs -- a key 
indication of success for non-commercial stations. 
</P>
<P>
The primary public station in the Los Angeles area, KCRW-FM, ran the show 
briefly last spring, but dropped it in favor of a more traditional, locally 
produced call-in program. However, "Whad'ya Know?" is aired by public stations 
in San Bernardino and San Mateo as well as Boston, New York, Chicago and 
several other large urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Feldman, who spends much of his off-air time alternately remodeling his 
bathroom and trying to peddle the show to gun-shy public broadcasters, says 
such groveling is in keeping with the spirit of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"I do anything I have to do to get an audience," he says. "On this show all we 
do is try and pander."

'PRAVDA' AMERICAN PREMIERE APPLAUDED BY THE CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Brenton and David Hare's "Pravda" isn't set in Moscow but Fleet Street. 
Its hero is one Lambert Le Roux, a swaggering newspaper magnate from South 
Africa who makes his employes write to his party line. 
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch? Adolf Hitler? Those were some of the guesses as to Le Roux's 
real-life model when Anthony Hopkins played the role at the National Theatre of 
Great Britain in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Now "Pravda" has had its American premiere at the Guthrie Theatre in 
Minneapolis, starring Daniel Davis as the dastardly Le Roux. 
</P>
<P>
The critics were impressed. Mike Steele of the Minneapolis Tribune was reminded 
of the cynicism of "The Front Page," translated into the even more 
opportunistic terms of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes 'Pravda' fascinating," Steele wrote, "is that Le Roux is motivated 
less by simple greed than by ego, a stimulus that in the era of Murdoch, Donald 
Trump and Ivan Boesky seems ever more important. The system can deal with 
greed, but it lies down in front of the naked self." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Close of the St. Paul Pioneer Press praised Davis for "a marvelously 
complete characterization -- a cocked head, splayed feet, clenched fists and a 
South African accent of almost frightening intensity. It's a great role, and he 
fills it up." 
</P>
<P>
Sylviane Gold of the Wall Street Journal called Davis' Le Roux "a fabulous 
conception." She was reminded of a Shaw hero "whose relentless logic forces 
(him) to the wrong side of every argument -- and us to reconsider our most 
basic beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Collins, Minnesota Public Radio: "The title is the Russian word for 
truth. In Le Roux's world newspapers are just another branch of the 
entertainment industry, and truth has no role to play. As wild and 
free-swinging as 'Pravda' is, it's true enough to be legitimately scary." 
</P>
<P>
"The Paper Gramophone" really is a Russian play, a love story set in Moscow 
just after the war. Last Sunday we described its rehearsals under director Yuri 
Yeremin at the Hartford Stage. Now the reviews are in. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Kloten of the West Hartford News thought the play and the production 
"lovely and bittersweet." 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Johnson of the Hartford Courant found Yeremin's staging "almost 
unfailingly beautiful, full of images that pull at the emotions and linger in 
the mind's eye," but wasn't totally persuaded by Alexander Chervinsky's script. 
</P>
<P>
Markland Taylor of the New Haven Register found the script "clumsy, unsubtle 
and old-fashioned" and thought that Yeremin's expressionistic staging looked 
"pasted on." 
</P>
<P>
Have you heard the original-cast album of "Les Miserables"? Not unless you've 
heard the French-language album, recorded years before the show was rewritten 
for London and Broadway. It's got a harsh, mean sound that eludes the show in 
English, and it's finally on the American market thanks to a small company 
called Relativity Records. Information at (718) 740-5700. 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE WEEK. Lambert Le Roux in "Pravda" -- "Why go to the trouble of 
producing good papers, when bad are so much easier? And they sell better too."

KURTTI HITS HOME ON RACISM IN 'THREE WAYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Casey Kurtti, a play about racism in America had its roots in a visit to 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminded me so much of our country," said the New York-based playwright, 
33, whose "Three Ways Home" opens Friday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. "It 
was amazing -- because they had malls. They had Carvels. They had Woolworths. 
And yet (a majority of the population) was excluded from society; the 
separation was unbelievable. It really made me start to think about the racial 
issues here." 
</P>
<P>
"Three Ways Home" draws on both Kurtti's feelings at that time and an earlier 
two-year period, when she dropped out of theater and became a volunteer in a 
New York counseling program for women accused of abusing their children. The 
play is set in that experience, exploring the "unlikely friendship" that 
develops between black welfare mother Dawn and the reluctant, WASP-y volunteer 
Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason I wrote this play (was to say), 'Oh, you think you know these 
people? Well, you don't.' " She sighed. "As white people, I don't think we 
really have an understanding of what it's like to be black. No matter how far I 
get with this play, something always comes up that I didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? "Well, the welfare application itself is six pages long, front and 
back," she said grimly. "That's a lot to fill out if you haven't had a high 
school education. And you can't make any mistakes. If you travel from one 
department to another, you have to have a Social Security card and birth 
certificate for every one of your kids. It's a real paper chase. I mean, I had 
trouble filling out my applications for student loans." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of her volunteer work, Kurtti (who's now married and the mother of 
a son, 2 1/2-year-old Malachy) had no intention of re-examining that world on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd become disheartened with the theater," said the writer, whose parochial 
school upbringing was the springboard for her hit play "Catholic School Girls." 
"It had to do with a variety of things. I was going through a spiritual crisis, 
a real conflict about what I should be doing with my life. It just seemed there 
was so much to be done in the world, and I thought 'With everything that's 
going down -- ultimately -- who cares about theater?' " 
</P>
<P>
Lately, she's more optimistic. When "Three Ways" ran in New York, it was a hit 
not only with the critics, but local -- largely black -- audiences, many of 
whom were seeing a play for the first time. For Kurtti, the work also serves 
"to get a point across, open people's lives" -- and in this case, to give a 
voice to a usually-silent segment of society: poor black women. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also interested in acts of heroism," she said. "They can be so minor. One 
of my plays was about a Vietnam vet's mother who goes to a parade and holds up 
a sign, saying, 'My son is in need. Please call me. . . .' I remember seeing a 
photo of a woman doing that -- an older, middle-class woman -- and I thought, 
'My God, what did it take for her to show up there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kurtti saw a similar heroism in the mothers she was involved with. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had been in their situations, I or my kid would've been dead," she said. 
"I truly believe God only gives you what you can handle. And after spending 
time with them, I realized these women were true survivors. I'd had no idea 
what they had to go through just to live a day-to-day existence -- with no 
water, no heat, and kids they had no idea how to raise. People think of these 
women as total slobs, shiftless. But it's just not so." 
</P>
<P>
The experience also forced the playwright to confront her own prejudices. To 
Kurtti, who grew up as the eldest of seven children in a middle-class setting, 
" 'Poor' was never an alien world," she noted. "But I'd never be the kind of 
person who says, 'Oh, there's not a racist bone in my body.' There are many 
racist bones in my body -- little ones, I hope. But those were things I had to 
confront and deal with." 
</P>
<P>
And purge? "Guilt is not a great motivator," she said. "Sure, these things are 
personal, because I understand them. You know, being a writer is a wonderful 
sort of calling. I mean, it's a disgusting job in a lot of other ways," she 
laughed, "but it gives you a lot of free time to really investigate situations 
and get into them. I also felt I could see both points of view -- and 
understand what people wanted to know about, what they had a problem with." 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the challenge is to transmit those stage realities to film, as she 
embarks on a screenplay of "Three Ways" for director Alan J. Pakula and 
Columbia Pictures. "They bought this for what it is," Kurtti said firmly. "They 
don't want a happy ending. They're not saying, 'How can we make this more 
commercial?' So we'll see how far that goes. For me, the interest in making 
this into a film is that it reaches new people. Period."

The networks will trot out the last of their February ratings sweeps 
spectaculars on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
ABC takes aim at the small screen audience with Mary Hart's new series "Great 
Circuses of the World" at 7 p.m. (7)(3)(10)(42). Frank Sinatra, Shelley Long 
and many other celebrities will then celebrate "The 75th Anniversary of Beverly 
Hills" at 8 p.m., while Don Adams and Barbara Feldon return at 9 p.m. as 
Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 in the new TV movie, "Get Smart, Again!" 
</P>
<P>
CBS (2)(8) will counter at 9 p.m. with Victoria Principal and James Farentino 
in the made-for-TV movie "Naked Lie." Top-ranked NBC, meanwhile, hopes to 
continue its winning ways with "The Revenge of Al Capone," Sunday at 9 p.m. 
(4)(36)(39). Ray Sharkey plays the infamous gangster and David Carradine stars 
as the FBI agent out to nail him. 
</P>
<P>
For more cultured fare, KCET Channel 28 offers an afternoon of Stephen Sondheim 
musicals. "Follies in Concert" begins Sunday at 1 p.m. and "Sunday in the Park

SHHH! THE SECRET OF MT. WATERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE Z. COOKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listen up, all you skiers with a sudden, irrepressible urge to hit the slopes. 
There's a quick fix at hand that requires no packing, no planning and no 
schussing to Ticketron to reserve your slot in a giant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, you can test the slopes at 115-acre Mt. Waterman Ski Resort. On a 
bright sunny afternoon last week, when the sky was blue and the snow on Mt. 
Baldy shone like a 1920s post card, a reporter playing hooky discovered with 
joy that fewer than 100 paying customers had come out to play on Waterman's 
four to six feet of clean, real, nature-made snow. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, lift lines at the three double chairlifts were non-existent, 
as was the usual blood pressure-elevating stress induced by the problem of 
pursuing an essentially solitary sport in the company of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a sense of freedom, even smugness, was in evidence. Waterman 
skiers are faithful regulars, and they think of themselves as members of a club 
with a secret worth keeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Want My Money Back' 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pleasure, a real pleasure," a lady wearing pink ski pants and 
brand-new Rossignol skis said. "I want my money back," her partner chortled 
mockingly, skiing between the ropes and straight onto the chairlift. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Smith, a Pacific Bell employee and a former Mt. Waterman ski patrol 
member, was paying his regular visit. 
</P>
<P>
"Practice," he replied when asked about his faultless form. "Like everything 
else, it takes lots and lots of practice." Then he glided away, skis together 
and parallel, each turn apparently effortless. 
</P>
<P>
If Waterman is so special, why is the place still a secret? Probably because 
the heart of the ski resort, the warming hut and the rental shop, are near the 
top of the mountain, at 8,000 feet. From the road below, passers-by see little 
that attracts them. 
</P>
<P>
"We drove by," said Nik Wheeler, a professional photographer who came up for 
the day with a novice, "because all we could see was a little shack and the 
bottom of the lift on a very steep hill." 
</P>
<P>
From the warming hut above, however, the only view is strictly alpine -- 
mountains, pines and snow -- and the only sounds are skiers calling, the wind 
in the trees and music -- when they turn it on. 
</P>
<P>
Though Waterman doesn't pretend to emulate Mammoth Mountain's size and variety, 
owner Lynn Newcomb grooms about 20 runs that are rated for all skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
A third are for experts, most of them on the face. Another third are for 
intermediates and the remaining for beginners with some experience. 
First-timers are advised to come with a competent skier, because Waterman has 
few short, almost flat "bunny" slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Should you decide to visit on a weekend, lift lines will become a reality. But, 
says Newcomb, whose great-grandfather Lewis Newcomb homesteaded a ranch just 
west of here in 1888, the mountain can absorb more people quite comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
"Right after the big snowfall we had our biggest day of the year," he said. 
"We've never sold more than 1,400 on one day, and then it was crowded. Most 
weekdays are like today, though. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have cold nights the snow will last. That's what really makes 
the difference," he added, "not how warm it gets in the daytime. It was down to 
15 degrees last night." 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Waterman first opened in 1939 with a rope tow at the bottom. The response 
was so promising that in 1941 Newcomb installed a single chairlift like the one 
at Sun Valley. The present double chairlift up the face, 2,000 feet long, was 
installed in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Because Mt. Waterman's slopes face north, a good snow pack like the one that's 
fallen this winter can last into spring, even when south-facing slopes across 
the highway are bone-dry. And a late spring snowfall can extend skiing into 
May. 
</P>
<P>
On the steep face of the mountain, where the mile-long runs are rated for 
experts only, a sign at the top warns the inexperienced to stay away. And they 
aren't kidding. The face is steep, and accidents happen each year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a limited number of top-notch skiers usually have the trails to 
themselves. Last week, half a dozen people were skiing the moguls on a run 
called "Wallbanger," while the rest disappeared into the trees heading for 
"Gene's Gulch," and "Robyn's Run." 
</P>
<P>
On the edge of "Bottleneck," Marc Ramirez of La Canada, dressed in psychedelic 
colors and orange sunglasses, and his friend Steve Miller, in a T-shirt and 
slacks, had gotten shovels and were building a jump off to the side. 
</P>
<P>
"We're skateboarders and surfers gone mad," Miller announced, while Ramirez 
explained they were practicing flips for a commercial photography shoot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rentals Available 
</P>
<P>
Beginners without equipment can rent skis, boots and poles at the Ski Shop on 
top for $15. Buy your lift ticket at the booth near the highway and ride the 
lift to the top. A quick wax job is $5, a complete ski tune-up is $15. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bother to bring lunch. The food counter sells hamburgers, hot dogs, 
chili, chips, coffee, beer and pop. 
</P>
<P>
Lift tickets are $26 for adults. Half-day tickets, from 12:30 p.m. on, are, 
$16. Kids under 12 are free (two per paying adult), and seniors (65 and 
older)are free. Call (818) 790-2002 for a daily ski report. 
</P>
<P>
 From Interstate 210 (Foothill Freeway), take the Angeles Crest Highway 
(California 2) exit. Go through La Canada and continue up the mountain for 
about 30 miles beyond the entrance to Angeles National Forest. The resort is on 
the right.

THORNBURGH PICKS BLACK LAWYER TO BE RIGHTS ENFORCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said Friday that he has recommended the appointment 
of William Lucas, a black Democrat-turned-Republican, to be the 
Administration's chief civil rights enforcer, saying that he's "the right 
person for this job at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh's statement signaled that the White House is likely to announce 
Lucas' nomination next week, along with nearly all other assistant attorneys 
general posts. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, who is 61 and practices law in Detroit, declined in an interview to 
support or oppose controversial steps taken by the last holder of the post, 
William Bradford Reynolds, that were bitterly denounced as cutbacks by civil 
rights activists. He said that he does not want to comment on subjects likely 
to be raised at Senate confirmation hearings if he is nominated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights Lobbyists Puzzled 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' selection was greeted with puzzlement and some disappointment from civil 
rights lobbyists here, with one contending that the Administration "has missed 
a golden opportunity to send the nation a signal of its strong commitment to 
civil rights, reversing what has been going on for eight years." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, 
said that the selection of Lucas "is the latest in a series of decisions by the 
attorney general that have caused apprehension in the civil rights community 
regarding the readiness of this Administration to vigorously and fully enforce 
the civil rights laws." 
</P>
<P>
But Thornburgh, in his comments, said that Lucas "has a longstanding commitment 
to the civil rights movement and a record of strong and fair law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Patrick McGuigan, director of the Free Congress Center for Law and Democracy, 
said that Lucas' selection is "impressing a lot of conservatives" and "should 
resonate very well with everyone in the President's base." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, whose maiden and unsuccessful race as a Republican for Michigan governor 
in 1986 turned out to be unusually acrimonious, was first recruited to the 
Justice Department in the early 1960s by an aide to then-Atty. Gen. Robert F. 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The former aide, Edwin O. Guthman -- who now teaches journalism at USC after 
stints as national editor of The Times and editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer 
-- recalled that Lucas was one of two police officers providing security to 
Kennedy who was giving a law school speech in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, attending Fordham Law School at night while serving as a police officer, 
was "exactly the kind of guy we were looking for," Guthman said, noting 
Kennedy's efforts to attract blacks to the Justice Department and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to find guys like that," Guthman said. "They weren't dropping off 
bushes." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas represented the Justice Department during the desegregation of Tuskegee, 
Ala., schools and participated in gathering information on barriers to voting 
by blacks -- material later presented to Congress before its enactment of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, according to Thornburgh's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas served as an FBI agent from 1963 to 1968, then moved to Detroit where he 
left the bureau and was elected sheriff in 1970, the first black to hold that 
job in Wayne County. He later was elected county executive. 
</P>
<P>
In those posts, he had little direct involvement in civil rights. Ken Cockrell, 
a Detroit attorney and former councilman, said that it is "hard to point to 
affirmative instances of civil rights concern" on Lucas' part. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was county executive, he was confronted with budget shortfalls and 
chopping off programs," he said. "He is not a person who has had the 
opportunity to fly civil rights flags" during his elective career. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Lucas was among five finalists recommended by then-President Jimmy 
Carter's screening committee for consideration as FBI director. But his 
candidacy ended after The Times reported he had acknowledged that while sheriff 
he accepted free air transportation on a return flight from a Las Vegas 
gambling junket. 
</P>
<P>
In the interview Friday, Lucas said that he had accepted "only one ride back in 
an empty plane" flown from Las Vegas to Detroit by the gambling junket firm. 
</P>
<P>
His unsuccessful bid to unseat Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, a Democrat, 
was marked by charges that Lucas had a conflict of interest involving a 
longtime colleague and that his wife had defaulted on a student college loan. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict allegation arose when Lucas, as county executive, approved a 
$23-million county construction contract knowing that his chief of staff, 
Dennis Nystrom, held an interest in a company that was to be involved in the 
project. Lucas said Friday that he had taken "sufficient safeguards" to avoid 
any conflict and that investigators found "no wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
The student loan allegation arose when his wife left college to support his 
candidacy for governor, and Lucas maintained Friday that her attempt to pay off 
the loan in installments was "distorted" and misrepresented as a default.

Riot police backed by water cannon, batons and tear gas grenades broke up a 
demonstration Friday by thousands of students protesting police brutality in 
the southern city of Krakow, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
One student source said at least two people were hit with concussion grenades 
and hospitalized and about 10 were detained. 
</P>
<P>
Student activist Jacek Plaza said about 4,000 people, most of them students, 
gathered in the market square of Krakow for a march to municipal headquarters 
with a petition demanding the punishment of police for beating demonstrators 
Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"Police barred the way and dispersed the crowd with water cannon, tear gas 
grenades and batons," he said. Other witnesses said the demonstrators had 
hurled stones at the police.

WESTERN HEALTH PLANS MAY GET NEEDED CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An affiliate of Mercy Hospital has agreed to invest as much as $15 million in 
financially troubled Western Health Plans, company officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed cash infusion would give Western, which operates the Greater San 
Diego Health Plan, enough capital to meet minimum requirements set by the state 
Department of Corporations, Western Vice Chairman Jack W. Savidge said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Western and Mercy Hospital's Mercy Services subsidiary hope to complete the 
proposed cash infusion within 45 days. However, "there is no certainty as to 
when or if the transaction will be accomplished, Savidge said. 
</P>
<P>
In return for its investment, Mercy Services would receive promissory notes and 
warrants for Western stock that, if exercised, would give Mercy Services 45% of 
Western shares. Mercy Services also will appoint five members of Western's 
10-member board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Western, a publicly traded company that is owned mainly by the 1,500 doctors 
who provide health care for the company's 140,000 members, has reported $24 
million in net losses during recent years. Western on Wednesday closed a 
Pomona-based health-care plan that covered 16,000 members. It previously 
withdrew from the highly competitive Nevada health-care market and discontinued 
a money-losing management company. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent filing with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, Western 
acknowledged "substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going 
concern" without a sizable cash infusion. Western's capital shortfall had 
jeopardized the company's state license to operate health maintenance 
organizations such as the Greater San Diego Health Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Western's 140,000 San Diego members should not notice any changes if Mercy 
completes its cash infusion, Keyser said. Those members will continue to be 
treated by the doctors who have contracted to provide primary care under the 
Greater San Diego Health Plan. Members of the HMO will continue to enjoy their 
"choice of hospitals throughout the community," Keyser said. 
</P>
<P>
"What this agreement really does is keep Western Health Plans, which is a very 
important (health-care) plan in this community to survive," Keyser said. 
"That's important to hospitals like ours and other private hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Mercy's investment "will give us the capital strength and the marketing 
momentum to move ahead aggressively," Savidge said. 
</P>
<P>
Cash to be invested in Western will not be generated by Mercy Hospital's 
revenues, Keyser said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercy Services, a "sister corporation," will invest funds to be provided by San 
Francisco-based Catholic Healthcare West, the parent company of Mercy Hospital 
and 11 other Catholic hospitals in California, Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Mercy's proposed investment in Western marked the second time in recent months 
that a local group has expressed interest in acquiring all or some of Western's 
outstanding stock. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, a consortium of San Diego-based hospitals that included Sharp 
HealthCare, Scripps Memorial, Palomar-Pomerado, Grossmont and Children's 
hospitals made a $21-million bid for Western. Western on Nov. 18 rejected that 
bid, but subsequently acknowledged that it was discussing a cash infusion or 
sale with nearly a dozen companies. 
</P>
<P>
Health-care observers suggested that Mercy's parent company agreed to make the 
investment in order to bolster Mercy's share of San Diego County's patient 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercy might want to try and capture the patients that Western now sends to 
other hospitals," said Charles Ewell, a San Diego-based health-care consultant. 
"It might try to develop contracts (with other health-care providers) to serve 
patients who are geographically scattered." 
</P>
<P>
Another health-care expert suggested that Catholic Healthcare West agreed to 
make the investment in order to keep Mercy competitive with other hospitals 
that have been striking up strategic alliances with other health-care outfits. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercy lost out when Community Hospital of Chula Vista paired up with Sharp 
HealthCare, and they would have lost (more patients) had the local consortium 
led by Sharp acquired Western," the observer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mercy Services is Mercy Hospital and Medical Center's development arm, Keyser 
said.

A FIRST FOR BIRD BORN IN CAPTIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
CONDOR HATCHED IN ZOO LAYS MILESTONE EGG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wildlife officials on Friday heralded the laying of yet another California 
condor egg in captivity -- the third in a week -- and proclaimed the newest egg 
especially significant because it was the first laid by a condor which itself 
was hatched in captivity and has never known the wild. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a behavioral milestone," said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the San Diego 
Wild Animal Park, which is home to 15 of the 28 California condors now in 
captivity. The rest live at the Los Angeles Zoo, and none is believed still in 
the wild. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 condors, 14 were born in captivity, either at the San Diego Zoo or 
the Wild Animal Park. But 13 of those came from eggs taken from the wild, and 
the 14th was an egg that was conceived in captivity by a breeding pair that was 
taken from the wild. 
</P>
<P>
The newest egg, however, was laid by a condor named Almiyi, which was hatched 
in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
"We now know that a condor who has only known a captive life is capable of 
reproducing, and that will have to be the case if we hope to keep the species 
alive," Hanscom said. "We can't keep relying on condors taken from the wild 
laying eggs, because they will eventually die off, and we will only have birds 
hatched in captivity." 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that, although the egg-laying itself is significant, there is 
concern that the egg may not be fertile because Almiyi is 6 years old, and 
condors are generally not sexually mature until age 7. 
</P>
<P>
The newest egg was laid between dusk Thursday and dawn Friday in the Wild 
Animal Park's so-called "condorminium" away from public view, Hanscom said. 
Gestation lasts 55 to 60 days, but officials hope to determine within 4 to 10 
days whether the egg is fertile by placing a high-intensity lamp behind it and 
looking for development. 
</P>
<P>
Almiyi's breeding partner was Paxa, who was born in the wild in 1981 and 
captured in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The newest addition is the third California condor egg to be laid in recent 
days. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Los Angeles Zoo officials discovered that one of their captive pairs 
of condors -- Cuyama and Cachuma -- had produced an egg, and it was whisked on 
Tuesday to the Wild Animal Park east of Escondido, because of its experience in 
handling California condor eggs. 
</P>
<P>
That breeding pair also is about 6 years old, and officials say their egg may 
also prove infertile. It was the first California condor egg laid at the Los 
Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, two condors at the Wild Animal Park laid their second egg in 
captivity. The pair, known as UN1 and AC4, are the same that produced the 
female chick Molloko from the first egg laid in captivity last March. 
</P>
<P>
Hanscom said that, although the Los Angeles egg and the most recent egg may 
both be infertile, because of the youth of the breeding pairs, "we're 
encouraged by the fact that they're giving it a try." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
7 Males Give Courtship Displays 
</P>
<P>
Officials note that, between the two animal facilities, at least seven males 
are giving courtship displays this season. 
</P>
<P>
For each of the three breeding pairs, officials took the egg with the hope that 
the pairs would double-clutch, or try to replace the missing egg with another 
one, before the end of their breeding season. In the wild, California condors 
produce and raise, on the 
</P>
<P>
average, one chick every two years. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that birds taken from the wild would produce eggs in captivity was the 
significant milestone reached with the birth last March of Molloko, Hanscom 
noted. But the newest lesson has even farther-reaching ramifications, because 
it offers behavioral proof that birds that have never experienced the wild 
still will breed. 
</P>
<P>
Besides trying to promote double-clutching, handlers take eggs from parents to 
help ensure their successful hatching. Officials say they are concerned that 
California condors have little experience at parenting, and they want to take 
as few chances as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Animal Park officials noted, for instance, that after UN1 and AC4 produced 
their egg on Tuesday, the male, AC4, lunged at the egg, striking it with its 
beak. The egg was removed by technicians before any damage was done.

SOUTH GATE MAYOR PLEADS NO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mayor of South Gate has pleaded no contest to charges that he harbored two 
teen-age girls at his toy store when they should have been in school. 
</P>
<P>
Odell Snavely, 70, was charged with two counts of contributing to the truancy 
of a minor, a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of as much as $2,500 and up to a 
year in jail on each count. The Sheriff's Department began investigating 
Snavely last year after two South Gate Junior High School students accused him 
of touching them on their breasts while they worked at Del's Gifts and Toys, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
But Snavely denied that he touched the girls and the evidence was not strong 
enough to warrant charges of child molestation, said Kenneth Freeman, a deputy 
district attorney in the special investigations division. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing was scheduled for April 28 in Huntington Park Municipal Court.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: EL CAJON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthew Lesure was convicted of first-degree murder Friday in the slaying of a 
2-year-old girl last summer in El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
Lesure, 29, was living with the girl's mother, Katherine Minnifield, on June 13 
when he brutally beat Sarah Toussant and dumped her body in a trash bin on 
South Sunshine Street. 
</P>
<P>
The body, which was discovered by a vagrant, was wrapped in plastic bags. The 
bags also contained a sweat shirt that witnesses testified belonged to Lesure. 
</P>
<P>
In statements to police, Lesure said he fell asleep in Renette Avenue Park and 
the girl wandered away. Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick Clabby argued that Lesure 
fabricated the story to cover his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Lesure faces 25 years to life in prison when he is sentenced by Superior Court 
Judge Terry B. O'Rourke on March 24. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke ruled Thursday that Lesure was convicted in a felony case in 1982. 
According to Clabby, Lesure was sentenced to six years, eight months for three 
counts of robbery and therefore will serve five more years before beginning his 
sentence on the murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated only 70 minutes.

CARLSBAD GROWTH POLICY OFFERED AS REGIONAL MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE YASUDA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blue-ribbon committee charged with developing a regional approach to the 
county's growth issues heard a plan Friday that would establish a county 
planning board and require each city to adopt a growth-management plan. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad Councilman Mark Pettine presented his proposal to a committee formed 
by the San Diego Assn. of Governments. The group is in charge of implementing 
Proposition C, an advisory measure approved by voters last November supporting 
a regional agency to draft and oversee a growth-control plan. 
</P>
<P>
Using Carlsbad's growth-management plan as a model, Pettine suggested that each 
city in the county require the construction of public facilities to keep pace 
with development. 
</P>
<P>
Under such a plan, each city would be allowed to maintain local land-use 
authority and evaluate its own needs for schools, police and fire service, 
sewage systems and open space, Pettine said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regional Issues 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pettine said, a special county board should be formed to deal with 
regional issues that are beyond any one city's ability to solve. Guidelines on 
how to deal with air quality, water availability, transportation, solid-waste 
management and energy would be established by the county board, Pettine said. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that management plans in neighboring cities are not in conflict, 
Pettine recommended that the county be divided into five regions, each with its 
own planning group. 
</P>
<P>
"If two border cities are trying to upgrade a road, and one city wants to have 
six lanes and the other city wants two lanes, you're going to have problems," 
Pettine said. "The subregional planning unit would bring leaders from both 
cities to the table to work out the differences." 
</P>
<P>
Although plans to implement Proposition C are only in a preliminary stage, some 
county officials expressed support for parts of Pettine's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got a lot of merit," said Supervisor Brian Bilbray, the committee 
chairman who also authored the ballot measure. "Some of his considerations we 
need to take a serious look at. One point in particular, the subregional 
planning concept, is something we may be able to use." 
</P>
<P>
Whether at the local or county level, Pettine said, the underlying principle 
behind growth-management plans is to set and comply with "performance 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
A city, for example, would set a traffic volume limit for a road. If a proposed 
development would generate traffic exceeding that standard, it could not be 
approved unless the road is improved to accommodate the increase.

NO MERE SHELL OF A MAN, SHOPKEEPER MAY ALSO BE KING OF THE CURIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

You can buy purses, lamps, wind chimes and floral displays. You can buy picture 
frames, clocks and turkeys. That's right, turkeys. 
</P>
<P>
You can also buy cats, ducks and owls, and tiny figurines that appear to be 
puffing cigars while brandishing pistols. 
</P>
<P>
The pearl that each of these daffy curios has in common is that they're 
composed entirely of seashells. That's right, put your ear right up to the 
turkey's mouth and listen to the roar of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
You might say that Pervez Sukhadwala, who moved to the United States from India 
two years ago, is waging the biggest shell game in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken Sukhadwala is hardly the sole seller of shells in San Diego. 
Shops such as La Jolla Cave &amp; Shell Shop, Silver Sea of Old Town and 
Seaport Village Shell Co. Ltd. have sold seashells from the seashore for years. 
But, arguably, Sukhadwala's newly opened Shell World International on Sports 
Arena Boulevard boasts the largest -- and most bizarre -- inventory. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are shellshocked by the number and strangeness of shells Sukhadwala 
has on his shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"We have hundreds of thousands of shells," Sukhadwala, 42, said as he stood 
surrounded by row upon row of shell after shell. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Hashimoto, manager of La Jolla Cave &amp; Shell Shop, said Sukhadwala 
appears to have the largest number of shells in the county (by a narrow margin) 
and certainly has the market cornered on the bizarre. In other words, it's hard 
to find a shell smoking a cigar anywhere else in town. 
</P>
<P>
Sukhadwala got into the shell business because his grandfather founded a 
wholesale outlet in India and wanted his grandsons to manage it. Sukhadwala 
discovered that, because the United States was by far his biggest export 
target, he could make a tidy retail profit here as well. 
</P>
<P>
Like many sellers of shells, Sukhadwala harvests his 500 varieties from ocean 
floors all over the world. He sells the golden cowry and cyprae aurantiam from 
Filipino waters for as much as $6,000. He sells some shells for as little as 49 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto said Sukhadwala hardly has the market cornered on low or high prices. 
She said shell sales are booming and that her store, on Coast Boulevard in La 
Jolla, offers a voluta shell from the Irvinae family for as much as $1,200. An 
added bonus to Hashimoto's store is the seven natural caves leading from a 
tunnel in the hillside 80 feet to the ocean below. 
</P>
<P>
"People love shells for their natural beauty," she said. "You can't improve on 
Mother Nature. There's a craze going on for minerals and crystals. It's the 
same with shells." 
</P>
<P>
Sukhadwala said he's counting on the "booming" collectors' market. He said 
shells have become one of the world's items for avid collectors, keeping fast 
company with stamps and coins. 
</P>
<P>
"I love shells, and this shop definitely has the best selection in the county 
-- even better than I've found in Hawaii," said collector Dorothy Tucker, a 
retired art teacher from Point Loma who earlier this week was searching for as 
many shells as she could find to decorate a home already saturated with shells. 
</P>
<P>
"What do I love about shells? I love the color, the form, the feel . . . the 
fact that they come from the sea. They have such an elegance about them. I used 
to buy them from sportfishermen off Point Loma, but, for some reason, they 
don't sell them as much anymore. So I was thrilled when I heard about this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absolutely Natural 
</P>
<P>
Zuby Sukhadwala, who helps her husband mind the store, said: "Our shells are 
absolutely natural. Each and every one is natural, in their color, everything. 
None are plastic or make-believe or fake. They're not fake at all. The quality 
is just as good as anywhere. We give out good stuff. Everything in our store is 
natural -- and the best." 
</P>
<P>
Sukhadwala buys from other wholesalers, who in turn buy from sportfishermen all 
over the globe. He said that, in some quarters, shells rival fish as the 
fishing industry's biggest-selling items. 
</P>
<P>
Sukhadwala opened his store in October. His Shell World International can also 
be found in Orlando and Kissimmee, Fla., and in Bombay, where shells are 
considered more an item for the affluent than adornments that just about anyone 
can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Sukhadwala said most of the crazy "conversational" items -- shells that 
resemble Billy the Kid, shells playing poker or drinking Budweiser -- are 
crafted in India or the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the wacky items is greatest here, he said. They're bigger 
sellers than even the locally grown abalone shells. 
</P>
<P>
"People walk in, and they say, 'Wow, I've never seen so many shells,' " 
Sukhadwala said. "It's hard for them to believe that all of these come from 
nature, from the sea. The quantity alone makes people eager to come back." 
</P>

<P>
An initial investigation by the Oceanside Police Department indicated that the 
man was driving west when he lost control of the car, which ran off the road 
and overturned. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was thrown from the car as it rolled, and the vehicle landed on top 
of him. He was pronounced dead at the scene. There were no passengers.

TARZANA LAB TO LOSE MEDI-CAL, MEDICARE FOR CANCER TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal health authorities have decertified Central Pathology Services Medical 
Group -- Southern California's largest Pap smear laboratory -- saying the 
Tarzana company has misdiagnosed too many specimens. 
</P>
<P>
The Pap smear is a medical test regularly used by doctors to detect cervical 
cancer. Central Pathology processes about 2,600 Pap tests a day. 
</P>
<P>
The company failed to diagnose cervical cancer or said the disease was present 
when it wasn't in 45 -- or nearly 4% -- of 1,200 specimens randomly selected by 
the federal Health Care Financing Administration, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider those results to have very serious ramifications," said Harry 
Barba, associate regional administrator for HCFA, a division of the Department 
of Health and Human Services. Nearly 7,000 women nationwide died of cervical 
cancer last year, according to the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Inspections Conducted 
</P>
<P>
Two inspections of Central Pathology were conducted in January. The inspectors 
were members of the American Society of Cytotechnologists, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFA said decertification means that Medicare and Medi-Cal will no longer 
pay for Pap smears processed at Central Pathology. "This company no longer 
qualifies to participate in our programs," Barba said. 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology spokesman Martin Cooper said the company will appeal the 
agency's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the same 45 cases to an independent lab, and their results differed 
from those of HCFA," Cooper said. "This is a very subjective business. This is 
not a black-and-white issue. You cannot look at a medical slide and say with 
100% certainty what you see is A or B." 
</P>
<P>
Medicare and Medi-Cal account for about 10% of Central Pathology's business, 
Cooper said. The remaining 90% is paid by private insurance companies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barba said Central Pathology is one of more than 15 medical labs nationwide 
undergoing inspections because of growing public concern nationwide about the 
practices of Pap smear labs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Number of Specimens 
</P>
<P>
The number of specimens that cytotechnologists are expected to review is at the 
center of the concern. 
</P>
<P>
In some labs, sometimes called Pap mills, technologists read four times as many 
specimens as medical experts recommend to ensure accuracy. Some companies pay 
technologists on a per-specimen basis, which can encourage carelessness, health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Central Pathology said its technologists average 81 slides a day. But it could 
not be immediately determined how that compares with industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
Some studies suggest that technologists miss one of every four cases of 
cervical cancer. Experts say thousands of women have died of the disease after 
Pap smears indicated that their cervices were free of cancer.

BURBANK'S GROWTH BRINGS CITY COUNCIL RACE TO A HEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The signs of growth and development seem to be everywhere in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Gridlocked traffic clogs residential neighborhoods, new homes and apartments 
continue their march up hillsides, and smog hangs heavy over Burbank, earning 
the city a reputation as a hot spot for air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Slowing growth has long topped the community's agenda, and this election year 
is no different. If there is one thing that the front-runners in the 
14-candidate race for three Burbank City Council seats agree on, it is that 
growth must be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attacked by Challengers 
</P>
<P>
Three incumbents running for reelection -- Mayor Al F. Dossin, Mary E. Kelsey 
and Michael R. Hastings -- have been attacked by their challengers for not 
doing enough to protect single-family neighborhoods and for not providing 
effective leadership in dealing with the community and with developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The incumbents have done very little to preserve the sanctity of single-family 
neighborhoods," said Tim Murphy, one of the challengers. "Voters have to look 
at the direction this city is going and figure out if they're happy." 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents say that they stand on their records, and that they have brought 
a new openness and deeper level of concern to City Hall. They say they have 
done much to control rampant growth and, at the same time, have brought several 
significant projects to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"I want managed growth," Kelsey said. "But people have to realize you can't put 
a wall around the city. You can't keep who's coming in out." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, an attorney, and another challenger, businessman Tom Flavin, have been 
gaining momentum as the campaign winds toward Tuesday's election. Murphy and 
Flavin, who both promise to control development and protect single-family 
neighborhoods, have raised significant campaign funds and have been endorsed by 
various community groups and local unions. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is also being influenced by the actions of one council member who 
is not running -- Mary Lou Howard, one of Burbank's more visible, influential 
and popular politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who is in the middle of her third four-year term, said she is 
supporting Dossin, but not Hastings or Kelsey. She said she favors Flavin and 
Murphy over her more experienced colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Novices 
</P>
<P>
What effect Howard's influence will have on the race remains to be seen. But it 
was her support four years ago that was largely responsible for the victories 
of Dossin, Hastings and Kelsey. The three were political novices Howard 
endorsed to defeat two incumbents with whom she often clashed. She said she 
felt that they shared her philosophy of slowing down growth in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, Howard told residents that she had made a mistake. She said 
the majority of the council has favored projects that were incompatible with 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates do not run for specific seats. Candidates need 50% of the votes 
plus one vote to win in this election. An April runoff will be held if three 
candidates don't get a majority of the vote. The top vote-getters would then 
claim victory. 
</P>
<P>
Council members serve for four-years terms and earn $600 a month. The five 
members rotate into the mayor's seat for one year. The weekly council meetings 
are televised over the Sammons Communications public-access cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin and Murphy say there has been too much growth under the present council. 
A number of large developments, including a controversial 129-home tract on 
undeveloped hillside land, were approved. Many of the projects were in or 
around residential areas dominated by single-family homes, and density 
restrictions for some properties were loosened to accommodate the developments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accusations Denied 
</P>
<P>
However, the incumbents deny the accusations. They cited their defeat of a 
developer's plan to put a public storage office in the middle of a neighborhood 
where residents keep horses. They said they only loosened density restrictions 
in special circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin, Hastings and Kelsey have come under increasing criticism from their 
challengers, who say the incumbents haven't dealt effectively with increasing 
traffic and pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the city's Media District, where many film and television studios 
are headquartered, have long complained about traffic from the business area 
coming into their neighborhoods. The residents said no effective traffic and 
development controls have been established. 
</P>
<P>
The city was also named by the South Coast Air Quality Management District last 
year as one of the worst areas in the county for air pollution. The report 
called the Burbank area -- which includes Glendale and North Hollywood -- a 
"hot spot" of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The council has authorized studies by officials to reduce pollution, which is 
emanating from cars and industries. City officials are also studying ways to 
reduce gridlock and traffic, including a major traffic circulation plan for the 
Media District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Taken Leadership Role' 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, they've been talking about it, but that talk has not translated into 
action," Murphy said. "This council has not taken a leadership role." 
</P>
<P>
The council has also been chastised for its efforts in selecting a developer 
for a 41-acre redevelopment site in downtown Burbank. The city has been trying 
to bring a major shopping mall to the property for almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, four development firms competing for the right to negotiate for the 
project appeared before the council. The session was marked by hostile 
exchanges between the developers and council members. At the end of 5 1/2 
hours, council members were still arguing about which developer they wanted to 
negotiate with and delayed their decision for a week. 
</P>
<P>
One of the developers, the partnership of Price Co. and Kornwasser &amp; 
Friedman Shopping Center Properties, angrily withdrew its proposal after Kelsey 
said residents did not want its project, which would be anchored by the Price 
Club, a discount store. One councilman said he was embarrassed by some of the 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the observation of many people watching that the council was unable to 
deal with important issues facing them," Flavin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$160-Million Mall 
</P>
<P>
However, the three incumbents all claim credit for their roles in eventually 
choosing Alexander Haagen Co. to build the $160-million downtown shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about the proposed Haagen project, "The Burbank Gateway," is also a hot 
topic at community forums and informal coffee gatherings. Although the present 
council entered a tentative agreement with Haagen, the specifics of the project 
will be worked out by the next council. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Flavin have both said they are not entirely pleased with the Haagen 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
"This project only has retail going for it, and I would like to see other 
elements such as entertainment," Murphy said. "I think we should have a 
downtown that's alive." 
</P>
<P>
Dossin, 59, an insurance salesman, said he is confident that residents will be 
happy with the Haagen project. "It's the major thing we've done, and I think 
when people see more details of what it will be, they will be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unlikely Choice 
</P>
<P>
Dossin would appear to be the most unlikely choice of the incumbents for Howard 
to support. He opposed her unsuccessful attempts to impose building moratoriums 
and backed many projects she voted against. 
</P>
<P>
But Dossin recently voted to place a Howard-authored ordinance on the February 
ballot that would limit construction of apartment buildings and other large 
residential developments. More importantly, he voted against placing a similar 
ordinance authored by Hastings on the same ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Of her support of Dossin, Howard said: "The point is not whether you agree with 
a person on everything, but whether you can work with them." 
</P>
<P>
Until a few months ago, Hastings, 35, an advertising executive, had been 
Howard's ally in growth control on the council. But differences over the 
competing ordinances have bitterly split them. Howard said she would not allow 
her name to appear on the same campaign literature as Hastings because she did 
not want to be politically associated with him. 
</P>
<P>
Hastings said he brought a new openness and perspective to the council. He 
authored an ordinance that banned toy guns in Burbank. He also was the force 
behind commissioning a controversial memorial to war veterans, and he 
established a yearly running event that benefits the hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Way Out Ahead' 
</P>
<P>
"I've proven that Burbank is not a senior Sleepy Hollow, that there are young, 
aggressive and bright people who work here," he said. "I was way out ahead on 
the slow-growth issue, which the community knows is the No. 1 problem." 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey, 72, said she is running on her record. She said she is also proud of 
her role in the selection of a shopping center. She said that with the city's 
recently adopted land use plan, the city will be able to control growth. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin, 42, an executive with an investment and finance corporation, said the 
council needs to be more focused on dealing with increased development. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I can be a catalyst in that regard, not only with growth, but in 
getting a quality retail center," said Flavin, who is vice chairman of the 
city's Planning Board. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 35, a deputy public defender in San Fernando, said the incumbents "have 
done very little to preserve the sanctity of residential neighborhoods." He 
said he would work to protect those neighborhoods and to improve communication 
among council members. He said he also wants to shore up relations between 
neighborhoods and the council. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is head of the Neighborhood Awareness Committee, which four years ago 
staged an unsuccessful drive to establish districts within Burbank that would 
be represented by individual council members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Contributions 
</P>
<P>
Flavin has raised $13,720 in campaign contributions, while Murphy has raised 
$7,935, according to disclosure statements filed with the city clerk's office. 
Dossin has raised $11,817, Kelsey $6,958 and Hastings $4,097. 
</P>
<P>
Dossin, Flavin and Murphy have been endorsed by the International Brotherhood 
of Electrical Workers Local 15, the Burbank City Employees Assn., the Burbank 
Firefighters Local 778 and other local unions. Dossin, Kelsey and Hastings have 
been endorsed by the Burbank Police Officers Assn. Hastings, Flavin and Kelsey 
have been endorsed by the Burbank Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates include: 
</P>
<P>
George Bonney, 55, a Los Angeles County Fire Department captain. Bonney, a 
resident of the city's equestrian Rancho area, is considered by Howard to be a 
dark horse in the council race due to that area's loyal support. He said he 
would work to mitigate the negative effects of increasing development in 
commercial and residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Morris (Morey) Goodstein, 67, owner of Morey's Shoes on the city's pedestrian 
Golden Mall. Goodstein said the council has not been effective in finding a 
downtown shopping center. He said it needs a business professional to help with 
complicated deals. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kaptain, 30, a personnel recruiter for a stock brokerage firm. Kaptain 
headed Burbank Citizens Against the Tax Giveaway, a community group that 
protested a proposed development by Walt Disney Co. for a $611-million 
retail-entertainment project in downtown Burbank. He said he wants to protect 
residential neighborhoods from increasing commercial growth. 
</P>
<P>
Dianne Adams, 54, a businesswoman and frequent critic of the council. Adams 
said her priorities include building a youth center and senior housing, and she 
cited her weekly attendance of council meetings as a plus. 
</P>
<P>
Lud Grande, 64, a tax preparer. Grande, who has lost two previous council bids, 
said he wants to help with completing the shopping center and would work to 
control graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Paysinger, 53, a waitress. Paysinger said she was interested in appointing 
neighborhood liaisons to work with the council. She also wants to control 
growth and set up more child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
Jules Kimmett, 70, the city's most frequent critic and a regular at public 
meetings. Kimmett, who is known for outbursts that are spiced with baseball 
imagery during council sessions, is staging his fourth campaign for the 
council. Claiming that he is "the most qualified man for the job," Kimmett said 
he wants to make sure that the city "doesn't get taken" with the proposed 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Milstead, 19, who is unemployed. Milstead, who was student body president 
of Burbank High School last year, said he wants to "keep Burbank the way it is" 
and increase tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Perlitsh, 60, a retired postal employee and another of the council's 
regular critics. Perlitsh said he wants to clean up the city's water and 
environment, and stop the council from giving "huge monuments to greedy 
developers." 
</P>
<P>
Other races on the ballot include city treasurer and city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Whitney, 79, who has served as treasurer for nine years, is running 
against Joe H. Adams Jr., a senior state auditor; Dianne Maritt, an accountant, 
and Jim Rogers, a retired bank executive. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Merle Woodburn, who has served for four years, is running unopposed.

'FLYOVER BRIDGE' OPPOSED; 
</P>
<P>
FOES PRESS FOR REDESIGN OF INTERCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Opponents of a controversial Woodland Hills freeway interchange plan said 
Friday that they may file suit to force state and city traffic engineers to 
redesign the project. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the newly formed Concerned Citizens for Valley Circle/Mulholland 
Interchange said there is unified community opposition to the unusual design 
proposed for the $40-million Valley Circle Boulevard interchange. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation officials want the long-planned interchange to include a widened 
north-south bridge at Valley Circle Boulevard plus a secondary east-west bridge 
over the Ventura Freeway that would link Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills 
with Calabasas Road in Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
They say such a design is the only one of several alternatives they have 
studied that will adequately handle future traffic at the southwestern edge of 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But some nearby property owners have objected to the secondary freeway "flyover 
bridge." They maintain that it would funnel heavy Woodland Hills traffic into 
the area of Old Calabasas and accelerate development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overly Expensive 
</P>
<P>
About 175 residents attending a Thursday night meeting called by the Concerned 
Citizens group were told that an independent traffic expert believes that a 
flyover bridge would be overly expensive and will not remedy future traffic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a straw poll after the presentation, those attending voted by a 2-to-1 
margin to support construction of a conventional interchange without the 
flyover bridge, said Bill Bridgers, an organizer of the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We're debating our next step now," Bridgers said Friday. "We will turn over 
the results of the poll to our elected representatives." 
</P>
<P>
Bridgers said city and state officials have been promoting construction of a 
Valley Circle interchange for 20 years and are unlikely to allow transportation 
engineers to shelve the project now. 
</P>
<P>
If the politicians do not intercede, "we're considering a class-action 
lawsuit," Bridgers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to do it if there's a way to avoid it. We don't want to stand in 
the way of the project. We all want a new interchange. But we want to protect 
Old Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the flyover bridge have argued that it would cram four lanes of Ventura 
Boulevard traffic onto two-lane Calabasas Road unless the road was widened. To 
widen it, land in front of the 145-year-old Leonis Adobe museum and in front of 
quaint Old Calabasas storefronts would be paved over. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute prompted state Department of Transportation planners and engineers 
from the Los Angeles City Department of Transportation to slightly modify the 
design last month. 
</P>
<P>
The revised plan would direct some of the potential flyover bridge traffic away 
from the Old Calabasas area and eliminate the need to widen Calabasas Road, 
according to the engineers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warning Issued 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, city officials and state legislators warned that the 
interchange project probably will not be built unless the flyover bridge is 
included. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday at the bridge site, City Councilwoman Joy Picus 
said there is "strong, broad-based community support" for the flyover bridge. 
She warned that funding for the project will be withdrawn unless the Ventura 
Boulevard-Calabasas Road connection is built. 
</P>
<P>
"Caltrans has stated that the preferred alternative is the only one it will 
fund because it is the only plan that will handle the traffic," Picus said. 
"The state won't build an interchange that won't work." 
</P>
<P>
State traffic engineers in charge of the project were unavailable for comment 
Friday. Officials have said they hope to build the new interchange -- which 
would be partially paid for by the city -- in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, supporters of the flyover bridge concept were launching a campaign 
to counter Bridgers' Concerned Citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
People entering Thursday night's forum at El Camino Real High School were 
handed "fact sheets" designed to refute the position of the anti-flyover bridge 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is a group representing itself as 'Concerned Citizens' advocating that 
millions be spent on a freeway interchange design which the state and city 
professional engineers know to be inadequate to handle the traffic?" the 
handout asked.

NO DRUG CENTER IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iam opposed to the planned Phoenix House/Nancy Reagan Center's being located in 
Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of Lake View Terrace, I am familiar with the proposed site and 
think that far more suitable locations are available elsewhere. The site in 
question, a former medical center, is surrounded by single-family homes and has 
two schools nearby. 
</P>
<P>
I realize the Valley needs such a facility. However, it is time another 
community assumes this responsibility. Lake View Terrace already contains 
several facilities for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse, a sanitarium

SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH CHATSWORTH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Gabe Fuentes' article (Jan. 11) on the environmental impact 
report of a proposed $2-billion, 1,300-acre residential and commercial 
development in Chatsworth, I felt a need to comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the estimated 164,840 daily traffic trips generated by 
the year 2010 would have a negligible effect on traffic because the builder 
plans to extend many unfinished roadways near the project. Who is he kidding? 
Is he going to build a second level on the freeways surrounding Chatsworth or 
does he think every resident will work within a one-mile radius of the project? 
</P>
<P>
Also, the builder says he will pay $15 million for new schools. Won't children 
be bused to these new schools, further aggravating traffic conditions? 
</P>
<P>
I realize that all growth should not and cannot be stopped, but if this is an 
example of a favorable environmental impact report, something is wrong with the 
system.

TIME NEEDED ON LANDFILL REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is essential that additional time be granted for the community to respond to 
the draft environmental impact report on the Lopez Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Documents sent to those who responded to the pre-draft EIR was approximately 
one inch thick. Supplemental material was not included. Upon investigation, it 
was found that the supplementary documents were over six inches thick, not 
including the transportation report. 
</P>
<P>
The undersigned attempted to buy the supplemental material and was refused by 
the Sanitation Department and the firm that prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to plow through this huge volume of material at a local library is an 
impossible task when one realizes that only one copy is in a library and most 
persons have other occupations during library hours. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems concerning the report is the discovery that one portion is 
in dispute with another; illustration of the same cross sections do not agree 
within the documents. There are also many errors including, but not limited to, 
the exact location of the landfill boundaries; one map does not agree with 
another; the statement that water from Lopez Canyon goes into the Lopez Dam, 
when actually it goes into the Hansen Dam then into the aquifer from which Los 
Angeles, Glendale and Burbank extract drinking water; that an active fault is 
only on the southerly edge of the landfill, when it actually lies beneath the 
entire site as depicted by a State Mine and Geology map contained elsewhere in 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
Also, that hazardous material could find its way northward and eastward to the 
wells in upper Kagel Canyon, but that those wells furnish water for irrigation 
and firefighting only when actually they produce the drinking water for that 
community, and that surface water from the landfill would not contaminate the 
aquifer to the south when the analytical report indicates that samples of 
ground water in Bartholamaus Canyon contain solvents such as trichlorobenzene, 
trichlorophenol and chloronaphthalene as well as heavy metals such as lead, 
chromium and arsenic. 
</P>
<P>
Omissions have taken time to discover and research, such as diseases contained 
in sewer sludge including paratyphoid fever, salmonellosis, cholera and 
hepatitis, which can be carried in the air or by flies, mosquitoes, rodents and 
other vectors to the nearby residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
We must be granted an extension of time to address adequately this draft EIR.

DISPUTE IN BURBANK; 
</P>
<P>
BOARD RULES CANDIDATE'S SON IS IN SCHOOL ILLEGALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank Board of Education has ruled that a candidate running for one of 
two open seats on the board does not live in the city and cannot send his son 
to junior high school there. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member board unanimously agreed Thursday after five nights of hearings 
that S. Michael Stavropoulos, 50, a neurosurgeon, had lied about his address 
and did not live within school district boundaries. Stavropoulos has said since 
last fall that he lives at 634 E. Walnut Ave. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the board has ruled that Stavropoulos was keeping a 
false residence. Stavropoulos sued the district in October when the board voted 
to remove his son from school. Burbank Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Murphy 
ordered the board to re-hear the case because he said a transcript of the 
October hearing was unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
The decision probably will result in the removal of Stavropoulos' 14-year-old 
son, Michael, from John Muir Junior High School. The youth has been attending 
the school under a court order until the case is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Arthur Pierce said the board's conclusion was based on sworn testimony 
and documentation, such as tax records, that show Stavropoulos does not reside 
at the house. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce said the school district's attorneys next week will present the board's 
decision to Murphy, who will decide whether Stavropoulos' son is to be removed 
from John Muir. 
</P>
<P>
However, the board's decision will have no effect on Stavropoulos' campaign. 
The city's municipal election is Tuesday. But if Stavropoulos is elected, the 
city clerk's office will investigate the residency question, City Clerk Merle 
Woodburn said. Stavropoulos signed an affidavit swearing he is a resident of 
the city, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos said the board's conclusion is proof that the panel "is trying to 
manipulate the will of the people in this election. I'm confident that the 
people will not be fooled. The board is insulting the intelligence of the 
voters. I'm confident I will be vindicated by the voters and the courts." 
</P>
<P>
Stavropoulos said he will fight the board's decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Audrey Hanson, one of two incumbents running for reelection, 
said the evidence shows Stavropoulos lives at a Hollywood address. She said 
several residents living on and around Walnut Avenue testified that 
Stavropoulos often visited the house but did not live there.

MARSHALL RALLIES SADDLEBACK, 65-61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE LOWERY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Left for dead midway through the first quarter -- when it trailed 11-1 -- and 
seemingly just hanging on throughout the game, the Saddleback High School boys' 
basketball team somehow found a way to beat Lakewood, 65-61, in overtime in the 
semifinals of the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs before an overflow crowd of 
3,200 Friday at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
A good portion of that somehow was 6-foot-1 guard Craig Marshall, who scored 21 
points, many on attempts that ranged from far-fetched to simply far. 
</P>
<P>
"This game was Craig Marshall's," said Malru Dottin, Saddleback's center. "He 
sparked all of us. They were dropping three guys in on me and I just threw the 
ball out to him and let him do the job, and he did." 
</P>
<P>
It was a spinning, reverse, two-handed layup by Marshall that drew Saddleback 
(27-1) to within 52-50 with 2:32 left in regulation. Marshall was fouled on the 
play by Lakewood forward Brian Camper, who came into the game averaging 21 
points a game. Camper, who had 11 points Friday, fouled out on the play. 
Marshall missed the free throw but rebounded the shot and got the ball to 
Dottin, whose five-foot jumper went in and came out. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood (23-7), which had a 30-23 lead at halftime and a 38-29 lead midway 
through the third quarter, then scored to go up 54-50 with 1:28 left. But 
Saddleback's Jimmy Galbert drove for a basket with 1:14 left, and Dottin made a 
leaning eight-footer from the left side of the key that tied the score at 
54-54, which is how it remained in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, Galbert drove for a basket and was fouled. His free throw gave 
Saddleback a 57-54 lead with 2:48 left. After a Lakewood basket, Marshall made 
a short jump shot to put his team up, 59-56. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood guard Tom Sellers made a three-pointer to draw Lakewood to within two 
at 61-59 with 1:23 left. Saddleback spread its offense, and Marshall darted in 
for a drive and basket with 47 seconds left. The teams traded baskets and 
Saddleback had earned its first berth in a Southern Section basketball final. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole thing is like a movie," said Pat Quinn, Saddleback coach. "We're 
behind, behind, behind the whole game, but these kids stuck at them. They 
wouldn't quit." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall made three three-pointers in the first quarter, and Saddleback made 
seven three-pointers in the game. Marshall's leaning 25-footer at the buzzer, 
capped a six-point Saddleback surge that left it trailing, 16-13, at the end of 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We just weren't ready to play in the first quarter," Dottin said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, it was Lakewood that seemed less than willing to play. The 
Lancers used a spread offense for much of the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played good defense all year and they seemed to get a little tentative 
as the game went on," Quinn said. "Then the breaks started going our way."

PADRES COMPLETE AS SHOW SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
OPENING DAY, CONTRACT AMONG THE THINGS ON HIS MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last missing player reported to Padre spring training Friday, and it became 
official that pitcher Eric Show had been in bed all week with the flu. The 
announcement was made by his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Either he had the flu," pitching coach Pat Dobson observed, "or he's been 
sleeping on a flour bag all winter." 
</P>
<P>
A pale Show -- six days late and nearly a waist size lighter -- showed up just 
in time to impressively complete a workout that included 12 minutes of strong 
pitching. Afterward he quickly showered, dressed, and begged forgiveness for 
hustling to the nearest bed, lest someone need to carry him there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not right," he said. "How sick? I'm sick enough. I don't know how to 
measure that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Show, an eight-year veteran coming off his best season, did stick around long 
enough to talk about the two things that could make his month here, well, a bit 
queasy. 
</P>
<P>
1) It appears the opening day starting assignment, April 3 in San Diego against 
San Francisco, is his. The Padre bosses, who can't comment openly on this now, 
will likely make final decision after Show's fourth spring start, in which he 
is scheduled to go five innings for a second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
If at that time he is still in possession of an elbow and fingers, he will be 
the pick. This should make Show uneasy but happy. 
</P>
<P>
2) It appears he and agent Steve Greenberg are having problems with his new 
contract, worth a potential $3.6 million over three years, one an option year. 
When it was signed in mid-October, the Padres weren't giving out three-year 
guarantees. Then baseball's economics suddenly changed, and Bruce Hurst and 
Tony Gwynn got them. This could made Show uneasy, and unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
Wherever he decides to end up emotionally, he is starting off with a surer step 
than last spring, when Dobson said Show would finally learn to reach his 
potential, or they would both die trying. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if Show was his biggest project last season, Dobson said, "Yeah. He 
was pretty headstrong. (Pause) But I was pretty headstrong too. We battled 
there for a while. But now I actually feel pretty close to him." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the relationship was forged on Show's splendid 1988 finish, when he won 
his last five starts and nine of his last 10 decisions. He finished with a 
career high 16 victories (with 11 losses) including 13 complete games, the most 
by a Padre in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the stat that really made Dobson happy -- Show walked just 53 
men in 234 2/3 innings, only two per inning. The Padre staff wound up with a 
team record for fewest walks (439), Dobson was given a nice contract, and all 
was forgiven -- including the loud argument June 24 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
You might remember. That's where, because of questionable fielding, Show gave 
up four runs in the first inning of an eventual 4-3 loss to the Braves. He, not 
the fielders, were later criticized by Manager Jack McKeon and Dobson. Show 
heard the criticism and confronted the pair, setting off a match of raised 
voices. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the clubhouse, Show ended it by looking at Dobson and saying, 
"I'm ashamed for you, Dobber." 
</P>
<P>
Eight months later, Dobson is proud of Show, so proud that he is pushing him 
for the opening day start. 
</P>
<P>
"After that game, I think he really progressed and became able to face a lot of 
things without rattling," Dobson said. "Errors didn't rattle him, tiny hits 
didn't rattle him, he showed he could cope with all the bull. He became a lot 
more aggressive, almost like, 'I'm going to show you, guys.' That's the kind of 
guy you want out there for you opening day." 
</P>
<P>
It would be Show's fourth opening day start, all within the past six years. 
Where last season he went along with Larry Bowa's experiment to save him for 
the third game and ease off the pressure, this year he says he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat (Dobson) and I talked about it, he asked how I felt about it, and I said 
it's fine," Show said. "I turned it down last year at Bowa's behest, we mixed 
it all up, and it didn't really work (the Padres dropped their first five 
games). 
</P>
<P>
"So yeah, it's OK with me. But it's still no big deal. It's just another game, 
but with a lot more hoopla." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitson, who pitched his first opening day last season, said it was also 
fine with him: "All it is is more publicity. I don't need any more of that. 
I'll just take my starts and go on home." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst, whom you might think would be the opening day starter if you 
didn't understand McKeon's and Dobson's sense of loyalty, also does not mind. 
"It's not that big of a start when you consider some of the ones you'll make 
later," said Hurst, speaking from playoff and World Series experience. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Dobson thinks opening day is an honor, and Show is worthy of it. 
</P>
<P>
"After the way he pitched last year, he's earned it," Dobson said. "Bruce Hurst 
pitched great last year, too. But he did it in Boston." 
</P>
<P>
Now for Show's spring fever. His agent, Greenberg, said Friday that the Padres 
changed their fiscal policy within "a couple of weeks" of signing free agent 
Show. He said he wants Show's contract to include that change. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially he wants Show's third year, currently at the club's option and 
worth $1.4 million, to be guaranteed, and perhaps for more Bruce Hurst-type 
money ($1.6 million) while the Padres are at it. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' problem is that the contract already heavily weighs in Show's 
favor. If he throws 175 innings in either of the next two years, the option is 
automatically guaranteed. Show has topped 200 innings in five of the past six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the third year contains a unique arbitration clause: If Show's $1.4 
million salary isn't market value, he could take the club to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't expect this to be a big deal," said Dick Freeman, the Padres' 
interim president. "We've had general discussions with the agent, and I'll sit 
down with Eric one of these days, and we'll just chat." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Show will walk out of camp, according to Greenberg. But he 
already has been burned by signing too early and not testing a free agent 
market that later went haywire. Any further perceived burns might not be good 
employee relations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like if you have two kids, and you tell one he has a 10 p.m. curfew, and 
then a couple of weeks later when the other kid goes out, you change the curfew 
to midnight," Greenberg explained. "Shouldn't you let the first kid come home 
at midnight, too? 
</P>
<P>
"When we signed, we were told certain policy things couldn't be changed. Then a 
couple of weeks later, the policy is turned on its head. We just think it's a 
logical question to ask that our contract discussions be revisited." 
</P>
<P>
Show, a jazz guitarist who had a difficult enough winter producing two jazz 
albums under his own label, said he prefers not to discuss money yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just thankful for the opportunity to play here," Show said. "My money is 
not mega-mega-mega, but it's still pretty good. I wouldn't even think about 
leaving camp over it. It just want to get working and get that Yuma feeling 
again." 
</P>
<P>
There's a song title in there somewhere. By now, you've probably figured that 
nothing Eric Show does, not even simply showing up at training camp, is less 
than lyrical.

PITINO, EWING ARE MAKING KNICKS WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA McKEE, The Baltimore Evening Sun

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In New York, style is everything. Certainly that is the case with Patrick Ewing 
and the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing was drafted by the Knicks in 1985, but it seems he has only just arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The ho-hum Knicks have been transformed into the rah-rah Knicks by Coach Rick 
Pitino. After taking Providence to the 1987 NCAA Final Four, Pitino took his 
running, pressing style of play with him to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Knicks fans, the prime beneficiary of this stylish switch has been 
one Patrick Ewing, who according to Pitino can do almost anything -- except, 
perhaps, leap over skyscrapers in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing everything for us," says Pitino. "Scoring, forcing movement away 
from him. He's rebounding better, staying down on head fakes, passing. I think 
Patrick Ewing can be mentioned in the same breath with Jordan, Bird and Magic." 
</P>
<P>
Going into Friday night's game against the Washington Bullets in Baltimore, 
Ewing was averaging 21.3 points, 8.6 rebounds, 3.38 blocks. He was also 
shooting 55% from the field and was averaging 2.3 assists, but had handed out 
21 assists in his last six games, a 3.5 average. 
</P>
<P>
"The style Coach Pitino brought here is the same as what we did at Georgetown," 
says Ewing. "We run and we press. I'm a running center. I can beat any center 
down the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The transformation of the Knicks began last season, Pitino's first. After three 
consecutive years at the bottom of the Atlantic Division, the Knicks finished 
third in 1987-88 and made the playoffs with a 38-44 record. 
</P>
<P>
Before Pitino arrived, opposing teams were able to push around the 7-foot, 
240-pound center. They would double- and triple-team, knock him to the floor, 
bruise him, force him to the sidelines for repair. In his first two years in 
the NBA, Ewing was an easy target on a Knick team that had little else going 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
"In those earlier years, the Knicks relied on him, but there was too much 
pressure," says Bullets Coach Wes Unseld. "Not only the pressure he put on 
himself and the pressure he felt from his own team, but from other teams. 
They'd double-team him inside, because everyone knew the outside jumper was no 
worry." 
</P>
<P>
But those days are gone. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ewing is still the cornerstone, but he is not alone. In the starting 
lineup are guards Mark Jackson and Gerald Wilkins and forwards Charles Oakley 
and Johnny Newman. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing the NBA's Atlantic Division leaders seemed to need was more 
scoring production at small forward. That problem evidently has been solved 
with Thursday's acquisition of Portland's Kiki Vandeweghe in exchange for a 
first-round draft choice in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
With Jackson at point guard, the Knicks' ball-handling is in good hands. With 
the arrival of Oakley -- a bruising 6-9, 245-pounder who came from the Chicago 
Bulls in exchange for center Bill Cartwright -- Ewing is at last free to do 
what it is he does best: run the floor, score, block shots and work the inside 
on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I love playing alongside him," says Oakley. "The big guy is The Man." 
</P>
<P>
"When Oakley went to the Knicks," says Bullet assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik, 
"there was a lot of doubt about whether he'd fit in. That question doesn't 
exist anymore. Oakley is a tremendous athlete and he causes a lot of problems 
for opponents with his outstanding rebounding. You've got to concentrate on 
Oakley. He plays the high post and that means you can't double-team Patrick and 
rotate, because you need a big body on Oakley, and that hurts the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
"And one-on-one, Patrick Ewing is going to kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Bullets forward Charlie Jones says, "One guy can't defend him. Patrick is real 
tough. He's strong and likes the low post position." 
</P>
<P>
Houston center Akeem Olajuwon spent Tuesday night trying to move Ewing out of 
position. The Knicks won, 120-115, and Olajuwon had all he wanted from Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
"With him, you can never relax," Olajuwon says. "You play him physical because 
you have to. But even with your body on him, he's still strong enough to get 
off his shot anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Ewing's defense. The Knicks' pressing style forces every player 
on the opposing team to handle the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"On most teams, it's one or two guys at most who you want to put the ball on 
the floor," says Bzdelik. "When they press, everyone has to. It's very 
difficult. And then, if you beat it by taking the ball right at them, there is 
Ewing under the basket, ready to block a shot. You have to be pretty talented 
to score on him. Having him back there allows the Knicks to gamble and trap you 
hard, because they know he's always there." 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick is our go-to guy," says guard Mark Jackson, a former St. John's player 
who used to play against Ewing in Big East wars. "Everyone understands that. 
He's our leader. Without him, we go nowhere."

PAYTON'S PLACE IS ON THE BASKETBALL COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There is a fire in Gary Payton's game that any basketball coach would love. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to keep the blaze burning, but not out of control. 
</P>
<P>
"You just want to bring him back to reality," Payton's crusty old coach, Ralph 
Miller, said. "He'll take on anything. But this is what makes him a player. 
This is what makes him a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"With someone like Gary, you don't want to put your foot on his neck and take 
away the basic instincts that make him a player. But you're working all the 
time to keep it under control." 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon State coach turns 70 next month. He's about to end a 38-year career 
as a major-college coach. 
</P>
<P>
And when he sees Payton on the court, he sees someone with the passion and 
skill for the game that the coach hasn't seen often in his four decades of 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"He loves to win," Miller said. "Now I don't think that develops. I think he 
had that from the very start. It's the same with his hand-eye coordination and 
passing. No coach did that for him." 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-foot-3 junior gives Miller much of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
"He's given me my whole game, defense and offense. He's molded me into a player 
I don't think I ever could have been if I had gone to St. John's or wherever," 
Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten along with him since day one," he said of his coach. "I don't know 
what it was. Maybe it was because I worked hard. He saw that I was going to 
work and he probably saw something in me." 
</P>
<P>
In his third season, Payton is tearing up the Pacific 10 Conference. When only 
conference games are considered, he's the league leader in scoring at 22 points 
per game, assists at eight per game, and steals at 3.2 per game. 
</P>
<P>
He's led a team that has virtually no inside game to a 19-5 record and a 
probable berth in the NCAA tournament. He's already broken the school record 
for assists and steals and is on course to easily surpass the NCAA assist mark 
if he plays next season. 
</P>
<P>
He was Pac-10 freshman of the year in 1987 and was the conference defensive 
player of the year in each of his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although he admits he's thinking about leaving college a year early to enter 
the NBA, Payton says he'll probably be back with the Beavers next season. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind, I want to come back. There are a lot of guards coming out in my 
spot. They've got national recognition. People are saying if I come back next 
year, I could be first-team this or first-team that, that I could go higher in 
the draft and things like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also wants to get his degree, something he's wanted to do since his older 
brother, Greg, went to the University of San Francisco and dropped out after 1 
1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his staff recruited Payton when others backed off because of his 
reputation as a hot head. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been kicked out of seven (high school) ball games, what else are 
you're going to think?" Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was a very good leader but he was an ornery little dickens," the 
coach said. "There were a lot of reasons not to want him, except his ability. 
The problem was could you control him?" 
</P>
<P>
Payton knew all about his reputation. He said his whole team at Skyline High 
School in Oakland, Calif., had a hot temper. 
</P>
<P>
"I played with Greg Foster. He was the kind of person who was hot-tempered, 
too. All our team was hyper," Payton said. 
</P>
<P>
While others backed off, Oregon State remained interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the coach and them saw that I was a competitor and the only reason 
(the temper tantrums) happened is because I wanted to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Payton was ready to say no to the Beavers and go to St. John's, but the 
Redmen backed off at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody makes mistakes," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Angry at the rejection and worried about moving so far from home, Payton 
decided to go to Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he's started all 82 games. From the beginning, he was the team's 
leader who thrived in the face of unfriendly crowds. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, his cocky on-court attitude drew jeers from the opposing 
student sections, a trait that has been amplified in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
The catcalls are music to Miller's ears. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy if they go pick on Gary," he said, "because it does bring him 
to attention, let us say, and he responds well." 
</P>
<P>
Payton agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I think since my freshman year I've calmed down extremely, but you know you 
can't take all that away from me because I'm a competitor. That's one of my 
strengths. I get mad when things aren't going right. I just have that glare. It 
movitates the team like that. When they see me get upset and start to play 
hard, they start to play hard, too." 
</P>
<P>
In his first two seasons, Payton's big weakness was his outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, he said, he took 500 jump shots a day, using drills developed by 
Freddy Boyd, a former NBA guard and one of Miller's assistants. As a result, 
he's one of the leaders Pac-10 leaders in 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
But above everything else, he's still a defender. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense is the best thing about me, I think," he said. "I can make more happen 
on defense than I can on offense." 
</P>
<P>
His strategy, he said, is to look as if he's not paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Act like you're not doing anything and people get lackadaisical and forget 
about you," Payton said,"then there you are with a steal and, boom, you're 
gone."

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN KEEPS ITS COMPOSURE IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY NISTA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whittier Christian High School remained cool during a few heated moments Friday 
and relied on the hot shooting of Scott Ferguson to beat El Segundo, 71-57, and 
advance to the Southern Section 2-AA final. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian will play Banning for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who was double-teamed and pushed around inside, scored 20 points and 
grabbed 10 rebounds to lead the Heralds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting them to double-team me to get me frustrated," said Ferguson, a 
6-foot-7 center. "Coach told me just to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they would be glued to me. I didn't expect to score a lot. I thought 
the perimeter shooters would have the big nights." 
</P>
<P>
But the Heralds' transition game was working, meaning the ball found its way 
inside to Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
It also meant a physical game that resulted in El Segundo being awarded three 
technicals and losing one player, Shawn Foster, who was ejected after he was 
called for one of the technicals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expecting that," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "I knew they 
would be physical on the boards. But I was surprised at how physical it got in 
some of the other areas." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo Coach Rick Sabosky received two technicals, the second for walking 
on the court to request a timeout after two players collided on the way to the 
basket and remained on the floor. No one was injured on the play. 
</P>
<P>
But by that point in the third quarter, Whittier Christian had built a 30-point 
lead thanks, in part, to forward Paul McKinley, who sank five of five free 
throws in the third quarter on the way to 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
But El Segundo went on a 17-4 run to close out the quarter and pull within 
57-38. 
</P>
<P>
"Give them credit," Brown said. "They started taking advantage when we slowed 
down. They made a run at us. But ultimately it didn't make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles threatened early in the first quarter, opening a 7-2 lead, but the 
Heralds picked up the tempo and went on a 24-1 run throughout the rest of the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds' dominance continued into the second quarter and was on a 34-5 run 
before El Segundo managed seven of the final nine points to make the score 
38-19 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"We got the fast break going. We got the ball pushed up the floor and scored 
well out of that," Brown said.

TRABUCO HILLS MAKES QUICK WORK OF SAN LUIS OBISPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Luis Obispo High School started slowly and was finished off quickly by 
Trabuco Hills Friday night as the Mustangs won, 65-52, in a 3-A boys' semifinal 
basketball game in front of about 600 spectators at El Toro High School. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (21-6) will play Corona del Mar, a 57-56 overtime winner against 
Morningside, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo (18-7) was never in Friday's game. The Tigers came out sluggish 
and cold and were unable to match up with Trabuco Hills' speed or its 6-foot-10 
center, Rick Swanwick. 
</P>
<P>
"He would give any team trouble whose biggest guy is 6-3," San Luis Obispo 
Coach Gary Etheredge said. The Tigers' tallest player is 6-3 Kevin Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers tried to double and triple team Swanwick, but the Trabuco Hills 
center passed like a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all the Mustangs ran a clinic on how to hit the open man as they 
compiled 18 assists, four by Swanwick. With Swanwick covered, his teammates 
were not gun shy as they consistently buried open shots. 
</P>
<P>
Three players scored in double figures and a fourth, Tim Manning, had nine 
points. Swanwick led the way with 17 points, nine rebounds and seven blocked 
shots. John Goodman had 16 points, and Randy Kriech added 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Every good team, I feel, has to start the game around the basket and work out 
and (tonight) was a classic example of our doing that," Mustang Coach Rainer 
Wulf said of his team's passing game. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills jumped out to a 12-0 lead, holding San Luis Obispo scoreless the 
first 5 minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew they weren't a good three-point shooting team so we didn't guard them 
out at the three-point line," Wulf said. "We didn't overextend." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers turned the ball over nine times in the first half and could not put 
the ball in the basket. They connected on 8 of 25 shots (32%) while the 
Mustangs hit 60% from the field (15 of 25) in the first half. Trabuco Hills 
led, 39-24, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"The first half was our undoing," Etheredge said. The Tigers had a long bus 
ride down and were playing their first playoff game on the road, factors Wulf 
thinks took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they thought it was going to be the same," Wulf said. "You get into that 
comfort zone (at home). They seemed really tentative from the start." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills led by as many as 20 points, 54-34, late in the third quarter 
before the Tigers made a run -- well, more like a jog. They cut the lead to 13 
at 65-52 on the strength of two Steve McCallum three-pointers with a little 
more than a minute to play. McCallum led the Tigers with 23 points.

CORONA DEL MAR TAKES IT TO THE BANK WITH FREE THROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing like banking a free throw to take some of the pressure off when 
you're trying to win a game in the final seconds of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Weston Johnson, Corona del Mar High School reserve guard, provided the light 
moment with 22 seconds remaining and then got serious a few seconds later by 
making another free throw that gave Corona del Mar a 57-56 victory over 
Morningside in the Southern Section 3-A division boys' basketball semifinals 
Friday night in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having a nervous breakdown, but even if you win by banking a shot, it's 
OK," Johnson said. "Their crowd was yelling stuff at me, but when I banked in 
the free throw, it sort of relaxed me. I knew I was OK after that." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's aim certainaly improved. He swished a free throw with 3 seconds 
remaining in the extra 3-minute period to move unseeded and unranked Corona del 
Mar (19-9) into the championship game, where the Sea Kings will meet Trabuco 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson figured he had attempted all of five free throws all season, but he 
made three of four attempts in overtime as Corona del Mar scored yet another 
playoff upset. Corona del Mar, which finished third in the Sea View League, has 
surprised El Dorado, Rolling Hills and now Morningside to reach the finals. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared that mediocre free-throw shooting was going to be Corona del Mar's 
downfall. The Sea Kings had struggled to make 26 of 40 attempts going into 
overtime, but they found the mark and made five of six attempts down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Morningside (23-5) played a big part in the unlikely victory. The 
Monarchs committed 30 fouls and had three players foul out. The biggest blunder 
of the game came with 3 seconds remaining in overtime, when Morningside's Ken 
Jones was caught reaching in on Johnson in the Sea Kings' backcourt with the 
score tied, 56-56. 
</P>
<P>
"Our scouting report and the comments I got from everyone I talked to said that 
you're never out of the game . . . they'll help you all they can in a 
ballgame," said Paul Orris, Corona del Mar coach. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, seeded fourth, was more than helpful twice during the game. The 
Monarchs went 4 minutes without scoring in the third quarter and saw a 36-26 
lead disappear. Corona del Mar center Brian Spratt scored eight of his 
game-high 21 points in the quarter as the Sea Kings opened a 38-36 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside still looked like a winner with less than 2 minutes remaining and 
holding a 49-45 lead. But Corona del Mar's Jeff Jackson made a free throw and 
then teammate Matt Cwiertnia stole a pass, scored, was fouled and added a free 
throw to tie the score, 49-49. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's twin brother, Warren, had an opportunity to win the game with 9 
seconds remaining in regulation play. Warren went to the foul line with his 
team trailing, 50-49, but made only one free throw, leaving the heroics to 
brother Weston. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Orris reflected upon his team's remarkable run through the playoffs 
to next week's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't think this team is anywhere near the most talented team we've 
had at Corona del Mar," Orris said. "But they play together well, and they 
never give up. We got a little more confidence as we went along tonight and 
finally made some free throws when it counted most."

CAPISTRANO VALLEY SLOWS PACE, THEN RUNS OFF WITH 84-71 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Capistrano Valley High School won a battle of fast breaks with Buena in the 
Southern Section 5-A boys' basketball semifinals Friday night, not by speeding 
up but by slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Capistrano Valley was out of sync trying to keep up with Buena's 
hectic running game. Only when the Cougars slowed down a few RPMs and seized 
control of the pace were they able to play effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley even managed to run a more efficient fast break in defeating 
Buena, 84-71, at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (23-4) got an impressive second-half performance by forward Scott 
McCorkle, who had a game-high 32 points and 12 rebounds. Capistrano Valley also 
made 13 of 16 free throws in the fourth quarter to thwart any chance Buena had 
of rallying. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley advances to the 5-A championship game, where it will meet the 
winner of tonight's Irvine-Pasadena game. It marks the Cougars' second 
consecutive championship appearance. Last season, they fell to Simi Valley in 
the 4-A final. Buena finished its season 21-5. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the first quarter, it appeared as if Capistrano Valley's hopes for 
a title berth would be run over by Buena's running and gunning. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs made five three-pointers in the first quarter and ran the Cougars' 
man-to-man defense silly. Capistrano Valley also looked shaky against Buena's 
full-court press, turning the ball over six times in the quarter. Things looked 
even worse when McCorkle missed his first three shots and point guard Chris 
Kostoff tossed up a free throw that hit nothing but air. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 thing was that we didn't panic when they made that run," Capistrano 
Valley Coach Mark Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Capistrano Valley trailed, 19-8, after yet another three-pointer, this 
one by reserve David Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cougars finally found the right gear and went on a 8-0 run to end the 
first quarter down 19-16. 
</P>
<P>
When McCorkle scored on a move inside with 4:11 left in the half, Capistrano 
Valley took the lead for the first time and never relinquished it. The Cougars 
maintained a two- to five-point lead until late in the game when Buena was 
forced to foul in order to get the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
But Capistrano Valley made its free throws down the stretch and suddenly Buena, 
which appeared worn out by its own early pace, began missing three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Jeff Oliver, who led Buena with 17 points including five three-pointers, 
went scoreless in the fourth quarter as Capistrano Valley pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle had 12 in the fourth quarter, including a run of six in a row to start 
the period. He finished off the scoring with a two-handed monster dunk in the 
final seconds that set off a celebration among the Capistrano Valley fans. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we were a little lax (early in the game)," McCorkle said. "We didn't 
come out as strong as we should have. We played their game with all that 
running." 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff bounced back from his air ball at the free throw line to add 21 points, 
including three three-pointers. Nick Kost, a reserve guard, played a steady 
game and added 11 for the Cougars.

MISSION VIEJO PICKS OFF CERRITOS EARLY, OFTEN 
</P>

The Mission Viejo High School boys' soccer team defeated Cerritos, 7-1, in a 
Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal match Friday at Mission Viejo, but coaches of 
both teams said it was over by the time the score was 2-0 early in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
"When the second goal hit them, they knew they were in trouble," Mission Viejo 
Coach Cal Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos Coach Ron Flores agreed: "Oh yeah, it fell apart after the second and 
third goals. I just started looking at my watch, hoping the time would pass." 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos (24-3), who will play St. Francis in Tuesday's semifinals, led, 
1-0, at halftime on senior forward Jim Eddow's breakaway goal with 4 minutes 
remaining in the half. Eddow was rewarded by being taken out of the game in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We put in two faster forwards at the half (Jeff Jurgemeyer and Mark Gaw) 
because we knew we could get outside because we were faster," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
The move to speed paid quick dividends for Mission Viejo as Gaw scored from 
point-blank range just 4 minutes into the second half after he gained control 
of Andy Wortrich's blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, center Joe-Max Moore scored the first of his two goals on a 
35-footer to put Mission Viejo ahead, 3-0. Moore also scored 31 minutes into 
the second half when he split two defenders to the right of the goal and 
left-footed a cross shot from 15 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
Wortrich, Todd Patrick and Steve Vanderweide also scored for Mission Viejo. 
Eddie Soto scored Cerritos' goal.

KENNEDY PITCHER WITH 1 KIDNEY GIVEN DISTRICT APPROVAL TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROCKY PINHEIRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cody Beaumaster, the Kennedy High sophomore who created a flap after disclosing 
during a routine athletics physical that he had only one kidney, will be 
permitted to play baseball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Beaumaster and his father Robert signed a release form Friday with the L. A. 
Unified School District that will allow the 6-foot, 165-pound right-hander to 
compete at the varsity level for the Golden Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
The Beaumasters had met earlier with Dr. Sonia Andonian, the district 
physician, who noted the possible life-threatening situations the 15-year-old 
might be facing. 
</P>
<P>
A school nurse also referred to an American Medical Assn. guideline, which high 
schools generally follow, that an athlete should not be allowed to compete in 
contact or semi-contact sports if the athlete has a questionable medical 
history. The school felt that Beaumaster, who lost his left kidney 10 years 
ago, fell into that category. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the implications of Cody playing," Robert Beaumaster said. "We 
signed two releases that exempt L. A. Unified from all responsibility should 
something happen to Cody." 
</P>
<P>
One of the releases states that the school district will not be held 
responsible for any injury to the kidney. The other ensures that the 
Beaumasters will not sue the district should the pitcher suffer an injury to 
the remaining kidney while competing for Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"After consulting with Cody's urologist (Dr. Dudley Danoff), the district 
officials decided to allow Cody to play, provided we sign the waivers," the 
elder Beaumaster said. 
</P>
<P>
Danoff, a physician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, provided a statement saying 
that he had examined Beaumaster and felt the youngster would be in no danger 
while playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is great," an excited Cody Beaumaster said. "I was worried about 
everything happening wrong before the meeting with Dr. Andonian, but things 
turned out just perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Beaumaster said that he received a lot of support from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was behind me and now that the whole thing is settled I can do what I 
should have been doing for the past week . . . playing baseball."

Caltrans' division of aeronautics has established guidelines to control the 
amount of noise generated over residential areas by aircraft using the state's 
airports. Under those guidelines, any area exposed to an average Community 
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) of more than 65 in a year is considered to be 
noise-impacted. 
</P>
<P>
To comply with those regulations, John Wayne Airport has set up nine stations 
at locations in Newport Beach, Santa Ana and Tustin to monitor noise levels. 
Some stations are on private property and others on public land, at the 
following locations: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONITOR STATIONS 
</P>
<P>
M-1: 2139 Anniversary Lane, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-2: 1907 Tradewinds Lane, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-3: 2601 Vista del Oro, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-4: 1352 Reynold Ave., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-5: 17952 Beneta Way, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
M-6: No longer in use 
</P>
<P>
M-7: 20181 S.W. Birch St., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-8: 1131 Back Bay Drive, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-9: 1300 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-10: Golf Course, 3100 Irvine Ave., Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The stations monitor the noise levels on a daily basis. The average daily 
levels, which are also averaged for each month, are "the result of a computer 
analysis based on county-provided data including flight tracks, actual traffic 
</P>
<P>
counts, average SENELs (Single Event Noise Exposure Levels) by aircraft model 
and recorded CNEL values for each monitor station," according to the quarterly 
report from the airport's Noise Abatement Office.

As of the end of September, a total of 50 homes in Newport Beach and Santa Ana 
Heights are in a noise-impacted area. The state has several remedies for 
property owners in the area: the homes can be insulated, they can be purchased 
by the county, or the sites can be rezoned for "other non-noise sensitive 
uses," 
</P>
<P>
according to Lynn Dosheery, a county planner who serves as the Santa Ana 
Heights project manager. For instance, the zoning in the area along Acacia and 
Birch streets in Santa Ana Heights has been changed from a general agricultural 
use to a business park, she said.

The airport's Noise Abatement Office logs noise complaints from local citizens. 
During the third quarter of 1988, the office received a total of 1,322 noise 
complaints from local citizens, a 103% increase from the number of complaints 
received the previous quarter. The increase can be traced to the fact that in 
the summer months, "windows are open, people are outside, and are just 
generally more sensitive to noise," said airport spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Balboa residents had been publicly promoting noise complaints as a part 
of their unsuccessful effort to have jet liners rerouted so that departures 
occur as much over Tustin as they do over Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Flights generally depart southbound over Upper Newport Bay, except when air 
traffic controllers reverse the pattern due to wind conditions. According to 
Assistant Airport Manager Jan Mittermeier, there was no significant change in 
the number of departures over Newport Beach.

The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health 
Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical 
spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to 
the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through 
mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in 
Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is HAZMAT's

Description: One of 23 wilderness areas established by the California 
Wilderness Act of 1984, San Mateo Canyon is a relatively untouched wilderness 
of steep canyon country sculpted by seasonal streams. Elevations range from 500 
to 3,000 feet. The vegetation is primarily mixed chaparral with occasional oak 
woodlands; sycamore and alder interspersed with oaks and ferns can be found in 
some canyon bottoms. 
</P>
<P>
Location: The 39,540-acre wilderness is in the southern portion of the Trabuco 
Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest, and includes portions of 
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Entry: The nearest entry point to Orange County is at Bear Canyon, off the 
Ortega Highway just past Upper San Juan Campround (see map). There is a parking 
lot there, with signs pointing to local trails. 
</P>
<P>
Activities: Mechanized vehicles (including bicycles) are not allowed within the 
wilderness area. Hiking and horseback riding are allowed on an extensive trail 
system in the wilderness, and remote camping is permitted with certain 
restrictions (camping is not allowed within 100 feet of streams, springs and 
meadows). Hunting is allowed with a valid license, but target shooting is not 
permitted. 
</P>
<P>
Wilderness permits: Entry permits are required for overnight trips into the 
wilderness. The permit is free and can be obtained at the Trabuco Ranger 
District Headquarters in Corona or at any of the Forest Service Fire Stations 
throughout the district. Permits can also be obtained by mail or by phone at 
(714) 736-1811. Day use of the wilderness does not require a permit. 
</P>
<P>
Regulations: A list of camping and other regulations is available from the 
Forest Service through the number listed above.

2 ELDERLY MEN INJURED AS CAR HITS THEIR GOLF CART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH T. YAMADA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driving an electric golf cart, 81-year-old Ford S. Barton picked up his 
83-year-old friend to go to a nearby supermarket in Laguna Hills. To get there, 
Barton used the same streets he had used for the past 4 years. But this time he 
never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Barton's cart was rear-ended by a 1983 Buick Regal on Thursday. The cart flew 
into a center divider and hit an olive tree. The two men were thrown from the 
cart and suffered concussions and cuts. The driver of the car was not cited, 
and an investigation is continuing, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Leisure World retirement community in Laguna Hills, where both men live, 
about 800 golf carts are registered. Residents use the carts to drive on public 
roads, often illegally, to run errands in nearby neighborhoods. Although 
statistics involving such accidents aren't kept, CHP Officer Tina Brown said 
she knows of at least four accidents involving the carts in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Golf cart drivers "usually get hit because they are slow," Brown said. "It's 
usually older people driving them. They seem more prone to accidents." 
</P>
<P>
To be licensed to drive on public streets, golf carts must have seat belts, 
headlights and license plates. Even with licenses, the carts, which have a top 
speed of 15 m.p.h., can only be driven on roads with a speed limit of 25 m.p.h. 
or less under the California Vehicle Code. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP rarely cites golf cart drivers but issues warnings instead, Officer Ken 
Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an informational thing," he said. "Many of the drivers don't know what 
the rules are." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Daily stopped a woman in a golf cart on a street where the speed 
limit was more than 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to sit down and plot out all the little streets she had to take," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton's unlicensed golf cart was hit on El Toro Road, which has a 40 m.p.h. 
speed limit, about 11:45 a.m. The cart did not have seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said Friday that he was driving carefully before he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked back to see if the road was clear, and no cars were coming," he said. 
"I waited until I was sure." 
</P>
<P>
He turned left and heard tires screeching. That's all he remembers, he said, 
until he "woke up and saw a paramedic's face." 
</P>
<P>
He was in good condition Friday, with 30 stitches in his head, at Mission 
Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. His friend, Charles A. 
Dawes, was in fair condition at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said he has driven the cart on public streets for 10 years. Before that, 
he drove on only private roads to a nearby supermarket. But when the market 
closed, he had to change his route to get to another supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Police have never stopped him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had Highway Patrol cars pass me," he said. "I assumed it was all right." 
</P>
<P>
At Leisure World, security director Dan Woodward said he sees two or three 
people a day using golf carts to drive on public streets. But because there are 
14 gates at Leisure World, he could not estimate how many of its 22,000 
residents use the golf carts outside the grounds. He said he knows of none 
licensed to travel on public roads. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP, which patrols the Laguna Hills area, "never gets any complaints" about 
golf carts on public streets, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said he isn't thinking about changing routes. "It's the only way to get 
there."

'STU FINE FIELD' TO BE DEDICATED TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newport-Mesa Unified School District officials today will formally name the 
varsity baseball playing area at Newport Harbor High School for Stuart W. Fine, 
a parent and longtime volunteer umpire who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
Noon ceremonies at the school will designate the baseball area as "Stu Fine 
Field." Fine, a Newport Beach real estate broker and former teacher, died Jan. 
24, 1988, of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Fine, a former varsity baseball player for Pepperdine University, spent much of 
his spare time as a volunteer coach and umpire for the Newport National Little 
League, the Boys Club of the Harbor Area and Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Pepperdine in 1959, Fine was a junior high teacher in 
Bishop and Tustin. He entered the real estate business in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Fine's wife, Esther, said she is pleased and proud that her husband's memory is 
being honored by the high school. "This would have meant so much to him," she 
said. "Baseball and youth were his loves."

40 EVACUATED AFTER SPILL IN UCI SCIENCE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 people in the UC Irvine Physical Sciences Building were evacuated 
Friday night when about 4 liters of a hazardous material, cyclopentadiene, was 
spilled in a fifth-floor stock room. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, although two students complained of dizziness and 
were taken to the Student Health Center as a precaution, said Linda Granell, 
UCI director of public information. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 fire safety personnel, including two hazardous-materials teams, were 
called to the campus at 7:54 p.m., Orange County Fire Department spokesman Dan 
Southworth said. 
</P>
<P>
The teams cleaned up the material, which has a strong, perfume-like odor and is 
harmful when inhaled in large amounts, Granell said.

COUNTY WITHHOLDS FUNDS FOR AIRPORT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a rare move, Orange County officials have withheld $111,000 in payments due 
the prime contractor on the new, $48-million John Wayne Airport passenger 
terminal because of a dispute between the firm and a subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said, however, that withholding some payments on the already 
beleaguered project is not expected to delay its April 1, 1990, opening date. 
</P>
<P>
The money involved in the dispute involves construction problems that arose 
months ago and are already being corrected, officials explained. They also said 
that, under state law, they had no choice but to withhold the money. 
</P>
<P>
"Withholding funds from a prime contractor happens once a year, if that," said 
Charles Niederman, director of facilities, property and transportation for the 
county General Services Administration. "Generally our contractors have very 
good relations with the people who work for them." 
</P>
<P>
County officials took the unusual step of withholding money a week ago Friday, 
project supervisors said, after a subcontractor, Structural Beton Inc. of 
Rancho Palos Verdes, filed a formal stop payment notice with the county to halt 
disbursement of funds to the prime contractor, Taylor Woodrow California Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Shahnazarian, president of Structural Beton, is the same subcontractor who 
last week accused Taylor Woodrow of violating state law by hiring 
subcontractors for major work that Taylor Woodrow was obligated to do itself. 
Taylor Woodrow has declined to comment on the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the county Board of Supervisors, Shahnazarian said that Taylor 
Woodrow's hiring of his own firm was proof of such violations and that he knew 
of other examples as well. But county officials said their decision to withhold 
funds had nothing to do with that issue, which is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the law involving stop notices, we have to withhold funds whether we 
agree with it or not," said Richard Begley, airport expansion project manager. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the county withheld more than $1 million from the airport terminal's 
architects in a dispute about cost overruns and alleged design mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Also, subcontractors recently threatened to walk off the job because of slow 
payments from the county to Taylor Woodrow and hence the subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Shahnazarian's dispute is more complicated. He says that Taylor Woodrow has 
reneged on a severance agreement in which he was supposed to receive $111,000 
after completing a third of the work on the terminal's concrete foundation. 
Taylor Woodrow officials, however, say Shahnazarian's firm failed to install 
certain anchor bolts properly in the foundation, resulting in fixes that are 
expected to total $200,000. Shahnazarian has strongly denied any wrongdoing on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Elliott, Taylor Woodrow's project chief, said he expects his firm to 
secure bonding for the disputed $111,000, a move that would allow the county to 
release funds to his company. 
</P>
<P>
County officials last week deducted the disputed $111,000 from a payment of 
more than $1 million to Taylor Woodrow for work completed as of Dec. 31. "We 
tore up one check and wrote another after deducting the $111,000," said Begley.

GATES FOE SAYS GUN PERMITS WENT TO CONTRIBUTORS 
</P>

<P>
A private investigator who is suing Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates took the 
witness stand Friday and charged that Gates used permits to carry concealed 
weapons as rewards for his election campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Private investigator Preston Guillory testified that he had been given access 
to Gates' gun-permit files by court order and that he found that concealed 
weapons permits had been issued to 101 people who had given Gates a total of 
$121,000 in campaign contributions. Guillory's attorneys said the files covered 
the years from 1979 until about 1985. 
</P>
<P>
He said the files showed that Gates had approved every permit application made 
by a campaign contributor and that every contributor had used the same 
justification: "Carrying large sums of cash." 
</P>
<P>
Guillory is seeking $5 million from Gates and Anaheim officials, alleging that 
their investigations of him on suspicion of impersonating a law officer and 
illegally carrying a concealed weapon were politically motivated. Guillory was 
acquitted of the charges in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyers have been trying to show that Gates used his intelligence 
investigators to spy on and harass his critics and political opponents. In a 
previous case involving three of Gates' election opponents, the county paid a 
$375,000 out-of-court settlement on Gates' behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory alleges that he became a target for such harassment after he sued 
Gates for a concealed weapon permit. 
</P>
<P>
He testified Friday that after Gates denied his application for a permit in 
1977, he sued the sheriff in Superior Court, alleging that Gates was biased 
against private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory said the court ordered Gates not to discriminate against private 
investigators and instructed Guillory to reapply. When Gates again denied him a 
permit, Guillory sued in federal court. That suit is still awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Guillory testified that at the time Gates was denying concealed weapon permits 
to most private investigators, he granted permits to 140 people with criminal 
records, to 10 people who live outside Orange County or California, and to 52 
people for "political considerations."

FARWEST SAVINGS PRESIDENT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The president of FarWest Savings &amp; Loan has been fired for unspecified 
reasons, and his chief financial officer has been dismissed for making 
unauthorized investments, the attorney for the thrift's parent company said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
President Victor H. Indiek and Chief Financial Officer Robert D. Struck were 
terminated Tuesday, said Kurt C. Kemper, general counsel for FarWest Financial 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Operation of the Newport Beach-based S&amp;L was turned over, at least 
temporarily, to Charles H. Green, chief financial officer of FarWest Financial. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Struck was terminated for engaging in unauthorized investments," Kemper 
said. "We have no reason to believe, however, that there is any loss as a 
result of his actions." 
</P>
<P>
He said Struck had moved about $85 million from government securities into 
certificates of deposit at three large S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"Every bank and S&amp;L has strict policies about investing depositor funds, 
and he violated those policies," Kemper said. 
</P>
<P>
Struck declined to comment on the advice of his lawyer, Fred T. Ashley, who 
also refused to comment. Indiek could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Kemper would not comment on the reason for Indiek's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Indiek was dismissed because he was held accountable for 
Struck's action. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for FarWest and Indiek are negotiating a settlement of Indiek's 
multi-year contract, Kemper said. 
</P>
<P>
Indiek, who was hired in August, had been one of the chief financial officers 
and one of six senior executive vice presidents at Financial Corp. of America, 
the now-bankrupt Irvine firm that once owned American Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the reins at FarWest Savings, Indiek hired some of his colleagues 
from FCA/American, including Struck, who had left FCA in 1987.

RETAIL DEVELOPERS LOOK AHEAD TO GROWTH OF STATE'S POPULATION, BUT ASBESTOS 
LOOMS AS POTENTIAL THREAT TO PROSPERITY FOR SOME; 
</P>
<P>
FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT FOR MALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the shopping center industry, the good news is that California will need 
lots more malls. And those hunting for low-interest loans probably will be able 
to find them -- although not anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is, if you happen to own a building with asbestos, it could cost a 
fortune to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
Those were some of the predictions -- and concerns -- voiced Friday when more 
than 1,200 retail developers, tenants and lenders attended an "idea exchange" 
of the International Council of Shopping Centers. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the outlook was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect interest rates will be a lot lower. The question is when and how high 
they're going to go before they get there," Jeremiah W. O'Connor, Jr., council 
president and head of New York's J.W. O'Connor &amp; Co. Inc., told the group. 
"At some point, the economy is going to turn down. When it does, interest rates 
will too." 
</P>
<P>
For those with the financing, California will be an ideal place to build 
shopping centers, several panelists predicted. That's because over the next 12 
years the state's growing population will need an estimated 3 million new 
housing units -- a good number of them in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's 400 to 500 more shopping centers," said Ranney Draper, a general 
partner with Costa Mesa-based Diversified Shopping Centers. 
</P>
<P>
Another plus for developers here is the projected growth in the numbers of 
ethnic shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, the nation's 22 million Latinos have purchasing power of $140 
billion a year, said Stephen Levin, vice president and general manager of KVEA, 
Channel 52, a Spanish language TV station. And by 2015, there will be an 
estimated 40 million Latinos in this country. 
</P>
<P>
That translates to retail opportunity, the panelists agreed, for downtown areas 
such as Santa Ana's 4th and Main Street district, as well as for smaller 
neighborhood stores and for malls. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexican customer is good for grocery stores. They buy a lot more produce," 
said Pat Barber, vice president with the Boys Markets. 
</P>
<P>
At the Boys chain's Viva stores, which are aimed toward Latinos, customers buy 
twice as much produce as shoppers in the company's conventional supermarkets, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a terrific opportunity for us and anybody . . . because there are that 
many more (ethnic) shoppers out there," Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
When the subject turned to asbestos, there was much less to cheer about. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, it cost 25 cents per square foot to insulate buildings with 
the fire retardant, panelists said. Today, it costs an average of $25 a square 
foot to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
And even with unlimited funds, "there aren't enough companies in the U.S. today 
that could adequately perform all the asbestos removal," said John Pentz, 
associate partner with Hughes Investments in Newport Beach. "And if they did, 
the asbestos in the air would be worse than it is today."

BAKER COMMUNICATIONS CLOSES COSTA MESA NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa News, a 25,000-circulation weekly, was closed Friday by its 
publisher, Baker Communications. 
</P>
<P>
The controlled-circulation paper, delivered free to area residents, was unable 
to generate enough advertising to cover publishing costs, Executive Editor 
Roger Bloom said. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, who headed the Costa Mesa News for 2 years and formerly was editor of 
the Huntington Beach Independent, said he and advertising director Marcus Dietz 
-- the paper's only permanent staff members -- were told of the closure Friday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Publisher Seth Baker could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Baker Communications, headquartered in Los Angeles, also publishes the Newport 
Ensign weekly and the Newport (714) magazine in Orange County, the Palos Verde 
Peninsula News and Agoura Acorn weeklies, and the Beverly Hills (213) magazine 
in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Baker acquired the Newport Ensign, Costa Mesa News and Irvine News Today from 
Coast Media Group of Culver City in 1985. The Irvine paper, which then had a 
circulation of only 2,000, folded about 2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The three papers once were part of a thriving publishing group operated by 
Pennysaver publishing magnate Herbert Sutton, who poured hundreds of thousands 
into the weeklies -- introducing color photography and a number of 
typographical innovations and winning several publishing industry awards. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Media bought the weeklies in 1981, and by mid-1982 the papers were caught 
in the recession that depressed advertising revenues. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Baker acquired the Newport Ensign, Costa Mesa News and Irvine News 
Today in 1985, the papers had a combined staff of about 10 -- down from 50 when 
Sutton owned them. 
</P>
<P>
The surviving Newport Ensign has two writers, two photographers, a part-time 
sports editor and "three or four" advertising people, Bloom said.

RIGHTIST GADFLY DOWNEY BRINGS ACT TO ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESS BRAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People who find "The Morton Downey Jr. Show" too refined for their tastes are 
in for a treat: Tonight, the pugnacious TV personality brings his act to 
Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre, and he promises patrons a show that is longer, 
louder and more profane than the broadcast version. 
</P>
<P>
He'll even sing. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of Downey's late father, the Irish singing star of the 1930s and '40s, 
might be disappointed by that part of the show, however. 
</P>
<P>
"My father would roll over in his grave," Downey said. "He sang beautiful 
ballads, and there ain't no beautiful ballads in my repertoire." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling," Downey plans to sing such personal 
favorites as "Mr. Drug Dealer," "A Lawyer Named Sue" and a new number, "Zip 
It," which he noted "was inspired by a thing I say to guests." 
</P>
<P>
Downey's singing (the record, "Morton Downey Jr. Sings" is scheduled for 
release later this year) reflects a more complicated personality than casual 
viewers of his show might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Morton Downey Sr. and dancer Barbara Bennett, Downey recalled an 
angry childhood and a broken home; his mother left when he was 9, and though 
his father retained custody, Downey found himself shipped off to military 
school at age 10. 
</P>
<P>
Downey, now 56, said he never fit into the life planned for him by his 
celebrity parents, wealthy and influential people who counted the Kennedys 
among their friends. "I never went to the proms and debutante balls they wanted 
me to go to," he recalled from his New York office earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Downey said, "I took off when I was 17," beginning a lifelong odyssey 
that only recently brought him celebrity as a vulgar right-winger with a 
nationally syndicated TV show. 
</P>
<P>
He recounted his history with some imprecision: After his military service 
ended in 1954, the New York University dropout came to California to break into 
the music business. In the late 1950s and early '60s, he was "involved" in the 
production of two pop hits, "Wipeout" and "Pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his desire to head his own rock band, Downey was unable to make it as a 
singer and songwriter. Instead, with the help of a friend, he got a job as a 
disc jockey and went from doing late-night shows under the moniker of "Captain 
Midnight" to prominence in such radio markets as Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960s, Downey recalled, included stints as an ITT salesman and as a 
campaign aide to Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. Downey said he was with Kennedy in Los 
Angeles when the senator was assassinated in 1968; the depression following 
that event led him to compose a book of poetry, "Quiet Thoughts Make the 
Loudest Noise." 
</P>
<P>
Downey, who in a recent show proposed court-ordered emasculation for convicted 
rapists, acknowledged that his support of the liberal Kennedy might surprise 
some of his viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked what he stood for. I liked his (determination)," said Downey, using a 
metaphor of male anatomy. "I believe if Bobby were around today, he'd still 
make a good President." 
</P>
<P>
Downey himself, however, established greater ties to the nation's right-wing 
fringe. He ran for the presidential nomination of the American Independent 
Party in 1980 and in recent years has been linked with such figures as 
conspiracy theorist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. 
</P>
<P>
He said he became acquainted with LaRouche to "penetrate" his organization but 
nevertheless acknowledged reading from LaRouche publications on his programs. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that "this guy had tremendous intelligence" about world events, 
even as he called LaRouche, who recently was convicted of swindling senior 
citizens to pay for his political organization, "a completely dangerous Adolf 
Hitler type." 
</P>
<P>
Downey's claims go on and on; he said he smuggled refugees out of Nigeria 
during the Biafran war in 1969, helped found the now-defunct American 
Basketball Assn., sang in Las Vegas hotels and made money giving motivational 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"It was what I called 'Combat Conversation,' how to put someone on the 
defensive and then allow them to come forward with their own ideas," Downey 
said of his work in the human-potential movement. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Downey said, he even taught political science and poetry at 
the University of Notre Dame as a "lecturing professor," although school 
officials said they have no record of his presence on their faculty. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after his return to radio, however, that the 
poet/singer/songwriter/entrepreneur/adventurer/politician began the rise that 
would place him among such 1980s phenomena as Geraldo Rivera and Wally George. 
</P>
<P>
After another of his business ventures went broke, Downey said he answered a 
Florida radio station's want ad for a talk show host in 1982. As he developed 
his combative, self-righteous broadcast style, Downey was fired regularly by 
station management he offended -- only to be picked up in larger radio markets. 
</P>
<P>
Downey had made it as far as Chicago by 1987, when New Jersey's WWOR-TV signed 
him for his TV program. The show went into national syndication this season. It 
airs locally on KABC-TV Channel 7 at midnight on weeknights, although the 
channel announced plans Friday to drop the show because of sliding ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"The Morton Downey Jr. Show" has been roundly castigated by critics, who are 
offended by its preference for shouting matches over discussion and for 
encouraging emotional, ignorant outbursts from audience members instead of 
reasoned examination of issues. One writer, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic Ron 
Powers, called the program "the most horrifying show of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Downey enjoys inciting his rowdy, blue-collar audience with such topics 
as the North American Man-Boy Love Assn., a group that seeks to legalize 
pederasty, and a Delaware legislator's proposal to flog convicted drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent program ostensibly about the U.S. trade imbalance, Downey used 
his stage to denounce unnamed advocates of "one-world government" and engaged 
in heated, abusive argument with an audience member who asserted that 
Japanese-built cars are more reliable than domestic models. 
</P>
<P>
Downey asserted that he is promoting the public good through his show, which he 
said is "80% issues." 
</P>
<P>
His audience, he said, is unable to understand complicated topics presented in 
a more cerebral fashion, so he endeavors to make current events palatable. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm giving them information in a way they can accept," he said of his fans. 
"When someone is being fed medicine, they swallow it a lot easier if they coat 
it in sugar." 
</P>
<P>
Comparing himself to the urbane host of ABC-TV's "Nightline," which precedes 
his program in Los Angeles, Downey said, "Ted (Koppel) does what Downey does in 
a soft way." 
</P>
<P>
Downey, in fact, cast himself as a folk hero to his following, seeing them as 
poorly educated, frustrated people who are left out of the U.S. mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I a Jean-Paul Sartre existentialist? No. Am I a William F. Buckley 
philosophical left-winger? No," he said, parenthetically insisting that 
Buckley, considered to be a father of modern intellectual conservatism, is 
actually a leftist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Downey said: "I'm the guy who lives in a row house in Queens. I'm the 
woman who has to take food stamps to the store in order to feed her kids. I'm 
the guy who'd like to get off welfare but can't, because the system wants to 
keep him poor. I'm all of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Downey clearly enjoys his late-found notoriety, but he said he does not expect 
to remain a talk-show host forever (an attitude that, given Friday's action by 
KABC, may prove practical). 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Downey said, he would like to take on "a total, complete advocacy 
role. I want to pick out something like the homeless or child abuse" to rail 
about. 
</P>
<P>
Another presidential candidacy might be in the cards as well, although Downey 
said, "We don't need another loudmouth in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, Downey savors his prominence, quickly dismissing critics 
who decry his act as the epitome of "trash TV." 
</P>
<P>
He warned: "They should remember that behind every house is a trash bag, and in 
that bag is trash, and that trash represents a piece of people's lives. Are you 
just going to denounce that trash, to say that a piece of life is unimportant?" 
</P>
<P>
And if that rhetorical metaphor isn't enough to assuage critics, Downey added 
that his show "is no trashier than 'Leave It to Beaver' was." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton Downey Jr. appears tonight at 7 at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. 
Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $19 to $26.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.

SOME OF THE NEVILLE BROTHERS' FAMOUS FANS ARE HELPING THE NEW ORLEANS BAND GET 
A TASTE OF SUCCESS AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the 13 years they've been together as a band, New Orleans' Neville Brothers 
have been perhaps the greatest anomaly in the music biz. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Art, Aaron, Charles and Cyril are some of the most respected musicians 
around, counting the Rolling Stones, Huey Lewis, Robert Palmer, Robert Plant, 
Herbie Hancock, Elvis Costello, a slew of critics and even "60 Minutes" 
co-anchor Ed Bradley among their fans. But to the public at large, the Nevilles 
have also remained some of the most unknown musicians extant, lacking radio 
play, or even a record contract for much of their career. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the band's mix of R&amp;B, funk, jazz, reggae and African music 
has any trouble moving masses of people when they get a chance to hear it: The 
Nevilles annually get crowds of 50,000 dancing during their customary closing 
spot at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and they were no less 
propulsive on the road with 1987's Amnesty International "Conspiracy of Hope" 
tour, sharing the stage with U2, Sting and Peter Gabriel. (The Nevilles will 
play the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano today.) 
</P>
<P>
"It is kind of frustrating," saxophonist/percussionist Charles Neville 
explained from a tour stop in Santa Barbara this week. "Because what we do is 
different, it's been a problem for radio programmers and record companies to 
figure out how to categorize us. . . . I think they may figure out that for 
what we are and what we do it's cool to play us and let the fans figure out 
what to call it." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the band's famous fans are working to make sure that the Nevilles' 
time has come. Daniel Lanois, producer of U2's Grammy-winning "The Joshua Tree" 
and discs by Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson, made a special project of 
helming the group's new album. Due out March 15, "Yellow Moon" is already being 
vigorously promoted by A&amp;M Records. Jonathan Demme ("Married to the Mob," 
"Stop Making Sense") directed the video to the debut single, "Sister Rosa." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, a Cinemax special airing in May, "The Neville Brothers 'Tell It 
Like It Is,' " will feature John Hiatt, Dennis Quaid, Jimmy Buffett, Bonnie 
Raitt and others, including "60 Minutes' " Bradley singing "60 Minute Man" with 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley will also be seen helping perform "Sister Rosa," a rap-reggae tribute 
to civil-rights pioneer Rosa Parks, whose insistence on her right to a "whites 
only" bus seat in Birmingham, Ala., in 1955 instigated the first confrontation 
of the then-fledgling movement. 
</P>
<P>
"From talking to kids, Cyril (who wrote the song with former Nevilles bassist 
Darryl Johnson) found that the kids didn't know very much about Afro-American 
history and had trouble remembering things they had learned in school, but 
didn't have trouble remembering all the words to a rap song," Neville said. "So 
(we) figured if we give them the information in that format, they'll take it in 
and remember it." 
</P>
<P>
"Sister Rosa" has plenty of socially conscious company on "Yellow Moon." In 
addition to band originals dealing with nuclear destruction and with suffering 
from South Africa to America's Indian reservations, there's a moving Aaron 
Neville reading of Sam Cooke's 1965 "A Change Is Gonna Come" and two early Bob 
Dylan broadsides, "With God on Our Side" and "The Ballad of Hollis Brown." 
</P>
<P>
Neville said, "We feel part of our job is in raising people's awareness and 
letting them know that we as artists are aware of conditions in the world and 
are concerned about them. . . . We're trying to help spread the idea that 
everyone can contribute to the change." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, the brothers' activities have ranged from involvement in a 
neighborhood youth center in New Orleans to contributing their services to the 
1987 Amnesty International tour, not the easiest investment of time and effort 
for a struggling band. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it just comes from all our experiences in life, the fact that we've 
been around since World War II (Charles is 50, Aaron is 48, Art is 51 and Cyril 
is 40) and have been performing since the '50s, and we've seen conditions in 
the world go through some pretty big changes, for better and worse. One of the 
biggest things was how in the '60s, people became more aware and desired to be 
more involved in determining what was happening with our lives. During the 
period afterward when that awareness went down, conditions got worse. Now it's 
absolutely necessary to have that awareness and concern," Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
The family's musical history stretches back to the mid-1950s when Art and his 
band the Hawkettes recorded the classic "Mardi Gras Mambo" about the same time 
Elvis Presley was discovering rockabilly in Memphis. Aaron's breathtakingly 
melismatic voice first gained national attention on "Tell It Like It Is" in 
1966, while Charles played with B. B. King, Bobby (Blue) Bland, Percy Mayfield, 
Stanley Turrentine and others. Art formed the ace studio band the Meters, sort 
of the New Orleans equivalent to Booker T. and the MGs, with Cyril joining up 
in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The four came together in 1976 to provide backing for the now-legendary "The 
Wild Tchoupitoulas" album, a remarkable documentation of the "Mardi Gras Indian 
Tribe" (a Louisiana African-American cultural tradition dating back to slavery) 
led by their uncle George (Big Chief Jolly) Landry. The brothers have continued 
together since then, remarkably free, Neville said, of the rivalries that mark 
other siblings. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd already gone our separate ways for many years. Then, working with George 
Landry, he reminded us that our parents had always wanted to see us work 
together. And when we came together to do that music, it all flowed together so 
smoothly and so easily and so freely, it genuinely amazed us. It was almost 
effortless. The combining of our different musical experiences as well as our 
different life experiences just made the spirit we projected much more than any 
of us separately could be." 
</P>
<P>
More than the disparate influences the brothers bring to the band, Neville 
credits their common New Orleans roots for the richness of their sound. "Music 
has been a part of our lives from the very beginning because it is so much a 
part of New Orleans," he said. "We heard all different kinds of music at home, 
at school, on the streets, everywhere. And the street music particularly got to 
us, the marching bands, the second-line bands, and the Mardi Gras Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"Music was encouraged in the homes. 
</P>
<P>
. . . The idea of music as something to do for spiritual and emotional growth 
is still passed down through families from generation to generation." Prime 
examples being Aaron's son Ivan, now denting the charts, and Charles' daughters 
Charmaigne and Rowena, popular New Orleans performers. 
</P>
<P>
"Yellow Moon" is a considerable sonic departure for the band, melding their 
rhythmic gumbo with the atmospheric resonances Lanois has brought to his more 
famed clients. 
</P>
<P>
If the result doesn't sound like anything the Nevilles have recorded before, 
neither does it sound like anything now getting air play. Neville isn't 
concerned by that. The band's 1987 "Uptown" album, while funkier than most 
records issued that year, had also been the group's stab at mainstream 
appeasement, what Neville called "an experiment in trying to do stuff like what 
was on the radio." It was a crucial time, with Art speculating then that if the 
album didn't "go to the bank" the band might not be able to continue. 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, the record company was going through a merger and support for 
the album got lost in the shuffle, leaving the Nevilles no better off than they 
were before. But even after decades of finishing out of the money, Charles 
said, giving up was never a serious consideration. "Money is all right and nice 
and fun and wonderful if it happens, but that's not the main thing, which is 
the spiritual content of what we do and the fact that our main aim is to 
deliver a message of love. When we started playing music there was no money in 
it. That isn't why we're in the business." Neville laughed and said, "If it was 
we would have stopped a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Neville Brothers will play today at 8 and 10:30 p.m. at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. The first show is sold out. 
Tickets to the second show are $18.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

ARCHITECTURE FLUNKS HAPPINESS TEST, UCI AUDIENCE IS TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We are not making people happy in our buildings," architect Ricardo Legorreta 
of Mexico told a capacity audience at UC Irvine on Thursday night. "In good 
architecture, either a queen or a beggar would feel very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Decrying the fashionable status of architecture today and the cult of 
personality, Legorreta, 57, called architecture "an opportunity to continue 
God's work" and reminded his listeners that architects should serve society, 
bringing "good art, good taste and happiness to everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
The lecture was part of a series on museum design, but Legorreta chose not to 
show slides of his museum projects (the Children's Discovery Museum and the 
Technology Center of Silicon Valley, both in San Jose). Instead, he focused on 
his designs for private homes and two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important spaces are those in which you live," Legorreta said, adding 
that he sees no difference between architecture and interior design. 
</P>
<P>
He also showed a factory and an industrial complex, and it rapidly became clear 
that living or working in a Legorreta building involves a sensuous awareness of 
light, color and space akin to sensations evoked by certain environmental 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting rectangles and squares out of his simple, blocky walls, he creates 
windows that project inside instead of outside, and skylights that throw 
patterns of shadow and light on walls and floors. In one of his houses, he 
pointed out, the color of the walls changes according to the intensity of 
available light. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of creative pragmatism infuses his work. In one house, he made the main 
entrance the one that leads from the garage, because that's the path his 
clients normally took. For the 450-room Hotel Camino Real Ixtapa in Mexico, he 
took out all the public air conditioning (except for meeting rooms) and created 
outdoor seating areas for a 15% reduction in cost. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he asked, isn't it strange that in Mexico and Southern California, 
where the weather is so beautiful, we are always sitting in the air-conditioned 
indoors? So each bedroom in the hotel also has an outdoor terrace -- and each 
would have had a private pool, too, except that the hotel owner put his foot 
down. "They will not go to the bars and restaurants," he told the architect. 
"And there will be problems with room service." 
</P>
<P>
Water is a key factor in Legorreta's buildings. In the Ixtapa hotel, the public 
pools are "fountains in which you swim, instead of just swimming pools," he 
said, showing several slides of pools in which jets of water spurt fancifully 
into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Legorreta likes corridors and stairways ("There's nothing wrong with walking 
for the pleasure of it"). He is keen on surprises: the mass of the hotel blocks 
the view of the sea, letting the visitor discover it only after entering. 
</P>
<P>
And he enjoys punctuating his sturdy horizontal forms with simple, boldly 
colored vertical elements. A sculptural bright purple slab punctuated by a grid 
of small, square openings stands proudly against the blue sky in a 
hotel-office-retail complex in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The negative public response to the color was identical, the architect said, to 
the way people greeted the bright purple walls of Tustin Market Place, a 
Legorreta project designed with Leason Pomeroy Associates of Orange. But the 
people in Dallas listened when Legorreta asked them to wait and acclimate 
themselves to the surprising hue, he said. (In Tustin, the walls hastily were 
repainted brown by the Irvine Co.) 
</P>
<P>
A house Legorreta designed in a coastal area of southern Mexico was influenced 
in part by the bright blue of the sea. "A blue house!" he thought to himself. 
"Why not?" But the crowning touch by this master of nature-responsive 
architecture was to let the house "disappear" under a mass of brilliantly 
colored flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Architecture Foundation of Orange County and the Newport 
Harbor Art Museum -- for whose new building Legorreta had been short-listed, 
losing to Renzo Piano -- the lecture was supported by UCI, Haworth Inc. and 
Wavell-Huber Wood Products Inc. The next speaker in the series, on April 9 at 
7:30 p.m., is Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelblau, based in Vienna and Los Angeles.

FAMILY LIFE: WOMEN SPEAK OUT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN, Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They range in age from 22 to 78, married, single, divorced, from San Clemente 
to La Habra and everywhere in between. Some are mothers; others aren't. But 
they have some common bonds: Most have had abortions. All have been touched by 
the issue. And with only two exceptions, they believe abortion should remain 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
We don't pretend that our sampling is a scientific one; it isn't. We simply 
asked Family Life readers who have had abortions how they now feel about the 
decision. And we asked all of our readers to speak out on the issue as it 
affects them personally. 
</P>
<P>
The response was overwhelmingly lopsided in favor of abortion, surprising 
considering Orange County's reputation for conservatism in most matters. As a 
county, we may have been strongly behind George Bush in the 1988 presidential 
election, but if these letters are any indication, we tend to disagree with the 
41st President's anti-abortion stand. 
</P>
<P>
"To start off, I've had about a dozen friends who have had legal abortions," 
writes Christina, 22, of Newport Beach. "Some of these friends have even had 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just recently had an abortion, and I'm not proud of it. It's a very 
dramatic experience for any girl or woman to go through. I was lucky because 
the place I went was very private. . . . The people were very considerate and 
nice to me. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my friends went to a clinic where they had to wait 3 hours before the 
operation. They also had to wait in a large room, in paper gowns, with a dozen 
other girls. And this was a legal clinic! I couldn't imagine what clinics would 
be like if abortions became illegal! I don't regret my decision because I 
didn't have a choice in my situation. I'm only 22 years old and the father is 
just a good friend. I have too many future plans to stop and have a child right 
now, and also I couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see the point in (outlawing) abortions. What people don't seem to 
understand is that some girls will have to have them either way, and if they 
have to go to some quack of a doctor to get it done, they will. It will be 
twice as expensive and extremely dangerous. And I feel that instead of killing 
an embryo or whatever it really is, the lives of young girls and women will be 
at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Trina, who lives in Fountain Valley, doesn't have to imagine what it would be 
like if abortion was illegal. She can remember. 
</P>
<P>
"The year was 1969. I was 33, housewife and mother of four. We had a car, a 
camper and six dogs. Life was looking up. My family was complete. I was using 
an IUD." 
</P>
<P>
Trina said she was upset when she found out that she was pregnant. "I didn't 
want another baby." After her doctor ordered an X-ray to see if the IUD was 
still in place (it was), she was sure he would do an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"Nope. After all, it was conservative Orange County. But if I was willing to go 
through a psychiatric evaluation up north. . . . I was distraught, depressed 
and despondent, but I wasn't about to subject myself to a psych evaluation. So 
my doctor wrote a phone number on a piece of paper and wished me luck. It was 
the Clergy Counseling Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Much to my surprise and relief, my own minister was the local counselor, and 
he quickly set me up with . . . a clinic in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest was like a cheap cloak-and-dagger story. Get cash. Set up 
appointment. Fly to Mexico City (by myself, hubby had to baby-sit while mom 
'vacationed'). Call another number. Wait in front of hotel in cold gray dawn 
for a blue car. Have procedure. Go sightseeing with another woman I met at the 
clinic. Stash medication in bra for trip home. Make appointment for husband to 
have vasectomy. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never much thought about the rightness of this issue. This was a 
mass of cells that needed to be removed. . . . And I have always felt that 
viable life was that which could survive independent of the mother. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In the intervening years I have had no regrets. I have worked as a nurse for 
the past 13 years and continue to support freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
"I work with families where grandmothers are raising the babies of their 
teen-age daughters. I report several cases of child abuse a month. I see the 
overcrowded conditions at the Orangewood (Children's)Home. . . . I read the 
statistics on teen-age pregnancy and child abuse. The world is full of unwanted 
babies. The pain they and their families and those who work with them suffer is 
far greater than what some would say is suffered by an aborted fetus." 
</P>
<P>
"No one, not even pro-choice advocates, are 'for' abortion," writes an 
anonymous 36-year-old woman. "Nobody likes it." 
</P>
<P>
This woman said she had an illegal abortion in Laguna Beach in 1968, when she 
was 16 and a sophomore at Corona del Mar High School. "I drove down to Laguna 
with the only two people I have ever told about my abortion, my two closest 
girlfriends. They waited in my car while I entered the dark and rather dingy 
office. No one was there except the doctor. I paid him $300. He asked me my 
name, and I gave him a phony one. I was frightened to death. . . . And abortion 
was illegal, so I didn't know if the police were watching him. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the night in the bathroom of my girlfriend's house in total pain and 
fear. It was the most agonizing night of my life. It sounds so gruesome to say 
this, but I flushed the fetus down the toilet that night. The doctor had asked 
me to bring it back to him, but I could not bear to even look at it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Do I regret having that abortion? No way. When it was all over, I had never 
felt such feelings of relief. I had been given another chance at life! I was 
able to go on to college, to travel extensively, to fall in love with a 
wonderful man. I lived the life I had dreamed of for myself, not a life I was 
condemned to follow because of a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Another anonymous voice, from La Habra: "Five years ago, when I was 25, I had a 
legal abortion. . . . I'm not sure what my life would be like now if I had not 
had a choice. I was able to finish school and become financially stable. I plan 
to begin a family in the next year. . . . I see too many unwanted, abused, 
neglected, suicidal, unhappy and emotionally disturbed children in my work as a 
psychologist to think there could be a benefit to forcing a woman to have a 
child." "I am a 78-year-old woman," writes Gloria, from Santa Ana. "I have had 
two abortions and never regretted it, nor had one minute of guilt. I also have 
raised five children. I think these pro-lifers are interfering in something 
that is none of their business." 
</P>
<P>
And, from Kay of Fountain Valley: "I have never had an abortion, but I held my 
daughter's hand during hers. Unwanted pregnancy is an unfortunate fact of life. 
Unwanted children should not be." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, we'll hear from the dissenters, including a woman who is still in 
anguish more that 11 years after her abortion.
