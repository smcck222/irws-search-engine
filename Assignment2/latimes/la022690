Every year around this time, the California gray whales make their trip from 
the Bering Sea to Baja California, passing close to the California coastline. 
Going out to see the whales has become quite popular in recent years. In some 
cases, overzealous whale watchers have been accused of interfering with the 
whales' migration. 
</P>
<P>
One way to avoid disturbing the huge mammals and learn about their lives, 
habitat and the effects humans may have on them, is to attend an informational 
program or go along on one of several whale-watching tours offered by the many 
museums or marine life related groups in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, in conjunction with the American 
Cetacean Society, is having its 18th year of whale-watching trips every day

WINNING LOTTO TICKET SOLD IN CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tickets containing all six winning numbers in the California Lottery's weekend 
"Lotto 6-49" game were sold in Carlsbad and Eureka, lottery officials said 
Sunday, and each is worth $3,186,409. 
</P>
<P>
There were six tickets containing five winning numbers and the bonus number, 
and each was worth $282,498. The tickets were purchased in South Gate, Newhall, 
Los Angeles, Baker, Covina and Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
The winning numbers were: 18, 30, 33, 36, 44, 49 and the bonus number, 43. 
</P>
<P>
There were 277 tickets sold with five of six winning numbers, and each ticket 
was worth $3,152. Some 14,012 tickets with four of six winning numbers paid off 
at $56 each, and the 260,149 tickets with three of six winning numbers were 
worth an automatic $5 each. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's televised drawing was delayed for 50 minutes by what officials 
first thought was a breakdown of the machine that spits out the balls 
containing the winning numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was human error," California Lottery spokeswoman Carolyn Walker said later. 
</P>
<P>
She said a person who was supposed to press three buttons on the machine that 
randomly selects the numbers forgot to press the third button in the sequence. 
</P>
<P>
The buttons cause the numbered balls to drop out of the machine. Citizens are 
chosen randomly to press the buttons that release the numbered balls for the 
twice-weekly drawing, Walker said, because lottery employees are prohibited 
from starting the drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials already had stopped the 7:55 p.m. statewide broadcast of the 
drawing before they realized what went wrong, Walker said. When the final 
button was finally pressed, the balls dropped normally. 
</P>
<P>
Security cameras in the Sacramento TV studio made the required videotape of the 
drawing, so it is valid even though it wasn't broadcast live, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Sales from Wednesday night to Saturday's drawing were $15,878,153. Wednesday's 
lottery jackpot is expected to be worth about $5 million.

GROWTH: ANTI-DEVELOPMENT FORCES AIM TO STABILIZE LIFE AND BAR NEWCOMERS. BUT 
BETTER USE OF MARKET FORCES COULD MAKE ROOM FOR EVERYONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. MOORE, James E. Moore is an assistant professor of urban and 
regional planning and civil engineering at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles is blessed with full participation in the Pacific Rim and North 
America, two of the globe's three principal economies. The immediate 
five-county region is the fastest-growing industrialized megacity on the 
planet, under circumstances in which the demand for skilled labor exceeds the 
supply (unlike the equally explosive but utterly destructive urban growth in 
the Third World). 
</P>
<P>
This robust growth provides an astounding level of opportunity, but long-term 
residents are naturally apprehensive. Such technical, economic and social rates 
of change are not to everyone's liking. Yet in trying to make sense of our 
growth, we must approach the special case of Los Angeles with caution. We are, 
after all, participating in market opportunities that are unparalleled in human 
history. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the debate about how to manage growth often invokes images of a 
quaint, pre-automotive urban form that was never representative of life in Los 
Angeles, offers no satisfaction to modern households and would require an 
incredible diversion of resources to create. 
</P>
<P>
It is foolish to try to impose this vision, but we do. Construction on Metro 
Rail continues apace, even though the 1980 census showed that only 3% of the 
metropolitan area's jobs are in downtown Los Angeles. Research by USC indicates 
that the region's 19 major employment centers account for only 17.5% of its 
jobs. The rest are dispersed in patterns not effectively served by fixed-route 
systems. The subsidies needed to keep the trains operating would bleed the 
funds available for more productive transportation services, including buses 
and management technologies, such as synchronization of traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the dismay about freeway congestion, commuting times in the 
five-county area are not increasing. Average work-trip times held almost 
constant from 1976 (24.4 minutes) to 1980 (24.3 minutes), and decreased to 22.4 
minutes in 1985. Media accounts of the commuter experience dwell on the 
hardship cases. The truth is that adjustments in life style, hours of travel 
and location have mitigated the cost of new bottlenecks. The most obvious of 
these adjustments is decentralization, shifting growth to the urban periphery. 
</P>
<P>
Many current residents see no benefits in continued growth. Local land 
development is usually interpreted as encroachment. Local, domestic and 
international immigrants are viewed as a source of disquieting change. Slow- 
and no-growth advocates couch their quality-of-life arguments as a conflict 
between residents and developers, or between residents and local government. In 
truth, arguments that transactions on land, buildings, and infrastructure 
should be limited or capped focus entirely on the effects these transactions 
have on existing residents; they ignore the benefits, from jobs to housing, 
that are brought to new residents. 
</P>
<P>
At the core of the slow- and no-growth movement is a philosophical assertion 
that local residents may enhance the quality of their own lives by withholding 
economic opportunity from non-residents. That this point of view is contrary to 
the moral and economic foundations of our society is less important than the 
self-destructive policies the no-growth argument promotes. The only way to 
forestall growth is to remove the economic incentives that drive it, but we 
cannot maintain a strong economy in the absence of change. Growth can be 
managed, but it cannot be suppressed by other than Draconian restrictions that 
would benefit few at the expense of many, including most current residents. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, even if public policy-makers embrace slow-growth principles, it is 
unlikely that their policies would actually manage to subvert Los Angeles' 
unique economy. Slow-growth interventions are inefficient, but our marketplace 
is probably strong enough to forgive even serious public policy mistakes. 
Opposition to national and global economic forces is not evil. It's just not a 
winning proposition. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, winning propositions that would help us to accommodate 
growth while retaining and enhancing the quality of life in Los Angeles. Once 
the role of price as a balancer of supply and demand is understood, prices 
become superb public-policy instruments. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the decision to drive on a road imposes delay on other users of 
the facility. A "congestion toll" would ensure that the individual accounts for 
such costs before deciding to drive. If the trip is not postponed, it should be 
because its value to the individual exceeds the social cost of the additional 
congestion the driver creates. Market forces, in the form of transferable 
development rights, are also an efficient means for controlling land-use 
densities. If the right to develop land must be bid away from neighbors who 
must subsequently forgo development of their own sites, or even from the state, 
local densities would be reduced. This would require very little in the way of 
administrative oversight, because markets operate on the voluntary 
self-interest of buyers and sellers. Similarly, a well-organized market for 
transferable pollution rights would improve overall local air quality without 
the cumbersome interventions proposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
</P>
<P>
We have an open society, and we cannot expect to retain the advantages of our 
unique economy without sharing with the new residents who will inevitably 
settle here. Subverting the markets for urban land and development is unlikely 
to control growth, and if it does it can only be because we have managed to 
outlaw the special economic advantages of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The marketplace that makes this region attractive to so many people is not the 
enemy of current residents. In truth, the organizing capacity of our markets 
may prove to be our salvation. We have much more to gain by harnessing our 
markets and using the incentives they provide for the public good than we do by 
suspending market transactions.

By JOE DOMANICK, Joe Domanick is a Los Angeles writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About a week ago, I read an article by a woman living in New York City -- a 
place where the cops long ago lost control. In the story, titled "Being Safe," 
a Manhattan mother describes how she has been robbed of her wallet 11 times; 
her son has been mugged and had two bikes stolen; her car has been broken into 
three times and stolen once; and her husband has been held up at gunpoint while 
walking the dog. As a result, she is now quite deliberately teaching her 
children not only how to protect themselves but how to be fearful as well. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, those of us living west of La Brea or in the city's numerous 
middle-class suburbs don't face such problems, at least on a daily, 
rule-your-life basis. I feel comfortable, for example, when my wife takes our 
2-year-old to parks in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills near our home. One 
reason is the hyper-segregation and great distances that shield the middle and 
upper-middle classes here from the underclass that commits so much of the 
street crime that we all -- of whatever race or origin -- so fear. And there 
is, in addition, another reason. The police in Los Angeles have not given up as 
they seem to have in New York. Instead, they continue to be aggressive, 
hard-working and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
But as James Fyfe, a former cop and now a professor of justice at American 
University in Washington, has pointed out, it's not enough for a police force 
in a democratic society to merely be responsive. It must, like all government 
institutions, be accountable as well. In the 1960s, for example, the cops in 
Selma, Ala., were responsive but unaccountable when they attacked-civil rights 
demonstrators on the Raymond Petty Bridge. So, too, with the Chicago police who 
attacked demonstrators during the 1968 Democratic Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, it's been hard to pick up the Times without wondering if the Los 
Angeles Police Department, the Sheriff's Department and local elected officials 
have any interest in accountability. 
</P>
<P>
In the past several months, for example, we've seen the city offer $3 million 
in settlement of a federal lawsuit brought by the victims of a 1988 drug raid 
on Dalton Ave., near the Coliseum, in which 80 LAPD officers terrorized 55 
citizens and literally destroyed four apartments in two buildings. The Red 
Cross had to provide temporary shelter, as if some vast natural disaster had 
occurred. In spite of all this, city officials have expressed little public 
outrage, leaving unquestioned the leadership of Chief Daryl Gates in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
We've also had Mayor Bradley urge, and the City Council unanimously vote, to 
have the city pay a $170,000 judgment leveled against Gates personally by a 
federal jury in a suit by an Eastside man, Jesse Larez, whose nose was broken 
during a search of his home in 1986. During the trial of the suit, two years 
later, Gates said, "(He's) probably lucky that's all he had broken. How much is 
a broken nose worth? . . . I don't think it's worth anything." As with the 
Dalton Ave. raid, there has been almost no criticism of Gates' remarks by city 
officials or by a liberal community that has been vociferous about human rights 
in South Africa, Central America and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Nor have we heard any real criticism of the gang sweeps, which are, after all, 
just the random shaking down on a mass scale of young black and Latino men by 
the LAPD. Indeed, a just-published Times poll shows that more than one-third of 
blacks in Los Angeles and Orange counties said that "they or a family member 
had been intimidated or harassed by law-enforcement officers." 
</P>
<P>
And when the LAPD used brutal "pain compliance" holds and nunchaku sticks on 
anti-abortion demonstrators, the silence from city leaders and liberal 
activists was deafening. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has any city official publicly questioned the latest of several stake-out 
shootings by the Special Investigations Section, a unit of the LAPD that 
recently shot and killed three robbery suspects and wounded a fourth (none of 
whom ever fired their weapons, later found to be pellet guns) outside a Sunland 
McDonald's. One of the officers involved had shot seven other suspects since 
1978; two others had each shot three suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department has, since the new year, fired 26 shots at a woman who 
refused to drop her gun, killing her; shot and killed a black Muslim during a 
routine traffic stop; and shot and killed an unarmed Lynwood man, hitting him 
12 to 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of the mayor, City Council and Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors to speak up on these matters is, to be sure, rooted in the special 
autonomy enjoyed by both the police chief and the sheriff, and in the 
historically conservative political nature of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But I have a further explanation. It has to do with Reaganomics, Proposition 13 
and the failure to replace thousands of lost manufacturing jobs. It has also to 
do with the benign neglect of a mayor, City Council and Board of Supervisors 
who watched South Central and other areas fester and erupt in terrible gang 
violence, then told the cops to get in there and do something about it. Police 
accountability -- always on shaky ground here -- has once again gotten lost in 
the shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
All of which brings me back to the streets of two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice of walking them without fear or accepting unnecessary police 
violence, most people will take safe streets every time. It's hard to fathom 
why, however, with police departments as highly trained as the LAPD and the 
Sheriff's Department, and in a nation as rich as ours, we have to choose 
between the two.

CARING FOR DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by John Hurst "Home for Retarded, Disabled to Close" (Metro, Feb. 
5) did not completely depict the situation at Lynwood Care Center or at any 
large intermediate-care facility for the developmentally disabled operating in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years there has been a concerted effort by the California 
Department of Developmental Services to depopulate the larger homes serving the 
developmentally disabled and move these clients into a more home-like 
environment, specifically 6-15 bed homes. This philosophy though strong in 
idea, has left a void in the health care system serving the developmentally 
disabled client because not all clients are independent enough to function in 
these environments. The clients not suitable for smaller homes are profoundly 
retarded and require continuous assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities such as Lynwood Care Center are now responsible to care for a much 
more involved client, requiring an intense amount of both professional and 
direct care time to meet the needs of these clients. This change in client 
needs has caused the costs of services to soar. The industry serving these 
clients, along with Beverly Enterprises, is making every effort to provide the 
quality care these clients deserve. Yet the resources required to meet these 
needs far exceed the reimbursement level set by the state. As an example, this 
variance would have been a negative $850,000 for this current year at Lynwood 
Care Center. 
</P>
<P>
This situation is an industry-wide problem that requires immediate attention. 
Beverly Enterprises is working with state officials to find a solution to this 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
We are proud of the care our employees deliver to our residents in all of our 
nursing facilities. If any of your readers would like to see one of our 
facilities firsthand, please feel free to contact the facility directly for a 
tour.

MORE ROUGH WEATHER FOR THE B-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington's General Accounting Office argues that further production of the 
B-2 Stealth bomber should be put on hold until the Pentagon knows whether the 
airplane will work. Congress should do just that. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's GAO report will of course ignite a debate of the chicken-or-egg 
variety. Supporters of the B-2 will argue that stalling production for the 
three years it will take to complete testing will make the plane more expensive 
than it already is (something over $70 billion for a fleet of 132 planes). But 
the GAO report says that costs are already over that estimate, and the only 
question is how much higher they would go if production were stretched out. The 
GAO says, for example, that in less than 31 hours of testing, problems have 
already been found in the plane's electronic system. 
</P>
<P>
The argument of backers of the B-2 is valid only if one assumes that the plane 
will perform exactly as the Air Force wants it to -- an assumption that is hard 
to swallow when one considers the problem-plagued performance of the last fleet 
of bombers the Pentagon bought, the B-1b. This plane simply cannot fly some of 
the missions it was designed for. Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairman of the 
House Armed Services Committee, says that it never will. 
</P>
<P>
That's an arguable point, but even if the B-2 bomber turned out perfectly, it 
would not answer the many questions about whether the United States needs a 
fleet of bombers that have been designed to swoop down on targets without 
warning because they are invisible to radar. After all, the Pentagon has yet to 
describe, at least publicly, any target for the B-2 that could not be reached 
by other weapons systems already in service. And with Washington and Moscow 
pressing forward to new arms-control agreements, the number of potential 
targets presumably will be going down, not up. All this means that the 
rationale for the B-2 is decreasing, not increasing.

STATE'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reporter William Trombley hit the target. The Golden State is losing its luster 
-- freeways crumble, students sit two to a desk, our water and air are 
polluted. 
</P>
<P>
I know the problems well from my tenure on the Los Angeles Board of Education 
and, more recently, on the Los Angeles Board of Public Works. As our population 
grows beyond the available public facilities, our quality of life will continue 
to deteriorate, unless we do something. First, we should conduct an inventory 
of the state's needs for new highways, schools, pollution control systems, and 
so forth. Setting up a comprehensive multi-year plan for addressing those needs 
would follow. 
</P>
<P>
Next, we must make better use of bond financing. According to the state's 
independent Legislative Analyst's Office, California has considerable room to 
authorize and issue more bonds without being financially imprudent. The voters 
understand this since they have supported 38 out of 39 bond measures on the 
state ballot. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sacramento has not gotten the message! Nearly $7 billion in 
voter-approved bonds, including those for clean water, school facilities, parks 
and prisons, have not yet been issued. 
</P>
<P>
But we should not rely on bond financing alone to pay for urgently needed 
infrastructure improvement and repair; some projects should be financed by user 
fees. This appears to be the fairest and surest way of guaranteeing safe 
bridges and highways. 
</P>
<P>
My father, former Gov. Pat Brown, envisioned California's future and 
thoughtfully laid the foundation of public facilities that continues to provide 
for our well-being 20 years later. But that foundation is showing signs of age. 
It's time we renew the commitment that made California the Golden State.

JOB LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Jones' column "Fouling the Air With Numbers" (Part A, Feb. 8) was salty 
and impressive. 
</P>
<P>
However, I apparently did not explain clearly the methodology used. 
</P>
<P>
The 50% number Jones quoted so freely referred to the maximum loss of jobs in 
industry sub-segments that will have powerful economic incentives to depart. It 
overstates my research findings for some sectors. 
</P>
<P>
The main point is this: Hundreds of thousands will lose their jobs and then 
wait (pump gas or go on relief) until someone invents the new technology 
needed. The pain of a two- or three-year period of joblessness can be 
excruciating -- and for the less skilled people may become permanent. New jobs 
in 1994 for new college grads cannot cover the pain of the blue-collar workers 
laid off in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
To elaborate, Jones omitted my comments about Southern California growth 
prospects being great enough to create jobs for many newcomers -- particularly 
highly skilled technicians and scientists -- but not for the woodworkers, 
plasterers, furniture finishers and the like who would be losing their jobs 
along with the market for their skills. 
</P>
<P>
There are a lot more humane considerations in the numbers than we have seen in 
print yet.

ANOTHER BILLION ON THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without birth-rate stabilization, populations will continue to outrun food 
supplies and economic advances, condemning millions to deteriorating incomes 
and marginal nutrition -- if not starvation. This is the message of compelling 
new studies that underscore the critical importance of government-funded 
birth-control programs. 
</P>
<P>
In the developing nations of the world, contraceptive programs are essential to 
population stabilization, according to a new analysis by the Population Crisis 
Committee. Global population could be stabilized at 9 billion, compared with 
5.2 billion at the present time, if existing population programs in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America are tripled. That would be 4 billion to 5 billion 
fewer than if growth continues on its existing course. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, publicly funded family- planning services have proven 
remarkably cost-effective, according to another new study, this one by the Alan 
Guttmacher Institute. The report found that in 1987, federal and state programs 
cost $412 million and resulted in a saving of $1.8 billion in public funds that 
otherwise would have gone for medical and welfare costs. "These savings 
represent an average of $4.40 saved for every dollar spent to provide 
contraceptive services," according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of both reports is fortuitous. The report on the importance of 
contraceptives in global population control will serve to strengthen proposals 
for an enlarged role by the U.S. government in providing foreign aid for 
population-control activities. The program has been handicapped by imposition 
of regulations denying assistance through two of the most effective avenues, 
the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned 
Parenthood Federation. The report on the efficacy of American programs to 
subsidize contraceptives for low-income families comes as the Senate takes up 
reauthorization of Title X of the Public Health Service Act. This legislation 
has, since 1970, funded access to basic health screening, comprehensive family 
planning (but not abortions), and referrals for millions of poor women. 
</P>
<P>
A third study, by the United Nations, provides the ominous context in which 
population programs must be planned. The world's population will increase by 
another billion in this decade. This year alone, 90 million people will be 
added. Only a rapid expansion of contraceptive distribution can accelerate 
population stabilization.

SOVIET UNION: ITS PEOPLE ARE THRASHING ABOUT IN THE VOID LEFT BY THE COLLAPSE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Russian Revolution of November, 1917, is long since dead, buried under 
disabused hopes and discredited economics. The new Soviet revolution under way 
will determine the nation's destiny, but so far it has no clarity. 
</P>
<P>
Confusion extends from members of the Supreme Soviet to Moscow's intellectual 
elite to the average worker. It is reflected in a street scene on a snowy 
Sunday morning: The queue of fur-capped Muscovites waiting to visit Lenin's 
tomb is little longer than that winding toward the new McDonald's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
For any American with Moscow experience, the quality of discussion is stunning. 
As opposed to the past, the United States is blamed for nothing. No one is 
silent or adverts to slogans from Communist Party hand-outs. Government 
bureaucrats recite a devastating litany of economic failure in a country that 
has long pretended to be the United States' rival. Party stalwarts try to keep 
the faith, but do so in terms of "socialist renewal" rather than adherence to 
old dogma. Intellectuals in government institutes ignore the presence of 
foreigners and open microphones as they wash every conceivable bit of dirty 
linen in pursuit of a viable alternative to the wretched status quo. They 
accept the attendant risks of retribution if President Mikhail Gorbachev falls 
from power. 
</P>
<P>
Despite initial doubts in the United States, the Soviet crisis is not about 
tactics or tinkering: It is about the very purpose and possibilities of the 
state and its relationship to a people that has never been enfranchised. The 
word democracy is no longer used as propaganda; rather, in some form, democracy 
is seen as a necessary instrument of politics, pluralism and gaining popular 
support for radically transforming society. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, change in the Soviet Union is largely viewed in terms of foreign 
policy. Eastern Europe has come out from under Moscow's dominance, even though 
600,000 Soviet soldiers remain deployed there. Germany is uniting, even though 
Kremlin leaders object to the method. But in Moscow, these are seen as 
secondary matters because the only game in town is the future of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
A new repression may still be possible. Bonapartism -- the military's 
imposition of authority -- cannot be ruled out, perhaps with Gorbachev as his 
own Napoleon. But the old structures are clearly finished. All means of mass 
communication, including lengthy television coverage of fractious and liberal 
debate in the Supreme Soviet, tell every Soviet citizen that the era of V. I. 
Lenin is over. Its place is filled by a consuming void -- an economy that has 
more qualities of the developing world than of the West, a dispiriting 
bleakness to everyday life, an absence of incentives to do one's best, a rise 
in crime, a vacuum of values now that Marxism-Leninism is shown to have been a 
sham. 
</P>
<P>
Against this background of moral and philosophical collapse, efforts by 
Gorbachev and others to create something else are all the more impressive, 
especially because no one is confident that any alternative will work. The 
certitude of Leninist theology, measured against results, has bred generations 
of skeptics. Yet there is growing consensus, even among unreconstructed 
Communists, that two elements are critical: an economy that is at least 
responsive to market forces, and the development of a politics that can provide 
popular legitimacy for change. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his allies are trying to build a foundation in law for economic 
overhaul that, among other things, will mean a vastly reduced role for the 
Communist Party. Debate now centers on the possibility of private property. At 
some point, perestroika must accept a price mechanism that will permit valid 
economic choices to replace bureaucratic fiat. And with this price mechanism 
must come an end to subsidies, acknowledgment of unemployment, a reduced living 
standard for most people, and a social uncertainty not known since the Great 
Patriotic War of 1941-45. 
</P>
<P>
Most Soviet leaders and observers would prefer that this change come about 
step-by-step, with each advance ratified through an emerging public opinion and 
in elections, which have shown a healthy tendency to "throw the rascals out." 
But such an approach has been described as akin to motorists' trying to shift, 
a little at a time, from driving on the left to driving on the right: At some 
point, a crash is likely. 
</P>
<P>
After five years in power, Mikhail Gorbachev is thus given some benefit of the 
doubt in trying to do the undoable. He is credited with sanctioning an amazing 
tolerance for public debate. He is largely forgiven for unleashing pressures by 
non-Russian republics for independence. (Whatever their political status, so 
the argument in Moscow goes, these republics will continue to be tied 
economically to Russia.) But he is rapidly losing popularity because the lives 
of average Soviet citizens have become worse. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, therefore, thoughtful members of the Soviet elite hope that the 
West, and especially the United States, will help the Soviet Union in its 
historic predicament. President Bush is credited with at least not making 
matters worse. But while the West should be responsive, no one other than the 
Soviet peoples can surmount this current time of troubles to create a society 
that must be changed more radically than Lenin ever envisioned.

<P>
LABOR: BY ORGANIZING, LIVING STANDARDS OF LOW-WAGE WORKERS COULD BE IMPROVED, 
LIMITING PRESSURE FOR NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. BUT LABOR LAW MUST FIRST BE 
REFORMED.

<TEXT>
<P>
Income polarization is a legacy of the 1980s. From 1979 to 1987, the living 
standards of the richest fifth of American families rose by 19%. Those of the 
poorest fifth fell by 9%. 
</P>
<P>
During this business cycle, professional-technical occupations grew. But even 
more low-wage jobs in services and in labor-intensive manufacturing were 
created. By 1988, real wages, on average, were lower than at any time since 
1960. Poverty, once associated with unemployment, now comes with full-time 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Sacramento acknowledge crises of the working poor -- no health 
insurance, a shortage of low-income housing, child care's prohibitive cost. 
But, our leaders insist, tight budgets preclude new public programs. Instead, 
President Bush, using imagery of a "thousand points of light," pushes for 
private solutions. 
</P>
<P>
One private-sector solution, though shunned by conservatives, is unionization. 
It would improve living standards of low-wage workers, limiting pressure for 
new government programs. 
</P>
<P>
Today, barely 10% of private-sector workers are represented by unions. Labor's 
decline has aggravated urban poverty. Of the 37 million Americans without 
health insurance, two-thirds are employees or their dependents. Most work for 
non-union firms. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' work force now includes more than 300,000 in such low-wage 
industries as furniture, apparel, hotels and restaurants; 90% of them are 
non-union. Many earn minimum wage or less and receive no health benefits. A 
single apartment is frequently home for several of their families. 
</P>
<P>
What few union contracts there are in these industries usually specify an 
hourly rate of $6 to $7. Health insurance is almost always part of the 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The collective bargaining that produces these contracts preserves 
private-sector flexibility. The firms' ability to pay sets the upper limits on 
what unions can win. Sometimes, unions miscalculate, demanding contracts so 
rich that a firm can't survive. But recent history shows that when troubled 
companies have demanded wage and benefit reductions, unions often have gone 
along. Still, even the resulting lower wage scales remain higher than pay at 
comparable non-union firms. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, 200,000 workers a year, on average, were organized. In the 1980s, 
organizing rates were halved while low-wage employment grew. Possible reasons 
included labor's lack of resources devoted to recruiting, union corruption and 
publicity about "givebacks." But various legal obstacles to organizing and the 
impotence of labor law in the face of new employer tactics are the primary 
causes of the decline. Indeed, while Americans applaud Solidarity in Poland, 
U.S. labor law practically forecloses the right to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 3,000 Nissan workers in Tennessee voted against United Auto Workers 
representation. During the months leading up to the vote, Nissan broadcast 
anti-union messages on TV monitors located throughout its factory. To respond 
to this TV barrage, UAW organizers, barred from the plant, had to search out 
employee home addresses, visiting the workers in the evenings and on weekends. 
The law does not require that unions be given a voter list until several weeks 
before the vote, even though a campaign can run a year or longer. 
</P>
<P>
Americans would normally consider such election procedures -- one party having 
exclusive access to TV and to voter lists, requiring voters to listen to 
one-sided campaign rhetoric during paid working time -- unfair. Yet, this is 
how the National Labor Relations Board conducts representation elections to 
test if workers freely choose a union. 
</P>
<P>
The board and various court decisions have progressively diluted worker rights 
to free elections. For example, before 1980, if a company fired a union 
activist for tardiness, it had to produce records showing that late non-union 
workers had been similarly discharged. Under current rules, it is the union, 
though lacking access to personnel records, that must research and prove that a 
company discriminated against a union worker. Also, firings were previously 
unlawful if partly motivated by workers' union affiliation. Now, the labor 
relations board permits firms to cite union activism as a cause for dismissal, 
provided employers can demonstrate the legitimacy of other reasons. In short, 
the law protects only perfect employees. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the House of Representatives voted for labor law reform that would 
have eliminated the most egregious impediments to union organizing. But Senate 
supporters fell two votes short of the 60 needed to end an anti-union 
filibuster. The bill died. 
</P>
<P>
That legislation would have required union elections to be scheduled more 
promptly, increased the penalties for retaliating against union activists, 
provided unions with greater access to voters (including equal time when 
companies propagandize employees at the workplace) and allowed compensation to 
workers denied wage improvements because their companies unlawfully refused to 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Today, unionization of low-wage workers is not only a matter of their welfare. 
All taxpayers have an interest in encouraging collective bargaining to reduce 
the working poor's burden on public services. Toward that end, labor law reform 
should be made a priority by conservatives and liberals alike. The right of 
low-wage workers to improve their lot, without government subsidy, is surely 
one of those thousand points of light.

TIBET: IT'S NOT JUST A NATION, BUT A NOTION -- THE HALF-MYTHIC PLACE OF OUR

Before I went to Tibet, I assumed that all the reports I had heard about the 
"Abode of Gods," from Tibetans and their friends, were fairy tales or wishful 
thoughts. After I came back from Tibet, I was myself a fabulist. For the air 
itself, along those unearthly plateaus, seemed to vibrate with a fervor and 
intensity I had never seen, or even imagined. And its spirit was quite 
different from the pleasant calm one finds amid the other remote places of the 
High Himalayas, in the monasteries of Nepal or the desolate mountains of 
Bhutan. In Tibet, devoutness charged the air like windblown prayer flags. 
</P>
<P>
I remember seeing pilgrims walking across the whole inhospitable breadth of the 
land to visit the sacred places of Lhasa. Old men and women labored up steep 
mountainsides to give what they had to monks. The square outside the Jokhang 
Temple was filled from dawn to midnight with votaries performing three-part 
prostrations. And once, when I gave a monk a picture of the exiled Dalai Lama, 
he wept. 
</P>
<P>
Today, that faith, that culture, that intensity, are on the brink of 
extinction. All but 13 of Tibet's 6,254 temples have been reduced to rubble by 
the Chinese. More than 1 million Tibetans have been killed. Monks are still 
being tortured, and nuns raped. Ganden Monastery, which bustled two generations 
ago with the chanting of lamas, the cut and thrust of debate, the jostle of a 
thriving city on a hill, is little more now than broken walls. The Drepung, 
once the largest monastery in the world, carries no voice but the wind's. 
</P>
<P>
The systematic desecration of Tibet has been continuing for 40 years. Now, 
though, an entirely new culture is being set up in its place. In order to 
adulterate the race, Beijing has flooded the area with Han Chinese, so that 
Tibetans are outnumbered in their capital by 3 to 1. The Jokhang is studded 
with the butts of AK-47s. In the shadow of the 13-story Potala Palace, the 
rulers have erected a Holiday Inn. The land once known as Shambhala is home to 
more than 300,000 soldiers; Shangri-La is now a nuclear-testing site. 
</P>
<P>
Tibet, in fact, has lived under the shadow of martial law since three months 
before last year's massacre in Beijing. And as March 10, the 31st anniversary 
of the Tibetan uprising, draws near, the cycle of rebellion and repression 
seems certain to start up again. 
</P>
<P>
At stake, however, is something more than just a stretch of land. For Tibet has 
always been as much a symbol as a site. And today, Tibet is as much a notion, 
as a nation, under siege. For centuries, Tibet was the name we gave to our 
loftiest imaginings, that high, half-mythic place, not far below the heavens, 
where the air was pure and rarefied and the colors sharp. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, the country seemed hardly to exist on any map except that of the 
inner eye: Until 10 years ago, fewer than 2,000 Westerners had ever set foot in 
the Forbidden Land. For two millennia, Tibet was that magic realm three miles 
above the sea where a culture could live apart from the world, in peace; the 
place where God-Kings were discovered at the age of 2, and monks were said to 
run in trances for 60 miles or more. Tibet was the place where anything could 
happen. A down-to-earth Austrian mountaineer, Heinrich Harrer, escaped from his 
POW camp in India, stumbled into Tibet and ended up as tutor to the Living 
Buddha. Tibet was our lost horizon. 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, Tibet has always been the property of us all, and all of us have 
cause to care about the rooftop of the world. If Tibet is destroyed, something 
precious inside us will be lost: a refuge, perhaps, or the hope that faith can 
hold out against cynicism, a peaceful theocracy survive even in the global 
village. 
</P>
<P>
As what was once a wistful parenthesis in the world's imagination becomes a 
bloody question-mark, it is not just two cultures, but two concepts, that are 
clashing in Tibet: the belief that everything must fit into some geopolitical 
equation, and the hope that something can exist apart from that, above it. 
</P>
<P>
In the XIVth Dalai Lama, the Tibetans are blessed with one of the most winning 
and dignified leaders in the world today. Even skeptical journalists who come 
into contact with his mischievous warmth and good nature come away staunch 
Tibetans. And true to the Buddhist ideals of compassion and detachment, the man 
who calls himself "a simple Buddhist monk" has gone out of his way to bring 
balance to the tangled issue, acknowledging that his homeland had to pay the 
price for being too isolated from the world, refusing to cast blame upon its 
Chinese enemies. Almost alone among worldly (and unworldly) leaders, he has 
mastered the conference table without abandoning his hold on gentleness and 
principle. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I talked to the Dalai Lama was in October, the day after he had 
been awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. It was an exceptionally busy time for 
him and his small staff as they fielded requests, congratulations and 
suggestions from around the world. The Living Buddha had a thousand things to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when I burst in on him, he not only took time out, and whisked me off to a 
little room for a chat, but as soon as we entered, started bustling around to 
find me a soft cushion. The God-King refused to sit down until he had made the 
pestersome reporter comfortable. It was that simple gesture -- a kindness 
natural as breathing -- that moved me as much as anything he said. And it is 
that spirit that the guns would level.

SAME SONG, DIFFERENT VERSE FOR CLIPPERS IN 107-106 LOSS TO SPURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The scene has been replayed over and over this season for the Clippers: close 
call at the end, coaches get the tape immediately after the game and watch the 
crucial play. No one leaves the room happy. 
</P>
<P>
It happened again Sunday night, and the ending was no different, a 107-106 loss 
to San Antonio at the Sports Arena. Maybe the Clippers should at least get 
residuals because they're not getting any victories in these things. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how hard we play," Coach Don Casey said, pleased and frustrated at 
the same time, "we need to get some W's." 
</P>
<P>
The plot worked to perfection for a while, the Clippers having come from 13 
points down late in the third quarter to keep pressure on San Antonio. They 
even led one of the league's best teams, 106-105, when Ken Norman hit two free 
throws with 15.4 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
And then . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio got the ball in the low post to David Robinson, who went left into 
the lane. He collided with Charles Smith, who was standing with his back to the 
ball while guarding another Spur. Referee Tommy Nunez called Smith for the 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson made both free throws with 7.3 seconds remaining to give San Antonio 
the victory, the Clippers' final attempt having resulted in a Winston Garland 
airball from the right baseline when the 7-foot-1 Robinson came out to 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes, the Clippers' sixth one-point defeat of the season. The routine 
of close losses, not surprisingly, may be wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
"They are young enough to be resilient," Casey said of his team. "But we need a 
win to get uplifted. I'm tired of these endings, and I think the players are, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers haven't won since Feb. 8, the final game before the All-Star 
break, in a run that stretches seven games. Even longer, they have lost 14 of 
17, and are 21-33 overall. 
</P>
<P>
But not always playing like it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating, but we've been better the last few games," said Smith, who 
played only five minutes in the first half because of foul trouble but finished 
with 17 of his team-high 23 points in the final two quarters. "I saw a lot out 
there tonight. I think we've got a team, and we are going to start a winning 
streak." 
</P>
<P>
What he, and the crowd of 14,041, saw was the Clippers falling behind by 12 
points in the first quarter and 14 in the second. They came back to tie the 
game by halftime, 62-62, with a 9-2 run in the final 1:51 of the period. 
</P>
<P>
And then they scored 17 points in the third quarter, taking on another 
double-digit deficit, including 84-71 with 2:57 left on Robinson free throws 
for two of his 26 points, to go with 14 rebounds and five blocked shots. The 
Clippers made five of 20 shots in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth, they cut the lead to three points when Garland, in his first 
game as a Clipper after being acquired from Golden State last Thursday for two 
second-round draft choices, connected on a 20-foot jump shot. But the San 
Antonio cushion soon went back to seven, then dropped to one, and, finally, the 
Clippers tied the score, 100-100, on Smith's jump shot from the foul line with 
2:16 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Their first lead since 2-0 came moments later when as Manning made two free 
throws with 1:41 left in a 102-100 game. Rod Strickland made a layup, then 
David Rivers sank two free throws to put the Clippers up, 104-102. From there, 
no lead was bigger than one the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland made a free throw with 1:03 remaining, and Robinson converted two 
more with 33 seconds to play to give San Antonio the lead, 105-104. Norman hit 
his two, and the Clippers were up. 
</P>
<P>
That set the stage for Robinson and the final trip to the line in a 
longer-than-usual 2-hour, 26-minute game that included 73 free throws, 43 by 
the Clippers. Turned out, though, the game still ended too soon for them. 
</P>
<P>
Two Clippers played 40-plus minutes, Norman and Benoit Benjamin, the latter a 
big surprise. After missing four consecutive games with the flu, Benjamin was 
expected to go 10 to 15 minutes in a reserve role, but he started and went 40. 
</P>
<P>
"I was all right," he said. "A little bit rusty, but my wind was OK." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin was right on both counts. He made just four of 12 attempts, but did 
manage three blocks and six rebounds -- including three offensive -- against a 
very tough opponent, Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Winston Garland played 22 minutes and both backcourt positions in his Clipper 
debut. He was most impressive at shooting guard while paired with David Rivers, 
hitting three of four attempts to open the game and finishing five of 10 for 15 
points, but three assists and six turnovers . . . The Spurs have won 11 of the 
last 12 meetings at the Sports Arena . . . Despite problems at guard, the 
Clippers continue to handle the ball well, or at least better than their league 
average. Averaging an NBA-high 19 turnovers a game coming in, they had 14 
Sunday, after 14 at Denver and 11 against Utah.

TRAVEL-WEARY ARIZONA BARELY LOSES TO DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arizona, ranked No. 21 and playing its third road game in five days, was tough 
against No. 3 Duke, but lost, 78-76, Sunday at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, which beat California and Stanford in the Bay Area on Thursday and 
Friday, outrebounded Duke, 45-23. 
</P>
<P>
"They owned the boards," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a lot of foul trouble, so we didn't always have a big lineup in 
there to combat them." 
</P>
<P>
The nonconference loss drops the Wildcats to 19-6 overall. They remain 12-3 in 
the Pacific 10. 
</P>
<P>
Duke guard Phil Henderson scored 28 points to lead the Blue Devils. He was 
coming off a four-for-18 shooting performance in Duke's 76-71 loss to North 
Carolina State last Wednesday. He hit 12 of 20 shots Sunday, and had 18 points 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona held a 70-69 edge with 3:43 left, but four consecutive free throws in a 
23-second span by Christian Laettner put Duke ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson sank two free throws to make it 77-74 with 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona got within two on a layup by Sean Rooks at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Abdelnaby scored 17 points before fouling out for Duke (23-5). The Blue Devils 
won their 56th consecutive nonconference game at home. 
</P>
<P>
For Arizona, Brian Williams had 19 points, Buechler scored 17, Rooks had 15 and 
Ed Stokes 13. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford 57, Arizona St. 44 -- Deshon Wingate scored 17 points and Adam Keefe 
added 16 to lead the Cardinal (16-9, 8-8) to a Pac-10 victory at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State (12-13, 5-10) made only seven of 22 shots in the first half to 
trail, 22-16. 
</P>
<P>
The 44 points is the fewest by a Stanford opponent this season. No Sun Devil 
had more than 12 points.

HOT-SHOOTING DUCKS SINK TROJANS, 96-79;

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: OREGON IS TALKING ABOUT A POSSIBLE NCAA BID AFTER MOVING 
INTO FOURTH PLACE IN THE PAC-10.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When his players offered only token resistance in the first half Sunday, 
falling behind Oregon by 13 points at McArthur Court, USC Coach George Raveling 
threw up his hands and threw away his chalk. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as soon as the startled Trojans reached the locker room at halftime, 
Raveling sent them back out onto the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a whole lot that could be corrected on the (chalk) board," 
Raveling explained. "What we needed was a change of mental attitude. We didn't 
need a change of strategy. We just needed some guys who wanted to play 
basketball. We didn't have any that wanted to play today." 
</P>
<P>
Even if it had, USC might not have been able to beat the surging Ducks, who 
made 62.3% of their shots and romped, 96-79, after making 65% of their shots 
last Thursday night in a 105-99 victory over UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Picked by several preseason publications to finish last in the Pacific 10 
Conference race, Oregon has won four consecutive games to improve to 15-10 
overall and move into fourth place in the conference at 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
And Coach Don Monson, who told his players that 15 wins would get them into the 
NIT, now has his sights on a grander prize. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been in the NIT before, but the way these kids are playing, let's look 
at the (NCAA) tournament," Monson said. "All I know is that you're at the mercy 
of the (selection) committee." 
</P>
<P>
USC (9-15, 4-12) was at the mercy of the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the previous 11 USC-Oregon games had been decided by four points or 
less, and Oregon had won the previous three on last-second shots, but this one 
was all but over midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Connecting on nine of their first 10 shots after halftime, the Ducks rolled out 
to a 73-49 lead with 13:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
USC cut its deficit to 10, but never got any closer. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting beat doesn't bother me nearly as much as how we got beat," Raveling 
said. "It seemed like we had no interest in playing the game. And based on how 
we'd been playing lately, this game was a total shock to me. It's got me 
puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we showed any enthusiasm to play. I don't think we showed any 
mental toughness. We didn't have any team play. It was just a total breakdown, 
and I don't know how to explain it because we had made such tremendous strides. 
Never in my life would I have thought we'd come in here and play like we 
played." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the Trojans' fourth in a row, but their previous three were by a 
total of 10 points, including a 98-94 overtime decision last Thursday night 
against conference-leading Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Keith Reynolds, playing his last game at McArthur Court, led 
Oregon with 26 points, making 12 of 16 shots. And sophomore guard Terrell 
Brandon, who scored a season-high 31 points against UCLA, contributed 25 points 
(on nine-of-13 shooting) and nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
But two other seniors, guard Steve Ranninger and forward Eric Dunn, provided as 
much drama for the crowd of 8,460. Monson, honoring a long-standing personal 
tradition, made them starters for their last home game, and each played well 
enough to merit a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
Ranninger, who had played fewer minutes than all but one other Duck, scored a 
season-high 11 points in 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
And Dunn, who lost his starting position to Bob Fife midway through the season, 
made five of six shots, scored 13 points, took six rebounds and passed for 
three assists in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner scored 18 points to pass Tom Lewis as USC's all-time leading 
freshman scorer. Miner has 488 points in 24 games. Lewis scored 475 points in 
the 1985-86 season before transferring to Pepperdine. . . . Miner needs 90 
points to break the Pac-10 freshman scoring record of 577 points, set last 
season by UCLA's Don MacLean. USC has at least three games remaining. . . . 
USC's Calvin Banks, a starter in all but one of USC's 23 games before Sunday, 
played only three minutes because of a pulled groin muscle. Banks was injured 
before Thursday night's game at Oregon State when he stepped on a television 
cable.

FLAMES SCORCH EDMONTON, 10-4

<TEXT>
<P>
There have been numerous times this season when the Calgary Flames have not 
looked the part of Stanley Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
They hit a low point early this month when the Kings, who have been bounced 
around recently by weaker teams, won back-to-back games against them. 
</P>
<P>
But the Flames are looking sharp again and were at their best Sunday night 
against the Edmonton Oilers at Calgary. The Flames scored three quick goals and 
vaulted into first place in the Smythe Division by overwhelming the Oilers, 
10-4. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Nieuwendyk, the Flames' leading scorer, had two goals to lead the assault. 
The Flames, who built a 6-1 lead in the first two periods, fired 45 shots. They 
moved in front, 10-2, before the Oilers scored the last two goals of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Pokey Reddick, who has played so well in the absence of the Oilers' two top 
goalies, Grant Fuhr and Bill Ranford, was the victim. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, who have played one less game than the Oilers, lead the Oilers by 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday the Flames put on another powerful offensive display, smashing 
Toronto, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 3, New Jersey 3 -- How much do the Islanders miss their 
injured offensive star Pat LaFontaine? 
</P>
<P>
Gary Nylund, a 6-4 defenseman, is now the star of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Before LaFontaine, who scored 48 goals in 62 games, chipped a bone in his left 
hand Thursday night, Nylund had not scored a goal this season. 
</P>
<P>
He has three in the two games LaFontaine has missed. LaFontaine is expected to 
be out at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night Nylund, who scored 25 goals in his first 500 NHL games, ended 
the Islanders' six-game winless string by scoring the tying goal, late in the 
game against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Uniondale, N.Y., Nylund scored the first goal, with eight 
seconds left in the first period. He also scored the last one with 50 seconds 
left in regulation to give the Islanders their second tie in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back ties have put the Islanders only one point behind the New York 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Winnipeg 1 -- Clint Malarchuk stopped 37 shots at Buffalo and the 
Sabres held onto second place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk was at his best in the last two periods, stopping all 28 shots the 
Jets tried. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Vaive scored what proved to be the winning goal in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, St. Louis 5 -- Russ Courtnall scored at 3:05 of overtime at 
Montreal to lead the Canadiens to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens built a 5-2 lead, but Brett Hull rallied the Blues late in the 
second period with his 60th goal. 
</P>
<P>
After Gino Cavallini cut the Montreal lead to a goal early in the last period, 
Hull, with less than five minutes left in regulation, scored his 61st to tie 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 9, Detroit 4 -- This spirited offensive display by the Capitals at 
Landover, Md. really tightened the Patrick race. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hunter, Mike Ridley and Dino Ciccarelli each scored twice and the Capitals 
moved into a tie with Philadelphia for fifth place. With 58 points, they are 
only seven points behind the division-leading Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals had blown third period leads in three of their previous six games, 
but didn't falter when the Red Wings' Gerard Gallant cut the lead to two early 
in the last period. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after scoring his 51st goal in the second period, Steve Yzerman was hit 
in the foot with a puck and had to leave. Earlier Steve Chiasson also was hit 
in the foot and departed. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Dirk Graham scored twice and the Blackhawks took 
apart the NHL's best penalty-killing unit in this game at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers entered the game having killed off 83.9% of the oppositions power 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
But they lost this one when Steve Thomas and Graham scored in the second period 
when the Hawks had a man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first loss this season for goaltender Ron Hextall in just his fifth 
game. DAN HAFNER

Don Bies set the pace with his three-under-par 69 as the United States rallied 
from a slow start Sunday at Sarasota, Fla., to win its third consecutive 
Chrysler Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. seniors beat the International team in four of eight final-round 
matches and tied three for a 53.5-30.5 victory at the Tournament Players Club 
at Prestancia. 
</P>
<P>
The Internationals began the day needing to win five matches for a victory, but 
they won only one. 
</P>
<P>
The first seven U.S. players to tee off bogeyed the opening hole. That included 
Bies, who quickly fell two shots behind Roberto DeVicenzo in the first match of 
the day but rallied with five birdies to win, 69-72. 
</P>
<P>
In the second twosome, Dave Hill of the United States had three birdies in the 
final seven holes to beat Bob Charles, 70-72. 
</P>
<P>
The other U.S. winners were Lee Trevino, who breezed past Peter Thomson, 69-83, 
and Chi Chi Rodriguez, who beat Billy Dunk, 73-77. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Green shot a one-over-par 72 on the Royal Hong Kong golf course and won the 
Hong Kong Open by four strokes.

Green, a Ryder Cup player from West Palm Springs, Fla., had a tournament total 
of eight-under par 205 in the 54-hole tournament that was shortened because of 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
Tied for second at 209 were Brian Watts and Danny Mijovic of Canada. They also 
shared the day's best score at four-under-par 67.

STANFORD WINS 4TH CONSECUTIVE WOMEN'S TITLE

<P>
The Stanford women's swimming team won four more events Sunday night to seal 
their fourth consecutive Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championship at 
the East Los Angeles College Pool. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford totaled 1,717 points. California finished second with 1,238, followed 
by UCLA (1,143), Arizona State (1,075) and USC (936). 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's first victory came in the first event when freshman Janet Evans 
lapped the field in the 1,650-yard freestyle, setting a conference record of 
15:53.77. 
</P>
<P>
Although victories are almost becoming routine for Evans, who had won two 
events in earlier sessions, she was excited by her effort. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to go under 16 minutes and I was very happy to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Susannah Miller, a Stanford senior, led a Cardinal sweep in the 200-yard 
backstroke. Miller, who touched with an NCAA qualifying time of 2:01.29, was 
followed by Jody Smith and Dede Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Stoudt, a sophomore at UCLA, won the 100-yard freestyle with a 
conference record of 49.93. Michelle Thompson of Arizona State was second. 
</P>
<P>
Stoudt, who won the 50-yard freestyle Friday night, swam her best time ever. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to break 50 seconds," Stoudt said. "I'm confident going to NCAA's 
because I know I can go faster." 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, the 200-yard breaststroke, Stanford freshman Lori Heisick 
led from the beginning on the way to her second championship with a time of 
2:15.82. Her teammates, Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert, were second and 
third, respectively. Heisick won the 100-yard breaststroke Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's final victory came when freshman Janel Jorgensen joined Evans as a 
three-event winner with a victory in the 200-yard butterfly. Jorgensen's time 
of 1:58.75 was just off Mary T. Meagher's conference record of 1:57.4, but well 
under the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen was happy with the victory, but had hoped for Meagher's record. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about the record, but I wasn't sure if I could get it tonight," 
Jorgensen said. "We'll see, with a couple of weeks of rest, whether I can get 
her other marks." 
</P>
<P>
Meagher also holds the American records in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly 
events. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA added another championship by winning the 400-yard freestyle relay with a 
time of 3:23.29. Stanford was second and USC third. All three teams qualified 
for the NCAA championships to be held March 15-17 at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
For Stanford, the relay was merely icing on the cake. Stanford, the defending 
national champion, is top-ranked this year, and after this weekend's 
performances is in good position to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
For UCLA and USC, the result of the relay was a great way to end the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great Pac-10's," UCLA Coach Cyndi Gallagher said. "The last relay 
just topped it off." 
</P>

CLIMBER LOSES GRIP ON RESCUER, DIES IN FALL

A 22-year-old hiker plummeted 125 feet to his death after losing his grip on a 
"human chain" that was attempting to rescue him from a steep cliff in Angeles 
National Forest, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Anthony Grijalva of Los Angeles was killed Saturday afternoon while 
climbing up the cliff beside Switzer Falls in the mountains north of La Canada 
Flintridge, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Grijalva had already fallen once into a shallow pond at the foot of the cliff 
and was trying to rejoin his friends at the top of the falls when he fell a 
second time, said Sgt. Greg McHenry of the Sheriff's Department's Crescenta 
Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses said Grijalva fell at least 70 feet the first time, but was 
uninjured and started scaling the mountain again. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was OK and he was going to come back up, and then we saw him 
climbing up the cliff, straight up," said Mark Grabfelder, 19, of Glendale, who 
was at the waterfall with three other friends. 
</P>
<P>
When Grijalva became stuck near the top, he called for the other hikers to help 
him up. "He was gripping the dirt. He said, 'Please help me,' " said John 
Lambert, also from Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Grabfelder said he and another friend formed a human chain to try to rescue 
Grijalva. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he might pull us over with him, but I sat down and gave him my leg 
so he could pull himself up," Grabfelder said. "He grabbed my shoe but then he 
started to slip. I heard him scream and we watched him fall." 
</P>
<P>
Grijalva was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said the mountain was 
decomposed granite that looks stable, but gives way easily. 
</P>
<P>
Grabfelder was shaken after the unsuccessful rescue effort. "I was almost too 
scared to climb across the rocks to go back to the car," Grabfelder said.

TOWNHOUSE FIRE KILLS WOMAN, 88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 88-year-old woman died Saturday night in a fire at her Thousand Oaks 
townhouse, Ventura County fire officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
The woman lived alone and was not identified pending notification of her 
family. 
</P>
<P>
She was found dead in the living room in the 1000 block of Glenbridge Circle, 
where the fire was reported at 10:15 p.m., fire dispatcher Annie Ironside said. 
Authorities said the woman had been smoking and they believe that was the cause 
of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started in the living room and spread to the townhouse next door 
through a common attic, causing $125,000 worth of damage to each unit, Ironside 
said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries to the next-door neighbors. It took about 55 
firefighters 35 minutes to control the blaze.

GEORGIAN TROUPE OUT TO RECONQUER S.D. AUDIENCES;

DANCE: RUSTAVI COMPANY'S DISTINCTIVE STYLE SPURS STRONG ADVANCE SALE OF TICKETS 
FOR SYMPHONY HALL PERFORMANCES.

The indigenous dances of Soviet Georgia are as unlike other forms of dance as 
they can be. Where else will you find men -- not women -- performing brazen 
athletics on pointe? Or courting couples dancing without any physical contact? 
</P>
<P>
"Georgian dances are very different," Anzor Erkomaishvili, artistic director of 
the Rustavi Company, acknowledged by phone from the touring trail. "But 
Georgian songs are even more different from other cultures than its dances." 
</P>
<P>
Many San Diegans discovered this unique art form just last fall when the Soviet 
Arts Festival featured several performances of dance and song from Soviet 
Georgia. This week, another profusion of Georgian folk expressions is headed 
our way, compliments of La Jolla-based International Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
The Rustavi Company, one of Soviet Georgia's leading song and dance ensembles, 
will make its local debut Tuesday evening at Symphony Hall, where it will 
continue to showcase authentic Georgian folk forms for eight performances 
through March 4. 
</P>
<P>
According to International Attractions President Don Hughes, ticket sales are 
hot, despite the abundance of Georgian dance dispensed during the recent Soviet 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had an amazing advance," Hughes said, "a 20% overall advance sales a 
week before the opening, and the first performance almost sold out already." 
</P>
<P>
How does Hughes explain this phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people didn't get in to see the Georgian dancers at the festival," he 
said, "and a lot who did get in want to see more." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Corcoran, executive director of the San Diego Area Dance Alliance (local 
sponsor of the Soviet Arts Festival's Georgian dance group) is not a bit 
surprised at the overwhelming response. 
</P>
<P>
"(Georgian dance) was the most appreciated we've ever had here," he said. 
"People who wouldn't dream of attending ballet or modern dance were there. We 
had nine performances, and they were all sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we could have added almost nine more shows. We had to add extra 
performances (even before the scheduled opening) and they were sold out in 
about 12 hours. And the year before there was a national Georgian ensemble at 
the Civic Theater, and they sold even more seats than we had available," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Erkomaishvili and his ensemble have been performing in the United States since 
the end of January. And the troupe has experienced the same kind of 
enthusiastic response. Chalk some of that up to curiosity about a little known 
cultural expression and the people who created it. 
</P>
<P>
But the uniqueness of the art form is the major attraction to American 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Erkomaishvili has a ready answer for the obvious question: How did the Georgian 
people develop such an iconoclastic style of dance? 
</P>
<P>
"The reason is in our nature and character. The dances mirror our way of life. 
Georgia is sort of an island in the surrounding world. The Georgian spirit is 
completely different from other nations. And everything in our history and our 
lives is reflected in Georgian dance. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see Georgian dance, you see a lot of different parts of Georgian 
life," he explained, "military dances, couples dances, humorous dances. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Erkomaishvili is stumped for an explanation of why the Georgian songs -- dating 
back 2,000 years -- are so sophisticated. All he can say is "the ancient 
Georgians were ahead of their time, just like some philosophers. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing about the songs, are the extremely developed 
polyphony," Erkomaishvili noted. "Stravinsky once said, 'Georgian folk music 
has more new musical ideas than all the contemporary music.' For him, Georgian 
music was one of the biggest delights in his life." 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said for Erkomaishvili, the seventh generation in a dynasty of 
singers and folklorists. As a result, the director has put a premium on 
collecting and preserving the ancient songs of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Rescuing the ancient songs from oblivion was his primary motivation for 
founding the Rustavi song and dance troupe in the late 1960s. And the zealous 
Erkomaishvili has obviously been successful. Since starting his quest, he has 
recorded more than 200 obscure folk songs for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many folk dance companies in Soviet Georgia," he said, "so the 
dances were being preserved. But many of the traditional songs were not." 
</P>
<P>
Dance still plays the major role in Rustavi concerts, and according to reviews 
of their performances, the energetic dancers deliver the goods with laudable 
virtuosity. Macho men pounce up vigorously on their black-booted toes, then 
come crashing down for a powerful landing on their knees -- only to repeat the 
punishing cycle again at breakneck speed. 
</P>
<P>
The men also take center stage with daredevil displays of swordplay that look 
menacingly real (and have resulted in a few injuries during the tour). Like 
their Russian counterparts, the Georgians can spin at dizzying speeds, leap 
through the air like demons, and maneuver through myriad bravura feats. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, Georgian women dance demurely. They glide across the floor 
effortlessly, their steps so tiny and invisible the dancers appear to be 
skimming the the stage. Other cultures now feature this serene style of 
dancing, but nowhere else has it reached such a pinnacle, except in Georgian 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
When the women team up with the men, they never touch. It's part of the 
Georgian tradition. And as Erkomaishvili noted: 
</P>
<P>
"When you see them dance, you might not think the women are as important, but 
everything the men do is to impress the women. The dances express the Georgian 
attitude toward women -- that women are something sacred," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Art, entertainment, and spectacle blend in the Rustavi Company's colorful 
production numbers -- all brilliantly costumed according to tradition. And that 
has been a winning combination everywhere the troupe performs. But Georgian 
folk forms tap a deeper source in American audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans love it because it's pure folklore -- a pure people's art," he 
stressed, "and it's very old. America is a young nation, and they're interested 
in things that are very old."

SCHWARZ SAVES THE DAY WITH 'GURRELIEDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not every conductor knows the "Gurrelieder." Arnold Schoenberg's youthful 
masterpiece -- possibly the last sprawling, monumental, super-emotional, 
resoundingly poetic gasp of a romanticism in decay -- isn't exactly regarded as 
standard repertory. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, one gets to hear the work more and more these days. The Los Angeles 
Philharmonic ventured it under Zubin Mehta in 1968 and 1977. Even Keith Clark 
and the Pacific Symphony in Orange County had a stab at it in 1988. Still, the 
composer's lofty, indulgent rhetoric and the Gargantuan forces needed to convey 
that rhetoric remain prohibitive in most quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The number of major conductors who happen to know the "Gurrelieder" is small. 
One thinks of Seiji Ozawa, Pierre Boulez and Herbert Blomstedt, in addition to 
Mehta, for starters. The number of major conductors who know the "Gurrelieder" 
and might be available to take over a performance at a short notice is 
laughably smaller. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Philharmonic found this out last week when Andre Previn 
canceled his scheduled commitment here. Reportedly a victim of the flu, our 
beleaguered ex-music director left the management with a sprawling, monumental 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, cancellation of the Schoenberg performances seemed the only 
sensible hope for relief. Then someone remembered Gerard Schwarz, the 
celebrated and -- more important -- versatile music-director of the Seattle 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that he had never conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic -- he had 
spent his years here at the helm of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Never 
mind that he had ventured the "Gurrelieder" only once before, and that was some 
20 years ago at the Juilliard School of Music. Never mind that he would have 
only four days of rehearsal. Never mind that he was off on a much wanted 
vacation, skiing with his family in some vaguely inaccessible locale. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarz happens to be a musician who thrives on unlikely challenges. He doesn't 
like to just say no. 
</P>
<P>
He thrived emphatically on this challenge. Friday night at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion, he led a performance of the "Gurrelieder" that was neat and logical 
at worst, assertive and insightful at best. Just in case Los Angeles was still 
wondering, he proved that he can think big. 
</P>
<P>
It would be less than realistic to pretend that he has grasped every subtle 
inflection of the piece overnight. It will take time for him to fill in all the 
blanks, to make a profoundly personal statement in this complex and often 
evasive music. 
</P>
<P>
Some listeners could argue that he began the marathon rather tentatively, that 
once in a while he would bury the singers under the thick orchestral blanket, 
that he sometimes slighted the transitional dynamics or that he occasionally 
rushed needlessly toward cadences. He really did blow the climactic summer 
wind, for instance, into a mighty storm. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Even at this early stage, he exerted fine technical control and 
demonstrated a keen understanding of the inherent structural problems. He 
savored the cumulative tensions of the piece, appreciated the crucial 
difference between pathos and sentimentality, between power and bombast. 
</P>
<P>
He offered enlightened, essentially authoritative music-making on a properly 
heroic scale. He coaxed brilliant playing from a decisively sympathetic, 
eminently cooperative orchestra. He certainly has earned a return engagement 
under more comfortable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, he inherited a splendid ensemble of soloists, three of them holdovers 
from Mehta's last "Gurrelieder." Jessye Norman sang the tragic rhapsodies of 
Tove with uncommonly lush tone and sweeping ecstasy. Florence Quivar brought 
otherworldly pathos to the song of the Wood-Dove. Hans Hotter, now 81 and still 
revered as the greatest Wotan of his time, once again burst the confines of 
Sprechgesang with the passionate poignance of his "Summer Wind" narration. 
</P>
<P>
Like most tenors -- helden or human -- Gary Lakes found the ascending outbursts 
of Waldemar an unreasonable strain. He compensated, however, with forthright 
lyricism wherever possible. 
</P>
<P>
James Johnson was the rather muffled Peasant. David Gordon managed the plaints 
of Klaus the Fool pointedly, a sinus infection notwithstanding. The Los Angeles 
Master Chorale and the Pacific Chorale fused to make an appropriately mighty 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
The large, appreciative audience followed the printed text dutifully. 
Unfortunately, the management made the mistake of providing an uncredited, 
inaccurate and all-too-liberal libretto. This padded translation obviously was 
intended to be sung, not to be read.

THE BIG SURPRISE AT ORBISON TRIBUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me. ..." 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman didn't catch anyone off guard 
when they began singing that Bob Dylan song during a mini-Byrds reunion 
Saturday night at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Tambourine Man" was the Byrds' first hit, and it remains the tune most 
identified with the landmark Los Angeles folk-rock group from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
But there were gasps of surprise and delight during the four-hour Roy Orbison 
tribute concert when the threesome was joined half-way through the song by a 
surprise guest . . . Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
It was, Dylan said after the concert, the first time he had appeared with the 
three Byrds since the band, then a quintet, was making rock history by forging 
its new sound 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite extensive touring in recent years, Dylan continues to bring a sense of 
drama with him every time he walks on stage, and he did so again Saturday as he 
first shared a microphone with Crosby, then with McGuinn. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing dark glasses, a white jacket and black trousers, rock's most acclaimed 
songwriter remained on stage while McGuinn moved into "He Was a Friend of 
Mine," another Byrds favorite. McGuinn dedicated the song to Orbison, the 
classic rock singer and songwriter who died in 1988 at the height of a dramatic 
comeback that included his work with Dylan and others in the Traveling Wilburys 
supergroup. 
</P>
<P>
The four musicians were then joined by about four dozen other members of the 
evening's large cast to close the benefit concert with Orbison's signature 
song, "Only the Lonely." The organizers of the concert hope the show and an 
upcoming cable-TV special will raise about $3 million for homeless 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Dylan-Byrds appearance will likely be the most treasured moment of 
the cable special that is planned for this spring by Showtime, there were 
numerous other emotional highlights sprinkled in the program. 
</P>
<P>
They included k.d. lang's show-stopping rendition of Orbison's "Crying," Dean 
Stockwell's re-creation of his eerie, unsettling lip-syncing rendition of "In 
Dreams" from the film "Blue Velvet" and the first performance by Bonnie Raitt 
since winning four Grammys on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fitting first outing for Raitt because she, much like Orbison, has 
rallied against career disappointment to achieve renewed commercial and 
critical acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
While the 40-year-old singer didn't fall as far from the spotlight as Orbison 
did during the '70s and early '80s, there were questions about her future after 
she was dropped in 1986 by her longtime record company, Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
But Raitt bounced back last year with "Nick of Time," which earned her a Grammy 
for album of the year. Rather than sing the album's title track Saturday, Raitt 
dueted with John Lee Hooker on their Grammy-winning "I'm in the Mood," then 
sang a tune identified with Orbison, the rowdy, energetic "Candy Man." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the evening's performances captured various aspects of Orbison's 
musical spirit, including the rockabilly zest of John Fogerty's "Ooby Dooby," 
the romantic paranoia of Benny Mardones' "Running Scared" and the sweet dream 
portrait of Chris Isaak's "Leah." 
</P>
<P>
But it was perhaps Raitt who best conveyed Orbison's sense of dignity -- the 
respect he had for music that was from the heart rather than music that was 
manufactured for the charts; a respect that made him feel part of a musical 
community that could use its power to help others rather than just celebrate 
his own accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
It was in that spirit that Raitt accepted her Grammys on behalf of all the 
blues artists who had inspired her and spoke backstage Saturday about the need 
for more blues and other roots-related music on mainstream radio. 
</P>
<P>
On a purely musical level, there were problems with the Amphitheatre concert, 
many of them tied to a cast that included some singers and, especially, actors 
who are severely mismatched when trying to compete against the memory of one of 
rock's greatest singers ever. No one, for instance, is ever going to ask Gary 
Busey to play the lead in "The Roy Orbison Story." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the generous parade of performers added to the sense of community that is 
becoming an increasingly prominent and rewarding part of the pop landscape. 
Plus, the fact that artists as varied as Emmylou Harris, John Hiatt, Booker T. 
Jones, Joe Ely, Cindy Bullens, Michael McDonald and members of the Talking 
Heads can find common ground in the music of a single writer also underscores 
the richness and range of Orbison's grand musical legacy.

Pacific Symphony to Name New Conductor: The Pacific Symphony is expected to 
announce its new conductor and music director in a press conference this 
morning. Carl St. Clair, one of two assistant conductors of the Boston 
Symphony, has been a leading contender for the position, but officials would 
not confirm over the weekend that he would be named. St. Clair emerged as a top 
contender after leading a pair of critically and publicly well-received 
subscription concerts Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. The previous front-runner, Lawrence 
Foster, revealed earlier this month that the orchestra had offered him the 
music director job in December but later withdrew the offer after talks broke 
down. St. Clair has said he would consider moving to Orange County if offered 
the job. BETH KLEID

Crocodile Dundee Calls It a G'Day: Paul Hogan has thrown his last shrimp on the 
barbie. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian star of the " 'Crocodile' Dundee" films has decided he's tired 
of saying "G'day" to the world and inviting tourists to visit Down Under for a 
bit of outdoor seafood dining. The Australian Tourist Commission said Friday 
the former Sydney Harbor Bridge riggerhad quit the television commercials shown 
all over the world. The Hogan commercials lured an estimated 250,000 Americans 
to Australia since they began in 1984. They'll be withdrawn from American 
television screens on March 13. BETH KLEID

Rocky Loses to Museum: It looks as if Rocky Balboa has lost his bout with the 
Philadelphia Museum of Art. The 8-foot, 6-inch statue of the fictional South 
Philadelphia palooka is scheduled to leave its spot atop the art museum's steps 
today for its former home at the Spectrum arena, a museum spokeswoman said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The statue of Rocky was moved from the Spectrum for the filming of "Rocky V." 
The film's producers had agreed to put the statue back when they were through, 
but Sylvester Stallone and Rocky fans tried to persuade the museum to keep it 
on the spot made famous in the original "Rocky." But art museum officials say 
it's out of place in front of the Greco-Roman building. BETH KLEID

ANTHRAX TURNS SHOW INTO SLAM DANCE PIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthrax is the speed-metal band your parents might not mind your listening to, 
a bunch of regular guys who wear jams, read Mad and watch "Yo! MTV Raps" just 
like any other teen-age kids, guys who write songs about Indian rights and the 
homeless instead of about Satan or sexist love. They're not half so into the 
apocalypse as other headbangers -- and their audiences tend to slam-dance 
instead of brood. 
</P>
<P>
Anthrax, in town to record their fourth album, played a show at the Troubadour 
Friday to test some new songs in front of a live audience. Anthrax usually 
plays arenas; to speed-metal fans, scamming a ticket to the last-minute gig was 
like their parents' getting in to see Springsteen at the Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
It's less accurate to say that a slam pit formed than that the entire club 
turned into a slam pit, bodies thrashing, one small fellow turning repeated 
back-flips off the stage, a sump of sweat and beer. Half the audience hummed 
the guitar leads, chanted along with the words, even on Anthrax's rap song, "I 
Am the Man," which never made it onto an album. It was strictly unnecessary for 
the rest of the band to join in on the choruses. The audience participation was 
less on the new songs -- Joey Belladonna constantly apologized for them. "Yo. I 
promise. When it's on the album, you'll like it," he said. JONATHAN GOLD

SATIRIST STAN FREBERG RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Freberg, the free-form satirist who first caught the national ear with his 
wonderfully spoofy radio shows and then proved that chow mein commercials could 
be funny, returns to radio today. He makes his debut as a commentator in some 
amusing if non-poisonous 90-second sound bites on KNX-AM (1070) locally and in 
syndication nationally. 
</P>
<P>
The strip, called "Stan Freberg Here," will air four times daily on KNX at 4:42 
a.m. and p.m. and at 11:42 a.m. and p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Freberg's early targets and tangents include some recent deformations of 
language ("My son Donovan asked if he could access the butter"); an interview 
with George Washington about his upset at becoming only half of a national 
holiday; the rash of substitutes for fur and leather apparel, including 
salmon-skin shoes and wallets that start swimming upstream if you fall in the 
water; a newly unemployed spy (in the wake of glasnost) opening a shop for 
surplus espionage gear, Spies R Us, and so on in the cheeky, chirpy Freberg 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Like any strip, it is likely to have its ups and down, and 90 seconds doesn't 
give a chap much room to get running. But on the early evidence, Freberg is in 
fine, irreverent form, with the occasional sharp sting of "Gotcha!" CHARLES 
CHAMPLIN

'TOO YOUNG TO DIE?' DRAMATIZES TEEN DEATH SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The murder in the oil fields in "Too Young to Die?" (at 9 tonight on Channels 
4, 36 and 39) is a wrenching catharsis, directed and acted with such veracity 
that it leaves you pale. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tough but dramatically viable scene, not for any blood you see but for 
its emotional terror. You are that bound-up victim facing the crazed, 
knife-wielding 15-year-old girl and her scuzzy boyfriend. For a funny second, 
too, you are that girl with murder in her heart. 
</P>
<P>
Everything in this excellent teleplay by David Hill and George Rubino (from a 
story by Hill, inspired by an actual crime in Oklahoma) moves toward and away 
from this central murder scene. The power of the show derives from the 
compelling script, from the taut framing of director Robert Markowitz, and from 
Juliette Lewis' authentic portrayal of the young and abused murderess whose 
first question to her public defender ("L.A. Law's" Michael Tucker) is whether 
he has any sugar-coated candies. 
</P>
<P>
The production is hard as a cue ball -- no distracting subplots, no wasted 
motion. It's a story full of squalor and tacky trailer courts and cackling 
yahoos, dives, sex and drugs, and how all of these things determine the fate of 
this abandoned girl, even when she meets a genuine Prince Charming (Michael 
O'Keefe). 
</P>
<P>
The film makers aren't debating capital punishment but they are dramatizing a 
rigorous question: Should minors guilty of capital crimes be sentenced to 
death? The deck is not stacked too high in favor of the girl, either. That's 
why that brutal murder scene (charged by the feral performance of the girl's 
scumbag accomplice, played by Brad Pitt) is so agonizingly staged and so 
crucial to the theme. 
</P>
<P>
A postscript pointedly reports that the Supreme Court last year decided to give 
states the right to put minors to death who are 16 or older and who have 
committed capital crimes. The last words on the screen tell us that 26 
teen-agers are currently on Death Row in this country. RAY LOYND

MOTHER STRUGGLES TO SAVE DAUGHTER FROM STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Daughter of the Streets" is a melodrama about a teen-ager who is lured into 
hooking when family pressures become unmanageable. Later, in a mindless twist, 
she is kidnaped by her family and tied to her bed to bring her back to her 
senses (at 9 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
The story, supposedly based on a real-life mother's ordeal, is pretty absurd. 
As the social-activist mother who is blind to her daughter's needs, Jane 
Alexander is stuck with a self-righteous character who is hard to take when 
she's selfish and even harder to take when she's struggling to save her 
daughter from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
As the teen-ager turned off by her mother's ferocious, 1960s' idealism, not to 
mention her mom's cavalier dishonesty with creditors, Roxana Zal is fine until 
she hits the hard streets and turns tart. 
</P>
<P>
Her transition from decent, caring high school senior to whore is not 
sufficiently motivated, and her aggressive whoring is never convincing. (Zal is 
too preppie, Bryn Mawr-looking to get away with this role; in contrast, all the 
other hookers on the street are perfect casting). 
</P>
<P>
A surprisingly good characterization, despite its cliches, is delivered by the 
silken, smooth, pimp-perfect John Stamos. But the script by David Abramowitz is 
trite and the girl's kidnapping, complete with police barging in to rescue her 
from her own well-meaning family, is directed in overdrive by Ed Sherin. The 
show tries to be both lurid and human and winds up, at best, an ordinary, 
forgettable drama. RAY LOYND

Driven by a rare chance for permission to build homes in this scenic ski and 
gambling resort, about 140 people spent a fourth day camped outside the city 
library in snow and sub-zero temperatures. The would-be builders -- some 
huddled in crudely built igloos and snow caves -- held their ground even though 
the county government Friday withdrew a plan to issue 123 coveted permits on a 
first-come, first-served basis this morning. A smaller contingent waited 
outside City Hall, hoping for a chance at a separate batch of permits 
controlled by the city government.

L.A. COUNCIL ALREADY IS HIGHEST-PAID IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
CITY HALL: COUNCILMEN DEFEND REQUEST FOR A $33,000 PAY HIKE. BUT CRITICS SAY 
THAT IS ASKING FOR TOO MUCH AT THE WRONG TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council, which is seeking a nearly $33,000-a-year pay 
raise, already is the highest paid city council in the country, according to a 
Times survey. 
</P>
<P>
If voters approve a June ballot measure, annual salaries for the 15 council 
members will rise to $94,344 -- more than many big-city mayors and all but five 
governors. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, for example, makes $80,000 a year, 
and Gov. George Deukmejian receives $85,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the 53% pay raise, however, council members will be making less than 
dozens of Los Angeles city workers and department heads. Top police and fire 
officials make more than $90,000 a year. The head of the Department of Airports 
is paid $160,087, the city's highest annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
In light of such city salaries and pay rates in private industry, some council 
members believe that they are underpaid at $61,522 a year. During recent debate 
on the issue, Councilman Joel Wachs suggested that he and his colleagues would 
be content with the hourly wages of a plumber. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the council wants to be paid as much as Superior Court judges, who 
make $94,344 a year. The pay of Los Angeles County supervisors already is tied 
to that of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
The public will be asked to vote on the council's request as part of a complex 
ethics reform package that includes public financing of political campaigns, a 
ban on outside work and honorariums, and restrictions on gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Backers and opponents say the measure's success will hinge on whether voters 
want to approve substantial pay raises for city elected officials, including 
the mayor, city attorney and controller. 
</P>
<P>
Council members and others say the raises are deserved and long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Arch Hardyment, executive director of L.A. Tax, a business association 
concerned with city and county fiscal matters, said last week that council 
members probably are underpaid and a raise may be merited. 
</P>
<P>
"To attract high-quality people to run for (the council), it will have to be a 
little bit higher paying than it is now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Victor Tabbush, chairman of the city's salary commission, is troubled by 
the amount of the council's pay request. 
</P>
<P>
"It was highly irresponsible of the council to ignore the recommendation of the 
official salary authority," said Tabbush, assistant dean of the UCLA Graduate 
School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
Tabbush headed the city commission that last year recommended raising council 
pay to the level of Municipal Court judges, who now get $86,156 a year. That 
amounts to $8,188 less than the council is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to be able to offer salaries that would attract qualified 
people," he said. "Tying it to Municipal Court judge was on the generous side." 
</P>
<P>
The original ethics proposal -- crafted by Councilman Michael Woo and a 
commission appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley -- did not include a pay raise. The 
salary increase was added last month by the council during debate on the ethics 
package. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Cowan, head of the mayor's ethics commission, has said he supports a 
pay raise but fears that such a steep raise could defeat the entire measure. 
</P>
<P>
In arguing for higher salaries, City Council President John Ferraro has pointed 
out that some 1,500 city workers make more than the council. Included are 
dozens of police lieutenants, captains, commanders and deputy chiefs, fire 
department captains, battalion chiefs, assistant chiefs and deputy chiefs, as 
well as upper-level administrators in many departments. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ferraro said last week he may change his mind and vote for a lower pay 
raise when the ethics package comes before the council for a final time 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think I keep an open mind," Ferraro said. "I could change my mind. 
This is something the whole council has to look at." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said late last week that the council might reduce the size of its pay 
request to make it more palatable to voters. "I think there is a desire on the 
part of the majority of the council to see this package pass," he said. "A 
majority will not want the salary issue to be the major obstacle." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of whether the council gets the raise, the members will continue to 
get substantial perquisites, including seven city cars per council office, two 
or three free offices at City Hall and in their districts, and annual budgets 
of nearly $700,000 a year. Council members are free to decide how to spend 
their allotments and most hire staffs of a dozen or more. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities generally do not pay for district offices and few provide more 
than one car per council member, according to a Times survey of the seven most 
populous cities in the country and other data. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Colby, research director of City &amp; State, a trade newspaper for 
government officials, recently completed a national survey of city, county and 
state pay levels. She said that the perquisites and staffing budgets received 
by Los Angeles City Council members are "really amazing. . . . City councilmen 
in other places get nothing; maybe some staff, but no cars." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Los Angeles, The Times found, the highest paid council members are 
in Detroit, where the salary is $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
New York's 35 council members get a base pay of $55,000 a year. The council 
speaker gets $90,000 and two committee chairmen get $77,500, but New York 
council members generally earn less than their Los Angeles counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia pays its 17 council members $40,000 a year. Houston, which has a 
part-time council, pays its 14 members $34,800. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago's 50 aldermen get $40,000 a year. San Diego's eight council members get 
$45,000, and the mayor, who serves on the council, gets an additional $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Erlewine, a spokeswoman for the League of California Cities, suggested 
that Los Angeles council members, as leaders in the state's largest city, may 
merit higher pay than officials elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more cities are interested in (properly) compensating their elected 
folks," she said. "City government is becoming so much more complex that it 
takes a lot more time than it did 15 or 20 years ago. Most citizens do not 
understand what it takes to be a local elected official." 
</P>
<P>
That view is shared by Councilwoman Joy Picus, who argues that the Los Angeles 
City Council has far greater responsibility for the day-to-day city business 
than do councils in other large cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago City Council meets only twice a month, while Los Angeles council 
members meet three times a week; each of Chicago's 50 aldermen represents far 
fewer constituents than do Los Angeles' 15 council members. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more responsibility and have full-time jobs," Picus said. "I think we 
do as much constituent work easily as a congressional office." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said the Los Angeles council has far greater 
responsibility than New York's council for the administration of city 
government, including planning and zoning matters. A court-ordered 
reorganization of New York city government will expand the size and 
responsibilities of its council. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said that he believes the Los Angeles council is underpaid but 
"couldn't have picked a worse time to try and get approval for a pay raise." 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the ethics problems that have rocked this city in the last 10 
months, it's going to be very difficult to convince voters that the mayor in 
particular and elected officials in general are worthy of an increase."

PRESERVATIONISTS AND DISNEY IN TUG OF WAR OVER THE EL CAPITAN

<P>
Hillsman Wright was exploring the attic of the former 1920s-era El Capitan 
Theater on Hollywood Boulevard one afternoon last fall when he happened across 
a hole in the floor. Flashlight in hand, Wright lowered himself into a cramped 
cavern suspended high above the orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing himself on struts and support wires, Wright aimed the light at an 
arch of ornate plaster sandwiched between the attic and the suspended ceiling 
below. His discovery was a preservationist's dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that this theater was imminently restorable," Wright said of the 
decorative East Indian-style auditorium, which had featured live performances 
by such Hollywood stars as Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth before being converted 
into a television studio and later a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
But what was obvious to Wright, president of the Los Angeles Historic Theater 
Foundation, was far less evident to his hosts that day, officials of the 
distribution arm of the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Vista Pictures Distribution Co. and Pacific Theaters Corp., which leases 
the building from the landowner, had invited Wright to the 65-year-old theater 
to show him their plans for an upbeat Art Deco-style flagship for new Disney 
movie releases. The opening would be the premiere of the much ballyhooed "Dick 
Tracy" in June. 
</P>
<P>
The plans left no room for a restored auditorium, which Disney has said needs 
to be "more fun" and "more entertaining" than its intricate cast-plaster 
patterns and columns. The building's unusual exterior would be preserved, but 
the 1,500-seat auditorium would be broken into two theaters, with the original 
design -- including the massive arch stretching above the stage -- buried 
beneath a streamlined gypsum-board facade. 
</P>
<P>
Wright is not alone in his love for the original designs of San Francisco 
architect G. Albert Lansburgh. A small group of preservationists and community 
activists want to see the El Capitan restored in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
But Disney is irritated by the criticism, according to sources, and last week 
company officials let it be known that they may walk away from their El Capitan 
plans because of the resistance they have encountered. Meanwhile, the project 
could be stalled by questions raised by the city's Cultural Heritage 
Commission, which is to decide this week whether the proposed make-over 
conforms to federal restoration standards. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's interest in languishing Hollywood Boulevard has had boosters of the 
once-glorious cinema capital grinning from ear to ear. City officials have 
struggled for years to re-establish the boulevard as the world's premier center 
for movie palaces, and they see Disney as their ticket to Tomorrowland. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the prospect of Disney giving up on its Hollywood plans has set off a 
flurry of activity at City Hall to persuade the company to stay. Councilman 
Michael Woo, who represents Hollywood, has assured both Pacific and Disney that 
they are welcome. The Community Redevelopment Agency, which oversees 
development along Hollywood Boulevard, has done the same. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said last week, "I think we need to send a very clear signal that we 
welcome the return of refurbished movie theaters to Hollywood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's critics, however, complain that Hollywood deserves more than a 
partially restored theater from a company that has built an entire theme park 
in Florida around a re-creation of historic Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"They have been stealing Hollywood's architecture and history, and making 
millions off of it in Florida, but when it comes to the real Hollywood, they 
are trying to cover it up," said Robert Nudelman, a theater buff who heads a 
Hollywood group concerned about renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the renovation plans has already caused so many delays that 
Disney has abandoned any hope of holding the "Dick Tracy" premiere in 
Hollywood. Several weeks ago, the company suspended work on the theater's 
inside, where crews were removing layers of plaster and paneling that had been 
tacked to walls and ceilings over the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Disney officials are hopeful the problems can be worked out, Richard 
Cook, president of Buena Vista, said they are reassessing their interest in the 
Hollywood project. "We are considering everything." 
</P>
<P>
The city's Cultural Heritage Commission has the power to delay the project for 
up to a year with City Council concurrence. After one year, the commission 
loses authority over the project. 
</P>
<P>
The El Capitan, known as the Paramount when Pacific Theaters closed it last 
fall, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At a recent 
meeting, the city commission recommended that it be designated a city landmark. 
This Wednesday, the commission is expected to decide whether covering the 
auditorium's original walls and ceiling would violate standards that govern 
historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's staff architect, Jay Oren, has expressed reservations about 
the appropriateness of the auditorium renovation in light of preservation 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission has no intention of pushing Disney out of Hollywood," 
commission President Amarjit S. Marwah said. "But the commission has the 
intention of requiring Disney to preserve the architectural features of any 
building they deal with." 
</P>
<P>
The three major preservation groups that deal with historic issues in Hollywood 
have closed ranks and agreed not to actively oppose the Disney plan, even 
though each of them has been highly critical of it and some members continue to 
deride it privately. One source, who asked not to be identified, said the 
groups do not want to bear the burden of having chased Disney out of Hollywood, 
no matter how strong their objections to the proposed renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, representatives from Disney, Pacific, Woo's office and the 
Community Redevelopment Agency met with the three preservation groups in an 
effort to work out their differences. In the spirit of compromise, Disney 
agreed to restore various parts of the theater, including a basement lobby and 
the ceiling in the main lobby. The preservation groups, in turn, agreed to keep 
quiet about their objections. 
</P>
<P>
But Nudelman, the local theater buff, has refused to honor the deal. And the 
community group he heads, the Hollywood Project Area Committee, has supported 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Nudelman went to the meeting of the Cultural Heritage Commission two weeks ago 
armed with photographs of El Capitan's original interior and a resolution 
demanding that the auditorium be restored. Meanwhile, members of the 
preservation groups struggled to explain to the commission their position on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are looking at this and saying, 'Well it could be worse, we are 
getting some things,' " Nudelman said. "What kind of example are we setting 
here? What will happen to the rest of the theaters on the boulevard?"

618 ARRESTED IN S.F. VALLEY GANG SWEEPS; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: POLICE CALL IT MOST SUCCESSFUL OPERATION EVER. BUT VIOLENCE PLAGUES 
SOUTHLAND AS AT LEAST 15 PEOPLE ARE REPORTED SLAIN.

In the most extensive crackdown ever on gangs operating in the San Fernando 
Valley, police during the weekend arrested 618 people -- including 270 alleged 
gang members -- for crimes ranging from possession of narcotics to unpaid 
parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 Los Angeles police officers were assigned to the anti-gang task force 
"Operation Hammer," which from Friday night until Sunday swept through known 
gang hangouts. About 14 pounds of illegal drugs were confiscated, along with 51 
vehicles, officers said. The sweep came in response to citizens' complaints 
about growing gang problems, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The public is complaining all the time about gang members hanging out in front 
of liquor stores and apartments, selling narcotics and scaring people that are 
walking by," Sgt. Frank Stilo said. 
</P>
<P>
Recent police crime statistics show that gang-related crimes in the Valley 
during 1989 more than doubled from the previous year, from 510 to 1,191. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, in what had been the largest Valley gang sweep, police arrested 267 
people, including 94 suspected gang members. Police said the latest Valley 
sweep, their most successful ever, netted 115 felony arrests and 503 
misdemeanor arrests. Forty-one people were booked on suspicion of driving under 
the influence of alcohol or drugs and 48 were arrested for investigation of 
possessing narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
"The sweep, in my opinion, appears to have been very successful," Stilo said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, violence plagued other parts of the Southland, as at least 15 people 
were reported slain during the weekend, including a young woman allegedly 
gunned down by her stepfather in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Olivia Bohaman, 21, and a younger sister were found wounded in the 
living room of their house Saturday afternoon, Santa Ana police said. Bohaman 
died of head wounds and the sister was treated for wounds to her arms and back. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were seeking Jose Lopez Perez, 32, the estranged husband of 
the victims' mother, who was seen driving away from the house. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, two men were shot at a hamburger stand near MacArthur Park about 5 
a.m. Sunday, Los Angeles police said. One died and the other was hospitalized 
in serious condition. The victims were shot by a man who got out of a car, 
walked up to them and fired, police said. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man was found shot to death in his La Puente home at 12:15 a.m. 
Sunday, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. In South Los Angeles, an 
unidentified man was stabbed to death early Sunday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, an unidentified 22-year-old man was shot and killed in South Los 
Angeles and another unidentified man was shot to death in southwest Los 
Angeles, police said. An unidentified man was shot as he stood on the sidewalk 
in the Los Feliz area early Saturday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old boy was shot to death in an unincorporated area near Whittier 
just before 1 a.m. Saturday. And a second 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death 
later in Pico Rivera. Sheriff's deputies said both crimes appeared to be gang 
related. 
</P>
<P>
In Hacienda Heights, Joseph Sanchez, 21, was shot to death Saturday in his 
garage, sheriff's deputies said. Witnesses said they saw two men leaving the 
scene on foot, but no arrests were made, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported five more deaths Friday night.

EARLY CHILDBEARING BASED ON LOGIC

Black teen-agers who have children are not acting irrationally, despite the 
high incidence of health problems among both mothers and children, researchers 
said. Instead, they are simply responding to social realities. 
</P>
<P>
As the girls get older, their reality is that they become less healthy, there 
are fewer men around, and they may need to enter the work force, said 
sociologist Arline Geronimus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. 
Furthermore, they have to rely on family members to help with the children and 
those members may not be available later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not implying that a teen-age girl sits down and thinks this through," 
Geronimus said. But "the fact is that early childbearing is a persistent 
pattern in history for whole populations of women." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA sociologist Walter Allen noted that most middle-class teen-age girls are 
on their way to economic stability, which includes a husband and a job, so they 
postpone child-bearing. But under-class girls are unlikely ever to reach such 
stability, so they could wait forever to have children. In short, there is no 
disincentive for having children early.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON INNER WORKINGS OF THE BRAIN;

<P>
DIAGNOSIS: MEG, A NEW WAY OF MEASURING MAGNETIC FIELDS, CAN BE USED TO STUDY 
EPILEPSY AND OTHER MALADIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Lovers, lawyers and politicians are among the people who would like to be able 
to tell what another person is thinking. Psychologists and neurologists have 
more modest goals: they would like to tell how a person thinks, to map the 
brain's activity. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, medical imaging techniques have been giving astonishingly 
vivid and detailed interior views of the human brain. These include the CAT 
scan, an advanced form of X-ray; MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which relies 
on signals emitted by the atoms in the brain itself; and PET (positron emission 
tomography), which uses a weak radioactive tracer. 
</P>
<P>
Now a new technique -- magnetoencephalography, or MEG -- is being added to the 
arsenal. Though still in its preliminary research stages, MEG is giving the 
clearest views yet of the workings of the human brain by detecting the almost 
vanishingly weak magnetic fields that flash into existence when neurons fire 
momentarily. By detecting such fields, MEG determines which neurons are firing 
and measures the strength of their activity. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, MEG makes use of the world's most sensitive magnetometers, called 
SQUIDs -- Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices. A SQUID relies on a 
type of superconductivity that British physicist Brian Josephson won a Nobel 
Prize for discovering. 
</P>
<P>
Superconductivity involves electric currents that flow with no resistance, at 
temperatures close to absolute zero, minus 460 degrees Fahrenheit. In the 
"Josephson effect," such currents are extremely sensitive to the presence of 
even a very weak magnetic field, falling off markedly if such a field is 
present. 
</P>
<P>
In a SQUID, this sensitivity makes it possible to detect such fields even when 
they are a billion times weaker than the magnetism of the Earth, which swings a 
compass needle. That is the strength of magnetic fields produced in the normal 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
These fields are produced by electrical flows within neurons, and such electric 
currents in the brain have been studied for decades using the technique of EEG, 
electroencephalography. But the skull and the brain's internal fluids distort 
the flow of these currents, making it difficult to interpret the measurements. 
Indeed, a common EEG technique has been to remove part of the skull and place 
electrodes directly on the surface of the living brain. 
</P>
<P>
In MEG, by contrast, the magnetic fields emerge from the brain undistorted by 
nearby fluids or tissues. The technique is totally non-invasive; the patient 
does not even need to have his head shaved. The doctor simply presses a 
detector, which looks like a beer can and holds several SQUIDs, against the 
patient's head, then interprets the readings with the help of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
Existing techniques allow no more than a few such measurements at any given 
moment, however. Thus, scans of the entire brain must be built up over several 
hours, with the detector being moved from place to place around the head. And 
the resulting scans are easiest to interpret when the neural activity being 
studied is concentrated in isolated spots within the brain, rather than being 
distributed throughout its volume. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, MEG has thus far been used particularly for studies of 
epilepsy. Epilepsy has been described as an electrical storm in the brain; it 
features the uncontrolled and violent firing of neurons, in ways that produce 
particularly strong magnetic fields. About 2.3 million Americans are 
epileptics; their seizures can produce uncontrolled movements of the arms or 
legs, abrupt memory lapses, loss of consciousness, or convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
Most such people are helped with medication, but for as many as 50,000 
patients, surgery is the only remedy, The neurosurgeon must cut away portions 
of brain tissue that trigger seizures. First, however, these portions must be 
located precisely. 
</P>
<P>
Neurologist William W. Sutherling of UCLA said that by using MEG, it is 
possible to map magnetic field patterns directly onto photographs of the 
patient's head, graphically indicating areas of abnormal activity. MEG thus 
locates these areas with high accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
For all its promise, however, MEG still is in the research stage. Only a few 
major hospitals have the needed instruments and facilities. The Food and Drug 
Administration has licensed the use of MEG for research on epilepsy, but not 
yet for its routine clinical use. And investigators continue to devote a great 
deal of attention to such basic issues as signal processing as they learn to 
extract the most information from their measurements. 
</P>
<P>
At a conference held at New York University last year, other researchers showed 
that MEG can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Until now, Alzheimer's 
has been detected only by retrieving tissue from the brain for examination. But 
Rodolfo Llinas and his colleagues at NYU have found a very abnormal pattern of 
magnetic activity in Alzheimer's patients, in the regions of their brains that 
respond to hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Our results show that the MEG technology can be usefully applied in 
psychiatric patients," they have written.

"My bet is that this will become an important technology," said Christopher 
Gallen of the Scripps Clinic. "These images may become as important to 
psychiatry and neurology as are X-ray images to internal medicine."

Charting Normal Brain Functions 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to understand the workings of the hand-activity area of a normal 
brain, doctors placed electrodes for three mapping procedures: MEG, or 
magnetoencephalography, which charts magnetic fields, EEG -- 
electroencephalogram, which charts electrical energy and ECoG, 
electrocorticogram, which maps the brain's direct electrical current from 
electrodes placed on the brain itself. In MEG and EEG, electrodes are placed on 
the scalp. Brain functions are so quick that each snapshot records activity for 
500 microseconds -- about 1/20th of a blink of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
Charting an Epileptic Seizure 
</P>
<P>
Doctors used a combination of MEG and EEG mapping techniques to diagnose the 
source of frontal lobe seizures. The series of snapshots, which lasted 4 
microseconds each, pinpointed the patient's problem area. Subsequent surgery 
and treatment lessened the frequency of seizures.

FANTASIES ABOUT LIFE, NATURE

Modern fantasies about early native Americans living in harmony with nature are 
just that -- fantasies, according to anthropologist Timothy Kohler of 
Washington State University. He has found that the prehistoric Anasazi of 
northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado significantly altered the 
plant and animal mixes near their settlements. 
</P>
<P>
The effect on the environment occurred through wood harvesting for fuel and 
construction, field clearing and burning. This slash-and-burn strategy was 
initially successful, Kohler said, leading to population growth, but eventually 
populations became too dense to support this land-intensive agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Kohler suggested that human impact on the environment in the Dolores 
Archeological Project area in southwestern Colorado eventually caused the 
residents to leave the area after a 300-year occupation. Residents had to move 
elsewhere to get enough to eat, he said.

AGING MARK SPITZ EYES RENEWED OLYMPIC GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The afternoon sun no longer covered Lane 8 of the UCLA pool when Mark Spitz, 
three days past 40, jumped in to swim. It was cold and dark in his column of 
water, not a particularly good day for swimming, or dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz put in 40 minutes, which is a fine workout for a man nearing middle age, 
but a little on the light side for a future Olympian. Then he laid his head 
back as if the water were his pillow, slowly closed his eyes and puffed out his 
cheeks. Moments later, his eyes blinked open to see two people standing on the 
deck, peering down at him. 
</P>
<P>
"My arms," he said, "feel like lead." 
</P>
<P>
He puttered around another moment or two, then made up his mind that the 1992 
Summer Olympics were far enough away that on this day in February 1990, he 
could afford to get out of the water. "Well, I've got 862 days left," he said, 
finally managing a smile, and the workout was over. 
</P>
<P>
Coming back to the water after 17 years on land is not easy, Mark Spitz is 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer Spitz -- America's most famous swimmer and the not-altogether 
beloved winner of seven gold medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics -- decided he 
wanted to become a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team in Barcelona. Last 
September word got out, and a giddy sense of anticipation enveloped the 
swimming world. Spitz swam for an hour; granted an interview for an hour. Swam 
another hour, granted another interview. And so forth. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a heady time, but it's also sobering. Spitz injured his chronically 
bad back, spent several weeks recuperating at home and about six weeks out of 
the water. "Too much too soon," he said. As he talked, his hands tried to coax 
the pain out of his left hamstring. He isn't even attempting to swim his chosen 
Olympic stroke, the butterfly, for a few more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It's all such a chore that, with a chuckle, he said the most difficult part is 
leaving himself enough energy for the 10-minute walk home, through the UCLA 
campus to his single-level, four-bedroom brick home in plush Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And yet Spitz is undaunted. He said he most definitely will get back into shape 
after doing little more than walking the dog and sailing for the better part of 
two decades; he believes he can swim as fast as he did in 1972, when he set the 
world record in the 100-meter butterfly (as well as three other individual 
events); he believes he can make an Olympic team full of swimmers half his age; 
and he is not going to give up, come what may. 
</P>
<P>
"I want this," he said in an interview before a recent practice. "As a kid, I 
ended up in the sport of swimming through osmosis. I went out, sort of swam, 
was on a team, I got better, I got good, I got great, then I held world 
records. I never had a chance to sit back and reflect: What would I be doing if 
I wasn't doing this? 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I've elected to actually do it. There's a difference. When you want to do 
something, you want it more. Not that I didn't want it then. But now I want it 
even more." 
</P>
<P>
When he announced his intention to make the Olympic team at age 42, the 
pictures that went with all the stories showed a bronzed, sculpted Spitz, 
jet-black hair slicked back by the water, a man unchanged by time (except for 
the mustache, which is long gone). In reality, there's gray in that black hair, 
quite a bit of it. 
</P>
<P>
For a 40-year-old, Spitz is in wonderful shape and still possesses the great 
swimmer's body, arms that go on forever attached to a torso so long his head 
hits the roof when he sits in the car, making it appear he is 6 feet 4, not a 
generous 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
But when he walks out of the locker room in his swimming suit, after all the 
UCLA swimmers have passed by, it's evident time takes its toll on everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks a little thick, doesn't he?" said Mark Wallace, one of Spitz's best 
friends from their Indiana University days, who was sitting by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll move that weight around," said UCLA swimming coach Ron Ballatore, who 
has mixed Spitz into his practices and is one of the truest believers in the 
Spitz camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not toned," said Spitz, who weighs 185 pounds, 10 more than in Munich. "In 
six months I will be." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Spitz is more like one of us now than he was when he was 22 makes 
his "quest," to use his word, all the more enchanting. He isn't an untouchable 
god; he used to be, but not anymore. Now he's a husband and the father of an 
8-year-old boy who'd rather play baseball than swim. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz runs his own real-estate-development business and never became a dentist, 
despite what people remember. He walks the UCLA campus in baggy sweats, 
slouched over, as is his way, and no one pays attention to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I owe it to myself, I owe it to my sport, I owe it to my generation, I think, 
to find out what it's all about," Spitz said. "I really preserved myself. I was 
Mr. Joe Straight Arrow. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs. What 
does it take to get a body back in shape? We'll all find out." 
</P>
<P>
But Spitz is coming back for reasons more profound than this. If he simply 
wanted to find out how fast he could swim, for swimming's sake, he would join a 
masters club and compete against men his age. Although he's not doing that, it 
was a friend in masters swimming that gave him the idea to try for one more 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring Spitz ran into Lance Larson, a member of the 1960 Olympic team who 
is swimming masters and going faster than he did 30 years ago. He suggested 
Spitz could do that, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, meanwhile, was taking another tack. With Spitz's 1972 times firmly in 
mind, he loved to calculate where his buddy would have placed had he swum that 
time in a certain event. Just last spring, at the NCAA championships, he looked 
at the scoreboard after the 100 butterfly, turned toward a woman in the stands 
and held up an open hand. "Fifth," he thought. 
</P>
<P>
The woman nodded and smiled back. She was Marge Counsilman, wife of Spitz's 
coach at Indiana, the legendary Doc Counsilman. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about that," Wallace said. "His world record would have been good for 
fifth place 17 years later." 
</P>
<P>
And that, eventually, was what got to Spitz. He set a world record in Munich 
with a time of 54.27 seconds in the 100 butterfly. The current world record is 
52.84, set by Pablo Morales of the United States. All of Spitz's other world 
records have been lowered by three or five seconds. But not this one. His 
butterfly time would have placed eighth at the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz started to wonder if he might not be able to swim that time again -- or 
go even faster, as those in masters swimming were doing. He would have to train 
for one event -- not seven, as he did in 1972. He could test new coaching 
techniques with new coaches. He could regain his eligibility because of new 
rules allowing professionalism in swimming. He could try to do the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I'm in this is because of what swimmers in the 100 butterfly 
didn't do in the last 17 to 18 years," he said. "They didn't improve my time by 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
It's also interesting to note Spitz's 54.27 might not have been the best he 
could have swum in the late summer of 1972. For one, he was involved in "all 
those damn events" and was conserving energy any time he got ahead in a race. 
He also was not pushed in the 100 fly in Munich; Bruce Robertson of Canada won 
the silver in 55.56. That's a significant difference in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"If I just do my same time, it's competitive," he said. "If I improve my time, 
we're talking about possibly breaking the world record. I've got nothing to 
lose. I'll go in three stages: get into shape as a 22-year-old, which I'll do 
in the next six months; go fast enough to make the Olympic team in the trials 
in 1992; and then go to the Olympics and see what I get." 
</P>
<P>
To ask a question is to burst the bubble, but an observer must do it: 
</P>
<P>
"How do you get back into the shape of a 22-year-old when you're 40?" 
</P>
<P>
Spitz: "I'm asking myself that same question. But there are guys who are 50 who 
are swimming faster than when they were 20. Their times are slower than mine, 
but the analogy still works." 
</P>
<P>
Another question: "But didn't they have more to improve upon than you, who was 
in peak condition at 22?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, that's true," Spitz said. "Maybe that's a factor. I don't know. . . . The 
safe thing to say is I won't make it. That's more logical." 
</P>
<P>
Spitz would prefer not to think of all this, at least not now. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one great ray of hope. In 1988, Pablo was the world-record holder and 
Pablo didn't make the Olympic team. They didn't break his world record, either. 
I was the world-record holder in 1968 and I lost (by finishing second). I don't 
have to be the best before the Olympics to get to the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
The path to the Olympics begins sometime late this summer, when Spitz said he 
will compete in his first race. It probably will not be part of a conventional 
meet. At least two TV networks have expressed interest in being there when he 
first steps onto the blocks, and it's likely the event will be built around 
Spitz. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, he is swimming simply to prepare. After a morning of business 
calls, Spitz makes his 10-minute walk from home to pool for his 3:30 p.m. 
workout with the UCLA team. Although Ballatore is more engrossed with his dozen 
collegians, he keeps a watchful eye on Spitz, who is working himself back into 
shape after the injury by swimming 2,000 to 3,000 yards a day, six days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"He needs to get up to 6,000, and he will," Ballatore said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Spitz will not swim as many miles for this Olympics as others might 
because he will be so focused on the butterfly. Interestingly, although the 
butterfly is his stroke, Spitz will swim mostly freestyle until the day of his 
first race closes in. 
</P>
<P>
"He never did a lot of fly anyway," Ballatore said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Ballatore spoke over the phone with George Haines, who 
coached Spitz when he was a teenager. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he can do it," Haines said to Ballatore. "Tell me, how does his 
freestyle look?" 
</P>
<P>
"It looks great," Ballatore said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Haines replied, "it always looked great." 
</P>
<P>
To make the team that heads to Barcelona, Spitz will have to finish either 
first or second in the 100 fly at the trials in March 1992. To get to the 
trials, he will have to swim a qualifying time sometime the year before. In 
1988, the qualifying time was 55.79 seconds, but it will be lower this time. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi won the '88 trials in 53.09 and took the silver medal in Seoul in 
53.01 seconds, 1-100th of a second behind gold medalist Anthony Nesty of 
Surinam. Biondi had the gold medal in his grasp until he miscalculated the 
number of strokes it would take to hit the wall; he glided in, and Nesty won 
when Biondi's last stroke did not carry him to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
"If that had been Mark, there's no way he would have lost that race," said 
Wallace. "He's too competitive." 
</P>
<P>
If Spitz qualifies, he will face about 40 swimmers for those two spots on the 
Olympic team. Making the team would put him one qualifying heat from the 
eight-man final in Barcelona. The final would put him within a minute of the 
most improbable personal story in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
Spitz already has a bank vault full of gold medals, nine in all (seven from 
Munich, two from relays during his disappointing performance at the 1968 Mexico 
City Games). But he is coming back to earn something worth more than gold to 
him: the respect and perhaps even the love of Americans who never understood or 
really cared for him the last time he came around. 
</P>
<P>
Arrogance is a part of the swimming "psych," the look, the airs, that tell 
another swimmer you are about to beat them. Spitz was great at walking around 
the pool as if he owned the place, and he just about did. Asked if he thought 
he was going to hit it rich after Munich (and he did), his answer, typically, 
was something like, "Are there stars in the sky?" 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely mellowed," said Wallace. "He's not as sarcastic as he was. He 
was very inward-focused then. He really didn't care what he said or what others 
said about him. All that mattered to him was what he did in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Those were strange, terrible times. Soon after his last race in Munich, Spitz, 
who is Jewish, was whisked out of town when terrorists took 11 Israeli athletes 
and coaches hostage and later killed them all. Spitz was safe, but he was 
caught in a whirlwind of emotions that deposited him in a world of endorsements 
and total isolation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 22, the press was different, athletics was different," he said. "I 
started making money from an amateur sport. There was a little queasiness and 
uneasy feeling about the fact that I was doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the scene for 14 years, but the public all of a sudden became aware 
of me in a one-week period of time, and then I was gone. I wasn't out to make 
another touchdown pass like Joe Montana or another Super Bowl championship or 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it's not that I want to bask in the glory that I think I was denied, but 
the fact is, I'm trying to do something that for me is an interesting and 
exciting challenge. It sort of represents the ideals of the Olympics: It's the 
spirit of competing, the attempt." 
</P>
<P>
Swimming people are intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot going against him," said Biondi, winner of five golds, one 
silver and one bronze in Seoul. "Age, his time out of swimming and the 
tremendous amount of motivation needed to smash people like a bug. There are 
plenty of obstacles, but he definitely has a chance." 
</P>
<P>
"If anyone can do it," said Ballatore, "he's the kind of guy who can." 
</P>
<P>
But can anyone do it? 
</P>
<P>
"My days are numbered," Spitz said. "I've got 26 months before the Olympic 
trials. Twenty-six months may seem like a lot to a guy who's 20, but to a guy 
who's now 40, that seems like it's 26 days. Some days I get frustrated with 
myself. Other days, I feel great. 
</P>
<P>
"But, what the heck."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: KAPSTEIN, PADRES TO YANK VIP SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Kapstein, after being informed of several complaints by Padre season 
ticket holders over the construction of 70 field-level seats that would 
diminish the quality of their own, said Sunday that the seats will be removed. 
</P>
<P>
The VIP seats were added in January along the first- and third-base lines 
behind the dugouts for Padre executives to entertain sponsors and guests, but 
Kapstein said that the Padres now will spend additional funds to remove the 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
Kapstein, who was hired Thursday to oversee the daily operations of the Padres, 
said in a prepared statement: "It has been brought to my attention that plans 
were made and acted upon to add 70 field-level seats for the 1990 regular 
season. We are taking immediate action by ordering the cancellation of these 
plans. We will do nothing that is contrary to the best interest of our loyal 
and valued season-ticket holders. Business and ticket operations have been 
installed to put the field-seating configuration back as it has been in 
previous years." BOB NIGHTENGALE

JACK NICKLAUS IS HUNGRY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WOODY WOODBURN, SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Beware Of Bear!" 
</P>
<P>
That is the sign the golfing world should post on locker room doors this year. 
And not just on the PGA Seniors Tour. The tall, blond flat-bellies better 
beware as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Bear is hungry. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Jack William Nicklaus had such an appetite, he ate up the golf 
world. That year was 1980. Jack turned 40. 
</P>
<P>
The previous year he had been terrible -- by Nicklaus standards. At age 39, 
Jack won a paltry $59,434 after winning at least four times that sum in each of 
the previous eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Jack dealt with the disappointment by setting a goal for the first time in his 
career. He sought to win not one, but two major championships. 
</P>
<P>
First the dream, then the accomplishment. Jack won the 1980 U.S. Open and PGA 
Championship. Two majors. "I didn't want turning 40 to be a downer," he 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Well, in January, Jack Nicklaus reached another milestone. He turned 50. And he 
doesn't want it to be a downer, especially after winning just $95,595 as a 
49-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Sounds a lot like 1980 when everybody wrote him off as the OLDEN Bear, doesn't 
it? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. And for the second time in his career, Jack Nicklaus has set a goal -- 
he hankers to win an event on the Senior Tour and one on the regular tour 
("preferably a major" of course). It's a double-eagle no one else has yet 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
But then Jack Nicklaus has spent his entire career doing magical feats no one 
else could pull off. His record 20 major victories is surely as safely etched 
in stone as Cy Young's 511 career wins. 
</P>
<P>
Half of Jack's stated goal would seem a cinch. For the Golden Bear, winning a 
Seniors Tour event should be as easy as catching fish in a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
Jack doesn't plan to play but a handful of the 50-and-older tournaments. His 
first will be the Traditions in Scottsdale, Ariz., the last weekend in March. 
But then, one alone might be plenty enough. 
</P>
<P>
But what about winning against the long hitters of the kiddie tour? Don't bet 
your mortgage against it. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the ol' master was surprisingly competitive in the majors, which is 
really all that is important to Nicklaus. If it's not a major -- or his own 
Memorial Tournament -- it's pretty much just a Quad Cities Open to Jack. 
</P>
<P>
To give you an idea, Jack's last five tournament victories have been the U.S. 
Open, PGA, Memorial, Colonial and the Masters. Three majors and Jack's own baby 
-- and a throw in. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, his last win was that majestic Masters charge four summers past. For 
Jack Nicklaus that's not a dry spell, it's a 
ban-on-watering-the-lawn-and-washing-cars drought. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says his once-ailing back isn't hampering his swing these days. "My 
back feels very good. I think I'm in good shape ... even for someone younger 
than me." 
</P>
<P>
Jack is not ready to give up the muscle tees just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think I can compete on the regular tour," he states. "When I tee it 
up, I expect to be in contention. It's that simple. I'm not the player I used 
to be, but I still think I can be very good ... very competitive. Whether it's 
realistic or not, I always expect to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
On a bad day, Jack Nicklaus used to be very, very good. But those days are 
past. He can no longer afford any bad holes now. He needs all his trump cards 
to make bid. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long time ago that a fat kid with crew cut won the 1963 Masters. Heck, 
it wasn't yesterday a 46-year-old living legend won the 1986 Masters. How 
quickly time flies. Later this month that young kid from Columbus, Ohio, is set 
to become a grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
But don't call the Golden Bear the Olden Bear just yet. 
</P>
<P>
His sideburns are speckled with gray and his cobalt-blue eyes squint more often 
than they used to. Certainly the par-4s and 5s seem longer than ever. The 
drives no longer orbit the moon. 
</P>
<P>
"The older you get, the stronger the wind gets -- and it's always in your face 
on every hole," Jack will tell you.

He stands over a long 4-iron out pf some thick rough, that used to maybe take a 
6-iron, and quips: "This used to be a piece of cake a few years back." 
</P>
<P>
Now the cake has a fire hazard of candles on it and the wind in his face seems 
to be getting stronger.

ROCCO READY TO TAKE GAME TO NEXT LEVEL; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. OPEN: MEDIATE TIES FOR THIRD, BUT HE IS CONVINCED HE CAN WIN AFTER SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE TIME IN CONTENTION.

Rocco Mediate finally believes that he can play with the Big Guys -- the 
golfing greats, the name players. 
</P>
<P>
In two consecutive tournaments Mediate has been paired with the leaders in the 
final round. That's because he has been one of them. 
</P>
<P>
He has been sought by the media, beloved by fans and followed by galleries that 
cheer or bemoan his every move. 
</P>
<P>
He's Rocco, and Sunday he left his mark at the Riviera Country Club, where he 
shot a 71 in the final round of the L.A. Open to tie for third place with Peter 
Jacobsen. 
</P>
<P>
"I played well today, and it showed me I can do it," Mediate said. "I got there 
this time and I played a lot better than the last time and hopefully next time 
I'll do one or two things better. 
</P>
<P>
Mediate, 27, said his performance at Riviera was the best he has ever played 
and the best he has ever scored. "Ever," Mediate repeated. "If you would have 
told me when this tournament started that I would shoot 14 under, I would have 
laughed." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate is not laughing anymore. He believes he can win now, and that seemingly 
was a missing ingredient in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous, but it was great," he said, "It's what you want to feel. All 
the years you put into it, this is what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate, who is in his fifth year on the tour, had a chance to win a few weeks 
ago when he led the AT &amp;T at Pebble Beach but faltered in the final round 
to finish eighth. 
</P>
<P>
That final day Mediate shot a 77, but says he left feeling positive. He says he 
learned he needed to play consistent golf and, more so, that he could play with 
the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
At the L.A. Open, Mediate played four days of solid golf, shooting a tournament 
total of 270, four strokes behind winner Fred Couples. He entered the final 
round at 14 under, two strokes off the lead, and stayed in contention until he 
bogeyed the 15th hole to fall two strokes behind. He never threatened for the 
lead again. 
</P>
<P>
"After the 11th hole I knew I had a good chance to win," Mediate said. "I 
played well, I brought it back and I was one over all day. I figured if I could 
just keep hitting good shots I'd be fine, but I kept just missing the putts, 
and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
"Then once Freddy birdied the 11th hole he played perfect from then on." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate appeared a little shaky at first Sunday. On hole No. 1, he stubbed a 
chip shot on the fringe that went about one foot. He managed to save par, but 
hit his next drive on No. 2 into the trees and eventually bogeyed the hole. 
</P>
<P>
That dropped him to 13 under, two strokes behind Gil Morgan and four behind 
Couples. His birdies on No. 8 and No. 11 left him trailing by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
"On fifteen, I tried too hard and pulled it," Mediate said. "Then I hit a good 
shot, but it caught a tree branch. I was close on 17 and 18, I almost made it." 
</P>
<P>
Mediate's bogey on No. 15 put him at two strokes behind Couples. He parred the 
remaining holes-with his putt on No. 17 stopping a fingertip from the cup-to 
finish in third place. 
</P>
<P>
"When Doc (Morgan) and I were walking up on 18, the crowd was going crazy 
cheering," Mediate said. "I have never seen anything like it. Doc and I were 
talking and we couldn't hear each other, we were just shaking our heads. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that they scream and holler, and then, right before you're going to hit 
it, it's immediately quiet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun, and I enjoyed you all." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling appears to be mutual.

When Cheryl Howard left home Sunday morning for the 45-mile drive to Riviera 
Country Club, the last thing she envisioned was becoming a controversial but 
humorous footnote to the Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
Attending her first professional tournament, she and husband Richard took a 
spot on the grass behind the ninth green to watch each threesome play through. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael Allen's approach shot rolled over the green and died at her feet, 
she did what she thought she was supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
She picked the ball up and tried to hand it to a nearby marshal. Her husband's 
poker face could not hide his humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing," Mrs. Howard, a student artist at Mount San Antonio 
College, said as she put her hand over her blushing face for the umpteenth 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband didn't tell me not to touch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
After Allen and playing partners Hal Sutton and Hale Irwin reached the green, 
the latter two finished up while Allen was forced to wait until a tournament 
official could be summoned. Glenn Tait then watched as Allen took a drop. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where she goes, she always makes a splash," said Richard Howard, a 
paperhanger from Walnut, Calif. "Allen was really nice about it. He even liked 
the lie (where his wife dropped the ball after the marshal refused to take it.) 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I hope I can keep it here."' 
</P>
<P>
When Allen, the leader after the first two rounds, made a scrambling par four 
on the hole, the loudest applause came from a relieved Cheryl Howard. 
</P>
<P>
After Allen rolled in his short putt, he walked toward her and tossed her his 
ball amid a few good-natured cries from the gallery of "Throw her out of here!" 
</P>
<P>
Said Mrs. Howard: "When he got to his ball, he said: 'I suppose you want the 
ball after I sink it in.' And I said, 'Yup.' I think he had second thoughts 
about it coming back." 
</P>
<P>
The last group of the day, Gil Morgan, Rocco Mediate and third-round leader 
Fred Couples, were stranded midway down the ninth fairway during the 15-minute 
delay. But they all parred the hole.

SANTA ANITA; 
</P>
<P>
HAWKSTER GIVEN HIGH WEIGHT OF 123 POUNDS FOR THE BIG 'CAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Ron McAnally will be saddling the high weight in the $1-million Santa 
Anita Handicap next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But the horse probably won't be Bayakoa, the 6-year-old mare who would be 
favored if she ran. 
</P>
<P>
McAnally's only definite starter is Hawkster, the 4-year-old colt who was 
assigned 123 pounds by Santa Anita racing secretary Tom Robbins, even though he 
hasn't won a race on dirt since he was a 2-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins rated Bayakoa at 127 pounds, three pounds more than anyone else, but 
because of a sex allowance the McAnally runner would actually have to carry 122 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a day like it is today, Bayakoa won't run," McAnally said from his box 
seat near the finish line Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The weather was dry and the track was fast Sunday. In other words, McAnally 
will enter Bayakoa on Friday, but only run her in the Big 'Cap if there's an 
off track. Bayakoa, who has handled all kinds of tracks, is even more effective 
in the mud. Last year's champion female has won her first two races this year 
and is victorious in 10 of her last 11 starts. A filly or mare has never won 
the Big 'Cap, which was first run in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
The weight for Bayakoa doesn't bother McAnally, although Hawkster's assignment 
is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I had heard that the mare might get one pound more than what she 
got," McAnally said. "But the weight for Hawkster is very unfair. They've 
weighted him based on his grass record rather than what he's done on dirt." 
</P>
<P>
In Eclipse Awards voting, Hawkster was voted the third best turf horse in the 
country last year, behind Steinlen and Yankee Affair. Hawkster has won four of 
five starts on grass, but is two for 14 on dirt. The Big 'Cap is 1 1/4 miles on 
the main track. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect and Prized were weighted at 124 pounds, three pounds less than 
Bayakoa's theoretical weight, but neither is expected to run. Frankly Perfect 
won the San Luis Obispo Handicap on the grass a week ago and Prized will run 
Sunday, but in the Arcadia Handicap, a $100,000 turf race at a mile. Steinlen, 
who would have carried 123 had he run in the Big 'Cap, is also a probable 
starter for the Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
Of the horses expected to run in the Big 'Cap, these are the weights: 
</P>
<P>
Hawkster, 123 pounds; Lively One, 122; Flying Continental and Ruhlmann, 121 
apiece; Criminal Type and Present Value, both 119; Quiet American, 116; Stylish 
Winner, 113; and Santangelo, 111. 
</P>
<P>
In another Big 'Cap development, McAnally announced that Pat Valenzuela would 
regain the mount on Hawkster. The change from Russell Baze is believed to be 
the decision of Shelly Meredith, who owns Hawkster. 
</P>
<P>
Baze rode Hawkster for the first time in the Oak Tree Invitational at Santa 
Anita last October when Valenzuela, who has been bothered by drug problems, was 
a no-show and didn't bother to notify McAnally. Valenzuela's long-time agent, 
Jerry Ingordo, quit the rider over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Under Baze, Hawkster won the 1 1/2-mile Oak Tree in 2:22 4/5, a world- record 
time. Baze has also ridden Hawkster in his two races since then, a fifth-place 
finish in the Japan Cup and a third-place finish in the Strub on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Unless rain next weekend puts Bayakoa in the 'Big Cap field, the mare will head 
for Oaklawn Park, to run in either the Oaklawn Handicap on April 14 or the 
Apple Blossom Handicap four days later. Bayakoa won the Apple Blossom last 
year. She would have to face male horses in the Oaklawn. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get some weight off or she'll be way up there by the end of the 
year," McAnally said. "The difference between running against colts then or in 
the Big 'Cap is that the Big 'Cap would be her third race in four weeks. She's 
been doing great, though, since her last race (the Santa Margarita Handicap on 
Feb. 18). The race didn't take anything out of her." 
</P>
<P>
When Frankly Perfect won the Hollywood Turf Cup last December, Sylvester 
Stallone, having bought a piece of the horse from Bruce McNall and Wayne 
Gretzky just days before, represented the owners in the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be very addictive," said Stallone, who has owned polo ponies but 
who had never been to a race track before. 
</P>
<P>
The addiction was among the shortest on record, because when Frankly Perfect 
won the San Luis Obispo Handicap at Santa Anita last Monday -- in his first 
start since the Turf Cup -- only McNall, the owner of the Kings, and Gretzky, 
his highest salaried employee, were listed as owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Stallone's interest in the horse, and another one that he was partners in, was 
bought out," said Steve Nessenblatt, who manages McNall's racing interests. "I 
don't think the decision was made by Stallone alone, it came from his circle of 
advisers, and the others weren't as wild about racing as he was. Stallone has 
also been busy with his latest 'Rocky' picture and left the decision to the 
others." 
</P>
<P>
The next time Frankly Perfect runs, however, he will have still another 
celebrity owner -- Jerry Buss, the owner of the Lakers, and McNall's former 
partner with the Kings. Buss is also becoming a partner with McNall and Larry 
Robinson, another member of the Kings, in Down Again, the 6-year-old mare who 
ran ninth Sunday in the $100,000 Buena Vista Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The Buena Vista was won by Earl Scheib's Saros Brig, who led all the way under 
Pat Valenzuela to beat favored Royal Touch by 1 3/4 lengths in the mile grass 
race before a crowd of 33,917. 
</P>
<P>
Saros Brig has won four times, twice in stakes, since Dominick Manzi began 
training him. Joe Manzi, Dominick's father, died of a heart attack last April 
and some of Scheib's horses were left with the son. 
</P>
<P>
Saros Brig was timed in 1:34 1/5, paid $21 and earned $68,100. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay had back-to-back winners Sunday, giving him 2,545 and breaking 
Bill Shoemaker's record for Santa Anita. Pincay resumed riding Saturday after 
being out about a month with a broken collarbone. . . . Under a substitute 
rider, Olympic Prospect ran fifth as the 3-10 favorite Sunday in the $100,000 
Phoenix Gold Cup at Turf Paradise. Master Dad won the stake, paying $86.20. 
Alex Solis, scheduled to ride Olympic Prospect, had airline difficulties from 
Los Angeles and was replaced by Craig McGurn. 
</P>
<P>
Tsu's Dawning, who ran third as the 3-10 favorite in the Santa Catalina on Feb. 
7, is one of six horses entered for the $75,000 Bradbury Stakes for 3-year-olds 
on Wednesday at Santa Anita. Tsu's Dawning's sire, Tsunami Slew, won the 
Bradbury in 1984. Others running in the 1 1/8-mile race are expected to be 
Video Ranger, Assyrian Pirate, Senegalaise, Heisman and T.V. Rebel. . . . Two 
of Florida's top 3-year-olds, Red Ransom and Polish Numbers, didn't run 
Saturday in races at Gulfstream Park. Polish Numbers was bothered by a cough.

MARTIN FINED $40,000 BUT WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
NASCAR handed out the biggest fine in stock car history Sunday night when Mark 
Martin's Ford Thunderbird was found to have an illegal engine part three hours 
after it won the Pontiac 400 at the Richmond (Va.) International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
The team was fined $40,000 and 46 points in the standings when a spacer between 
the carburetor and intake manifold was found to be a half-inch too tall. NASCAR 
rules limit the height of the spacer to two inches. Martin's was 2 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if it's an advantage or not," said Winston Cup Competition 
Director Dick Beaty. "The rule is to make sure the carburetor and air filter 
fit under the hood." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was allowed to keep the victory, but will take home only $19,150 of his 
$59,150 earnings. 
</P>
<P>
He left the raceway before learning his car had flunked technical inspection. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had won the race when his crew changed just the right-side tires of his 
Ford Thunderbird with 15 laps left. 
</P>
<P>
"There was four choices: two tires on the left, two tires on the right, four 
tires or stay out," Martin said. "The guys made the right choice." 
</P>
<P>
Other challengers changed all four tires. 
</P>
<P>
The move got Martin out of the pits first, and he pulled away from Dale 
Earnhardt over the final 15 laps to win the 400-lap event. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest previous fine came in 1983, when Richard Petty was assessed $35,000 
after his winning car at Charlotte, N.C., was found to have an oversized engine 
and illegal tires. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Brabham, Chip Robinson and Bob Earl combined to win the attrition-filled 
Miami Grand Prix, racing to a one-lap victory in a Nissan prototype. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham and Robinson won at Miami for the second consecutive time, with 
Brabham, who started from the pole for the fourth straight year, winning on the 
downtown street circuit for the third time in four years.

LOS ANGELES MARATHON; 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLES' RUN CONTRIBUTES MUCH TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Why is the Los Angeles Marathon called the Peoples' Marathon, and 
what does it contribute to the city of Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: The marathon was designed to meet the runners' needs within the limits 
imposed by the size of the race and to provide a pageant for the city. More 
than one million spectators lined the route last year and another 160,000 
attended the festival at Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, runners raised more than $600,000 in pledges in 1989 and 
organizers hope to top the one million mark this year in the only such charity 
program in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why does the L.A. marathon have trouble attracting name runners? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Boston Marathon, which began in 1897, is the grandfather of marathons 
and has the advantage of tradition over Los Angeles, and both Boston and New 
York offer hefty appearance fees and prizes to attract the elite runners. 
</P>
<P>
However, race organizers expect to be able to offer competitive prizes and fees 
to attract a stronger field by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What considerations were taken when the course was laid out? 
</P>
<P>
A: The course is laid out in circular form to negate the effect of wind and to 
comply with course standards recognized by the Athletic Congress for record 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers wanted the race to encompass as much of L.A.'s ethnic mix along the 
route as possible but were hampered by the limitations of the 26-mile, 385-yard 
course. New York has an advantage over Los Angeles in this area because it is 
relatively compact and can pass through the five boroughs in the course. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where is the best spot to watch the marathon? 
</P>
<P>
A: That depends on the spectator's individual tastes. The start can be viewed 
from the east side of Figueroa Blvd. north of the start line, but 
entertainment, ranging from rock music on Hollywood Blvd. to gospel and jazz 
groups in Crenshaw, are provided along the route for those who find a marathon 
less than thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
Those fans who wish to see the finish can do so at the Coliseum's east entrance 
in Exposition Park and KCOP is providing live coverage starting at 8 a.m. on 
race day. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What are the problems with a race this big? 
</P>
<P>
A: The biggest problem for race organizers is dealing with both the number of 
runners and the area the event covers. Over 20,000 runners consume six 40-foot 
truckloads of fruit, frozen yogurt and ice cream, and drink 18,750 gallons of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Crowd control will be handled by more than 300 Explorer scouts and 118 police 
officers with 1,300 feet of barricades while 392 traffic officers will also be 
assigned to the course. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What time does the race start and when does it end? 
</P>
<P>
A: The race walkers start at 8:05 a.m., followed by the wheelchair division at 
8:15 and the main body of the race starts at 8:35. 
</P>
<P>
The streets will reopen at 2:30 p.m. and any runners still on the course must 
move to the curb and obey regular traffic laws. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the maximum number of runners the marathon could accommodate? 
</P>
<P>
A: There isn't an estimate of the maximum number that the marathon could 
accommodate, but the main difficulty with the large number of participants is 
at the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
The runners are divided into six groups by their expected finishing time, with 
only the elite runners in the first group on the actual starting line. 
Unfortunately, with a field this large, the last runners get off the starting 
line when the first group is already 2 1/2 miles into the race. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers are considering using two parallel streets for the start, which is 
what the New York marathon does to handle its 23,000 runners, but even with the 
dual start the New York marathon may have to reduce its number of entries. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is cost to the marathon per runner? 
</P>
<P>
A: Organizers stopped calculating the cost about a year ago but estimate that 
each runner receives over $200 in services for a $25 entry fee. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do the organizers prevent cheating? 
</P>
<P>
A: Organizers have placed video monitors at various points along the route to 
prevent a recurrence of the Rosie Ruiz incident, which marred the 1980 Boston 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz was stripped of the women's title when it was discovered that she had 
entered the race some time after the mid-way point. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is the effect of weather on the marathon, and how did the race 
organizers select the date of the race? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally marathoners prefer a dry day with low humidity and temperatures in 
the 45-50-degree range. 
</P>
<P>
Race organizers consulted the U.S. Weather Service and selected the first 
Sunday after winter that was historically free of potential for rain but was 
also relatively cool. 
</P>
<P>
This system almost backfired in 1986 when it rained the day before the race for 
the first time in 35 years, but the skies cleared in time for the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Smog conditions are also relatively mild at this time of year because of wind 
conditions and shouldn't play a large role in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What does the runner get for the entry fee? 
</P>
<P>
A: Aside from the opportunity to compete in the marathon, each runner receives 
a bag with 66 items (with 20,000 runners that works out to 1,452,000 items), 
and Los Angeles Marathon finisher medallions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition there is more than $250,000 in cash and merchandise available for 
prizes in the open division categories. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How many volunteers take part in the marathon? 
</P>
<P>
A: More than 15,000 volunteers donate services. That includes 325 radio 
operators at quarter-mile intervals who provide a radio network that covers the 
entire course. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is "carbo-loading" and what does it do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Carbo-loading is a technique runners use to build up stores of muscle 
glycogen by significantly increasing carbohydrate intake several days before 
the marathon. The body relies on those glycogen stores during the marathon, and 
a runner hits "the wall" when their glycogen is depleted. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How much weight does a runner lose and how much water does he or she need? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unfortunately for those looking for a way to shed a few extra pounds most of 
the weight lost in the course of a marathon is perspiration that is easily 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The average marathoner needs about 1 1/2 cups of water per mile on a day of 
moderate heat and humidity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How long will the streets involved be closed? 
</P>
<P>
A: The organizers received permission to close the streets involved from 8:30 
a.m. until 2:30 p.m.

Guess? vs. Jordache Trial Begins: A bitter dispute between two rival jeans 
makers went to trial in Superior Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The four Marciano brothers who created the trendy jeans of the 1980s at Guess? 
Inc. seek damages from the three Nakash brothers, founders of Jordache 
Enterprises Ltd. In an earlier trial, a jury found the Marcianos and Guess were 
defrauded in a 1983 partnership agreement signed with the Nakashes. This jury 
will determine if damages are owed to the Marcianos. The Nakashes charge that 
the Marcianos filed the suit out of their own "seller's remorse." (Filed Nov. 
29, 1984; Case No. C524347)

ABC Sued for $50 Million Over Home Video Show: A writer who says ABC stole his 
idea when it created "America's Funniest Home Videos" filed a $50-million suit 
Wednesday in Superior Court, claiming that he was defrauded by the ABC network, 
Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. and others. 
</P>
<P>
The suit by Joseph Kaufman said he developed the idea of using amateur home 
videotape on television and had an oral contract to try out the concept on the 
syndicated one-hour "Wil Shriner Show" in November, 1987. ABC declined comment 
on the suit. (Filed Feb. 21; Case No. C752902)

Boeing to Help Those Laid Off: The Boeing Co. for the first time will offer to 
help find jobs for the 2,500 employees that it expects to lay off this spring. 
Boeing will open two out-placement centers early next month to prepare its 
laid-off workers to re-enter the job market, the company said. Last month 
Boeing announced that it will trim 5,000 jobs from its payroll this year, most 
from its Everett, Wash., plant.

The winds of reform are blowing through the Vietnamese economy, buffeting even 
such pillars of state enterprise as the venerable Hanoi Brewery. 
</P>
<P>
Situated in an industrial suburb of the capital, the peeling beige factory is a 
relic of the colonial days, when beer was the exclusive preserve of French brew 
masters. The brewery was taken over by the communist regime in 1954, when the 
French left, and began a long slide into inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
As with most Vietnamese enterprises, the brewery's financial world was turned 
upside down in 1986, when the Communist Party unveiled a reform program called 
doi moi, creating a free market, ending subsidies to state firms, devaluing the 
beleaguered Vietnamese currency and adopting "a socialist system of 
accounting," meaning that companies were now expected to make a profit or they 
would be allowed to go bust. 
</P>
<P>
The transition has been especially rough at the Hanoi Brewery, where the 
managing director at the time doi moi was announced committed suicide after 
charges of corruption were leveled. But factory officials now believe that he 
was falsely accused by workers afraid of his reformist ways. 
</P>
<P>
Another storm that broke over the brewery came from Vietnam's northern 
neighbor, China. With relations improving between the two communist 
governments, a flood of Chinese goods crossed the border. Faced with 
competition for the first time, a number of Vietnamese firms went to the wall. 
</P>
<P>
The tide of goods from the north included Wanlipiju, a beer in a familiar green 
bottle. The Chinese beer was not only better tasting then Hanoi beer; it was 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Dinh Thi Lanh, deputy director of the Hanoi Brewery, acknowledges that sales 
collapsed, from 36 million liters in 1988 to 28.5 million in 1989. Lanh tries 
to put a brave face on the problem, blaming the reduction on a scarcity of raw 
materials rather than competition. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, all of the brewery's raw materials had to be imported from 
Czechoslovakia through government middlemen, Lanh said. Now, the factory can 
import these materials from Czechoslovakia on its own. 
</P>
<P>
The beer's flavor seems slightly soapy to the Western palate. And "it's true 
that people rushed to try Chinese beer" at first, Lanh said. "But they prefer 
the taste of Vietnamese beer and have come back to us," he added. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Chinese, who cut prices by 20%, the Hanoi Brewery faced 
increased competition from breweries in southern Vietnam. One brewer has 
introduced a brand called "Bino," which comes in an aluminum can and is 
described by a Western diplomat as a "very respectable beer." 
</P>
<P>
"We're facing all kinds of competition," Lanh said. "Productivity is still very 
low. We're worried." 
</P>
<P>
The Hanoi Brewery dealt with last year's sales crisis in a manner that seems 
more socialist than capitalist. It reduced its sales of beer in kegs and 
increased sales of bottled beer. Bottles, Lanh pointed out, are more 
labor-intensive, thus the work force was saved from any heavy cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The brewery still does not know whether it makes a profit, because until last 
June the factory received a government subsidy, and management has not yet 
figured out whether it has reached the break-even point. But bottled-beer sales 
pushed gross revenue last year to $7.8 million (33 billion dong) from $6.4 
million (27 billion dong) the year before. 
</P>
<P>
Because the demand for beer is so great -- one benefit of the economic 
changeover is that Vietnamese consumers now have more money to spend -- the 
brewery can sell every bottle that it produces. 
</P>
<P>
One way it is increasing revenue is by attempting to go up market. It has 
introduced a beer called Truc Bach, which is brewed 15 days longer than the 
Hanoi brand and has 2% more alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
With sales so brisk, the factory does not have to worry about layoffs. Only 
four workers have been fired since dismissals became permissible last August. 
Lanh said the four had insulted customers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lanh, the factory wants to expand capacity but does not have the 
resources. It hopes to make a deal with a Western firm, perhaps a West German 
brewery, for long-range cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
While such a deal may be in the offing, a Western economist noted that 
Vietnamese managers have begun to pin all their hopes on outside assistance, 
which has yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the country faces a serious credit squeeze. To choke off inflation from 
700% a year to the current 24%, banks raised interest rates sharply. While the 
rates have eased, it is still cripplingly expensive for a company to borrow. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, "things are really improving in a lot of state enterprises," the 
economist said.

Gas Prices Edge Down: Motorists are paying a half-cent less for gasoline than 
they were two weeks ago, said industry analyst Trilby Lundberg. The average 
price of all grades of gasoline at retail stations fell 0.52 cents per gallon 
between Feb. 9 and Feb. 23, to $1.1221 per gallon, according to Lundberg. The 
decrease followed a decline of 0.60 cents per gallon recorded during the 
previous two-week reporting period.

MACHINE TOOL ORDERS DROP 4.2% IN JANUARY

Machine tool orders fell 4.2% in January to $197.6 million, the National 
Machine Tool Builders' Assn. said Sunday in its monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for the industrial tools totaled $206.3 million in December. 
</P>
<P>
The association said machine tool shipments fell 40.9% last month to $224.1 
million from $379.4 million in December. The decline was in part a reflection 
of the normal seasonal year-end surge in shipments. 
</P>
<P>
"Machine tool activity in January was in line with that of recent months," 
association president Albert W. Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Machine tool orders fell 14.4% from January, 1989, but shipments rose 47.2%. 
Machine tools, such as lathes, make the machines that produce sophisticated 
weapons and other manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said although many economists predict a slowdown in the U.S economy, 
several trends independent of the business cycle point to potential demand for 
machine tools. 
</P>
<P>
They include high backlogs in the aerospace sector, the need to replace farm 
machinery and the increasingly urgent need to "rebuild much of our nation's 
aging infrastructure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The trade group reported that the machine tool order backlog for January was 
$1.78 billion, compared to $1.80 billion in December and $2.27 billion in 
January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-cutting machine tool orders fell 11.1% to $140.9 million in January and 
were down 15.6% from a year ago. Metal-cutting equipment shipments fell 48.1% 
to $162.25 million but rose 57.8% from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The association said metal-forming orders rose 18.7% to $56.70 million but were 
off 11.2% from January, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-forming shipments dropped 7.1% in January to $61.9 million but rose 25.3% 
from the year-ago period.

DREXEL OWES MILLIONS IN LEGAL FEES

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. owes millions of dollars to lawyers who helped 
defend the collapsed Wall Street firm and its employees during the government's 
lengthy insider trading investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Atop the list is Drexel's main outside counsel, which has claims to $2.1 
million in back fees, and attorneys for indicted junk bond ex-king Michael 
Milken, whose monthly allowance of about $1 million wound down when Drexel went 
belly up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are outstanding fees they haven't paid and they're not going to pay 
anything going forward," said a Milken associate who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
When Drexel became entangled in the largest Wall Street criminal probe ever, 
the firm promised to pick up the tab for all current or former employees who 
became involved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the demise of the firm that dominated Wall Street's junk bond deal 
making is affecting big law firms that derived a large amount of work from 
Drexel's criminal woes and its day-to-day securities business. 
</P>
<P>
A slowdown on Wall Street -- investment banking firms need lawyers for 
activities from underwriting stocks to completing mergers -- hasn't helped 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Meltzer, a partner with Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, which has 
represented Drexel for 10 years, conceded that Drexel's demise would hurt, but 
added that the firm has a "substantial and diverse client base." The firm 
reportedly did about $10 million in Drexel business a year. Cahill Gordon said 
in court papers that it is owed $2.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
"This firm is not based on the financial health of one client," Meltzer 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel said it spent $75 million on legal fees associated with its criminal and 
civil troubles last year, when it pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid $500 
million of $650 million owed in government penalties. A mountain of litigation 
spawned by Drexel's behavior still is outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said backed-up legal bills "will be dealt with 
in due course" but he didn't know how much was owed. Anreder said Drexel had 
for the time stopped paying for individuals' new legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Drexel reportedly owes Milken attorneys -- mostly at the New York firm Paul, 
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison -- back pay for three or four months, 
consistent with what other firms representing Drexel people claim is due.

Few stocks have suffered the beating that National Education Corp. has taken 
over the past year. Now, there's some interesting activity in the stock that 
suggests it might be an attractive buy for speculators. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, San Francisco investment bankers Richard C. Blum &amp; Associates 
said it had picked up 273,180 more shares in Irvine-based NEC during the past 
two months. That brought Blum's stake to 1.2 million shares, or 4.2%. A Blum 
client, which the firm won't name, has another 582,830 shares previously 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
The Blum announcement helped push NEC stock up $1.125 for the week, to $6.125 
-- a 23% gain. 
</P>
<P>
NEC had been a hot stock for much of the 1980s. As the leading U.S. operator of 
technical and industrial training schools and a big supplier of 
independent-study job training materials, the firm was riding the wave of the 
nation's industrial restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
But things began to go awry last spring, when NEC ran into trouble digesting 
some of the aggressive acquisitions it had made. Last March, Jerome Cwiertnia 
quit as president. Two months later, Chief Executive H. David Bright disclosed 
that revenues were slumping while expenses were rising. Red ink began to flow, 
and soon Bright was out and NEC's directors brought Cwiertnia back to run the 
company as president. The third quarter saw more red ink; fourth-quarter 
results are due perhaps this week. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street thinks NEC might earn 20 cents a share this year as it slowly works 
out the problems of integrating sales forces of key units. It helps that the 
company's banks in December agreed to refinance $62 million in debt. But NEC 
still must raise at least $10 million in new capital this year to shore up its 
balance sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Questionable as the outlook may appear, however, Blum's group raised its stake 
because it sees NEC as a great value "for a long-term investor," said Alexander 
Hehmeyer, managing director. The group isn't looking to take over the company, 
he said, noting that Richard Blum sits on NEC's board. 
</P>
<P>
Two other big investors also hold major stakes and have bought more over the 
past year, said NEC Corporate Secretary J. A. Brill: Templeton Galbraith, a 
Bahamas-based money management firm, has more than 10%; BEA Associates of New 
York has over 5%. 
</P>
<P>
NEC could become a fantastic turnaround story if it works out its problems. 
Even so, this is one for gamblers only -- given that the extent of NEC's 
internal troubles may not yet be known. Plus, the stock's comeback may take a 
long time. "It's easy to fall off a cliff," Hehmeyer said. "It takes a lot 
longer to climb back up."

The Case for Broad: With mixed success, insurance firm Broad Inc. is trying to 
escape being mentioned in the same breath with First Executive Corp. Both Los

instruments. But analyst Fred Wise at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. says the 
similarities end there.

First Executive invested heavily in junk bonds and now is paying for it. Broad, 
meanwhile, "is very conservatively managed" and is thriving, Wise said. 
Long-term junk bonds represented just 4.9% of Broad's investments at Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
CEO Eli Broad is targeting the firm's annuity products at the baby boom 
generation, a group just beginning to save money in large sums. The lure of 
annuities: You earn 8% to 8.5% yields, and the return is tax-deferred until you 
pull the money out. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Broad Inc. spun off its home building arm, Kaufman &amp; Broad, to 
concentrate solely on financial services. Late last year, Broad agreed to buy 
the life insurance and asset management operations of bankrupt Integrated 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns' Wise said the Integrated deal "may be the acquisition of the 
decade. . . . It's a true strategic fit for Broad." He expects Broad to earn 
$1.20 a share this year from operations, versus 80 cents last year. If he's 
right, Broad stock looks exceedingly cheap. The shares have fallen to $8.875 
from $12 in December, as investors have dumped everything that even remotely 
resembles a First Executive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit frustrating," Eli Broad admits, "but one recognizes that the market 
is not always rational." 
</P>
<P>
BROAD INC.

<P>
Friday: $8.875 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Wall Street continues to rotate money out of consumer goods stocks and 
into industrial stocks, apparently betting on a healthy appetite for industrial 
goods later this year. The opening of Eastern European markets may be a key 
reason. Last week, while the broad market slumped, Bethlehem Steel added 12.5 
cents to $17.625; Deere rose $1.125 to $67.75.

HOW SMART DEALING, BORROWED BUCKS MADE BIG PROFIT FOR BASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
When you're a very smart billionaire, even deals that seem a little crummy turn 
out to be very, very profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, if you will, the tale of Robert M. Bass, the Ft. Worth zillionaire, 
and his takeover of one of the country's biggest troubled savings and loan 
associations, American Savings Bank of Irvine. American, you may remember, was 
owned by Financial Corp. of America, the nation's largest S&amp;L, now a 
bankrupt hulk. 
</P>
<P>
When American disclosed its 1989 earnings, those of us in the financial voyeur 
business began to worry about Bass, who has parlayed a large inherited fortune 
into an enormous fortune by successfully playing corporate takeover games. 
</P>
<P>
Bass seemed to have made less than 40% last year on his American Savings 
investment. True, the bank earned a nice $215 million on its $16 billion of 
assets. But because Bass owns only 70% of American -- the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. owns the rest -- his share of the profit was a crummy $150 
million. Divide that by the $400 million that Bass invested in American, and he 
made a mere 37.5%. 
</P>
<P>
For most of us, of course, 37.5% isn't mere. But for the Basses of the world, 
that's passbook savings money. Especially considering that Bass made his deal 
with M. Danny Wall, head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who was holding a 
garage sale in late 1988, shoveling dead S&amp;Ls and income tax benefits out 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
Fear not for Bass. When you figure out what he really made on his real 
investment, he earned more than 150% on his investment last year. That's more 
like it. 
</P>
<P>
Bass' paper profit last year, being very conservative, was $223 million to 
$310.5 million on an investment of $150 million. Bass earned this bonanza 
despite having been shafted by the government, which decided after he had 
plunked down his dough that he would have to add $240 million to American's 
capital. The government going back on its word to Bass is one reason that no 
one with money has been buying dead S&amp;Ls at the government's current 
remnant sale, run by the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
But despite everything, Bass has still managed to make a fortune on American. 
His secret: smart dealing and borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
Bass, it turns out, borrowed $250 million of the $400 million that he put into 
American. When you slog your way through all the numbers, you discover that 
American paid out $75 million of its 1989 profit to a Bass holding company to 
cover interest on the borrowed money and to give the FDIC its agreed-on 75% of 
Bass' income tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
That left a $140-million profit. Bass' 70% is $98 million -- a return of 65% on 
his $150-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
But wait, there's more. 
</P>
<P>
Bass, remember, owns 70% of American, which is a very profitable institution 
now that the government has taken responsibility for the bad loans and idiotic 
interest rate gambles that sank the old American. 
</P>
<P>
The Bass people, who would rather the world didn't recognize how good their 
American Savings deal is, didn't want to talk to me about their deal. No one 
wants to be hauled in front of the House Banking Committee, which let the 
S&amp;L problem fester for years, and now wants to pillory anyone who has made 
a dime from it. 
</P>
<P>
If you take the numbers that Bass' people have given members of the financial 
community -- numbers that I feel are too low -- you see that American Savings 
ought to net at least $125 million a year after making its income-tax-savings 
payments to FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
In today's market, the shares of such an S&amp;L should sell for at least six 
or seven times annual earnings -- or $750 million to $875 million. 
</P>
<P>
Give Bass his 70% share of that, do the math I've done in the table 
accompanying this article, and you see that Bass' stock is worth $125 million 
to $212.5 million more than his investment. Plus, of course, there's his 
$98-million share of the 1989 profit. 
</P>
<P>
But Bass is a piker compared to what Ronald O. Perelman, the New York-based 
takeover tycoon, has made on his S&amp;L investment. Perelman made an 
$800-million paper profit last year on a $160-million investment. 
</P>
<P>
The difference involves income taxes. Because the payments the government makes 
to cover losses on the bad assets that Perelman and Bass inherited in their 
S&amp;Ls are tax-exempt, both of their S&amp;Ls have huge tax losses. Perelman 
can use those losses to shelter income produced by Revlon and other companies 
that he owns. I think Ford Motor Co.'s S&amp;L deal works the same way. 
</P>
<P>
But Bass' deal, as best I can tell, allows him to shelter nothing but American 
Savings' profits. He can't shelter Bell &amp; Howell's profits with them. So, 
even though Bass racked up $1.2 billion of tax losses by my estimate last year, 
he could use only $215 million of them. He may be able to use the rest of the 
losses someday, but I haven't counted them in my calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Bass has made a huge profit from the S&amp;L debacle that we and 
our descendants will pay for until the end of time, you shouldn't be angry with 
him. He bid for American Savings, fair and square, against other potential 
buyers, and no one made the government deal with him. You should remember, too, 
that Bass was willing to risk taking an $8-billion promissory note -- now one 
of American Savings' assets -- from a federal agency that auditors had said was 
insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
You can't blame the Basses, the Perelmans and the Ford Motors for making good 
deals for themselves. That's their job. What the federal government's job is, 
God only knows. 
</P>
<P>
BASS NETS NICE HAUL 
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Bass has done very nicely with his investment in American Savings 
Bank, a big, troubled S&amp;L that he took over in late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
American's 1989 profit was: $215 million 
</P>
<P>
Less interest, expense and FDIC payments of: $75 million 
</P>
<P>
Left this for Bass to split with the FDIC: $140 million 
</P>
<P>
Bass' 70% share was: $98 million 
</P>
<P>
Which gave a profit of: 65% 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't count the value of Bass' stock in American Savings. Add the 
stock's estimated value and you get the following: 
</P>
<P>
His stock is worth at least: $525 million to $612 million 
</P>
<P>
Plus his share of 1989's profit of: $98 million 
</P>
<P>
Less borrowed money of: $250 million 
</P>
<P>
Less his investment of: $150 million 
</P>
<P>
Leaves him this far ahead: $223 million to $310.5 million 
</P>
<P>
Which gives him a profit of: 149% to 207% 
</P>

MOSCOW TENSE AS 100,000 ATTEND OPPOSITION RALLY 
</P>

<P>
Central Moscow looked like a capital under occupation Sunday as subway stations 
closed, traffic halted and thousands of troops in riot gear guarded government 
buildings and encircled demonstrators rallying in opposition to the Communist 
Party and in support of faster reform. 
</P>
<P>
In more than four hours of speeches under gray skies, progressives applauded 
the estimated 100,000 people who attended the protest for defying government 
"scare tactics." They complained that since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the 
Communist Party has taken the country, as one banner proclaimed, "72 Years on 
the Road to Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the mood was low-key and the turnout far smaller than the up to 1 
million predicted. It indicated that a week of ominous warnings from the 
government, combined with heavy army and police presence, succeeded in 
intimidating many and persuading them to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern was followed in other Soviet cities. In Leningrad, only about 8,000 
people demonstrated after activists called on their supporters to boycott the 
city's rally because authorities refused to give them permission to demonstrate 
on a central street. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people demonstrated in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, with many 
would-be protesters reportedly going to the wrong places because official media 
refused to broadcast the plans for the city's rally. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities banned planned rallies in at least 10 other cities, according 
to the semiofficial Novosti news agency. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, police used snowplows and sand-filled dump trucks to block access to 
the Kremlin. They also closed to traffic much of the Garden Ring Road, which 
encircles the city, as protesters met in two places -- at Gorky Park and 
outside the Foreign Ministry -- and then marched along the road to a central, 
joint meeting place at Zubovsky Square. 
</P>
<P>
About 17,000 Interior Ministry troops and at least several thousand additional 
Red Army soldiers blocked alleys as well as main roads, government office 
buildings and entrances to subway stations. They carried gas masks, plastic 
shields and truncheons. Several water cannon were stationed near the Foreign 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
The rally began slowly, almost cautiously, and picked up steam only near the 
end. 
</P>
<P>
As speakers complained about the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
perestroika reforms, the crowd chanted "Resign! Resign!" One homemade banner 
read: "Gorbachev and Company: Leave." Others read: "Communism Is a Cancerous 
Tumor" and "The People's Army Against Party Bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the speakers complained about dire warnings from the Supreme Soviet, 
the national Parliament; the Communist Party Central Committee, and by official 
media that had said the rally would not be safe for children, that "criminal 
elements" could take control of events and that authorities would respond 
harshly. 
</P>
<P>
"We came here in good spirits to demand radical changes in our country," said 
progressive legislator Yuri Afanasyev. "But the government has tried to ruin 
our mood. It has used scare tactics to try to persuade people not to come out 
on the streets. . . . We are here, nevertheless." 
</P>
<P>
Another speaker, legislator Gavriil Popov, told the crowd: "All was against us. 
The City Council was late in announcing the site, time, routes. Television has 
special entertainment shows on." 
</P>
<P>
The government-run Soviet television on Sunday morning showed a Polish film, 
"The Sex Mission," complete with nudity, in an apparent effort to keep people 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev, Popov and others said the turnout would have been greater if they 
had been given a chance to tell people on television or radio that their rally 
would be peaceful. They contended that the refusal to allow them to speak was 
an attempt to silence progressive candidates running for office in the Russian 
republic's Parliament in March 4 balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin put tremendous effort into trying to curtail the rally, its 
organizers said, because party officials were surprised by the success of a 
Feb. 4 demonstration. That protest, attended by an estimated 200,000 people, 
was the largest demonstration of its kind in the capital since the Bolshevik 
Revolution. It was held with official authorization to call for the end of the 
Communist Party's monopoly on power -- a move that was supported by Gorbachev 
and endorsed within three days by the party's Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Sunday's demonstration seemed an expression of deeper anger with 
Gorbachev and the party -- frustration that went beyond simply a desire to 
share power. 
</P>
<P>
Reforms that speakers called for included legalizing private property, holding 
direct presidential elections and taking state-run media out of party control. 
</P>
<P>
"There is corruption everywhere, even within the church," said one of the 
protesters, a 60-year-old priest named Victor Pichujkin. "Gorbachev isn't 
listening to us, so I decided to come out on the streets. At least here, I have 
a chance to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
Some speakers complained about the poor living standard in the Soviet Union, 
with low pensions, empty store shelves and inadequate health service. "Our 
country is the poorest in Europe," declared one speaker. 
</P>
<P>
One radical legislator, Sergei Kuznetsov, complained that the Communist Party 
had "in the past sucked our strength so we could not oppose them." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, he said, "the deputies in the Congress of People's Deputies (the 
national legislature) perform a show aimed at preserving the power of the 
party." 
</P>
<P>
It is time for the people to join together to "fight the party Mafia . . . the 
totalitarian Bolshevik government that exists today, even under Gorbachev."

OIL WASHES INTO WETLANDS AS SPILL BARRIER COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what officials call the worst environmental damage since the Feb. 7 oil 
spill from a tanker off Huntington Beach, an earthen dam built to protect a 
sensitive wetlands area collapsed Sunday under a high tide and heavy surf, 
allowing large amounts of crude to wash over the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Work crews late Sunday hastened to restore the berm, but Huntington Beach Fire 
Chief Ray Picard said untold damage already had been done. 
</P>
<P>
While no exact assessment has been made, Picard said early estimates are that 
mousse-like globs of brown oil covered 5% of the wetlands, while an oily sheen 
could be seen over much of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of British Petroleum, owners of the 394,000 gallons of Alaskan crude 
that spilled from the tanker, said Sunday that tests were being performed on 
the oil to determine if it was from the vessel. The firm had been involved in 
what it described as its final mop-up of the major spill when Sunday's setback 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a severe blow," Picard said. "From an environmental standpoint, this is 
the worst that has happened since the spill." 
</P>
<P>
The damage to wildlife was also difficult to tally. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the discovery, members of a local environmental group dedicated 
to the preservation of the so-called Huntington Beach Wetlands rescued two 
oil-covered birds and deployed volunteers in boats to search for any more in 
the seven islands that constitute the preserve. Scores of rock-clinging mussels 
could be seen blackened with oil along a channel leading to the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here this morning, the fish were jumping like crazy trying to get 
out of the oil," Louann Murray, a member of the Huntington Beach Conservancy 
environmental group, said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The wetlands encompass a 25-acre saltwater marsh near the Santa Ana River mouth 
that is part of the Pacific flyway for migrating waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
Restored last year after being partially filled in since the 1950s, the region 
is home to crabs, fish, shore birds and coastal plants. Among the creatures is 
the endangered Belding's Savannah sparrow. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the tanker American Trader ruptured on its anchor while attempting 
to unload at an underwater mooring terminal, authorities have struggled to keep 
the oil out of wetlands areas between Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Using earthen dams, sandbags and containment booms, the efforts had been 
largely successful until shortly before 9 a.m. Sunday, when a six-foot tide 
strengthened by six-foot waves created a tidal surge that raced up the Talbert 
Channel leading to the Huntington Beach Wetlands. The onslaught destroyed an 
eight-foot earthen dike that had been reinforced by hundreds of sandbags. A 
dozen absorbent booms placed on both sides of the dike were also broken to 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
After the dike broke, a five-foot wall of water roared into the wetlands, 
situated about 200 yards inland and just north of the Santa Ana River, said 
Victor Leipzig, a Huntington Beach city planner and Cypress College biology 
professor who has been heading up the volunteer rescue efforts following the 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
The dam collapsed in full view of Leipzig and scores of spill cleanup workers, 
powerless to do anything to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the damage, Leipzig said all seven islands in the wetlands were 
surrounded by "bathtub-like" oil rings. He declined to speculate on the 
potential damage, although state and federal officials have said that cleaning 
oil from a wetlands area is so difficult that oily residue could linger for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-foot high dike had been designed to withstand an average tide. 
Sunday's tide was six feet above average, and the highest of the month, Picard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Dalquist, an Orange County engineer who designed the dam, said he and 
other officials had been forewarned Saturday about the predicted high tides for 
Sunday, but had no idea that the surf would be so strong. 
</P>
<P>
As tidal waters receded late Sunday morning, work crews supervised by British 
Petroleum officials moved bulldozers and other heavy equipment into place to 
rebuild the dam. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum officials said they could not estimate how long it would take 
to clean up the latest mess. 
</P>
<P>
"It will put us a little behind schedule," said British Petroleum spokeswoman 
Marcia Meermans. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some concern that this (oil) may have been from an upstream source," 
Meermans said. "Nonetheless, we have people on scene." 
</P>
<P>
The petroleum company had been in what it described as its final mop-up of the 
Orange County coastline with the goal of reopening to the public 10 miles of 
beaches closed between Huntington Beach and Newport Beach. There was no 
indication Sunday when that might be.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serious and patient, Nicaraguan voters turned out in large numbers Sunday to 
choose between the decade-old Sandinista government and a U.S.-backed coalition 
in the most contentious election in their country's history. 
</P>
<P>
The voting, aimed at ending eight years of guerrilla war, was reported 
relatively peaceful throughout Nicaragua. However, election officials said 
eight of the 4,391 polling stations failed to open and that two others were 
hastily transferred because of military activity by U.S.-backed Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Sandinistas and the 14-party National Opposition Union (UNO) reported 
what they called insignificant numbers of election law violations and said they 
felt buoyed by the big turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things have been going very smoothly," said former U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Elliot L. Richardson shortly after the polls closed at 6 p.m. "So far, the 
elections look fair." Richardson heads the U.N. observer mission and is one of 
more than 2,000 accredited vote monitors. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega said after casting his ballot in Managua that he was 
certain of winning another six-year term and would invite President Bush to his 
inauguration. A notice posted at Sandinista campaign headquarters urged 
supporters to gather for a midnight victory rally. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect that the government of the United States will recognize the results 
of the elections and work for peace with Nicaragua," Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the newspaper publisher who is the strongest of 
Ortega's nine challengers, expressed her "faith in God and my people that 
Nicaraguans will vote for a change." 
</P>
<P>
Voters leaving the polls echoed both predictions with a certainty and emotion 
that reflected the highly charged expectations of a bitterly contested -- but 
surprisingly peaceful -- six-month campaign.

"God has pity on the Nicaraguan people, and He is going to change things," said 
Mercedes Maldonado, 85, of Managua, who voted for the first time in her life. 
Bursting into tears, she told of how five of her children had left Nicaragua 
and how her sixth is ailing and cannot afford medicine. "My heart told me to 
vote for UNO," she added. "We have to free ourselves from this hunger." 
</P>
<P>
Across the capital at a polling station near army headquarters, where scores of 
uniformed Sandinista soldiers lined up to cast ballots, Lt. Victor Brenis said 
he was voting for Ortega "to show imperialism that we have a democracy here." 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, 44, was first elected in 1984, five years after his Sandinista National 
Liberation Front seized power from President Anastasio Somoza to end 43 years 
of U.S.-backed dictatorship. Chamorro, 60, served nine months on the first 
Sandinista junta, then quit to turn her newspaper, La Prensa, into the 
country's leading opposition voice. 
</P>
<P>
For the Sandinistas, the election was an effort to prove the legitimacy of 
their revolution, end a decade of U.S. hostility and rebuild the country. UNO, 
an electoral alliance embracing both Communists and conservatives, saw the vote 
as a timely opportunity to repudiate what it calls a dictatorial system that 
has brought this fertile country of 3.5 million people to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Voters were choosing a president, a vice president, 90 members of a 
single-chamber National Assembly and, for the first time, 131 municipal 
councils. Two regional councils to govern the eastern part of the country, 
populated largely by English-speaking blacks and Miskito Indians, were also 
being elected. 
</P>
<P>
About 1.75 million voters, age 16 and older, signed up for the election during 
a four-week registration period last October. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson estimated the turnout at near 90%. 
</P>
<P>
Many voters stood in line all night, waiting for polls to open at 7 a.m., only 
to find the voting process sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Institute, the largest polling place in Managua, opened 1 hour and 
45 minutes late because just two election officials were on hand to start 
counting the 6,669 paper ballots. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited the school 
as an election observer, more officials were brought in. When the iron gate 
finally opened, two voters were injured in the stampede. 
</P>
<P>
"The people outside were legitimately concerned (about the delay)," Carter 
said. "But it will be done correctly even if it takes a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Voters cast separate ballots in three-sided cardboard booths bearing the 
promise "Your Vote Is Secret" in black letters. To prevent multiple voting, 
voters' right thumbs were dipped in ink. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very solemn, like a Mass," Carter said after watching election officials 
lay out ballots, registration books and ink on a table in one polling station. 
</P>
<P>
UNO's main complaint was that the ink, supposedly indelible, was easily washed 
off by many voters. But Richardson said, "I don't think it's a fatal flaw, 
because there are too many other checks in the system. It's not probable that 
the vote was affected in any significant way." 
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary evaluation, the opposition denounced irregularities at seven 
polling stations. It said Sandinista officials padded registration lists, 
allowed Sandinista soldiers to go ahead of other voters in line, obliged voters 
to show their ballots and annulled those marked for opposition candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders also charged that some of the polling stations affected by 
reported Contra activity were really kept closed to prevent voting in rural war 
zones in favor of UNO. Witness for Peace, a Washington-based group that 
monitors the Contras, said there had been no recent rebel activity near the 
polling station at El Toro, in Matagalpa province, where 1,300 people were kept 
from voting. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas, in turn, accused UNO supporters of violating the law against 
politicking at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But the complaints were overshadowed by optimism on both sides that the heavy 
turnout had favored their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The government invited observers from 160 foreign groups to monitor the vote, 
and they tried to cover most of the polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
Times reporters who visited rural areas of Chontales and Jinotega provinces 
recently infiltrated by the Contras encountered few international observers but 
saw large peaceful turnouts of eager voters, including unarmed Sandinista 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened in this country is that we Nicaraguans have become strangers 
to each other," said Fernando Giacom Gomez, a farmer in the village of El 
Ayote, in Chontales. "Whoever wins, what we need is peace." 
</P>
<P>
Carter said that if the election was judged to be fair, it would remove the 
rationale for any further American aid to the rebels or remove the government 
that the rebels oppose. Either result, he said, would permit the United States 
to end a five-year economic embargo and to normalize relations with a 
Nicaraguan government enjoying popular support. 
</P>
<P>
The election was the first in Nicaragua to be contested by all political 
forces. Amid dying prospects for a resumption of U.S. military aid to the 
Contras, which was cut off two years ago, several rebel leaders returned from 
exile to help found UNO last May, making it a broad anti-Sandinista coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Just once in Nicaragua's bloody history, in 1928, has power passed from one 
party to another through the ballot. Historically, elections were viewed as 
rigged instruments to perpetuate the party in power. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 election, which gave Ortega two-thirds of the vote, was marred by the 
pullout of the main U.S.-backed opposition bloc. Its leaders still claim that 
unfair campaign conditions made the Sandinistas unbeatable. But many of them, 
now in UNO, say their decision was an error that plunged the nation into its 
worst years of war. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Sandinista politicians were thrust to the front of the conflict in 
February, 1989, when a peace agreement among Central American presidents moved 
Nicaragua's 1990 elections forward by nine months in exchange for a plan, still 
unfulfilled, to close the Contra camps in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the 14-party coalition united behind Chamorro and received 
pledges of $3.3 million in U.S. government aid. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's campaign stressed the sacrifices of her slain husband, Pedro Joaquin 
Chamorro, the best-known victim of the struggle against Somoza. She appealed 
for reconciliation of a divided nation and called for an end to compulsory 
military service. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on Nicaragua's severe economic decline, which has cut real wages by 
more than 90% since 1981 and driven forced large numbers of people into 
poverty, Chamorro also promised an economic revival driven by greater freedom 
for private capital. 
</P>
<P>
Sandinista candidates, saying the crisis had been stabilized, blamed it on the 
Contra war and the U.S. embargo, rather than mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
And they used their economic battles with the United States to wage a 
nationalist campaign against Chamorro's American-financed coalition, calling 
her a stalking horse for yanqui imperialism. Sandinistas claimed that some UNO 
leaders were closely tied to the Somoza regime and the estimated 3,000 Contras 
still fighting inside Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega abandoned his olive-green uniform and stern bearing to stump vigorously 
across the country as a youthful populist. He danced the limbo, hugged babies, 
tossed baseballs into crowds and handed out land titles by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Adapting a U.S.-style campaign, his party outspent UNO, clothed much of the 
country with "Daniel for President" T-shirts and dominated the media and the 
billboards. It mustered the vast resources of the state to produce campaign 
rallies somewhat larger than those greeting Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
In the closing weeks of the race, Ortega pre-empted one of Chamorro's key 
campaign promises by freeing the last 1,190 prisoners condemned for crimes 
against the state. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro's campaign -- hampered in the closing weeks by a broken kneecap, the 
delayed arrival of U.S. funds and squabbling within her coalition -- appealed 
to voters to overcome their fear of "dictatorship" and believe in the secret 
ballot. UNO trained thousands of poll watchers to prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials said UNO was represented at nearly all of the polling 
places. But opposition leaders said some of their poll watchers were not 
allowed to sign off on all voting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Given the backdrop of guerrilla war, the campaign was remarkably civil. Four 
Sandinista campaign workers were killed by the Contras in January, and a UNO 
supporter died in December in the only one of hundreds of campaign rallies that 
was marred by a riot. 
</P>
<P>
"The key factor in the campaign that kept it on track was the conviction by 
each side that it could win," said Carter, who helped negotiate procedures for 
preventing violence after the December riot.

KOHL TRIES TO CALM FEARS OF UNITED GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought Sunday to reassure Europe and Western 
allies that a reunified Germany will not be a threat to peace, but he made 
clear that the pace of reunification will be decided by the Germans themselves, 
not by outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not 1945; this is 1990," Kohl said at one point during a joint press 
conference with President Bush after two days of meetings between the two men 
at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland north of Washington. "The 
question of German unity is a question of the right of self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
Political leaders from Moscow to London increasingly have been raising anxious 
questions about future German strength and intentions. Bush and his advisers, 
however, have been focusing their attention in a different direction. They have 
been emphasizing a need to maintain warm ties with Germany and to support Kohl 
at every turn in an attempt to head off any German move toward neutrality and 
the removal of U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
That aspect of the talks appears to have been successful. The two leaders 
agreed, Bush said, that Germany should remain within the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and its unified military command structure. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops, Kohl said, could remain on the soil of what is now East Germany 
during an undefined "transitional period," but in the long run, "a united 
Germany cannot belong to two different pact systems." East Germany belongs to 
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"Neutralism," said Kohl, "would be a very false illusion for us." Germany, he 
added, must be "ever more embedded" in a unified European structure "so nobody 
needs to be afraid." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, many of Germany's neighbors, having lost millions of people 
in the two world wars in which Germany was the aggressor, have been frightened 
by the prospect of a reunited German state. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials had hoped that Kohl would use the Camp David meeting 
to offer new statements to quell those fears. But at the press conference, held 
at Camp Greentop, a national park facility near Camp David, Kohl moved little 
beyond previous public statements. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the West German leader, whose domestic political base includes a 
powerful nationalist wing, remained carefully ambiguous on two of the most 
vexing questions -- Germany's future borders and the size of the country's army 
once the two German states become one. 
</P>
<P>
"We must understand that there are certain fears on the part of our neighbors," 
Kohl said. He noted that many of those fears are serious although some are 
"pretended fears" on the part of people whose real concern is German economic 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a certain history," Kohl said. "I think we have learned lessons, and 
we do not want to repeat the errors of history." 
</P>
<P>
But, showing the sensitivity that many Germans feel about the mistrust others 
still hold toward them, Kohl defended his country's postwar record. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of 40 years," he said, West Germany has been "a loyal and 
reliable partner in human rights and the defense of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has to tell me," he added, "what a reliable partner is." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, for his part, said that although he understands the concerns others have, 
he does not share them. "The U.S. position is that we welcome unification," he 
said. "Clearly, that would not be the position if we held the fears" expressed 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The fear expressed most often concerns Germany's eastern boundary. After World 
War II, the Soviet Union took over a large portion of eastern Poland, and 
Poland, in turn, took over a large chunk of what had been eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable minority within Germany would like to see those territories returned, 
and the Poles, with growing intensity, have expressed their worry that a newly 
reunified Germany might refuse to recognize the current border, which runs 
along the Oder and Niesse rivers. 
</P>
<P>
The United States recognizes the Oder-Niesse border as permanent, a point that 
Bush repeated Sunday. But Kohl, who faces strong competition from his Social 
Democratic rivals in elections scheduled for December, fears losing the votes 
of nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, therefore, has avoided making an unequivocal statement on the issue. Any 
final decision must await "a freely elected all-German Parliament government," 
he said Sunday, repeating his standard line on the issue. "Nobody has any 
intention of linking the question of national unity with changes of existing 
borders." 
</P>
<P>
Both men made clear that in the next round of talks over Germany's future -- 
the so-called two-plus-four talks among East and West Germany and the United 
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France, the four victors of World War II 
-- Poland would not be directly represented. 
</P>
<P>
But "no agreement would ever be reached that affects the Polish borders without 
Polish involvement," Bush said. "There will be a lot of consultative 
mechanisms." 
</P>
<P>
Another issue moving toward the forefront is the future size and role of 
Germany's armed forces. Since the early 1950s, the United States has urged 
Germany to build up its army, which has served as a major part of NATO's shield 
against the Soviets. East Germany, meanwhile, constructed a powerful army of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two German states have more than 750,000 soldiers, which, if 
combined, would be the second-largest European army after that of the Soviet 
Union. Germany has accepted some limits on those armed forces. Asked, for 
example, if Germany would ever seek to develop nuclear weapons, Kohl responded 
with a flat "no." 
</P>
<P>
But asked about the broader question of German troop strength, Kohl demurred. 
"I do hope that we Germans will profit" by the future development of European 
arms-limitation talks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What size army a future German state might want to keep, "I cannot tell you at 
all," Kohl added. 
</P>
<P>
Bush repeated his past declarations that U.S. troops will remain in Germany 
even if the Soviets withdraw all of their forces. The Soviet threat may have 
receded, he said, but now "the enemy is instability."

VAN DE KAMP OPENS GOVERNOR BID, TAKES AIM AT FEINSTEIN ON HER TURF; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HE LASHES OUT AT HIS RIVAL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION, SEEKING TO 
CONTRAST THEIR POLITICAL PERSONALITIES.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Van de Kamp had wanted to reach for the stars when he officially announced 
his candidacy for governor of California. But as it turned out Sunday, he was 
forced to be more down to earth -- to aim right for the throat of his 
invigorated and freshly threatening Democratic primary opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, the measured man who is California's two-term attorney general, 
was uncharacteristically tough and scathing as he sought to present Democrats 
with a compelling contrast between himself and his flashier challenger, former 
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many times we march into the booth frustrated by a lack of real choice. 
Not this time. . . . It's time to talk candidly about the campaign that lies 
ahead," he told a rally of 325 supporters at Mission High School here in 
Feinstein's home town. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp listed the differences as he sees them: 
</P>
<P>
On insurance, Feinstein sided with insurance companies in the 1988 ballot 
proposition fight over insurance reforms. He did not. 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne Feinstein stood with the greediest special interest in the state -- the 
only prominent Democrat to put her name on the line for the insurance 
industry," said Van de Kamp, who sided with the lawyers in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
On the environment, he noted she does not support the so-called "Big Green" 
environmental ballot measure he is co-sponsoring with conservationists for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
On financial management, Van de Kamp said he has proposed specific taxes or 
bonds to pay for the programs he proposes. Feinstein mostly has ducked the 
how-will-you-pay-for-it issue. 
</P>
<P>
"She uses all the buzzwords. She'll re-prioritize; she'll consult the experts; 
she'll take money from one pocket and put it in another; she'll say anything 
but answer the question." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp noted that Feinstein left the mayor's office with a projected 
budget deficit of $180 million. "Dianne Feinstein's budget mismanagement turned 
the City by the Bay into the city that could not pay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That charge was supported by Feinstein's successor, Mayor Art Agnos. He told 
the rally: "No mayor knows better than I do why we need John Van de Kamp to be 
the next governor." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp also took a roundhouse swing at other aspects of her mayorality -- 
complaining that she awarded the key to the city to the late dictator Ferdinand 
E. Marcos of the Philippines, and that she, as mayor, was sued for failing to 
resolve civil rights hiring and harassment disputes in the city Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine a Democratic candidate who was sued by Ronald Reagan for failing to 
stand up for civil rights?" Van de Kamp scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
On government ethics, Van de Kamp noted he is sponsoring a bitterly 
controversial proposal to limit the terms of state officials. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Feinstein's pledge to release her tax returns and her failure to 
do so, he said: "You can't promise to lead a reformer's crusade for ethics and 
openness in government when you won't release you own tax returns for the years 
you've held public office." 
</P>
<P>
On abortion, Van de Kamp continued to warn that the so-called "speedy trial" 
ballot proposition that will appear on the June ballot with Feinstein's support 
unwittingly threatens abortion rights. Van de Kamp is circulating an initiative 
that aims to accomplish the same ends, but specifically states that abortion 
rights are not to be jeopardized in California. 
</P>
<P>
In this effort, he was supported by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae) in her 
warm-up speech to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
"As a women I am asked, there is a woman in this race, why am I supporting a 
man?" Boxer said. She answered: "I am supporting the best feminist in the race, 
absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important and difficult difference Van de Kamp sought to note 
was on the question of change. 
</P>
<P>
Which of the two candidates is really the agent of change at the start of the 
1990s? Is it Feinstein, the first woman to run seriously for governor, a 
one-time political maverick who has become a favorite of many insiders? Or is 
it Van de Kamp, the one-time Establishment favorite who has become an 
unexpected rebel? 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot change California if your goal is to get along with the status quo, 
go along with the status quo and be endorsed by the status quo," Van de Kamp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For politicians, these "official" declarations of candidacy are a significant 
ritual. They are a chance to frame a campaign, to put in words its reason and 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp is the last of three major gubernatorial contenders to undertake 
the rite. Feinstein was first, followed by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who is 
virtually assured of the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general's hope had been to undercut Feinstein and maybe drive her 
from the race by now. But the opposite has happened. In the last few weeks, she 
has shown her resolve to compete and, according to polls, has become the 
contender on the march. Van de Kamp has found himself laboring to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
For just that reason, Van de Kamp forswore the traditional city-to-city 
prop-stop announcement Sunday. Instead he spent the day in Feinstein's back 
yard. "Right in her face," as one aide said gamely. 
</P>
<P>
After the announcement rally, Van de Kamp took the afternoon off to spend time 
with his family. He returned to the high school briefly for a spaghetti feed 
with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Today and Tuesday, Van de Kamp will continue his announcement ritual with 
visits to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to striking out at Feinstein, Van de Kamp sought with his opening 
speech to cement his candidacy and his three ballot initiatives -- the 
environmental initiative, the ethics proposal and the anti-crime/pro-abortion 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it is an unproved strategy that has gobbled up a considerable share of 
Van de Kamp's time and resources just to gather the signatures to qualify the 
initiatives for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the campaign reported that 70% of the needed signatures had been 
collected for the environmental proposal, 60% for the crime measure and not 
quite 50% for the ethics proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The vote-for-me, vote-for-my-platform strategy originally was designed to carry 
Van de Kamp through the general election against Wilson. But with the 
unexpected strength of Feinstein, her mediagenic personality and personal 
wealth to assist her candidacy, the initiatives have now become Van de Kamp's 
hope for the upcoming primary. 
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine where we'd be without them," said one top strategist.

On a drizzly winter afternoon Dan Syrek stalks the edge of a city street, 
sloshing through mud puddles and dodging chuckholes, when he spots a piece of 
plastic sheeting beneath a bush. He clicks a hand counter to record the 
finding. 
</P>
<P>
A few feet away he spots a few shards of plaster. Click. A large sheet of 
cardboard. Click. Scattered pieces of wood. Click. 
</P>
<P>
To the uninitiated, the items being recorded are merely trash, the random 
detritus of a mobile society. But to litter expert Syrek, they represent a 
significant trend. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic sheeting, the cardboard and the plaster are categorized by Syrek as 
"accidental litter," items that he assumes flew off the beds of uncovered 
pickup trucks. So for the next 10 minutes, to confirm his litter hypothesis, he 
studies the traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
His hypothesis is confirmed. About 15% of all vehicles traveling on this 
particular street are uncovered pickup trucks -- an unusually high percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"Encourage more truck drivers around here to put covers on the backs of their 
trucks," Syrek says, "and you'll cut litter on this street significantly." 
</P>
<P>
Syrek, widely viewed as the nation's foremost authority on roadside litter, is 
the man that communities turn to when they have a litter problem. 
</P>
<P>
When highway officials in Texas wanted to reduce the state's roadside litter, 
they called Syrek. He spent months spying on Texas litterers and determined who 
was doing most of the littering (18- to 34-year-old men), and where (rural 
highways). The state then knew who to design their anti-litter campaign for and 
where to place the ads. 
</P>
<P>
In Hawaii, Syrek discovered that tourists did much of their littering at 
roadside spots with sweeping ocean views. The state placed trash cans at these 
spots and significantly cut litter. 
</P>
<P>
And in Washington state, he helped officials cut down on accidental litter by 
suggesting that public landfills charge owners of uncovered pickup trucks 
double the standard dumping fee. 
</P>
<P>
"Syrek's unique in his field -- he's the only full-time independent litter 
consultant around," said Don Clark, a director for the Texas State Highway 
Department. "When we were looking for someone to help us with our litter 
program, I asked around to other states and everyone gave Syrek high marks." 
</P>
<P>
Syrek has conducted litter studies in 17 states and three Canadian provinces. 
Based on his research, he has little good to say about his home state's 
litter-control efforts. He has determined that while California is the leader 
in many environmental areas, it is sadly deficient in its litter program. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go around the country doing work, I'm embarrassed to tell people I live 
in California," says Syrek. "We're got a real litter problem here." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of litter in California has gone up about 25% in the last decade, 
Syrek said, while state funding for cleaning up litter has dropped. With 
environmental issues such as global warming, oil spills and toxic chemicals 
dominating the news, the environmental community in California has neglected 
the growing litter problem, Syrek says. 
</P>
<P>
When asked why litter is so important, Syrek bristles. The man who has made 
litter his life's work holds out a forefinger and begins listing the ways 
litter plagues society. 
</P>
<P>
"Litter is expensive -- the cleanup bill in California is at least $100 million 
a year. Litter diverts resources -- people employed to clean up litter could be 
doing other important things. Litter affects property values -- nobody wants to 
live in a neighborhood filled with broken bottles and fast-food wrappers." 
</P>
<P>
After 17 years as a full-time litter consultant, Syrek still has not lost his 
enthusiasm for roadside refuse. He talks tirelessly, hour after hour, in a 
manner closer to a monologue than a conversation, about accidental litter, 
accumulated litter, fresh litter, visible litter and total litter. 
</P>
<P>
The office in his Sacramento home is filled with 300 computer disks containing 
litter data and dozens of folders jammed with litter charts, litter graphs and 
litter reports that he has written, such as "Summary of Recent Developments in 
Litter Control," and "Changes in Visible Litter since 1985." 
</P>
<P>
Syrek becomes irritated when litter is referred to as trash or garbage or junk. 
</P>
<P>
"Trash," he said, scowling, "is a very poor word. Trash is what's in a trash 
can. Garbage is related to food. Junk is something like an old car." 
</P>
<P>
Fixing a visitor with an intent stare, he declares somberly: "What is litter? 
Litter is solid waste in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
Syrek has dozens of arcane litter statistics at his disposal. During the course 
of a conversation, he said that 27% of all litter is from fast-food 
restaurants. Littering declines 50% in the rain. Seventy-five percent of all 
litterers are male. Animals tipping over trash cans represent 1.1% of the 
nation's total litter. 
</P>
<P>
Syrek's plethora of litter data enabled Texas highway officials to devise one 
of the nation's most successful litter programs. In the mid-1980s, Texas was 
spending $20 million a year cleaning up roadside litter, and the amount was 
increasing by $3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Syrek's data, Texas designed a campaign that reduced litter from 1985 
to 1989 by 60%, saving the state millions of dollars, said Clark, the Texas 
highway official. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, most anti-litter ads politely asked people not to litter, Syrek 
said, and featured cute little animals. But the typical litterer in Texas, 
Syrek determined, would not be influenced by this approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a guy named 'Bubba,' who drives a pickup truck, watches 
football all day and drinks a lot of beer . . . in short a total slob," Syrek 
said. ". . . If this guy sees a billboard with a cute little owl asking him not 
to litter, he'll throw a beer can at it." 
</P>
<P>
So Texas devised a macho advertising campaign with the menacing slogan, "Don't 
Mess With Texas." It featured professional football players such as Ed (Too 
Tall) Jones and gravel-voiced country-Western singers. The program was so 
successful that Oklahoma soon launched a similar campaign with another 
no-nonsense slogan: "Don't lay that trash on Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Syrek, who has an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering, was working 
for a research foundation near Sacramento in the early 1970s when he was named 
project manager of a litter survey. By the time the survey was completed, Syrek 
was so fascinated by the many facets of litter that he entered the field full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw at once that this was a field where no serious scientific research had 
ever been done . . . it was virgin territory," Syrek said, eyes shining. "And 
unlike most scientific fields, I didn't need any expensive laboratory 
equipment. With litter, you just go out on the street and count it." 
</P>
<P>
Now he earns about $50,000 a year as a litter consultant and has more work than 
he can handle. He has already agreed to conduct litter surveys this year in 
Louisiana, Florida, Minnesota and Alberta, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Syrek, small and intense, wears a yellow hard hat and orange fluorescent vest 
while conducting litter surveys. On a recent afternoon, as he was preparing for 
a litter count at an empty lot in North Sacramento, he turned to a visitor and 
said, "Don't say anything until I'm through counting. I've got to concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, he has been monitoring seven sites in Sacramento for litter trends. 
In addition to charting standard litter data, Syrek also feels he is on the 
cutting edge of societal behavior. He said he was among the first to know that 
condom use had risen sharply. He knows cigarette consumption is down because he 
finds fewer empty packs. And he knows all about the crack epidemic from the 
thousands of small plastic bags he finds in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
He is constantly amused by the love notes he finds during his litter patrols 
and he stores them all in a file folder. They range from the torrid -- an 
assignation note blown off a windshield -- to the ebullient -- "I'm so glad I 
met you, baby" -- and the poignant -- a letter from a boy to his girlfriend's 
mother, conveying his honorable intentions and his hope that the mother would 
no longer try to keep them apart. Syrek found the letter torn in half, 
unopened. 
</P>
<P>
"These little slices of life, these random samples of America make my work 
interesting," Syrek said. "Most scientists are stuck in their cubicles all day, 
but I enjoy being able to get out of the office for my research. And, you 
know," he said earnestly, "you can really learn a lot about a place through its 
litter."

STOCKS, YEN FALL SHARPLY IN TOKYO MARKETS; 
</P>
<P>
PLUNGE: THE 4.5% LOSS IN SECURITIES AND THE JAPANESE CURRENCY DROP PROMPTED 
FEARS THAT A "VICIOUS CYCLE" MIGHT BE STARTING.

<P>
The Tokyo stock market and the Japanese yen plunged today, prompting worries of 
a "vicious cycle" in the securities and foreign exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
The market closed at 33,321.87, down 1,569.10 points, or 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei index of 225 stocks had tumbled by 1,459.79 yen -- or 4.2% in 
value -- to 33,432.18 by the end of morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
Matters got worse in the afternoon as Tokyo share prices continued their rapid 
descent. The Nikkei index at 1:46 p.m. in Japan was down 2,047.34 points, or 
just over 6%, to 32,843.63. After the central bank of Japan started moving to 
prop up the yen, the index bounced back to 33,128.18 by 2:42 p.m. for a decline 
of more than 5% on the day. 
</P>
<P>
If maintained at that level, the decline would have been the second biggest 
ever in the Tokyo stock market, eclipsed only by the 3,836-point decline on 
Oct. 20, 1987, when markets worldwide were plummeting. A day earlier, the Dow 
Jones industrial average fell 508 points for its biggest decline ever. 
</P>
<P>
The yen, meanwhile, plummeted to 148.50 to the dollar, a drop of 2.03 points, 
or 1.4% below Friday's close. That is the lowest point for the yen in the past 
5 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the yen from falling even further, the Bank of Japan sold $1.3 billion 
of U.S. currency, according to market sources quoted by Reuters news agency. 
The Japanese central bank is concerned about keeping the dollar from rising 
above the 149 yen, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The troubles in the financial markets come amid mounting concerns over 
worsening trade friction between the United States and Japan, expectations of 
higher interest rates and uncertainty over the domestic political situation in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The potential impact on the American stock market is uncertain, analysts said. 
Although troubles in the Tokyo market last week caused major disruptions in 
European exchanges, the U.S. stock market was only modestly affected. 
</P>
<P>
Coming on top of two dramatic stock market declines last Wednesday and Friday, 
the precipitous fall today spurred Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to 
confess for the first time that he was "very worried." But he declared only 
that he was carefully watching developments on both the stock and the foreign 
exchange markets. 
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto insisted that the "fundamentals" of Japan's economy remain sound. But 
investors, he complained, are focusing on news reports of uncertainties in 
political developments in Japan, where the ruling party won a convincing 
victory in a lower house election Feb. 18, but lost control of the upper house 
in an election for that chamber last July. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he added, investors are worried about the outcome of U.S.-Japan 
negotiations on sensitive trade issues. Some analysts believe the two nations 
are on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu accepted a surprise invitation from 
President Bush to travel to Palm Springs on Friday and Saturday for an 
emergency bilateral summit that is expected to focus on the so-called 
Structural Impediments Initiative talks. 
</P>
<P>
American trade negotiators argue that structural barriers in the Japanese 
economic system are blocking a free flow of U.S. exports to Japan. Japanese 
negotiators argue that American trade problems are largely of the United 
States' own making, given its relatively low savings rate and high budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Mounting economic frictions have led to frequent criticism of Japan in the 
United States. In Japan, there is growing resentment of what are viewed as 
high-handed American demands. 
</P>
<P>
Also likely to be discussed in the meeting between Bush and Kaifu are threats 
of retaliation that the United States has made if Japan fails to open its 
markets to forestry products, communications satellites and supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese government officials said privately that a "vicious cycle" had set in 
which stock price declines depress the yen, and decreases in the yen's value 
drive down stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Stock authorities were reported to be planning to ease terms of credit allowed 
for stock purchases, and the Finance Ministry was purchasing government bonds 
to raise their prices and keep interest rates on other instruments from rising 
further. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of morning trading on the stock exchange, about 15% of orders to 
sell stock had not been matched up with orders to buy stock. Brokers confessed 
that they were unable to predict how far prices might fall.

CZECHS WILL DEFEND FREEDOM, HAVEL SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
President Vaclav Havel on Sunday addressed a cheering crowd in Prague's 
Wenceslas Square and vowed that Czechoslovakia will defend its new-found 
freedom after more than four decades of communism. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had freedom for a long time, but I assure you we are going to 
defend it this time," Havel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our weapon is that right and justice are on our side." 
</P>
<P>
During the rally, held to mark the 42nd anniversary of the Communist takeover 
of Czechoslovakia, Havel spoke from the same balcony where then-Prime Minister 
Klement Gottwald proclaimed the victory of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Said Havel: "A predecessor we cannot be too proud about announced that the 
overthrow had taken place. This is a happy opportunity to announce from the 
same place that we can say the truth without being punished." 
</P>
<P>
He said the state of the country after the ousting of the Communists late last 
year was very sad -- unbreathable air, undrinkable water, the land covered with 
"rabbit hutches" as houses. He said this will take years to change. 
</P>
<P>
Havel leaves today for Moscow, where he is scheduled to meet with Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
One of the issues will be the Soviet troop pullout from Czechoslovakia. Soviet 
and Czechoslovak negotiators agreed last Thursday on a total withdrawal, the 
first of which begins today with a tank division near the Polish border. It is 
apparently timed to coincide with Havel's trip. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout is due to be completed by 1991.

For Carla Gruodis, being Lithuanian once meant missing the Saturday morning 
cartoon shows on television. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toronto to parents who fled their native Lithuania as children near the 
end of World War II, Gruodis, now 25, spent her Saturday mornings learning the 
history of her ancestral home and the complex grammar of its language at a 
special Lithuanian Catholic Church school. 
</P>
<P>
She was not a willing student. "It was one of those things where they had to 
bribe us," she recalled with a smile. "You know: 'We'll take you to McDonald's 
afterwards.' " 
</P>
<P>
But now the payoff has arrived for Gruodis and several other young, North 
American-Lithuanians like her who are putting their language and other skills 
to work here in service of Lithuania's dramatic drive to restore its 
independence from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like this don't happen back in Canada," explained Darius Cuplinskas, 
24, who, along with Gruodis and Chicago-born Edward Tuskenis, edits the 
Lithuanian Review. The Review is a new English-language newspaper published in 
the Soviet republic of Lithuania for emigrant Lithuanians, Soviet scholars, 
journalists and diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance to play a role in history instead of just interpreting it or 
commenting on it," added Cuplinskas, who majored in history and literary 
studies at the University of Toronto before coming to Lithuania last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Reformers throughout Eastern Europe during this last, remarkable year of 
transformation have looked to the West and particularly to their respective 
emigrant communities for support. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, those either expelled or hounded out of the country after 
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion began coming back in the first days of Prague's 
"velvet revolution" last November and December. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet Union, the reform programs of perestroika (restructuring) and 
glasnost (openness) have found supporters among such former outcasts and 
cultural giants as Mstislav Rostropovich. 
</P>
<P>
But the response here is unusual in several respects. These young people are 
patriots of a nation they knew only secondhand. Some had never even visited 
Lithuania until now. And even though only in their 20s, they have quickly 
achieved positions of real influence. 
</P>
<P>
Chicagoan Rita Dapkus, 28, has just taken over as director of the Sajudis Press 
Agency, the news and information service of Lithuania's two-year-old mass 
reform movement of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
Aidas Palubinskas, 20, a native of Lakewood, Calif., is active in Lithuania's 
recently revived Christian Democratic political party. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that these North American-Lithuanians have decided to devote at least 
a substantial period of their young lives to their ancestral homeland is most 
of all testimony to the strong sense of cultural identity among so many 
Lithuanian emigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
In that, they are more like the young Western Jews who emigrate to Israel than 
others who are going back to the fledgling new democracies of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents raised me to understand that, not only do I have to work for 
Lithuania's independence in the States, but also, when it becomes independent, 
I have to go back not only to live, but to help rebuild," Palubinskas said. 
</P>
<P>
These young people spoke Lithuanian in their homes. They may have picked up 
some English in the streets, but some spoke virtually none at all until they 
were in kindergarten. They recall their young lives as centered around their 
respective emigrant community's church, with its grammar lessons, Scout troops, 
summer camps and folk dance groups. 
</P>
<P>
Some got involved in politics very young. Cuplinskas, for example, was 
president of the Amnesty International chapter at his university, and active 
enough in the cause that he was twice denied visas to visit Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
Gruodis described herself as from "a kind of lefty student journalism 
background," which sharpened her interest in the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania, they mostly throw themselves into the cause, try to ignore the 
hardships of everyday life and try not spend too much time worrying about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
They came here mostly on student visas, although their "classrooms" turned out 
to be mostly the cluttered offices and smoke-filled rooms where amateur 
Lithuanian politicians are trying to become professional. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how she viewed her role, Dapkus looked slightly taken aback. "To tell you 
the truth, I don't think about it," she said between phone calls to her shared, 
fourth-floor office at Sajudis headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess nuns kind of devote themselves to religion, and I devote myself to 
this," Dapkus added. "It's almost as if I don't exist as an individual." 
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper is perfect for the kind of thing we want to do -- to use our 
skills to assist the process here," commented Gruodis, who is listed on the 
masthead as editor in chief of the Lithuanian Review. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all very devoted to helping the revolution, but on the other hand it's 
incredibly interesting work for us. . . . I'm probably making some of the most 
important contacts and friendships of my life right now." 
</P>
<P>
Gruodis said she feels "more at home here than I felt in Canada. I just know I 
want to be here. I really like it." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, she notes that if it all goes wrong somehow -- if 
Moscow cracks down -- the native Lithuanians have far more to lose than she 
does. It would be hard, she said, but she could return to life in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Others want to go back to North America, at least to continue their education, 
or perhaps to split their time between their two "homes." 
</P>
<P>
Palubinskas said he wants to finish his undergraduate work at Chicago's Loyola 
University, and then go on to a master's and a doctorate in international 
relations. "I'd like to be a diplomat -- or the foreign minister of Lithuania," 
he said.

HONECKER CHARGED WITH DIVERTING MILLIONS IN RANSOM TO HIS ACCOUNT

<P>
The East German prosecutor's office said Sunday that former East German leader 
Erich Honecker has been charged with diverting to his own bank account millions 
of West German marks paid to his government to ransom political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph told the official East German 
news service ADN that the 77-year-old former president and Communist Party 
leader has been accused among other things of paying into his East Berlin bank 
account $45 million in West German marks in 1989 alone. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman confirmed a report published in the current edition of Der 
Spiegel, the weekly West German news magazine, that the huge sum was paid by 
the West German government to "buy" freedom for dissident East Germans and was 
paid into an account to which only Honecker had access. 
</P>

The prosecutor's office told ADN that Honecker, who was ousted in October, 
still is being investigated and no date has been set for a trial on the many

The Pakistan government rejected U.S. charges of human rights abuses and called 
a State Department report an attempt to malign the people of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government called the annual report on human 
rights "a classical example of disinformation." 
</P>
<P>
The report, released last week, said Pakistan police commonly torture people in 
custody. It also said that religious minorities face discrimination and that 
television and radio suppress news.

NICOSIA, Cyprus 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Within the 16th-Century Venetian walls of Nicosia's Old City, the division of 
Cyprus is traced by rusting strands of barbed wire, vacant, booby-trapped shops 
and two-man U.N. foot patrols. 
</P>
<P>
The buffer zone separating Greek Cypriots from Turkish Cypriots is little more 
than 10 yards wide at some points. It is uncomfortably quiet here. On both 
sides, behind dirt bunkers and oil-drum barricades, guards armed with West 
German G-3 rifles watch for movement. 
</P>
<P>
"You point that camera at them, and they'll point a rifle at you," warned Capt. 
Chris Hand of the Canadian U.N. contingent. 
</P>
<P>
The antagonisms of this divided island in the eastern Mediterranean have 
resisted reconciliation for decades, but today, another attempt to break the 
stalemate will be made. At U.N. headquarters in New York, under the auspices of 
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, the leaders of the two communities 
will meet for the first time since June. 
</P>
<P>
George Vassiliou, president of the Republic of Cyprus, and Rauf Denktash, 
president of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, have given no 
indication that they have any new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"There are difficulties, and we cannot foretell the outcome of this effort," 
Vassiliou said recently. "But if we go to New York overstressing the 
difficulties, the danger of non-success becomes even greater. . . . The degree 
of progress will depend on the attitude of the other side." 
</P>
<P>
The attitude of Denktash, whose unilaterally proclaimed state is recognized 
only by Turkey, has been marked by open reluctance to go to New York at all. 
Turkish Cypriot sources suggest that it will be a short visit. 
</P>
<P>
Both men cling to long-held formulas for reconciliation. Relations between 
Greek and Turkish Cypriots were shaken in the years after independence from 
Britain in 1960, and shattered in 1974 when a coup engineered by a military 
regime in Greece opened the door for a Turkish invasion of the island. 
</P>
<P>
After two weeks, the fighting was stopped along a line that roughly coincides 
with the Green Line that now divides the island, 110 miles from Morphu Bay on 
the northwest coast to the port city of Famagusta in the east. 
</P>
<P>
Within months, an estimated 200,000 Greek Cypriots who lived in the north and 
70,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south had fled or were driven across the Green 
Line into the protective arms of their ethnic brethren. Today, fewer than 1,000 
live outside their communal boundaries. Cyprus and the Cypriots are effectively 
divided. 
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting will be the latest in a long series of reconciliation talks. 
Vassiliou, elected in 1988 on a pledge to deal with what diplomats call "the 
Cyprus problem," has stepped up the contacts, meeting for more than 100 hours 
with Denktash, usually at the offices of the U.N. representative here. 
</P>
<P>
Vassiliou, a businessman who wants to keep talking to the Turkish Cypriots, 
nevertheless endorses a longstanding Greek Cypriot demand for political 
reconciliation, the "three freedoms" -- freedom of movement, freedom of 
settlement and freedom to buy property. 
</P>
<P>
This fundamental demand marks Denktash's greatest concern -- that the ethnic 
Greeks, who make up more than 80% of the island's population, will overwhelm 
the Turkish Cypriot community. 
</P>
<P>
Denktash, a lawyer, prefers a political arrangement that would continue the 
present reality, a Turkish Cypriot community living apart with its own culture 
and religion, Muslim, as opposed to the Christian Greek Cypriots. 
</P>
<P>
And he demands "political equality" in representation. 
</P>
<P>
Both men have put forth proposals for a federation, but Denktash wants it 
"bizonal," and he wants the Turkish troops to remain in the north to ensure it. 
Vassiliou, on the other hand, supports a federation with a strong central 
government, representation based largely on population, the "three freedoms" 
and withdrawal of the Turkish forces. 
</P>
<P>
Bridging the gap would require not only some sort of compromise formula, but 
overcoming heartfelt emotional issues. There are, for instance, more than 1,600 
Greek Cypriots still listed as missing in the fighting of 1974. Their relatives 
demand an accounting. 
</P>
<P>
Less often raised is the fate of 700 reportedly missing Turkish Cypriots. Both 
sides remember bitterly the intercommunal atrocities committed in the turbulent 
1960s. More recently, the emigration of an estimated 45,000 to 60,000 Turkish 
settlers from the mainland have colored attitudes on both sides of the line. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar is expected to suggest some ice-breaking steps -- goodwill 
gestures -- while discussions continue on the formidable problem of some new 
form of government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Settled by the Greeks in antiquity, conquered by Turkey in 1571 and taken over 
by Britain in 1914, Cyprus is the largest island in the eastern Mediterranean. 
It supports diverse and often antagonistic races and traditions. More than 75% 
of the population speaks Greek and belongs to the Orthodox Church, while more 
than 20% is Turkish-speaking Muslim. In July, 1974, Greek Cypriot extremists, 
in collusion with the military junta then ruling Greece, overthrew President 
Makarios and established a rightist government dedicated to enosis, or union 
with Greece. Five days later, Turkish forces landed in northern Cyprus.

Britain's opposition Labor Party has a 17-point lead over the ruling 
Conservatives, its highest ranking in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decade 
in power, a poll found. Thatcher's political fortunes have been declining amid 
economic stagnation and Britain's isolated stance in international forums on 
issues such as South Africa and European union. The survey gave Labor 51%, the 
Conservatives 34%, the centrist Liberal Democrats 5% and other parties 10%.

Weeds, trash and brambles have overrun the more than 200 black graves. For more

STORM THAT LEFT 23 DEAD DUMPS SNOW IN EAST, CLOSING HIGHWAYS

<P>
Heavy snow and frigid temperatures moved to the East Coast on Sunday after 
leaving 23 dead on Great Lakes highways and forcing sports fans in two states 
to sleep over in arenas rather than risk treacherous drives home. 
</P>
<P>
The quick-moving storm dumped between 2 inches and 5 inches of snow in northern 
New Jersey and New York. 
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility in blowing snow forced police to close a 16-mile stretch of the 
New York State Thruway in the Hudson Valley. 
</P>
<P>
New Englanders awoke to a storm expected to drop up to a foot of snow on the 
region. A winter storm warning was in effect for most of southern New England, 
two days after the region recorded balmy 65-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Falling snow and wind chills to 40 degrees below zero Sunday prompted officials 
to urge caution for motorists in western Pennsylvania and the West Virginia 
panhandle. At least 6 inches of snow was recorded at the airport in West 
Virginia on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said arctic air spilling down from Canada created 
bone-chilling temperatures throughout the East Coast and Midwest, where the 
mercury hovered in the single digits and teens. The temperatures were expected 
to dip to near-record lows overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Highway crews removed hundreds of wrecked cars that littered roadways in Ohio, 
Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin. Saturday's blowing snow and 60 m.p.h. winds 
were blamed for 23 traffic fatalities in the four states, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Roads remained ice-covered in parts of lower Michigan, which was battered 
Sunday by 40 m.p.h. winds and up to 10 inches of snow Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people were forced to spend the night at the Oak Harbor High School 
near Toledo, Ohio, after a sectional wrestling tournament was canceled because 
blowing snow forced the closure of roads in the area, police said. Shelters 
were set up in Bowling Green fire departments and an Elks Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
In Indianapolis, more than 600 people who had come to see the Indiana girls' 
high school basketball championships spent Saturday night in their seats.

ATLANTIS COUNTDOWN PUT ON HOLD AS WINDS THREATEN LAUNCH 
</P>

KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration counted down toward a fifth 
attempt to launch the space shuttle Atlantis early this morning, as clouds and 
high, gusting winds threatened to delay the launch a fifth time. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be nip and tuck," said Air Force Capt. Tom Strange, the shuttle 
weather officer. "We have to hope for a letup, but at this point we don't see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
As the planned launch time of 12:55 a.m. EST approached, launch director Bob 
Sieck called for an extended hold. 
</P>
<P>
Winds over Kennedy Space Center reached 33 m.p.h. in the opening hour of the 
planned launch period, which began at midnight Sunday and was to extend through 
4 a.m. Unless the winds calmed as the launch period wore on, the shuttle could 
be grounded for the fifth time. NASA rules do not permit a launch unless wind 
conditions safely permit the shuttle to lift off its pad and to return and land 
at the space center if such an emergency measure were to become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth attempt to launch the craft came after an astronaut's cold, then foul 
weather, and finally a last-minute computer failure delayed the launch of the 
space shuttle four separate times. 
</P>
<P>
Working throughout Sunday morning and afternoon, NASA engineers fixed the 
"Cyber B," a back-up computer designed to ensure the safety of areas beneath 
the flight path. Sunday morning's delay cost taxpayers $547,000 in labor and 
material expenses at Kennedy Space Center alone, since the shuttle was forced 
to jettison 500,000 gallons of fuel at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
The three earlier delays, which were called hours before countdowns were to 
have begun, cost $247,000 in added services. 
</P>
<P>
The flight of Atlantis, the 34th flight of a U.S. space shuttle and the sixth 
shuttle flight entirely dedicated to a Defense Department mission, has a crew 
of five military astronauts. John O. Creighton, a Navy captain, is commanding 
the flight. Creighton's scratchy throat and congestion prompted NASA to call 
off two earlier launch attempts. The other astronauts aboard Atlantis are Air 
Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. 
David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre 
J. Thuot. 
</P>
<P>
While the Defense Department has shrouded Atlantis' payload in secrecy, experts 
said that the shuttle is being used to carry a $500-million satellite called 
the KH-12 into space. The "keyhole" satellite would be the sixth in a 
constellation of U.S. craft designed to photograph and relay images of military 
and other installations, according to John Pike, a space expert with the 
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.

HIKER FALLS TO DEATH AS HUMAN CHAIN BREAKS 
</P>

<P>
A hiker plummeted 125 feet to his death after losing his grip on a "human 
chain" that was attempting to rescue him from a steep cliff in the Angeles 
National Forest, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Anthony Grijalva, 22, of Los Angeles was killed Saturday afternoon while 
climbing up a cliff next to Switzer Falls in the San Gabriel Mountains, north 
of La Canada Flintridge, Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Grijalva had already fallen once into a shallow pond at the foot of the cliff 
and was trying to rejoin friends at the top of the falls when he fell a second 
time, Sheriff's Sgt. Greg McHenry said. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses said Grijalva fell at least 70 feet the first time, but was 
apparently unhurt and started scaling the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was OK and he was going to come back up, and then we saw him 
climbing . . . straight up," said Mark Grabfelder, 19, of Glendale, who was 
with three friends in another hiking group. 
</P>
<P>
When Grijalva became stuck near the top, he called for help. 
</P>
<P>
"He was gripping the dirt. He said, 'Please help me,' " said John Lambert of 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Grabfelder said he and another friend formed a human chain. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought he might pull us over with him, but I sat down and gave him my leg 
so he could pull himself up," Grabfelder said. "He grabbed my shoe, but then he 
started to slip. I heard him scream and we watched him fall. . . . I was almost 
too scared to climb across the rocks to go back to the car." 
</P>
<P>
Grijalva was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said the cliff is mostly 
decomposed granite, which looks stable but gives way easily.

STREET SMART: CAR TROUBLE ON THE FREEWAY? STAY OUT OF THE MEDIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I was wondering why there are no call boxes in the median of the freeways. I 
see an awful lot of people stuck there. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Williams 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
Aside from certain spots in East Beirut, the median strip on a Southern 
California freeway is the most dangerous spot to be with a broken-down car. On 
most Orange County freeways, there's hardly room for a bicycle to park, let 
alone an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, the California Department of Transportation has avoided 
putting call boxes along the median strip, where they would be magnets for 
motorists in trouble, said Albert Miranda, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda said officials encourage motorists with flat tires, engine problems or 
other malfunctions to pull off to the nearest freeway exit or over to the 
shoulder, where they generally have a better chance of staying out of harm's 
way. 
</P>
<P>
That's not always possible, of course. If the freeway is jam-packed when your 
Buick starts belching black smoke, you may have no choice but to stop in the 
median. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is avoid heart failure. Tell life to go pass in front of 
someone else's eyes, then take steps to save your own hide. Miranda recommends 
taking a tip from Caltrans road crews: Get to the front of the car so you can 
use the vehicle as a shield from oncoming traffic; keep your eyes fixed on the 
cars barreling toward you. 
</P>
<P>
Those tactics are also recommended for folks forced to stop on a freeway 
shoulder. Most of our local freeways, unlike members of the Los Angeles Rams, 
don't have broad shoulders. In fact, some aren't much wider than a median 
strip. The pressure to handle heavy traffic flow has resulted in crowding more 
lanes onto a freeway right-of-way that rarely gets bigger. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
In the Feb. 5 edition, you had a letter from a woman who had a battered license 
plate that she wanted to have replaced but who had been told by the Department 
of Motor Vehicles that new plates for existing numbers are not issued. All she 
could do, they said, was get a new license number. 
</P>
<P>
But she has another option -- getting the plate restored. She could try 
Darryl's Plates, 4505 8th Ave. South, No. A-10, St. Petersburg, Fla., 33711. He 
does a masterful job of restoring a plate for less than $25, including return 
shipping. 
</P>
<P>
I just had one of those old black and gold California plates done by him, and 
it came back better than new. 
</P>
<P>
As for the state requirement that plates be on both front and rear bumpers: A 
front license plate is ugly on a nice car. It's a waste of taxpayers' money 
besides. 
</P>
<P>
Police will stop you if you have no front plate. I know. (I think they actually 
want to see one's car close up if it is at all antique, modified or otherwise 
out of the ordinary.) 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bernheimer 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
An interesting tip. There's a whole cottage industry of folks who specialize in 
license plate repair and resale. Some people have made a business of salvaging 
the old black California plates from junkyards, then restoring and reselling 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Using such restored plates is legal, according to Gina McGuiness, a spokeswoman 
for the state Department of Motor Vehicles in Sacramento. The job must be done 
properly, though. The plate cannot be cut down in size, and the original colors 
must be used. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
I'm a police officer with the UC Irvine police department. In your article 
about minors in pickup truck beds (Feb. 19), you said that people under age 18 
could not ride in a pickup bed. 
</P>
<P>
I thought you might like to know that actually that's not quite correct. The 
California Vehicle Code states that no one shall transport a minor under the 
age of 12 in the back of a truck unless it is enclosed to a height of 46 
inches. The code also says that if the children are secured so as to prevent 
their being thrown, that makes it OK. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Roberts 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for straightening that out. Street Smart's answers are only as good as 
the information we get from officials with the California Highway Patrol, local 
police departments, Caltrans and other agencies. In this case, a lieutenant at 
the Highway Patrol's Santa Ana office supplied incorrect information about the 
age limit for riders in pickup beds. Perhaps he'll start doing a better job of 
reading his vehicle code handbook. And so will we.

OFFENDER AND VICTIM RECONCILIATION SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE COUNTY'S PROGRAM BRINGS JUVENILES AND THEIR VICTIMS FACE TO FACE FOR 
A MEETING THAT CAN HELP BOTH.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kim Ficzko sat next to a 15-year-old Orange boy and carefully told him the 
trouble she went through in September when he and others broke into her car, 
which was parked at her Anaheim apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really brutal," she told him. "I felt angry and mad. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Who gave them the right to break into my car?' " 
</P>
<P>
This face-to-face meeting, Ficzko said, gave her the chance to calm her fears 
about the incident and restore some control in her life. 
</P>
<P>
For most victims, contact with an offender ends when a crime is committed, and 
they are otherwise removed from the court process. But with a new program in 
the county, juvenile offenders meet their victims to try to explain the 
situation and agree on some sort of restitution. 
</P>
<P>
The program, the first of its kind in Orange County, also gives offenders the 
chance to right their wrongs and see who it is they are harming, all outside 
the confines of a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
The court system is "sort of a detached process from the crime that occurred," 
said Bonnie Glende, the boy's probation officer. "This gives a sense that this 
was a person, that this person was hurt. It gets them out of the legalese and 
onto a more personal level." 
</P>
<P>
The Victim Offender Reconciliation Program, as it is called, received approval 
from the county's Juvenile Probation Department in August. Since then, about a 
dozen juveniles have met their victims in sessions mediated by a community 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
The Probation Department refers juveniles to the St. Vincent de Paul Center, a 
private, Catholic organization in Orange that operates the program. A mediator 
talks with the victim and the offender separately and explains the program. If 
both agree, a meeting is arranged. 
</P>
<P>
"It really reframes our justice system," said Mike Niemeyer, the coordinator of 
the program and the Catholic chaplain to Orange County Juvenile Hall. "It 
allows us to look through different lenses." 
</P>
<P>
Niemeyer said that in the current system, juveniles pay the state rather than 
the victim, either by serving detention, probation or doing community service 
work. 
</P>
<P>
With this program, he said, "what we're dealing with is not broken laws but 
broken relationships. What we're dealing with is the needs of the people 
involved. It's a sense of the community having some ownership in the justice 
process." 
</P>
<P>
After she explained her troubles at their first meeting, Ficzko and the boy 
agreed on the restitution. Ficzko, 37, lost a day's wages while the car was 
being repaired, so the boy agreed to pay her $20 each month for six months, 
making up a day's wages. The first payment came on Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty dollars isn't much, but it's worth the effort that he did," Ficzko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, such as those involving physical acts of violence, offenders 
might agree to pay medical bills or to change their behavior. Such agreements 
give victims more of a voice in the outcome of a case, Niemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"When a crime occurs, the victim loses a sense of control over their lives," 
Niemeyer said. "There's a loss of a sense of security. This is an opportunity 
for them to regain control in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
But not every victim has been anxious to have a word with an offender. So far, 
about 40% of the victims they asked to participate have refused. Even Ficzko 
had her doubts and needed some convincing. 
</P>
<P>
"I said if he looked mean to me I would leave," she said. "If he looked nice, I 
would talk." 
</P>
<P>
But the meetings can be just as scary for the offender. Niemeyer said he knows 
of one boy who was happy to get a court sentence in Juvenile Hall rather than 
have to meet with the victim. 
</P>
<P>
But for the boy in Ficzko's case, the meeting was a chance to explain how it 
all happened. He said that this was his first offense and that he had become 
involved with the wrong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"They were bad guys," he said. "They got in trouble before." 
</P>
<P>
Had he not been able to meet the victim and just go through regular court 
channels, he said, "it would be harder. There wouldn't be anyone to talk to. I 
got to explain to her what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It really helped me out," the boy said. "I think it's a lot easier to 
understand things." 
</P>
<P>
But the program has limitations. So far, the Probation Department has referred, 
for the most part, offenders convicted of less serious crimes such as auto 
burglary and vandalism. More serious crimes, such as rapes, shootings and 
stabbings, might require more expert mediators, probation officer Glende said. 
She also doubted that the program would help anyone who didn't admit to the 
crime or feel remorse. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Binder, a professor of psychology at UC Irvine, said the program 
probably would have limited success in the long run because in most cases, 
victims cannot overcome their animosity toward the juveniles. "It's not 
something I'd be optimistic about," he said. "Come back in five years and, I 
bet, it would be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Binder has helped create several county programs to help juvenile offenders, 
including one that arranges restitution for victims. But meetings between 
victims and criminals are rare and seldom desired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But a program in Fresno, which started seven years ago, has grown to include 60 
trained mediators who handle more than 500 cases a year. The Orange County 
program has about 15 volunteer mediators. 
</P>
<P>
The program has expanded so quickly, "we're getting way too many referrals," 
said Elaine Enns, a member of the Fresno program's management staff. She said 
about 70% of victims offered a meeting ultimately agree. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the victim-offender programs in the country are designed for juveniles. 
That might be because victims are more apt to hope that juveniles can be 
rehabilitated, Niemeyer said, although he believes that it could work just as 
well with adults. 
</P>
<P>
Ficzko said she ultimately agreed to the meeting when she heard the age of the 
offender. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a son, too," she said. "My son is 10 years old, and I don't want him to 
do that when he grows up. But if he did, I would want a program like this for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
As she left the room, Ficzko shook hands with the boy. Then she looked at him 
and said: "Good luck."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
NEWPORT TO HOUSE LAGUNA PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In what police say is an unusual arrangement that will allow Laguna Beach 
officers to stay closer to home while their station at City Hall is being 
remodeled, people arrested in Laguna Beach during the next year will be housed 
in Newport Beach Jail. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Newport Beach City 
Council, means Laguna police will not be pulled off their beats to drive 
prisoners to Orange County Jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, which will cost Laguna Beach $65 a day for each prisoner, will 
likely add two inmates a day to Newport Beach Jail, Laguna Beach Police Chief 
Neil Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the transportation of prisoners to a minimum, Purcell said, Laguna 
Beach will begin a "very vigorous cite and release program" which will involve 
releasing prisoners when possible rather than jailing them. For example, a 
drunk driver would probably be released to a friend who could safely drive him 
or her home instead of being jailed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Juveniles will be released to parents or guardians when possible or be taken to 
Juvenile Hall in the event of a serious crime, Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just do not have any choice right now," Purcell said. "The ones we send to 
Newport are the ones where we have no other choice than to incarcerate them." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tim Newman, spokesman for the Newport Beach Police Department, said the new 
procedure will not pose a hardship for Newport, which has 29 bunks for male 
prisoners who are held until bail is posted or until their arraignment date. 
Newport shares resources such as dogs and helicopters with other cities, he 
said, and sharing jail cells is just another way for cities to work together. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just kind of the spirit of cooperation, the right thing to do," Newman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Jail, which has a detox cell and eight bunks, is considered a 
24-hour temporary holding facility, he said. Two other cells with four bunks 
each were abandoned to make room for property and evidence because of crowded 
conditions in the department, Purcell said. The remodeling will not provide 
more jail cells but will improve conditions, he said. LESLIE EARNEST

YOUNGSTERS TO REDESIGN THE COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
Like the players of "Balance of Power," a global-conflict resolution game 
popular in high schools and colleges, 780 students at Rancho San Joaquin Middle 
School this week will plot strategy for a battle on Orange County turf. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of attempting to spare the planet from another world war, the 
students' goal will be to save Orange County from clogged roads and 
unbreathable air. 
</P>
<P>
How? By designing a balanced, growing community. 
</P>
<P>
In all of the school's 25 history-social science classes, groups of about six 
students each will pretend to be land developers, environmentalists, county 
government officials, transportation agencies or community activists 
dissatisfied with the county and interested in forming new cities. 
</P>
<P>
Each group will use county maps, minus real-life entities such as the Santa Ana 
Freeway and the county's 29 cities, for example, to perform various tasks, such 
as planning freeway routes, transit lines, bike trails, housing areas, business 
parks and even airports. 
</P>
<P>
And at the end of the weeklong program, on Friday, each group will share its 
results with an entire class. 
</P>
<P>
With public opinion surveys showing that traffic congestion is Orange County's 
biggest problem, county transportation officials hope that the pilot project at 
the Rancho San Joaquin campus will eventually be used elsewhere to educate 
future commuters -- and taxpayers -- about the complex public policy questions 
to be answered in trying to protect the quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of Melanie Lane, a former intern-turned-community-relations-aide 
for the Orange County Transportation Commission, the school program is called 
"Transportation Into the '90s and Beyond." 
</P>
<P>
"We should end up with 20 designs on how Orange County should have been 
planned, or may be planned in the future," Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong Orange County program is sponsored by representatives from each of 
the county's transportation agencies and Partners in Education, a volunteer, 
business-supported group. The intent of the program is to get students thinking 
beyond the problem of jammed freeways, Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids already know about traffic," Lane said. "They are less aware of its 
effect on our economy, on land-use and air pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Activities scheduled this week include participating in a community planning 
exercise, attending transportation exhibits and role-playing games. Some prizes 
will be awarded, including one for the student who correctly guesses how many 
people pass through Irvine on the San Diego Freeway each day. 
</P>
<P>
"Each group represents a special interest, and many of each group's plans may 
conflict with the plans of another group," states the written introduction to 
the game. "(But) each group member does have one thing in common. Everyone 
lives in Orange County and wants to make it a well-balanced community and a 
pleasant place to live." JEFFREY A. PERLMAN

CITY GIVES $18,000 TO FESTIVAL OF CULTURES

<TEXT>
<P>
The city has set aside $18,000 for its first Festival of Cultures, to be held 
June 2. 
</P>
<P>
The event would be similar to Placentia's Heritage Days, said James Soto, the 
city's director of recreation and human services. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping it will be so successful it will become a yearly event," Soto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The festival will include entertainment, food, craft and game booths 
representing various ethnic cultures. A portable stage will feature cultural 
music and dances, and the city will display the equipment used for street 
maintenance and emergency response efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Food and craft booths will be on Santa Fe Avenue, with priority space given to 
nonprofit clubs and organizations. 
</P>
<P>
A beer garden, to be located on Main Street south of the Santa Fe intersection, 
also is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Several local clubs and organizations will be invited to operate the 
concession, and a lottery system will be used to select the beer vendor. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to pay for the festival with revenues from renting food and 
game booths to vendors, but city staff asked for up to $18,000 to cover 
expenses if the number of vendors is smaller than expected, Soto said. JULIE

SHOOTING DEATH TIED TO JEALOUSY

<TEXT>
<P>
Olivia Bohaman's fatal mistake, according to friends, was to fall in love. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old hospital worker, shot to death Saturday in a dispute with her 
stepfather, had been dating a neighborhood man for about six months and was 
preparing to move in with him in one month, the friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Her stepfather, Jose Lopez Perez, 32, was reportedly so jealous of the 
association between Bohaman and her boyfriend that Saturday afternoon he 
allegedly confronted her with a gun and shot both her and her 15-year-old 
sister, Eileen, outside their apartment on the 4400 block of West Tampion 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He also allegedly fired half a dozen rounds at two girls standing nearby but 
failed to hit either of them. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very possessive," said Santos Ruiz, a neighbor and family friend. 
</P>
<P>
Olivia Bohaman, shot three times including once in the head, died at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange a short time after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, shot in the back, arm and shoulder, was released from the same 
hospital Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bohaman sisters' mother, who was not identified by name, was reportedly at 
her housecleaning job at the time of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police have recovered a car Perez was driving but on Sunday were 
still searching for him in connection with the shooting. Sgt. Bob Clark said 
Perez was probably en route to Mexico, where he grew up and has relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said several detectives have been assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jo Anne Ruiz, 24, a longtime friend of the Bohaman sisters, the 
shooting climaxed weeks of argument between Perez and his eldest stepdaughter 
over her relationship with a young man who lives around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Ruiz said, Perez drove by the man's apartment, fired a shot in 
the air and shouted for him to stay away from his stepdaughter. The next day, 
Ruiz said, Perez threatened to kill Olivia Bohaman's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
According to Noemi Lara, 14, a friend of Olivia Bohaman who was with Olivia and 
her sister at the time, Eileen Bohaman ran home to call police. 
</P>
<P>
Lara said she and Olivia followed, along with Lara's 8-year-old sister, Sandy. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as they all reached the Bohamans' two-story residence, Lara said Perez 
drove up and shouted at Eileen, who was standing outside, to call her sister 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled an automatic pistol out of his pants and just shot at Olivia," Lara 
said. "Then he turned and I heard four shots toward Eileen. I got my sister 
then and ran to the back of a camper" parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was running, I saw him point the gun at me. He fired three times. He 
went to his car then, and as he walked he kept shooting at me and my sister, 
yelling 'I'm going to get you.' When he got in his car, he was still shouting."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;

<P>
PRINCIPAL CREDITED FOR STATE HONOR

<P>
After a survey disclosed that one-third of the students at Gilbert Elementary 
School didn't eat before coming to school, Principal George Cottrell started a 
breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
When the homework scores of children whose families didn't speak English as a 
primary language started to decline, Cottrell started a parent education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage children to read more, he began a program to reward students for 
the number of minutes they spend each day with a book. 
</P>
<P>
For these efforts and others, the state Department of Education named Gilbert 
one of 10 "exemplary schools" in California this year. Gilbert was honored as a 
California Distinguished School last year. And school officials say the awards 
are due mostly to Cottrell's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell became the school's principal seven years ago and has presided over 
major changes at Gilbert. Once part of a middle-class neighborhood, Gilbert is 
now considered to be on the wrong side of the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the city's gangs live and feud nearby, and apartment complexes have 
gradually replaced single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The school's population has increased by more than half, from 450 to 737 
students. The number of minority students has also skyrocketed, as has the 
number of children from single-parent households. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his office, where most of one wall is taken up by rows of snapshots 
of children who attend Gilbert, Cottrell explained why he believes that the 
school has been so successful. 
</P>
<P>
"All children can learn," he said. "You've just got to get someone who cares." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Cottrell has gone out of his way to hire enthusiastic teachers and 
keep tabs on what goes on in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
He visits each classroom at least once a week, and frequently reviews teachers' 
lesson plans before they are presented. 
</P>
<P>
He is a popular figure on campus, drawing a crowd of second- and third-graders 
when he wanders across the playground during morning recess. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is great," said second-grader Isaac Aflaro. "I am always getting 
into trouble, but he always gives me a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell, 43, joined the Buena Park School District after earning a degree in 
speech pathology from Cal State Fullerton in 1969. He was first a special 
education teacher and was vice principal of Beatty School before joining 
Gilbert in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The first problem he tackled at Gilbert was low attendance at the annual 
Christmas program performed by the students. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell kept after parents to attend, and Gilbert now has to hold several 
performances of the program to accommodate all the interested parents. 
</P>
<P>
He also reached out to parents two years ago after the movie "Colors" was 
released. A group of third-graders wearing red got into a fight with another 
group wearing blue. 
</P>
<P>
He called an emergency parent meeting and the problem hasn't occurred since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell also does public relations work in the business community, urging 
local merchants to adopt the school and donate supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my job to make the budget sing," he said. "If you need something, there 
is always a way to get it." LYNDA NATALI

Q&amp;A: RICHARD L. HALL;

<P>
NEW BIA CHIEF TALKS QUALITY, COALITIONS, CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Michael Flagg, Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard L. Hall, 65, has been building houses since 1957. In those 33 years, 
building in California has become a lot more complicated: Local governments are 
tougher to get approvals from; there are environmental issues to consider; 
there's traffic and the lack of money to build new freeways; there are all 
sorts of new fees to contend with and an occasionally powerful, if unfocused, 
slow-growth movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall has dealt with all those problems as a private builder. Now he has to 
deal with most of them as a public figure -- in November he became president of 
the California Building Industry Assn., a big trade group and a powerful lobby 
for home builders. When he's not in Sacramento for the BIA, he's busy as 
president of La Linda Homes in Orange, which has carved out a niche in building 
big, expensive houses around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent conversation, he talked with staff writer Michael Flagg about the 
state of the home-building industry and what the powerful trade organization is 
up to these days. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's behind this slowdown in the market today, especially for the 
expensive houses you build? 
</P>
<P>
A. There really isn't a slowdown as such. There's actually a shortage of 
product. Inventories are quite low. There's a pretty good demand. Things are a 
little different now from what they were in '66 and '74 and '81 (when the 
housing market crashed). We're cyclical; we're always up and down somewhat. The 
economy's just taking a breather now. When the inventory's gone that's out 
there now we're going to come charging back just like we always have. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But your organization's own figures show that housing starts have been down 
the last few years in California. If it's not a slowdown, what is it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Our figures are going to show that '89 ended up having about 213,000 housing 
starts. We anticipate another 200,000 plus this year. That's not exactly a 
depressed economy. It's not too shabby. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the couple of years preceding 1989? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, '86 was the best year we ever had. We had 315,000 starts. In the last 
four years starts slowed up somewhat. The last four years of the decade weren't 
that great. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why have housing starts slowed down since 1986? 
</P>
<P>
A: I wish I could answer that. One big problem we've had is the artificially 
high pricing of land. It's just clear out of hand. We started seeing evidence 
of that in the last part of the decade. And we're finding some problems in the 
savings and loan industry that are affecting a lot of our builders. The 
medium-sized builder is probably the most vulnerable (in terms of finding 
construction loans now that many thrifts have left this comparatively risky 
business.) 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's their alternative? 
</P>
<P>
A. We're finding a huge move to more joint ventures than there's ever been 
before. Nationwide there might be only 50 savings and loans still making 
construction loans to builders or even joint venturing. I happen to deal with 
one of the more substantial ones, Great Western (Bank, in Beverly Hills) and 
they're not looking for new partners. They're being very discriminating. There 
are a lot of banks now looking at the home-building business and even some 
large corporations like Weyerhauser, General Electric and others. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Didn't companies like these once just buy home-building companies instead of 
doing joint ventures with them? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Before, they were buying a lot of companies because the building 
industry looked so inviting to them. A lot of those builders that were bought 
out ended up buying their companies back. Now these companies are joint 
venturing and putting up the equity capital, and that's the way most of us can 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Does it bother you that there seem to be fewer sources of capital for 
smaller builders, which could eventually mean less competition in the building 
industry? 
</P>
<P>
A. I don't look at it that way at all. The big builders, the master developers, 
a lot of them are joint venturing too. They'll buy thousands of acres of land 
at a time and invite other builders to come in and build, which means there are 
more people participating in the industry. It enables a lot of the smaller 
builders to take advantage of the expertise of the master developer in things 
like marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One hears that smaller builders -- people who may have started building 
while the market was hot -- are going through something of a shakeout these 
days with home sales slower. 
</P>
<P>
A. I think the real small builder is going to have some problems, because 
they're probably the ones who've gone to savings and loans to borrow money to 
build. But there'll always be a demand for a good custom-home builder. 
Particularly in Orange County, though, smaller builders are going to have 
problems because of the price of land, which has gone sky-high. 
</P>
<P>
But again, I deal with some of the top marketing people in the country and they 
tell me there's a lot of demand. It's the constraints on the supply that are 
really slowing things up. One thing that's happening is that in the 
mid-$400,000 to $500,000 price range -- I'm talking about Orange County now -- 
you can go out and find a lot of product. And there's really not a lot of 
difference in the design and construction. I think you will find that if the 
products have good design, good location and are reasonably and fairly priced, 
the sales aren't bad. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When you talk about constraints on supply, I assume you're talking about 
zoning and local government? 
</P>
<P>
A. One of the big problems we have in the industry is processing time. It's not 
unusual to find a project taking two to three years to get through the 
government hassles and bureaucratic red tape. One project we're doing, even 
though it's zoned properly and in the general plan, it's still taken us a year 
and a half and we're not even ready to start grading yet. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Red tape may be part of the problem, but isn't a major problem the fact that 
home prices have just gotten absurd in the last few years, with builders 
charging hundreds of thousands of dollars for a big ungainly house on a little 
postage stamp of a parcel? In other words, doesn't it seem as if most people 
can't afford the houses being built in Orange County today, and it's hard to 
see why people who can afford them would buy them? 
</P>
<P>
A. I have to agree. The cost of some homes seems ridiculous when you look at 
them. But it's all based on what you have to pay for the land, because there's 
a shortage here in the county and land's very expensive. Construction costs 
have stayed relatively the same. We've had times when they've gotten out of 
hand, and they're still out of hand somewhat. But they've stayed relatively 
stable. It all comes down to if you build a well-designed product it shows, and 
people will buy it. That's one of the things I find when I go out -- that 
there's an awful lot of sameness. One guy gets an idea and the next thing you 
know, everybody else is doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Like the Mediterranean style that's proliferated around southern Orange 
County in the last few years? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's probably dictated by what people want. We're doing some of that in 
our subdivisions. We're doing a lot of country French -- that had a little 
spurt -- and other types of more traditional architecture. Our marketing people 
tell us it's what people want. What matters is how well it's designed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One hears construction quality is a big problem these days; that between the 
haste with which builders threw up houses during the recent sales boom and the 
subsequent shortage of qualified construction workers, there are a lot of 
problems out there with shoddy construction. You must hear the same things. 
What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A. Oh, believe me, I think there still is (a problem). I couldn't agree with 
you more. I was on a project not long ago -- you go see what your competition 
is doing -- and I was appalled by the shoddy workmanship. It isn't just me; 
there are a lot of guys who feel just like I do, that quality is a problem. A 
lot of it was caused because in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a lot of the 
good people left the trade. Workers were in terrible scarcity when we started 
building again. The subcontractors have a problem getting help and we have a 
problem making sure our help is good help. It could be a big industry problem: 
But the good ones weed out the bad ones. It's kind of a self-policing thing. 
The ones that survive are the quality ones. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You've talked mostly about subcontractors. Don't the builders share some 
responsibility for this? Isn't some of this due to their cutting corners? 
</P>
<P>
A. Absolutely. That does a terrible injustice to those of us who are trying to 
build a good, quality product. A lot of us, over a period of time, have been 
perhaps so misguided in trying to get in while the getting's good -- you know 
the old saying, you make it while you can -- that you lose sight of (quality). 
There still are a lot of builders who are going to take the lowest (bid from a 
subcontractor) no matter what. That's something we've never done. You like 
competitive bids, but you want to find the guy who you think is going to be 
able to finish the job for you. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What do you do to prevent problems like this? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Contractors' State License Board is overburdened with (complaints about) 
quality and shoddy workmanship. All you have to do is pick up the little 
publication they send out and look at the licenses that are revoked every 
month. There are hundreds of them. So there are ways of dealing with this. And 
we sort of weed out the ones we don't want (at BIA). 
</P>
<P>
Q. Let's shift gears and talk about public policy. One of the biggest issues 
the BIA's been involved in is the 9-cent increase in the gas tax that goes 
before the voters in June. The money will go largely to building and widening 
roads. Yet you threatened to oppose the measure, which some political experts 
say is unlikely to pass without strong support from powerful groups like yours. 
Given the fact builders will be a chief beneficiary of new roads, why did you 
oppose it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Historically we supported a gas tax. Those funds could help alleviate the 
problems in our industry. What happened was the tax was coupled with a 
(traffic) congestion management plan that had noble motives but which just 
didn't work. It would have brought construction to a screeching halt. So we 
went to the Legislature and said we've got to have some changes in the bill and 
the doors were closed in our face. They would not even talk to us. So we had no 
choice but to come out and oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Isn't that like taking all your marbles and going home? That money could 
build a lot of roads. 
</P>
<P>
A. No, because we felt that time and time again (we were rebuffed). We hired 
more (lobbying) help than we've ever had before to say, "Hey, look, open some 
doors and let us come and talk to you." We wanted to compromise but we were 
just flat told: "Nope. This is the way it's going to be." We were the first 
major trade group to come out in opposition to it, and very quickly the 
California Assn. of Realtors joined forces with us, the teachers' association, 
we had many other groups saying it wasn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
Q. But one of the reasons the governor and some of the legislators didn't want 
to make any changes in the congestion plan was they were afraid the 
environmental groups supporting the gas tax would bolt. That didn't happen, and 
everybody eventually reached a compromise on changing the congestion plan, so 
will you now support the tax? 
</P>
<P>
A. Our task force agreed with the amendments (expanding the number of 
alternatives builders have under the congestion plan for improving traffic 
problems caused by their projects.) We'd just as soon not have it, period, but 
that's life in the real world. This next week we'll be meeting in Sacramento 
and our legislative committee will be going through the whole bill, and I think 
they'll probably OK it and we'll come out in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Well, the $64 question now is: Will it pass? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think so. We feel optimistic it will. Of course, I've voted for some 
losers in the past too. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Speaking of power, how much clout does your organization swing in 
Sacramento? 
</P>
<P>
A. I'd like to think we rank up there. In terms of numbers, the Realtors have a 
lot more members than we do. The teachers have more members than we do. But I 
think we're in the top rank. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's happened to the slow-growth movement? It seems quiescent in many 
places these days. 
</P>
<P>
A. Yeah, but . . . just because the river's quiet doesn't mean the alligators 
have left. I think what we'll find is we're going to be building coalitions 
between environmentalists, slow-growth people, builders -- we're all going to 
have to work together. We're going to have to realize we all have the same 
concerns. It may not always appear that way because of antagonism created by 
both sides. This is one of the goals we're going to be discussing in Sacramento 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
Q. That may be difficult, since builders have a lousy image with many 
Californians. How do you change that image? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think most builders are fine, reputable people who go out of their way to 
do what's best for a community. We just have to a better job of getting that 
across. We're very much aware of the problem, and we're launching a new program 
-- it's a huge, very expensive -- public relations thing. The whole program is 
based on letting the average person know what we do and what builders are all 
about. One rotten apple can ruin the whole barrel, and that's what's happened 
in the past. But any legitimate builder is interested in improving his image, 
because that benefits our industry too. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much money are we talking about? 
</P>
<P>
A: In the millions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Your organization has become a lot more litigious in the last few years, 
suing local governments and school districts over everything from slow-growth 
ordinances to the impact fees the schools charge builders. Has that been 
effective, considering that some of these cases probably don't do your image 
much good either? 
</P>
<P>
A. When we've sued it's been because of something terribly unjust, something 
unfair and inequitable. If you don't think a school fee, for instance, is 
justified, you just can't sit by and say "OK." If people knew how much fees add 
to the cost of a house, it would just shock them; it amounts to thousands and 
thousands of dollars. A lot of cities and counties will blame everything on 
Proposition 13 (which limited the amount of property tax local governments 
could collect and forced them to look elsewhere -- like at fees -- for 
revenue). I don't think they're correct. I don't know what the alternative (to 
the fees) is, but there's got to be one.

A WESTSIDE JOURNEY OF CONSCIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION HELPS MOLD HOUSEWIFE INTO RADICAL WITH ARREST RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Mary Brent Wehrli lives down a flowery lane in a lovely Spanish home in the 
hills of Brentwood. Her husband is a Century City lawyer, her daughter a 
first-year medical student at USC, her son a carpenter working on a teaching 
degree in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
But there ends the stereotype of the pampered Westside housewife. The 
47-year-old alumna of the Marlborough School and UCLA has a string of "gosh, I 
don't know, maybe 20" arrests, two as recent as January. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's that prominent photograph of her being hauled from a 
Republican Party fund-raiser Feb. 6 at the Century Plaza Hotel, where she 
interrupted President Bush's speech, appealing to him as a fellow Episcopalian 
to end U.S. military aid to El Salvador. The Los Angeles Times photo, by her 
own admission, shows her looking strident and angry, her blouse pulled open to 
expose her bra as she resisted a burly man yanking her away. 
</P>
<P>
How did it come to pass that this affluent Westside woman would get in the 
habit of provoking arrest and wind up infiltrating a $1,000-a-plate dinner to 
behave like that in front of her President? 
</P>
<P>
Wehrli may put her manners on hold occasionally, but not, in her view, her 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
To her, there are no contradictions in her story -- or voyage, as she calls it. 
It is a clear and steady progression of a religious woman from a sheltered and 
privileged background who has always taken things literally, including the 
Gospels. When her lifelong commitment to volunteer work and being a do-gooder 
started exposing her to poverty, Wehrli says she became increasingly 
radicalized, asking herself: "Just how many more pots can I make and how many 
pansies can I plant?" 
</P>
<P>
"All this talk of brothers and sisters, I mean to me they are. I don't see how 
people can be written off," Wehrli said recently, in her sunny manner. She was 
in her West Los Angeles office, where she directs the Southern California 
Interfaith Task Force on Central America, an organization that seeks to educate 
and mobilize the religious community against U.S. military intervention in 
Central America and to support refugees from that area. 
</P>
<P>
The journey that took Wehrli from complacency to activism was fresh in her 
mind. She had been asked to describe it at least three times that day at Loyola 
Marymount University during a teach-in on "the struggle in Central America," a 
response to the assassination of six Jesuit priests, their cook and the cook's 
daughter in San Salvador last November. 
</P>
<P>
"For me the journey began (when I started) doing social services at the 
Neighborhood Youth Assn. in Venice. Poor minority kids were not being served by 
government subsidy or program. I was appalled at how underfunded they were. 
Why? There was no lack of funding for nuclear weapons (or for military aid) in 
Central America." 
</P>
<P>
As Wehrli began to absorb the enormity of the conflict in Central America she 
recalled her lack of attention to the Vietnam War and said to herself, "This 
time I'm going to be one of the people who understand." 
</P>
<P>
She subscribed to -- and read -- "everything." She started to edit articles and 
compile them into a monthly newsletter that she sent, unsolicited, to about 60 
of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
"They still speak to me, the madwoman at home, but actually it helped me keep 
my sanity. I became more helpful, though, when I got involved in (the task 
force)." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she had also become active with Women of Conscience, an ad-hoc 
group of women from the church community who came together in the early 1980s 
to demonstrate and perform acts of civil disobedience to protest U.S. policies 
in Central America. Like Wehrli, many of these churchwomen have become 
increasingly radicalized, and, like her, many supply much of the paid and 
volunteer labor force of "the solidarity community" that fuels the movement. 
</P>
<P>
Wehrli has traveled to El Salvador and Guatemala twice, but she considers the 
trips a luxury. Her real work, she says, is here, trying to change U.S. policy, 
and she believes that change will occur if enough people demand it. 
</P>
<P>
At Loyola Marymount, Wehrli was in her element at lunchtime, standing behind 
her card table loaded with information on Central America, waving aside a plate 
of food with the explanation, "I'm sort of wired." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Joanne DeQuattro, a Catholic sister of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary 
who works at the Peace and Justice Center of Los Angeles, was also at the 
Loyola-Marymount teach-in. She first met Wehrli through Women of Conscience and 
fondly recalled their first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"She is without a doubt one of the most unique and credible people there is. 
She has an incredible ability to see the connections between U.S. policy on 
Central America and conditions (in the United States)." And Wehrli was making 
those connections at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"Four billion dollars were sent to El Salvador," she said. "Think what could 
have been done with that money at home" -- research toward a cure for AIDS, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Wehrli, who is "Mary Brent" to her friends, has a prim and proper look about 
her: little makeup, clear complexion, large no-nonsense glasses, graying hair 
pulled back in a low bun, usually tied with a colored ribbon. She dresses 
conventionally, except for occasional Central American embroidered or woven 
items. 
</P>
<P>
Her wardrobe is built on hand-me-downs and rummage, and she said she inflicted 
the same dress code on her kids when they were younger. Nor would she allow 
them to indulge in the trendy toys and games of their era. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in many respects a very austere parent. I'm not sure that's the way to 
be. Martin (her husband) is the loving, nurturing parent. I think I'm a bit of 
a fanatic, I suppose." 
</P>
<P>
Once, after her children were grown, her pastor, meaning no insult, suggested 
she talk to a group of prospective converts about " 'how you decided to put 
your work ahead of your family.' I started to cry. . . . In the traditional 
sense, there's no question he's right." 
</P>
<P>
But her daughter, Gail, said recently that she and her brother wouldn't have it 
any other way. Her mother "was not home baking cookies for me," Gail said, but 
she found her "loving, caring and tolerant of what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
About her parents' roles, Gail said: "They're very different. My father's much 
calmer. My mom is quite hyper." 
</P>
<P>
The Wehrlis could only laugh when they heard that assessment. Both described 
themselves as a team, and Martin said he agrees with his wife's politics. 
</P>
<P>
But would he do what she did to the President? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't got the guts for that. Besides, I'm a more private person." 
</P>
<P>
There is some guilt about the toll on her family, Wehrli admits, and about the 
nice house she lives in, and even about her priorities in her activism. It came 
up when she described how rewarding she finds her work. 
</P>
<P>
"Working with refugees one can only have hope," she said. "They've suffered 
such trauma and loss, and yet they know they'll be successful. The poor and 
downtrodden here do not have that hope. In fact, I've been evaluating how I can 
(justify) doing this work when our own cities are crumbling. I don't know what 
form it will take, but I'll be thinking of that next year. We have to find some 
way to build that hope back into people here." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the form, and regardless of the guilt and self-questioning, one thing 
seems fairly certain: There will be no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
At a workshop at Loyola that morning, called "Involving Yourself in El 
Salvador," the moderator had asked Wehrli what brought her to that moment with 
the President. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing that with George Bush was obviously not a first step for me. It was the 
result of 10 years. It was not whimsical. Prayer, thought and planning went 
into it. What advice I would offer people is: Always take a next step." 
</P>

CAREERS: APTITUDE TESTING IS BOOMING AS MORE PEOPLE STRIVE TO TRADE IN THE 
TREADMILL FOR PERSONAL SATISFACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott, an Orange County free-lancer, writes often for 
View, a move that, tests show, is in keeping with his keener aptitudes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a cocktail napkin. Fold it into an unusual geometric shape. Then take a 
paper punch and poke a single hole through the folds. 
</P>
<P>
Now, without opening the napkin, indicate on a chart where the holes will 
appear when the napkin is unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
It's torture. David Lyon may as well have asked for a quick sketch of a breeder 
reactor. 
</P>
<P>
The paper-folding task is typical of several tests given over the course of two 
days at the Johnson O'Connor Research Foundation's Human Engineering 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit foundation is a center for aptitude testing, perhaps the best 
known of a growing number of organizations and businesses where adults -- 
dissatisfied with their careers in early middle age, or simply feeling a vague 
sense of potential unfulfilled -- pay $450 to both confirm and uncover their 
true aptitudes. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has tested about 300,000 people since architect and aptitude 
researcher Johnson O'Connor first began administering tests to employees of the 
General Electric Co. in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people who come to us in their late 30s and early 40s come because 
they're not satisfied with what they're doing," said Lyon, director of Johnson 
O'Connor's Los Angeles office (there are 15 offices nationwide). "It isn't so 
much that they are feeling as though they're not capable of doing what they're 
doing, but that something is not quite right." 
</P>
<P>
The paper-folding test is the fourth in Johnson O'Connor's battery of 23 tests. 
It tends to make people who work with ideas and concepts want to scream, said 
Lyon. For engineers, it's duck soup. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day begins with a set of individual tests administered by Lyon, 
starting with two simple tests for color perception and hand and eye dominance, 
or "laterality." (Are you right-handed or left-handed and which eye do you 
favor?) 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's into the trenches, beginning with a test for observation. Lyon holds 
up a photo containing 20 common household objects -- a button, a safety pin, a 
coin purse and the like -- and you get to look at it for one minute. The 
picture then is taken away; a new one is shown, similar to the first. You must 
tell which objects have disappeared or moved to a different location in the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several different examples, and you get to look at the first photo 
-- the "master" -- for 12 seconds before each new photo is shown. Your 
responses are timed. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper-folding test follows, of which the less said the better. Unless 
you're Frank Lloyd Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to be a surgeon? Then score high on the next one: tweezer dexterity. Lyon 
presents a brick-sized block with 10 rows of 10 small holes drilled in one side 
and an identical number of holes and rows in the other. Your job: Pick the pins 
out of the holes on one side, one at a time, with a pair of tweezers and place 
them in the corresponding holes on the other side. You're timed. This test 
tends to make your eyes bug out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aptitude testing used to be associated with students rather than middle-aged 
adults. Testers say the ethic that governed the working world did not make any 
allowances for a career change. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the developmental process is that people have different needs at 
different points of their lives," said Albert Aubin, a senior counselor at 
UCLA's Placement and Career Planning Center. "A 22-year-old who makes a career 
decision makes it on the basis of the values that are necessary at that age. 
Those values do indeed change by the time that person is 35." 
</P>
<P>
A kind of career inertia, coupled with "almost a stigma attached to people who 
made career changes" often lock people into jobs with which they were unhappy, 
said Aubin. 
</P>
<P>
"But people are now taking a much more active role in their career 
development," he said. "They're seeing that change is OK. This has become much 
more acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Hewitt, a former high school teacher and career counselor who runs the 
education and career counseling firm Career Prep Enterprises in Brea, said that 
in the last five years, her number of adult -- as opposed to student -- clients 
has grown from 10-15% of her business to about 50%. 
</P>
<P>
"We're finding that people are not really happy, excited, passionately in love 
with what they're doing," she said. "They need to get quality in their lives. A 
lot of people fall into a career, and, all of a sudden, when they hit about 35 
or 40, they say, 'What am I doing? I'm getting up in the morning and I don't 
want to go to work.' It's a drag." 
</P>
<P>
At Johnson O'Connor's Los Angeles office, about two-thirds of those tested are 
adults in transition, generally from age 28 to 40, said Lyon, adding: "People 
are simply saying, 'I don't need to do (what I'm doing). It's more important to 
do something that makes me happy and I have to find out what it is.' " 
</P>
<P>
 You get three tries at the Martian words. On a screen, you are shown, one by 
one, 20 nonsensical (but pronounceable) words and their English equivalents 
(example, lokar: clock). After the last words are flashed, you turn over a 
piece of paper on which the "Martian" words are written. You provide their 
English translations from memory. The test is repeated two more times to see 
how your memory for words improves. 
</P>
<P>
 After a quick test to see how fast you can write -- it will come into play 
later -- comes the first of the auditory tests: pitch discrimination. A pair of 
electronically generated musical tones is played through a headset and you 
decide if the second tone was higher or lower in pitch than the first. Of 
course, it gets progressively harder, so that near the end the pitches are only 
a few vibrations apart on the tonal spectrum. There is much knitting of brows 
in the room (it's a group test) and, oddly, squinting and leaning forward, as 
if such actions would help anyone hear more clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 More musical testing follows with the rhythm memory section. Increasingly 
difficult rhythm patterns are played into your headset. Each pattern is 
followed by a second one, which is either the same as or different from the 
first; you have to decide which. After a while, it all begins to sound like a 
telegraph key. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aptitudes aren't skills, and they aren't knowledge. They can't be learned. They 
are innate abilities for learning to do certain things, and the prevailing 
belief is that they are inherited, said Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
"They're also needs, like eating and sleeping," he said. "If you have them and 
don't use them or if you place yourself in situations that call for those you 
don't have, you'll know. It will cause you anxiety and you may not know why." 
</P>
<P>
Many professionals, particularly lawyers, are frustrated, said Lyon, because 
they embraced their profession in deference to money or status or pressure from 
parents or peers, and ignored their aptitudes. 
</P>
<P>
He recalled a lawyer who tested at the fifth percentile in inductive reasoning 
("the area most needed for law"), but tested high in innate creativity and 
scored in the 85th percentile in structural visualization. Lyon said the man 
chose law because he believed it was a traditional progression from his 
undergraduate work at Yale. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he should be building things," said Lyon. "He smiled and said he 
had a workshop at home and generally he spent the whole weekend there working 
in his shop. I think he's going into engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 Day two begins with every humanities major's delight: numbers. Specifically, 
the number series and number facility tests. The first requires you to read 
several sequences of six numbers and write in the next logical number at the 
end of each sequence. The second involves arranging -- against the clock -- 
small groups of numbered chips into simple addition and multiplication 
problems. The first test measures how well you know your higher math, the 
second how well you balance your checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Next is a test -- word association -- to determine personality type. The 
results indicate whether a person has an objective or subjective personality 
(75% test objective). Objective people tend to be generalists, taking in a 
broad, encompassing point of view and usually working with, around or through 
other people. Subjective people tend to be specialists or experts, often 
working alone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, said Lyon, personality traits that reveal themselves through this 
testing "only apply to the work situation; in your personal life you could be 
completely the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
 The next test for inductive reasoning -- identifying pictures in a series that 
are related to each other in some way -- is the one Lyon said he considers the 
most significant of all. It is the ability to reason from the particular to the 
general, to see the relationships among a mass of ideas. In short, diagnostic 
thinking -- a need to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very dangerous aptitude," said Lyon, "because people who have it and 
don't use it are always finding fault with everyone and everything around them. 
They can't help themselves. It's just picky, picky, picky." 
</P>
<P>
 Aptitude testing is not universally accepted as the best or only way to plot 
one's professional future. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me like a very old-fashioned approach," said Jon Snodgrass, a 
psychologist who teaches human development and organizational behavior at Cal 
State Los Angeles and operates a career counseling business in South Pasadena 
called Career Strategies Center. 
</P>
<P>
Snodgrass said he uses information gleaned from personal interviews with 
clients to determine whether they are dominated by their left brain (the 
rational, calculating side) or the right brain (the creative side). He then 
designs specific exercises to help produce a balance between the emotional and 
the rational. Those heavily influenced by their left brain may become 
scientists but long to be musicians. However, said Snodgrass, they may not know 
the source of their dissatisfaction because they aren't naturally intuitive. 
Right brainers may be too emotional or undisciplined to make truly insightful 
career decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Structured testing, said Snodgrass, is, for left-brainers "like putting leeches 
on a bleeding person." It will do nothing to tap into their creative, 
insightful side. 
</P>
<P>
At the UCLA Placement and Career Planning Center, testing also is informal and 
not standardized. Aubin said two of the areas of greatest concentration at the 
center are what he called job satisfaction and work values -- what people want 
out of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, said Aubin, "if a person doesn't feel his current skills and 
abilities are being used, and that is a very important work value that he 
wants, there's going to be a lot of dissatisfaction. If recognition is 
important, and he's in a position where the boss gets the recognition, he won't 
be satisfied. You can have a very strong aptitude for something and still not 
like it." 
</P>
<P>
The center does use two specific tests that have become increasingly popular 
among career counselors: The Strong-Campbell interest inventory (to determine 
the types of activities people like) and the Meyers-Briggs personality 
indicator (to classify a person's personality into one of 16 types). 
</P>
<P>
Aubin said he didn't discount aptitude testing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we're against it," he said. "Aptitude tests are important. But 
you need a more complete picture." 
</P>
<P>
 There are more clenched jaws when the test measuring memory for design is 
administered. A geometric-type line drawing is projected on a screen for 12 
seconds. It then disappears. You have 45 seconds to reproduce it by connecting 
a series of dots on a piece of paper. There are several examples, and the eyes 
in the room stare harder and harder at each one, memorizing, memorizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Six more projected images follow, again simple drawings. You make a list, 
during the 45 seconds each image is on the screen, of what the drawings remind 
you of. The longer the list, the higher your foresight, which is the ability to 
keep your mind and actions on a distant goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The final test is for tonal memory. A series of electronically generated 
musical tones is played into your headset -- first only three, eventually eight 
-- and a second set is played immediately after. You circle the number on your 
test sheet that corresponds to the note in the sequence that changed in the 
second set of tones. The testees do not sigh when this one is over; there is an 
almost explosive exhalation of breath and everyone slumps heavily against the 
backs of the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Salesmen who might be psychologists. Lawyers who might be carpenters. Writers 
who might be diplomats. It's all hashed out in a final afternoon session at 
Johnson O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
There may be no absolutes, but the results can be telling. If, for instance, 
your profile indicates an unexpectedly high score on memory for design and your 
current job matches well with the rest of the profile, Lyon might suggest 
drawing as a hobby. If, however, you scored unusually high in inductive 
reasoning and you work on an assembly line, you may be urged to look for a 
different job. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not a question of use it or lose it, he said. It's a question of use 
it or be unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"With an aptitude," he said, "you'll never lose it. It's always been there. 
It'll always be there. It isn't influenced by where you were brought up or by 
how much education you have or in what areas you have it. It's just there. An 
aptitude is like a kid. If you have a child and you don't pay attention to it, 
it gets in trouble."

Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis and other critically acclaimed names in jazz 
highlight a three-concert contemporary-jazz series announced today by the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Modern Jazz Quartet, a long-running group that treats jazz with classical 
refinement, and the Kronos Quartet, a classical string quartet whose music 
bends eclectically in the direction of pop, rock and jazz, will open the series 
on April 22. 
</P>
<P>

RADIO PLAYLET DRAMATIZES AIDS DANGER TO LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The traditional sound of Nortena music fills the airwaves as a voice introduces 
"Tres Hombres Sin Fronteras" (Three Men Without Borders), a Spanish-language 
radio drama "about love, adventure and carelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is a radio novela, a soap-opera-like format popular in Latin 
America, but this one has a purpose beyond simply entertaining its listeners. 
The 15-part drama, which premieres today on several Spanish-language radio 
stations in Southern California, is aimed at "pre-literate" Latino migrant 
workers and is meant to educate them about the perils of AIDS and how to 
prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
The five-minute episodes chronicle the experiences of three fictional Mexican 
men who come to the United States to work as farm laborers. Sergio and Victor 
are both married and plan to send money home to their families. Marco is single 
and eager to meet "lots of little blondes." As the drama progresses, Marco and 
Sergio get involved with some prostitutes, while Victor, as the voice of 
reason, counsels both to protect themselves against sexually transmitted 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale ends on a tragic note: Sergio contracts AIDS and infects his pregnant 
wife with the deadly disease. When their child is born, he too has the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
"We're acknowledging that if young men -- and this is primarily directed to 
young men -- if they're going to be having sexual adventures, they ought to 
know the consequences," said Jack Shakely, president of the California 
Community Foundation, which is underwriting the project at a cost of about 
$150,000. "We're not condoning this practice but we're trying to be as logical 
and realistic as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to begin airing today on KTNQ-AM (1020) in Los Angeles, KDIF-AM 
(1440) in San Bernardino and KTRO-AM (1520) in Oxnard, and next week on KWKW-AM 
(1330) in Los Angeles, the drama is causing some concern among radio station 
officials because of its realism and frank language. 
</P>
<P>
"The reaction among staffers, and my own reaction, is it was done in somewhat 
poor taste," said Ernesto Portillo, station manager of KQTL-AM in Tucson, which 
aired the program in December. "It's a somewhat taboo subject and it's using 
raw language. . . ." Ken Wolt, general manager of KTNQ, was also concerned that 
the content might be offensive to listeners, so he plans to air the segments on 
weekday evenings at 9:55 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make sure it was presented in such a way and at such a time that 
we don't have people upset," Wolt said. "We wanted to do it because we think 
it's important, we feel it's a message that needs to be out: It's a dangerous 
situation and it's certainly critical for our audience, everybody really. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Socorro Valdez, co-writer of the novela, sees the program's frankness as the 
only way to convey the urgency of the message. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the gravity of AIDS and the way it's spreading in the Latino 
community, we didn't want to be delicate," Valdez said. "I think it's important 
that we deal with the issue directly. It is not fair to the community that we 
skirt around the issue and make it watered down." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shakely: "This is pretty graphic, there's no doubt about it. But you can't 
be too subtle in these types of announcements. . . . You have to pretty much 
say, 'Look, you do this, and this happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
The California Community Foundation is buying time on radio stations throughout 
the Southwest to ensure that it is heard, Shakely said. 
</P>
<P>
KWKW-AM will air the program Sunday nights at 10 p.m. for 15 weeks. KDIF-AM 
will broadcast it weeknights at 7:30 p.m. On KTRO-AM, it will be heard sometime 
between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on weeknights.

DRESHER AND ECKERT'S 'POWER FAILURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Power Failure" is a curiously descriptive title for Paul Dresher and Rinde 
Eckert's latest "electric opera." A big, serious morality play cum rock 
musical, it is musically and dramatically underpowered at the crisis moments. 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing impotent about the performance, however, Friday at the 
Wadsworth Theater. The Paul Dresher Ensemble gave "Power Failure" the full 
advantage of vigor and imagination in its local premiere. 
</P>
<P>
Eckert's libretto is a cyber-punk fantasy revolving around the greed and 
megalomania of dying pharmaceuticals executive Charles Smithson and his dotty 
chief researcher Ruth Lehmann. Their machinations have cost the life of the 
daughter of Merle Townsend, now a plant security guard who sets a revenge drama 
in action the night that the cure for all disease is discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The characters -- with the rather irrelevant and undermotivated addition of 
Judith Niles, mousy biographer of Smithson -- are all caricatures, but keenly 
drawn and acted. Their individual histories come together in a night of moral 
truth-or-consequence when Townsend traps them in an underground laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Olich's aluminum and neon set frames the action vividly, and Tom 
O'Horgan's direction keeps it apprehendable, moving and sardonically pointed. 
Eckert's text balances parody and pathos nimbly enough. 
</P>
<P>
But the climax is a disappointing evasion. Facing his doom, Smithson collapses, 
and Townsend's will to revenge evaporates. Lehmann almost incidentally destroys 
her invention, and "Power Failure" dissolves, with Smithson crooning to 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Dresher's supporting music -- much of the text is spoken, including Townsend's 
crucial narration -- is atmospheric, evoking smoky jazz on behalf of the film 
noir images or pitting deliberate pop banalities against some of Smithson's 
hypocrisies. It drives minimalist repetition with rock energies, backing 
wide-ranging vocal lines showing influences from Adams to Sondheim. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the characters has a song, usually strophic, explaining past history 
and current motivation. Though eminently tuneful and stylized, these songs 
seldom go beyond obvious text-setting. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the two acts culminates in an ensemble of sorts, though not of any 
psychological depth or polyphonic elaboration. These are the weakest points in 
the libretto, and Dresher's music does nothing to aid the cause but rise in 
manic density and volume. 
</P>
<P>
As Townsend, Eckert dominates the performance with an effortless presence, 
shifting easily from canny narration to his bumbling office persona to 
despairing revelations of the inner man. He also sings with grace and power. 
</P>
<P>
Opposite him is tenor John Duykers as Smithson. Duykers manipulates wheelchair 
and crutches with flamboyant skill, delivering the disintegrating arrogance of 
the villain with zest, while singing in a strained voice. 
</P>
<P>
Mezzo Stephanie Friedman gives Lehmann a suitably self-absorbed vulnerability, 
projected with focused, characterful singing. Soprano Thomasa Eckert soars on a 
wide vibrato into the vocal stratosphere as the deliberately pallid 
biographer/groupie. 
</P>
<P>
From a command post with keyboard, electric bass and computer, Dresher leads a 
strong band of four, rounded out by keyboardist Miguel Frasconi, percussionist 
Gene Reffkin and woodwind player Ned Rothenberg.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CYNICAL, ARROGANT, DUMB -- BUT NEVER A RACIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You write a column of opinion, you're called names. It comes with the turf. 
</P>
<P>
I've been accused of being dumb, evil, sinful, petty, arrogant, phony, cynical, 
vicious, hypocritical and dumber than dumb, all perhaps with justification. 
</P>
<P>
I've been called a facist. I've been called a communist. I've even been called 
a facist-communist. 
</P>
<P>
I've been called a Nazi and I've been called a dirty Jew. Someone else charged 
that I was such a self-hating Jew that I should return my circumcision. And one 
woman wrote me a letter insisting that I was so sexist that I deserved 
castration. 
</P>
<P>
I've also been labeled a homosexual more than once -- by persons who presumed 
that this, above all else, would cut me to the quick. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
What cuts me to the quick is being called a racist. 
</P>
<P>
One good thing about being called a racist: It makes you more careful about 
calling others racist. 
</P>
<P>
But that's the only good thing. 
</P>
<P>
The angry message on the telephone recorder said, "I thought your column was 
very racist." There were other calls and many letters saying essentially the 
same thing: that either I was racist or my column was. 
</P>
<P>
All right, you turn out a column contending that allegedly racist remarks 
attributed to "60 Minutes" commentator Andy Rooney -- which he denies making -- 
are not really racist, and you expect to be called racist yourself. You brace 
yourself and await the onslaught. Again, it comes with the job. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time I've been called a racist. 
</P>
<P>
It happened after I wrote critically about KABC Channel 7 sportscaster Jim 
Hill, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
It happened after I wrote a dumber-than-dumb negative review (since recanted 
many times) of that splendid CBS series "Frank's Place," most of whose cast was 
black. 
</P>
<P>
It happened when I defended Jimmy (The Greek) Snyder's bumbling remarks 
relating to the superiority of black athletes as being not racist, but 
essentially truthful. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably also happened other times that I no longer recall. 
</P>
<P>
Despite my experience at being called a racist, it still stings. 
</P>
<P>
Some might see this as a cover up, that "the truth hurts" and that "he doth 
protest too much," that what I subconsciously fear is that, deep down, I am 
exactly what I purport to loathe, and that failure to accept this is a form of 
self-denial. 
</P>
<P>
Well, we do accumulate a lot of baggage beginning in infancy, and there's no 
telling what's gathering dust in the sub-basements of our minds. Me a racist, 
though? Call me self-deluding, but . . . nahhhhh. 
</P>
<P>
Why, some of my best friends . . . no, scratch that. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, what bothers me most about all of this is how wildly and randomly the 
charge of racism is made these days, like unloading an AK-47 at a crowd to hit 
a single target. 
</P>
<P>
Hate and hurt linger in America, nourishing a siege mentality in which the 
worst is usually expected and the benefit of the doubt is rarely given. 
Television daily envelopes us in its angry, violent world, feeding our fears 
and suspicions, turning George Bush's kinder, gentler society into dreamy myth. 
We're not so scared of the Commies anymore, but isn't that a killer outside 
your door? A Colombian drug dealer hiding in your closet? A racist under your 
bed? 
</P>
<P>
Institutionalized bigotry does live, and given this nation's racist history 
(we're on safe ground using "racist" here, yes?), the hair-trigger paranoia is 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't make it any more rational or easy to live with, however. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the Andy Rooney incident, a point was reached where writing 
something critical about a black person -- or disagreeing with someone else's 
definition of racism -- positioned you at the end of a plank above waiting 
sharks. 
</P>
<P>
The government or thought police didn't censor you, but you were still in for a 
lot of trouble. To many of those who might disagree with you, you were not 
merely wrong, you were also racist. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of maturity is the ability to accept responsibility for the bad along 
with the good. In the present atmosphere, however, aggressive reporting on 
embattled Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion S. Barry, for example, is seen by some 
as automatically racist, as are stories seeming to put Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley in a harsh light. 
</P>
<P>
And in this environment, anyone challenging the prevailing wisdom that Rooney's 
alleged remarks were racist -- while also noting his slurs against gays -- is 
labled racist. I can't be merely dumb, evil, sinful, petty, arrogant, phony, 
cynical, vicious, hypocritical or dumber than dumb. I have to be racist. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't seem fair. However, that doesn't mean I hold a grudge or am 
prejudiced against those people who have made this foolish charge. After all, 
some of my best friends are fools.

CHAMORRO ELECTED IN VOTER REBUKE TO SANDINISTAS;

<TEXT>
<P>
In a stunning rebuke to 10 years of leftist Sandinista rule in this war-weary 
nation, opposition leader Violeta Barrios de Chamorro swept to victory in 
Nicaragua's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega, looking tired and shaken as it became clear early 
today that he had lost his reelection bid, promised in an emotional television 
address to respect the opposition victory. 
</P>
<P>
With 60% of the vote counted in Sunday's election, the Supreme Electoral 
Council gave Ortega and his Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) 41.5% 
of the presidential vote against 54.3% for Chamorro. 
</P>
<P>
Chamorro, the wealthy publisher of La Prensa newspaper, heads the National 
Opposition Union (UNO), a coalition of 14 groups that range across the 
ideological spectrum and were united primarily by their dislike of the 
Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
"The elections showed that Nicaraguans want to live in democracy, want to live 
in peace, and above all, in liberty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had predicted a Sandinista victory, and some political observers 
attributed Chamorro's triumph to the dire economic conditions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
She had political and financial support from Washington, which has backed the 
Contra rebel war against the Sandinistas and imposed economic sanctions on the 
impoverished nation. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who once likened Ortega to a skunk, hailed Chamorro's victory, 
praised the Sandinistas for holding free elections and called for immediate 
restoration of a cease-fire between Managua and the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the opposition by name, Ortega said: "Yesterday, thousands 
and thousands of Nicaraguans cast their vote for the political force (UNO) 
which I consider should start governing Nicaragua from April 25," the date set 
for the transfer of power. 
</P>
<P>
"The president of Nicaragua will respect and accept the popular mandate arising 
from the vote," said Ortega, 44, who joined the fledgling Sandinista revolution 
as a youth and became president in 1984 polls largely boycotted by the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming victory three hours earlier, Chamorro, 60, vowed to work for 
reconciliation in a country deeply divided by the eight years of Contra war, 
which has killed about 30,000 people and wrecked the economy. 
</P>
<P>
UNO's platform pledged to end the Contra war and abolish compulsory military 
service. It guaranteed that peasants will retain property rights to land they 
received in Sandinista land reform and also promised people whose land was 
illegally confiscated that their property will be returned or they will be 
compensated if it was occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing cheers from supporters, Chamorro added: "There will be no victor, no 
vanquished." 
</P>
<P>
The president-elect came to prominence after the January, 1978, assassination 
of her husband, publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, long a vehement critic of the 
Somoza family dynasty. Outrage at his murder helped turn the Sandinista 
struggle into a broad-based popular revolt, which toppled Gen. Anastasio Somoza 
in July, 1979.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY SELECTS ST. CLAIR AS MUSIC DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl St. Clair, one of two assistant conductors of the Boston Symphony, today 
was named music director of Orange County's Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair -- at 37 the youngest of nine announced candidates for the position 
-- will assume his duties Oct 1. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of a three-year contact, St. Clair will oversee artistic 
development and planning for the orchestra and will conduct six pairs of 
classical concerts each season at the Orange County Performing Arts Center and 
two concerts in the summer season at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. In addition, 
he will oversee school and community outreach programs. St. Clair and orchestra 
officials would not disclose his salary. 
</P>
<P>
His appointment ends a search that began in February, 1988, with the 
resignation of founding music director Keith Clark after a bitter power 
struggle with the board of directors. The search made headlines earlier this 
month when previous front-runner Lawrence Foster said the Pacific had offered 
him the job in December but withdrew the offer after talks broke down over 
salary and rehearsal demands and, apparently, residency requirements. The 
orchestra management has refused to comment on Foster's statements. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair also is music director of the Ann Arbor (Mich.) Symphony and the 
Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y. He said today that he would maintain 
one of those posts in addition to his job with the Pacific but that he has not 
yet decided which he will give up. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that he will maintain a residence in Orange County but that it 
will not be his exclusive address. However, he said, "I intend to spend as much 
time here as needed and as much time as I can."

BUSH PRAISES VOTE, MAY LIFT SANCTIONS SOON

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today hailed Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's upset election in 
Nicaragua and called for "peaceful transition" to democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said he will decide swiftly on lifting the economic 
sanctions that hindered the Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said there is "no reason at all for further military activity from any 
quarter." For most of a decade, Contra rebels supported by the United States 
have waged war against President Daniel Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
Bush spoke as key members of Congress said the United States should anticipate 
providing substantial economic aid to the new government in Managua. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III embraced Chamorro's triumph and praised 
the defeated Nicaraguan president for carrying out a fair election. He said he 
hoped the election would lead to a national reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bush: "For years the people of Nicaragua have suffered. And today the 
people of Nicaragua have spoken." 
</P>
<P>
The President said he had talked with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez 
about "appropriate trade and economic measures that we can take to support the 
new government of Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
Bush did not address the issue of sanctions directly. But White House spokesman 
Marlin Fitzwater said the President will decide "fairly soon" on whether to 
lift them. 
</P>
<P>
On May 1, 1985, then-President Ronald Reagan ordered a U.S. embargo on all U.S. 
exports to or imports from Nicaragua; a ban on all flights to and from the 
United States by Aeronica, the Nicaraguan airline; a ban against 
Nicaraguan-registered ships from entering U.S. ports, and a termination of the 
Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the sanctions and economic reprisals had been instrumental in 
forcing Ortega out, as well as the creation of the Contras, Fitzwater said:

COURT LEAVES INTACT MILITARY'S GAY BAN; 
</P>
<P>
HOMOSEXUAL: APPEAL REJECTED ON CALIFORNIAN RELEASED BY NAVY, AND WISCONSIN 
LESBIAN DENIED RE-ENLISTMENT.

The Supreme Court today left intact the U.S. military's general ban on 
homosexuals serving in the Army and Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, rejected appeals by a California man released from 
Navy active duty because he is gay and a woman denied re-enlistment in the Army 
Reserve in Wisconsin because she is a lesbian. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Woodward of Spring Valley, Calif., challenged the Navy's general ban 
on homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
He enlisted in 1972 for a six-year hitch in the Naval Flight Officer Candidate 
Program. He was allowed to enter the Naval Reserve program even though he had 
answered "yes" to a questionnaire that asked whether he was sexually attracted 
to men or desired sex with men. Woodward answered "no" to a question whether he 
had ever engaged in homosexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
He completed flight school training and was commissioned as an ensign in the 
Naval Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward was serving in an air squadron stationed in the Philippines when in 
1974 he was seen in the Subic Bay Officers' Club sitting with a sailor who was 
to be discharged for homosexual conduct. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy generally bars homosexuals but has retained some. 
</P>
<P>
When questioned by his commanding officer, Woodward acknowledged his homosexual 
tendencies. After Woodward refused to resign, the commanding officer 
recommended to the chief of naval personnel that Woodward be discharged. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy did not discharge Woodward but released him from active duty and 
assigned him to the Naval Air Reserve staff in San Diego. He served there until 
1978, when he completed his six-year military obligation. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward sued in 1976, alleging that he had been unlawfully separated from 
active duty. The suit sought back pay and reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Claims Court dismissed Woodward's suit, and the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Federal Circuit upheld the dismissal last March 29. 
</P>
<P>
"Woodward was not discharged for homosexuality; rather he was considered for 
reassignment, but because of his mediocre record as an officer and his 
homosexuality he was ultimately released from active duty," the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Army Reserve Sgt. Miriam Ben-Shalom, 41, is stationed in Milwaukee and has been 
allowed to remain in the military pending the outcome of her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The actions today were not rulings on the legality of the military ban but 
simply a summary rejection of the appeals. The justices did not preclude the 
possibility that in some future case they will agree to review the policy 
toward homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Refused to force the CIA to release its documents on the 1985 sinking of 
the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior by French government agents. The justices 
let stand rulings that the spy agency may withhold the documents from a Houston 
lawyer who is seeking them under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Said it will decide whether a federal law that requires some losers of 
lawsuits to pay the winners' lawyer fees also covers fees for expert witnesses.

New York Times heiress Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, whose spunk and adventurous 
spirit charmed royalty and enamored presidents, died in her sleep early today. 
She was 97. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Finn, assistant to Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Mrs. Sulzberger's son and 
publisher of the Times, said Mrs. Sulzberger died of natural causes at her home 
in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Sulzberger's role as a trustee of the family fortune and as the daughter, 
wife, mother-in-law and mother of Times publishers brought her power and 
prominence. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, New York Times Publisher Adolph S. Ochs, appointed her to the 
newspapers' board of directors in her 20s. After his death in 1935, she was one 
of three trustees, along with her husband and then her son, of the Ochs estate, 
which owns the controlling interest in the Times. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapering was the birthright of Iphigene Bertha Ochs, the granddaughter of 
Rabbi Isaac M. Wise, founder of Judaism's Reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
She married Arthur Hays Sulzberger on Nov. 17, 1917, capping their Washington 
honeymoon at a White House meeting with President Woodrow Wilson. When Ochs 
died, Sulzberger succeeded him as publisher of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband retired in 1961. Their son-in-law, Orvil E. Dryfoos, held the 
publisher's post until dying in May, 1963. Their son, known as Punch, has been 
the publisher since then. Their grandson, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., is now 
deputy publisher.

on Thursday morning. He said about 500 Forbes employes are expected to be in 
attendance.

SOVIET TANKS WITHDRAW FROM CZECHOSLOVAKIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-two Soviet tanks left this northern Moravian city today, beginning the 
Red Army's withdrawal from Czechoslovakia nearly 22 years after Moscow sent 
troops to crush "Prague Spring" reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The pullout began as Czech President Vaclav Havel announced in Moscow today 
that the Soviet Union agreed to pull all its 73,500 troops out of 
Czechoslovakia by July 1 next year. 
</P>
<P>
Few people came to wave goodby to the Soviet troops today, and those who did 
showed little emotion. 
</P>
<P>
A brass band struck up the "Internationale," the Communist anthem, during a 
brief ceremony inside the Soviet base at Frenstat that kicked off the first 
complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from any of Moscow's allies. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet troops entered Czechoslovakia with a Warsaw Pact invasion that 
smashed the 1968 reforms. But in November, 1989, a peaceful revolution toppled 
the hard-line Communists and the new government immediately began talks on 
withdrawing all Red Army troops. 
</P>
<P>
To Czechoslovaks, the Soviet troops "meant empty shelves in stores, polluted 
water, an occasional fight in the pub and a reminder that we are not a free 
country," said Karel Micek, a spokesman for the Civic Forum movement. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal from Frenstat pod Radhostem, 110 miles southeast of Prague, was 
accompanied by a parallel pullout from Krnov on the Czechoslovak-Polish border, 
150 miles east of the Czechoslovak capital. They are to be completed by March 
13 and March 25 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, after meeting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow, said the 
two countries' foreign ministers, Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Jiri Dienstbier, 
had signed an agreement on the withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Havel also said he and Gorbachev had signed a declaration on bilateral 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Havel told journalists that Gorbachev said it was possible Soviet troops would 
leave Czechoslovakia before the June 30, 1991, deadline set in the agreement 
and even as early as a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it is quite possible they will leave fully within a year. But in the 
agreement we would leave the date as June 30 so that if they are unable to do 
it in a year it will not look as though either side were not fulfilling its 
obligations." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for the departure of Soviet forces in three stages and 
for the majority of the troops to be out of Czechoslovakia by May 31 this year. 
The second phase would be completed by December and the third by July 1, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia's coalition government had originally demanded all Soviet troops 
out by the end of this year, but Havel told the U.S. Congress last week the 
most important thing was for most of them to go before elections in June.

S.F. HOTELS CUT RATES TO LURE TOURISTS BACK

<P>
Room rates at even luxury hotels are falling fast as hoteliers find the 
traditionally slow winter months even more sluggish than usual in the wake of 
the October earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Chronicle reported today that rates at many inns have been 
slashed by 20% to 40%, and more in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
Observers cite tourists' fears of another earthquake such as the one Oct. 17 
that killed 67 people in the San Francisco Bay Area, and an oversupply of hotel 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The number of hotel rooms in San Francisco increased 7% last year to 27,600, 
while occupancy rates dropped to about 70%, the break-even point for the 
average hotel. And an additional 1,400 rooms are scheduled to come on the 
market later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel officials say business in January and February slipped as much as 10%. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Mark Hopkins hotel cut rates 43% to $99 for a limited number 
of rooms during the last few months, and is offering spring discounts for the 
first time. The Sheraton at the Wharf is offering double-occupancy rooms at $95 
a night, rather than its regular $120. 
</P>
<P>
"The competition is so fierce that I'm seeing rates for weekdays that used to 
be reserved for weekends only," said Stan Streeter, a hotel analyst with the 
accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, discounts haven't done enough. 
</P>
<P>
HBR Hotels, owner of five San Francisco hotels whose revenues have dropped 
about 7%, has changed the way it spends its $120,000 quarterly marketing 
budget, opting for brochures targeting Japanese tourists.

PIPER CLOSES PLANT FOR 2 WEEKS, LAYS OFF OVER 75% OF WORKERS

Financially troubled Piper Aircraft Corp. shut down its plant here for two 
weeks today and laid off more than three-fourths of its workers, a company 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ponte, director of marketing, said that the layoffs are the result of a 
severe cash crunch and that the company does not plan to seek protection from 
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
About 580 workers will be on an extended layoff, he said. The rest of the 
nearly 1,100 employees will return to work March 12, after the shutdown, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a tremendous backlog in aircraft on order," Ponte said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 people remain on the job to help deal with backlogs in aircraft 
deliveries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Piper, which manufactures aircraft for general aviation, was purchased by 
California investor M. Stuart Millar from Forstmann Little &amp; Co. in 1987. 
No purchase price was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Ponte said the company will go to a four-day workweek after the shutdown to 
help the company get back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
He said the problems resulted from a rapid expansion of the company after 
Stuart Millar bought the company in 1987.

East Germany today began accepting applications for unemployment benefits for 
the first time in the Communist nation's 40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial estimates contend that 70,000 East Germans are unemployed, but Labor 
Ministry spokesman Joachim Guenter said the number of applicants is far lower 
than had been expected. Authorities had speculated that about 4,000 people 
would seek the new insurance. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of unemployed is relatively low among East Germany's 9 million 
workers, the figure is expected to shoot up to as much as 15% after competitive 
Western practices are introduced.

PROBE OF NURSING HOME INSURANCE ABUSE URGED

Vulnerable older Americans are being duped into buying expensive nursing home 
insurance policies that fail to deliver the promised protection against 
staggering long-term care costs, a private advocacy group said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Families USA Foundation called for a government inquiry into what it said 
are widespread abuses in the long-term care insurance market, including 
misrepresentations by insurance agents, company refusals to pay benefits and 
extensive payment delays. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much evidence of insurance industry abuse of frail elderly 
consumers that the Federal Trade Commission should investigate," said Ron 
Pollack, executive director of the foundation. The problems include top-rated 
companies as well as fly-by-night operations, the foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, it said, an insurance agent visited a 74-year-old widow in 
Minnesota in the hospital to collect her first premium and later denied her 
nursing home benefits because she was hospitalized when she bought the policy. 
</P>
<P>
In another, an elderly Iowa man was promised that he need never worry about 
paying for a nursing home if he bought a policy that turned out to be so 
restrictive it would not cover 97% of the nursing home beds in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Insurance Assn. of America issued a statement in response that said 
it would welcome an FTC investigation "because we are convinced it will reveal 
that abuses are the exception, not the rule." 
</P>
<P>
It said Families USA was calling for a government inquiry in hopes of promoting 
"an outdated, big-government approach to long-term care." 
</P>
<P>
Families USA believes the best solution to the long-term care problem is a 
broad-based social insurance program akin to Social Security or Medicare, with 
private insurance playing only a supplementary role. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40% of all elderly will spend some time in a nursing home, with 
half of all stays lasting six months or less and the other half averaging 2 1/2 
years, according to the health insurance association. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the House Energy and 
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the foundation's 
report is in line with what his investigators are finding. 
</P>
<P>
"When untamed avarice and constant prevarication become the trademarks of a 
product, it is time for reform," Dingell said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), also on the subcommittee, said the report would 
provide added impetus for federal regulation of the nursing home insurance 
market.

'RESCUE 911' TO SHOW FOOTAGE FROM STUART CASE

<P>
Dying Carol Stuart and her seriously wounded husband, Charles, lie in their 
bloody car on a Boston street -- and you can watch the real thing from your 
living room. 
</P>
<P>
You can hear Stuart -- the real Stuart, not an actor -- plead with paramedics 
to take care of his wife before tending to him. Later, he would be suspected of 
having shot both her and himself, and ultimately he killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
The case made headlines around the country, but the CBS show "Rescue 911" was 
in at the beginning. On the night of Oct. 23, 1989, "Rescue 911," a show that 
dramatizes real cases, using as much real footage and people as possible, was 
with one of the Boston Emergency Medical Service ambulances that arrived on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
The footage the camera crew took that night is part of the segment on the 
Stuart case that airs on the show Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The segment opens with the actual tape of Stuart's desperate call from his car 
phone, telling dispatchers he and his wife had been shot but that he could not 
give his location. 
</P>
<P>
It makes a good news story, the way the heroic husband had held on and gotten 
help for himself and his pregnant wife; the resourcefulness of Boston police 
and Massachusetts State Troopers in finding them. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the 911 dispatchers hear a police siren coming through the phone 
line from the now-unconscious Stuart. The police dispatcher has all radio cars 
in the area cut their sirens. Then one by one they sound off, until the 911 
crew hears a siren. That gives them a good fix on the location. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic material comes when the ambulances arrive on the scene and 
host William Shatner informs you that what you are about to see is not a 
simulation. 
</P>
<P>
You see two bloody people in their car. You see paramedics cut Carol Stuart 
loose from her seat belt and pull her from the car. She is rushed to a 
hospital. You are told her child was delivered by Cesarean section. She died 
within hours; the child died 17 days later. 
</P>
<P>
The camera crew follows Stuart into the ambulance, and later to the emergency 
room of Boston City Hospital where he lies almost naked as doctors work on him. 
Over and over he asks about his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Other segments of "Rescue 911" detail the struggle of U.S. Marine rescue units 
and doctors at a trauma center in Orange County to save the life of a pilot who 
survived the crash of his jet fighter; and the race of a Jackson, Miss., woman 
to stop an out-of-control car after the driver suffered an apparent heart 
attack.

Spike Lee says sex, not race, will generate a lot of heat in his new film, "Mo' 
Better Blues." 
</P>
<P>
"The audience may squirm," Lee said in the March 5 issue of People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million film starring Denzel Washington is about a trumpet player torn 
between his love of music and his desire for two women, a singer played by 
Cynda Williams and a Harlem schoolteacher played by Lee's sister, Joie. 
</P>
<P>
Joie Lee said she had no problem working with her brother in scenes that called 
for nudity. 
</P>
<P>
"When he said, 'OK, take off your top,' I just did it. It's not perverse," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the love scenes are tasteful, "but when I think of going to see 
the movie with my parents and grandparents, it freaks me out." 
</P>
<P>
Lee's last film, "Do the Right Thing," examined racism with a tragic 
confrontation at a pizza parlor.

After months of speculation and rumor that Jack Valenti was about to retire as 
president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America -- with names of possible 
replacements even being bandied about -- it will be announced today that he 
will be signing a new five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
The chief lobbyist of the movie industry, the 69-year-old Valenti has been 
president of MPAA for 24 years. He has also achieved some fame as one of the 
most familiar and frequently seen faces on-stage at Academy Awards night. He is 
only the third president of the MPAA, founded in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
Valenti, a Texan, was a special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson before 
being sworn in as MPAA president in 1966.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: VITAMIN C ISN'T CURE TO COMMON COLD, BUT IT MAY HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Q. Does Vitamin C really work for colds? Yesterday I saw my doctor, hoping he 
could prescribe an antibiotic for the awful cold I've got. He said that I 
needed Vitamin C, rest and fluids instead of any medicine he could prescribe. 
When I asked him how much Vitamin C, he suggested around one or two grams. 
</P>
<P>
My pharmacist said Vitamin C was worthless and recommended Alka-Seltzer Plus 
Cold Tablets. Who should I believe? 
</P>
<P>
A. Your doctor was right not to prescribe an antibiotic against this viral 
infection. It wouldn't have worked. Vitamin C, however, just might be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Elliot Dick of the University of Wisconsin is one of the country's leading 
cold researchers. He has discovered that 500 milligrams of ascorbic acid taken 
four times a day helps relieve cold symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Dick has found that the amount of Vitamin C that gets into white blood cells is 
highly variable. Some people need to take much more than others to achieve 
adequate levels within the cells. Dick is launching a new study to determine 
the effectiveness of varying amounts of Vitamin C against cold symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I was first diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis back in 1922, and I have 
suffered with it ever since. None of the special dandruff shampoos or 
treatments dermatologists prescribed ever did much. 
</P>
<P>
Just on a hunch this year, I tried a couple of sample tubes of Nizoral my 
doctor had given me for a different problem. I had enough to rub it on my scalp 
for four days, and it stopped the dandruff short in its tracks. Six weeks 
later, I saw the doctor again, and although he inspected the scalp closely, he 
could find no evidence of the seborrheic dermatitis. 
</P>
<P>
He prescribed a regular-size tube of Nizoral, and I used it for 10 days. That 
was several months ago, and I still can't raise any dandruff at all. I know 
that one case is not scientific, but thought you'd like to hear about my 
success. 
</P>
<P>
A. We love good news. Researchers are discovering that bad dandruff and 
seborrheic dermatitis may be caused by a yeast infection that responds nicely 
to antifungal drugs like Nizoral (ketoconazole). 
</P>
<P>
It is kind of messy to rub the cream onto your scalp. But the maker of Nizoral 
has a special shampoo formulation that is marketed abroad. It is awaiting 
approval from the Food and Drug Administration and will be available sometime 
this year.

Andrew Young, who is trying to become Georgia's first black governor, took to 
the pulpit at a rural Baptist church where the whites were the Sunday regulars 
and the blacks were the guests. 
</P>
<P>
The service at the First Baptist Church was a twist on the decades of white 
politicians' preaching at black churches, with white visitors sitting in the 
pews. 
</P>
<P>
Young, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a former Atlanta mayor, is 
a Congregationalist minister. 
</P>
<P>
He took his text from Paul's letter to the Ephesians: "For he is our peace, who 
has made us both one, and has broken down the dividing wall of hostility." 
</P>
<P>
During the sermon, Young spoke of a "transformation of our politics" that has 
worn out the metaphor of America as a melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all in the same pot, but it is not so much like a 
least-common-denominator soup. It is more like a stew -- our differences only 
enhance and enrich," he said.

Donald Trump seems surprised that his split with his wife, Ivana, has been such 
a running story in the New York tabloids and the British press. In a 
rush-to-print interview in the upcoming New York magazine, the billionaire 
developer expressed surprise that coverage of the Steven Spielberg-Amy Irving 
and Jane Fonda-Tom Hayden splits were such one-day stories, while his goes on 
and on. 
</P>
<P>
He said that women he has never met are "saying that I was with them, too. 
Because they'll get some publicity. . . . Famous women, I could give you their 
names . . . have been calling the newspapers, their agents have been calling, 
saying they were with me, trying to get their pictures in one of the so-called 
conquests." 
</P>
<P>
Trump has especially harsh words for some of Ivana's pals in the wealthy social 
set, who are generally siding with her in Trump: The Divorce. "I generally find 
them to be extremely unattractive people, among the most unattractive I've ever 
met. I find women that buy $25,000 dresses -- they try to make themselves more 
attractive by putting on $25,000 dresses, and then they walk into the ballroom 
and nobody notices them anyway."

EX-COWBOYS OWNER BRIGHT ALMOST FIRED LANDRY IN '87

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Dallas Cowboys owner H. R. (Bum) Bright says he wanted to sack Tom 
Landry in 1987 but couldn't talk Tex Schramm into doing it. 
</P>
<P>
A year after selling the Cowboys to Jerry Jones, Bright said his one regret is 
that he didn't fire Landry himself. He didn't because Schramm, the team's 
general manager at the time, told him he didn't have a replacement ready. 
</P>
<P>
Jones continues to take criticism for firing Landry and installing Jimmy 
Johnson, his longtime friend and former Arkansas Razorbacks teammate, as head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known there would have been this much heat over Tom, I'd have taken 
it myself," Bright said Sunday in the Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that Jerry doesn't deserve all this stuff. It wouldn't have been as 
hard for me as it has been for Jerry, because he was the one continuing. I just 
didn't realize," Bright said. 
</P>
<P>
Bright praised Schramm as a "born promoter" and said he was responsible for 
bringing success to the Cowboys. But Bright said Schramm also realized the 
Cowboys were skidding downhill fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Something needed to be done," Bright said. "A new direction was needed on the 
coaching staff from Tom on down. But despite the fact he appears gruff at 
times, Tex is a sentimentalist. He didn't have the stomach to do what needed to 
be done." 
</P>
<P>
Bright said Jones may be getting a bad rap about having handled Landry's firing 
in a cold-hearted fashion. He said Jones had insisted two days before a news 
conference to announce the team's sale and coaching changes that there would be 
no deal until he personally talked to Landry. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the day before the deal was finalized, Schramm joined Bright and 
Jones at Bright's offices, and Schramm called Landry to inform him that Jones 
was bringing in his own coach, Bright said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones wanted to meet with Landry personally that afternoon, but the meetings 
broke up late and Landry had already left the Cowboys' practice facility.

Lee Trevino's putting has given a big boost to his daughter's driving.

Trevino capped another lucrative weekend on the Senior PGA Tour by rolling in a 
15-foot birdie putt Sunday on the final hole of the Chrysler Cup to win a new 
LeBaron convertible. 
</P>
<P>
The car went to the player with the lowest final round. Trevino tied Don Bies 
for the honor with a 3-under-par 69 and won the contest because he birdied No. 
18, the tiebreaker hole. 
</P>
<P>
Easy come, easy go. The hottest player in golf said he'll give away the car. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got all the Toyotas in the world," said Trevino, who does commercials for 
the Japanese auto maker. "I've got a daughter, Lesley -- 23 years old, and 
she's never asked me for a thing. I think my daughter needs this car real bad."
