<TEXT>
<P>
Marcel Jacno, 84, a graphic artist who designed the Gauloises Bleues cigarette 
package and labels, posters and packages familiar to millions of Frenchmen and 
millions of others worldwide. They included the Courvoisier cognac label, the 
masthead of the newspaper France Soir and posters for the Comedie Francaise, 
Paris Opera and other leading theaters. The square, squat Gauloises package, 
decorated with a winged helmet and his signature in tiny print in the bottom 
right corner, became the most familiar. In Paris on Wednesday.

NEW CITIZENS GROUP OPPOSES PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF SDG&amp;E 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J. T. (Tom) Hawthorne, a California Transportation Commission member from 
Escondido, announced Monday the creation of a citizens committee opposed to a 
government takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, composed of several well-known county residents, was formed 
because of fears that municipalization of the utility would lead to a drop in 
service and higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm conviction that the private sector is a more appropriate 
operator of utilities than the public sector," Hawthorne said in a prepared 
statement. "Public takeover would result in poorer service and higher rates." 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of SDG&amp;E has agreed to merge with SCEcorp, the 
parent company of Southern California Edison, and the two companies are seeking 
the approval of the state Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear Loss of Control, Jobs 
</P>
<P>
The merger is vehemently opposed by those who believe it will mean a loss of 
local control and local jobs. Mayor Maureen O'Connor has come out against the 
merger, as has another group called the Committee for Local Control, headed by 
Gordon Luce, chairman of the board of Great American First Savings Bank. Luce's 
committee, however, has not taken a stand on municipalization. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the San Diego County Water Authority has embarked on an analysis of 
the feasibility of taking over SDG&amp;E, a proposal sharply opposed by the 
utility. 
</P>
<P>
The new committee announced Monday, while specifically formed to oppose any 
government takeover, has not taken a stand on the SDG&amp;E-SoCal Edison 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, called Taxpayers Against Government Takeover, has asked for 
"seed money" from SDG&amp;E to help it get organized, though Hawthorne said the 
group will also draw on private donations and contributions from other 
investor-owned utilities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Study, Opinion Polls 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne said two recent developments have reinforced his committee's 
opposition. One is a study by consultants CH2M Hill "indicating a possible 23% 
jump in utility rates if a government takeover did occur." The second are two 
opinion polls, including one done by The Times, which show that citizens are 
opposed to municipalization. (The Times poll also showed strong opposition to 
the merger.) 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the committee include Gil Contreras, vice president of 
Contreras Brothers Construction Development Corp.; Bob Watkins, an executive 
search consultant from San Diego; Fred Schnaubelt, a former San Diego city 
councilman and now a Chula Vista real estate broker, and Gary Clasen, La Mesa 
district manager of the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Others identified by Hawthorne as also opposed to a government takeover of 
SDG&amp;E were Mac Strobl, a former San Diego city councilman and a public 
relations consultant; Jack Raymond, a North County developer and former 
president of the San Diego Economic Development Corp.; Leonard Knight, an 
executive with the Epilepsy Society, and Bud Wilson, a Chula Vista insurance 
executive.

CHEMICAL FIRE CLOSES OTAY MESA ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fire officials closed half a mile of Maxwell Road near the Otay Mesa landfill 
Monday after a chemical fire broke out at a hazardous-waste disposal company 
near the dump's entrance, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which started about 6 a.m. and produced a small, poisonous cloud, 
occurred when workers at Appropriate Technologies II were moving 15 to 20 steel 
and plastic barrels, containing dry chlorine and toxic soil, and six of the 
plastic drums ignited, said Sam Schreck, Chula Vista fire inspector. 
</P>
<P>
The workers at the company, in the 1700 block of Maxwell Road, controlled the 
flames, which erupted from an apparent chemical reaction, Schreck said. None of 
the steel barrels caught fire, but they did bulge from the heat of the burning 
plastic barrels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Teams from the San Diego County and San Diego hazardous materials units 
answered the alarm, along with Chula Vista firefighters, Schreck said. They 
used water from fire hoses to break up the small toxic cloud, which was about 
30 feet above the yard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After two firefighters wearing protective suits and breathing equipment entered 
the blaze area, the agencies decided to inspect each drum, Schreck said. 
</P>
<P>
They found some of the remaining dozen drums to still be hot, he said. Those 
drums were reopened, broken down into smaller five-gallon containers, then 
treated in a thermal reactor, which neutralizes the chlorine, Schreck said. The 
contents of the remaining barrels were repacked into sterile drums and also 
neutralized. 
</P>
<P>
Schreck said the company did not appear to have violated any toxic-waste 
disposal regulations but that state landfill investigators are also looking 
into the cause of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the blaze and no nearby residents were evacuated because 
the nearest homes are about 2 miles west of the landfill, which was closed all 
day, he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Regional Water Quality Control Board on Monday gave officials of the 
Encina sewage treatment plant in Carlsbad until March, 1990, to correct high 
levels of toxics detected in the sewage plant's effluent. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted to issue the cease-and-desist order against the North County 
plant after hearing a report that the Encina facility had exceeded its toxicity 
levels in six of the seven months between June and December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, board members praised Encina officials for acting quickly by hiring an 
outside consultant to find the cause of the problem. Encina officials have said 
that, although the toxics exceed state limits, the effluent does not pose a 
threat to public health or the environment.

Police are seeking leads in the shooting death of a 32-year-old Lemon Grove man 
late Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Lee Chirrick of the 1800 block of Eldora Street was shot at 11:10 p.m. 
while apparently sitting on his motorcycle in the parking lot of a 
check-cashing business in the 300 block of El Cajon Boulevard, Detective Robert 
Lein said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation revealed that the shots could have come from a 
handgun, Lein said. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man, who heard the gunfire and called police, found the wounded 
Chirrick lying next to the motorcycle, Lein said. 
</P>
<P>
Chirrick died at the scene.

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police said Monday that they have located a man wanted for 
questioning in the brutal beating of a 13-year-old Hillcrest girl last month. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Leon Brown, 27, was arrested Thursday in Long Beach and is being held 
there on suspicion of burglary and auto theft, police spokesman Bill Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, whom the girl's family befriended, had been sought for questioning in 
the beating of Marcie Bradburn, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was found Jan. 27, unconscious near the site of the abandoned Sears 
store at Cleveland and University avenues. She suffered severe head and back 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Brown was a guest in the family's apartment in the 1400 block of 
Morrow Way, less than two blocks from where the girl was found, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl has been undergoing therapy at Vista Hill Hospital, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is on parole from Chino State Prison for a burglary conviction, will 
also face a charge of violating his parole, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Police Detective Bruce Kertson interviewed Brown and is forwarding 
the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, police said.

LAND COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert J. Samuelson's column "Staggering Land Prices Make the Japanese Economy 
Less Than a Miracle at Home" (Op-Ed Page, Feb.13) highlights the relevancy of 
his assertions to California. It notes that prices of single family homes 
within 45 minutes commuting distance of downtown Tokyo are about $500,000. 
However, there are increasingly large portions of Los Angeles where $500,000 is 
insufficient to buy any kind of a home. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelson refers to the fact that in 1988 land prices jumped 28% in Japan. But, 
in the last 25 years, even greater increases have occurred in Southern 
California. Samuelson notes that Japanese real estate taxes are low, making it 
easier for owners to hold on to their land, while profits are taxed heavily if 
they sell. He suggests that real estate taxes be raised and taxes on land sale 
profits be lowered to bring about affordable housing. But in California, taxes 
on real estate have been negligible since Prop. 13, while sellers not only have 
to pay substantial gains taxes, but are re-assessed at a much higher scale when 
they purchase replacement properties. 
</P>
<P>
But higher taxes on buildings and other improvements will only further diminish 
the amount of available housing. To encourage a supply of affordable homes, 
only land taxes should be increased. Doing so would cause the price to drop and 
make land near the metropolitan core acquirable at a reasonable price, thus 
discouraging speculators from holding land out of use, preventing urban sprawl, 
and encouraging proper development of land generally.

DRUG SMUGGLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If this country truly is seeking a lasting solution to its currently 
uncontrollable drug problem, it would behoove our "powers that be" to adopt the 
method used by Iran ("Iran Hangs 70 for Drug Smuggling," Part I, Feb. 15). 
There certainly are no repeat offenders; future prospects would surely think 
twice, lest they be caught; and quite possibly our youth would lean more 
positively towards education and not street gangs, if the pushers couldn't lure 
them into selling. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the penalty is severe. Maybe it's time to review our "protective" laws and 
get tough in action, not just dialogue.

As a former Belgian, I read with interest, your article "Brussels -- A Capital

that "Belgians are not very patriotic." It is true that Belgians are not 
chauvinistic, a very different notion. 
</P>
<P>
The Belgian people have amply demonstrated their patriotism by resisting 
invasion and occupation during two world wars.

JURY AWARD IN CHRISTIAN CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The award of $21.75 million to Hudson's lover for his "emotional distress" 
makes a laughing stock of justice in this country, and opens a veritable 
Pandora's box. 
</P>
<P>
Unless this verdict is eventually reversed, one can foresee an army of 
"ambulance chasers" entering the scene. Every living or recently deceased AIDS 
victim who had some wealth will now be a possible legal target by any of his 
previous sex partners, even if they did not in fact contact the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the assessment of damages should not be done by juries, but by a 
committee of realistic professional experts.

THE MISSING GUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The extraordinary lengths gone to by Chinese officials to prevent noted 
dissident Fang Lizhi from attending President Bush's dinner in Beijing over the 
weekend is a sign of how extremely sensitive the leadership has become to calls 
for greater political liberalization and freer speech in China. And the passive 
if not craven complaisance shown by high U.S. officials in the face of this 
affront to the President says much about the caution that the United States has 
chosen to exercise when dealing with human-rights abuses in China. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, an astrophysicist who was booted out of the Communist Party two years ago 
for demanding more democracy, was one of several dissidents invited by the 
United States to attend the dinner along with hundreds of officials. Chinese 
authorities allowed at least two of these government critics into the hotel 
banquet hall. Fang, however, was waylaid by police and delayed for hours until 
the dinner had ended. Afterward, American officials professed to be "unaware" 
that he hadn't been at the banquet. That is an incredible statement. 
</P>
<P>
Consider. China's most prominent dissident is invited to be a dinner guest of 
the President of the United States. It is no secret that this action displeases 
the Beijing regime, nor could it have gone unsuspected that efforts would be 
made to bar Fang's way. Yet the U.S. Embassy didn't bother to send a car or 
escort to see that Fang would safely reach the banquet hall. Nor, if the story 
is to be believed, did any American even note Fang's absence or try to inquire 
where he might be. Only later, after Fang described to American reporters how 
he had been kept away, did U.S. officials express disappointment over what 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
One irony in all this is that Bush didn't even have human rights on his agenda 
when he met with Chinese leaders. Instead it was the Chinese side that brought 
the subject up so that it could talk tough about how both Chinese and American 
advocates of democracy for China are threatening the country's stability and 
the course of Sino-American relations. Clearly the Chinese are disturbed by the 
increasing outspokenness of Fang and other pro-democracy forces. Clearly they 
are angered by private American encouragement of this movement, enough so that 
they didn't hesitate to offend the President. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, the man who didn't come to dinner, continues to speak out with admirable 
courage. It is his embarrassed American would-be hosts who have had far too 
little to say.

SUCH PRIVATE PAIN, SO LITTLE PUBLIC CARE 
</P>

I was shocked and saddened to read last week about the stabbing death of social 
worker Robbyn Panitch in Santa Monica. And then I saw the picture on Page 3: 
David Scott Smith was the man who had sat next to me in church the previous 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
My boyfriend Tad had just gotten up to help out with the collection -- this was 
the week the money would be used to help the homeless who live in the park 
across the street. A man I recognized as one of our "park people" slipped into 
the empty space beside me. His smell was unpleasant, but not overpowering. I 
mentioned that the seat was taken and that my boyfriend would return soon. The 
man didn't move. 
</P>
<P>
We use a lot of music in our 5:30 Mass and it's not unusual to find people 
crying quietly during the service over some private pain. The man from the park 
sitting next to me began to sob, tears streaming down his face. He began 
calling: "Yahweh, heal me! I am in so much pain!" I had no tissues in my purse 
to offer, but I did reach out a hand of comfort to rest on his shoulder. He 
didn't acknowledge me or my feeble gesture. Instead, he began to call out: "God 
I love you so much." Then he shouted an obscenity. And that's when I knew we 
had a problem. 
</P>
<P>
When my boyfriend returned, the man I later recognized as David Scott Smith 
seemed to calm down. He appeared to be genuinely grateful when several people 
reached out a hand to him during the part of the Mass when everyone extends a 
sign of peace. He took Communion. Afterward, as my boyfriend bent his head down 
for a moment of quiet reflection, this man who'd been ranting just a few 
minutes earlier extended a hand of his own and placed it on Tad's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, he stabbed his social worker to death. 
</P>
<P>
The incident affected me not only because I had had some personal interaction 
with the man, but also because my job takes me out on the streets where I talk 
to people like David Scott Smith every day. I talk to their social workers who 
complain about their ever-increasing caseloads. And I talk to the people who 
operate the clinics, who say that they find themselves treating the David Scott 
Smiths only in the latter stages of their diseases because there isn't enough 
manpower to treat them any earlier. And I talk to the Los Angeles County 
supervisors, who tell me that the state isn't living up to its agreement to pay 
90% of the mental health bill, and that the county doesn't have enough money to 
pick up an $18-million deficit. And I talk to the people who work with the 
homeless, who tell me that fully a thirdof the people who live on our streets 
are mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Those who saw David Scott Smith more often than I knew that he was 
deteriorating mentally. His mother tried to have him committed after he tried 
to strangle her, but David was unwilling to enter a hospital. The only other 
way to have someone institutionalized is to prove that he poses a threat to 
himself or to others. But a woman who works with the homeless mentally ill told 
me a joke among mental health professionals: The only way to prove that the 
threat exists is if someone attacks a psychiatrist in the presence of another 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the county began dismantling services at 13 clinics from the San 
Fernando Valley to San Pedro. Eventually, nearly 500 mental health workers will 
be laid off, demoted or transferred to other jobs. Robbyn Panitch was one of 
those scheduled for demotion. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty thousand patients will lose their counselors. Another 10,000 could find 
themselves transferring buses as many as three times in order to get counseling 
and medication at one of the few remaining open clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The closures have not come without protest. Psychiatrists and parents of the 
mentally ill staged loud and colorful rallies throughout Los Angeles County. 
Patients stood nervously at microphones, telling in painful detail what their 
lives were like before they found counseling. Groups marched on Sacramento. But 
unless the supervisors act quickly, the clinics will close. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health has not been a top priority for county budget planners. That's 
largely because most of the money to run the clinics is supposed to come from 
the state. But for more than a decade, that hasn't happened. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors must take a more active stand in the fight for state funding. A 
united board should demand that the governor invoke the dreaded "T" word to pay 
for mental health care and half a dozen other health crises in the making. If a 
general increase in state income tax proves too distasteful for the 
politicians, alternative "user fees" could be found. Such tax increases are not 
unpopular with Californians. Voters approved an increase in cigarette taxes 
last November to offset some of the costs of treating poor patients. And recent 
polls indicate that drivers would pay an extra five cents a gallon in order to 
reduce traffic woes. Wouldn't they agree to a tiny increase in the state's 
sales tax in order to pay for adequate mental health care? 
</P>
<P>
It's time to realize that the system of caring for the mentally ill is falling 
apart. You don't have to look very far to see for yourself. Walk the streets of 
downtown Los Angeles. Take a stroll beneath Santa Monica Pier. Or come to 
church with me next Sunday.

MANDATORY PRO BONO WORK IS NOT THE ROUTE TO JUSTICE FOR INDIGENTS IN CIVIL 
CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD F. UELMEN, Gerald F. Uelmen is dean of the Santa Clara University 
School of Law.

<TEXT>
<P>
The unmet need for volunteers to represent indigent clients in civil cases is 
growing at a faster rate than the glut of lawyers graduating from American law 
schools. Is the solution then to compel lawyers to accept court-appointed 
clients without compensation? The U.S. Supreme Court will tackle this question 
today when a young Iowa lawyer argues his first case before the high court. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Mallard practices business law in Fairfield, Iowa. In June of 1987, he 
was appointed by the U.S. District Court to represent three inmates at the Iowa 
State Penitentiary who had filed a civil rights suit against prison 
administrators. The suit claims that the prison officials endangered the 
inmates by exposing their role as informants. Mallard, citing his lack of 
litigation experience, asked to withdraw from the case. The court refused to 
let him off the hook, and Mallard ultimately petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court 
to review the pro bono, or no fee, appointment. When a hearing was granted, bar 
associations lined up on both sides of the case to file "friend of the court" 
briefs. Bar groups that support mandatory pro bono requirements for lawyers, 
such as the Bar of the City of New York, are opposing Mallard. The State Bar of 
California is supporting him. 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult issue in Mallard's case is posed by the claim that federal 
courts have "inherent authority" to order lawyers to accept cases. This claim 
is supported by historical precedent for criminal cases. For many years, before 
public defender offices were established, courts would simply appoint whatever 
lawyer happened to be in the courtroom that day to represent an indigent 
defendant. Often forgotten, however, is the sordid doubled standard of justice 
that prevailed under this system. Appointed lawyers frequently sought the 
earliest opportunity to plead their clients guilty. Also overlooked is the fact 
that a century ago, most lawyers went to court, and the burden of taking 
appointed cases could be spread among the entire bar. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the vast majority of lawyers seldom see the inside of a courtroom. 
Limiting appointments to those who are litigators means that the burden of pro 
bono representation falls on relatively few shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the assertion of judicial authority to mandate acceptance of 
court-appointed clients may undermine the voluntary programs now in place. The 
thousands of lawyers who participate as volunteers maintain control over their 
caseloads. As long as they are free to reject a case that may be too burdensome 
or costly, or demand competence in unfamiliar terrain, they remain willing to 
accept their fair share. Once the courts begin mandating the acceptance of pro 
bono clients, then few lawyers will volunteer to take cases not meeting that 
mandatory obligation. A process of displacement could occur, in which only the 
needs of indigents whose claim for counsel has been recognized by the courts 
would be met. Others equally deserving would be left unserved. 
</P>
<P>
No one seriously suggests that the health needs of indigents should be met by 
compelling doctors to accept indigent patients. Providing a minimal level of 
health care is perceived as a public responsibility, not just a responsibility 
of the medical profession. Yet, for eight years, funding for legal services for 
indigents has been mercilessly cut, and the clients turned away are left to 
seek handouts from volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Giving courts the power to compel acceptance of clients in civil cases is 
likely to accelerate the process of public funding cutbacks and 
institutionalize a double standard of justice. One class of justice would be 
reserved for paying clients, while appointed clients would receive the kind of 
justice that indigent, criminal defendants received a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
As Meyer Goldman, a founder of the public defender movement, put it: "Too 
frequently, the services (of appointed lawyers), if rewarded by small fees, are 
half-hearted or openly negligible . . . The client pays the penalty, perhaps 
not for the crime charged, but often for his poverty." The public defender 
system has worked well in providing competent representation for indigent 
defendants in criminal cases. Publicly funded legal-aid clinics come closer to 
our ideal of "equal justice for all" than a system of judicially mandated 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, some lawyers are shirkers. A recent poll commissioned by the American 
Bar Assn. reported that only one out of five American lawyers volunteer to 
handle pro bono civil cases. But today's level of specialization simply means 
that many lack the competence to handle the kinds of cases where indigents need 
representation. Many such lawyers contribute to their communities in other 
ways. In arguing his own case before the Supreme Court, Mallard faces a 
paradox. The more brilliant his advocacy, the less compelling will be his claim 
that he lacks competence in litigation skills. But more than the personal 
competence of John E. Mallard is at issue in the case of Mallard vs. U.S. 
District Court.

TAKING ON GOP'S UNWANTED WIZARD; 
</P>
<P>
PARTY'S MINORITIES CAN EXPLOIT WHAT KLANSMAN SYMBOLIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I always figured that David Duke would make something of himself. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't easy. Duke, a former member of the American Nazi Party and the Ku 
Klux Klan, was elected this month to the Louisiana Legislature as a member of 
the Republican Party. But he had to overcome a Republican opponent endorsed by 
some GOP heavyweights -- including President Bush and former President Reagan 
-- to do it. That's because Republican leaders are worried that Duke, who has 
recently been running something called the National Assn. for the Advancement 
of White People, will taint the GOP with his racist politics. In fact, 
Republican Chairman Lee Atwater was quick to repudiate Duke after his victory, 
and convinced the party's executive committee to "expell" him by barring Duke 
from receiving financial or any other kind of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
But while Duke insists on calling himself a Republican, the GOP is stuck with 
the former klansman. They will not find him easy to live with. Despite his 
loony-sounding affiliations, Duke is not your typical political-fringe dingbat. 
He's handsome, glib and knows how to use the media to his advantage. 
</P>
<P>
I found that out in 1977, when Duke first got widespread public attention 
outside of Louisiana. Duke then billed himself as executive director and grand 
dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, always being careful to explain that 
it was one of several Klan groups in the country. I was covering Mexican border 
issues for The Times, and ran across Duke when the 27-year-old racist hit on 
the idea of a Klan "border watch." 
</P>
<P>
Duke had concluded that illegal immigrants from Mexico had joined blacks, Jews 
and the other assorted Klan bogymen as threats to white people in the United 
States. So he announced that Klan members would begin patrolling the border to 
help the U.S. Border Patrol catch illegal aliens. Despite the fact the Border 
Patrol said it neither wanted nor needed help from the Klan -- indeed, most 
agents I knew either laughed at the stunt or were offended by it -- many of my 
colleagues in the news media swallowed Duke's self-promotion hook, line and 
sinker. 
</P>
<P>
That happened on a sadly comic night in late October -- a few days before 
Halloween, fittingly enough -- when Duke rendezvoused with newsmen in rural San 
Diego County, just north of the small Mexican town of Tecate. He and seven 
other men showed up in three old sedans that had hand-painted "Klan Border 
Watch" signs taped on their doors. About 40 newsmen, their TV camera lights 
setting the dark night ablaze, descended on them to dutifully record Duke's 
claims that hundreds of other Klansmen were out that very night, riding their 
cars along the border and communicating over citizens-band radios, to stem the 
"brown tide" threatening white America. 
</P>
<P>
He was lying, of course. I spent most of that night monitoring all CB channels 
and heard nothing except Duke talking to his friends in the two other cars. I 
reported that. Officers with the Border Patrol and San Diego Sheriff's 
Department told me there were more reporters and cameramen in the area that 
night than either Klansmen or illegal aliens. I reported that, too. But not 
enough of my colleagues did. 
</P>
<P>
It got even worse when I happened to run across Duke in Texas a few days later. 
He was returning to Louisiana from California and his plane stopped in San 
Antonio. I was there on another assignment, but dropped in on the airport press 
conference he held. There he repeated the same cockamamie story he told in 
California, and I was more than a little ashamed at how easily the local 
reporters accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
We in the news media did not do ourselves proud in dealing with Duke in 1977. 
By taking him even halfway seriously, we gave him the publicity he wanted. We 
also stirred up anxiety among Chicano activists, and many became agitated at 
the thought of Latinos being threatened by the Klan. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations that Latinos held against the Klan back then played into 
Duke's hands, too, by increasing his notoriety. But as I ponder his recent 
success, I think there's a way that Latinos can use Duke to their advantage 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he became GOP chairman, Atwater has been saying all the right things 
about opening the party to more blacks, Latinos and other minorities. But GOP 
leaders have been saying such things for years and not always acting on them. 
In fact, the first Republican to make a special effort to reach Latino voters 
was Richard Nix-on, the guy who first used the "Southern strategy" -- looking 
for votes among Southern whites unhappy with the Democratic Party's support for 
civil rights -- to get himself elected. Duke's victory is the logical extreme 
of Nixon's cynical politics. But maybe with an embarrassment like Duke now 
sitting on their right flank, Republicans like Atwater will be more inclined to 
act on their good impulses as well as talk about them. It behooves Latino 
Republicans to put them to the test. 
</P>
<P>
Duke is somebody else's problem now, but his reemergence has created an 
opportunity for minorities in the Republican Party. They must exploit what Duke 
symbolizes -- the same way he has eagerly exploited what minorities symbolize 
to many misguided people.

CABLE TV FIRM EXPECTS TO MISS DEADLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A United Cable Television official predicted Monday that his company would not 
meet a deadline of midnight tonight for activating all of the long-awaited East 
San Fernando Valley cable TV system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be very close," said United attorney Scott Adler. But he said 
the company probably cannot meet the city-imposed deadline for the entire 
870-mile system. 
</P>
<P>
United, calling in crews from as far as Denver, has activated 99% of the 
system, Adler said. Activation is adding power to cable so it is capable of 
providing service to homes. 
</P>
<P>
United won the franchise in 1983 on the promise that it would complete the 
system by December, 1985. In June, the City Council granted the company an 
unprecedented fourth extension until today to activate the system. United faces 
$186,500 in fines if it fails to meet the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
United -- already fined $271,000 in recent years for failing to meet city 
deadlines -- contends that past delays have been beyond the company's control. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Herman, general manager of the city Department of Telecommunications, 
which regulates cable in the city, did not know the status of the East Valley 
system on Monday but said she will send an inspector out Wednesday to see if 
United has met the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Adler argued that the company is "substantially in compliance" with the 
completion schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Schippers, United's director of operations, refused to speculate on how 
soon service would be available to all residents. United has nearly 46,000 
customers. Portions of Studio City, Toluca Lake and Universal City still lack 
service. 
</P>
<P>
United's franchise area takes in the Valley east of the San Diego Freeway and 
north of Ventura Boulevard, except for portions of Sylmar, Sunland-Tujunga and 
Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We are as anxious to complete the system as residents are to get cable," 
Schippers said. "It only makes good business sense. We've made an enormous 
investment in this cable system. We're not going to sit by and watch that 
investment sit idle."

REFLECTIONS: I'VE COMBINED BOTH MY MUSIC AND ART TOGETHER INTO ONE BIG BALL OF 
WAX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERRY C. RIDDLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he retired in 1976, Ben Bronson found a way to combine his talents in art 
and music for a new career. His distinctive sculptures have been displayed at 
galleries, and one bronze is on permanent display at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion. Bronson, 75, and his wife, Trudy, live in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
I grew up in Green Point, Lower East Side of New York City, a rather rough 
neighborhood. Every Jewish mother wanted to have her own Mischa Elman, one of 
the great violinists of the time, or a doctor. My mother chose a musician, so I 
started to play the violin. It kept me off the streets. There were a lot of 
gangs in Green Point. I played until I was 13 and was quite good. 
</P>
<P>
At 9, I started to draw seriously. I saved up 75 cents and built myself a 
little oil painting set, but when I got back to the house, I discovered I 
didn't have any canvas to paint on. So, like a brilliant kid, I went into the 
bedroom of our three-room apartment and cut a square piece out of a window 
shade. Then I rolled the shade back up. All hell broke loose because I wouldn't 
say that I did it. I blamed the cat because I knew my father hated cats. He 
didn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
I knew I was going to go into art or music. I loved music, and I met some 
wonderful people. We had a quartet, and we got a program on WOR in New York. We 
weren't paid, but we had a lot of fun doing it. In high school, I got a 
scholarship with the New York Philharmonic, but I didn't take it. We were in 
the midst of the Depression, and career musicians weren't making money, so I 
decided I could make more money in commercial art. 
</P>
<P>
But all of the things that I learned with the violin came in handy. On 
weekends, I would play at weddings or parties, and I'd make myself $10 or $15. 
I'd probably make more than my dad did working all week. He was a house painter 
and a tinsmith. So I was able to study art and still make money with the 
fiddle. 
</P>
<P>
I lived about 30 years in Brooklyn and then decided to come out to California. 
</P>
<P>
I retired as a commercial artist and graphic designer in 1976. I was 63 at the 
time. I quit for about a week or so and then went into a second career. And 
I've been at it now almost 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
I had dabbled in sculpture, so I said to myself, "Let's assume that you're 
going to be a sculptor, what will you make? Every sculptor makes heads or 
torsos, what will you do?" I decided I'd try hands. To me, hands talk. They 
tell me a lot about the character of a person. 
</P>
<P>
The first one was the hands of a conductor. The next piece I did was two hands 
holding a clarinet. So I've combined both my music and art together into one 
big ball of wax, which is a wonderful thing for me. 
</P>
<P>
After the first three, I realized I can do hands. They're not as difficult as I 
was led to believe. When I sold one, I decided that I had myself a business. 
Since then I've been sculpting and selling them. But you can't make a living at 
it. If you're retired and you sell something, then it's OK. 
</P>
<P>
From the bronze I decided I'd try some wood. Then I spent three weeks in 
Carrara, Italy, two years ago, working in marble. It was a most congenial and 
delightful experience, the best that I've ever had. I wish I had it when I was 
younger. Working in marble is very hard. Especially at 73. 
</P>
<P>
I've been successful at each one of these. I've done steel, aluminum, bronze, 
wood, clay, alabaster. Each one of these is a challenge. And I love the 
challenge, and I love working on new things. 
</P>
<P>
I'd say these are the best years of my life. It's been a a most wonderful 
experience. I look forward to getting up in the morning, going out to work in 
my little studio that I built in the back yard. It's 5 by 8 feet, but 
everything is at my fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
I had a lifetime of bosses. When I worked for someone, I had one boss. But when 
I was working on my own, every account became a boss. They put on little 
pointed hats, and they said, "I don't like this, I don't like that." When I 
retired, I was free. Since then, I have refused to take any commissions so that 
no one tells me what to do. I'm doing what I want to do, and that's it.

STUDIO CITY MAN CHARGED IN GRANDFATHER'S '83 MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and BARBARA KOH, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Studio City man will appear in court Thursday on charges that he murdered his 
grandfather five years ago, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Noel P. Scott, 27, was charged with Oct. 16, 1983, murder of Louis Fox, 70, of 
Studio City after Los Angeles police reopened their investigation based on 
information from a former friend who said Scott admitted he was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, who has pleaded not guilty, is free on $50,000 bail and lives in the 
house where his grandfather was killed, officials said. A date for Scott's 
preliminary hearing is to be scheduled during his court appearance Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Fox was beaten and shot to death during a robbery at the home in the 12700 
block of Milbank Street. Police said Scott was a suspect from the start but 
detectives did not have enough evidence for an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Based on statements from a burglary suspect who had once been Scott's friend, 
detectives reopened the case in October, 1988, and arrested Scott in November. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Charles Berkowitz, 26, said Scott told him two days after the 
killing that he was responsible, police said. The investigation also turned up 
other new evidence, said Detective Mike Coffee, who declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz was interviewed by police shortly after Fox's murder. Berkowitz told 
investigators he knew Scott hated his grandfather because he was cheap and had 
changed his mind about a promise to pay for Scott's college education, police 
reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz also said Scott told him before the murder that he would like to 
burglarize his grandfather's house and that the older man had $20,000 worth of 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz did not tell police of the alleged confession until he contacted 
homicide detectives in October, 1988, after his arrest for a residential 
burglary. Berkowitz informed police that Scott told him about the murder two 
days after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz told police that Scott said, "I ripped off my grandfather and had a 
little problem." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said it was unclear why Berkowitz told police about the alleged 
confession. They said he received no deal or favorable treatment in exchange 
for his statements. He pleaded guilty to burglary and attempted burglary in 
January and was sentenced to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports, Scott became a suspect because of his manner 
during questioning, along with other evidence and witnesses' statements. Fox 
owned an attack dog that was unharmed during the killing, leading investigators 
to believe that the killer was someone the dog was familiar with, according to 
the reports. 
</P>
<P>
During the robbery and murder, Fox's jewelry was stolen from a hiding place in 
a drawer but there was no evidence the room had been searched, indicating that 
the killer already knew where the jewelry was kept.

PIT BULL ENTERS HOME, MAULS DOG, IS SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pit bull that wandered into a West Hills home mauled a German shepherd and 
charged a police officer before being shot to death, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred at 6 p.m. Sunday in the 24400 block of Deer Lick Drive, 
said Lt. Don Kitchen of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, who was not identified, called police when the pit bull entered her 
house through an open door. When Officer John Futrell and Sgt. Bob Rebhan 
arrived, the dog ran from the house and charged at Futrell. Before the dog 
could attack the officer, Rebhan shot it to death with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen said police believe the dog was wild and lived in the hills behind the 
Deer Lick Drive neighborhood. He said the German shepherd was in critical 
condition at an animal hospital.

SPARKS TRANSFERS TO MONTCLAIR PREP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Derek Sparks, considered one the top sophomore football players in 
the state, has transferred from Banning High in Wilmington to Montclair Prep in 
Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks (6-1, 200 pounds) was an All-City Section running back at Banning last 
fall. He rushed for 1,394 yards and scored 15 touchdowns to help the Pilots 
reach the City 4-A Division championship game. He enrolled at Montclair Prep at 
the start of the spring semester two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Sparks, Derek's uncle and legal guardian, cited the fear of gang 
activity in Wilmington and the rigorous academic environment at Montclair Prep 
for changing schools. Montclair Prep more closely resembles the schools Derek 
attended in Texas before he transferred to Banning last fall, Jerome said. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking on the (Montclair Prep) campus gave me a feeling of Texas," Jerome 
Sparks said. "The way the school is, you get that country feeling. It's not 
closed in and chained up. . . . I felt Derek needed to be in a different 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Derek's mother, June, who lives in Wharton, Tex., grew concerned for her son's 
safety at Banning because of reported shootings in the Wilmington area, 
according to Jerome. He added that a shooting occurred in the Harbor College 
parking lot after a game with Washington High last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to keep the boy in an area where there are gangs," Jerome said. 
"His mother wasn't comfortable with that. She wanted to bring him home (to 
Texas), but we couldn't let her do that after what he did last season." 
</P>
<P>
Derek Sparks lived with his uncle in a Wilmington apartment while he attended 
Banning. Jerome Sparks said he gave up the apartment Feb. 3, three days before 
the start of the spring semester. They are now living in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Sparks had transferred spread at Banning last week. But school 
officials, including football Coach Joe Dominguez, said they were not informed 
by any member of the Sparks family. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was best that we made a decision without any type of persuasion," 
Jerome Sparks said. "We didn't want to get in some recruiting game with 
Banning." 
</P>
<P>
Some might consider the transfer strange. Banning, along with Carson, stands at 
the pinnacle of City football. The Pilots have won eight 4-A titles since 1976, 
including six in a row from 1976 to '81. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep, a small private school, competes at Division IX -- the lowest 
level in the Southern Section. The Mounties were 6-5 and lost in the first 
round of the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
But Montclair Prep has established a strong athletic tradition and includes 
among its alumni such football players as running back Rich Swinton and wide 
receiver Tim Stallworth of Washington State, former Stanford football and 
baseball standout Toi Cook and Reggie Smith Jr., son of the former Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
The family wanted Derek to attend a school that stresses academics and 
Montclair Prep fills the bill. Derek was an honor student from seventh to ninth 
grade.

SURFING MAGAZINE; 
</P>
<P>
CATCHES LONG WAVE; 
</P>
<P>
KEPT AFLOAT BY APPAREL ADS, THE JOURNAL MARKS ITS 25TH YEAR. AS IT GETS OLDER, 
ITS READERSHIP GROWS YOUNGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You'd think that after 25 years in the Southern California sunshine, Surfing 
magazine would be all dried up. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it's changed. It started in the early 1960s with breathless stories about 
surfing awards banquets, progressed to spiritualistic stream of consciousness 
in the '70s and turned to adolescence in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Bikinis and boards are smaller, readers are younger and the photography is 
glossier. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is in the abundant advertising 
and its focus on the billion dollar surfwear industry. 
</P>
<P>
When the magazine started out, very few ads broke up the big blue waves on the 
magazine's pages; but as Surfing celebrates its 25th anniversary, the magazine 
flourishes with a lot of help from an industry that it helped to create -- 
beachwear. Today, surf publishing and apparel would drown if they had to paddle 
out into the business world separately. 
</P>
<P>
"Without them (surf magazines), we can't reach the consumer," said Jerry 
Crosby, executive vice president of marketing for Ocean Pacific Sunwear. 
"Without us (manufacturers), they may not be around. It is an informal 
co-dependency that we find ourselves in." 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente magazine, founded by two surfers, marks its Silver Anniversary 
with a paid circulation of 114,000 in 50 states and 35 foreign countries -- 
more than five times its initial output in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of other differences exist, too. The magazine started out as International 
Surfing with only 68 pages. The "international" was dropped in 1968, and today 
Surfing averages 175 pages per month, said Editor David Gilovich. 
</P>
<P>
Each issue generally sports more ad pages than the first issue had in total 
pages, and Surfing has apparel manufacturers to thank for that. While early 
issues boasted mostly surfboard ads, today beachwear advertising accounts for 
nearly 50% of Surfing's $3.25 million in ad revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Surfing prints an annual "summer fashion preview," stuffed with 
clothing brands such as Bad Dog, Billabong and Body Glove. The 1988 fashion 
issue ran 220 pages, a magazine that Publisher Bob Mignogna contends was "the 
largest issue of a surf magazine in history." 
</P>
<P>
"In our first 15 years of publishing, the surfing industry in terms of dollars 
was very small," said Mignogna, who's been with Surfing for 15 years. "It 
started out as a cottage industry. Until about 1975, all the major companies 
were surfboard manufacturers." 
</P>
<P>
Today, between 300 and 400 apparel makers specialize in surf-flavored fashions, 
of which about 70 are in Orange County, the U.S. hub of surf manufacturing and 
publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Bonhall, editor of Action Sports Retailer in South Laguna, estimates that 
$1.5 billion is spent in the United States each year on beachwear alone. And he 
says that few manufacturers can afford not to advertise in both Surfing and 
Surfer, a San Juan Capistrano competitor founded in 1960 that has a monthly 
paid circulation of 112,000. 
</P>
<P>
The circulation figures for Surfing and Surfer are healthy for a specialty 
publication, according to Bilal Said, a publishing industry analyst for S. G. 
Warburg &amp; Co. in New York. And what's more important, he says, is that an 
ad in Surfer or Surfing gets straight to the consumer core that apparel 
manufacturers want to reach. 
</P>
<P>
For while beachwear has appeal beyond the million or so U.S. surfers, Mignogna 
says, "the basic premise is that your product has to be worn by authentic 
surfers if it is going to be considered on the cutting edge." 
</P>
<P>
While the two magazines are equally important to manufacturers, they have 
vastly different images. 
</P>
<P>
Surfer is "the Bible" of surf publications, said Danny Kwock, marketing 
director for Quiksilver Inc. of Costa Mesa. "Surfing is the avant-garde, the 
hip, rock 'n' roll, on-the-edge publication." 
</P>
<P>
Who reads Surfing? Well, here's a clue from one letter-to-the-editor out of La 
Jolla: 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the reason I am writing this letter is to let everyone know just what I 
think about life," writes Aaron Klein in Surfing's February edition. "Granted, 
at 17 years old, I may not know everything but I have been surfing for 10 of 
those years so I think I know something about the life style." 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to catalogue what's hot and what's not in his own wet world. Hot: 
Surfing, skateboarding, snow boarding, jet skiing, bikini contests. Not: 
Offshore oil rigs, nuclear war, President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Like Klein, the magazine's average reader falls within a very small sub-group 
of the world's population: He's a male, somewhere between 16 and 18 years old. 
He lives in a beach town, is just finishing up high school or barely entering 
college. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what makes Surfing so valuable to the manufacturer of surf clothes, 
says Ocean Pacific's Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
"Our target audience is 12 to 24," Crosby says. "Surfing has less wasted 
distribution for us. Most people in our industry have a similar target audience 
if they really thought about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Younger Readers 
</P>
<P>
But Surfing's reader wasn't always quite so young. When the magazine started 
demographic studies in 1976, it found its readers were 20 to 21 years old. For 
the next 10 years, Mignogna said, the readers got progressively younger, with 
more sporting orthodontia than using razors. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the older readers surfed off into the sunset. There's just been a 
"huge increase" in the number of younger readers, says Gilovich. As a result, 
the magazine has pitched its pages a peg lower. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, for example, the magazine published a paean to Duke Kahanamoku, the 
father of modern day surfing who is credited with introducing the sport to 
California and Australia. Kahanamoku, the magazine gushed, "has done more for 
Hawaii than all the hula girls and Hawaiian Visitors Bureau posters combined." 
</P>
<P>
Fast-forward to 1973, when stream-of-consciousness hit the pages: "There aren't 
any new surfers, the new faces are faceless, as you are paddling out again for 
your second wave, moving never fast enough against the lateral current along 
the white edge of the turned-over water scar, watching out to where the walls 
first show." 
</P>
<P>
And what does 1989 look like in comparison? The ads sport fresh-faced, tanned 
boys and girls. In the February issue, a feature called "Star Boards" asks 
champion surfers -- most very recent drivers -- about their favorite equipment. 
And "Getting a New Board Wired" tells board buyers to go slowly at first: 
</P>
<P>
"When you get a new board," the advice column cautions, "you're pumped and you 
expect it to go unreal. But if you take off on your first wave and try to pull 
15 off-the-lips, you're likely to get bummed out when you suddenly discover you 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Approaches 
</P>
<P>
The competition, however, is not willing to concede the younger reader. Nor 
does Surfer magazine give Surfing much credit for, well, much of anything. 
Peter Holmes, Surfer's editor in chief, calls his magazine "a little more 
profound, in depth." 
</P>
<P>
"They (Surfing) tend toward the personality and making of stars, if you like," 
Holmes contends. "We're more concerned with the experience of surfing and so 
regard all surfers as equals in the water." 
</P>
<P>
But profundity does not ensure advertising. While Surfing boasted advertising 
revenue of $3.25 million in 1988, Surfer lagged a bit behind, with ad revenue 
of $3 million, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Western Empire Publications became Surfing's fourth owner in 1979, Mignogna 
said. After 3 break-even years, the magazine and its parent company, which also 
publishes Body Boarding, have both been profitable. 
</P>
<P>
So the magazine is saying thank you to all those surfers who made it possible 
with three anniversary editions that dive to the heart of the surfing 
experience. "The Surfboard" has already floated by, but brace yourself for 
"Waves" in June and "Surfers" in November. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed among those special editions are regular features such as the 
summer swimsuit preview, an all-Hawaii issue and the annual pro surfing U.S.A. 
edition.

2 COMPANIES REALIZE RETURNS ON TAX SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOT KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cassandra Sylvester, a taxpayer services specialist in the Internal Revenue 
Service's Houston office, answers only the hard questions. Her forte is the 
most confusing, complicated and baffling problems taxpayers may have. She 
sometimes spends an entire day poring over obscure IRS rulings to clarify a 
single clause of tax law. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the queries concern a specific IRS form or a set of instructions, or 
when taxpayers ask her to calculate a set of numbers, her job is easier. 
Sylvester simply loads a copy of Turbo Tax, an income tax preparation software 
program published by San Diego-based ChipSoft Inc., into her personal computer 
and responds immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"The program replaces Package X, Volume 1," she said, lapsing into IRS jargon 
for the standard package of forms most taxpayers know about. "It is easier to 
go to the computer than do it the way we used to." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Emerged as Leader 
</P>
<P>
By making income tax preparation easier if not less painful, ChipSoft has 
emerged as the country's leading publisher of microcomputer-oriented tax 
preparation. Competing against marketing heavyweights such as Simon &amp; 
Schuster, ChipSoft holds nearly 50% of the retail market for this category, 
according to IMS America, a market research group near Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
ChipSoft is not the only publisher of tax preparation software in San Diego. 
According to IMS, La Jolla-based HowardSoft's Tax Preparer holds third place 
with 10% of the retail market. 
</P>
<P>
Although nobody appears to know exactly how much revenue income tax preparation 
software generates, the IMS figures -- which put the market through computer 
store sales at less than $2 million -- are unrealistically low. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell a lot of programs directly," said Jim Howard, president of HowardSoft. 
</P>
<P>
And, for much of the year, ChipSoft's Turbo Tax has topped the best-seller list 
of PC Connection (a large mail-order operation), outselling giants such as 
Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Revenue to Top $10 Million 
</P>
<P>
According to company President Mike Chipman, ChipSoft will sell 180,000 copies 
of its federal income tax program and another 60,000 state tax programs this 
year. Revenues should exceed $10 million in 1989, he said, adding that, 
including software for both personal users and professional tax preparers, the 
total market is about $60 million. Howard refused to reveal revenue figures, 
but said the company has 20,000 users. 
</P>
<P>
Both ChipSoft and HowardSoft were established by defense industry professionals 
who did their own taxes -- Howard, 46, holds a Ph.D. in electronics engineering 
and worked for 15 years at Hughes Aircraft in Los Angeles; Chipman, 42, was a 
programmer scientist at Scientific Applications International Corporation. The 
companies they founded, however, are quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Chipman was bitten early by the entrepreneurial bug. For Howard, "it was a 
fluke; a customer drove me into it." 
</P>
<P>
In late 1983, Chipman bought his first IBM PC and decided he wanted the 
computer to help him prepare his tax return. He was something of a tax nut, 
often reading forms he didn't even use in order to see what kind of deductions 
other people were getting. 
</P>
<P>
When he went software shopping, he didn't like what he found. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that everything was overpriced or underpowered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked at Night 
</P>
<P>
So he decided to write his own program. He wanted software that was fast and 
could handle what-if types of analysis for different tax scenarios. And, in the 
back of his mind, he knew that, if the program was good, he could use it to 
launch his own company. 
</P>
<P>
Chipman worked on the program at night for six months. In the summer of 1984, 
he quit his job, setting up shop in a room behind his garage. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, a teacher at Black Mountain Middle School in San Diego, couldn't 
understand why he gave up his job for one that had no chance of success, 
Chipman said. 
</P>
<P>
But, six weeks after his demonstration program to calculate the previous year's 
taxes was released, it received a rave review in a major PC magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to scrape me off the ceiling," Chipman recalled. "I was euphoric. It 
was a stroke of luck (the magazine) even had the program." 
</P>
<P>
Overnight, sales doubled to 1,000 units a month. Within nine months, the 
company was in the black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ah, the Entrepreneurial Life 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Chipman wrote a program with more power aimed at the 
professional tax preparer, which today costs $295. The program for personal 
users has a suggested retail price of $75. Annual updates are half price. 
</P>
<P>
Chipman began to live the fabled entrepreneurial life. He had a dozen employees 
working in his home. In the same room where he programmed, a woman 
shrink-wrapped boxes with a blow-dryer. The hallways were so stuffed with 
inventory that people had to walk sideways to pass. He and his wife worked 363 
days that year. 
</P>
<P>
Not until August, 1987, did they move to a 30,000-square-foot plant. Today the 
company has 85 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
ChipSoft's Turbo Tax success can be summed up by its patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"My life is so much faster and easier since I started using it," said John 
Starbuck, a licensed tax preparer in Vista for the past 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Starbuck prepares about 150 personal 1040 forms each tax season. He used to 
send his data to a computer service bureau in Los Angeles, which would then 
electronically calculate the return. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gives Me More Control' 
</P>
<P>
"But Turbo Tax gives me more control. And I have more free time with my motor 
home and sailboat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my taxes in one-third to one-quarter of the time it used to take me," 
said Dennis Costarakis, office manager of Prudential Bache's Carlsbad office 
and chairman of the local microcomputer investors club. He estimates that about 
35% of the club members use Turbo Tax. 
</P>
<P>
Chipman believes that more than 1.5 million tax returns were prepared with the 
program last year, including one belonging to a member of the staff at the 
Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
With those kind of results, Chipman dreams of building a large company. A very 
large company. He already offers income tax programs for 41 states -- the 
widest array in the industry. And he is considering developing related software 
such as a personal finance management program. Eventually, he believes, the 
company could gross $100 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Howard doesn't have that kind of ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"We purposely don't get into products that will increase our volume too high 
because then you lose the one-to-one contact with your customers," he said. "I 
have a little of the small-is-beautiful orientation. I don't want to make a lot 
of money as much as keep dealing with real people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only If It's Fun 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, HowardSoft, whose program sells for $295, appealing primarily to 
professional preparers and moonlighters, stopped providing programs for several 
states because it was "no longer fun," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the company is headquartered in an expensive 
ocean-front office suite in La Jolla even though it doesn't contribute much to 
the business, because that is fun. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Howard established his company for tax reasons. In 1979, he bought 
an Apple II computer for his children. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find something useful to do with it, so I wrote a real estate 
appraisal package and an income tax program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To legitimately deduct the cost of the computer as a business expense, he 
issued a press release to the largest computer magazines, announcing the 
programs. They published it, and that year he sold 50 copies of the tax 
software. 
</P>
<P>
The following year, he sold 200 programs. One was to a certified public 
accountant in Texas who encouraged him to pursue the business full time. In 
1981, he did just that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Customer Suggestions 
</P>
<P>
Howard believes that his program contains more depth than programs that sell 
for less than $100. But, for him, contact with his user base is the most 
rewarding aspect of the business. Every year he incorporates about 200 
suggestions for his customers into the program. 
</P>
<P>
The future for tax preparation software looks bright. 
</P>
<P>
"People eat, sleep, die and do taxes," said Prudential Bache's Costarakis. 
"And, if they don't do their taxes, they can go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 2 million tax forms will be filed electronically by paid 
preparers. Although individuals are not yet authorized to file electronically, 
ChipSoft is conducting a pilot project to facilitate the move in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several years, electronic filing could become popular. Not only 
are there fewer errors -- only 3% of electronically filed returns have 
mistakes, contrasted with 21% of paper returns, according to the IRS -- but 
refunds are issued within 18 days. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some drawbacks to income tax preparation programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have a very complex tax structure, you are doing yourself a disservice 
if you don't go to a CPA," Costarakis said. 
</P>
<P>
You also might want to consider what happened to Mike Chipman himself. Once, 
when asked if Turbo Tax handled a certain kind of transaction, he began to 
rattle off all of the relevant IRS forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you image walking around with all that worthless information in your 
mind?" he said.

DEADLINE MISSED IN BID TO BUY PRIVATE LEDGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boston-based LINSCO Financial Group has failed to complete its purchase of San 
Diego-based Private Ledger Financial Services from Crown Life Insurance of 
Canada, according to Crown Life Vice President Jeff Feeney. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was abandoned after the two companies failed to meet a Feb. 6 deadline 
contained in the sales agreement that LINSCO and Crown Life announced Jan. 5. 
LINSCO since "has come back with another proposal, but, in the meantime, we've 
gone back and talked to other people who are interested" in buying Private 
Ledger, Feeney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the midst of deliberations," Feeney said. "We hope to be selecting a 
buyer quickly and closing a deal, or announcing that the company is no longer 
for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Crown Life wants to quickly settle Private Ledger's future "because one problem 
with having it go along for this long is that everyone (involved) gets very 
apprehensive," Feeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Private Ledger is a San Diego-based company that has organized one of the 
nation's largest independent financial services networks. It has about 700 
brokers in 352 branch offices in 45 states. Agents are typically independent 
contractors who sell a variety of financial products, including stocks and 
bonds, mutual funds, limited partnerships and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Private Ledger reported a pretax profit of $1.6 million on 1987 revenue of 
$42.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Crown announced last year that it wanted to sell Private Ledger, which it 
acquired in 1984 for $10 million from American Principals Holdings, a 
now-defunct Del Mar-based investment firm. Private Ledger was acquired shortly 
after APHI was taken over by a court-ordered receiver at the request of the U. 
S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to SEC court filings, APHI 
officials unlawfully commingled investor funds. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Crown said it was selling Private Ledger as part of its strategy to 
redirect its energies and capital into its health insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want anyone to get the impression that we're going to go for another 
six months on this thing," Feeney said. "We want to announce something 
definitive very quickly."

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street professionals, who were wondering how strong the recent market 
really is, now know that the double whammy of higher inflation and a rise in 
both the prime and discount rates is enough to make the market pause and take 
note of reality, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas 
Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of San Diego stocks escaped the downturn. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Bancorp continued to move up, gaining $.75 and hitting a new high of 
$9.50 as investors continue to believe that the county's smaller banks are 
takeover targets. 
</P>
<P>
Western Health Plans was the largest percentage gainer of the week, moving up 
$.4375 to $1 after Mercy Services Corp., an affiliate of San Diego's Mercy 
Hospital and Medical Center, announced it would invest as much as $15 million 
to salvage the health-care plan operator. Mercy Services could eventually own 
45% of Western's stock. 
</P>
<P>
Price Co., which on Monday explained technical details of its preferred stock 
dividend, moved up $.75, largely on a favorable mention in the latest Fortune 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The downside for San Diego stocks was primarily populated by interest-sensitive 
stocks, with Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan down $1.50, Imperial Corp. of 
America down $.875 and Great American First Savings Bank down $.25. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, which is preparing its proxy statement for an 
April shareholder meeting on its merger with Southern California Edison, was 
down $.375. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher Scientific dropped $1.75 as it reported lower fourth-quarter earnings 
than expected -- $.27, down from $.30 the previous year, Katz said. The poor 
fourth quarter resulted in yearly earnings of .04. Henley Group, which controls 
more than 80% of Fisher, likewise dropped $1.75. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Laboratories was down $.75 after reporting disappointing second-quarter 
earnings of $.20, versus $.25 for the corresponding quarter the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Other stocks moving down included Cohu, down $1.625, and Cubic, down $1.125, 
after recent run-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholders of Langley who are still trying to find the quote for their stock 
should contact St. Catherine, Ontario-based Fleet Aerospace. Langley 
certificates should have been exchanged for Fleet Aerospace common and 
preferred, Katz said.

VALLEY EARNINGS: COMBINED HOTEL INVESTORS' PROFIT DROPS 85% DESPITE REVENUE 
RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp., whose stocks are paired on the 
New York Stock Exchange, reported an 85% drop in combined profit for 1988 
despite a 32% jump in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Investors Trust is a Woodland Hills real estate investment trust that 
invests in the lodging industry. Hotel Investors Corp., based in San Diego, is 
a hotel management company. 
</P>
<P>
In the year that ended Dec. 31, 1988, the companies' combined net income fell 
to $1.34 million from $8.82 million in 1987, although their revenue rose to $94 
million from $71.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The companies blamed the earnings drop on higher interest and depreciation 
costs related to acquisition of the Indian Wells Ramada Inn and two Las Vegas 
hotel/casinos, and to the lower-than-expected results of certain hotels in 
Texas and the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Hotel Investors Trust elected Leland R. Speed as chairman, and 
Hotel Investors Corp. named Earle F. Jones as its chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Speed, a trustee of the trust since 1985, also is a director of Eastover Group 
Cos., a group of real estate investment trusts. Jones, a director of Hotel 
Investors Corp. since 1985, also is president of MMI Hotel Group, a hotel 
operator in the Southeast.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: NEWHALL LAND &amp; FARMING LAUNCHES UNIT BUYBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newhall Land &amp; Farming in Valencia launched a buyback of up to 2 million, 
or 10%, of its ownership units in a transaction that could be valued as high as 
$112 million. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall, a real estate and agricultural concern, is organized as a master 
limited partnership whose units are publicly traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the company began a so-called Dutch auction tender offer, whereby 
Newhall unit holders who tender can specify the price they want within a range 
of $50 to $56 a unit. After the offer closes, Newhall will select a price 
within that range for payment to unit holders who tendered at or below that 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is part of Newhall's previously announced settlement of a 
class-action lawsuit that was brought by several dissident unit holders last 
year. As part of the settlement, Newhall agreed to buy back at least $40 
million of its units.

VALLEY EARNINGS: WHEEL MAKER'S PROFITS LEAP 60% FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Superior Industries International in Van Nuys said its fourth-quarter profit 
jumped 60% from a year earlier on a 20% gain in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Superior, which manufactures wheels for the major U.S. auto makers, said its 
net income in the quarter that ended Dec. 31 rose to $4.34 million from $2.72 
million a year earlier. Sales increased to $56.7 million from $47.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the gains to increased demand for its aluminum wheels, 
which spurred higher sales to General Motors and Ford Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
For all of 1988, Superior's profit climbed 39% to $13.1 million from $9.48 
million the previous year, and its annual sales rose 18% to $200.2 million from 
$169.5 million.

ART BUCHWALD: THE KGB TOWERS OVER ENQUIRING MINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One question I am constantly being asked is, "Did the press have the right to 
investigate and print stories about the private life of former Sen. John Tower 
when he was being considered by the Senate Armed Services Committee for the 
position of secretary of defense?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is, "Only if the Russians already knew about it." Tower's off-duty 
activities are nobody's business, with the exception of the National Enquirer. 
They are only significant if what he does for recreation could give aid and 
comfort to the enemy, while the enemy provides aid and comfort to him. 
</P>
<P>
Few people are aware that the KGB has a large department called The W&amp;D 
Division -- W&amp;D stands for Womanizing and Daiquiris. The purpose of the 
department is to find out which Pentagon officials like womanizing and which 
ones prefer to play miniature golf. If they discover an official who likes to 
do both, the KGB refers to such a person as a "twofer." 
</P>
<P>
With one of the largest budgets of any agency in the Soviet Union, the W&amp;D 
has training quarters, actually luxury hotels, where beautiful women are 
instructed on how to be friendly and warm to Westerners in high places. 
</P>
<P>
At this very moment, the KGB is holding a Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 
contest, with the most beautiful women from all over the Soviet Union 
competing. The winner gets 12,000 rubles, a Ziss convertible and an opportunity 
to meet a U.S. secretary of defense in the bar of her choice. 
</P>
<P>
The girls have to appear in bathing suits and then evening gowns. There is also 
a talent category. Each contestant is asked how she would get the NATO order of 
battle while making pillow talk. 
</P>
<P>
To make the contest more interesting, each woman has access to any clothing in 
Raisa Gorbachev's closet and is issued a Diner's Club camera hidden in the 
neckline, which goes click every time she is bitten on the neck. One of the 
most important qualities that the judges look for is how many people in high 
government positions she can catch in a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
I only mention what is going on in Moscow right now because our President can't 
be too careful when selecting a secretary of defense for this country. While 
Tower may not be guilty of anything, we would be fools to ignore the fact that 
the KGB's Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 is about to be chosen and start on her 
world tour. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB is a vicious, calculating organization and there is nothing it would 
like more than to have its beauty queen party with Sen. Tower on a nuclear 
submarine, even if he doesn't want to. The Russians are taking the position 
that Tower may not be a swinger, but they have to be ready for any emergency. 
While shooting photos of Tower's bedroom, a KGB man was overheard to say, 
"We're not talking about a man falling in love with an agent -- we're talking 
about finding out what's screwed onto the undercarriage of the Stealth bomber." 
</P>
<P>
The odds-on favorite to win the Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 title is Miss 
Smolensk. She used to be a ballet dancer with the Bolshoi, but she kept falling 
down and they had to let her go. She is not only reported to be a seductive 
Mata Hari, but she also speaks fluent Pentagonese. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the KGB officials have big plans for the winner. They are going to 
ensure that she meets Tower at the Military-Industrial-Complex Cotillion in 
Washington, which defense company lobbyists hold every year to present their 
daughters to Washington society. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Secretary of Defense 1989 will have strict orders that under no 
circumstances is she to discuss "Star Wars" with Tower until their second date. 
</P>
<P>
The KGB has never denied that attempting to make Tower a security risk is a 
dirty business, but they say if they don't do it, who will?

FAT, SUGAR IN BRAN CEREALS IMPORTANT POINT TO CONSIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Do bran cereals really provide as much fiber as the manufacturers 
claim? This seems to be one of the biggest selling points lately for all kinds 
of cereals. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Some bran cereals do provide substantial amounts of fiber, as much as 9 
grams for each serving; however, I suggest you check on the fat and sugar 
content of the cereal before making a choice. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would appreciate it if you would clarify the amount of sodium a person 
should have. My husband is well over 6 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds. I'm a 
foot shorter and weigh a hundred pounds less. It doesn't make sense that we 
should both take in the same amount of sodium. Does the difference in size make 
any difference in this? 
</P>
<P>
A: The amount of sodium an individual is permitted is related to the number of 
calories he or she consumes each day; obviously, you and your husband do not 
consume the same number of calories. 
</P>
<P>
A teaspoon of salt contains 2,300 milligrams of sodium. You should limit your 
consumption of sodium to no more than 1,000 milligrams for every 1,000 calories 
you consume. Thus, you and your husband would not have the same sodium intake.

TODAY'S DANCE MOVES ARE THRILLING BUT BACK-BREAKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some things never change, so the saying goes, but that has rarely been said 
about dance. 
</P>
<P>
The acrobatic displays and breathtaking pyrotechnics that abound in the 
contemporary repertory are a far cry from the ethereal lifts and elegant 
posturing of classical ballet. Dancers have changed, too. Pavlova, the reigning 
goddess of her day, would have been hard-pressed to compete with any 
contemporary ballerina in technical feats and sheer stamina, despite her 
charismatic presence and extraordinary performing brio. 
</P>
<P>
Today's dance designs reflect today's dancers. The new breed is better trained 
and more in tune with their instruments than its predecessors. And, like most 
athletes these days, they have greater strength and endurance. Legs extend 
higher, back bends dip lower and torsos stretch with the suppleness of Pla-Doh. 
As a result, contemporary choreographers have pushed the boundaries of their 
art form to the maximum in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at 'Les Sylphides,' there was a lot of posing and running back and 
forth, and plenty of mime," said Dance magazine correspondent William Fark. 
"And there were much fewer physical demands on the dancers. Men would walk to 
the center of the stage. Now it's all very technical dancing. The change in 
men's dancing is really incredible. 
</P>
<P>
"Nureyev sparked a lot of it when he defected in 1957, but, if it hadn't been 
for Nureyev, Villella would have been the one to start the trend," said Fark, 
an ex-dancer himself. "I couldn't do the lifts they do now when I was dancing." 
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, dancers have made even greater strides in their 
physical development, as Fark noted. And dance-makers are using these abilities 
in their cutting-edge choreography. He attributes the quantum leap to a 
combination of factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Better nutrition and better builds have a lot to do with it," he noted. 
"Dancers are much more capable. And now, with mass audiences that are not 
attuned to the nuances of dance, everything is more exhibitionist. Margot 
Fonteyn had a beautiful back, and you concentrated on fine points like a 
dancer's line in her day. 
</P>
<P>
"Now dancers do things that only contortionists used to do, like some of the 
splits in Arpino's 'Light Rain' (danced in San Diego last season). That kind of 
thing was unheard of a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The ever-increasing technical demands on dancers may mean more thrills for 
concert-goers. But they can wreak havoc on the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Denise Dabrowski had a taste of life with the prestigious Joffrey 
Ballet. However, the punishing demands of big-league dance aggravated a back 
problem that Dabrowski keeps in check with the light performance load she 
carries at the California Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"Choreographers are breaking new ground now, and they're breaking some backs, 
too," she said with a nervous laugh. "I saw a high turnover while I was there 
from injuries and just plain burnout. It's exciting that they've come so far 
technically, but it was a lot easier doing the classics, where you don't have 
to see how far you can distort your body." 
</P>
<P>
Even world-class dance companies are feeling the pinch. Alvin Ailey American 
Dance Theater, a modern dance troupe known for its heavy accent on 
state-of-the-art virtuosity and no-holds-barred physicality, is one of many 
contemporary companies whose ranks are getting harder to fill these days -- due 
to these new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
When the Ailey company dances a five-performance run at Symphony Hall on 
Wednesday through March 5, the men will be outnumbered by the women, 15 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in need of men in the company," Ailey soloist Renee Robinson said in an 
interview from the road. "It's become harder to find good, strong men to handle 
our choreography. Women have to work hard, too, but these days there is more 
and more lifting -- and the lifts are much more complicated than ever." 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are very different today, since the dancing is more risky," 
Masazumi Chaya, Ailey rehearsal director and a former principal, said by 
telephone from Alaska (one of many faraway stops on the Ailey touring trail). 
"You still need a lot of personality and a sense of style and line. That hasn't 
changed. But the trickier choreography and our broad range of styles make it 
harder to find men. They need all these qualities, not just technique -- and 
not just from the book." 
</P>
<P>
The grueling schedules exacerbate the situation, Chaya noted. 
</P>
<P>
"We do eight performances a week in New York, and others for the kids, and then 
we do a lot of traveling. It's really hard," he said. "And we rehearse two to 
three hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
How do the dancers cope with the rigors of dancing with the best in the nation 
-- performing choreography that thrives on high-velocity moves, near-miss 
collisions, and devilishly difficult lifts? 
</P>
<P>
"They need more knowledge of their own bodies, and a lot of stretching in the 
warm-ups," said Chaya, chuckling. "It takes a lot of rehearsals, too, so they 
learn to control their falls and make it safe. Our dancers understand about 
body training and physical therapy." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the improved training techniques and nutritional knowledge, a 
dancer's days are numbered, said Ailey dancer Andre Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only hope for 5 to 10 years, but you probably won't be able to dance 
beyond 30," said the 28-year-old Tyson. "I'm pretty lucky, I've been with the 
company for almost four years. I'm very careful about nutrition, and I've had a 
few injuries, but I learned through the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to be in good shape. I work out in the gymnasium, and I do 
some weight lifting, but that can have an adverse effect, because you don't 
want so much bulk. Overall, today's dances are more difficult, and our company 
is more physical. We do a lot of high-energy things and technical partnering, 
but we also have to create mood and do a lot of theatrical acting." 
</P>
<P>
"Today, careers are often short-lived," said Jack Cheever, director of the 
Center for Sports Medicine in San Diego. "The dancers are so hyper-mobile now, 
and all that flexibility takes a heavy toll on their bodies. In addition, 
dancers are chronically trying to starve themselves, because of the pressure to 
keep their weight down." 
</P>
<P>
FOOT NOTES: San Diego dance fans can have a field day with the Ailey company 
oeuvre. The troupe will dance five different programs at Symphony Hall, doing 
18 separate works spanning much of the history of the celebrated company. 
Signature pieces, including Ailey's vintage masterworks -- "Revelations" and 
"Blues Suite" -- will be performed along with such recent additions to the 
repertory as "Shards," a complex choreographic potpourri created by Donald 
Byrd, and "Tell It Like It Is," Kelvin Rotardier's solo for virtuoso Gary 
DeLoatch.

The all-Spanish Univision television hopes that comedian Paul Rodriguez's first 
television special in Spanish will lead to other TV projects combining elements 
of "Saturday Night Live" and David Letterman's show. "Hecho en America" aired 
Sunday night on Univision's KMEX Channel 34, and network president Joaquin 
Blaya now envisions 13 weekly shows or three or four specials hosted by the 
Mexican-born comedian Rodriguez. Blaya said network officials will meet with 
Rodriguez in coming weeks to discuss these options. ALEENE MacMINN

'NINJA 3': BLAND LEADING THE BLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The karate genre is alive, if hardly kicking, in "American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt" 
(citywide). 
</P>
<P>
The silly fight scenes gave a few sound-effects experts a lot of work, even if 
the violent snaps, crackles and pops on the sound track don't precisely match 
the fights staged on screen. It's a cinch that the sound men still put far more 
care into their work than did writer-director Cedric Sundstrom, who has 
bothered neither with wit nor logic. 
</P>
<P>
All that the tedious "Ninja 3" has in common with with two earlier "Ninjas" is 
the likable presence of Steve James as the brawny black sidekick. The new white 
lead in this episode is the wooden but hunky David Bradley, playing Sean 
Davidson, a young man who mastered martial arts after seeing his karate-champ 
father gunned down at a tournament by robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Either the lead character or the screenwriter seems to have forgotten the 
father after the prologue, and thus, the hero never seems to recognize the 
baddies as the very same scum who orphaned him. Gifted with a poor memory and 
stripped of a revenge motive, Davidson mostly just worries about the bad guys' 
cache of homicidal germs as he demolishes craniums by the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
Even flamboyant Marjoe Gortner, who has made a career out of being -- as Daffy 
Duck would say -- deth-spicable, is bland unto death here as the chief bad guy. 
For a movie with so many flying feet, "American Ninja 3" (MPAA-rated R) is 
amazingly short on kicks. 
</P>
<P>
'AMERICAN NINJA 3: BLOOD HUNT' 
</P>
<P>
A Cannon presentation. Producer Harry Alan Towers. Director/writer Cedric 
Sundstrom. Executive producer Avi Lerner. Editor Michael J. Duthie. Music

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: PROGRAM GIVES STUDENTS 
SOME KEYS TO THE ORGAN 
</P>

With music instruction diminishing in the public schools, local musical 
organizations continue to find ways to take up some of the slack. This year, 
the Spreckels Organ Society is sponsoring biweekly performances on the Balboa 
Park organ for fifth-graders. According to San Diego civic organist Robert 
Plimpton, these outreach concerts were designed to fit into the San Diego 
Unified School District's program of providing all fifth-grade students with a 
weeklong exposure to Balboa Park's museums and other cultural institutions. 
</P>
<P>
On alternate Friday afternoons, Plimpton meets with 300 students and their 
teachers, demonstrating the unique outdoor Spreckels Organ and playing a 
program designed to appeal to their musical predilections. Each program lasts 
just under an hour. Lyle Blackinton, the organ's curator, brings out some of 
the pipes from the organ chamber to show the students what they look like and 
how they produce their individual sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"On a typical program, I'll play Bach's Toccata in D Minor because they have 
heard it and associate it with 'Phantom of the Opera.' I then play the end of 
the 'William Tell' Overture so I can explain a little about opera and tell them 
that the piece is more than the 'Lone Ranger' theme song," Plimpton said. 
</P>
<P>
Because movies form the youngsters' basic shared experience, Plimpton has 
arranged a medley based on John Williams' scores to "E.T." and "Jaws." 
</P>
<P>
"I also made a big pedal solo from the 'Star Wars' theme. If my friends in 
Pennsylvania could see me now," Plimpton quipped. Before coming to San Diego 
and taking the civic organist post, Plimpton was the music director of a 
Presbyterian church in Bryn Mawr, a Philadelphia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-graders ask Plimpton the expected questions: How much did the organ 
cost? How long did it take to construct it? Their comments, however, are not 
always as predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"One student wore a flowing black cape to the program because she assumed she 
would be playing the park organ that day," Plimpton said. "And another bounded 
up after I was finished and told me that she wanted my job when she grew up." 
Undaunted by such potential competition, the civic organist will give his next 
demonstration at 1:30 p.m. Friday. He noted that park visitors of all ages are 
welcome to sit in. 
</P>
<P>
To L.A. with love. Local soprano Virginia Sublett has signed another contract 
with Los Angeles Music Center Opera. In February, 1990, she will sing the role 
of Nanetta in four performances of Verdi's "Falstaff." She made her debut with 
L.A.'s bustling new company in its inaugural season's production of Handel's 
"Alcina" and returned last season to appear in Britten's "A Midsummer Night's 
Dream." 
</P>
<P>
Local fans of Sublett can hear her in a lieder recital at St. James Episcopal 
Church, La Jolla, at 4 p.m. May 7. She will be accompanied by former San Diego 
Opera chorus master Clay Pendergrass, who now holds a similar position at 
Cincinnati Opera. 
</P>
<P>
They're looking for a few good men. The Pacific Men's Chorale is recruiting 
members for its May concert at St. Paul's Episcopal Cathedral. The 2-year-old 
chorus is also offering a $300 scholarship to the winner of its young male 
vocalist scholarship competition, which is open to singers from the ages of 17 
to 20. Interested vocalists should contact chorale director Robert Boucher 
(943-0106). 
</P>
<P>
Have concerto, will travel. Speaking of competitions, the San Diego Symphony's 
annual young artist concerto competition took place this weekend at Symphony 
Hall. About 21 applicants, all under the age of 19, played on Saturday, while 
the finalists gave a 2p.m. concert Sunday afternoon. First-place winner Lin 
Hong will receive a $500 cash prize and the opportunity to perform with the San 
Diego Symphony on its two Young Peoples' concerts at the end of March and on 
the Family Concert on April 1. Hong, a 17-year-old pianist from the Peoples 
Republic of China, is a freshman at San Diego State University, a student of 
Karen Follingstad. Cellist Felix Fan, the Bishop's School eight-grader, took 
second place, and pianist Hiroko Kunitake, a student at Muirlands Junior High 
School, won third place. 
</P>
<P>
How about calling it the Chameleon Room? Although the downtown Omni Hotel's 
City Colors Room regularly plays host to the popular Lites Out jazz program 
Monday nights, its Monday noon-hour concerts take on a significantly different 
hue. San Diego Mini-Concerts abandoned the Lyceum Theatre after a single 
season, and is now offering its classical chamber music programs above ground 
at the Omni. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mini-Concerts will present virtuoso recorder player David Bellugi, 
accompanied by harpsichordist Nelson Huber, in a program of Baroque recorder 
gems. Bellugi, a native New Yorker who now teaches at the Florence (Italy) 
National Conservatory, has made extensive early music recordings on European 
labels.

'COACH' NEEDS A GAME PLAN -- AND MORE LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A network's ways can be mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach" is finally coming off the bench. In what's being billed as a sneak 
preview, the ABC comedy premieres at 9:30 tonight (on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42), where it's expected to get a huge sampling following the hit "Roseanne." 
"Coach" then reappears in its regular time slot at 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good, except that Wednesday's second episode is actually the pilot, 
which sets up the series and tonight's first episode. So tonight's viewers will 
be wondering why coach Hayden Fox (Craig T. Nelson) repeatedly groans about 
being "new" to parenting. After all, his daughter Kelly (Clare Carey) is 18. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's episode will explain that Hayden is a divorcee, and that Kelly only 
recently has come to live with her father while attending Minnesota State 
college, where he is football coach. 
</P>
<P>
What "Coach" needs even more than a game plan, however, are laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, in an episode nearly as inept as the Screaming Eagles he coaches, 
Hayden goes berserk when he learns that Kelly has a date with a middle-aged 
professor. There are some nice moments between Hayden and his doltish assistant 
(Jerry Van Dyke), but nothing to compensate for an otherwise witless story 
burdened by hackneyed, brain-versus-brawn characters. 
</P>
<P>
Although no rocket, Wednesday's episode is stronger and funnier than tonight's, 
injecting at least some nuance and amusement into this dormant father-daughter 
relationship. Meanwhile, Hayden gets romantic with a TV newscaster (Shelley 
Fabares). 
</P>
<P>
The cast performs intelligently, but deserves better material. For "Coach," not 
a championship season. HOWARD ROSENBERG

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: PETER WOLLEN FILMS FEATURED AT MELNITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"The Films of Peter Wollen," composed of four films to be presented by the UCLA 
Film and Television Archive over the next three Thursdays, commences Thursday 
at 7:30 p.m. in Melnitz Theater with "Friendship's Death" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Wollen, a British film theoretician and experimental film maker, will be 
present. The witty and provocative "Friendship's Death" is in essence a 
two-character chamber drama, yet it avoids the stagy. Tilda Swinton plays an 
elegant extraterrestrial on a mission of peace to MIT who inadvertently winds 
up in Amman, Jordan, during "Black September" in 1970 where she encounters a 
likable, veteran journalist (Bill Paterson, warmly remembered from Bill 
Forsyth's "Comfort and Joy"). This deft anti-war parable concludes with a 
remarkable coda, as challenging and enigmatic as the conclusion of Antonioni's 
"The Passenger," which Wollen wrote with Mark Peploe and Antonioni. 
</P>
<P>
The archive's second weekend of films by Finland's Kaurismaki brothers is as 
enjoyable as the first, with the exception of one film. The Kaurismakis are 
fresh and vital, and their work is as deserving of recognition and exposure as 
that of the best European film makers. The series continues Saturday at 7:30 at 
Melnitz Theater with Aki Kaurismaki's "Calamari Union" (1985) and Mika 
Kaurismaki's "Helsinki Napoli All Night Long" (1987) -- a mediocre 
English-language comedy you can well afford to skip. 
</P>
<P>
There's a highly developed sense of the absurd, expressed in deadpan humor, 
that characterizes the work of both brothers. Both are tellers of shaggy dog 
stories that capture a sense of aimlessness in life, and of the two, Aki is 
especially spare and rigorous in his style. Aki's "Calamari Union" is as droll 
as it is demanding. In the heart of working-class Helsinki, 17 men, seemingly 
ranging in age from the late 20s to the late 30s, all named Frank and all 
wearing dark glasses, meet and agree that no matter what, they're determined to 
make it to the suburb of Eira. Immediately, we're plunged into a nightmarish 
fantasy in which the Franks, despite their most fervent efforts, never get 
anywhere, seemingly trapped in an unending series of calamitous incidents. 
Aki's humor is very -- very -- dry, and the film emerges as social commentary 
at its most subtle. 
</P>
<P>
Mika's lovely 1980 "The Liar" (Sunday at 7:30) stars Aki -- then 23 -- as a 
coltish Jean-Pierre Leaud-like young intellectual, drifting through a Helsinki 
summer and pursuing romance. "The Liar" is a film of much charm and style and 
reflects strongly the influence of France's New Wave, especially Godard. "The 
Liar" is followed by Aki's "Shadows in Paradise" (1987), one of the strongest 
films in the series. As in "Calamari Union" Aki captures a Helsinki that's cold 
and impersonal as he charts a highly tentative romance between a garbage 
collector (Matti Pellonpaa) and a supermarket cashier (Kati Outinen), two 
loners buffeted about by the harshness of working-class life. These two actors, 
both unglamorous and generally sullen, make these two absolutely real; Aki can 
discover humor in his couple, but it's never at their expense. "Shadows in 
Paradise" makes telling use of American -- or American-influenced -- pop music, 
jazz and blues, an Aki trademark. (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013. 
</P>
<P>
Among the films screening in USC's Norris Theater during the opening weekend of 
"The Contemporary Art Scene in Austria" is Christian Berger's starkly beautiful 
"Raffl" (1984), screening Sunday at 8:45. Instead of another retelling of the 
martyrdom of Andreas Hofer, a leader in the resistance against the French 
occupation of the Austrian Tyrol in 1810, Berger concentrates on Hofer's uneasy 
betrayer, debt-ridden farmer Franz Raffl. Terse and ironic, with strikingly 
composed images and an imaginative use of natural sounds, "Raffl" is set 
against harsh, wintry landscapes as it expresses the inner conflicts of the 
stoic Raffl (Lois Weinberger, in a remarkable interior performance) who emerges 
more a victim than a Judas. "The Contemporary Art Scene in Austria," which 
includes multimedia presentations, seminars and the American premiere of 
Wolfgang Bauer's black comedy, "A Wonderful Morning in the Barber Shop."

AIDS NEWS MAGAZINE BEGINS ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The AIDS Quarterly" (tonight at 9 on Channels 28 and 15, at 10 on Channel 50) 
takes the news magazine format to the next logical level: hourlong, quarterly 
reports on a single issue. In this case, the issue demands no less. One of 
AIDS' most sinister qualities is its inexhaustible ability to find new social 
sectors to infect. Whether this video magazine, produced by PBS affiliate 
WGBH-TV in Boston and hosted by Peter Jennings, can keep up with the pandemic 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's first edition suggests that it will. The unifying theme of the two 
segments, "The Education of Admiral Watkins" and "A Death in the Family," is of 
conservative heterosexual white men forced to face the social and emotional 
realities of the disease, finding their personal values and assumptions upended 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. James Watkins, picked by Ronald Reagan to head the Presidential Commission 
on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic, was a Navy man thrown into a 
crisis that he readily admits he had no appreciation for. The report follows 
Watkins and his group, lambasted by AIDS activists for their ignorance of the 
disease's dimensions, as they crisscross the country on a fact-finding mission. 
</P>
<P>
They find that the virus is killing families, babies and runaway teens no less 
than homosexual men, that the medical infrastructure is physically and 
financially incapable of the double demands of finding a cure and caring for 
the infected, and that intolerance and neglect for those infected is as viral 
as the disease itself. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, in a remarkable confession, says that the commission's investigation 
"softened my military views. Being on the Joint Chiefs of Staff was a piece of 
cake next to combatting AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
The softening of Dr. Joseph Pace's heart is at the core of "A Death in the 
Family," in which the dying days of his AIDS-infected son, Malcolm, bring a 
profound moral dilemma to the surface. On one hand, the Paces are Mormons, and 
Malcolm had fled the church for the love of men -- a paramount sin in 
Mormonism. On the other hand, the family is Mormonism's bedrock; after years of 
admitted coldness toward his son, Joseph must at last confront his paternal 
duty at Malcolm's deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
The father observes that "I love my son and my religious beliefs. They don't 
mix." Yet the family comes together, and the camera intimately watches them. 
Too intimately, some might feel. But such close-up reporting is television's 
way of confronting its own past denial of the disease. ROBERT KOEHLER

MORNING BRIEFING: YOU COULD SEE FUTURE BY LOOKING IN MIRROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"TYSON STOPS BRUNO IN 5," screamed the headline in Britain's Daily Mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Not particularly creative, true, but then again it did appear five days before 
last weekend's celebrated fight in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirror, stretching the definition of journalism to new lengths, not only 
called the fight but provided a round-by-round description and even published 
"post-fight" quotes. 
</P>
<P>
The Round 5 description included the following: 
</P>
<P>
"Britain's dazed hero tries to fight his way back to the centre of the ring, 
but a thundering left hook sends him falling back into the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
"The referee leaps between the two boxers and leads brave, battered Frank back 
to his corner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all over after 1 minute 40 seconds of the fifth round." 
</P>
<P>
It was 2:55 into the round, actually, but who's counting. 
</P>
<P>
Add Tyson-Bruno: Best line of the HBO telecast came from Larry Merchant, 
although it's doubtful the folks in Glasgow or Edinburgh would have appreciated 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Bruno) lasts another two rounds, they may give him Scotland," Merchant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What two things do Joe Sambito, Tim Lollar, Sammy Stewart, Steve 
Crawford, Dave Stapleton and Don Baylor have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Batter up: The Washington Post's Tony Kornheiser was less than impressed by 
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser's remark after signing his $7.9-million contract 
that he was "back to being warm and goosey about being a Dodger." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kornheiser: "I should hope so. For $7,000 a day, I could be warm and 
goosey about being a lab rat." 
</P>
<P>
Now on the mound, Rick Rodent? 
</P>
<P>
Words to live by: Iran Barkley, discounting rumors that he was not perhaps the 
fighter he imagined, had quite a bit to say before his bout with Roberto Duran. 
</P>
<P>
"Let 'em all talk about me," he said. "And let Duran believe it all. Let it 
boost his ego up. That way it will be even more of a shock when I kick his 
butt." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't stop there, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad he's in shape," Barkley said. "That will make it easier for him to 
fit into his coffin." 
</P>
<P>
Nor was that all. Barkley even scoffed at a possible Sugar Ray Leonard-Duran 
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget Leonard-Duran," he said. "It'll never happen. There's no way I'm going 
to let this fat old guy beat me." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's best not to anger fat old guys. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: All six were members of the Boston Red Sox 1986 American League 
championship team and all six are out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
Dick Beaty, NASCAR-Winston Cup director, on the 24-hour cars that run at 
Daytona: "They don't resemble anything on earth. . . . When Kyle Petty ran one, 
it had so many switches he had to pull off the track to figure out how to turn 
the lights on."

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: CRENSHAW AND MANUAL ARTS FINALLY MEET AGAIN -- IN 
TITLE GAME FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lonnie White 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A little more than a year ago, people were considering the 1987-88 Crenshaw 
High School boys' basketball team as maybe the best in the school's history. 
After all, the Cougars had just defeated Manual Arts for the City 4-A 
championship, 83-67. 
</P>
<P>
But they fell from their lofty place in the Cougar Hall of Fame quickly. Two 
weeks later, in the semifinals of the state tournament, Manual Arts bounced 
back and surprised Crenshaw, 89-82, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
With that defeat, Crenshaw lost its chance for a fourth state title in the last 
six seasons. The Toilers went on to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Crenshaw (20-2) will play Manual Arts (24-0) for the first time 
this season in the Reebok City 4-A title game at the Sports Arena. The Cougars 
will be playing for their fifth City title in the last season years. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts has won 28 consecutive games since last season's loss to Crenshaw 
in the City title game, having defeated highly regarded Westchester twice 
during the regular season. Last Friday night, the Toilers advanced to the City 
final for the second consecutive year, with a 50-44 win over Carson. 
</P>
<P>
After losing an early 14-point lead against the Colts, the Toilers rallied, 
thanks largely to seniors William Celestine and Kent Bennett. Celestine 
provided two key baskets and Bennett's spectacular dunk on a lob pass from 
guard Marcell Capers sparked a late fourth-quarter rally. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's plan of shutting off the inside and allowing the Toilers shots from 
the perimeter, proved effective, as Manual Arts failed to connect on many open 
jump shots. Capers, the Toilers' junior point guard, made less than 35% of his 
shots from the floor, in scoring 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said a lot of pressure will be on Capers, 
who played for the Cougars last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Marcell will have to stay calm and let the game flow," said Simpson, who is in 
his first season as coach after taking over for Reggie Morris. "The fact that 
he played with many of the Crenshaw players will have his emotions running high 
and make it tough on him. I am sure that (the Crenshaw players) feel as if he 
deserted them a little, and that they will want to shut him down." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also realizes that this is just not an ordinary game because of the 
intensity of the Crenshaw-Manual Arts rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing for us is to stay relaxed and not let our emotions take over," 
Simpson said. "Crenshaw just keeps coming with its pressure. We will have to be 
consistent in breaking the press and take high percentage shots. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the biggest rivalries in the area. Most of these guys played 
with each other in junior high school. I feel that both teams have paid the 
price to be here in the finals." 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw earned its place with a 60-47 win over Fairfax last Friday night. The 
Cougars trailed at halftime, 23-17, but guard Terry Cannon made 17 second-half 
points as they rallied in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Willie West, who has won 10 City titles, is back in the final again, 
despite the loss of Capers and the graduation of three All-City seniors from 
last season's team. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars may not have their usual height, but they do have depth. Several 
times against Fairfax, West substituted four or five players at once. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars also have the 6-foot-1 Cannon, who leads the team in scoring. 
Throughout the playoffs, the Cougars have relied on him to supply their spark. 
In their quarterfinal win over Westchester, Crenshaw struggled early while 
Cannon misfired, but once he started hitting, Crenshaw breezed and he finished 
with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
Said Simpson: "Crenshaw does not rebuild, it just reloads." 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' City 4-A final, Crenshaw will play Washington for the fourth time 
this season. The Cougars, The Times' top rated team throughout the season, have 
defeated the Generals in two of the three previous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw beat Dorsey in the semifinals at the Sports Arena last Friday, 53-39, 
as senior guards Claudia (Coco) Jones and Allison Jackson, scored 14 and 13 
points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has been the key for the Cougars all season. She led the Cougars against 
the Dons, despite missing most of the second half because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for us to do well, we have to have Coco in the game," Crenshaw Coach 
Major Dennis said. "She has been in foul trouble throughout the playoffs, and 
we need her 21 points and 8 steals a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Coco's greatest asset is her defense, which also has been the source of her 
foul problems. We need her ability to go to the basket to set up our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis said that the Cougars will have to stop Washington's guards, Remitha 
Houston and Detra Lockhart. They combined for 32 points in the Generals' 62-55 
victory over Reseda in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"They are great offensive guards," Dennis said. "We have to stop at least one 
of them or we'll lose. We cannot have them both score 25 points. We have been 
successful in stopping them before and we'll just have to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
In the last meeting between the teams, Washington played a man-to-man defense, 
then switched to a zone in the fourth quarter, erased an eight-point deficit 
and won. Washington Coach Phil Chase said that his team wore the Cougars down 
with the pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we went to a zone, they were not able to hit from the outside, he said. 
"We are a little deeper than them, so we were fresher in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is to not let them get any easy shots off of turnovers. The Sports 
Arena is a bigger place than most high school gyms and shooting percentages 
usually go down. This will be a game where you have to take the playing 
conditions into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis agreed, but said that the importance of the game will over-ride the 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is simple." he said. "Whoever gets tired will get to stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' 3-A City final, Los Angeles High (18-8) will play Fremont (26-3)

CHALLENGING ROUND FOR APPLAUSE; 
</P>
<P>
OWNERS' FINANCIAL WOES, MARKET SHIFTS COULD UNDERMINE SUCCESSFUL WOODLAND HILLS 
GIFT AND NOVELTY COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Applause Inc.'s slogan this year is "Breakin' Away in '89," and Applause 
President Robert G. Solomon calls it a "battle cry" to motivate the company's 
1,300 employees to sprint ahead of their competition. 
</P>
<P>
But Applause's race with its competitors this year may resemble a high hurdles 
contest more than a sprint. After three years in which it doubled in size, 
Applause is facing problems that could cause it to stumble if the company is 
not careful. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Woodland Hills company has emerged as one of the 
nation's largest gift and novelty companies. Last year, it sold about $200 
million worth of stuffed toys and dolls, plastic figurines, key chains and 
decorative mugs, compared to sales of less than $100 million in 1986. The 
company's products, which feature a logo showing a pair of clapping hands, are 
sold in 75,000 gift, card, florist and stationery shops nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
One question about Applause concerns its ownership. In May, control of the 
company was bought by Avalon Marketing, a Los Angeles company that is itself 
controlled by the wealthy Thompson family of Dallas, for $92.5 million cash and 
stock worth $23.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The financial woes of the Thompsons, whose holdings include Southland Corp. and 
its 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores, have been making news for the past 
few months, with Fortune magazine recently calling their financial saga "The 
Texas Chain Store Massacre." 
</P>
<P>
The family borrowed about $5 billion to buy Southland in 1987 and has been 
selling the company's assets furiously to pay down the debt. In addition, the 
Thompsons developed a 42-story Dallas office building called Cityplace Center 
that has been a financial disaster. 
</P>
<P>
David Bowe, a vice president of Thompson Co. in Dallas, declined to comment 
about Applause or other Thompson investments. But some observers are asking 
whether Applause might be the next Thompson asset to be put on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Not likely, said Dennis Telzrow, a retail analyst at Eppler, Guerin &amp; 
Turner in Dallas, who has followed the Thompsons and developments at Southland. 
He said the family fortune is somewhat insulated from the problems at 
Southland, which was bought mostly with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like (Dallas businessman) Bum Bright, who put the Dallas Cowboys on 
the block because had had a problem personally," Telzrow said. "The Thompsons 
are not required to sell a lot of their (personal) assets because of what's 
going on at Southland." 
</P>
<P>
Two-thirds of Applause's business involves "plush toys" -- cuddly stuffed 
animals and dolls. And that business softened dramatically last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade 
group based in New York, sales of "traditional" plush toys, or low-tech stuffed 
animals and dolls without electronic gadgetry inside, plunged 44% to 94 million 
units last year, while the wholesale dollar value of such toys sold by 
manufacturers tumbled 30% to $596 million. 
</P>
<P>
Also, gift company executives complain that increased competition from new 
manufacturers diluted the market as sales were slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. McEntee, president of Applause's rival Russ Berrie &amp; Co in 
Oakland, N.J., said: "1988 was not a a great year for plush toys. A lot of 
people got into the business and saturated the market." 
</P>
<P>
Such a steep drop is puzzling because 1986 and 1987 were big years for plush 
toys. Toy and gift makers speculate that children and parents opted to spend 
money on video games and traditional toys such as Barbie dolls in lieu of 
stuffed animals and toys. They also blame department stores, which virtually 
gave away stuffed bears in sales promotions. 
</P>
<P>
"They really crippled the market," Applause's Solomon said. "There's no 
question everyone in the gift and toy industry felt a softening in the plush 
area." 
</P>
<P>
Solomon recognizes that the gift and toy business is not child's play. So he 
responded by making what he calls a "left turn" in Applause's business. Rather 
than get slaughtered in the market by producing "generic" products such as 
stuffed bears, he said, he aggressively went after the "licensed character" 
market, where he said demand remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
Licensed characters are often cartoon characters, many of them made famous in 
movies, books or on television. Applause sells stuffed toys and figurines 
featuring Roger Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, E. T., the Smurfs, the California Raisins 
and Raggedy Ann. Coming later this year is a Batman doll, which Applause 
expects to be a hit product after a feature film, starring actor Michael 
Keaton, is released in June. (For more on Batman, please see the Marketing 
column, Page 6.) 
</P>
<P>
Dolls and figurines representing licensed characters make up about 50% of 
Applause's sales, with only 10% involving the "generic" stuffed animals and 
toys. Among its best-selling products lately have been California Raisins 
characters, based on the popular television commercials for the California 
Raisin Advisory Board in Fresno. The dancing raisins have brought Applause more 
than $25 million in fees and sales of toys in less than two years, Solomon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some gift companies shy away from licensed characters. For one thing, the owner 
of the license typically gets 5% to 10% of sales. In addition, the public is 
fickle about such characters. 
</P>
<P>
"Licensed products such as Roger Rabbit and Spuds MacKenzie come and go," said 
McEntee, the Russ Berrie president, who nonetheless makes a stuffed toy based 
on the television character ALF. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Produced Overseas 
</P>
<P>
Solomon said the characters are selected carefully and that he prefers "classic 
characters" that clearly have a long life span, such as Raggedy Ann and Walt 
Disney's Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
"We say no to licenses nine out of 10 times. We said no to the 'Willows' and 
the 'Howard the Ducks' of the world," he added, referring to two recent films. 
</P>
<P>
The stuffed toys and dolls that Applause sells are made in South Korea and 
China and typically sell in stores for less than $20. To protect Applause from 
big swings, Solomon said, the company makes sure that no more than 10% of 
Applause's business will be based on any one product and that no more than 2% 
of its sales are from any one retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon, 36, started working as a salesman in 1975 for the company, when it was 
based in Van Nuys and known as Wallace Berrie &amp; Co. Berrie, the brother of 
Russ Berrie, retired in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Applause later became a partnership owned by Solomon and two other men, Larry 
Elins, who is retired, and Harris Toibb, who serves as Applause's chairman. 
Last May, Solomon was named president after working as executive vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Solomon likes to use vivid metaphors when describing Applause. On a company 
videotape, he tells his 500-person sales staff that the retail business is like 
"Mt. Fuji." Applause, he says, does not want to aim for the top of the 
mountain, where exclusive stores such as Tiffany &amp; Co. are, or for the 
bottom, where he says one finds mass merchandise outfits such as K mart and 
Toys R Us. Instead, he says, he wants to be in the middle, where he finds such 
stores as Hallmark card stores and airport gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
Applause is highly profitable, according to Securities and Exchange Commission 
documents filed by Avalon. In the fiscal year that ended last June 30, Avalon's 
gift ware division, which is mostly Applause, had operating income of $28.7 
million on sales of $191.2 million.

REAL COST OF S&amp;L BAILOUT DEPENDS ON 'WHAT IF ?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pick a number, any number -- the larger the better -- and it has probably been 
cited as the cost of President Bush's S&amp;L bailout plan. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, there was the $90-billion estimate presented by the 
Administration when it announced the plan early this month. That represents the 
total cost of paying off all the depositors in roughly 200 savings and loan 
associations that were shut down by the federal government last year and 
perhaps 350 more that are still operating but currently insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
Then the fun began. Numbers started flying: $126 billion, $157 billion, $200 
billion, and, soaring into the stratosphere, $335 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of sorting out some of the confusion, here are answers to several 
questions about the costs of the S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So what's the bottom line for taxpayers? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nobody really knows. It all depends on what economic assumptions are used. 
If interest rates are higher than the Administration expects over the next 
three years, if the assets owned by insolvent S&amp;Ls are worth less than 
predicted and if surviving thrift institutions do not attract as many deposits 
as forecast, the government will have to come up with more money to cover its 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on its own assumptions, the White House estimated that the Treasury 
will have to fork over $39.9 billion during the next 10 years to finance the 
bailout. That's money that taxpayers must pay, either through higher taxes or 
by reduced spending on other government programs. The rest of the cash is 
supposed to come from banking and thrift industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
Many critics, questioning the White House assumptions, have challenged the Bush 
estimates as inadequate. They're probably right. That's a problem federal 
budget planners will have to face. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What will the money be spent on? 
</P>
<P>
A: Last year, when the federal government took over more than 200 failed 
thrifts, there was not enough money in the federal insurance fund to pay off 
all their depositors. So the government issued huge promissory notes and handed 
out billions in tax breaks to lure outside investors into taking the 
institutions off its hands. Although the government has not disclosed details 
of most of those deals, it estimates the net cost of all of them at about $40 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Another $50 billion is required over the next three years, the Administration 
believes, to take over more than 350 S&amp;Ls that are currently operating even 
though they are insolvent, which means that their assets are worth less than 
their liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where will the money come from? 
</P>
<P>
A: Surviving thrifts would keep paying into the existing deposit insurance fund 
to help finance past and future expenses, and their premiums are supposed to 
increase as well. Some additional asset sales would also raise money. 
</P>
<P>
But over the next 10 years, the White House estimates, taxpayers will have to 
contribute $37.9 billion, primarily to meet the cost of last year's bailouts, 
to keep the federal savings insurance fund intact. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But what about the additional $50 billion the Administration says it needs 
to raise? 
</P>
<P>
A: That will cost taxpayers an additional $22 billion in the next 10 years. But 
getting there is complicated. 
</P>
<P>
The government plans on issuing $50 billion in special bonds over the next 
three years to finance the bailouts of the remaining insolvent thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
To pay off the $50 billion when the bonds come due in 30 years, the government 
would buy "zero-coupon" bonds. Those bonds, which pay interest only in a lump 
sum when they mature, would require an up-front payment from the thrift 
industry of about $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody would also have to pay the annual interest on the $50 billion in bonds 
-- about $3.8 billion a year, according to the Treasury's optimistic estimate. 
Some of the money is supposed to come from selling the assets of the bankrupt 
S&amp;Ls. Some would come from the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which earn 
interest on the money that all S&amp;Ls are required to keep on deposit there. 
The rest would be paid by the Treasury -- that is, by the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Over the first 10 years, total interest is estimated at $36.4 billion, of which 
taxpayers are expected to pay $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: That sounds like a total cost to taxpayers of $59.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A: That's right. But at the same time, about $20 billion in higher deposit 
insurance premiums would be collected from banks as part of the bailout 
package. Because that money flows into government coffers, helping to generate 
offsetting receipts, it reduces net federal outlays. That is supposed to leave 
a bottom line to taxpayers of $39.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So where do the higher figures come from? 
</P>
<P>
A: They're all based on various estimates of how much interest the government 
will have to pay to finance the cost of covering the losses at thrifts that 
have already gone under, those that are insolvent today and those that might 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
Over 33 years, because of interest expenses, the Bush Administration estimates 
total outlays at $175.4 billion. Of that total, taxpayers would have to pay 
$94.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But has the Bush Administration, in presenting a $90-billion estimate for 
the bailout, been misleading the public about its full cost? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not really. The losses at insolvent thrifts, according to the 
Administration's best estimates, won't exceed $90 billion. That's money they 
know is gone. It was lost by thrifts on bad loans and wasted investments, 
mostly because oil prices unexpectedly collapsed in the early 1980s, bringing 
down with them a host of real estate and energy projects that had been built on 
hopes that ever-rising oil prices would generate more wealth in Texas and other 
Southwestern energy states. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also widespread fraud and dangerous risk-taking as well, as 
fast-buck operators took advantage of financial deregulation to pour money into 
speculative ventures across the country. Since Congress has promised to 
guarantee deposits at banks and S&amp;Ls to protect the nation's financial 
system against collapse, it's the job of the federal government to cover those 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why not pay all the costs now? 
</P>
<P>
A: In effect, the government is taking out a mortgage on the bailout. Consider 
a homeowner who buys a $200,000 house. Few home buyers have $200,000 in cash. 
Typically, the buyer might make a $40,000 down payment and finance the rest of 
the purchase by borrowing $160,000. If all the interest costs were added up 
over 30 years, they would total much more than the purchase price. But few 
homeowners worry about that. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the government doesn't have $90 billion in extra cash. If it tried to pay 
off all the depositors out of its current proceeds, it would have to decimate 
existing federal programs or drastically boost taxes for one year, probably 
plunging the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What will the financing scheme add to the cost? 
</P>
<P>
A: About $22 billion in real extra costs. The interest payments will be spread 
over the next 30 years. Government officials, like business managers who also 
must finance certain capital investments, rely on a calculation called "present 
value" to determine what it would cost in today's dollars to finance an 
expenditure over time. Because money spent in the future is worth less than 
money spent today, that calculation best represents the full cost of any 
financing plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration's estimate of the "present value" of its 30-year, 
$175.4-billion spending plan is $111.7 billion in 1989 dollars, or roughly $22 
billion more than paying the $90 billion immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers make relatively more of their $94.1-billion contribution toward 
the end of the 33-year period. So the present value of their share of the bill 
is only $26.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Could it get worse? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sure. The worst case has been offered by House Banking Committee Chairman 
Henry B. Gonzalez. Utilizing much more pessimistic assumptions than the 
Administration, he came up with a total cost of $335 billion by adding up all 
past and projected future expenses on S&amp;Ls over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
He forecast that the government would collect $152 billion from various 
sources, leaving the Treasury with $183 billion in expenses that would have to 
be paid out of taxpayers' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why shouldn't the government simply refuse to pay? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are many valid questions that can be raised about whether the 
Administration has proposed the best way to absorb the insolvent thrifts' 
losses. But the problem can't be ignored.

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: BID TO GIVE WORKERS A VOICE RUNS INTO INSIDE 
OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's top union leaders are heatedly debating several new ideas, one of 
which could fundamentally change relations between workers and their employers 
across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The most innovative proposal calls for federal or state legislation to require 
employees in almost all companies to elect members of "Worker Representation 
Committees." If adopted, it would mean that, for the first time, millions of 
workers would have a formal, if limited, voice in the way their jobs are 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
Union members do have something -- often plenty -- to say about the way they 
are treated on the job, but only 16.8% of America's work force is now 
represented by unions, down from 35.5% in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have voluntarily created their own committees of workers to get 
advice and suggestions. But most companies still are authoritarian, with the 
bosses making all decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed committees would not function as unions. Also, they would be far 
more limited in their functions than the well-established "works' councils" so 
common in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the committees would allow workers to get their views to 
management on issues ranging from job scheduling and improved productivity to 
health and safety needs, something most workers do rarely and only when invited 
by management. 
</P>
<P>
It clearly would be sensible for workers themselves to help enforce health and 
safety laws that now are so ineffectively enforced by government. Many 
companies already have worker safety committees, but most do not. And where 
they exist, they have little authority to take corrective action. 
</P>
<P>
The committees would not be a substitute for unions because they would not be 
empowered by law to negotiate wages and benefits, a basic function of unions 
since their inception. But the committees would give those who are not union 
members an understanding of the functions of unions and thus help labor 
organizing. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, arguments over the idea have raged for months in labor circles, 
particularly at several closed-door conferences called by the AFL-CIO Committee 
on the Evolution of Work headed by Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of 
the 14.5-million-member federation. 
</P>
<P>
Labor experts, including Harvard Prof. Paul Weiler and former Secretary of 
Labor Ray Marshall, gave extensive advice on how best to pursue the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue is its most enthusiastic backer, saying the committees could benefit 
all workers, increase the nation's productivity and indirectly help improve the 
deteriorating strength of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
The Workers Representation Committee plan and other proposals were expected to 
be ready for adoption last week by the 35-member AFL-CIO executive council at 
its annual meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla., until they ran into some furious 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Getting legislation creating the committees won't be easy under any 
circumstances, and it will be impossible if unions are not united behind the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
So while there was strong support within the labor federation leadership for 
the innovative idea, Donahue and his allies realized they need near-unanimity 
on it within labor to have even a chance of getting it adopted by Congress or 
some state legislatures. As a result, AFL-CIO action was delayed to allow more 
time to seek a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
However, not only was there no unanimity; some of the participants in the union 
debates angrily shouted their opposing views at times. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents vehemently maintained that the proposed Worker Representation 
Committees would be used by management as tools to fight legitimate union 
organizing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Other opponents complained that the idea would never fly, so why waste energy 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
But logic is on the side of the proponents. Exciting new ideas are essential if 
unions are to again become the vital force they once were in this nation. 
</P>
<P>
The committees alone obviously will not achieve that goal, but they could help, 
and despite the pessimists, legislation to create them should be possible in 
the near-future if a campaign is started soon. 
</P>
<P>
More and more labor experts agree that productivity can increase when workers 
and management together seek solutions to common problems. 
</P>
<P>
And political leaders always are looking for potentially popular ideas that 
could improve productivity in our increasingly competitive world, while 
avoiding tax increases and appealing to millions of workers who feel their 
talents are not appreciated by their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not all employers would fight the proposal if they bought the idea that 
the committees could be used as weapons to avoid real unions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the committees could become fertile ground for union organizers once 
workers realize there is great value in having a voice about the way they 
perform their jobs. At that point, they may also realize how little real 
influence on company policies they have using only the limited power of the 
legally required committees. 
</P>
<P>
But whether they help management avoid unions or help revive flagging union 
strength, the committees would benefit the vast majority of workers who are now 
excluded from any role in the decision making process of their employers. 
</P>
<P>
With the percentage of the work force represented by unions continuing to drop, 
union leaders should not ignore a provocative proposal that just might help the 
labor movement and would certainly benefit the vast majority of America's 
workers who are not union members.

Pickens Holds 4% of Polaroid: A lawyer for Polaroid Corp., which is facing a 
takeover bid from an investment group, said Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. 
holds 4% of the company's stock. Lawyer Frederick Schwarz told a Delaware 
chancery court hearing that the speculator held 2.9 million Polaroid shares. He 
also disclosed that arbitragers held 13 million Polaroid shares, or 18.2% of 
the company. Polaroid is the target of a $45-a-share, $2.95-billion takeover 
offer by Roy E. Disney's Burbank-based Shamrock Holdings Inc. The hearing is on 
Shamrock's motion to block Polaroid's $300-million preferred stock issue to 
Corporate Partners LP. Shamrock said the sale puts a large proportion of the 
stock of Polaroid in friendly hands in an attempt to thwart its takeover offer.

RULING MAY HELP TROUBLED HEART DRUG COMPETE; 
</P>
<P>
FDA LETS GENENTECH CALL ACTIVASE A LIFESAVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Genentech Inc., a biotechnology company whose fortunes have hinged largely on 
sales of its heart attack drug Activase, said Monday that it has won permission 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to claim that the medicine can save 
the lives of some patients. 
</P>
<P>
"With this approval, we can effectively communicate the key benefit of Activase 
-- namely, it saves lives," the company said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech previously couldn't advertise that Activase could save lives; it was 
restricted to saying that the prescription drug dissolved clots in coronary 
arteries, improved heart function and reduced the incidence of congestive heart 
failure following heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
There was little reaction on Wall Street to the FDA decision. Genentech shares 
rose 37.5 cents to close at $20.125 in moderate trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last year, shares of South San Francisco-based Genentech have traded 
for as much as $46.50. But the stock fell sharply last fall after the company 
said it was temporarily halting production of Activase, also known as TPA, due 
to a slowdown in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech sought the FDA approval for competitive reasons. With Activase 
costing $2,300 per dose, emergency room physicians have been interested in 
administering a far less expensive competing drug, Streptokinase, which the FDA 
had already acknowledged as lifesaving for some patients. 
</P>
<P>
Although sales of Activase got off to a fast start after its introduction in 
November, 1987 -- sales totaled $190 million in the first 12 months -- the pace 
soon slowed. And the company reported sharply lower 1988 net income of $20.6 
million due to a $23 million one-time charge for inventory of the drug that may 
become outdated before it is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech said the FDA decision to let it advertise Activase as lifesaving in 
some circumstances is based on data from two studies showing improved survival 
rates following heart attacks when the drug was given. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary study used by the FDA, the "Anglo-Scandinavian Study of Early 
Thrombosis," mortality was reduced by one-quarter, to 7.2% of heart attack 
patients treated with Activase within five hours, compared to a 9.8% death rate 
among patients treated with a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech said a second supporting study showed that giving Activase within 
five hours of a heart attack significantly reduced the death rate in the next 
21 days to 3.7% of the total from 6.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies, however, have also shown similar results for other competing 
drugs, such as Streptokinase, made by Hoechst AG of West Germany, and Eminase, 
produced by Beecham Group PLC of Britain. Both drugs cost about one-tenth as 
much as Activase.

WPP Buying Canadian Firm: WPP Group PLC of London said it has agreed to buy 
PARG, Public Affairs Resource Group of Toronto, one of Canada's largest public 
affairs consulting and public opinion research firms. WPP Group said the deal

over the next five years. WPP is also the parent of the J. Walter Thompson 
advertising company.

Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Monday that three of his aides had 
bought bargain shares in the company at the center of a stock-profiteering 
scandal, but he denied any personal involvement in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
"I regret my aides' purchase of shares occurred because of my poor 
supervision," Nakasone said in a nationally televised news conference. "But I 
am innocent and played no role in the scandal." 
</P>

The largest opposition party, the Socialists, expressed dissatisfaction with 
Nakasone's remarks and repeated demands the government summon him to testify

BRUCE HOROVITZ / MARKETING: HOLY TIE-IN! BATMAN BORES CONSUMERS JUST AS 
RETAILERS PREPARE FOR FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atop research firm recently asked people across America to rate their favorite 
cartoon and comic strip characters -- including Batman. But the responses were 
the kind that could drive the folks at Warner Bros. and DC Comics batty. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the film company not only plans to release a $30-million Batman 
motion picture in June, but through Warner Communications' licensing arm, more 
than 100 licensees have paid fees to manufacture Batman products that range 
from plastic car mats to thermos bottles decked with pictures of the Caped 
Crusader. Meanwhile, DC Comics also has big plans to market Batman during this, 
his 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
But in the national survey of 1,800 consumers of all ages, Batman rated a real 
dud. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the California Dancing Raisins -- who topped the list -- proved to be 
more than four times more popular than Batman. Indeed, Batman couldn't even 
muster an "average" score with consumers but rated about even with such 
snoozers as Moon Mullins, the Incredible Hulk and Beany and Cecil. Worse yet, 
Batman even fell slightly below such luminaries as Deputy Dawg, Betty Boop, and 
yes, even Chicken Little. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't buy any stock in Batman," said Steven Levitt, president of Marketing 
Evaluation Inc., the Port Washington, N.Y., research firm that conducted the 
survey. "In fact, if I had a chance to make a Batman lamp or an Alf lamp, I'd 
run like hell to Lorimar to make an Alf lamp and run the other way from 
Batman." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But don't expect these results to drive Batman back into the bat 
cave. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one licensing expert predicts that Batman accessories could post 
retail sales exceeding $150 million over the next year. And officials at Warner 
Bros. and its sister company, LCA Entertainment, say Batman still has plenty of 
fight left. In fact, they say, enthusiasm for Batman generally goes in 
seven-year cycles -- and that the latest cycle will peak about the time the 
movie starring Michael Keaton as Batman is released this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it," said Barbara Sims, director of marketing at LCA 
Entertainment. "Bat man is a long-term classic character who has his highs and 
lows. Remember, this is not a character that has a theme park named after it." 
</P>
<P>
DC Comics, which is also owned by Warner Communications, seems certain that 
Batman accessories will fly. The company has even licensed Ballantine Books to 
publish a coffee table book on Batman's history that is expected to retail for 
more than $35. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as the year when Batman has evolved from a cartoon character into 
a fashion statement," said Mary Moebus, vice president of licensing at New 
York-based DC Comics. "Batman is moving out of the trendy under-culture into 
the mass market." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Batman's new popularity with teen-agers got a lift when a member of 
the popular rock group U2 wore a Batman T-shirt in "Rattle and Hum," a 
documentary film about the group's 1987 world tour. Even the makers of the 
T-shirt were surprised because they didn't pay anything to have the shirt so 
prominently displayed in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some big retailers are climbing aboard the Batman bandwagon. Both the 
Macy's and K mart retail chains recently began to stock limited amounts of 
Batman T-shirts and sweat shirts. And very soon, Batfans will be able to 
purchase everything from Batman suspenders to Batman eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
One licensing official predicts that there'll be a big demand for Batman 
accessories. "I think the Batman movie will create a lot of interest in Batman 
merchandise," said Murray Altchuler, executive director of the New York-based 
Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But Altchuler, who once worked for LCA, where he licensed the Batman TV series, 
said the reaction may not be exactly what Warner Bros. expects. "If I was 
seeking a license for Batman, I'd be quicker to jump on board with the old 
Batman property than with the new movie." 
</P>
<P>
It seems that the Batman in the motion picture is a far different -- if not 
darker -- character than the campy Batman most people remember from the 1960s 
TV series. The two even dress very differently. The motion picture Batman is 
much like the comic book character, who wears a dark outfit, while Batman from 
the TV show wore a bright blue outfit with a flashy logo painted across his 
chest. What's more, Batman's ever-popular sidekick, Robin, doesn't even appear 
in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
That's why one computer software company has decided to create a Batman video 
game that will be modeled after the comic book series and not the new film. 
"We're riding the wave of Batmania, but we're not affiliated with the movie," 
said Jim Whims, general manager of San Jose-based Data East USA Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Next week, Data East plans to ship the $25 video game to toy chains nationwide. 
And Whims, who co-founded Worlds of Wonder, says he hopes to sell up to 60,000 
games. "When you get past the Batman name, all the player looks for is how the 
game plays," said Whims. "If it doesn't play well, it will quickly get killed." 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, some retailers are buying into both the old and new Batman 
characters. "We basically hope that consumers who don't buy one will buy the 
other," said Elizabeth Wardley, marketing services manager at Applause Inc., a 
Woodland Hills company that makes novelty items from popular TV and film 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Applause is making two completely different sets of Batman key 
chains. One set, which will be hung from a display with a dark background, 
features the Batman from the new movie. But a second set, which will be sold 
from a bright blue display, features Batman and Robin from the TV show. 
</P>
<P>
For years -- even before the motion picture was talked about -- three stores on 
Melrose Avenue have been stocking Batman accessories. Their wares, however, are 
mostly tied in to the 1960s TV show that starred Adam West. 
</P>
<P>
"Batman has been a hot item for some time," said Chuck Ware, manager of Hans 
Korthoff Antiques. "We started selling the stuff because our customers asked us 
to." Among the "antique" Batman items his store sells is a plastic Batmobile 
that sold for $15 when it was made about 20 years ago. Today, it fetches $125. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, the store Wacko has been selling Batman buttons, badges and T-shirts 
for some time. "It has nothing to do with the film," said Len Haynes, assistant 
manager at the store. "Punk and New Wave kids like the old Batman stuff." 
</P>
<P>
But the Melrose shop Chick A Boom claims to be one of the first stores in the 
country to carry a full supply of old Batman artifacts. "When we started 
stocking this stuff 10 years ago, we were nearly laughed off the planet," said 
Chris Scharfman, who owns the store. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items is a Batman talking alarm clock that originally sold for about 
$15. It now retails for $125. And if you want an original Batman wastebasket, 
well, that'll set you back $66. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a new generation of kids who are just getting into Batman," said 
Scharfman. "But the question is, will the new Batman stuff be made so shabbily 
that it won't even be collectible?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Circuit City Decides to Review Its Agency 
</P>
<P>
Is Circuit City changing its mind about which ad agency is "the intelligent 
choice?" 
</P>
<P>
The home electronics chain -- which calls itself "The Intelligent Choice" in 
its advertising -- has apparently decided that it is not completely satisfied 
with the Los Angeles ad agency, Admarketing, which created that slogan. The 
estimated $25-million account was put up for review last week, according to 
Jack Roth, president of Admarketing. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is, they said they'd talk to a few other people," said Roth, who 
added that he was surprised by the review but hopes to keep the account. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at Circuit City were tight-lipped about the move on Monday. Greg 
Jones, the City of Industry-based company's new vice president of marketing, 
declined to comment on the review. But some Los Angeles ad executives openly 
questioned why Circuit City -- which has seen its sales nearly quadruple in the 
four years Admarketing has handled the business -- would consider the agency 
change. Said Admarketing's Roth: "I guess they feel they'd be remiss if they 
didn't look at and listen to others." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Stars Just Can't Come Out for AdClub 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Orange County Advertising Federation will be the first to tell 
you that passing the age 30 has been rough. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which is also known as the AdClub, turned 31 this year. So 
executives figured that it might be fun to use "thirtysomething" as a theme to 
Friday night's awards dinner. In fact, a flashy video show prior to the awards 
presentation will feature all kinds of clips from the popular TV show. After 
all, two stars from the TV series happened to run a fictional advertising 
agency that recently bit the dust on the show. 
</P>
<P>
But the stars wouldn't come out for the AdClub. Nearly 1,000 people are 
expected to attend the banquet at the Irvine Hilton. Yet when the AdClub asked 
four different stars from the TV show to host their gala, they were turned down 
flat. "The studio said they're so far behind in filming, they couldn't tear 
them away," said Bob Guzman, executive director of the AdAwards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spots to Put New Accent on Pic'N'Save 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Spanish-language TV advertisements have positioned the Los 
Angeles discount store chain, Pic'N'Save, as a place with the lowest prices 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the discounter handed its $1-million account to the North Hollywood 
ad agency Castellanos Latina Advertising, which also handles Latino advertising 
for the Broadway. And Julio J. Castellanos Sr., president of the firm, says a 
new ad theme for the 145-store chain will begin later this year. "We want to 
show people that besides getting low prices, they also get good quality," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Firm Says No Soap to Laundromat Billboard 
</P>
<P>
It's not exactly the sort of ad you'd expect to see on a highway billboard. And 
as far as the folks at the outdoor advertising firm Patrick Media are 
concerned, you won't. 
</P>
<P>
The subject matter is pretty tame: a woman knitting a sweater and a man sipping 
coffee while seated on a bench. But there is one catch -- they're both naked. 
Well, their faces and other crucial areas are concealed by black strips. But 
even the headline on the billboard ad for the San Jose chain Oasis Laundry 
plays off their nakedness: "Some People Who Won't Appreciate Our Laundromats." 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Media, the billboard company, told the laundry no soap. "The last 
thing we need to do is get special-interest groups screaming at us," said 
Gregory Gall, account executive at Patrick Media Group's Oakland office. "We're 
losing boards every year through new ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the San Francisco ad agency that created the billboard thinks the 
brouhaha is silly. Said Cathi Mooney, chairman of Mandelbaum, Mooney &amp; 
Associates: "I've seen billboard ads for airlines that are a lot more risque 
than this."

NATIONAL SEMI SELLS COMPUTER UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
HITACHI, GM TO BUY MAINFRAME BUSINESS FOR $398 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Semiconductor Corp., the Santa Clara computer chip maker, said Monday 
that it has reached a tentative agreement to sell its mainframe computer 
business to Hitachi Ltd. and a unit of General Motors Corp. for $398 million. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said the deal was a great financial coup for National 
Semiconductor, while others noted that it gives Hitachi, Japan's fourth-largest 
computer maker, an even stronger foothold in the U.S. electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal, Hitachi would own 80% of the joint venture buying 
National Advanced Systems, National Semiconductor's mainframe computer unit. 
The remaining 20% would be owned by Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems Corp., 
the General Motors subsidiary created and later sold by H. Ross Perot. The deal 
is expected to close within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, National Semiconductor said it had reached a tentative accord to 
sell 50% of its mainframe unit to Memorex Telex NV of Amsterdam for $250 
million in cash and 4 million shares of Memorex Telex stock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ties to Hitachi 
</P>
<P>
Complications in financing the deal arose, however, and the agreement expired, 
freeing National Semiconductor to consider other offers, said George Bragg, a 
spokesman for Memorex Telex's U.S. subsidiary in Tulsa, Okla. He said Memorex 
Telex proposed other deals but could not match the all-cash offer from Hitachi 
and EDS. 
</P>
<P>
National Advanced Systems already has ties to Hitachi. It is the largest 
distributor of Hitachi's Japanese-made, IBM-compatible mainframe computers and 
data-storage systems, with operations throughout the United States and Europe. 
In its most recent fiscal year, the 2,000-employee unit had sales of $900 
million. 
</P>
<P>
However, National Semiconductor has been trying to sell its computer operations 
to concentrate its efforts on its core, chip-making operations, which have 
suffered in recent months. In December, the company announced an agreement to 
sell its DataChecker Systems unit for $90 million to a unit of STC PLC in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
"From National's standpoint, it's a very positive move," John McManus, of 
Thomas McKinnon Securities in New York, said of the proposed sale. "They get 
all the money up front. I think it's a great move." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hammons, a computer industry analyst with the Sierra Group in Tempe, Ariz., 
also said the deal was good for National Semiconductor but wondered what it 
would do with all the money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Portion to Be Sold 
</P>
<P>
"National couldn't do anything with NAS," Hammons said. "So now that they've 
gotten rid of it, the question is what are they going to do with the cash that 
they couldn't do with the company?" 
</P>
<P>
National Semiconductor spokeswoman Mary Coady said the money would go toward 
the retirement of debt and working capital. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi has said it intends to sell the European portion of the business, which 
accounts for less than half its revenue, to Comparex Information Systems GmbH 
for an undisclosed price. Comparex, based in Mannheim, West Germany, is 
Hitachi's other sales outlet for mainframe computers in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the two sales and two rounds of layoffs in the chip-making 
operations, National Semiconductor's worldwide employee count will stand at 
about 35,000. Its stock closed at $8.25 on Monday, up 12.5 cents, on the New 
York Stock Exchange.

SEC PROBES MAI OFFER FOR PRIME COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID OLMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing MAI Basic Four's hostile 
takeover offer for Prime Computer for possible violations of federal stock 
margin regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Bagner, an MAI attorney, said the Tustin computer company has had 
"informal, cordial and cooperative discussions" with the SEC regarding the 
value of the collateral MAI has pledged to finance its takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've answered all the questions the commission has asked," Bagner said 
Monday. "As we've stated before, we believe the offer complies with the margin 
rules." 
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Board rules limit the amount of unsecured debt used to back the 
purchase of stock in a takeover to 50% of the value of the target company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
MAI has said it will need to borrow $1.5 billion to complete its acquisition of 
Prime. Of that total, about $875 million will involve unsecured borrowing. MAI 
has said the 50% rule does not apply to the type of bid it has made for Prime. 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 16 letter, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said the agency was 
investigating "factual and legal questions relating to possible margin 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
Ruder was responding to letters sent earlier this month by several 
Massachusetts lawmakers, who expressed concern about SEC enforcement of the 
margin rules. Prime, a leading manufacturer of minicomputers, is headquartered 
in Natick, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In December, a federal judge in Boston blocked MAI's bid, questioning the 
"highly leveraged nature" of the deal and warning that MAI might be in 
violation of the margin requirements. 
</P>
<P>
MAI, a company controlled by New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, has offered to 
buy Prime for $20 per share in a deal that values Prime at $970 million.

More than 1,000 marchers swarmed into the New Mexico Capitol in Santa Fe to 
draw attention to an alcohol abuse problem that kills six times as many people 
in their town of Gallup than in most U.S. cities. Some of the marchers had been 
on the road for the 200 miles and 10 days since leaving Gallup, a town of 
20,000 people that borders the Navajo Indian reservation. McKinley County leads 
the nation in both drunken driving accidents and alcohol-related deaths. 
Authorities said 18 people died in McKinley County in January due to 
alcohol-related causes, such as exposure, drunken driving and drunken beatings.

A Palestinian teen-ager stabbed an Israeli soldier and then was shot and 
wounded as troops chased him through a crowded market, the army said. In 
clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded 10 
Palestinians, Arab sources said. The violence came on the eve of municipal 
elections, which the leadership of the nearly 15-month uprising has ordered 
Arabs to boycott. The military commander of the West Bank town of El Bireh, 
about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, said the Arab youth stabbed the last soldier 
in a routine patrol. As the assailant fled, two soldiers fired, hitting him in 
the head and neck. The soldier was reported to have suffered minor to moderate 
wounds.

Washington Mayor Marion Barry, grappling with a record murder rate, proposed 
legislation to mandate a five-year prison term for anyone caught carrying an 
unregistered handgun. The law, if passed by the City Council, would toughen the 
city's handgun control law, which is already among the nation's strictest. In 
the first 58 days of the year, 88 people had been murdered in Washington. Now, 
a first-time offender caught with an unregistered handgun is charged with a 
misdemeanor punishable by at most one year behind bars. City law now makes gun 
possession a felony on second offense. Barry proposed making it a felony for 
anyone to carry an unregistered handgun.

Four Merced-area people were killed when their car went around railroad 
crossing barriers and was torn in two by an Amtrak train going nearly 75 
m.p.h., the California Highway Patrol said. No one on the northbound train was 
reported injured in the Sunday evening accident at Le Grand. After a short 
delay, the train continued its trip from Bakersfield to Oakland. The Merced 
County coroner's office identified the victims as Shane Littleton, 18, Rhonda 
Carol Gideon, 21, and Walter Luke Encalade, 29, all of Merced, and Paul Ince, 
27, of Le Grand. A CHP officer said all apparently died on impact. He said a 
paper bag filled with beer cans was found at the scene.

About 500,000 women die in childbirth in Third World countries every year, 
compared to 6,000 in developed nations, the World Health Organization said. At 
the present rate, about 7 million women are expected to die in childbirth 
between now and the year 2000. WHO said that most of the deaths could be 
prevented through family planning, prenatal and other care costing about $2 per 
capita a year.

A luxury condominium on New York City's Fifth Avenue that was turned over to 
the Philippines government by an associate of deposed President Ferdinand E. 
Marcos was sold for $3.7 million. An official of the Philippine Commission on 
Good Government said the seven-bedroom apartment on the 43rd floor of the 
Olympic Towers, next to St. Patrick's Cathedral, was surrendered to the 
Philippine government in 1986 by Marcos associate Antonio Floirendo as part of 
a deal to avoid prosecution. It was among several properties allegedly owned by 
Marcos through fronts. The buyer was not identified.

The Federal Aviation Administration said it has no plans to speed up mandatory 
changes in cargo door locks on older Boeing 747s even though investigators are 
looking at a door malfunction as the most likely cause of the accident that 
killed nine people over the Pacific Ocean. The FAA last summer gave airlines up 
to two years to strengthen locks on the jets. As for Friday's accident, in 
which part of the side of a United Airlines 747 ripped off, FAA spokesman Fred 
Farrar said, "first of all, we've got to find out what happened" before issuing 
additional orders.

Americans near Clark Air Base in October, 1987, a spokesman said. The suspect, 
Reynaldo Cunanan, 25, is a member of a Marxist urban guerrilla group, according 
to Lt. Col. Amado Espino, police commander in Angeles, 50 miles north of 
Manila, where the base is located. Tech. Sgt. Herculana Manganta, Airman 1st 
Class Stephen Faust and Sgt. Randy Davis were victims of the attack. Two 
suspects were already in custody while two others were killed in a gun battle

CAN LIZ CLAIBORNE REMAIN ON TOP AFTER ITS FOUNDERS RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liz Claiborne Inc., the clothier that stormed the fashion industry in 1976 with 
its ready-to-wear designs for working women, will be challenged to maintain its 
pattern of strong earnings after its founding couple departs in June, analysts 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Liz Claiborne, which has grown from a small outfit to a 
$1-billion fashion powerhouse in the past 13 years, said Sunday that its First 
Couple -- Arthur and Elisabeth Claiborne Ortenberg -- will retire in June to 
pursue "environmental, social and other personal interests." 
</P>
<P>
The shares fell $1.125, about 6%, to $17 in over-the-counter trading Monday on 
fears for the company's future under new management, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"Liz Claiborne has been a big power in the company," said analyst Edward 
Johnson of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a question whether Liz Claiborne the company can continue the success 
of the last 10 years," added Marcia Koory at Kirkpatrick, Pettis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Healthy Posture' 
</P>
<P>
Liz Claiborne began as an upstart, private concern in the hotly contested New 
York fashion industry. Created by two locals -- Claiborne, a clothing designer 
for two decades, and husband Arthur, a textile executive -- the company boasted 
sales of $2.6 million its first fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
But even bigger success lay ahead. Claiborne's focus on clothing for 
professional women rather than high-priced evening dresses found a grateful 
market in the nation's burgeoning female work force. Annual sales had surged to 
$117 million when the company went public in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Ortenbergs said their retirement should not hurt the company's stylish 
future, despite some doubt on Wall Street about the transition. Both Claiborne, 
59, and Ortenberg, 62, will remain directors of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the company is in a very healthy posture, with strong 
management in place," the Ortenbergs said in a statement. "We are confident 
that our designers and product developers -- in all the company's divisions -- 
will perpetuate and enhance the Claiborne concept of integrity of design, 
color, quality, fit and fabric." 
</P>
<P>
"For the past few years, Liz has taken a teaching and consulting role," added 
company spokesman Sam Miller. "They (the Ortenbergs) feel they have a good 
support team." 
</P>
<P>
Miller added that the company's earnings outlook is still quite good in spite 
of the 18-month slump in the women's apparel industry. The clothier has 
recently expanded into menswear, scarfs, belts and purses to broaden its sales 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"The company sells moderately-priced designer clothes, and that's where the 
growth is going to be," Koory said. It (the company) is in a good position," 
Koory said. 
</P>
<P>
Liz Claiborne Inc. said fourth-quarter profit rose 18.4% to $26.6 million, 
compared to $22.5 million a year ago. Sales rose 21.7% to $290.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that the company will earn $1.35 to $1.45 a share in 1989, 
Miller said, versus $1.26 a share in 1988 and $1.32 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said the stock's fall will be only a short-term phenomenon, as 
the Ortenbergs' retirement should not cause major changes in the company's 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
"Their (the Ortenbergs') stock holdings are quite significant. I don't think 
they'll be afraid to give their opinion," Koory added.

FOR ATHEISTS, THERE'S NO ROOM AT THE INN FOR BIBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tradition probably began sometime in 1908, when a group of traveling 
Christian salesmen left the first Bibles in a Midwestern hotel as solace for 
other road-weary journeyers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, stocked in an estimated 95% of the nation's 2.5 million hotel and motel 
rooms, the Bible has become as much a fixture as color TV and miniature soap. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of a national atheist organization based in Madison, Wis., say the 
Good Book is one amenity they can do without. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Gruesome Bedtime Reading' 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom From Religion Foundation, a 3,000-member nonprofit group founded in 
1978, this month launched a campaign urging innkeepers across the country to 
offer "Bible-free" rooms for non-believing guests. 
</P>
<P>
In letters to more than a dozen major hotel chains, the organization charged 
that the Bible makes for "gruesome, unsavory bedtime reading" and constitutes 
an invasion of privacy for "freethinking" travelers. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone truly cannot survive without a daily dose of Scriptures, we feel 
sure they will take precautions to travel with their Bibles," said Annie Laurie 
Gaylor, editor of Freethought Today, the group's monthly newsletter. "The rest 
of us deserve a vacation from mindless religious proselytizing when we are on 
our vacations." 
</P>
<P>
Hoteliers, somewhat taken aback by such vehemence, were almost unanimous in 
their commitment to making the Bible available. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at it as a freedom of choice thing," Holiday Inn spokeswoman Kris 
Stewart said. "It's nothing that is forced on anyone. It's in a drawer. If you 
want it, it's there. If you don't, don't open the drawer." 
</P>
<P>
The Hilton Hotels Corp., which has its world headquarters in Beverly Hills, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Positive Experiences Shared 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, we have received numerous letters from guests who have shared 
with us many positive experiences . . . from reading the Bible," a spokesman 
said. "It's just up to a guest's discretion whether he wants to read it." 
</P>
<P>
The issue has raised the hackles of Christian leaders, who view the notion as 
something akin to removing the motto "In God We Trust" from U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, any place is an appropriate place for a Bible," 
said Clifford MacDonald, editor of the American Bible Society's monthly 
magazine, based in New York. Most of the Bibles found in the lodging industry 
have been donated by Gideons International, a ministry of Christian businessmen 
that traces its roots to the traveling salesmen who began spreading the Gospel 
more than 80 years ago. Based in Nashville, Tenn., the group distributes about 
700,000 Bibles annually to American hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to get the Scriptures into every room," said Gary Dunsford, 
office manager for Gideons International. "It's just to provide comfort and 
guidance for those who choose to look for that." 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of Freedom From Religion say one man's comfort may be another man's 
curse. The group is distributing bright-yellow stickers that show a skull and 
crossbones, to be placed on Bibles, reading: "Warning! Literal belief in this 
book may endanger your health and life!" 
</P>
<P>
Particularly offensive, leaders said, is the "pornographic and bloodthirsty 
language" throughout the Bible that they contend has been used by countless 
murderers and molesters to justify their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Appeal 
</P>
<P>
The foundation decided to appeal to the lodging industry when it was learned 
that some Berkeley innkeepers objected to a proposal to place "safe-sex" kits 
containing condoms in Bay Area motels. 
</P>
<P>
"These people were offended by the presence of condoms, and we thought, 'What 
could be more offensive than the presence of Bibles?' " Gaylor said. "It is an 
obscene work that has probably caused more harm than any single book." 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment was shared, in part, by a spokesman for the Council for 
Democratic and Secular Humanism, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based group that believes 
life's mysteries must be explained in human, not divine, terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, religious minorities have suffered at the hands of Christians 
who have used the Bible to justify their actions," said Tom Flynn, a 
contributing editor to the group's quarterly journal. "Innkeepers could be a 
little more sensitive to . . . their clientele who might not find the bedside 
Bible as comforting as Christian customers do." 
</P>
<P>
But rather than banish the Bible from hotels, said a spokesman for the Society 
of Biblical Literature in Denver, Colo., innkeepers might be better advised to 
offer a wider range of religious texts, including the Koran, the Talmud and 
Buddhist sutras. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Larger Drawers' 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, what we need are just larger drawers," said Kent Harold Richards, 
executive director of the predominantly academic organization. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lodging industry's biggest names have lent a sympathetic ear. 
Holiday Inn founder Kemmons Wilson, a devout Baptist, has stocked his hotel 
rooms with Bibles since their opening in 1952. John Willard Marriott, founder 
of the Marriott Hotels, was a strict Mormon. And Conrad Hilton, founder of the 
Hilton Hotels, was a Roman Catholic whose inspirational booklet, "Be My Guest," 
is placed alongside Bibles in all rooms. 
</P>
<P>
More important, some of these moguls were eager to clean up the early image of 
the roadside motel, for years considered little more than unsavory nightspots 
frequented by traveling salesmen and clandestine lovers. By offering clean, 
moderately priced accommodations in a wholesome setting, they found they could 
appeal to a broader family-oriented clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bible helped transform that image," Quality Inns spokeswoman Lynn O'Rourke 
Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
For Freedom From Religion, which is devoted primarily to promoting the 
separation of church and state, persuading the lodging industry to offer 
"Bible-free" rooms will be just another unpopular battle among many it has 
waged. 
</P>
<P>
The group, for instance, said it recently played a key role in banning pregame 
prayer at University of Wisconsin football games. However, it was unsuccessful 
in its efforts to sue former President Reagan for declaring 1983 "The Year of 
the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An 'Uphill Battle' 
</P>
<P>
"It's an uphill battle for freethinkers, no matter what we do," Gaylor said. 
"We're just happy to have a chance to try to educate." 
</P>
<P>
For many hoteliers, it is a lesson they hope lingers no longer than an 
overnight guest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a tradition that I think has stood the test of time," a Marriott Hotel 
spokesman said. "If people didn't want it, there probably wouldn't be so many 
Bibles out there."

MICHAEL CALLEN FIGHTS FOR LIFE, AND THE MEANS TO DEFEAT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR F. ZONANA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six-and-a-half years after he was found to have AIDS, Michael Callen -- author, 
activist, singer and songwriter -- half-jokingly credits his longevity to 
"luck, Classic Coke and the love of a good man." 
</P>
<P>
Friends have other ideas. They attribute Callen's survival to grit, hope and a 
refusal to bow to conventional wisdom -- the same qualities that have powered 
Callen's role as a major player in the war against acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
While some people would have AIDS patients romanticize death and "walk toward 
the light," Callen instead talks of "wrestling this beast to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
"This life is the light," he insisted this month while visiting Los Angeles. 
"If there is a heaven, this is it." 
</P>
<P>
Callen's tenacious fight for life -- his own, his friends' and those of the 
half-dozen organizations he started and nurtured -- has transformed him into a 
role model for people with AIDS and a major figure in formulating society's 
response to the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Evolving Role 
</P>
<P>
His longevity has allowed his influence to stretch from the safe-sex battles of 
the early 1980s to the AIDS "self-empowerment" movement that blossomed 
mid-decade, to the current drive to speed promising drugs to patients. 
</P>
<P>
"When the history of this epidemic is written, Michael Callen will be up there 
with the heroes," said Christopher Babick, deputy director of the People With 
AIDS Coalition in New York, where Callen lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Callen has been a role model for thousands of people, a symbol of hope 
when there was none, an AIDS advocate before there was an AIDS advocacy 
movement," added David Corkery, director of communications for the American 
Foundation for AIDS Research. 
</P>
<P>
Callen also draws praise from the mainstream. Callen's is "a voice of urgency, 
but also a voice of reason," said the Rt. Rev. Paul Moore Jr., Episcopal bishop 
of New York, who served with him for three years on the New York State AIDS 
Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
Another panel member, New York State Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod, 
credits Callen with having had "a major impact on the direction and formulation 
of public policy." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the accolades is a fresh-faced son of the Midwest who, at 33, 
looks like a cross between a GQ model and the church choirboy he once was. 
Nothing in Callen's appearance -- from the jade-green eyes that sparkle with 
intelligence to an energy level that confounds his doctors -- suggests illness. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Callen's apparent robustness has led to whispers that he really doesn't 
have AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Put Rumors to Rest 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Callen put the rumors to rest by publishing a copy of the pathology 
report of his Kaposi's sarcoma diagnosis, along with a letter from his 
physician, in People With AIDS Coalition Newsline, the monthly magazine he 
edits. 
</P>
<P>
"There are easier ways to meet Liz Taylor then by pretending you have the most 
stigmatized disease of this century," Callen said dryly, rolling up a shirt 
sleeve to display a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't help me to know only my death will prove to some people that I 
haven't been a fake all this time," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Callen's long-term survival isn't as unusual as commonly believed. A 
paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1987 found that 20.7% 
of non-intravenous drug using gay men with AIDS were still alive four years 
after diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of new drugs and better patient-management strategies, that 
percentage has likely grown. 
</P>
<P>

'Denies ... Our Survival' 
</P>
<P>
"The unthinking repetition of the notion that everyone dies from AIDS denies 
both the reality of -- and, more importantly, the possibility of -- our 
survival," Callen said. 
</P>
<P>
"If, as I suspect, there is a biologically defined will to live, it probably 
requires hope, much as the body requires oxygen. I don't say hope will 
guarantee you'll beat AIDS, but you've got to have it to be in the running." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Callen is careful not to deny the reality of death. Whenever he delivers 
the "hope speech," he adorns the stage with five empty chairs to remind the 
audience that most people do not survive as long as he has. 
</P>
<P>
It is the type of theatrical gesture that fuels occasional criticism, most from 
within the AIDS community, that Callen is a grandstander, or that he is riding 
the tragedy of AIDS to celebrityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism wounds him, though "I am learning to develop a thicker skin," he 
said. "Would people say Elie Wiesel has used the Holocaust to enhance his 
fame?" 
</P>
<P>
It is an apt comparison for, like Wiesel, Callen is driven to confront society 
with the magnitude of the tragedy that has befallen those he considers his 
people: people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stepping Over Bodies 
</P>
<P>
"Living with AIDS is like living in wartime, only in the twilight zone," he 
said in a speech last year. "A majority of your fellow citizens don't seem to 
realize there's a war going on, don't hear the bombs dropping, the shells 
whizzing past your head, don't have to step over the dead bodies of friends and 
loved ones." 
</P>
<P>
Besides a constant barrage of diseases -- Callen's illnesses have included 
cryptosporidium, Kaposi's sarcoma, shingles, thrush, herpes and, possibly, 
lymphoma -- Callen also draws flak for his outspoken championship of unpopular 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, for example, barely a year after AIDS was first recognized, Callen 
helped shock the gay community out of complacency with a toughly worded 
denunciation of the fast-lane life styles of some gay men. 
</P>
<P>
"Denial will continue to kill us until we begin the difficult task of changing 
the ways in which we have sex," Callen and a co-author argued in a landmark New 
York Native article. The piece, "We Know Who We Are," won Callen few friends, 
but it paved the way for the safe-sex movement that has saved thousands of 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ideas Were Radical 
</P>
<P>
When the Native refused to publish further articles, Callen and his physician, 
Dr. Joseph Sonnabend, and two others wrote a pamphlet titled "How to Have Sex 
in an Epidemic: One Approach." It proposed the then-radical ideas of using 
condoms and avoiding exchanges of semen and blood, and was financed with 
Callen's tax return. 
</P>
<P>
Callen was also a leading intellectual force behind the AIDS "self-empowerment" 
movement, whose guidelines he co-authored in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"We condemn attempts to label us as 'victims,' which implies defeat, and we are 
only occasionally 'patients,' which implies passivity, helplessness and 
dependence upon the care of others. We are 'people with AIDS,' " the guidelines 
declare. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Callen has been a leader in the crusade for faster and wider 
access to promising anti-AIDS drugs. He co-founded New York's PWA Health Group, 
the first of a network of buyers' clubs for "underground" remedies. The clubs 
helped prod the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to relax regulations against 
importing medicine for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reshaping Ethics 
</P>
<P>
Callen and another man with AIDS, Tom Hannan, also started the Community 
Research Initiative, a grass-roots group of people with AIDS and their doctors 
who are conducting clinical drug trials. The group is helping to reshape the 
ethics of drug trials by, for example, testing drugs at varying doses and 
against one another, rather than against placebos. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect his thinking enormously," said Dr. Mathilde Krim, founding chair of 
the American Foundation for AIDS Research and a former member of the Community 
Research Initiative's governing board, which Callen chairs. 
</P>
<P>
With his mentor, Sonnabend, Callen has also been a strong and early voice 
calling for the routine administration of drugs to prevent rather than simply 
to treat the most common complications of AIDS. He attributes his own long 
survival in part to such a regimen. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of holding out for a Nobel Prize, the first question researchers ought 
to have pursued was this: What is the No. 1 killer of people with AIDS, and 
what can be done to prevent it?" Callen declared in a speech last year to 
federal health officials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vindication, Again 
</P>
<P>
Again, Callen's views are being vindicated. Last month, the FDA embraced 
Callen's call for routine use of aerosol pentamidime in people with weakened 
immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
The agency acted after a study demonstrated the drug is highly effective in 
preventing pneumocystis carinii, which kills most AIDS sufferers. Doctors 
predict that widespread use of the drug will change the face of the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
Callen propagates his views in speeches and TV interviews across the country; 
in Newsline, the magazine he founded to break down isolation among people with 
AIDS; and in two books he has edited: "Surviving and Thriving With AIDS," 
Volumes 1 and 2. (He just signed a contract to write a third book for Harper 
&amp; Row.) 
</P>
<P>
"Michael types faster than most people can think," said Richard Dworkin, 
Callen's lover of six years. But then, he added, Callen does everything "at an 
intense pace. It's like he's trying to cram a lifetime into a day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drummer and Lover 
</P>
<P>
The pair met when Callen, his illness newly diagnosed, placed an ad seeking 
musicians for a rock band. Dworkin became Callen's drummer -- and his lover. 
</P>
<P>
"He was smart. He could cook. He could sing. And he had a lot of books," 
Dworkin recalled. "My thinking was that he would die pretty soon, in which case 
we'd have some time together, or that he'd recover." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel so lucky Richard was crazy enough to fall in love with me when I was 
'damaged merchandise,' " Callen said. "I feel compelled to get the message out: 
AIDS is not an excuse to give up on love." 
</P>
<P>
The medium for that message is his music. His new album, "Purple Heart," is 
about love and life in the age of AIDS. He sang his trademark ballad, "Love 
Don't Need a Reason," at a fund-raiser this month for the AIDS advocacy group 
Being Alive in Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 Love don't need a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Love's never a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is all we have for now. 
</P>
<P>
 What we don't have is time. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good singer before his diagnosis, but after it he became great," said 
Marsha Malamet, who co-wrote the song with Callen and singer Peter Allen. 
"There was a complete abandonment of inhibition and fear." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Share the Wealth' 
</P>
<P>
Callen's espousal of "The Healing Power of Love" (another song he co-authored) 
led him to yet another endeavor: the creation of monthly "singles teas" for 
people with AIDS in New York. The teas, sponsored by the People With AIDS 
Coalition, draw several hundred people, and dozens of matches have resulted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my attempt to share the wealth," he said. "Rich hates it when I say this, 
but there have been dark and difficult times when I am reasonably certain I 
would not have survived without his love." 
</P>
<P>
Callen's vigorous championing of love reflects the passion of a recent convert. 
Until his diagnosis, he said, he was afraid of intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
"What I picked up from society while I was growing up was that male homosexuals 
were wildly promiscuous, lonely, unable to sustain relationships, effeminate 
and vaguely criminal -- so I was." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had No Role Models 
</P>
<P>
Callen said he now realizes that "my choices were circumscribed by homophobia. 
There were no positive role models. It's not as if I could have gone up to some 
cute guy in high school and asked him out on a date. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion of gay people being proud of who they were, of organizing around it 
politically and fighting back, that concept didn't reach me" in Hamilton, Ohio, 
where he grew up as the son of an auto worker and a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
Callen began coming to terms with his homosexuality as a student at Boston 
University. His discovery that society was "wrong about gay people" has fueled 
his skepticism about other perceived truths. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is the belief that AIDS is invariably fatal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking at Death 
</P>
<P>
"I don't deny that people die. I don't deny that at some point, you want to 
help people die with dignity and grace. It is just that some would have us 
start that process much too early. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, there is a point in AIDS -- I've seen it again and again -- where the 
spirit lets go. And that's OK. . . . I don't pretend to know how I would be if 
that time came." 
</P>
<P>
Callen, with Sonnabend, also doubts the widely accepted hypothesis that the 
human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is the cause of AIDS. While the 
circumstantial evidence for it is strong, and almost the entire scientific 
establishment believes that HIV causes AIDS, Callen argues that "science is not 
a democracy." 
</P>
<P>
"Belief that HIV has been proven to be 'the cause' of AIDS has many of the 
characteristics of religion: As 'revealed truth,' it is not wholly rational but 
emotionally reassuring and certainly influential," he wrote recently. 
</P>
<P>
Callen admits to having a vested interest in keeping the debate alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I am apparently an HIV factory," he said. A recent stomach biopsy revealed 
some of the highest levels of viral activity ever found. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the secret to survival," he mused, "is not to believe in HIV."

STUDY FINDS OILS CAUSE RAPID CONDOM FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A wide range of lubricants commonly used in conjunction with condoms -- 
including Wesson oil, Nivea hand cream, Vaseline Intensive Care lotion and baby 
oil -- can cause the contraceptives to break within 60 seconds after they are 
applied, far more quickly than researchers had believed, a new study has found. 
</P>
<P>
And one of the principal investigators in the Los Angeles-based research 
contends that packaging directions for dozens of products ignore the potential 
damage that can be done to condoms or dismiss it in vaguely worded precautions. 
</P>
<P>
The missing or misleading package warnings, asserted Bruce Voeller, president 
of the Mariposa Foundation sex research organization, may lead people to rely 
on lubricants that can cause nearly immediate condom failure, even though users 
mistakenly believe that the lubricants in question are water-based, and 
therefore safe. 
</P>
<P>
The result, said Voeller and UCLA researcher Ann Coulson, is that, as shown in 
various studies, 50% to more than 90% of condom users may be relying on 
lubricants that will cause condom failure less than one minute after 
application. A survey of nearly 1,300 men, for instance, found that Vaseline 
Intensive Care lotion was used by 61% of the respondents. Baby oil was chosen 
by more than half of the men in a similar British study. 
</P>
<P>
Of 25 men questioned extensively for the new study, Voeller said, 23 said they 
relied on Vaseline, Nivea or Johnson &amp; Johnson's baby oil -- not knowing 
that all three products quickly cause condoms to break down. 
</P>
<P>
Safe lubricants, Voeller said, include water-based preparations such as KY 
Jelly, as well as generic contraceptive gels that contain the spermicide 
nonoxynol-9. 
</P>
<P>
The mistaken impressions about lubricants, Voeller said, are facilitated by the 
ease with which many oil-based products can be washed from the skin with soap 
and water. A report of the new research is in the current issue of the journal 
Contraception. 
</P>
<P>
"Use of such oils poses clear danger to those employing condoms for 
contraception or the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including 
AIDS," the researchers said. "This observation is of importance because of the 
increasing emphasis placed upon (the use of contraceptive gels as lubricants 
capable of fighting AIDS) in AIDS prevention recommendations, such as those of 
(Surgeon General C. Everett Koop)." 
</P>
<P>
The observation about the quickness of condom failure in the presence of 
oil-based lubricants is the latest development in research that has recently 
shown that such products can be responsible for the breakdown of latex rubber 
in condoms during intercourse. Condom failure caused by lubricant damage, 
Voeller and other experts have warned within the last year, can expose people 
to high risks of infection with sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Voeller said latex condoms exposed to oil-based lubricants suffer "very, very 
rapid deterioration." Some studies show that the majority of sexual encounters 
last an average of about two minutes -- the breakdown of condoms is so quick 
that failure can occur even in such a brief moment of intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
The research was based on studies of condom users who had experienced frequent 
breakage of prophylactics, as well as on laboratory tests in which condoms were 
coated with a variety of lubricants and inflated with nitrogen to test 
pressures at which they would burst. 
</P>
<P>
Voeller said that the study confirmed that all products that contain mineral 
oil -- including baby oil and regular Vaseline petroleum jelly -- are equally 
harmful. But the study, Voeller said, also found that vegetable-based cooking 
oils -- including Mazzola and Wesson oils, as well as olive oil, safflower oil, 
Crisco, butter and even extra virgin olive oil -- are just as dangerous.

ECONOMIC CRISIS LEAVES POOR HUNGRY, DESPERATE IN PERU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LIMA, Peru 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 6 a.m., a Sunday, still dark and chilly on the coastal desert plain. But 
food lines are already forming outside bread shops and people's markets across 
the Peruvian capital. 
</P>
<P>
A bakery opens in the Pueblo Libre (Free People) district, a treeless swath of 
older, tidy brick homes owned by teachers and technicians alongside the flimsy 
grass-and-reed shacks of newly arrived squatters from the Andes highlands. A 
line forms, the people oblivious to the stench of garbage from the dusty edges 
of Tomas Valle Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The middle class and the poor mingle in the line, sharing a reality that over 
the past six months has taken hold everywhere but in the handful of well-to-do 
sections of this city of 6.1 million people: More often than not, if you want 
something in Lima, you have to wait in line for it, if it is available at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic crisis is drowning us," Guillermo Torres Valle, one of the 
original householders in Pueblo Libre, said after buying a few bread rolls. "We 
are up to our eyes. These paquetazos (government austerity packages) are 
killing us. 
</P>
<P>
"In some areas, there are people who eat a bit of bread for breakfast, and 
again for lunch, and drink water to fill their stomachs." 
</P>
<P>
Torres Valle watched his sullen neighbors waiting in line and observed: "People 
are passive, too accepting. But there is going to come a time when things 
explode. They are going to be sacking the markets." 
</P>
<P>
Peruvians are no strangers to frustration. Governments have been breaking 
promises here since the Spanish conquered the ruthlessly efficient Inca empire 
more than four centuries ago. Public buses are a trial for commuters trying to 
get home to the slums, and bank transactions can take hours. Patience is not 
just a virtue but a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
But an economic program gone wrong is indeed straining the traditional 
resilience of Peruvians, who endured inflation of nearly 2,000% last year. 
Medical supplies are often unavailable, even for those with money. Strikes by 
hundreds of thousands of workers turn routine chores into daylong ventures. One 
of the longest lines is outside the passport office -- people who want to flee 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a coup have eased once again, and President Alan Garcia, his 
popularity in tatters, maintains that he is on the verge of righting the 
economy after a spending spree that lasted nearly four years and almost 
bankrupted the country. 
</P>
<P>
The hardships, his government says, are the necessary result of a series of 
reforms imposed since September. They include the near-elimination of 
government subsidies, a move that has more than doubled the price of fuel and 
some staple foods since September. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of food for the future of democracy in Peru has not escaped the 
surging Maoist guerrilla movement, Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path. Earlier 
this month, the guerrillas exhorted dozens of shantytown residents to carry out 
an illegal potato harvest on a private farm on the outskirts of Lima -- and 
killed a guard who tried to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Peruvians of all classes share a pervasive despair -- and try 
to cope. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell your people that we are dying of hunger here," a young man shouted to a 
foreign reporter as a food line inched forward in Trebol, an old section in the 
city's north. After buying his rice, the man, Andres Villanueva, elaborated: 
"The people are getting desperate. Communism is growing stronger in these poor 
areas. It is very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shortage of Staple 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people had gathered at dawn outside the Trebol people's market, 
without even knowing whether there would be any rice, a Peruvian staple. 
</P>
<P>
Every Saturday, usually by mid-morning, a government truck arrives at each 
market and dumps a load of one-kilo bags of rice (2.2 pounds each) at the curb 
to be sold by municipal workers. On Sundays, the chances that a truck will 
arrive are only 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
On this Sunday, the people were fortunate. A truck appeared at 10 a.m. and 
deposited 3,000 bags, enough rice for 600 families. The workers sold each 
customer up to five bags for 375 intis each (about 25 cents). Schoolteachers 
are paid about $25 a month. 
</P>
<P>
In Jesus Maria, an older Spanish colonial section of Lima north of the downtown 
area near decaying Inca ruins, tension infused a rice line that stretched 
around a block of closed shops. 
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, the supply had run out before half of the people were served, 
setting off scuffles that came close to being a riot. 
</P>
<P>
Women in the line, their faces taut with anxiety and their eyes hawkishly 
attentive, kept a lookout for any sign of cheating or cutting in. Several 
people, many with relatives in the line, formed a semicircle around the pile of 
rice bags on the sidewalk to monitor the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't sell five bags, sell four!" one woman shouted. "There isn't enough!" 
</P>
<P>
The government worker in charge, nervous that the sale would collapse in chaos, 
vainly pleaded with the people to move back. 
</P>
<P>
Segundo Perez, who works as a technician in a pharmaceutical laboratory, was 
able to buy his five kilos of rice on his second day of trying. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived yesterday at 6 a.m., there were already 600 people in the 
line," he said. "At noon the rice ran out, and people were furious." 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 47, said his family of seven needs 1.5 kilos of rice a day, "so this 
lasts us three days. Then we have to use pasta or something else for the rest 
of the week. And pasta is terribly expensive," the equivalent of nearly $1 a 
kilo. 
</P>
<P>
Perez earns 90,000 intis a month, the equivalent of about $75, far more than 
most Peruvians. He takes on odd jobs, such as house painting and welding, in 
order to get by. In the past six months, he said, "my buying power has fallen 
50%. We usually cannot eat meat or chicken or fish. We are up against the wall, 
with a sword pointed at our bellies." 
</P>
<P>
Fermin Saladeriaga Arrazabal, who was running the sale, said: "The people 
finish in line and go to the end to wait again. There is a hoarding mentality, 
whether there are real shortages or not. And they know that with inflation like 
it is, they have to spend their money right away or it will be worth less. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people buy rice or powdered milk -- although we haven't sold any 
milk for weeks now -- and send their children out to the streets to resell it 
for twice the official price. And the police do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
He said there are some markets where people start lining up a day in advance. 
Lining up, he said, is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attacks by Rebels 
</P>
<P>
At one of the stalls in the adjacent market, a crowd had lined up to buy 
potatoes, which is another staple and one of the few crops Peru has managed to 
keep raising in abundance. But landslides in the Andes had cut the main highway 
to Lima, and people feared there would be a shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The sun grew fierce as noon approached, and the line of customers huddled 
against a block-long brick wall, trying to stay in the shade. 
</P>
<P>
The shortages are the result of a complex set of problems shared by other Latin 
American countries. But nowhere are they as acute as in Peru, partly because 
the guerrilla warfare frustrates what attempts there are at development. A few 
weeks ago electric power outages were routine because of attacks on power 
transmission lines. Now the blackouts have stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Food is the sorest point. Rice growers here must sell to the state rice agency, 
and they complain that they are paid too little and months late. So supplies 
dwindle. Until recently, currency-exchange rules discouraged exports, so the 
government's reserves evaporated. Rice-laden ships wait offshore until there is 
money to pay for their cargoes. Foreign lenders, unpaid for past debts, refuse 
to make new loans, so roads and transport deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Peasant rice growers in the eastern jungle around Pucallpa went on strike last 
month because they had been paid too little, or not at all, for their last five 
months of production. At a protest rally Feb. 9, police opened fire and killed 
at least 10 farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Peru literally has a shortage of money, too: A lack of paper for the presses 
that turn out currency has led to a scarcity of small-denomination bills. The 
lack of change has helped slow rice sales at the markets to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
Skilled personnel have been leaving the country, and this has caused a 
personnel shortage that seems sure to worsen. Fearful of guerrilla warfare that 
has claimed more than 12,000 lives in nine years, and worried about their 
economic future, an estimated 150,000 Peruvians left the country in 1988 -- 
three times the previous year's total. 
</P>
<P>
To survive, the poorest Peruvians sort through the garbage tossed out by the 
well-to-do. On a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a man spent his Sunday 
picking up scraps of cardboard boxes from a garbage dump near several decaying, 
abandoned former mansions of the colonial era. 
</P>
<P>
On the beach to the south, below the sand-colored cliffs and the 
upper-middle-class suburb of Miraflores, the contrast was sharply drawn: Young 
men dressed in multicolored swimwear joined in a surfing contest as organizers 
called out the results over a loudspeaker. In the Costa Verde restaurant on the 
beach, well-off people sipped cocktails under umbrellas and ordered $20 plates 
of shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the coast, in Huacho at the southern edge of Lima, the scene 
became typical again: more pueblos jovenes, or young towns, home to poor 
Indians who have migrated here from the mountains in search of a better life. 
</P>
<P>
For those in Huacho, however, even the beach has provided no respite in this 
Southern Hemisphere summer. Dozens of people, mainly children, have suffered 
burns in recent weeks from toxic chemicals dumped illegally there. The 
municipality paid for the funeral of a boy who died from such burns because his 
family did not have the money. 
</P>
<P>
The cost was the equivalent of $20.

Key presidential aides, bone-weary from a 13-hour flight home from South Korea, 
headed directly from Air Force One to the White House on Monday night for an 
emergency strategy session on how to lobby the handful of Democratic senators 
who hold the fate of John Tower's nomination as secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
And the consensus seems clear: The only hope now lies in direct appeals by 
President Bush himself, beginning today with a series of Oval Office meetings 
with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenge to Authority Cited 
</P>
<P>
"This is a fight the President has to make," not one that can be carried on by 
staff, said one key member of the lobbying team. "It's a challenge to his 
executive authority." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's pitch, a senior adviser said, will be to ask the 12 senators he plans to 
meet with to "put things in perspective, remember that this is a Cabinet 
nominee and the President is due a presumption that the person should be 
confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Bush will argue that senators need not look for clear-cut proof that all doubts 
about Tower have been resolved. Instead, the adviser said, he will say that, 
because the President has confidence in the nominee, "there should be 
overwhelming evidence of character or personal defect" for senators to vote no. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, White House aides will hunt for additional inducements that 
might keep Republicans from straying out of line or that might tempt Democrats 
to join the team. "It's pretty much arm-twisting, arm-breaking, whatever it 
takes," one senior White House aide said, although Administration staff members 
concede that on a post as important as Pentagon chief, traditional pork-barrel 
lobbying must be done delicately, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
White House lobbyists have spent most of the last five days trying to shore up 
Tower's support among the Senate's 45 Republicans. Although they acknowledge 
that at least two Republicans, Sens. Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Nancy 
Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, remain questionable, they now believe, as one put 
it, that "the groundwork has been laid" for Bush's personal appeals. In 
addition to Pressler and Kassebaum, Republican vote counters were uneasy about 
Sens. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and William L. Armstrong of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that even the President's efforts may not be enough, however, White 
House lobbyists are looking ahead to the question of how to handle failure. The 
consensus among aides now appears to be that it would be better for Bush in the 
long term to fight and lose on the Senate floor on a party-line vote than to 
back down and withdraw the controversial nomination, possibly reviving the 
"wimp" label that plagued him through the early days of his presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bush plans to begin his efforts at an 8:15 a.m. breakfast today with Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). Although Bush is not likely to 
lobby Mitchell for his vote -- White House vote counters consider the 
Democratic leader an almost certain vote against Tower -- the meeting will give 
Bush an opportunity to discuss ground rules for the Senate debate, which is 
scheduled to begin Wednesday, and to emphasize that he does not see the fight 
as a partisan battle. 
</P>
<P>
Although some White House aides have been chafing to escalate the partisan 
rhetoric over Tower, the Democrats' 55-45 control of the Senate guarantees that 
in a partisan fight Tower, and Bush, would lose. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call From Air Force One 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the rest of the day, Bush's meetings will be with senators he hopes 
to persuade. With some, he began the effort even as he flew home Monday, 
calling Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), for example, from Air Force One to ask 
him to "keep an open mind," members of the senator's staff said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Mitchell and DeConcini, Bush is expected to meet with several 
Southern and border state Democrats, including Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, John B. 
Breaux and J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Howell Heflin of Alabama, Bob 
Graham of Florida, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, Terry Sanford of North 
Carolina and Charles S. Robb of Virginia. He also is likely to meet with Sens. 
Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Daniel K. 
Inouye of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-afternoon, Bush plans to hold a Cabinet meeting. Although the meeting 
ostensibly has been called to brief Cabinet members on Bush's trip to Asia, it 
will also give the White House a chance to show Tower sitting at the 
President's side, hard at work. By late Monday, the session had not been 
scheduled to be opened for news photographs, officials said, but that could 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's meeting -- attended by White House Chief of Staff John H. 
Sununu, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas, Sen. John W. Warner 
(R-Va.), chief White House lobbyist Frederick D. McClure and Powell A. Moore, 
another longtime Republican lobbyist -- marks the end of the first phase of the 
White House battle to resurrect the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was designed to "set some priorities for the President" in the 
effort that will begin this morning, said one senior Republican operative who 
was summoned to work on the nomination fight. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the White House drive began late Wednesday as Bush aides -- 
belatedly, their critics say -- realized that the nomination was in serious 
trouble and was likely to be voted down by the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Thursday, the committee voted, 11 to 9, to recommend that the full Senate 
reject the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the White House effort has concentrated on shoring up Tower's 
support among Senate Republicans while trying to persuade at least a few 
Democrats not to take public positions before Bush could meet with them. 
McClure and Moore, working with Dole and William L. Ball III, a former White 
House lobbyist who is now secretary of the Navy, divided up the Senate 
Republicans, determining who needed to be contacted and assigning calls, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Senators Contacted 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle, Warner and Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and William 
S. Cohen (R-Me.) each have contacted several GOP senators. In addition, several 
longtime Republican operatives were called in to contact Republican senators to 
whom they have ties, reminding them of the importance of sticking with the 
President and the potential political dangers of straying from the party line. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of how pervasive Tower's influence is throughout the Bush 
Administration that two of the key players in the lobbying effort, McClure and 
Ball, are former Tower aides. 
</P>
<P>
McClure, the only black member of Bush's inner circle of aides, first came to 
Washington as an intern in 1975, then, after graduating from Texas A&amp;M, 
went to work for Tower as a legislative assistant, one of only a small number 
of blacks holding such jobs on Capitol Hill at the time. He later returned to 
Texas, went to Baylor University law school and then rejoined Tower's staff in 
1983 before going on to posts in the Justice Department and the Ronald Reagan 
White House. In 1986, he became a vice president of Texas Air Corp., where he 
was working when Bush asked him to return to Washington as head of the White 
House congressional liaison office. 
</P>
<P>
Ball joined Tower's staff in 1975 after seven years as a Navy officer. He 
served as Tower's top aide for several years before becoming assistant 
secretary of state for legislative affairs and then Reagan's top legislative 
lobbyist. He was named Navy secretary last year, a job he is expected to keep 
if Tower is confirmed.

UC BERKELEY FACULTY PANEL FINDS NO PATTERN OF ASIAN BIAS IN ADMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Some policies at UC Berkeley hurt the admissions chances of Asian-Americans 
between 1981 and 1987, but there is no clear evidence that the campus purposely 
limited the number of Asian freshmen, a faculty report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
"In our investigation, we have found nothing remotely resembling a quota on the 
admission of Asian-Americans at Berkeley. Nor have we found statistical 
evidence of any significant systematic or long-term bias against 
Asian-Americans," states a draft copy of a study by a special committee of UC 
Berkeley's Academic Senate. 
</P>
<P>
However, the draft report urges change in the use of foreign language 
achievement tests for admissions because there are no such tests in Asian 
languages. So UC Berkeley should either stop giving a boost to applicants who 
do well in European language tests or the university should develop its own 
such test for youngsters who know Asian languages, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said the eight-member committee "cannot rule out" the 
possibility of anti-Asian intent of both a 1984 policy that raised the 
necessary high school grade-point average for entrance to UC Berkeley's College 
of Letters and Science and a 1987 increase in mandatory language skills at the 
College of Environmental Design. Both policies have been changed. 
</P>
<P>
A final version of the report is to be given to the Academic Senate by the end 
of the week and may be slightly different than the draft, officials said. The 
committee chairman, anthropology professor William Shack, declined to comment 
on the report before it is formally unveiled. The Times obtained a copy of the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Asian-American admissions to UC has been politically hot since 
1984, triggering previous studies by the UC Berkeley administration and the 
state auditor general. The federal government is investigating allegations of 
anti-Asian bias at UCLA and Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights activists claim UC Berkeley and other schools designed admissions 
rules to cut back on the number of high-achieving Asian students out of fears 
that they would take the places of too many Anglo students. The new faculty 
report has not changed some minds. 
</P>
<P>
When told of the latest report's conclusions, Henry Der, executive director of 
Chinese for Affirmative Action, a San Francisco organization that has been 
active in the UC admissions field, declared: "It's a whitewash. The evidence of 
anti-Asian sentiment is staring them right in the face. . . . Maybe it's asking 
too much for a faculty subcommittee to chastise their colleagues or superiors 
publicly." 
</P>
<P>
According to the draft report, statistics show a small bias favoring Anglos 
over Asians for freshman admission between 1981 and 1987, but only between 11 
and 18 more Asian-Americans a year would have been offered entrance at UC 
Berkeley if policies had been changed. The numbers are too small to indicate 
long-term bias, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grade-Point Requirement 
</P>
<P>
Of the 22,671 undergraduates last semester at UC Berkeley, Anglo students made 
up 48.5%, Asians 26.5%, Latinos 11.1% and blacks 7%, with the remainder made up 
of other groups or people who declined to identify their ethnic background, 
according to a campus spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Under an abandoned admissions system, the College of Letters and Science at UC 
Berkeley in 1984 raised the minimum grade-point average from 3.75 to 3.9 but 
did not raise the required minimum scores on college entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Asians were more likely to be admitted by GPA and Anglos by test 
scores, Asians were comparatively disadvantaged," the faculty report states. 
However, that system of evaluating either grade-point average or entrance exams 
was dropped the following year for one that combines high school grades, test 
scores and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
A decision in 1984 to stop guaranteeing a spot at UC Berkeley to all low-income 
students who met overall UC academic standards also hurt Asians more than 
Anglos, the study says. But that cannot be proven to be anti-Asian, according 
to the committee, which was formed in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Hayashi, the campus's associate vice chancellor in charge of admissions 
and enrollment, said Monday that he had not seen the new study but that he was 
pleased with the reported conclusions of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the kind of reassurance that everyone welcomes, not only the university 
faculty and administration but the Asian community too," Hayashi said. He added 
that the admissions process is much changed and less secretive than it was in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, the state auditor general found that Anglos appeared to have 
a slightly easier time than Asians in gaining admission to UC Berkeley but 
found no pattern of discrimination. An internal campus study earlier the same 
year found no evidence of bias.

$24 MILLION OKD TO SERVE DISABLED;

<P>
FUNDING BILL TO KEEP CENTERS OPEN WINS FINAL APPROVAL 
</P>

<P>
Lawmakers broke a partisan stalemate Monday and voted final passage for a 
$24.5-million emergency funding bill to keep open the state's 21 service 
centers for 90,000 mentally retarded and developmentally disabled Californians. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, where Republicans and Democrats had bickered for two weeks 
over the best way to finance the centers, the vote was 74 to 2. Shortly 
afterward, the Senate, which already voted once in favor of the legislation, 
approved the amended bill 36 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, introduced by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), now goes to Republican 
Gov. George Deukmejian, who is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the measure came in time to allow the centers, which provide a 
variety of support services for the mentally retarded and developmentally 
disabled, to continue operating with no interruption of services, state 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials operating the centers warned earlier that they would have to begin 
closing their doors, or at least sharply reducing their services, as early as 
mid-March if the Legislature did not act. 
</P>
<P>
"We're delighted. We think it came in time to avert closures or major 
disruptions. It sure was a cliffhanger, though," said Judith Poindexter, 
executive director of the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
She and other regional center operators, as well as hundreds of mentally 
retarded people, mounted an aggressive public relations and lobbying campaign 
to win passage of the bill. They wrote letters, made telephone calls, and held 
rallies in cities throughout the state. One official predicted that the 
prolonged battle to win passage of the bill would leave scars. 
</P>
<P>
"Passage of the bill came in time to keep the centers open, but not in time to 
prevent a lot of pain and anguish by the people served by the centers. People 
who rely on the centers are less confident and more aware of the vulnerability 
of the system now," said Sandra Virago, executive director of the Assn. of 
Regional Center Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, the political battle centered not on the value of the 
services provided by the centers, but where the money would come from to keep 
them operating. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, contending that the state is broke, refused to go along with 
Deukmejian's proposal to borrow the money from a special fund. They fought for 
a long-term solution. But, with the state having only $3 million in its budget 
reserve, that could have meant a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The problem began when the federal government last year rejected a Deukmejian 
Administration application to finance the program. The state then went to court 
to appeal the decision. The Administration, confident of prevailing with its 
appeal, said money borrowed to keep the centers running would be paid back once 
the state won its case. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise calls for the Department of Developmental Services, which has an 
annual budget of nearly $1 billion and oversees programs for the mentally 
retarded, to continue funding the centers until May. At that time, the 
Deukmejian Administration will have prepared its final revenue estimates for 
the budget year. Then, if the state has the money, financing for the programs 
will come from the state general fund. If not, then the money will be borrowed 
from the motor vehicle license fund. It would be repaid in July after the state 
starts the new 1989-90 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), chairman of the Assembly Ways and 
Means Committee, cast one of the two no votes against the bill. He continued to 
insist that funding the program would jeopardize other programs because the 
state is short of cash. He called the legislation irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman William P. Baker (R-Danville), who led the fight to pass the 
bill in the Assembly, said during the floor debate that "we fully expect that 
the federal government will give us the money" to help finance the centers. 
Baker said key Democratic and Republican lawmakers reached their basic 
agreement Friday, then presented it to their colleagues Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the other house, Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) 
said Democrats did not want to go along with the compromise funding plan but 
felt they had no other choice. "We did not want to hold the developmentally 
disabled hostage because their needs are just too great," Roberti said.

DUARTE PEACE BID SPURNED BY LEFT, RIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
OFFER TO POSTPONE SALVADORAN ELECTION IS CALLED UNACCEPTABLE 
</P>

<P>
Leaders of leftist and rightist political parties Monday rejected as 
unacceptable a compromise peace proposal by President Jose Napoleon Duarte that 
would postpone a presidential election until April 30. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso of the ultra-rightist Nationalist Republican 
Alliance (Arena), who is president of the National Assembly, pointed out that 
the election has already been set for March 19 and said this date "has to be 
observed." He said that any deviation would be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Ungo, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Convergence, a 
coalition of socialist and leftist parties, said that while Duarte deserves to 
be commended for trying to find a compromise settlement in the nine-year-old 
civil war, delaying the election until April 30 would not provide time enough 
for a truly democratic vote. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Zamora, another Democratic Convergence leader, said the Duarte proposal 
"is unacceptable and does not contribute to peace." 
</P>
<P>
But he said the party will take part in the election even if it is held March 
19. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte, who had earlier opposed any delay in the election as unconstitutional, 
suggested the postponement Sunday night as his answer to a plan offered last 
month by the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
The FMLN offered to take part in the presidential election and accept the 
results if the election were postponed until Sept. 15. This proposal was later 
modified, calling for a mid-July election, and the modification was accompanied 
by a cease-fire offer. The FMLN said its 7,000 guerrillas would put down their 
weapons if the army would reduce its strength from 56,000 men to 12,000 and see 
to the punishment of military personnel guilty of human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Ungo, the Democratic Convergence candidate, said Monday that his party and the 
FMLN could not accept Duarte's call for a meeting today in Guatemala between 
government officials and guerrilla leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Other Democratic Convergence leaders said that such a meeting would require 
more time for planning. Also, they said they would not travel to a country they 
regard as under military control. 
</P>
<P>
Arena's rejection of Duarte's proposal was regarded as the more important. 
Arena is favored to win the election as it is now scheduled, and any 
postponement would have to be approved by the National Assembly. Since Arena 
controls the National Assembly, there appears to be little likelihood of this. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal Challenged 
</P>
<P>
Armando Calderon Sol, the mayor of San Salvador and an influential Arena 
leader, challenged a provision of the Duarte proposal for a national plebiscite 
if there is no agreement on his proposed delay. 
</P>
<P>
"Duarte says a plebiscite expresses the will of the people," Calderon Sol told 
reporters, "but that is exactly what this election is -- an expression of the 
people's will." 
</P>
<P>
According to some legal experts, any plebiscite dealing with elections must be 
approved by the National Assembly. And even if that obstacle could be overcome, 
Duarte did not say when a plebiscite might be scheduled or exactly what the 
people would be asked to decide. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the 
Duarte plan is "potentially the most significant opportunity ever for peace" in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Redman said that if Duarte's plan fails, it will be the responsibility of the 
FMLN, but Arena leaders and independent political observers said that Duarte's 
aim is to force the right-wing party to take the blame. 
</P>
<P>
"He passed the ball to us," an Arena official said. "We're holding the fire 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the negative reactions to Duarte's plan, it is not dead. Ungo, in 
turning down the idea of a meeting today in Guatemala, did not rule out a 
meeting on another day in another place. Nor did Arena officials, who first 
proposed a meeting with the guerrillas.

ANTI-BUSH PROTESTS FIZZLE IN KOREA;

<P>
EFFIGY IS BURNED BUT PUBLIC SHOWS LITTLE SUPPORT FOR DISSENTERS

Some students burned him in effigy, opposition leaders warned him about rising 
anti-Americanism and a dozen lawmakers boycotted his address before the 
National Assembly, but on the whole, President Bush received a positive 
reception Monday from South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
Widely anticipated street demonstrations did not materialize despite a call by 
the country's largest dissident coalition, whose leaders were swiftly taken 
into police custody when they tried to carry out a tiny protest rally at noon 
near the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Angry students at Dongkuk University burned an effigy of Bush and chanted 
anti-American slogans before trading rocks and firebombs in an encounter with 
police at the campus gate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
20,000 Riot Police 
</P>
<P>
Public support for the protests, however, was not in evidence. This may have 
had something to do with the nearly 20,000 riot police deployed in central 
Seoul, but random street interviews suggested that not many people shared the 
dissidents' scorn for Bush or for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure why they're protesting," said Kim Hak Jin, 30, a shoe company 
employee, "but I'd like to protest their protests." 
</P>
<P>
Bush stopped in Seoul for an afternoon on his way home from Beijing and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kyu Bom, 54, owner of a small textile company, said he was left with a 
"good impression" after watching a live television broadcast of the President's 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Bush delivered a tough message on free trade and reassured his hosts that the 
United States will continue to stand behind its security obligations in South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's encouraging to hear he's committed to not pulling out U.S. ground 
troops," said Lee, interviewed amid squads of marching riot police in the 
downtown Myongdong shopping district. "I see a strengthening of U.S.-Korea 
relations, in spite of the anti-American rhetoric of the younger generation." 
</P>
<P>
Students and dissidents have issued strident demands for the withdrawal of the 
43,000 U.S. troops stationed here, saying the American military presence 
obstructs the dialogue on reunification with North Korea. They also have allied 
themselves with militant farmers in opposing liberalization of South Korea's 
restricted agricultural market. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Dae Jung, among political party chiefs who conferred with 
the President after Bush's meeting with President Roh Tae Woo, expressed 
concern about anti-American sentiments and faulted the United States for a 
"lack of sincerity" in resolving problems, such as the dispute over farm 
imports, the Korea Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
"All these combine to help make youth turn its back on the United States," Kim 
reportedly told Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Universities are now in recess, which may explain why campus unrest was not 
prevalent Monday. It might also be true that the majority of students, like the 
general population, still has a soft spot for America.

"America has many faults, but it's still our best ally," said Park Jung Bai, a 
21-year-old physics major. "Students have good reasons to protest, but we 
should keep our heads cool instead of getting so emotional. We could lose an 
old friend."

CHINA SAYS IT RESENTS U.S. INVITING DISSIDENT TO DINNER, REGRETS FUSS

The government said Monday that it resents the United States having invited a 
leading dissident to a banquet given by President Bush and regrets that a fuss 
was made when police barred him from attending. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese intellectuals, meanwhile, called the action against Fang Lizhi 
"stupid," "neolithic" and "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Fang, an internationally respected astrophysicist who has criticized Marxism 
and called for democratic reform in China, was invited to the banquet along 
with his wife, Li Shuxian. But dozens of police converged to block his car and 
bar him from entering the hotel where the Texas-style barbecue was held Sunday. 
Police refused to allow him to ride to the event by taxi. 
</P>
<P>
"All the arrangements concerning President Bush's stay in China had been agreed 
upon by both sides beforehand," the official New China News Agency said, 
quoting a Foreign Ministry spokesman. "The U.S. side, without consulting the 
Chinese side, invited Fang to attend the dinner, which was especially in honor 
of Chinese leaders. Therefore, the Chinese side resented this." 
</P>
<P>
Visiting world leaders generally hold banquets for their Chinese hosts, but it 
would be unusual for them to submit the guest list for Chinese approval. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are trying to make an issue of Fang's absence, the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. "We feel sorry that such a thing should happen." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told Vice Premier Wu Xueqian at the airport that he regrets the actions 
that kept Fang away. At Bush's direction, U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord met with 
Vice Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen later and "reiterated the regret that the 
president had expressed," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Bei Dao, a poet, said he was worried that the incident could be the prelude to 
a political crackdown after a period of relative cultural freedom. "I was all 
ready to go back to my work and forget about politics," he said. "But if this 
is how they are openly interfering in human rights, then I must fight back." 
</P>
<P>
Bei is the author of a recent open letter, signed by 100 others, calling for 
the release of political prisoners. The letter echoed an earlier one, written 
by Fang in January. 
</P>
<P>
And Dai Qing, a leading journalist who attended the banquet, said she was 
shocked by the news. "Their methods are neolithic," she said. "Our government 
has changed so much for the better, it was pitiful for them to do this now."

Gunmen crashed a party at a ranch early Monday and massacred Colombia's emerald 
czar, 16 bodyguards and a friend in an attack that police said was linked to 
the brutal war for control of the world's richest emerald mines. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Molina, who had escaped three previous attempts on his life, including 
a bazooka attack on a Bogota villa, was among the 18 people killed by a band of 
about 50 uniformed attackers, Police Chief Miguel Gomez Padilla told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Although primarily an emerald dealer, Molina's name had been associated with 
drug trafficking, and he was considered a partner of Rodrigo Gonzales Gacha, 
known as "The Mexican," one of the Medellin drug-smuggling cartel's three 
alleged chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
Colombia is the world's top producer of fine emeralds, with a production 
estimated at $200 million a year, although at least half of the gems are 
illegally exported. Hundreds of people have been killed in the battle to 
control the mines.

VETERANS WON'T TAKE IT LYING DOWN -- FLAG DISPLAY IS CLOSED

For the second time in a year, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago bowed 
to an organized protest over a provocative piece of art, closing a gallery 
Monday "until the school can resolve security and safety needs." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial work includes an American Flag on the floor of the gallery 
where creations by minority students at the school went on display last week. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans' groups charged it was a desecration of the flag. "I think that a part 
of the American heritage is that the flag is to be standing upright, not lying 
on the ground," said Vietnam veteran Austin Staunton, 43, who joined about 200 
others to protest the work Monday. On the other side of a police line a similar 
number of students and sympathizers carried signs reading "anti-patriotism is 
not a crime" and shouted, "freedom from censorship." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, school and Art Institute officials outraged many museum members and 
the city's liberal community when they allowed a posse of Chicago aldermen to 
rip down a student painting depicting the late Mayor Harold Washington dressed 
only in women's lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Tyler's "What is the Proper Way to Display the American Flag?" includes a 
flag draped on the floor and a ledger for comments. For all but the most agile, 
it is necessary to step on the flag to write in the ledger. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the piece is a notice from the administration stating the exhibit is 
legal under Illinois law. It also states that to "walk on, trample, mutilate, 
deface, or defile the flag" is a felony. 
</P>
<P>
The piece was exhibited last year at a private gallery without incident. Tyler 
said the protests show, "there is not one single way to view the flag . . . 
what means freedom for some means domination and oppression for others."

Former Mayor Mike Boyle, ousted in a 1987 recall election, announced Monday 
that he will run again for the city's top job. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his candidacy, Boyle, 45, said he decided to run because he loves 
politics and public service and because a surprisingly large number of people 
urged him to enter the race. Among Boyle's opponents in the nonpartisan primary 
April 4 will be City Councilman Jim Cleary, who led the Boyle recall movement.

HIJACK SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AT TRIAL BY WITNESSES, TAPE 
</P>

As part of the case on which the United States is modeling its counterterrorism 
policy, prosecutors presented eyewitness identifications and a dramatic 
videotape Monday to show there was little doubt that Fawaz Younis of Lebanon 
helped hijack Royal Jordanian Flight 402 on June 11, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In news tapes of the 30-hour hijacking's final stop in Beirut, Younis, a 
Lebanese Shiite, emerges from the plane and reads his militia's demands that 
all Palestinians be forced to leave Lebanon. After the passengers and crew 
disembark, the plane is blown up. 
</P>
<P>
Two witnesses -- a father and his then-teen-age son who were the only Americans 
aboard the jet -- also identified Younis as the hijacker who called himself 
"Nazeeh" and who led the heavily armed five-man hijacking team. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Raises Questions 
</P>
<P>
But the testimony of Landry T. Slade, formerly an American University of Beirut 
professor, was challenged by Francis D. Carter, Younis' court-appointed 
counsel, who outlined the defense of his client and raised questions about the 
soundness of the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a model for American counterterrorism policy, the case also is 
considered a test for 1984 and 1986 statutes allowing the United States 
"long-arm" jurisdiction in terrorism incidents involving American hostages or 
aircraft overseas. Younis was arrested in an elaborate operation by U.S. 
authorities in September, 1987, aboard a luxury yacht in international waters 
off Cyprus. Younis, who looked almost preppy in a gray V-neck sweater and 
green-and-navy striped tie, faces six charges of air piracy and hostage-taking 
that could bring him a life sentence. His involvement in the incident is little 
disputed, as the tapes played by federal prosecutor Karen Morissette showed. 
</P>
<P>
But in an attempt to show that Younis' rights were violated, Carter noted that 
Slade originally identified a man who had nothing to do with the hijacking from 
a selection of FBI photos -- and missed Younis' picture altogether -- when 
first interviewed two years after the incident. Only after the FBI agent 
identified Younis' picture was Slade able to point him out, Carter said. Younis 
spent most of the time in the cockpit, out of view of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Carter hopes to prove that, in its zeal to capture its first international 
terrorist, the United States exceeded legal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Carter also noted that Younis was interrogated aboard 
a U.S. ship in the Mediterranean while suffering acute seasickness and two 
broken wrists, for which he was given only a bag of ice. 
</P>
<P>
Younis' wrists did not receive full medical attention for four days, until 
after he had signed a full confession. "You will have to determine whether the 
statement that my client gave was voluntary or involuntary," Carter told jurors 
in his opening statement. A federal appeals court earlier overturned a lower 
court decision throwing out the confession. 
</P>
<P>
Carter also questioned whether Younis, as a lower-ranking member of Lebanon's 
Shiite Amal militia, can be held responsible for an act ordered by his 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
A third point of defense is that the hijackers never intended to harm the 
Americans. Slade testified that he saw two hijackers point to the Slades as the 
two Americans on board. They then told him: "Don't worry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one was killed in the incident and none of the passengers were 
hurt, six Jordanian sky marshals were badly abused. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution spent much of the first day asking Slade and his son, William, 
about the beatings. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-examination, Carter established that Younis was not among those who 
beat the marshals. Slade conceded that Younis came out of the cockpit and 
ordered an end to the brutality.

YOUTH IS SLAIN NEAR HOME, 4 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING

A 16-year-old boy was killed near his home and four youths were wounded in a 
drive-by shooting in Paramount late Monday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The apparently gang-related shooting occurred in the 13900 block of Downey 
Avenue at about 8:20 p.m., Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
Investigators at the scene said shots were fired from a small red sports car. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard about 10 shots as I was driving up," said Jim Hughes, a drug counselor 
at a Fountain Valley hospital who was driving by on his way home at the time of 
the shooting. "I saw two guys drop right to the road. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what happens when you give these kids automatics," Hughes said. "It 
all starts with drugs." 
</P>
<P>
John Adrian Borrego was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting, his body 
lying in the gutter three doors from his home. About a dozen family members 
gathered around the body as a priest administered last rites, illuminated by 
the flood lights of television news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
"This shooting . . . has been going on for about two weeks," said a teen-age 
boy at the scene who did not wish to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was Borrego's friend and that all of the victims were members of 
"Dogpatch" a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
Four other victims were taken to area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy was in very critical condition at Charter Suburban Hospital 
in Paramount with a gunshot wound to the head and four wounds to the leg and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Three other teen-agers were hospitalized with less severe wounds.

SAN DIEGO OKS SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLE SALE BAN

The San Diego City Council, brushing aside the demands of a vociferous throng 
of gun enthusiasts and the advice of its city attorney, Monday voted 7 to 2 to 
ban the sale and possession of semiautomatic assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will not take effect for 45 days, but in a separate, unanimous 
vote, the council gave the Police Department immediate authority to seize and 
hold an assault rifle for 72 hours if the owner is suspected of using it 
illegally.

The federal government and the American Cancer Society on Monday announced a

</P>
<P>
The National Cancer Institute estimates it will spend $116.5 million on the 
project, which is being billed as "the world's largest" effort to reduce 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to begin in 1991 and run through 1998, the drive will be spearheaded 
by 20 community-based "tobacco control" coalitions in major metropolitan areas 
or throughout entire states. 
</P>
<P>
The project will include training health professionals on how to counsel 
smokers trying to stop, starting special workplace programs and beginning 
smoking prevention classes in schools.

GILLESPIE ASKS $5.4 MILLION TO IMPLEMENT PROP. 103 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has asked for authorization to 
spend $5.4 million more than budgeted for her department in the fiscal year 
ending June 30 to immediately hire 200 more employees to implement Proposition 
103, it was disclosed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Finance forwarded the request to legislative leaders 
with a notice that a review of it was not yet completed. But legislative 
sources said Gillespie would not likely have made the request without knowing 
that it would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Deficiency Request' 
</P>
<P>
Under established procedures for such so-called "deficiency requests," once 
approval comes from the Finance Department, Gillespie could begin spending the 
money unless the Legislature objects within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said she needs the funds to begin establishing a plan by which the 
Insurance Department will approve and monitor rates charged by insurance 
companies beginning next Nov. 8, according to provisions of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
Both industry and consumer groups have been suggesting in recent weeks that 
procedures must be established and personnel hired well in advance of November 
if the rate regulation system is to avoid becoming bogged down as soon as it 
goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planned $18-Million Increase 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie said in an interview last Nov. 21 that she planned to eventually add 
300 employees to her 515-member staff and increase the annual budget of $33 
million by $18 million. 
</P>
<P>
But when Gov. George Deukmejian forwarded his budget request for the next 
fiscal year to the Legislature, none of these additions were in it, and 
Gillespie explained she was waiting until later to see what would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The request revealed Monday means she wants to embark on a major part of the 
staff increases and new spending now. According to terms of Proposition 103, 
the insurance industry itself will pay for the increased Insurance Department 
budget.

A magnitude 4.2 earthquake on Monday rattled south-central Utah, and 
seismologists said the temblor was an unusual late aftershock of a larger quake 
that struck the same area a month earlier. Centered 16 miles southeast of 
Salina, the quake caused no damages or injuries, authorities said.

CITY ATTORNEY MAY TAKE ROLE IN INQUIRY INTO HOUSING UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
City Atty. James K. Hahn said Monday that his office will launch an 
investigation into the contracting practices of Los Angeles City Housing 
Authority chief Leila Gonzalez-Correa if the City Council authorizes it. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, records obtained by The Times and interviews show that the agency's 
Police Department was used on at least two occasions to investigate critics of 
Gonzalez-Correa. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Housing Authority police conducted a personal background 
investigation of a top aide to Gonzalez-Correa after he had criticized the 
handling of the agency's $1-million computer system. Gonzalez-Correa said she 
fired the administrator, Dana Stern, when the investigation disclosed that his 
California driver's license had been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
In the second incident, the agency's police contacted Patricia Tyus, one of at 
least a dozen Housing Authority tenant activists who demanded Gonzalez-Correa's 
resignation in December, 1987. Documents show that police questioned Tyus to 
determine whether she had indeed signed a petition sent to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me as extremely inappropriate," said Elaine Mallette, a Legal Aid 
Foundation attorney who lodged a formal complaint on behalf of Tyus. "What was 
really unnerving about it to me was that it was a clear intimidation tactic." 
The Times was unable to contact Tyus. 
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Housing Authority, who asked not to be named, told The Times 
that Gonzalez-Correa, who is under fire for violating federal contracting 
regulations while awarding business to her acquaintances, has used threats of 
dismissal and disciplinary action to silence her critics. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Gonzalez-Correa demanded that a deputy city attorney be 
investigated and disciplined for taking a sworn affidavit from a top Housing 
Authority administrator who had accused her of "gross mismanagement," records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Report 
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement that the city attorney's office wants to investigate the 
contracting irregularities followed a report in The Times on Friday that 
Gonzalez-Correa had steered more than $200,000 in contracts to her 
acquaintances and to Bradley supporters without soliciting competitive bids or 
seeking board approval as required by federal regulations and the agency's own 
purchasing policy. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn initially expressed an interest in investigating the contracting practices 
at a meeting Sunday with Councilman Nate Holden, said city attorney's spokesman 
Mike Qualls. Holden, who is running for mayor against Bradley, said Monday at a 
press conference that he will introduce in the City Council today a motion 
seeking a "thorough and unbiased" investigation by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Authority board members, appointed by Bradley to oversee the agency, 
appointed a committee Friday to study ways to tighten contracting regulations 
and require Gonzalez-Correa to follow the rules. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to allow the commissioners of the Housing Authority to 
investigate this action and allow theirs to be the final word," said Holden in 
seeking a city attorney's investigation. "The Housing Authority should not be 
investigating itself because this investigation must be more than a whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority police investigation and subsequent firing of computer 
specialist Stern stemmed from a dispute over the implementation of the agency's 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Behind Schedule 
</P>
<P>
At a Nov. 18 board meeting, Stern, the new management information systems 
officer, told commissioners that an implementation report had "overstated" the 
status of the software programs. Stern said that the computer system was behind 
schedule and that many of the software programs were not functioning. 
</P>
<P>
The report was filed by Marsha Hartline, who is an acquaintance of 
Gonzalez-Correa. She later went to work for the company that installed and 
services the system, she told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Stern reported that "a large number of documents relating to 
very highly sensitive negotiations had been removed from the computer's data 
banks without his knowledge or permission," according to a Housing Authority 
police report. On Nov. 24, the agency's Police Department submitted a memo to 
Police Chief Marshall Anderson disclosing that an investigation uncovered that 
Stern's driver's license had been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
Stern was fired four days later. Gonzalez-Correa said in a recent interview 
that Stern was a poor employee and the suspended license was an excuse to 
dismiss him. She said Stern's job required having a valid driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this is California," Gonzalez-Correa said. "It's not Texas. In 
Texas it wouldn't have taken me five minutes to fire him." 
</P>
<P>
Stern has hired an attorney and said he intends to file a lawsuit alleging that 
he was illegally fired for being a whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
Records in the Housing Authority told of the investigation of housing project 
activist Tyus. 
</P>
<P>
The Housing Authority police officer who contacted Tyus, Walter McKinney, is 
the same officer who investigated Stern, records show. 
</P>
<P>
"The action of Officer McKinney was clearly out of line," wrote Mallette, the 
Legal Aid attorney, in a letter to Chief Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our expectation that he will be disciplined," the letter added, "and 
that all members of the Housing Authority police will be advised that they are 
not to harass or otherwise infringe upon the rights of the residents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Following Orders 
</P>
<P>
Anderson could not be reached for comment Monday. In a brief interview, 
McKinney said Housing Authority police supervisors assigned him to contact 
Tyus. "I was ordered to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility if someone is making allegations of fraud or 
misconduct," Hahn said in an interview. "That is something that we want to take 
seriously. It's not something that we want to have swept under the rug."

D.A. TO ASK DEATH PENALTY FOR DEPUTY TIED TO DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Prosecutors said Monday that they will seek the death penalty for Rickey Samuel 
Ross, the veteran sheriff's deputy with the unblemished record who is accused 
of shooting to death three South-Central Los Angeles prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, wearing a black T-shirt and jeans, stood somberly between two sheriff's 
deputies in Los Angeles Municipal Judge David S. Milton's courtroom and said 
little during the brief proceedings. His formal arraignment on the three murder 
charges was postponed until March 10. 
</P>
<P>
Four ballistics experts have independently tied a handgun -- reportedly a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol -- found in Ross' car to bullets recovered 
from the three dead women, Deputy Dist. Atty. Harvey Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of those four states that this gun found in Mr. Ross' trunk caused the 
death of these three persons," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jay Jaffe sought the arraignment delay, saying he needed more 
time to digest the prosecution's evidence. Jaffe told reporters that even if 
the gun found in the trunk of Ross' unmarked county car was used in the 
killings, prosecutors still must prove it was Ross who fired the fatal shots. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffe earlier told The Times that Ross denied any involvement in the killings. 
The deputy will plead not guilty, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Samples of Ross' blood were taken by investigators Monday, apparently to 
compare with blood or semen stains found with the victims, Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 40, has been a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy for 18 years, most of 
the time with the narcotics unit. He grew up in South-Central Los Angeles in 
the general area where the murder victims were found. Colleagues and 
acquaintences have uniformly described him as a religious man whom no one would 
have suspected as a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
Giss said the district attorney's office will seek the death penalty. The 
prosecutor said the multiple murders constituted the "special circumstances" 
required under California law in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
During the short court appearance Ross stood with his arms folded across his 
chest, partially obscuring the design on the T-shirt, which carried a picture 
of a motorcycle and the words, "Honest, I heard them bikers talkin' about 
ridin' hogs and lookin' for chicks." 
</P>
<P>
Two Harley-Davidson motorcycles are registered to Ross, according to Department 
of Motor Vehicles records. Acquaintances said he belonged to a motorcycle club 
whose members included other law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
The only words Ross spoke in court Monday were to give his name and respond, 
"Yes, it is," when asked by the judge if it was all right to delay his 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
Ross is accused of murdering one woman each month between October and December, 
1988. The victims were identified as Judith Simpson, 27; Cynthia Walker, 35, 
and Latanya Johnson, 24. 
</P>
<P>
For his own protection, Ross had been housed alone in a cell at the Los Angeles 
Police Department headquarters at Parker Center since his arrest Thursday. 
After his court appearance Monday, he was transferred to the county's Men's 
Central Jail, operated by the Sheriff's Department, where he will also be 
housed in a solo cell without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was arrested at his home in Rialto in San Bernardino County after 
ballistics tests tied the handgun found in his car to the murder victims. A 
second gun found in the car has also undergone ballistics tests, an LAPD 
investigator said, but the results are being kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the guns after making a routine traffic stop. A prostitute who 
was with Ross told officers he had frightened her. 
</P>
<P>
Since mid-1985 there have been a series of prostitutes strangled, stabbed or 
shot in South-Central Los Angeles. While suspects have been apprehended in a 
few of the cases, dozens more are unsolved.

SEYMOUR RUNNING FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) announced Monday that he has begun a 
campaign for lieutenant governor and hopes to raise $250,000 by July 1 to 
establish himself as a credible statewide candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he has filed papers with the California secretary of state's 
office to establish an "exploratory committee" for his campaign, which he said 
will probably fizzle if he cannot meet his fund-raising goal by the middle of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
The former mayor of Anaheim said he sees the chance for a 
"senior-partner/junior-partner" relationship with Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), 
who intends to run for governor in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, who was chairman of Wilson's reelection campaign steering committee in 
1988, said he believes that Wilson would grant him more authority as lieutenant 
governor than past chief executives have allotted to their seconds in command. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a unique opportunity should Pete Wilson become governor," 
Seymour said. "We're somewhat philosophical soul mates. I could be a lieutenant 
governor who takes on specific issues and handles them for the governor." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour is the first candidate to enter the race for the GOP nomination for 
lieutenant governor. Sens. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) and Marian 
Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding have 
also expressed interest in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson said Seymour's decision "doesn't have any impact" on her plans. She 
said she is not worried by Seymour's pledge to raise $250,000 by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little early to be involved in a statewide race," she said. "I feel 
like I have an obligation to my legislative responsibilities. The potential for 
fund raising is available when and if I decide I want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, the unsuccessful Republican nominee for state controller in 1986, 
also downplayed the importance of Seymour's early start. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so far away from the election that the only people interested right now 
are the political groupies," he said. "I've run for statewide office before. I 
spent $2.5 million on name identification. I have better name-ID than anyone 
talking about running." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour, 51, is a millionaire former owner of a real estate business. He was 
elected mayor of Anaheim in 1978 and moved to the state Senate in 1982 when he 
won a special election to fill the unexpired term of Sen. John V. Briggs, who 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quickly Climbed Ladder 
</P>
<P>
Seymour quickly climbed the political ladder within the Legislature's upper 
house, winning the post of chairman of the Republican Caucus after barely a 
year in the Senate. In that job, Seymour was responsible for raising campaign 
money and coordinating strategy in GOP races. 
</P>
<P>
But after Republicans lost a key special election in 1987, Seymour was 
pressured to resign his leadership slot. He said at the time that he welcomed 
the opportunity to concentrate his energy on his own political career. 
</P>
<P>
On state policy, Seymour has long set a moderate tone. He has been a spokesman 
for more money for education and transportation. He introduced legislation to 
enable toll roads to be built in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, as Seymour pushed a bill through the Senate to ensure continued 
money for the state's regional centers for mentally retarded, a Senate 
colleague described him as a "bleeding-heart conservative." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said his work on behalf of the retarded, education interests and the 
real estate industry will give him a natural base of support that he hopes to 
build upon for his statewide race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raising Political Money 
</P>
<P>
But Seymour, who is almost unknown outside Orange County, said such 
"grass-roots" backing will mean little without the substantial sums of money it 
takes to reach voters throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The task of raising political money became more difficult last year when the 
voters passed Proposition 73, which for the first time placed limits on the 
amount individuals and businesses can contribute to candidates for state 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour said he believes that a contested primary for lieutenant governor would 
cost $1 million to $2 million. If he does not raise $250,000 by July 1, he 
said, he will "have to assess the situation." 
</P>
<P>
"If I saw the money was going to be coming in shortly, I might continue," he 
said. "If I saw there was just no way, I'd probably withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve his goal, Seymour said, he will hold perhaps eight or 10 
fund-raisers between now and June 30. He said one of the first will be a major 
Orange County event. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Orange County's Candidate' 
</P>
<P>
"I think one of my strengths as a candidate is that Orange County Republican 
support that has been so generous in supporting Republican candidates 
statewide," he said. "I'd like to go down and have a very successful 
fund-raiser there and establish that I could potentially become Orange County's 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Seymour acknowledged that claiming Orange County as a regional base would be 
more difficult if other lawmakers in the county also run. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if Sen. Campbell or Sen. Bergeson were to become a candidate for 
lieutenant governor, we would split the base down in Orange County," he said. 
"That would be unfortunate."

PIT BULL MAULS GIRL, IS KILLED BY DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pit bull dog that mauled a 2 1/2-year-old girl and then attacked her 
grandmother was shot and killed Monday by a sheriff's deputy one day after 
another pit bull was shot and killed after charging into a woman's home, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest incident, Angel Gonzales was mauled by her family's dog, 
sheriff's deputies said. Deputy David Lopez was standing near his patrol car in 
the 5400 block of Duxford Avenue in Azusa when he heard a child screaming, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez went to a nearby home and found the toddler bleeding. When the child's 
grandmother, Oralia Villareal, 44, tried to tether the dog, she also was 
attacked. The officer fired six times, killing the pit bull. 
</P>
<P>
The child was hospitalized in fair condition with severe bites on both her 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday afternoon, a Los Angeles police sergeant shot and killed a pit bull 
that mauled another dog inside a West Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, who was not identified, called police and reported that the dog had 
entered through an open door and was mauling her German shepherd, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The pit bull charged officers when they arrived at the home on Deerlick Drive 
and Sgt. Bob Rebhan killed it with a shotgun blast, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
The German shepherd was in critical condition at an animal hospital. Neighbors 
told police they had seen the pit bull roaming wild in nearby hills.

R&amp;B SINGER AL SURE IS ARRESTED IN RAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noted rhythm and blues singer Al B. Sure has been arrested in the rape of a 
woman in West Hollywood, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, 21, was arrested Saturday morning by Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies at the Mondrian Hotel on Sunset Boulevard and booked on suspicion of 
rape, said Deputy Pat Hunter. Sure, whose real name is Albert Brown, posted 
$15,000 bail and was released Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victim was a woman Sure was dating, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, a native of Boston, was nominated for a Grammy this year as best male 
rhythm and blues vocalist. His album "In Effect Mode" sold 1 million copies 
last year and his first single, "Nite and Day," made the top 10 on the pop 
chart.

BRAIN SURGERY PATIENT IS IDENTIFIED BY FRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost two months after he was dropped off at UCI Medical Center with a 
potentially fatal brain condition, a Mexican national has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
Verijlio Palacio Vasquez, 26, who underwent brain surgery Feb. 20, was 
identified by a friend who saw his photograph in Rumores, a Spanish-language 
newspaper in Santa Ana, and contacted the hospital, according to spokeswoman 
Fran Tardiff. 
</P>
<P>
Palacio was reported in good condition Monday, recovering from surgery to 
correct an aneurysm, a weakened blood vessel that, without treatment, can 
rupture, causing disabling injury or death, said officials for the medical 
center in the City of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we know who he is," Tardiff said. "The friends who recognized him 
have also notified his parents in Guerrero, Mexico. As far as we know, he 
doesn't have any relatives here." 
</P>
<P>
Palacio, who apparently cannot read or write and cannot speak because of a 
tracheotomy, remained unidentified for 6 weeks after a woman brought him, 
unconscious, to the hospital and then left. He communicated by nodding "yes" or 
"no" to questions asked in Spanish, indicating that he was in the country 
illegally. Hospital workers read names of Mexican communities to him in hopes 
that he might identify his hometown, but he did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palacio is no longer in the intensive care unit, he is still not able 
to speak. But Tardiff described him as "alert and in good spirits." She could 
not say when he will be able to breathe unassisted or be discharged from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
UCI officials speculated that Palacio's friends stayed away so long out of fear 
that he or they might be turned over to immigration authorities.

TRAFFIC STOP NETS MILLIONS IN COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bell-Cudahy police officers who stopped a car for having an expired license tag 
discovered $21.5 million worth of cocaine in the trunk and arrested the driver, 
authorities announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a standard, routine stop," Detective Hector Camacho said. "But 
this guy was really, really nervous and became evasive." 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested Byron Ottoniel Samayoa, 28, of Norwalk on Saturday morning 
after the search of the 1977 Oldsmobile he was driving uncovered a large 
leather suitcase containing 56 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in cellophane and 
black electrical tape, Camacho said. The packages had markings suggesting that 
the cocaine had been handled by a Central American drug trafficking network, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Samayoa, a Guatemalan national, is being held without bail at the request of 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Camacho said. He is scheduled 
to be arraigned Wednesday on drug trafficking charges in Huntington Park 
Municipal Court.

SUSPECT IN SHOPLIFTING FLEES; CAR DRAGS GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shoplifter who was handcuffed by a store security guard escaped Monday by 
jumping into a waiting car, which drove away dragging the guard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The guard, who was slightly injured but did not require medical attention, 
followed the suspect to the parking lot of the Fedco store at 3030 Harbor Blvd. 
on Monday afternoon, according to Costa Mesa Police Lt. Sam Cordiro. 
</P>
<P>
The guard was attempting to arrest the suspect, who is believed to have stolen 
a $44 drill, when the man climbed into a Volkswagen Beetle. An accomplice drove 
away, dragging the guard for about 75 feet, Cordiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Security agents at the store spotted the man because he was wearing a blue 
parka-style coat on the warm afternoon, Cordiro said. Shoplifters commonly use 
such coats to conceal stolen goods, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as a white male with a brown handlebar mustache. He 
is 25 to 30 years old, 5 foot, 11 inches tall and weighs 170 pounds.

THIERBACH CAMPAIGN'S DEFEAT TO BE DISSECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Latino Democrats will meet Saturday to discuss the reasons why Democrat 
Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach lost to Republican Curt Pringle in last fall's 
72nd Assembly District election. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who will attempt to explain the loss despite stronger Democratic 
registration will be Bill Mack, an aide to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Thierbach outspent Pringle, of Garden Grove, by about $70,000 in the 
$1.9-million battle that he ultimately lost by fewer than 900 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be at 10 a.m. at 250 E. Cypress St., Anaheim.

COMMUNICATION LAPSE CLAIMED IN BODY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials said the body of a man shot Jan. 29 by police remained 
unclaimed at the morgue Monday because of an apparent lack of communication. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Sheriff-Coroner's Department, said that 
the Gonzales family of Garden Grove was contacted Saturday and informed that 
the body of Dennis Paul Gonzales could be claimed for burial or cremation. But 
as of Monday evening, it had not been removed. The Gonzaleses could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' mother, Dolores Gonzales, said last week that she and another son had 
left numerous phone messages at the coroner's office, trying to find out why 
the body was being kept there. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Deputy Coroner Richard McAnally said Monday, "There was some kind of 
miscommunication between the family and I don't know who." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, 20, was shot to death when he allegedly threatened Garden Grove 
police who responded to a disturbance call at the house of a friend of 
Gonzales. The gun that Gonzales allegedly brandished turned out to be a toy, 
authorities said. The case is under investigation by the district attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said a hold is placed on the bodies of shooting victims, and the families 
are notified when the bodies may be released to a mortuary. Olson added that 
the department would verify that all procedures were followed in this case.

FUNERAL HOME HAS ITS LICENSE REVOKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state board Monday revoked the license of Lamb Funeral Home of Pasadena, 
whose operators are awaiting trial on dozens of felonies, including improperly 
cremating bodies and diverting earnings from prearranged funeral trust 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The state Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers in Sacramento said the 
revocation, which becomes effective March 30, is the result of a stipulated 
agreement under which Lawrence Lamb, who holds the license, agreed to a 
voluntary revocation. 
</P>
<P>
But the board announced that it had issued a new license, subject to stringent 
conditions, to the Lamb Management Co., which is owned by Lawrence Lamb's sons, 
Bruce and Kirk Lamb, who had no involvement in the previous operation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the restrictions are that former operators of the business, Lawrence 
Lamb's daughter, Laurieanne Lamb Sconce; her husband, Jerry Sconce, and their 
son, David Sconce, have no relationship with the new business, to be known as 
Pasadena Funeral Home. 
</P>
<P>
The Sconces are awaiting trial in Pasadena Superior Court on nearly 70 
felonies, including selling parts of 26 bodies for research without permission 
of the next-of-kin. David Sconce additionally faces charges of soliciting the 
murder of the former prosecutor in the case.

THREE AIDES OF MINKOW SENTENCED FOR FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former weightlifter -- who Barry Minkow said threatened and beat him into 
staging an elaborate fraud at his ZZZZ Best Carpet Cleaning Co. -- was 
sentenced Monday to three years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Krowpman, who claimed he was just another of Minkow's victims, also was 
ordered to serve five years probation and pay a $5,000 fine for helping 
generate a series of fraudulent financial documents that helped carry off the 
multimillion-dollar swindle. 
</P>
<P>
"I never meant to hurt anyone," he told U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian. 
"If I'd have known what was going on, I'd have never been involved. Never. . . 
. You heard a lot of bad things about me, but they weren't true." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Sentences 
</P>
<P>
An accountant who demanded a bribe to conceal the ZZZZ Best swindle from 
lawyers and auditors, Norman Rothberg, was sentenced to one year in prison, and 
a third player in the ZZZZ Best fraud, Edward M. Krivda, was ordered to serve 
60 days in a halfway house and contribute 300 hours of community service for 
making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Minkow, 22, who was convicted on 57 counts of fraud for swindling banks, 
investors and customers out of at least $26 million by staging a series of 
phony insurance restoration jobs, is scheduled to be sentenced March 13. 
</P>
<P>
Krowpman went into business with Minkow after the two men met while working out 
at a San Fernando Valley gym. He was the man who, Minkow said, initially beat 
him and threatened him into making huge interest payments on the money he put 
into the company. At one point, Minkow testified, Krowpman attempted to rape 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Both prosecutors and the judge discounted Minkow's story, although Assistant 
U.S. Attys. James Asperger and Gordon Greenberg said Krowpman did help generate 
paper work showing that a tool company he represented was supplying large 
quantities of tools for ZZZZ Best's phony insurance restoration work, when in 
fact it was not. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Knew He Was Lying' 
</P>
<P>
Asperger said it is even possible that Krowpman believed Minkow's story that 
most of the insurance restoration jobs were real. "But he knew he was telling 
lies . . . He was used and manipulated by Barry Minkow, but Barry Minkow was 
capable of using and manipulating some incredibly sophisticated people." 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of the defendants comes here and says how naive they were," the 
judge said. "This is not a situation where the Keystone Cops masterminded this 
tremendous fraud." 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian also noted the estimated $600,000 Krowpman allegedly took in through 
his dealings with ZZZZ Best. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get $600,000 over a short period of time just standing around in 
line," the judge said. "He doesn't want to destroy that income stream. It's not 
naivete. It's greed." 
</P>
<P>
Tevrizian also was harsh with Rothberg, who accepted more than $17,000 to 
backtrack from his initial reports to auditors that ZZZZ Best was faking the 
insurance restoration work. 
</P>
<P>
"You're educated, you're articulate, you're intelligent, and I think what 
happened is you got caught in that whole Barry Minkow thing, going for the home 
run each and every time you step up to the plate," the judge said. "You caught 
the greed bug, the greed disease." 
</P>
<P>
Rothberg's attorney, Richard D. Burda, said Rothberg was a relatively poor 
staff accountant who was watching everyone around him make millions. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think he's been poor and scraping for so long . . . that he wanted a 
taste for himself," Burda said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney also said it was Rothberg who initially raised the suspicion of 
outside lawyers and accountants, touching off the investigations that 
eventually led to ZZZZ Best's downfall. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the whistle-blower in this case," he said, prompting Tevrizian to 
interject: 
</P>
<P>
"The whistle got plugged up."

BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR 20 BANK HOLDUPS; 
</P>
<P>
A PAIR OF BUSY ROBBERS PREY ON COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal authorities are seeking two men in connection with nearly 20 Orange 
County bank robberies in which the robbers used threats but never showed a 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
The men, who have acted individually, have struck only in the northern part of 
the county, leading authorities to believe that they may not live here. Bank 
cameras have captured both robbers at work, producing clear pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"We are wary that they are coming in from Los Angeles County," said Bucky Cox, 
a supervisor special agent with the FBI in Santa Ana. "These guys may not 
reside or work in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have dubbed the most prolific robber "the Nerd" because of the 
thick eyeglasses he wore in one of the estimated 17 robberies he is believed to 
have committed since Oct. 7. He last struck on Feb. 23 at an Anaheim bank. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand for Cash 
</P>
<P>
This robber typically approaches a bank teller with a note or a verbal demand 
for cash. Once the teller has emptied the cash drawer, he walks away without 
calling attention to himself. The Nerd has escaped with relatively small 
amounts of cash, according to Cox, who said FBI policy prohibits release of the 
amounts stolen. 
</P>
<P>
He has worn a variety of outfits and disguises: shorts, a sports jacket and 
tie, sunglasses and baseball caps. "His style is California mod," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nerd, who has hit banks in Westminster, La Habra, Orange, Tustin, Santa 
Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Brea and Diamond Bar, is described as Caucasian, in 
his mid-20s, about 5-foot-7 and with a slim build. 
</P>
<P>
The second thief is more threatening than the Nerd and has hit the same bank 
twice in just 10 weeks. In two robberies, he has netted more than the Nerd in 
all 17 holdups, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Threatening' 
</P>
<P>
"He is very threatening," Cox said. "He tells tellers, 'You don't want anybody 
to get hurt,' or 'Give me all that you have and nobody will get hurt.' " 
</P>
<P>
He robbed the Great Western Savings &amp; Loan, 8020 Stanton Blvd. in Buena 
Park, on Dec. 10. On Feb. 22, he returned to the same Great Western branch, 
less than an hour after he had apparently lost his composure and fled during an 
attempted robbery at another Buena Park bank, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The second robber is described as Caucasian, 55 to 60 years old, with gray 
hair. He is 6-foot to 6-foot-2, and 180 to 240 pounds. He has worn a sports 
jacket and tie in each holdup, and in the latest robbery also wore a snap-brim 
hat. Witnesses say he may drive a red and white 1984-86 Mazda Model 323 or 626.

DEATH SENTENCE STANDS FOR POLICEMAN'S KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to set aside the death sentence of 
John G. Brown, convicted in 1982 of murdering Garden Grove Police Officer 
Donald Reed, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Brown killed Reed during a June 7, 1980, shoot-out at the Cripple Creek Saloon 
in Garden Grove when Reed tried to serve him with an arrest warrant. The 
officer was shot once in the chest and died shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
According to police testimony, when Brown saw Reed and two reserve officers 
enter the bar, he rose from his table and ran toward the building's rear door. 
At the door he pulled a .22-caliber automatic pistol from his jacket and began 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
After spraying bullets throughout the barroom, Brown fled on foot. Sheriff's 
deputies found him a few blocks away hiding in bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve Officer Glen Overly, 21, was wounded in the chest, abdomen and hand, 
and Reserve Office Dwight Henninger, 20, was hit in the upper arm. Two 
customers, John Terzia and William McKinney, also were wounded during the 
shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the shooting, Brown was being sought on warrants for suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon and suspicion of selling marijuana, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During his trial in Orange County Superior Court, Brown testified that he 
couldn't remember the shooting because amphetamines he had been taking caused a 
memory lapse. When Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown asked him why his 
fingerprints were found on the pistol used in the shooting, Brown answered: "My 
fingerprints probably are on 1,000 guns in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Brown's conviction received considerable attention in August when it was heard 
by the California Supreme Court. Prosecutors had asked the justices to adopt a 
new, less-stringent standard in determining whether errors had been committed 
during the appellate process. The jurists refused that request and upheld the 
death sentences of Brown and two other killers.

HIT-RUN INCIDENT CLAIMS A 'MOM' TO ABANDONED 
</P>

<P>
A 56-year-old Huntington Beach woman who worked as a volunteer companion for 
AIDS patients was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver near her home 
Monday morning, and a suspect who lives just a few blocks away was arrested, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Velma McClure was walking her dog along Ashland Drive shortly after 7 a.m. when 
she was hit and dragged more than 100 feet, according to Huntington Beach 
Police Lt. Bill Mamelli. There apparently were no witnesses to the accident, 
but neighbors heard the crash and ran to McClure's aid. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Paige Distefano, 43, of Huntington Beach, was arrested at 3:30 
p.m. as she drove her damaged 1977 white Lincoln Continental along Main Street 
near Golden West Street in Westminster. Information developed by investigators 
led to Distefano, said Mamelli, who refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication that Distefano, who was held on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter and felony hit-and-run, knew McClure, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No further information was available on Distefano, and a man who answered the 
telephone at her home refused to comment. Distefano remained in the Huntington 
Beach jail Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
McClure was described Monday by her children, friends and employer as a loving, 
spiritual person. She got an insurance license and returned to work after she 
was divorced about 4 years ago and was studying to be a practitioner in her 
church. She spent much of her free time as a volunteer companion for the AIDS 
Service Foundation in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
McClure's son, Tom, said she began working with patients suffering from 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome "after she lost a couple of friends to the 
disease." In addition to Tom, 38, McClure was the mother of two other children, 
David, 31, and Mary Ann, 25. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a companion to people whose families had abandoned them," Tom McClure 
said. "She was a Mom to them." 
</P>
<P>
Tom McClure, who learned of his mother's death when a neighbor called him 
Monday morning, said she had doted on her pets, Me Too, a Lhasa apso, and a 
second dog that she reluctantly had put to sleep a few months ago. Me Too 
returned home unharmed after McClure was hit, her son said. 
</P>

"Every morning and every night she took the dogs out," Tom McClure said. "They 
were surrogate children, I think. The dog is home and underfoot again." 
</P>
<P>
Lester Turner, who met McClure about 2 years ago when they both were studying 
to be practitioners at the Church of Religious Science of Laguna Beach, 
described her as "a friendly, loving person." 
</P>
<P>
She had worked in the insurance field many years ago, and went to work for 
Turner in his Newport Beach insurance office so that she could regain her 
license, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She left his firm in October because she wanted to work with elderly clients, 
and Trenary Insurance Services in Laguna Hills offered a position that would 
allow her to do that, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"She got traded to a better league," he said. "She accomplished what she set 
out to do here: get her insurance license. She enjoyed talking and working with 
elderly people, so when the job with Trenary came up, it was a perfect 
marriage."

SAN CLEMENTE PLANNER CAN STAY ON PANEL 
</P>

The San Clemente City Council voted unanimously Monday night to let Hal Joseph 
remain on the Planning Commission after hearing a city attorney's opinion that 
his role in bringing a developer to a project in the city would result in only 
a temporary conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Tom Lorch said the question of Joseph's removal from the 
Planning Commission was "an emotional issue . . . and something we still don't 
have all the facts on." 
</P>
<P>
"So we decided to remove it (from the council agenda)," allowing Joseph to 
retain his post, Lorch said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Brian J. Rice had called for Joseph's resignation from the five-member 
commission last week because of Joseph's involvement in getting Centex 
Development Corp. to purchase undeveloped portions of the 1,077-acre Forster 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abstained From Voting 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, who stands to receive a finder's fee from the landowner, Estrella 
Properties, has abstained from voting on any matter affecting the Forster Ranch 
property and Dallas-based Centex since last March. Rice has contended that 
Joseph could be required to abstain from votes on the project through March, 
1990, thereby crippling the commission's ability to deal effectively with a 
major issue in the city. 
</P>
<P>
But after Monday night's meeting, Rice explained his change of position on 
Joseph. "The city attorney's comments that there is a conflict of interest only 
lasting 2 months made me decide to move for removal (of the issue from the 
council agenda)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph, a longtime real estate consultant who has been a member of the Planning 
Commission for the past 3 years, left immediately after the vote and was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, Joseph said of the controversy: "This is not World War III. 
"I haven't done anything wrong or illegal. Everything I've done has been very 
up-front and I think the council has gone overboard in saying that I should be 
removed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Centex Plan Approved 
</P>
<P>
Centex, which has expressed an interest in purchasing the Forster property 
since last March, has been negotiating with the city over development plans. 
Monday night, the City Council approved Centex's plan to build a 233-home 
development on the land. Centex was one of eight developers competing for a 
limited number of housing units allowed under the city's 1986 growth-control 
ordinance, Measure B. 
</P>
<P>
Forster Ranch is one of San Clemente's four major developments slated to be 
considered by the Planning Commission in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
On advice from San Clemente City Atty. Jeff Oderman, Joseph has been abstaining 
from votes on all matters involving Forster Ranch and Centex that have come 
before the commission since last March. 
</P>
<P>
Rice last week called for Joseph's resignation, saying his abstentions leave 
only four planning commissioners who can vote, raising the possibility of tie 
votes on sensitive issues affecting the property and Centex. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph said he had planned to formally resign his post at tonight's Planning 
Commission meeting but changed his mind after receiving a letter from the mayor 
last week demanding his resignation by noon last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rice also offered Joseph the option of issuing a public declaration that he 
would not accept any money from the Centex Corp. If Joseph did not resign or 
issue the declaration, Rice said at the time, he would have the issue placed on 
Monday's City Council agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, it was thought that state conflict-of-interest laws would require 
that Joseph abstain through March, 1990, a year and a day after close of escrow 
on the sale. But the state Fair Political Practices Commission later advised 
Oderman that since Centex was the buyer and the finder's fee was being paid by 
the seller, Joseph would not be in conflict-of-interest after the close of 
escrow.

GEIBERGER DISCOVERS THAT LIFE GOES ON; 
</P>
<P>
LOSS OF HIS SON WAS LATEST TRAGEDY THAT GOLFER HAD TO OVERCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This is a wonderful time to be a member of the Senior PGA Tour. It has given a 
large number of the 50-and-older professional golfers a second career. Why 
shouldn't they be happy? They are making more money than they ever dreamed 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Thursday, the seniors will play in the $370,000, 72-hole Vintage 
Chrysler Invitational at the Vintage Country Club in Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
It will be fun for most. But for one of the top contenders, it probably won't 
be. It is with a heavy heart that Al Geiberger competes these days. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger's 2-year-old son, Matthew, drowned in a community swimming pool near 
his home in Palm Desert, just a couple of miles down the hill from the Vintage, 
last August. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't touch a club for a month," said Geiberger, who has had one problem 
after another since becoming a pro golfer after graduating from USC in 1959. 
"But there becomes a time when you have to go on with life. It's what I do for 
a living and I was sort of forced to go back. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to Matthew has given me a new perspective on life. What seemed 
important before isn't anymore." 
</P>
<P>
When he became eligible for the older circuit on Sept. 1, 1987, Geiberger was 
in his element. He won three tournaments, even though the season was almost 
over when he started. One was the Vantage championship in South Carolina with a 
first prize of $135,000, almost triple the biggest purse in his 11 wins on the 
regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
Since his return, he has been competitive, finishing second three times. In his 
second tournament back, he tied for second in his defense of the Vantage and 
earned more than $68,000. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger will probably forever be remembered as the only golfer to shoot a 59 
in PGA competition. It happened in the Memphis Open on the second round in 
1977. Despite all the young long-ball hitters and the improved equipment, 
nobody has matched that score and he is still known as Mr. 59. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger thought he had put his problems behind him when he married the former 
Carolyn Spring in 1985. Carolyn gave birth to two healthy sons, and the senior 
tour enabled Geiberger to recover financially. Everything was rosy until 
tragedy struck again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tougher on Carolyn than on me," he said. "Matthew was her first child. 
I had already had four from the other marriages. I think it helped her to have 
another son, Al Jr., who was born just before the 1988 Tournament of Champions. 
But she still blames herself. It has been difficult, but with the help of a 
wonderful psychologist in Santa Barbara, Ira Weinstein, she is recovering." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn was getting ready to take Matthew and Al's 12-year-old son, Bryan, 
swimming. She thought Bryan was watching him. Matthew strolled out, passed the 
room in which Bryan was watching TV, out an unlatched door and wandered about 
150 yards through neighbors' yards to the pool, which wasn't fenced. By the 
time Carolyn found him in the pool, it was too late. Matthews' little lungs had 
absorbed too much water. 
</P>
<P>
Geiberger was in Lexington, Ky., playing in a senior event. Matthew was still 
alive when Geiberger arrived home, but just barely, and died shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It was soon after I started playing again that I heard someone moaning about a 
stupid mistake he made on the course," Geiberger said. "I thought, 'He has no 
idea what a stupid mistake really is.' 
</P>
<P>
"It took a series of stupid mistakes, I guess you would call them, for Matthew 
to die. Just think, if any one hadn't happened he'd be alive. 
</P>
<P>
"A few days before on one of our walks, I showed Matthew the pool and he kept 
wanting to go swimming. If I hadn't shown him the pool . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If Carolyn hadn't spent longer than usual getting ready . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If Bryan hadn't been so absorbed in television that he didn't see Matthew 
walking by the door . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If the cleaning woman had latched the door as she had been told to do . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And, if all those people had not failed to notice a 2-year-old heading for the 
pool . . . "As the psychologist told us, it was just plain bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
The Geibergers had already started plans to build a home in Solvang, about 35 
miles from Santa Barbara. Geiberger, born in Red Bluff, has lived much of the 
time since he was 15 in the Santa Barbara area. At first, they thought about 
scrapping the plans, but decided to go ahead, in part because Carolyn did not 
wish to go back to the house in Palm Desert. It has helped keep Carolyn busy 
and her mind off Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
They have been renting in Santa Barbara since the tragedy. Friends in Santa 
Barbara have made it easier for the Geibergers to recover from their loss. 
</P>
<P>
But mostly, it has been the counseling. Dr. Weinstein warned them that many 
times such a loss wrecks a marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I was afraid it might," Geiberger said. "But the 
psychologist is a pro. I have marveled at the way he has been with Carolyn. She 
was quite confused. He knows how to say the right thing in the right way. If I 
had tried to say some of those things to Carolyn, it would have caused trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"He will not let us avoid the problem. Carefully, he has Carolyn facing some 
problems, but not too often or too much. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep seeing the changes. For instance, she couldn't speak to Bryan for a 
long time. Not long ago she asked him to come live with us. She wanted to get 
rid of Matthew's toys, but I packed them away. Now, she can look at them. 
</P>
<P>
"When I had a corporate outing last month in Florida, Carolyn, Bryan and Al Jr. 
went with me. Shortly before his death we had taken Matthew to Disneyland. We 
took the boys to Disney World, which is quite similar and Carolyn was able to 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn does not look at pictures of Matthew, but she does have a keepsake, a 
crumpled baseball card. 
</P>
<P>
"Bryan, who is probably the best athlete of all my kids, collects baseball 
cards," Geiberger said. "Matthew, although he didn't know what it was all 
about, was collecting them, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Carolyn was driving us up to Solvang to see how the house was coming along. I 
looked in the glove compartment and found a crumpled up card. I started to get 
rid of it, but she stopped me and said, 'That's mine, please put it back.' That 
was another indication she's making progress. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all you can do. You can't forget, but you have to go on. There's not a 
hell of a lot else you can do. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a couple of keepsakes, too. When I took a truck down to pick up things 
we needed in Santa Barbara, I found this wallet-size picture of Matthew, which 
had dropped down behind a table. It isn't the best picture of him, but I 
thought it meant something that I found it, so I keep it in my wallet. 
</P>
<P>
"When Matthew and I were on one of our walks, he found a rock. It became sort 
of his pet rock. I also found that in the old house. I put it in my golf bag so 
I always have something when I'm playing that was important to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf is a slow sport. You have plenty of time to think of things. When play is 
slow, I have a problem because my thoughts always turn to Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
"I returned for a tournament in Georgia to get ready for defense of the 
Vantage. I didn't play very well. I had to force myself to concentrate. It just 
didn't seem important. But I shot a 71 on the final round, then really 
surprised myself at the Vantage, finishing in a tie for second." 
</P>
<P>
It was nothing new for Geiberger to battle his way back. He joined the PGA Tour 
in 1960, winning three tournaments in his first five years. He became noticed 
because, at a skinny 6-foot-2, he consumed peanut butter sandwiches while he 
was playing to keep up his energy while winning the 1966 PGA. 
</P>
<P>
He did not win another tournament for eight years, although he played well 
until 1969, when he went through a divorce. Then an inflamed colon nearly ended 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
He came back to win the 1974 Sahara Invitational. Then, on a hot Friday in 1977 
at the Memphis Open, he shot the greatest round ever in competition. He hit 
every fairway and every green and hardly missed a putt to post the fabulous 59, 
13 under par. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things he remembers most about the round was a 20-foot birdie putt 
that just failed to drop. 
</P>
<P>
His last victory on the regular tour was at the Colonial in Ft. Worth in 1979. 
The $54,000 purse was his biggest ever. Then came another setback, knee surgery 
and later more stomach problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had intestinal problems for a long time," Geiberger said. "In 1978 
because of massive polyps, they removed three inches of my colon. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1980, the polyps were back in a big mass. They were like a bunch of grapes 
the size of a baseball and they created a blockage. They had no choice but to 
take out the entire colon. 
</P>
<P>
"The procedure was called an ileostomy. When I found I had to wear a plastic 
bag, I was very depressed. I thought it would be worse than no more golf, it 
was the end of the world. It helped me recover mentally when I learned that 
Rolf Benirschke, then the field goal kicker for the (San Diego) Chargers, had 
undergone the same operation. We became good friends and he really helped me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Geiberger started preparing himself to join the senior group. And when 
he turned 50, he was ready for yet another comeback. 
</P>
<P>
In a 21-day stretch shortly after he became eligible, Geiberger earned 
$212,333, more than the $179,000 he won in 1979, his best year on the regular 
tour. His fortunes turned for the better again. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't won a tournament since the death of his son, but he has won $53,000 
this year in three events. 
</P>
<P>
He says he has no bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't feel sorry for myself," Geiberger said. "Life isn't just the good 
things. It is also a series of problems. I'm 51 and I'm in reasonably good 
health. What more can you ask for?"

MOUNTAINSIDE MIRACLE: CLIMBERS SURVIVE ORDEAL; 
</P>
<P>
PARTNER CUTS HIS ROPE, BUT HE'S STILL THANKFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Simpson, one leg badly broken, was dangling helplessly above his doom in 
the Peruvian Andes, connected to life and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, by 
a 5/16-inch nylon line. Then Yates cut the rope to save his own life. 
</P>
<P>
That's the crux of the story Simpson survived to tell in his book, "Touching 
the Void" (Harper &amp; Row, $17.95). Simpson touches a nerve of the 
mountaineering community and the hearts of others who agonize with both men. 
</P>
<P>
It's a different kind of mountain climbing book, one without recriminations 
among fellow climbers of a failed or tragic expedition or the glory of 
ascending Everest with an army of Sherpa porters. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Yates were the only ones on the mountain Siula Grande in the spring 
of 1985, so the drama is sharply focused. 
</P>
<P>
Until Simpson crawled into base camp three days later, Yates, about to start 
home the next morning, was so certain he had sent him to his death that he 
burned Simpson's clothes. He was wondering how to explain what had happened to 
their friends and Simpson's parents back in England. 
</P>
<P>
Yates noted in passages he taped for the book, "I was as much a victim as Joe. 
No one cuts the rope." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Simpson's first words to Yates afterward were, "Thanks, Simon. You did 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson dedicated the book to Yates "for a debt I can never repay." 
</P>
<P>
The way Simpson sees it, Yates saved both their lives by cutting the rope -- 
incidentally, with Simpson's Swiss army knife that Yates had in his pack. If 
both men had gone over the edge, Simpson is certain they would have been linked 
in death. 
</P>
<P>
"Simon made one mistake," Simpson said later. "He should have left me as soon 
as I broke my leg. We both knew then I was as good as dead." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Yates chose to try to lower Simpson down the mountain by rope, 300 
feet at a time, battling storms, avalanches and frostbite. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said: "It is tragic that after the brilliant rescue that Simon carried 
out . . . after he saved my life, all anyone wants to talk about is how he cut 
the bloody rope. It was exactly the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
Was Yates simply following some traditional code of climbing, a law of the 
mountain: "If you can't save the other guy, save yourself."? 
</P>
<P>
Dan McConnell, media coordinator for expeditions out of Seattle, where many of 
America's top climbers are based, said: "Things like that have happened, but 
it's an experience that few have survived. Those situations, while few and far 
between, are real and have to be dealt with according to the conditions of the 
moment. There are no rules and guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Yates achieved the first ascent of the difficult 4,500-foot west 
face of 21,000-foot Siula Grande and were descending when Simpson fell and 
broke his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
Yates already had lowered Simpson 3,000 feet and was holding him unseen over a 
precipice when the snow seat he was using for leverage started to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Yates then executed the decision that would leave him twisting between guilt 
and reality for the next three days: "Joe was dead. I might as well have put a 
gun to his head and shot him. . . . I should feel guilty. I don't. . . . I 
hated the place for what it had made me do." 
</P>
<P>
Unknown to Yates, Simpson barely missed a 3,000-foot drop and fell 100 feet 
into a cavern of snow and ice, from where he hopped and dragged himself back to 
camp. He figures he was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had landed five feet to the left and gone down that big hole, I'd just 
have disappeared," Simpson said. "If I'd broken my leg on the first day (of the 
descent), there's no way Simon could have rescued me from high up on those 
fluted hills. No chance." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, 28, passed through Los Angeles on a promotional tour for the book 
recently and reflected on how the event has changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving a Masters degree in philosophy and English from the University 
of Edinburgh, he was content just to climb mountains, even if it meant washing 
dishes to earn a living. He moved to Sheffield, which he calls "the capital of 
British climbing," as Seattle is to the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Siula Grande, and initially, he said, "The climbing community was 
just stunned. I got some sort of folk fame in the climbing world, which I feel 
very embarrassed about because Simon has done far more climbing than me, and 
yet I'm better known for surviving something. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the people I live among and respect, I'm really not deserving of that. 
You should get respect from climbing mountains, not from just having one 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The other sad thing was that the face we climbed was a brilliant effort. It 
was a first ascent, a very hard ascent, we did it with style, and that has got 
completely forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
In the book, Simpson writes that although he knew he "was done for," he feared 
death less than the possibility that both he and Yates might "disappear without 
a trace (and) they'd never know we did it." 
</P>
<P>
God would have known, but that didn't interest Simpson. In the narrative of his 
ordeal, from when he broke his leg at 11 a.m. on June 8, to when Yates cut the 
rope at about 7:30 that night and until Simpson slumped into camp at 1 a.m. on 
June 11, he writes graphically of his fears -- "My legs began to tremble . . . 
my nerve failed me" -- but nowhere is there the slightest hint that he ever 
prayed for Divine assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is southern Irish and as Roman Catholic as you can get," he said. "I 
was brought up going to monasteries, catechisms and all that, and at 16 I found 
I didn't have any faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I did wonder, before Peru, if it came to a crunch whether I would think, 'Oh, 
sorry, I really didn't mean it.' 
</P>
<P>
"When the rope was being cut, I knew I was going down, I absolutely and totally 
believed that this was the moment of my death. I never thought of calling out 
to God. I just thought, 'This is it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if I was a stronger religious person, if I thought there was some 
life after death or anything else, whether I would have tried quite as hard, 
because I believe when you're dead you're dead. That's the end of everything." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson will leave that debate to theologians, while he sorts out his new life 
of riches unknown to most mountaineers. 
</P>
<P>
Yates, meanwhile, has shunned the spotlight and returned to his mountains, at 
peace with himself and his decision to cut the rope. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear to a mountaineer," Simpson said. "I don't think he gives a 
damn what a non-climber thinks. It's not his world and they don't really 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what his parents would have thought of Yates, had Simpson not returned, 
Simpson said, "They would have reckoned he was guilty of homicide or something 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson is 5-foot-8 1/2 and about 150 pounds. Dehydrated and starved, and after 
two days on a mule and another in the back of a pickup truck getting back to 
Lima, he said he lost about "three stone" (42 pounds) during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
His right knee, where the bones jammed and crushed together, remains somewhat 
stiff when he walks, and after six operations his doctors tell him he may need 
an artificial hinge in a few more years. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Simpson seems to envy Yates. 
</P>
<P>
"He's getting on with his climbing life, and my life has been irrevocably 
changed and will be again by whatever happens to my leg, but also by the fact 
that I've gone from being like Simon, which is penniless and living the 
anarchistic style that you do live, just to climb. You don't give a damn about 
a pension or security. 
</P>
<P>
"I seem to have been accidentally catapulted into something I'm still trying to 
come to terms with. I got a big advance off the American (publishing) company. 
I've never seen that amount of money in my life. Don't know what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder whether the whole rest of my life will get dictated by this one 
event, like people who fought in the war, and then the war finished, and they 
had nothing else in their lives but to feed back that experience." 
</P>
<P>
The book was first published in Britain, where it sold about 10,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would sell about 2,000, which is what the average climbing book 
sells in Britain," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I get worried about is that I live in Sheffield. I have all my friends 
there, and people I live with are miles away from this world. Part of the 
reason for stuffing all the money into some investment accounts is to pretend I 
haven't got it. I don't want to lose that." 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of a film being made from the book. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a very difficult film to make, to make it sensitively," 
Simpson said. "You could make the death and glory on the mountain top 
adventure, but a lot of the action in the book is in my head and in Simon's 
head." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson has climbed a little since, but nothing as demanding as Siula Grande. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't mean I climbed beyond my limits," Simpson said. "Simon and I were 
at the top end of mountaineering levels (where) your risk levels are so much 
higher. (But) I wouldn't push the boat out quite as far as Simon is doing now. 
Maybe I got a bit too scared."

HE'S YANKEE FOR LOVE, MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
SAX STILL SAYS DODGERS DIDN'T SHOW HIM EITHER IN NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>

<P>
His recollections of those final negotiations with the Dodgers still leave a 
bad taste and he has no regrets about accepting a free-agent offer from the New 
York Yankees, Steve Sax said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the waning hours of February, a long way from the Bronx Zoo and the first 
salvo from Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, Sax also seemed to say he will be 
better prepared for the 1989 season than if he were still training at 
Dodgertown. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it there, but I just think I get more work in here," he said. "There's 
not as much standing around. Every minute is accounted for. It's more 
organized, efficient and businesslike. The team is loose, but the workouts are 
more regimented and I like that. It reminds me of the way my dad ruled our 
house with an iron hand." 
</P>
<P>
The strong-willed Dallas Green wields the hammer as Yankee manager. No 
interruptions, please, as he attempts to instill discipline and a team concept. 
Reporters must leave the clubhouse 30 minutes before workouts begin and are not 
allowed beyond the dirt track in front of the dugouts until work is over. In 
other words, keep off the grass. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is no need for a Dodgertown-type road map. The three 
diamonds at the Yankee complex are back to back to back. No autograph-seeking, 
camera-toting fans clog the pathways as they do at Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The clubhouse is bigger, the batting cages are better and you don't get bogged 
down by people walking up to you in the middle of a workout," Sax said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy here. I like it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
What would he be expected to say after only one week with his new team? 
</P>
<P>
Will the euphoria last or will the pinstripes turn to poison? 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't he think he might have made the wrong decision? 
</P>
<P>
"I did all my thinking before I made the decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had 11 wonderful years with the Dodgers, but I haven't once regretted that 
decision. I'll miss the friendships, but there was no comparison between the 
contracts. On sheer economics, there was no problem leaving." 
</P>
<P>
Sax signed with the Yankees on Nov. 23 and said then that it went beyond 
economics to a difference in tone. 
</P>
<P>
He said then that he was made to feel wanted by the Yankees but shown little 
respect by his own Dodgers. He said that Executive Vice President Fred Claire 
treated him with aloofness, as if he were a "punk" kid. 
</P>
<P>
Sax said he still develops a "bad taste" when he weighs that treatment against 
his 11 years with the organization and his contributions as an offensive 
catalyst, particularly during the Dodgers' improbable march to their 1988 World 
Series victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I came in with a positive attitude, expecting to hammer out a new contract in 
15 or 20 minutes, but never got close," Sax said. "They made me feel that I was 
lucky they were even talking to me. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I had my hopes up and shouldn't have. I guess it was vain to think I'd 
be treated special. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear all that stuff about the Dodger family. Well, they convinced me that 
my family lives at home." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers began the negotiations with an offer of $2.3 million for two years, 
then went to $3.2 million for three years and finally $3.5 for three. Sax and 
his agent, Jerry Kapstein, wanted $3.9 for three and eventually got a 
three-year, $4-million guarantee from the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the New York contract guarantees Sax $350,000 in commercial 
opportunities, provided $50,000 in moving expenses and stipulates that he will 
receive $100,000 if traded in any of the three years and $100,000 if sent to 
the minors in that time. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers, Sax said, assumed a take-it-or-leave-it stance from the start and, 
at one point, Claire told him, " 'If you think you're getting screwed, go 
somewhere else.' So, I did. I made my own business decision and feel good about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"The most upsetting thing is that Fred keeps saying he wasn't given the right 
of first refusal, but for nine straight days we told him what it would take 
(the $3.9 million). The last time Jerry told him, I thought it had finally sunk 
in, but apparently not. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't come back to him with the Yankee offer because I wasn't going to 
shop it around. I wasn't going to do my free-agent business that way. I would 
have taken less to sign with the Dodgers, and Fred knew what it was. We dealt 
with the Dodgers in good faith. I thought they'd treat me professionally, but 
it was the Yankees who did." 
</P>
<P>
There have been unconfirmed reports that Steinbrenner tricked the Dodgers by 
failing to file his $4-million offer with the owners' information bank. The 
Dodgers, according to the reports, were under the assumption that the Yankees 
had not gone beyond a $3.4-million offer and, thus, they did not have to 
improve their $3.5-million offer. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened, Sax is only concerned now about the present and future. 
</P>
<P>
"Same show, different channel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Different league and different coast, too, but he said that he was going to 
move his family anyway, leaving the smog and traffic of Los Angeles for a house 
he is having built near his hometown of Sacramento. During the summer, he will 
rent a house in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what advice he would give Sax for coping with the club and fan 
environment, Tommy John smiled and said, "Ride with the tide. Sit back, stay 
away from it, and hope you get off to a good start." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sax: "All I can do is give 100%. I can't worry about things I have no 
control over. It's like anything. If you do well, people like you. If you do 
badly, they don't. Willie Randolph (who is now taking Sax's former position 
with the Dodgers) played here for 13 years and never had a problem. I don't 
expect to either, but ask me in September." 
</P>
<P>
It was only last October, during the playoff against the New York Mets, that 
Sax responded to rude fan treatment by suggesting that urban renewal start with 
a widespread detonation. 
</P>
<P>
He now dismisses that as heat-of-the-moment rhetoric and said he has always 
enjoyed the zeal of New York fans and hopes to show them similar enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that the owner and manager are committed to winning, and I share that 
commitment," Sax said. "I've been on two world champions and I'd like to make 
it more." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Green said he strongly encouraged the Yankees to pursue Sax because he 
is a player who will do anything to win, understands the concept of "situation 
baseball" and "knows how to spell team." 
</P>
<P>
Sax, who has a .282 career average and batted .277 with 42 stolen bases as the 
Dodger leadoff man last season, will hit second, behind Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I look for him to do what Jim Gilliam did for the Dodgers when Maury Wills was 
in his prime," Green said of Sax's ability to hit behind the runner and take 
pitches when Henderson steals. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have two rabbits to worry the defense and give us guys in scoring 
position for Don Mattingly, Dave Winfield and whoever else is batting behind 
them." 
</P>
<P>
There is a chance, too, that another Sax will be in the lineup. Steve's brother 
Dave, a catcher-infielder who was also once in the Dodger organization and 
spent last year at Buffalo in the Pittsburgh Pirate system, also signed with 
the Yankees as a free agent. The only guarantee in a contract also negotiated 
by Kapstein is that he will be given a chance to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
A package deal? Dave Sax smiled and said that it was only to the extent that 
Steve's signing might have made the Yankees more willing to sign him as well. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers last played together in 1983, when Dave was up briefly with the 
Dodgers. Asked about Steve's departure, Dave Sax said: 
</P>
<P>
"He had been with the Dodgers so long, had such a good career for them, was so 
popular with teammates and fans, and wanted so much to stay that I know he was 
shocked and disappointed when it didn't work out. 
</P>
<P>
"I also think he's not looking back and regards this as a new challenge. He'd 
like to show the Dodgers they made a mistake and the Yankees they didn't."

DURAN IS BACK AND AIMING FOR LEONARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All anyone had to do was look at the quality of the opposition and the effort 
Roberto Duran had put into his work over the last few years to fully appreciate 
what the rugged little champion accomplished in Atlantic City last Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
As opposed to Jorge Suero, Victor Claudio, Ricky Stackhouse and Paul Thorn -- 
no, they're not the infield of the 1932 Cincinnati Redlegs -- Duran was in 
against the goods, a heavy-hitting champion in his own right, Iran Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
From the opening bell, it was vintage Duran: A quick chop with the right hand, 
a step forward inside the countering left and a push at Barkley's shoulder to 
knock him off balance. 
</P>
<P>
The rounds rolled by and Barkley, a fearsome body puncher, piled up the points 
with his three-minute stints of all-out rib-crunching. Dave Brown, the judge, 
didn't see Barkley losing a round through the first eight and had him winning 
lopsidedly, 80-73, at that point. 
</P>
<P>
The other judges, Tom Kaczmarek and Giuseppe Ferrai, had it just about even, 
obviously favoring Roberto's more diversified attack pattern and his clever 
maneuvering on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
With two-thirds of the fight in the books and with the 37-year-old Duran 
searching the hall for a spare breath to help him over the last four rounds, it 
was time to call it a splendid effort by the three-time champ and let it go at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Duran won the ninth and 10th rounds with something to spare. He was now ahead 
on two cards and victory was in sight. But, he had been in the same situation 
back in 1983 in Las Vegas, Nev., leading Marvin Hagler after 13 rounds, only to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, he stepped up the pace in the 11th round. The combatants resembled 
Tony Zale and Rocky Graziano having at it until, suddenly, Duran landed a 
right, a left and two more rights and Barkley was down. A near sellout crowd of 
7,000, braving a flash snowstorm which left more than a foot of snow on the 
boardwalk outside, erupted. "DU-RAN, DU-RAN," they squealed. The 12th round was 
a formality. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to reach down real deep, this being his last hurrah," said 
Barkley, "but, I never thought the man could have that much left. Roberto's a 
legend and I figured they (the judges) might do it for him . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Some thought that Barkley might have gotten a raw deal, losing the split 
decision, but such arguments lost steam because of the forcefulness of Duran's 
finish. He was the stylist. He was the puncher. He was the freshest with only a 
couple of small bruises showing at the end. 
</P>
<P>
They say that boxing and a few thousand other things make for strange 
bedfellows, and this was never more evident than in the interview area long 
after the fight. All smiles and rejoicing were Duran's promoter Bob Arum, Sugar 
Ray Leonard's man Mike Trainer and Pat Petronelli, representing Hagler. You 
could almost see the dollar signs in their eyes as they kibitzed. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, folks, Duran is back, and all indications are that Hagler is 
coming back and Sugar Ray hasn't threatened to retire for at least a couple of 
weeks now. Turn back the clock five years and let the round-robin and 
bargaining begin, pursuant to Leonard defeating Tommy Hearns in their June 12 
bout in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Duran said he was "proud" of his effort, but that fight fans haven't yet seen 
the best of his latter-day career. "For Leonard," he said, "I will be at my 
peak. I will be right. After being off so long, I rushed training for this 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, since beating someone named Jeff Lanas in Chicago last October, Duran 
reportedly went home and put on about 25 pounds, ballooning to 190. He weighed 
156 for Barkley and said that he won't pig out again. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people thought I was through, but I looked in my heart and knew I 
could come back," said Duran, who has now won titles at 135, 147, 154 and 160 
pounds. Many assumed he was washed up because of unimpressive performances 
against lackluster opposition, peculiar training habits and an apparent lack of 
resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Once he put his mind to it, apparently, he was the Duran who devasted the 
lightweights, beat Leonard for the welterweight crown in 1980 and gave Hagler 
all he could handle over 15 rounds a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care so much for Hearns," he said. "I want Sugar Ray." 
</P>
<P>
He explained through an interpreter that a third fight with Leonard was not 
designed to avenge his "no mas" loss to his rival several years ago: "That is 
not the motive." 
</P>
<P>
He didn't say what was pushing him toward a rubber match with Sugar Ray, but 
it's pretty well understood what the motivating factor involved is: good, 
old-fashioned hate.

CLIPPERS TO FINISH OFF FUTILE MARCH AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers have come home, by all appearances, to finish their obituary for 
the 1988-89 season. 
</P>
<P>
They have 11 victories, second-fewest in the National Basketball Assn., but 
will play 18 of their final 26 games at the Sports Arena, starting tonight 
against the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when the Clippers had a forward named Danny Manning, a coach named Gene 
Shue and a goal of respectability this season, that would have been something 
to look forward to. Now, though, even surpassing the 1987-88 total of 17 
victories appears a lofty goal. Just the same, Coach Don Casey continues to 
talk optimistically. 
</P>
<P>
"My thinking is to rejuvenate our players, to make a stand, to make our march 
in March and end on a high note," he said. "We want to give the fans and the 
franchise some real good feelings about the future." 
</P>
<P>
If that's going to happen, the Clippers have to start now, and beat some good 
teams in the process. They have lost nine consecutive games, 28 of 29 and are 
11-45 overall. Philadelphia, tonight's opponent, trails only New York in the 
Atlantic Division. Still ahead at the Sports Arena, among others, are 
Cleveland, Phoenix, Detroit, Boston, Golden State, the Lakers and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, after losing by an average of 14.2 points on the just-completed 
five-game trip, are different from the ones who left after a pair of five-point 
Sports Arena losses, one in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, they are younger. The roster is the same, but the emphasis 
isn't. The young players -- four rookies and four second-year pros -- will be 
given more playing time, the better to evaluate them, especially with another 
expansion draft coming up. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, 10-year veteran Norm Nixon has seen his playing time dwindle from 26 
minutes through the first 51 games to 20.8 in his last five appearances in 
favor of rookies Gary Grant and Tom Garrick at point guard, just as Nixon, 
returning after serious injuries, reached a level of consistently good play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's good all the time, but we're going in the right direction 
of playing competitively with the young guys, and we could win a couple with 
the older guys, but where does that get us?" Casey said. "That's the issue as I 
see it: When you play young people primarily, you jeopardize a victory." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the young Clippers may have returned as the worst team in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one problem," Casey said. "You have a rookie point guard who is 
playing with rookies. . . . The young guys have not established outside games 
(as shooters), Charles (Smith) is still trying to get an inside game by pro 
standards, (Joe) Wolf and Reggie (Williams), after missing so much of last 
season with injuries, are practically rookies because of that." 
</P>
<P>
Will Casey strike out? 
</P>
<P>
He remains interim coach and no decision has been made about his future, so the 
final 26 games are as important to his future as any player's. He has brought a 
certain enthusiasm that was missing in Shue's final weeks, but, clearly, 
consistent double-digit losses can't be what owner Donald T. Sterling had in 
mind when Casey was told to be competitive. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the decision to lean strongly to youth came from above. 
Moreover, Sterling isn't exactly rushing to douse rumors that talks have 
already started to find a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Casey, in his first stint as a NBA head coach, refuses to spend 
time worrying about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The (interim) label is there," he said. "I thought when they asked me to take 
it over, it was a dilemma. . . . The way it was presented to me, was to get 
them to play hard and then we'll see what's best for the franchise at the end 
of the year. I think we're accomplishing that, but I think along the way they'd 
like to have some Ws mixed in. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been more difficult than I thought it would be. I have talked to a lot 
of coaches at games who say that I didn't know what I was in for when I took 
over a team on a losing streak and with a lot of problems. In my mind, I 
thought I had all the magic answers, and when they didn't occur, I got 
disappointed and upset. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're an assistant coach in this league and have not been a head coach, 
you don't understand. You can't fully appreciate the dilemma of a head coach. . 
. . We're talking about a team that has won 12 and 17 games the last two years. 
Things like that do not change overnight."

Cayton also asked the commission to fine King and his Don King Productions. The

SEAVER, OUT OF BASEBALL SINCE '86, RETURNS AS COMMENTATOR FOR NBC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tom Seaver is back in the rotation. It won't be on the mound, though. It'll be 
in the TV booth. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, the lame duck network of baseball's Game of the Week, announced Monday 
that Seaver will be its top color commentator this year, joining play-by-play 
man Vin Scully. Seaver replaces Joe Garagiola, who quit after last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to practice on the days I didn't pitch," Seaver said of his 
broadcasting. "Some days I wished that I did do it on the days I was pitching, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
Seaver has been out of baseball since the end of the 1986 season. He became a 
free agent and no one wanted him. Then, in the summer of 1987 he tried a 
comeback with the New York Mets but decided he didn't have enough left in his 
right arm. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's final season begins on March 25 with a Dodger exhibition game against the 
Boston Red Sox. Seaver opens the regular season in Atlanta, where the Braves 
play host to the Dodgers on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
After this season, the Game of the Week is no more. CBS, which takes over 
baseball in 1990, will show only 12 games during the season.

NEWSWIRE: LANDRY BIDS DALLAS COWBOYS A TEARFUL FAREWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Landry said Monday that saying goodby to the Dallas Cowboys was one of the 
most difficult things he has ever had to do. 
</P>
<P>
Landry, who spent 29 years as the Cowboys' coach, choked up and couldn't finish 
his speech in a lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard to keep your emotions under control," said a red-eyed Landry. "I 
tried to tell (the players) that this crisis will pass, that you have to keep 
moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
New owner Jerry Jones removed Landry as coach Saturday, naming University of 
Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson as his replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a dry eye in the room," said Dallas linebacker Eugene Lockhart of 
Landry's farewell speech. "Coach told us he loves us all and, although he 
couldn't be with us in person from now on, he would be with us in spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Danny White observed that it was difficult to see Landry in a 
situation he couldn't handle, adding, "It's something I'll never forget. It may 
have lasted only five minutes but time stood still, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Landry said he didn't ever want to coach again. Nor does he want to get into 
politics. He had one year left on his contract and is owed approximately 
$800,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stay inactive, so I will have to do something," Landry said.

In another development, sports therapist Jack Scott said that Johnson was a 
"pharmaceutical testing ground," alleging that the sprinter was pumped with 
steroids without his direct knowledge before the Olympics by Astaphan. 
</P>
<P>
Scott's role in Johnson's training for the Olympics is detailed in the April 
issue of Runner's World magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he was appalled by the "disloyalty" shown by Astaphan.

Wade Boggs said, "Justice has paid off," in a court decision throwing out a 
major portion of his former girlfriend's lawsuit against the Boston Red Sox 
star player. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeals in California threw out a key portion of 
Margo Adams' $12-million lawsuit against Boggs, ruling that she can't sue for 
emotional reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan had a clear-the-air meeting 
with pitcher Dennis (Oil Can) Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd became the first Boston player to publicly criticize Boggs publicly for 
the Adams affair, calling his teammate a sex fiend and suggesting he see a 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd refused to talk after the meeting, but Morgan said that Boyd was angry 
over some of the newspaper accounts of his remarks, contending he hadn't said 
such things.

Rickey Henderson of New York Yankees says excessive drinking by some of his 
teammates hurt the club's pennant chances last season. 
</P>
<P>
"You would see them all drunk on the plane. You would see them out and they're 
drunk," Henderson told the Westchester (N.Y.) Gannett newspapers. "How can you 
perform the next day? Liquor does not leave you overnight." 
</P>
<P>
He did not identify any players.

Ben Johnson's doctor, Jamie Astaphan, has promised to testify in Toronto at the 
Canadian federal inquiry into drugs and amateur sport fueled by the sprinter's 
steroid scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan isn't expected to testify for several days. Charlie Francis, Johnson's 
coach, is the scheduled first witness today. 
</P>
<P>
Astaphan, who lives on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts, has provided written 
assurances to give his version of events that led to Johnson's being stripped 
of a gold medal in the 100 meters at the Seoul Olympics. Johnson tested 
positive for the steroid stanozolol.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK; 
</P>
<P>
SADUNAS HOPES TO SWEEP MATER DEI TO GIRLS' SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA CARTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saule Sadunas is a serious student. She is just as serious on the soccer field 
where she plays sweeper for Mater Dei. She has to be. 
</P>
<P>
She often is the last line of defense before the goalie. 
</P>
<P>
Sadunas, The Times' athlete of the week, is one of the county's best sweepers 
and a major reason for Mater Dei's success this season. The Monarchs won the 
Angelus League title, are 22-4-2 and will play host to Canyon in the semifinals 
of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs at 3 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei has scored 69 goals and allowed only 11. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I see about Saule that carries her beyond other sweepers is, number 
one, she is unbelievably consistent, and she does what we call in soccer 
'constructive distributions,' " Coach Marty Breen said. "She doesn't just kick 
the ball up field to get the pressure off . . . when Saule moves the ball, we 
retain possession. She is constructively building something, not just kicking 
it away, but generating a quick counterattack. That comes from her intelligence 
and ability to see how things are evolving on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Saule has earned a 4.3 grade-point average on a 4.0 scale by taking honors 
courses in English, history and algebra. 
</P>
<P>
An intelligent sweeper is a luxury, said Monarch goalie Michelle Lodyga, who 
has logged 20 shutouts this season thanks to her abilities and her defensive 
support. 
</P>
<P>
She and many of her teammates credit Saule as the team's unsung hero. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to play with a sweeper who is either not confident or not smart 
enough to realize something is not working. But Saule is very confident," 
Lodyga said. 
</P>
<P>
Saule, a junior, played her first two seasons on varsity as a forward. 
Initially, she was upset about the switch to the low-profile position of 
sweeper this season, but she has adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of the team realizes my contribution," she said. "They tell me 
how they know I don't get a lot of recognition, but that they really appreciate 
what I do. So in a way I do get recognition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Joni Easterly scored 44 points in two games to help Katella's girls' basketball 
team to Southern Section 4-A playoff victories over Woodbridge and top-seeded 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Keri Erkenbrack's three-point shot with 7 seconds remaining gave Canyon a 49-48 
semifinal victory over Camarillo in a 4-A playoff game. She finished with 29 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda guard Aimee McDaniel connected on 15 of 16 shots for a season-high 
35 points in the Wildcats' 3-A quarterfinal victory over St. Lucy's of Glendora 
Thursday. She scored a team-high 18 points Saturday in a semifinal victory over 
St. Joseph of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Michelle Lodyga made nine saves and recorded her 20th shutout of the 
season for Mater Dei (22-4-2) in a 1-0 quarterfinal victory over Long Beach 
Wilson Wednesday in the second round of the 3-A soccer playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Lynn Murray scored two goals, including the game-winner in overtime, 
and assisted on another goal to pace the top-seeded Esperanza girls' soccer 
team to a 3-1 victory over Chaffey Tuesday in the second round of the 4-A 
girls' soccer playoffs.

EDISON FACES HAWTHORNE IN 4-A SEMIFINAL

<P>
When the boys' soccer semifinals kick off today, Orange County schools will 
have one team in four of the five Southern Section playoff divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County will be without a representative in only the 1-A division. Troy 
enjoyed the most success of any county 1-A team, advancing to the quarterfinals 
before losing to top-seeded Agoura, 2-1, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A, Edison (13-5-3) travels to Hawthorne (16-9-2). Edison advanced with 
victories over Rolling Hills and Chino. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had the good fortune of being in the bottom half of the bracket -- 
away from top-seeded Palos Verdes (31-0), which plays host to Newbury Park 
(20-3-1) in the other 4-A semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Mission Viejo is the only county entry in the 3-A. Mission Viejo 
(21-1-3) gets the home-field advantage against St. Francis (17-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos field a strong offensive unit that likes to spread out the scoring. 
Fifteen of the team's 16 field players have scored at least once. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Joe-Max Moore leads the way with 24 goals and 10 assists, followed 
by Andy Wortrich with 13 goals and 14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos also have Jeff Jurgemeyer, last season's South Coast League 
offensive player of the year. Jurgemeyer has been hampered by a foot injury 
suffered during the football season and has only four goals and three assists. 
But he may be coming around just in time for the playoffs. He ran without a 
limp for the first time in the Diablos' quarterfinal victory over Cerritos, 
Coach Cal Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, fourth-seeded Esperanza (15-3-2) faces Coachella Valley (22-5) at 
Esperanza. The Aztecs advanced with victories over Laguna Hills, Paraclete and 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Small Schools division, top-seeded Whittier Christian (17-3-3) has a 
200-mile plus trip to Morro Bay (19-3-2). All games start at 3 p.m.

TITANS TO SHOW NEW OFFENSIVE LOOK; 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON MOVES WENTWORTH FROM DEFENSIVE ASSIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Fullerton football team will have its third offensive look in 
three years next season. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Gene Murphy has moved assistant Bill Wentworth to offense, where he will 
coach the quarterbacks and be involved in designing the Titans' offense. 
</P>
<P>
Wentworth, 31, coached the defensive backs last season. Before coming to 
Fullerton, he coached the offensive line at Idaho for two seasons. He also has 
coached at Indiana and Louisiana State. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Heimerdinger, the Titans' offensive coordinator last season, resigned to 
become the offensive coordinator at Rice. Heimerdinger replaced Jerry Brown, 
who left after eight seasons to become an assistant with the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
In other staff changes, Titan assistant John Miklesh is resigning to move to 
Fresno State as defensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
Miklesh, 37, leaves after six seasons, during which he was responsible for the 
outside linebackers and special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I've long respected Gene Murphy's program and I feel like they've always 
played excellent defense against us and the rest of the conference," Fresno 
State Coach Jim Sweeney said in a release. "John Miklesh is a totally prepared 
defensive coach with proven ability." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton is left with two openings for assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Donatell, who coached the secondary at Idaho the past three seasons, is 
expected to replace Wentworth as secondary coach, sources said, and a search is 
under way for a replacement for Miklesh. 
</P>
<P>
Under Donatell, 32, Idaho set several records for pass interceptions. He also 
has coached at Pacific and Washington.

U.S. SHOE TO SELL ITS NAME, FOOTWEAR DIVISION, OFFICES

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United States Shoe Corp. announced Monday that it will sell its footwear 
division, its name and its Cincinnati headquarters to a management-led group 
for $422.5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase excludes U.S. Shoe's Cincinnati-based LensCrafters division, which 
operates retail eyeglass stores, and the women's apparel retail division, based 
in Enfield, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Key executives of U.S. Shoe's footwear division, including Howard Platt, a 
company executive vice president who is president of the footwear division, are 
leaders in the purchasing group, U.S. Shoe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
500 Retail Stores 
</P>
<P>
The deal involves its major footwear distribution center in Cincinnati. U.S. 
Shoe said it will surrender its name to the new company and choose another name 
more suited to its remaining businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The division makes, imports and sells footwear and operates about 500 retail 
stores. It sells boots through its Texas Boot and Wrangler Boot divisions and 
markets women's footwear lines Amalfi, Bandolino, Calvin Klein, Capezio, 
Cobbie, David Evins, Easy Spirit, Evan Picone, Garolini, Innovations, Joyce, 
Liz Claiborne, Pappagallo, Red Cross Shoes and Selby. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is to be concluded within 90 days. U.S. Shoe's board of 
directors said it plans to use some of the proceeds of the sale to raise the 
dividend on the stock to $1 this year from 46 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects that the net proceeds will total $390 million, 
after taxes and expenses, and is subject to possible adjustments of the 
purchase price before the transaction is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Up to $50 million of the proceeds will be used to pay off long-term debts, U.S. 
Shoe officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch Capital 
Markets, is leading the investment group and has provided commitments for $160 
million of equity and subordinated debt financing for the transaction, U.S. 
Shoe said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Potential for Growth 
</P>
<P>
Philip G. Barach, chairman and chief executive of U.S. Shoe, said the sale 
results from an overall review the company announced last August to explore 
ways it could increase corporate value to the shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of this process, approximately 80 parties worldwide were contacted in 
an effort to solicit offers for all of U.S. Shoe or for any of its businesses," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barach said no prospective buyer wanted to acquire all of U.S. Shoe or made an 
acceptable offer for the women's apparel division. Several bidders made offers 
for the LensCrafters division, but it was retained in part because of its 
strong potential for growth, he said.

ALMANAC / NEW CONDOMINIUMS IN COUNTY: CONDOS CAN COST UP TO $569,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many Orange County buyers, condominiums are lower-priced alternatives to 
single-family homes. But you can also spend up to $569,000 on a condo here. 
</P>
<P>
That was the basic price for a top-of-the-line condo at the Laguna Sur 
development in Laguna Niguel, according to a recent survey of the county's 
condominium market by First American Title Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the price scale, American Skylines Real Estate Services 
was selling condos at its Cabrillo Park development in Santa Ana for $62,900. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on data compiled in November from all developments selling 
units, disclosed that the median price of a new condominium in the county was 
$141,900, and the average price was $176,033.

CRIMINAL TRIAL SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 25 IN U.S. COURT; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES FRAUD DENIED BY CARL'S JR. EMPLOYEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The accounting director for the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain pleaded not guilty 
Monday to a criminal charge of securities fraud through insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
Alvin A. DeShano, 53, of Orange was ordered to stand trial April 25 before U.S. 
District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles. Case attorneys have estimated 
the trial will last 4 to 5 days. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano, a Karcher employee for 15 years, was indicted Feb. 17 on a charge of 
receiving and using confidential corporate information to avoid a stock market 
loss of $7,107. 
</P>
<P>
He also is one 16 people accused of insider trading violations in a civil 
lawsuit filed in federal court last April by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission. That lawsuit accused Carl N. Karcher, chairman and chief executive 
of Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises, 14 Karcher family members and 
DeShano of avoiding stock market losses of at least $310,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
DeShano's attorney, David W. Wiechert, has said his client is "above reproach" 
and had "legitimate reasons for diversifying his investments and assets" that 
were "wholly unrelated" to the inside information allegedly used. 
</P>
<P>
The criminal charge against DeShano stems from the same accusations as the 
civil case, but they are a separate proceeding from the SEC's lawsuit. Trial of 
the civil case is to begin April 11 in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who is hearing the SEC case, 
ruled that DeShano need not stand trial in that civil action until the criminal 
action against him is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Some idea of DeShano's defense can be found in papers filed by his lawyer in 
the SEC civil lawsuit. DeShano "acted in good faith and without (knowledge) or 
any intention to deceive or defraud," the papers state. His attorney, Wiechert, 
has said that DeShano's good faith will be a key issue in the criminal trial. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the criminal charge, DeShano could be sentenced to prison for 
up to 5 years and fined a maximum of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wiechert and the criminal case prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. James Sanders, 
both have declined comment on why a criminal charge has been filed against 
DeShano but not against any of the other defendants in the civil case. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the defendants in the SEC lawsuit -- including company President Donald 
F. Karcher -- agreed early this month to pay a total of $187,560 in civil fines 
and penalties to settle the civil case. A seventh, Carl Leo Karcher, son of 
Carl N. Karcher, was found guilty of insider trading 5 months ago in a civil 
case.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's plan to rescue the beleaguered savings and loan industry calls 
for an increase in premiums that banks and S&amp;Ls pay for federal deposit 
insurance. Under the proposal, bankers would see their premiums rise from 83 
cents per $1,000 in deposits to $1.20 in 1990 and rise again to $1.50 in 1991. 
S&amp;Ls, which currently pay $2.08 for every $1,000 in deposits, would pay 
$2.30 in 1991 and drop to $1.80 in 1994. The accompanying chart estimates the 
amount each bank and S&amp;L in Orange County is paying now, and what each 
would pay under Bush's plan, based on deposits as of Sept. 30, 1988. Because 
there are certain deductions that banks can take, the premiums for banks are 
overstated by about 5% on average.

VIDEO CONFERENCING IS FINALLY MAKING CONTACT WITH BUSINESS WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After decades of false starts and unfulfilled promises, video conferencing is 
beginning to make a dent in the American workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Growing numbers of companies and government agencies are setting up video rooms 
that allow people separated by a few blocks or thousands of miles to hold 
"meetings" via private TV, with their images and voices relayed by satellites 
or ground transmission systems. 
</P>
<P>
The number of video rooms has about tripled in 3 years to about 700 nationwide, 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. estimates. And U.S. shipments of a key 
piece of video conferencing hardware -- a means of measuring the industry's 
success -- climbed to about 955 last year, contrasted with 490 the year before, 
according to Dataquest Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"It is emerging as a critically valuable tool for corporations," says Jack 
Caldwell, director of internal communications for Ford Motor Co., which 
recently installed one of the country's largest in-house conferencing networks 
and has made a point of keeping its size and capabilities secret. Ford, like 
other companies questioned, declined to talk about the costs of the system. 
</P>
<P>
Applications extend well beyond bread-and-butter business meetings. Parole 
boards have used them to interview prisoners, employers for look-sees at 
potential hires. Judges have conducted arraignments remotely, engineers have 
monitored test gauges on experiments conducted at other locations. At least one 
international corporate takeover has been negotiated in large part by video 
conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fall in Prices 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic fall in prices is perhaps the prime reason for the technology's 
increased popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Video conferencing today costs about 20% of what it did in 1981, according to 
Elliot M. Gold, publisher of TeleSpan, an Alta Dena, Calif., newsletter. 
Transmission costs have come down from about $2,000 an hour then for a 
high-quality picture to about $375 today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A lower-quality picture, harnessing technology that was simply not available at 
the start of the decade, can be had for about $110 an hour. Similar decreases 
have occurred in equipment costs. 
</P>
<P>
For today, video conferencing remains very much the exception, and how far it 
will go remains highly speculative. But in certain sectors of the economy -- 
big aerospace companies, for instance -- virtually everyone already is using it 
to some degree. Most feel they gain a competitive edge through it. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft producer Boeing Co. was a pioneer in the field, building a short-range 
system almost a decade ago to link various Puget Sound facilities that were 
developing the 757 jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
9,000 Meetings 
</P>
<P>
"We . . . had to manage an engineering force that was spread out over a 
geographical area of about 40 miles," recalled W. R. Savery, a senior engineer 
at Boeing who helped put the system together. "It became obvious to us that we 
had to do something better than running up and down the highway." 
</P>
<P>
More than 9,000 meetings have been held on the resulting network. More 
recently, the company has installed eight more rooms around the country linked 
by satellite. Some meetings conducted there are over long distance, others are 
short-haul. Every Wednesday morning, for instance, people at Savery's facility 
in Renton, Wash., confer by satellite with flight test crews in Seattle, just 8 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Marietta Corp. of Bethesda, Md., today has 10 conferencing rooms; Contel 
ASC, a Rockville, Md.-based satellite services company, is operating a network 
that links facilities of Boeing and two other aerospace companies that are 
jointly developing a new generation of jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are also getting more interested. Under a 1986 contract 
with the Defense Communications Agency, AT&amp;T is operating about 70 rooms at 
various military installations. The technology will come soon to many civilian 
agencies through FTS-2000, a mammoth long-distance network that AT&amp;T and US 
Sprint Communications Co. will build and operate for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
The basic technical challenge facing the industry is to "compress" the data 
contained in a video image to lessen the cost of transporting it, in the same 
way that it is cheaper to mail a half-ounce letter than a 10-pound package. 
Technicians have squeezed the signal down to less than 1% the amount of data 
contained in an ordinary TV image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Quality 
</P>
<P>
But the greater the compression, the lower the quality. The picture gets fuzzy, 
motion -- a wave of the hand, for instance -- leaves ghostly trails across the 
screen, and voice quality is like that of a telephone line. Still, each year 
quality gets better and prices get cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to refine the technology and lower costs to the point that someday, 
each desk at a workplace could have a video unit, allowing people to dial up 
others on demand. The precedent for such wide use is there with the personal 
computer, but this goal is by no means just around the corner. "I don't see it 
becoming a general business product in the next five years," said David Keeler, 
a Dataquest analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary consumers will have to wait even longer. "This technology is a long 
way off from being in everybody's homes," said Steve Reynolds, an analyst at 
the New York City research firm Link Resources Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing available so far is the "picturephone," introduced by Japan's 
Mitsubishi Group last year. It can send a still image over an ordinary 
telephone line. Speech is not possible during the approximately 10 seconds that 
the picture transmission takes. 
</P>
<P>
The economic fact driving the industry is that the costs of business travel are 
high and climbing -- air tickets, meals, hotel rooms, not to mention the wasted 
time of executives while they're en route. In foreign travel, there is the 
danger of terrorism and kidnapping. So if people can be put together 
electronically for less money, why not do it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quick Decisions 
</P>
<P>
In addition, decisions can be made more quickly. There is no travel time 
involved, and people taking part tend to come to the point more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Video conferencing provides a level of communication not possible over the 
telephone, adding facial expressions, hand signs and other body English to the 
participants' words. In addition, people can share graphic material -- a sketch 
for a new advertisement, for instance, or a table of the last quarter's sales. 
</P>
<P>
But there is resistance. Lack of technical standards means many rooms cannot 
link up with others. People may find themselves "stepping on each other," as 
they talk out of turn because each image takes a fraction of a second to reach 
its destination. 
</P>
<P>
There are human factors working against it, too: Many people feel uncomfortable 
with the cameras (even though in most rooms they are hidden). 
</P>
<P>
And, however much better the technology gets, some people feel it still does 
not match the quality of communication of a face-to-face encounter.

CRITIC AT LARGE: VERDICT ON WOODS: BRILLIANT AS EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Woods was not a newcomer in "The Onion Field." He'd done a lot of 
impressive work on Broadway and been in two or three earlier films. But as one 
of the cop killers in Joseph Wambaugh's account of an actual case, Woods had a 
lean, clenched, demonic intensity that commandeered the screen. 
</P>
<P>
He has been dominating the screen ever since, whether or not he has had the 
leading role. His tough-talking deprogrammer is the performance I remember from 
"Split Image," about one of the fringe sects. That part was a small 
breakthrough for Woods: He was a good guy, although an unpleasant one. But it 
was a hint, at least, that he was not sentenced to play only lethal loonies the 
rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Woods starred as Joshua in "Joshua Then and Now," playing a badly flawed but 
finally sympathetic protagonist clawing his way up the slopes of society and 
literature. His intensity dominated the Ted Kotcheff film, although it was 
really an ensemble piece, derived from the fine Mordecai Richler novel and with 
strong supporting work from Alan Arkin and others. 
</P>
<P>
"True Believer" Woods regards as his first starring vehicle in the sense that 
it sits squarely on his shoulders to carry or drop. It is, that is, a star 
vehicle tailored to his measurements. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients are to say the least familiar. The burnt-out and cynical lawyer 
could almost be Paul Newman in "The Verdict." Woods chases drug cases instead 
of funerals, but the rebirth of a passionate thirst for justice is the same, 
and the results carry the same kind of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
But the film rises above its familiar ingredients on the thrust of Woods' 
portrayal. Wearing a nappy gray ponytail wig as a surviving symbol from the 
'60s of the lawyer's radical idealism, snarling, posturing, enjoying no one and 
nothing except his unworthy triumphs over a justice system that appears as 
cynical as he is, Woods is a wonder to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the performance is nothing so obvious as a vaudeville turn, all whiz-bang 
charisma. Even in the early going, confounding Robert Downey Jr. as the young 
idealist who thinks he is arriving to work for a later Clarence Darrow, Woods 
gives off glinting hints of the more complicated man within. 
</P>
<P>
The film, directed by Joseph Ruben from a script by Wesley Strick, does not 
provide a lot of back-story on the lawyer's slippage from protest to a kind of 
despondent cynicism. But the audience feels the emptiness of the life, a barren 
solitariness in which the fat cash payments from the acquitted drug dealers 
only deepen his self-loathing despair. There isn't even an understanding 
mistress who shortens the nights and urges the lawyer to better things. 
(Something of this was actually filmed but wisely eliminated.) 
</P>
<P>
But the return of the passion for justice is not an unprepared surprise and the 
lawyer's subsequent ricocheting between hope and a new level of despair when 
defeat seems certain is wonderful to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"True Believer" is indubitably an entertainment, not a social document, with an 
invigorating chase through a plumbing supply factory, a hitherto neglected film 
venue. But one of the several lures of the movies as an art form is performance 
pure and simple -- the chance to watch charismatic actors being their memorable 
best. It is the lure and the strength of "True Believer." 
</P>
<P>
As Woods made overwhelmingly clear in "Salvador," he is one of a handful of 
present film actors who can play supremely well the ordinary modern man -- an 
untidy collusion of evident vices and hidden virtues and strengths -- caught in 
extraordinary situations. 
</P>
<P>
Having made a name playing villains, Woods has now proved he can play heroes 
(however belated and reluctant the heroics), and that on the strength of his 
remarkable kinetic energy he can carry a film. 
</P>
<P>
"True Believer" is not apt to leave much of a mark on film history. But in its 
own way it is a milestone in the emergence of an actor.

UNFOLDING DRAMA OF THEATER;

<P>
GOOD, BAD AND MEDIOCRE AT LATC'S 'BIG WEEKEND' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the 10th year that the Los Angeles Theatre Center (formerly known as 
the Los Angeles Actors' Theatre when the tradition of this festival of 
premieres began) has had one wallop of a "Big Weekend." 
</P>
<P>
For the occasion, the center throws open its doors to the public, which can 
attend the fully produced shows on its four stages and/or attend a daytime diet 
of readings of plays-in-progress (NewWorks Project) and/or developmental work 
in any of its half-dozen labs (the Playwrights' Unit, Asian-American Theatre 
Project, Women's Project, Music Theatre and Black Theatre Labs). 
</P>
<P>
The exercise is unvarnished. No effort is made to impress or significantly 
stage any of the works. Everything takes place in one black box of a rehearsal 
hall where the turkeys are lumped with the trimmings, the barely-begun with the 
almost-completed, and the good, bad and indifferent are exposed to scrutiny and 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
It's a little like seeing a clock in pieces, before it's put together, 
extraneous parts discarded, its mechanism tuned and timed into a ticking 
machine designed to give us the prevailing pulse of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Among the music theater lab works, "Blind Revels or the Dancer's Heel," an 
original beginning-of-a-musical about the lure and misuse of power by Ed Barnes 
and Irene Oppenheim, made us yearn to see and hear more, while "Frozen Futures" 
(by Michael R. Farkash and Miriam Cutler), a deliciously spaced-out fantasy 
about cryogenics and aliens, sent this viewer into a bit of an orbit. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest it was business as usual, with Jonathan Field's "Courting Winona" 
(Playwrights' Unit) more zany screenplay than play until its final moments, and 
Mira-Lani Oglesby's "Increase After Completion" (Women's Project) original but 
redundant by half. 
</P>
<P>
(The writer did not see and cannot comment on the Asian-American Project or the 
Young Playwrights' Lab.) 
</P>
<P>
Of the four NewWorks plays, only Marlane Meyer's "The Geography of Luck" was 
ready for the gatepost. This thoroughbred, written by the author of "Etta 
Jenks" and "Kingfish," is another caustic look at life on the fringes of 
morality and hope -- this time taking place near Las Vegas, where, as one 
character puts it, "The money makes it difficult to see that there is nothing 
there," and where dreamers and their sad dreams rarely fuse. It reinforced the 
perception that Meyer is not only an expert at probing the inert human heart, 
but also performs her societal surgery with a scalpel drenched in wit. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing touched it. Neal Bell's "Ready for the River" was an extended great 
escape story. Cherrie Moraga 's "Shadow of a Man" (of which this writer saw 
half) was another Latino family play, this one undermined by dramatic stasis 
and a multitude of cliches. 
</P>
<P>
Most disappointing was Edward and Mildred Lewis' "Spring Street," an updating 
of Gorki's "Lower Depths" designed to reflect the condition of the homeless on 
the streets outside this theater. It turned out to be a simplistic effort that 
advertised its enlightened liberalism but wallowed in romantic stereotypes: 
evil slumlord, alcoholic actor, goody-two-shoes social worker, noble activist, 
innocent from Iowa, whore with fantasies of gold. Worthiness without stage 
worthiness is a deadly combination. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the weekend, a young woman had a seizure on the sidewalk 
outside the theater. A cop was there and an ambulance arrived in minutes. But 
the sight of the real thing stood in defiance of any mawkishness on stage. The 
center may be the only theater in town where more dramatic events go on outside 
than in. It is starting to define itself not only as eclectic and multiethnic, 
but as having a taste for investigations, good or bad, of the social underbelly 
typified by the one in which it rests.

UNFOLDING DRAMA OF THEATER;

<P>
PANELISTS GAUGE PRESENT, FUTURE STATES OF THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ambiguous, present-future time warp suggested by the title of a symposium 
held Saturday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center -- "State of the Art: Theatre 
in the 21st Century" -- was reflected in the discussion itself. Symposium 
participants cast a wary eye on the upcoming decades, while lamenting theater's 
current condition. 
</P>
<P>
Moderator Morgan Jenness, consulting dramaturg to New York's Public Theatre and 
LATC, led the sometimes rambling discussion -- a part of LATC's "Big Weekend" 
-- through an assessment of the art's ability to survive the combined gauntlets 
of technology, government's and education's neglect of culture, and its ability 
to realize the opportunities of an increasingly multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Eduardo Machado, however, resolutely chose to remain in the present, 
sparing criticism of no one in the theater world, especially his fellow scribes 
and the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in real trouble," he declared, recalling recent works in New York that 
literally made him nauseous. For not publicly complaining about unspecified 
problems with National Endowment for the Arts funding for playwrights, he 
referred to his fellow authors as "cowards. Where but in the U.S. do you have 
playwrights who are afraid to speak out on this issue?" 
</P>
<P>
Writers are afraid of being labelled as rebels, Machado argued, for it lessens 
their chances of entering the movie and TV world. But radical, challenging 
forms and themes, the panel generally agreed, are the only bulwark against 
mediocre theater. 
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that that kind of theater was everywhere, while the leading 
edge was begging for money. Resident LATC designer and Norwegian stage artist 
Timian Alsaker, observing matters from across the Atlantic, asked rhetorically, 
"Why doesn't this country view continued support for its culture as absolutely 
important?" 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, reminded UC San Diego theater professor Jorge Huerta and 
playwright Velina Hasu Houston, peoples of color are a potentially large 
audience (read: ticket buyers) who will come -- "if they can see their concerns 
and passions addressed on stage," said Houston. "The present reality is that 
wherever you go, the audience is white." 
</P>
<P>
That's because, Machado noted, resident theaters supposedly nurturing new work 
rely on "middle-class audiences, who always demand safe plays." 
</P>
<P>
Machado went further: "Audiences ultimately don't matter, regardless of how 
many post-play, audience-artist discussions theaters arrange. Playwrights write 
for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Huerta strongly disputed this, saying that "this theater person doesn't have 
contempt for the audience, (who) can't be blamed for theater's problems." 
</P>
<P>
As for the 21st Century, Jenness asked panelists for "wish list" items. Houston 
hoped for "all artists, not only the playwrights, to be braver, and for 
theaters to not assume that audiences have an 8th grade educational level." 
Times' theater critic Sylvie Drake wished for "a theater of language," a Los 
Angeles theater scene that's focused on itself "rather than looking for 
validation from New York," and for education to emphasize the quintessential 
value of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Thomas Babe posed the heretical suggestion that "each resident 
theater should go out of business every 10 years, before it becomes old and 
tired." Huerta desired a more complete training program for theater artists 
"before they're professionals." Machado wanted theaters to produce "the plays 
they were most afraid of doing, either because they're too controversial or the 
cast is bigger than six. If they did that, theaters might surprise themselves."

'LITTLE JAZZ' LEFT HIS MARK AS A GIANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Roy (Little Jazz) Eldridge died on Sunday, it was obvious, whatever the 
official cause of death, that he was the victim of a broken heart. His wife of 
53 years, Viola, had recently died, and Eldridge, 78, felt he had nothing to 
live for. (In a bizarre coincidence, Eldridge's cousin Reunald Jones Sr. also 
died Sunday in Los Angeles. He, too, was 78 and played trumpet in many name 
bands.) 
</P>
<P>
Eldridge had been forced to put down his trumpet forever after suffering a 
stroke in 1980, and had been seen publicly since then only in occasional 
appearances singing and playing drums. 
</P>
<P>
My first exposure to Eldridge was a magical evening in 1936 at Harlem's Savoy 
Ballroom; he was with Teddy Hill's memorable band, with saxophonist "Chu" Berry 
as the other principal soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Because Eldridge was unknown then, having made almost no records, his unique, 
searing sound and impassioned style came as a revelation. After he and Berry 
joined the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra he began to achieve recognition as the 
first major trumpet influence since Louis Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, in 1938, Roy played at the Three Deuces with an incredible small 
band. Art Tatum was at the piano; John Collins was the guitarist, Zutty 
Singleton the drummer. This was Swing era combo music at its supreme level. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1940, Milt Gabler and I produced a session for Commodore Records with 
Eldridge, Benny Carter and Coleman Hawkins in the front line. Roy's solos in 
this intimate setting became classics that have been reissued time and again. 
</P>
<P>
He played alongside Louis Armstrong for their first joint appearance in the 
Esquire Allstars concert at the Metropolitan Opera House. Roy's disposition 
always seemed happy and outgoing; it was not until after his later experiences 
with Jim Crow that bitterness surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
He was the only black musician in Gene Krupa's band from 1941-43, one of 
several blacks in an all-star band on Mildred Bailey's CBS radio series in 
1943-44, then became the only black with Artie Shaw's band in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
After he left Shaw he told me of his humiliating experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm in America," he said, "I'll never work in a white band again! 
It all goes back to when I joined Gene Krupa. It thrilled me to be accepted as 
a regular member of the band, but I knew that all eyes were on me to see if I'd 
do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"All the guys in the band were nice, Gene especially. Then we headed for 
California and the trouble began. We arrive in one town and the rest of the 
band checks in. I can't get into their hotel, so I keep my bags and start 
looking for another place. I get to where someone is supposed to have made a 
reservation for me; then the clerk sees me, suddenly discovers that a regular 
tenant just arrived and took the last available room. I lug my dozen pieces of 
luggage back onto the street and start looking again. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time that kind of thing has happened night after night, it begins to 
work on my mind; I can't think right, I can't play right. When we finally got 
to the Palladium in Hollywood, I had to watch who I could sit at tables with. 
If they were movie stars who wanted me to come over, that was all right; if 
they were just the jitterbugs, no dice. And all the time the bouncer with his 
eye on me, just watching for a chance. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I had to live way out in Los Angeles, while the rest of the guys stayed in 
Hollywood. It was a lonely life. One night the tension got so bad I flipped. I 
started trembling, ran off the stand and threw up. They carried me to the 
doctor's. I had 105 (degree) fever; my nerves were shot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went back a few nights later, I heard that people had been asking for 
their money back because they couldn't hear 'Let Me Off Uptown.' This time they 
let me sit at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"Later on, when I was with Artie Shaw, I went to a dance date and they wouldn't 
even let me in the place. 'This is a white dance,' they said, and there was my 
name right outside. I told them who I was. When I finally did get in, I played 
that first set, trying to keep from crying. By the time I got through the set, 
the tears were rolling down my cheeks. I went up to a dressing room and stood 
in a corner crying and saying to myself why the hell did I come out here again 
when I knew what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Artie came in and he was real great. He made the guy apologize that wouldn't 
let me in, and got him fired. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, when you're on the stage, you're great, but as soon as you come off, 
you're nothing. It's not worth the glory, not worth the money, not worth 
anything. Never again!" 
</P>
<P>
Happily, Eldridge did not have to live up to his resolution. Conditions 
improved a little, and by 1949 he was back in the Krupa band. The following 
year he worked with Benny Goodman, touring Europe, then stayed on the Continent 
playing with everyone from Sidney Bechet to Charlie Parker and recording, among 
other things, a delightful blues vocal in French, "Tu Disais Que Tu m'Aimais." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the rest of his playing career was with mixed bands, most notably on 
tour with Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic (named for Los Angeles' 
Philharmonic Auditorium). He also co-led a quintet with Coleman Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Eldridge was to the evolution of jazz trumpet in the 1930s and early '40s 
what Armstrong had been in the '20s, and what Dizzy Gillespie would be from the 
mid-'40s, what Miles Davis would be in the '50s. He recorded with everyone from 
Art Tatum and Harry (Sweets) Edison and Oscar Peterson and Bud Freeman, with a 
string ensemble with a Dixieland band. 
</P>
<P>
How it must have rankled him, during those last eight years when playing was 
forbidden to him, to see so many avenues opening up. What a joy it would have 
been to share his company, and his sound, at the jazz parties and on the jazz 
cruises. The last time we talked, a year ago, he sounded as cheerful as ever. 
If he was laughing on the outside and still crying on the inside, he did a 
magnificent job of concealing it. 
</P>
<P>
Ave atque vale, Little Jazz.

'DUTCH' TREAT INAUGURATES TAPER'S PAY-WHAT-YOU-CAN TICKET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Mark Taper Forum this week introduces a pay-what-you-can policy at three 
performances of "Dutch Landscape," Jon Robin Baitz's account of a troubled 
American family in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 tickets for tonight's performance, and for those on Wednesday and 
Thursday, can be purchased at whatever price the theatergoer chooses (minimum 
payment: 1 cent) instead of the normal range of $20 to $26. The policy will 
continue at one or two selected performances of each Taper main-stage 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the competition of $6.50 movies and $1.50 videos, Taper managing 
director Stephen J. Albert said: "The Taper has never wanted economics to be 
the reason people don't come to the theater. When you have a show that isn't 
selling out, you pick up people this way -- and they'll get into a 
theater-going habit and later pay full price or become subscribers." 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Playhouse offers a similar deal at one performance of each show.

'ORANGES' WINS HAZELTON THE HONOR OF VYING FOR ARTS SPACE IN CENTENNIAL CAPSULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Aster Hazelton has won a chance to go down in history. At least a couple of 
feet down. 
</P>
<P>
As top winner of the Costa Mesa Arts League's Orange County Centennial Fine 
Arts Show, Hazelton's "Oranges," a large oil painting of a bough heavy with 
jumbo-size blossoms and fruit, will vie with the winners of four other county 
art shows for a place in the official Orange County Centennial time capsule. 
</P>
<P>
The capsule, which will also contain a collection of official documents and 
local memorabilia, will be buried Aug. 1 during a special ceremony on the 
grounds of the Old Orange County Centennial Committee. The other four art shows 
in the competition will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa show drew 342 entries from U.S. amateurs and professionals. 
Ninety-four pieces were picked for an exhibit at South Coast Plaza's Crystal 
Court, which opened Thursday and will run through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Challis, who owned and operated the Challis Gallery in Laguna Beach for 
35 years, was guest juror. Awards were given based on the work's application of 
the show theme, "Orange County Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow," and for general 
excellence in five mediums: oil, aqua, drawing, photography and the 
three-dimensional. Cash prizes ranged from $100 to $300. 
</P>
<P>
Local landmarks abound at the show like so many picture postcards, from the 
Balboa amusement park seen in Janet Shepardson's oil, "Fun Zone, the Way It 
Was" (a nostalgic look at the park in its heyday, it won the "Yesterday" theme 
award) to the Newport Beach Cannery and the Old Irvine Granary, in watercolors 
by Barbara Lawson and Marlene Rogers, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The Duke himself even puts in an appearance in "Gritty Newport Resident," 
Richard DeSpain's oversize, highly detailed pencil drawing of John Wayne. The 
"Today" theme award went to Mary Monge for her watercolor "On the Boardwalk." 
The "Tomorrow" award went to Sotiris for a mixed-medium piece called "Chorus." 
</P>
<P>
Like Hazelton, Cynthia Joy Wygren paid tribute to the county's namesake with an 
austere ink-and-pencil rendering entitled "Oranges," the top prize winner in 
the drawing category. Some prize winners departed from the theme: Jim 
Velasquez's "Kissing Indians," first-place winner in the aqua category, shows a 
pair of rhinoceroses in a tender encounter; "Sentinel," Patrick Lee's 
contemporary wood sculpture, is a cluster of stark, shepherd's crook-like 
shapes, airbrushed with bright acrylics. 
</P>
<P>
The first-place prize for oils went to "Venice Ladies" by Ron Elstad. The top 
photography prize went to "Eucalyptus" by Maurice B. Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Erica Elliott's pastoral "Laguna Canyon" earned a special nod, the Richard 
Challis Award for Excellence. The tranquil, contemporary watercolor/collage 
shows a handful of sleepy-eyed cows grazing against a gentle blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
According to Darrell Metzger, president of the Orange County Centennial 
Committee, the competitions were started to "heighten the awareness of the 
centennial celebration among the community. With this contest format, we're 
able to get a lot more people involved. 
</P>
<P>
"By working with local arts organizations, we are offering (the community) 
something a little unusual. Not everybody has the chance to put a piece in a 
time capsule that will be opened 100 years from now. It's a rare opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Centennial Fine Arts Exhibit continues daily through Monday 
on the ground floor of South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court, 3333 Bear St., Costa 
Mesa. Most of the pieces are available for purchase, with prices ranging from 
$100 to $4,500. Hours are 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 
p.m. Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Admission is free.

SOPRANO VOIGT IN FULLERTON RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE BURROUGHS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hometown recitals can be very encouraging events, as Deborah Voigt discovered 
Saturday night at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The prize-winning soprano, a native Californian and Fullerton alumna, possesses 
a strong, bright voice -- and it has a heft, once taken for granted in opera, 
that now has become the exception rather than the rule. Understandably, she is 
looked to with an unusual degree of hope by voice-fanciers, who were out in 
force and prompt with acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
That said, her voice is not an instrument of especially alluring timbre, with 
the brassy, penetrating top overbalancing the rather cloudy middle by a 
considerable margin: Only the lower range manifests consistent warmth. The tone 
tends to the searing rather than the endearing, and Voigt is generally unable 
to modify her output on behalf of intimate expression. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups of songs were very well vocalized in a broad-stroke sort of way, 
Voigt's solid, unmannered singing at least avoiding the precious-fussy 
syndrome. Yet Wolf's "Auch kleine dinge" fails without a petit-point approach, 
while "Kennst du das Land?" founders when nothing is held in reserve for the 
musical high point. 
</P>
<P>
Two Brahms songs missed real legato, a sense of light and shade, and the 
expansiveness for their long, arching phrases. On the other hand, Voigt soared 
through Strauss' "Zueignung." 
</P>
<P>
She poured forth sound impressively in arias from "Lohengrin," "La Wally," 
"Adriana Lecouvreur" and "Aida." But opera is not all forte, and she was 
defeated by the soft phrases ending Adriana's dreamy entrance aria and the 
prayer closing Aida's "Ritorna vincitor." 
</P>
<P>
Selections by Herbert, Gershwin, Loewe and Rodgers were the audience pleasers, 
especially with CSUF voice teacher Jane Paul as spirited pianist. Rita Borden 
accompanied all else sympathetically, inventing many new harmonies along the 
way.

After weeks of pondering who to appoint as executive producer of the new Sam 
Donaldson-Diane Sawyer prime-time news series, ABC News President Roone Arledge 
on Monday named Phyllis McGrady to the post. 
</P>
<P>
Her appointment was part of a management shuffle in which veteran executive Av 
Westin, whose contract expires at the end of next month, was replaced as head 
of long-form programming at ABC News. 
</P>
<P>
Until moving to ABC News last September, McGrady had been executive producer of 
ABC Entertainment's "Barbara Walters Specials" since 1986. Before that, she ran 
"Good Morning America" for two years. 
</P>
<P>
McGrady rejoined the network's news division, for which she previously worked, 
when she and another ABC News executive, Dorrance Smith, were assigned to help 
develop a new prime-time news series for the news division. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was named Monday as Westin's successor as executive in charge of 
long-form programming, specials and documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
The new series on which Smith and McGrady had been working is the one that will 
be co-anchored by Donaldson and Sawyer, who made headlines earlier this month 
when she left CBS' "60 Minutes" for the ABC job. 
</P>
<P>
The new, untitled ABC News series probably will premiere in August, possibly on 
Thursday nights, an ABC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, executive producer of ABC's weekend news programs since 1980, will 
continue for the time being as executive producer of "This Week With David 
Brinkley," the ABC spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Westin, who joined ABC News in 1969 as executive producer of its weeknight 
evening news programs, is having "amicable" discussions with Arledge about 
possible future posts, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Westin was suspended for four months by Arledge, and relieved of his 
job as executive producer of "20/20." Although no reason for the suspension 
ever was given, the action occurred after an internal memo written by Westin 
found its way into the hands of reporters. Written in response to Arledge's 
request to senior executives for ways to restructure "World News Tonight," the 
memo implied that ABC News had grown too fat and wasted money and manpower. 
</P>
<P>
Westin will continue working on two prime-time projects that he had under way 
before Monday's announcement, the spokeswoman said.

The Administration's efforts to salvage John Tower's nomination as defense 
secretary suffered a setback today when Republican Sen. Larry Pressler of South 
Dakota announced that he was "very much leaning against" confirmation and urged 
Tower to withdraw before a vote. 
</P>
<P>
The President, meanwhile, launched a full-court press, meeting privately with a 
dozen swing Democrats and wavering Republicans in hopes of persuading them to 
back Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Pressler said he was fearful that Tower would not be capable of cleaning up the 
Pentagon procurement system if confirmed and said he should withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do Bush a 'Favor' 
</P>
<P>
"I think that (by withdrawing) he may very well be doing him (Bush) a favor in 
this case," Pressler said. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that there was "no chance 
whatsoever" of the President withdrawing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to fight it out as far as we can. We've convinced a lot of 
senators, and we hope to convince a lot more," said Fitzwater, who refused to 
specify what senators had been won over. 
</P>
<P>
With Democrats holding a 55-45 majority in the Senate, Republicans can 
ill-afford any defections from their own ranks if Bush is to prevail in the 
first high-stakes political showdown of his 5-week-old presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Formal debate on the nomination is scheduled to open Wednesday, and senators 
are reading a confidential FBI report on the former Texas senator's drinking 
habits, charges of womanizing and lucrative consulting contracts with military 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Bush invited several Democrats and Republicans to the White House for a series 
of one-on-one meetings to discuss the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who has not announced his 
position, did not talk with reporters as he left the White House. Sen. J. James 
Exon (D-Neb.) has said he expected Mitchell will oppose the nomination, which 
has failed thus far to attract the public support of any Democratic senator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Morning Meetings 
</P>
<P>
The President held early morning meetings with Sens. John B. Breaux (D-La.), J. 
Bennett Johnston (D-La.) and Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
Bush also scheduled individual meetings with Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the 
ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sens. Charles S. 
Robb (D-Va.), Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) and Bill Bradley (D-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle told a hastily called news conference that he 
believes that all 45 Republican senators, including Pressler, will vote for 
Tower. If five Democrats can be persuaded to vote for Tower, that would allow 
Quayle to cast the decisive, tie-breaking vote for the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Later today, Bush said he did not know whether he could win over senators who 
have indicated opposition to Tower, saying only that "I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
But with Tower sitting on his left in the Cabinet Room, the President said he 
had not heard anyone "challenge this man's knowledge and his ability." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best to do the job that needs to be done," Bush said.

U.S. immigration officials overnight seized 69 suspected illegal aliens about 
to board the same cross-country flight at Los Angeles International Airport on 
which 79 undocumented immigrants were taken into custody the night before, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 69 were trying to board Eastern Airlines Flight 80 to New York by way of 
Atlanta, said Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Joe Flanders. He 
said 54 were from Mexico, seven from El Salvador, four from Colombia and four 
from Guatemala. Most will be allowed to go home or request a deportation 
hearing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flanders said one man was arrested and may have been the principal smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, authorities seized 79 illegal aliens during Flight 80's 5:35 a.m. 
stopover in Atlanta, acting on tips from airline sources and someone who often 
traveled the route and became suspicious of fellow passengers.

BUSH HITS 'VERSES' FIREBOMBINGS, SAYS U.S. WILL NOT TOLERATE VIOLENCE

President Bush, denouncing firebombings that may be linked to Salman Rushdie's 
controversial novel "The Satanic Verses," warned today he will not tolerate 
violent protests in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This country was founded on the principles of free speech and religious 
tolerance," Bush told reporters during a question-and-answer session following 
a Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it perfectly clear the United States will not tolerate any 
assault on these rights," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The offices of an outspoken New York City weekly newspaper were heavily damaged 
by a firebomb early today along with two bookstores in Berkeley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't yet know if the bombings are related to the book 'The Satanic 
Verses,' " Bush said, "but let me be clear, anyone undertaking acts of 
intimidation or violence aimed at the author, the publishers or the 
distributors of 'The Satanic Verses' will be prosecuted to the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was directing Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to determine whether any 
federal laws had been violated in the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverdale Press in New York City had run an editorial endorsing the novel. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's execution has been ordered by Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini, who alleges the book defames the prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people have been killed and hundreds injured in Muslim 
demonstrations throughout the world against the book. Another 25 people were 
injured in the Indian city of Srinagar today in a second day of anti-Rushdie 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's call for Muslims to kill Rushdie has outraged many Western countries and 
provoked the recall of top diplomats by the European Community members and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Parliament today voted to cut ties with Britain, where the 
Indian-born Rushdie lives, unless it declares within a week "its opposition to 
the unprincipled stands against the world of Islam, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the contents of the anti-Islamic book 'The Satanic Verses.' "

SUSPECT IN DIAMOND BAR ROBBERY, SLAYING ARRESTED IN COSTA MESA

<P>
A suspect in the slaying of a Diamond Bar woman was arrested this morning at a 
Costa Mesa motel, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen David Brooks, 42, is suspected of being the man who entered a Diamond Bar 
check cashing store Dec. 15, 1988, and shot Belinda Brecke, 31, with a 
sawed-off shotgun. The killer fled with $10,000 to $15,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary Webster said Brooks is also suspected of holding up 
two Orange County restaurants Monday and escaping with an undetermined amount 
of money. The description provided after those robberies fit the description of 
the man wanted for the Diamond Bar killing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Mesa officer on routine patrol about 3 a.m. today spotted a Dodge van 
that fit the description of a getaway vehicle used in the Costa Mesa robberies. 
Police set up a small SWAT team outside the hotel where the van was parked 
about 6:30 a.m., and Brooks surrendered 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks remains in the custody of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which 
handles prisoners for Diamond Bar.

UNIONS DEALT NEW SETBACK IN TWA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
RULING FAVORS WORKERS WHO CROSS PICKET LINES OVER STRIKERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major setback for organized labor, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that 
employees who cross the picket line during a strike can keep their jobs, 
displacing returning strikers with more seniority. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3 decision was the latest in a series of high court rulings that have cut 
back on the legal rights of unions and their members during and after a strike, 
giving business more economic leverage during contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Although the case was brought under the Railway Labor Act, which specifically 
covers airlines and railroads, the court's opinion will also set labor law 
precedent for other industries. 
</P>
<P>
The justices overturned a ruling last May by a U.S. Court of Appeals in St. 
Louis that would have required Trans World Airlines Inc. to hire back about 
1,500 flight attendants who went on strike and to pay them about $55 million in 
back pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bitter Strike 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from a bitter, 10-week strike that began March 7, 1986, 
involving a dispute over wage and benefit concessions demanded by the airline's 
owner, corporate raider Carl Icahn. 
</P>
<P>
During the strike, TWA hired more than 1,200 new flight attendants and 
instituted the lower wages and longer hours that it was seeking. About 1,200 
union members crossed the picket line and continued working. 
</P>
<P>
The court majority, consisting of its conservative justices, held that there 
was nothing in the federal common labor law indicating that TWA's policy was 
unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
"An employer is not required by the (Railway Labor Act) to lay off junior 
crossover employees in order to reinstate more senior full-term strikers at the 
conclusion of the strike," Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court 
majority in the 16-page opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the company's action encouraged workers to cross the picket line, 
O'Connor said TWA was simply carrying out its lawful economic power. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling provoked a strongly worded dissent from Justice William J. Brennan 
Jr., who said that the company's policy illegally discriminated against the 
strikers and that such bias is "inherently destructive" of the right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I would favor -- and I believe Congress has provided for -- the rule that errs 
on the side of preferring solidarity and seniority rather than a rule that 
would permit the employer to discriminate on the basis of protected union 
activity," said Brennan, the court's leading liberal member. 
</P>
<P>
He said the court's decision "will mean that an employee of only six months' 
experience, who abandoned the strike one day before it ended, could displace a 
20-year veteran who chose to remain faithful to the decision made collectively 
with her fellow workers until the group as a whole decided to end the strike."

Local governments may be forced to pay monetary damages to people whose rights 
are violated by inadequately trained public employees, the Supreme Court ruled 
unanimously today. 
</P>
<P>
Ruling in a case from Canton, Ohio, the justices said cities and towns may be 
held legally accountable if the inadequate training stemmed from governmental 
"deliberate indifference." 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion written by Justice Byron R. White, the court said the inadequate 
training also must be closely related to the ultimate injury suffered before 
local governments can be forced to pay damages. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, although a potential threat to municipal treasuries nationwide, 
might not result in numerous successful lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
White said the court was imposing a stringent standard for those filing such 
suits because any lesser standard would open local governments to 
"unprecedented liability" and saddle federal courts with "an endless exercise 
of second-guessing municipal employee-training programs." 
</P>
<P>
The court previously had ruled that the local government is not liable unless 
the injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setback for Canton 
</P>
<P>
Today's decision is a setback, but not a final defeat, for Canton officials who 
sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who said police violated her rights by 
failing to get needed medical attention for her after she was arrested for 
speeding. 
</P>
<P>
The city was sued by Geraldine Harris, who was arrested in April, 1978, on a 
speeding violation while driving her daughter to school. 
</P>
<P>
She became incoherent after her arrest and slumped to the floor in the police 
station. However, police did not call for medical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
After her release, a doctor determined she was suffering from several emotional 
ailments requiring hospitalization and subsequent outpatient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found Harris was unreasonably denied medical attention and awarded her 
$200,000. However, the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back for 
a new trial and the city appealed to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling returned the case to the 6th Circuit, which can now order a new 
trial or dismiss the suit.

Israeli warplanes today bombed and rocketed the Shouf Mountains southeast of 
Beirut, and police said two Palestinian guerrillas were killed and 33 people 
were injured -- including 26 children. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the casualties were reported in the village of Ainab, 
10 miles southeast of Beirut. He said the dead guerrillas were members of Naif 
Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO 
faction. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who cannot be named under police regulations, said the children 
were wounded by shrapnel and flying glass in Ainab's elementary school, about 
200 yards from the base of the guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
He said a rocket fired by one of six Israeli jets slammed into an empty lot 
about 25 yards south of the school. 
</P>

Democratic Front spokesman Suheil Natour said the group's base in Ainab "took 
several direct hits."

Use of crack cocaine has declined among high school seniors because of changing 
attitudes and increased knowledge about the drug's harmful effects, a survey 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 National High School Senior Survey, conducted by the University of 
Michigan's Institute for Social Research, found use of all drugs generally 
declined among American students in high school and college. Overall, the 
proportion of seniors using any illicit drug during the prior year fell from 
42% in 1987 to 39% in 1988. This compares with 54% in 1979, the peak year. 
</P>
<P>
The study's director, Lloyd Johnston, said the drop in the use of crack -- a 
highly addictive smokeable derivative of cocaine -- is one of the most 
important findings of the survey of about 16,000 to 17,000 seniors in 135 high 
schools nationwide. The survey was funded by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services.

A group of aviation industry and government safety experts recommended today 
$800-million worth of mandatory work on older airliners to ensure safety of the 
nation's aging airliner fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented program, if adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration, 
would affect more than 1,300 early Boeing 747, 737 and 727 models at a cost of 
over $600,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
The Aging Aircraft Task Force's working group on older Boeing airliners was 
organized by the Air Transport Assn., which represents major airlines.

Nurses and some other employees struck Merced Community Medical Center today 
for the second time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Pickets turned up at the hospital at 5 a.m. following failure to reach a 
contract agreement during an all-day negotiating session on Monday. Gene Stamm, 
business agent for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal 
Employees, said the union's main concern is hiring more nurses to ease what it 
considers an unsafe ratio of nurses to patients. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the nursing staff struck for 17 days in May, 1987, before a 
settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Administrator William Gilbert said the hospital would put a contingency plan 
into effect to continue services.

Sales of existing homes fell 7.4% in January after a sharp jump in activity in 
December, a real estate trade group reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said existing single-family homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units in January after a 5.7% 
rise in December. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in sales did not dampen prices. The median price of a home sold in 
January rose 3.2% from the December level to $91,500. 
</P>
<P>
The January sales decline had been expected, given the level of activity in 
December, when homes were being sold at the fastest pace in two years.

The good news for Boston Celtics fans is that Larry Bird, sidelined since 
mid-November with bone spur surgery on both heels, has participated in his 
first 90-minute workout with the team since his operation. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that his right heel was in pain throughout the practice, and 
team officials say he is not yet ready to see game action. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a hard workout," Bird said Monday. "We'll talk about it tomorrow, 
see how it feels and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
"Larry was rusty out there," center Robert Parish said. "But he looked pretty 
good, considering how long he has been out. He was tentative. But that's to be 
expected." 
</P>
<P>
There is no set date for Bird's return. On Nov. 19, the date of his surgery, 
speculation centered on a comeback sometime in late March. 
</P>
<P>
"If he continues to make progress like this, I would expect him back in the 
near future," coach Jimmy Rodgers said. "But this is just a checkpoint."

University of Colorado center Shaun Vandiver said his mother and junior college 
coach have received inquiries from other colleges, including Minnesota and 
DePaul, asking how content he is at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver, a junior in his first season with the Buffs, drew attention to 
himself last month with a 27-point, 14-rebound performance on national 
television against Iowa State. He leads Colorado University in 10 statistical 
categories and is the only player on the team who has started every game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver said Monday that "several" coaches have talked to his mother in 
Romeoville, Ill., but he would identify only two of them, calling both "friends 
of the family." They are Minnesota coach Clem Haskins, who recruited Vandiver 
two years ago for Western Kentucky, and Doug Bruno, the women's basketball 
coach at DePaul. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (other) schools have said something to my mother, and others have called 
my junior college coach," said Vandiver. "But I can't say who. I don't want to 
bring down some kind of big investigation on anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA prohibits coaches from making "direct or indirect contact" with 
players who are on scholarship at another school without first receiving 
permission from the player's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'No One Would Ask Me' 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver's former junior college coach, Dave Farrar of Hutchinson Community 
College in Kansas, said he had not been asked whether Vandiver was content at 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"No one would ask me that," Farrar said. "And that (transferring) wouldn't be 
anything that he would consider. He's a smart, loyal kid." 
</P>
<P>
Vandiver said he is not considering a transfer. If he did, he would have to sit 
out one of his two remaining years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not crazy," he said. "I'm not going to leave here. This is the best place 
for me. It would be selfish of me to leave here. I knew the record when I came 
in, I knew the struggles we were in for." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado, 7-18 overall and 2-10 and in last place in the Big Eight Conference, 
plays its final home game Wednesday night against Iowa State.

IRAN THREATENS BREAK WITH BRITAIN OVER 'VERSES'

Iran's Parliament voted today to break diplomatic relations with Britain in one 
week unless London changes its "hostile stance" to the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini's death decree against author Salman Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
Britain refused to bow to the Iranian ultimatum. 
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that 100 of 180 deputies 
present in the 270-member legislature, known as the Majlis, voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
It was Parliament's response to Britain's leading the 12-member European 
Community in pulling its diplomats from Tehran after a death threat issued by 
Khomeini against the Indian-born British author of "The Satanic Verses." 
Rushdie's novel is considered blasphemous by Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian news agency said the Majlis would give Britain a week to 
"reconsider its unprincipled stand on the contents of 'The Satanic Verses' 
before ordering the Iranian Foreign Ministry to cut off all diplomatic ties." 
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted one deputy, Hussein Mahlouji, as saying that "if Britain 
apologized and regretted the contents of 'The Satanic Verses' and said it had 
no part in the production of the book, it would be a great political victory 
for Iran." 
</P>
<P>
In London, British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said Britain 
regrets the Iranian Parliament's threat to sever diplomatic relations but will 
not change its stance concerning Rushdie. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the British position will not be altered by threats of that kind," 
Waldegrave said. "We regret the statement and hope Iranian leaders will 
consider again what so many international leaders have now said to them, that 
they have an obligation to behave within international law." 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons today that 
freedom of speech and expression are "subject only to the laws of this land ... 
and will remain subject to the rule of law." 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely fundamental to everything in which we believe and cannot be 
interfered with by any outside force," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fact about 100 lawmakers of the 270-member Parliament were absent from the 
vote fueled speculation among political observers that there are some moderates 
among the ruling clergy who oppose Iran's current anti-Western policy because 
it may damage Iran's oil-based economy and further delay its economic recovery 
from its 8-year war with Iraq.
